  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- UNIAN has learned that 
Ukrainian People's Deputy Volodymyr Bortnyk fell victim to an 
armed attack at 0915 today. Some sources name him as one of the 
promising candidates for the post of agriculture minister in 
Ukraine's new government. 
  Volodymyr Bortnyk, a mechanical engineer, is chairman of the 
board of directors at Ukragrotechservis concern. He is a 
non-party man living in Kiev, and was elected people's deputy in 
Izyaslavskiy constituency No. 413 (Khmelnitskiy oblast). 
  Bortnyk was walking out of his house on 4 Vynohradna Street 
toward a Volvo-940 office car when he was shot twice by a 
stranger using a small-bore gun. The first bullet hit his head, 
while the second went in his shoulder. Volodymyr Bortnyk is 
currently in a neurosurgical ward in the hospital. 
  UNIAN has learned that robbery is believed to be the likely 
motive of the armed attack. While in an ambulance car, 
Volodymyr Bortnyk said his attache case and a package had 
disappeared. However, the attacker did not take Bortnyk's folder 
with money. A detective group from the Kiev Directorate for 
Internal Affairs and representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of 
Internal Affairs central office are working at the scene of the 
shooting.

  [Text] Kiev -- The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and 
National Bank of Ukraine [NBU] adopted a joint resolution on 28 
May "On the Withdrawal from Circulation of Coupons with a 
Nominal Value of 10 and 25 Karbovantsi." Proceeding from the 
inexpediency of further using these banknotes in cash settlement 
operations, the Cabinet of Ministers and the NBU have obliged 
regional boards of the NBU and commercial banks to ensure that 
the 10 and 25 karbovantsi banknotes are withdrawn from 
circulation by 1 August. Banknotes that have been withdrawn 
will be kept in regional NBU branches until the NBU decides on 
the issue of their recovery. The banknotes remain legal tender 
by all entities of entrepreneurial activity, regardless of their 
form of activity, by banks, and by enterprises of the Ministry 
of Communications until the time limit determined by the 
resolution. The resolution says that in connection with this, 
from 1 June the setting of retail prices for goods, services, 
and works should be carried out in figures that are a multiple 
of 50.

  [Text] Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin has 
emphasized that there are no differences between the Interior 
Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) as 
represented by some parts of the media. Speaking at a 
nation-wide conference in the FCS in Moscow Friday, he called 
for combined efforts and coordinated activities by the 
law-enforcement bodies in the struggle against crime which had 
corrupted many state offices, the FCS public relations center 
told Interfax. 
  The conference was attended by officials of the Prosecutor's 
Office, State Customs Committee, Supreme Court, tax police and 
border guards. 
  Yerin said that revealing traitors was equally important for 
all agencies. "We struggle for the honor of the law-enforcement 
bodies, removing those who cooperate with criminals," he was 
quoted as saying. 
  In Yerin's opinion, supported by the FCS Director Sergey 
Stepashin, it is necessary to develop an agreement between the 
Interior Ministry and the FCS clearly defining their interaction 
in critical and emergency situation. 
  Acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko said that crime 
had expanded in Russia recently. He called for the return of 
investigation units which used to be the most professional 
structures within the Russian Security Ministry specializing on 
specially grave crimes.

Affairs Ministry will be increased by 52,000 units. This is 
provided for in the federal program for stepping up the fight 
against crime in 1994-1995, which has been sanctioned by the 
president. In accordance with the program, the rights of the 
militia will be expanded. It is proposed that it should be 
granted the right to inspect the buildings of enteprises and 
institutions, irrespective of the type of ownership, in cases 
where information is available that a crime is to be committed. 
The rules are to be changed regarding the use of weapons by law 
enforcement bodies staff during the fulfillment of their 
official duties. It is planned to set up special militia 
subunits to escort long-distance trains and suburban trains.

<F P=106> [Speech by Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin at the </F>
conference of leadership personnel of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service: "I Demand That You Act Vigorously, 
Bravely, and Decisively"] 
  [Text] The aim of our meeting today is to map out 
paths to develop the service and define its place and role in 
the overall system of ensuring Russia's security in today's 
conditions. 
  Profound economic and political reforms are under way in the 
country. People's way of life is being turned upside down. 
Global changes are occurring in the international situation. 
  Russia must take its proper place in the world community and 
ensure effective protection of its independence, integrity, and 
historical identity. 
  This is precisely why the country needs strong and 
combatable 
special services both today and in the future, and this includes 
the counterintelligence organs. 
  We need new approaches to the system of ensuring the 
security of the Russian Federation. 
  First and foremost we need an accurate, professional, and 
prompt analysis of many factors and circumstances in order to 
identify the real threats to the security of the Russian 
Federation. The country's leadership expects from you accurate 
assessments of the possible consequences of these threats and 
the best ways to neutralize or eliminate them. 
  It is important that we possess reliable, systematic, and 
unabridged knowledge of the situation inside the Russian 
Federation and around it. We need advance information with 
variant forecasts and appropriate draft proposals on possible 
management or political solutions. 
  I categorically disagree with the view that the information 
and analysis work of the counterintelligence service should be 
performed only on instructions from above. 
  This is a profoundly erroneous stance! On the contrary, we 
need as much initiative as possible. Waiting around for 
instructions is just a nonstate approach. If you like, it is a 
question that touches on the professional honor of the 
counterintelligence service. 
  I would also like to clarify the line of argument that 
the counterintelligence organs stand outside politics. As far 
as individual staffers are concerned, they are certainly not 
allowed to combine their work with political activity, that is 
to say to serve the interests of a particular party or social 
organization. 
  But the Federal Service is a state organ. Its main purpose 
is to execute state policy. This must be clearly understood by 
all staffers and by their leaders in particular. 
  Personnel in state service, wherever they may work, have 
just 
one policy -- that of the state. To be outside this policy is a 
sure sign of professional unsuitability. 
  We want Russia to become a truly strong and effective 
state. We want democratic institutions to develop not just in 
word but in deed. We want guarantees of human rights to be 
strengthened. 
  This is precisely why we will demand that all organs and 
structures of the executive branch accurately follow the 
priorities of state policy. This is our principled line. 
  Your service is called upon to perform primarily 
counterintelligence functions. 
  Whatever changes may occurr in Russia and the world, we are 
still a long way from the day when the counterintelligence 
services will have nothing to do. 
  Unfortunately, there are forces in the world which have set 
themselves the aim to weaken Russia and turn it into a feeble 
competitor with a cheap labor force and low intellectual 
potential. There are those who want to appropriate Russia's 
natural wealth and take possession of our advanced technologies 
in space, military, and other spheres. 
  The main rule is that any action capable of damaging 
national 
interests should be prevented or neutralized. From whatever 
direction it might come. 
  There can be no question of any exceptions. 
  But I would like to emphasize that the efficacy of your work 
is not judged by the number of spies you apprehend. Your task 
is not just to expose but primarily to prevent intelligence 
activities in Russia. 
  Let us not fool ourselves: There is as yet no reliable 
protection in Russia against the gathering of information and 
the establishment of agents networks. The reasons for this are 
loopholes in the laws, our open borders, falling standards in 
discipline, the cost of comercialization, and other factors. 
  The counterintelligence service is aware of all this more 
clearly than anyone else. It is precisely you who are obliged 
to inform the organs of power about this and to persistently 
propose specific solutions from an organizational and legal 
point of view. 
  The collapse of the system of state secrets is causing 
serious alarm. 
  The Law "On State Secrets" came into force in Russia in 
1993. But a new system for the protection of secrets based on it 
has not as yet been created. 
  It is essential to make full use of the powers granted you. 
First and foremost the right to monitor that the demands 
regarding the protection of state secrets are carried out 
precisely. Your assistance in elaborating and implementing 
procedural [rezhimnyy] measures is especially needed by nonstate 
structures. 
  An exceptionally important area of your activities is the 
struggle against illegal infringement of the constitutional 
system. 
  It is no secret to anyone that there are in Russia certain 
parties and movements, as well as public figures and citizens, 
who are banking on this. Illegal methods do not always receive 
the proper rebuff. Part of this problem is down to your 
shortcomings. 
  There is absolutely no justification for blaming this on an 
alleged lack of the necessary legal base for exposing and 
putting a stop to unconstitutional activity. 
  Yes, our legislation is not perfect. But we have enough 
existing legal norms for counterintelligence work to neutralize 
extremist plans. 
  I will make only one amplification on a matter of principle. 
This work should be based not on the monitoring of citizens' 
political conduct and views, but on the exposure, prevention, 
and thwarting of unconstitutional and other illegal activities. 
  This is a most important factor which will make it possible 
to avoid the counterintelligence organs becoming organs of 
political investigation. 
  Interethnic contradictions are one of the basic factors 
causing tension in Russia. 
  The conflicts in Chechnya, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia are 
assuming a protracted nature, and are throwing the country into 
a ferment. 
  Enormous resources are being diverted in order to settle 
them 
and to eliminate the consequences. The intervention of the 
Armed Forces, law enforcement bodies and other departments is 
needed. Innocent people are perishing as the contradictions are 
being resolved. Tens of thousands of people are becoming 
refugees. 
  In these conditions the forecasts for the development of 
events and suggestions of essential measures are extremely 
important. There is patently a lack of efficiency at the present 
time. I am drawing this to the most serious attention not only 
of the leadership of the FCS but also the leaders of the 
territorial organs. The whole arsenal of forces and resources 
of the FCS must be brought into play and new, nonstereotyped 
methods of work must be actively sought. 
  Inaction and irresolution are fraught with the most serious 
consequences. These include a decline in the prestige of the 
authorities both in the center and at local level, and a 
critical reduction of the level of personal security, extremism, 
and chaos for years to come in whole regions. 
  In the face of these dangers sluggishness and unconcern are 
not only impermissible but criminal. 
  The paramount task for Russia today is to surmount the 
economic crisis. Therefore I ask you to pay special attention 
to questions of counterintelligence backup for the protection of 
the Russian economy. 
  At present we are protecting Russian economic interests 
poorly. There is no system or assertiveness in the FCS's actions 
in this area. We must not go on trailing in the wake of events 
and only reacting to them (even then belatedly at times). 
  Of course, ensuring economic security is a statewide task. I 
address this criticism to everyone -- to economic departments, 
above all. The time has come for the government to work out a 
strategy of Russia's economic security. 
  Counterintelligence must act selectively in the economic 
sphere. 
  I am talking, first, of questions to which the answers can 
only be given by the special service and no other state organ. 
  Second, of the most vital state requirements or "sore 
points." 
  Third, everything must be done to ensure that Russia does 
not 
end up "on the sidelines" of the world economy. It is necessary 
to preserve progressive economic, scientific, and technical 
potential and to ensure our export potential. This is a task 
not only for science, industry, and foreign economic 
departments. For this the special services must also make an 
effort. 
  In addition, we must have a detailed picture of the 
preconditions for possible extraordinary occurrences 
(explosions, fires, accidents, disasters, and so on). I can 
state without exaggeration that every major extraordinary 
occurrence now deals a painful blow to Russia's entire economy 
and to the social well-being of citizens. 
  We must have exhaustive knowledge of the threats associated 
with flawed technologies for storing, neutralizing, and 
destroying the waste material from dangerous production 
processes and nuclear and chemical materials and weapons. The 
use of Russia's territory to bury ecologically dangerous 
materials illegally imported from abroad constitutes a special 
question. 
  Active counterintelligence work in this area will not only 
help the state to save considerable funds but will also save 
people's lives. 
  Counterintelligence backup for conversion is one of the 
most important problems. 
  Conversion is a commandment of the times. But we do not 
travel the same road as those to whom conversion and scientific 
and technical regression mean one and the same thing. For us 
these concepts are incompatible. Our task today is to hold on 
to Russia's advanced positions in scientific and technical 
development, and tomorrow to expand them. 
  Russia's defense capability can on no account be allowed to 
be weakened. Secrets of state importance concentrated in this 
sphere cannot be allowed to go abroad. 
  This task cannot be resolved without selfless activity by 
the 
FCS. 
  At the same time counterintelligence must not hamper the 
expansion of international cooperation within the framework of 
interstate agreements and existing legislation. 
  The iron curtain has collapsed! Not just between states but 
also between people. International contacts will develop in the 
ascendant. You must accumulate experience of work in conditions 
of an open society and a market economy. 
  The further we get from total bans, the more professionally 
and delicately counterintelligence must operate. 
  I cannot ignore the question of crime. 
  Smuggling has become widespread in recent years. We are 
incurring tremendous losses as a result of the uncontrolled 
export from the country of raw materials, semimanufactures, and 
objects of art, culture, and our spiritual heritage. Financial 
assets are being taken out of circulation and are settling in 
foreign banks. Frequently the damage is irreparable! 
  Therefore the struggle against these phenomena is one of the 
priorities of the FCS and its organs. 
  Smuggling is associated with other grave crimes -- 
embezzlement, bribery, currency swindles, illegal crossings of 
the state border, and so on. Therefore your efforts here must 
be stepped up constantly. 
  I am talking of exposing all the links of criminal chains, 
of 
tracking down international groups of smugglers and rendering 
them harmless. 
  Close businesslike cooperation will be required between the 
FCS and customs organs, the Federal Border Service, and internal 
affairs organs. 
  Unfortunately, the criminalization of society is continuing. 
Violent crimes by organized groups are acquiring forms of 
criminal terrorism. 
  The growing corruptness of power structures and of law 
enforcement and other state organs is extremely dangerous to the 
state. Particularly in the sphere of the redistribution of 
property. 
  Certain successes have been scored recently in the fight 
against crime. But the results, on the whole, are 
unsatisfactory. Just like the efforts of counterintelligence in 
this sphere. 
  Organized crime is no longer limited to the sphere of 
ordinary criminal activity. It persistently seeks admission to 
big-time politics and access to the administration of the state 
and its regions. This is your problem. 
  The FCS must counter such attempts with all its operational 
and operational-technical potential. In collaboration with the 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the Tax Police, it must 
expose criminal sources of funding for political campaigns, the 
links between statesmen and politicians and the organizers of 
criminal fraternities which seek to get their people into the 
organs of power, and, indeed, which are primed with funds from 
abroad. 
  All the above applies in full measure also to the problems 
of 
the uncontrolled proliferation of firearms and narcotics. 
  The task of the FCS' operational subdivisions is to take 
original, decisive, and at times even bold measures to eradicate 
these phenomena, which are extremely dangerous to society. 
  Only thus can the ongoing situation be influenced for the 
better. I know that counterintelligence officers have always 
been distinguished by a creative, original, and unexpected 
approach to their work. This was and remains the supreme sign 
of professionalism, the object of your legitimate pride. 
  To achieve a breakthrough in the struggle against the most 
dangerous manifestations of crime is a task that is worthy of 
you. 
  But there is also another side to the fulfillment of this 
task. You and you colleagues to this day have to bear a heavy 
load of responsibility for the crimes of past security organs, 
which you did not commit. Above all for the mass repressions of 
Stalinism. 
  Life changes, the state and people change, but the old 
alienation is evaporating too slowly. 
  I think that it is precisely the active participation of the 
FCS in the struggle against crime -- this paramount danger to 
the ordinary citizen -- that will finally close this subject. 
  Achieve a breakthrough in this field, protect Russians 
against crime, and, I am sure, they will thank you. The icy 
wall of fear and mistrust will crumble once and for all. I am 
confident that this is necessary not only to the 
counterintelligence service, but to Russian society as a whole. 
  The FCS contains military counterintelligence subivisions. 
They have special tasks -- to know the situation in the Army, 
to protect it from those who want to get their hands on military 
secrets and facilities. 
  The merits of military counterintelligence officers are 
considerable, but the results of their activity must be 
significantly more substantial. 
  A special word on the proliferation of arms from Army dumps 
throughout the country. Now in Maritime Kray, now in Irkutsk, 
now in other regions, fires are breaking out in munition stores. 
  Where are the advance warnings about violation of the 
conditions of the storage of munitions?! But perhaps the fires 
in the stores are no accident? And another question: From what 
stores are weapons being delivered to "hot" spots? 
  Military counterintelligence must provide the answers. 
  Russia's nuclear security is an extremely important, 
cardinal 
problem. The proliferation of nuclear and other categories of 
weapons of mass destruction within the country and beyond cannot 
be allowed. This is also our international obligation. 
  I expect regular briefings from the counterintelligence 
service on all aspects of this problem. Special attention must 
be paid to anticipating and resolutely thwarting attempts to 
gain unauthorized access to nuclear components. There have been 
no cases of "nuclear terrorism" in Russia, and there must be 
none. 
  The active formation of a state border is now under way in 
Russia. Counterintelligence is a component of the forces and 
resources needed to protect it. 
  It is important that we maintain good-neighhborly relations 
with neighboring states. At the same time we are doing 
everything necessary to increase the security level of the 
borders and Russia's exclusive economic zone. 
  We know that the situation on the Russian border is not 
peaceful at the moment. And there is vast scope for activity 
for you here. 
  In the near future we will discuss questions of guarding our 
country's borders in the Security Council. I have no doubt that 
S.V. Stepashin, who is a permanent member of the council, will 
report what the FCS sees as the solution to border problems. 
  I am well aware that tackling the complex tasks facing your 
service will make special demands on the people working here. 
  A counterintelligence officer's work requires great 
resilience, the ability to think in an innovative way and to 
operate using initiative within tight time constraints, and 
under a great mental and physical load. 
  This is why, in setting up the FCS and carrying out the 
professional certification [of personnel], I demanded a careful 
and attentive approach toward every staffer. 
  A professional counterintelligence officer, especially a 
leader, is formed over many years. We cannot allow ourselves to 
take an irresponsible attitude toward any of you. All cases of 
superficial certification must be investigated very carefully. 
Worthy, committed, and energetic staffers must be brought into 
play in the work. 
  Will the FCS be further reformed? This question is 
constantly asked by your colleagues. This is the answer: Yes, 
it will. But it is not a question of any new, radical shakeup 
but of changes which will take time. 
  There is no country in the world in which a constant 
improvement of special services is not takiong place. Your 
department is no exception. There is one aim -- to increase the 
effectiveness of counterintelligence. 
  When we embarked on breaking up the KGB, for political 
motives among other things, we by no means denied -- and do not 
deny -- the need for fairly reliable and close coordination of 
the work of the various former parts of it which have been 
divided into autonomous structures, as well as of the Armed 
Forces General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate [GRU]. We 
are thinking about what kind of collaboration mechanism there 
should be. Mainly it must obviously rely on bilateral relations 
and on forming operational groups to tackle certain tasks of one 
kind or another which include representatives of various special 
services. 
  I have carefully considered the results of the meeting of 
your collegium together with the FIS directorate [direktorat] 
and have concluded that in this respect you are on the right 
road. 
  In this auditorium I cannot fail to talk about the specific 
characteristics of local FCS organs. 
  We take as our basis the principle that there cannot be a 
"Nizhniy Novgorod" or a "Maritime Kray" counterintelligence 
service. We have one counterintelligence service -- Russian 
counterintelligence, organized in a strict hierarchy, 
independent of local authorities. Under the constitution it is 
subordinate to the Russian president. 
  This status does not preclude but presupposes close 
cooperation and mutual assistance between FCS subdivisions and 
the executive organs of republics, krays, and oblasts. 
  Let me stress that priorities have been set. No distortions 
in ensuring regional security to the detriment of federal 
security are permissible. Otherwise both people unaware of what 
state security is and the FCS director will be held responsible. 
  Very serious attention must be devoted to questions 
regarding 
the training of a new generation of counterintelligence officers. 
  Today a counterintelligence potential is being developed 
which will give a return in five to 10 years. Programs for 
training and retraining personnel must be carefully reviewed. 
Prompt changes must be made in them in the light of the 
development of the legal and normative base and the 
clarification of priorities for the FCS' activity. You have 
everything necessary for this. 
  I will also say a few words about the role of leaders. The 
indispensable requirements with regard to them are a high degree 
of professionalism, competency, responsibility, loyalty to the 
motherland, honesty and integrity, and the ability to make the 
collective follow their lead. Putting it in military terms, a 
leader must be prepared to give the command "Do as I do," and 
carry it out better than his subordinates. 
  These are the kind of leaders and operatives we will support 
and create the necessary conditions for. But above all we will 
demand fruitful work. 
  In talking about FCS personnel I cannot bypass the problem 
of 
their probity and incorruptibility. Everything must be done to 
ensure that the best traditions here are not only maintained but 
also strengthened. As regards this question the position of all 
leaders and personnel apparatuses must be a principled one. 
  It has been reported to me that there are differences in the 
level of social protection for staffers of various special 
services and law-enforcement organs. And not in favor of FCS 
staffers. 
  I will say frankly that I am against "leveling." But if it 
is a question of substantial distortions in the wages of 
different departments, we will rectify it. 
  Your calling and your professional duty is to ensure the 
security of the individual, society, and the state. The main 
conditions for this are well known to all: Civil peace in 
Russia must be maintained and strengthened, revolutionary 
upheavals must be prevented, and the profound economic crisis 
must be overcome. 
  We will be able to achieve this by consolidating our Russian 
state in action. The Russian Federal Counterintelligence 
Service is one of its important, inalienable institutions. Your 
service must be strong and have a flexible structure. Its 
extensive possibilities must be effectively used in the defense 
of Russians both in the country and abroad, in the defense of 
Russian interests against the aspirations of foreign 
intelligence services and other criminal encroachments. 
  Therefore I firmly recommend -- get rid of achronisms. 
Therefore I demand: Act energetically, boldly, and 
decisively. 
  I sincerely wish you success in your work, which is 
difficult 
and dangerous, but vitally necessary to Russia.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Sergey 
Shakhray will not run for president in 1996, according to his 
statement at today's meeting with students and professors of 
Moscow University. 
  Speaking of his resignation from the post of minister for 
affairs of nationalities and the voiced intention to leave the 
vice-premier's post, Shakhray said "the question has been 
closed, I remain the vice-premier". He told the audience that 
meetings with the prime minister and president assured him "his 
potential has not been exhausted". 
  Shakhray did not exclude "the right to future existence of 
Far Eastern or Urals republics on condition it will not be a 
mere isolation of the region or the territory within the current 
administrative borders". In his opinion, this is possible "in 
case of formation of larger federation subjects on the basis of 
inter-regional economic unity and cooperation". 
  Commenting on press reports claiming fake results of the 
December 12 referendum on the new Russian Constitution, the 
vice-premier said "as long as these claims are not proved, I 
will think that the Constitution has been approved". The 
Constitution is a reality, said Shakhray.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamyshev report: "Regional Policy in New </F>
Conditions. Regions Combat Moscow and Bad Weather"] 
  [Text] The changing weather of May meant continuous 
troubles for the organizers of the "Federalism And Interethnic 
Relations in Modern Russia" conference that ended in the "Forest 
Vistas" [Lesnyye Dali] guest house near Moscow Saturday. First, 
owing to the sudden spell of cool weather and other state 
affairs, Ivan Rybkin and Sergey Filatov could not make it to the 
conference. Second, the participants in the conference, whom the 
inclement weather drove under the roof of the main building of 
the guest house, started to show marked boredom by the end of 
the first day and started to slip away. 
  Even despite the absence of the heads of the State Duma and 
the President's Staff, however, it was full house during the 
first plenary sitting, with Sergey Shakhray, who had not been 
permitted to quit [as vice premier] the day before, appearing on 
the panel apparently as an attraction. The vice premier, who 
presented a paper [doklad] on the problems of federalism in 
Russia, expressed the conviction that the main problem is a 
contradiction between the ethnic and territorial principle of 
the state's construction (the "asymmetrical" nature of the 
federation), and he once again lauded the treaty with Tataria 
[Tatarstan] whose model, in Shakhray's words, is quite 
applicable in Crimea, the Dniester Region, and Karabakh. The 
vice premier also complained that market relations in conditions 
of weakness of federal authorities increase regional 
disproportions, and declared for regulation of prices of energy 
and shipping by rail. 
  Shakhray's speech provided the point of departure for the 
conference participants, who had come, according to its 
organizers, from 66 federation components. Remarkably, the 
number of critics of the "May Theses" [Shakhray's keynote 
address, paralleled with Lenin's "April Theses"] was greater 
than of those who went along with them. For example, Ramazan 
Abdulatipov, Federation Council vice speaker, deemed the signing 
of separate agreements with federation components to be 
incorrect, while delegates from the republics did not like the 
idea of a gradual transition to a territorial structure of the 
federation. 
  Despite the cool weather outside the window, especially 
heated debates flared up during the second day of work at the 
sittings of the sections and "roundtables." In the course of 
the discussion the participants divided in two big distinct 
groups: representatives of the republics, who demolished the 
new Constitution, which should never have been passed in a 
referendum, and those who were demanding that the Federation 
Treaty be religiously observed and suggested that separate 
agreements be signed with all who would like to sign them. 
Delegates of the krays and oblasts (supported by Moscow 
politicians and academics) tried to persuade the "republicans" 
not to hurt ethnic Russians, to give up the idea of sovereignty 
and remake their constitutions as Moscow is asking for. At the 
end, everyone remained of the same opinion, agreeing only that 
the State Duma, 40 percent of whose members are Muscovites, 
cannot reflect the regions' interests adequately.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Difficulty": </F>
"Subsistence Wage To Match Consumer Basket"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Osovtsov, deputy chairman of the State 
Duma Labor and Social Support Committee, and committee member 
Valentin Lednev, both associated with "Russia's Choice," spoke 
at a news conference about the faction's activities in making 
laws pertaining to the social sphere. At their prompting, the 
Duma Council has decided to include in the plan of immediate 
legislation laws on the subsistence wage and on veterans, which 
were elaborated with the active participation of "Russia's 
Choice." The portfolio of the faction and the committee also 
contains a program to combat poverty, draft laws on social 
services, on social protection for the disabled, and on ritual 
support (a euphemism for burial services). Thus, the organizers 
of the news conference underlined, "Russia's Choice" is as good 
as its pledge to the voters. 
  The faction's approach to social policy is special in that 
it 
is trying to find a common denominator of social payments. For 
example, there are now 54 decrees in effect on provision of 
benefits to veterans. Some normative acts, however, treat all 
alike. Mr. Osovtsov cited the example of Robert Kennedy, a 
father of nine, who would have been legally eligible for the 
"multiple children benefit." There is an equal mess about 
housing, and so on. "Our objective is not to endlessly discuss 
the issue but to give at least a spoonful to each who are 
hungry," Mr. Osovtsev underlined. 
  Such a common denominator should apply to the subsistence 
wage. The law on it relies on federal budget appropriations to 
the tune of 2.6 trillion rubles (for benefits to the needy) and 
is supposed to go into effect as of 1 January 1995. The draft 
law provides for a dual principle of counting: The subsistence 
wage level to be established in every federation component is 40 
percent of the average per capita income but not less than the 
cost of the consumer basket. 
  The same dual macro-approach of the "Choice" applies to 
social policy. On the one hand, Mr. Gaydar constantly reminds 
about the need to cut back centralized subsidies, while on the 
other hand, "Russia's Choice" men seem to be dealing the budget 
a serious blow promising protection for the underprivileged. 
The organizers of the news conference specially underscored 
that this is a seeming contradiction because the men's 
activities in drafting laws in the social sphere do not set the 
aim of the "each will get an apartment" type -- this is 
demagoguery. Their efforts are aimed at a just distribution of 
state assistance so that "a one-room family with two children, 
two domestic servants and two Volvo cars could buy an apartment 
rather than wait for municipal housing." 
  A smart plan. Unfortunately, such social policy leads to the 
need to withdraw benefits from those who undeservedly enjoy them 
-- like the above-mentioned family or that same family of Robert 
Kennedy -- and it is common knowledge that we like to get 
benefits and hate to give them back. On the other hand, voters 
who enjoy "dishonest" benefits may not make up Mr. Gaydar's 
electorate after all. At any rate, the journalists were made to 
understand that unpopular measures are not something he has to 
come to terms with.

<F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report in the "Genesis" column: "The </F>
Gaydar Party Is Preparing an `Economic Miracle.' Russia's 
Choice Will Have Many Platforms"] 
  [Text] Last Saturday 363 delegates to the Moscow city 
founding conference of the Russia's Choice party unanimously 
recognized that confrontation among the democrats in the present 
situation, "balm to the national-communists," is "dangerous." 
Noting the vital need for democratic unity, the delegates 
concentrated their attention on drafting party rules and a 
program whose implementation they linked directly to their own 
"advent to power." 
  Yegor Gaydar made a policy speech. Making a brief digression 
into his premiership, the leader of the faction and the future 
party identified a "fundamental mistake" by his team, which in 
its time gave way to demands from the nomenklatura which 
"subjected it to pressure unprecedented in Russia's history," 
allowing it to restore various "committees and subcommittees." 
Yegor Gaydar sees the natural results of that compromise in 
"the runaway swelling of an overwhelming bureaucratic apparatus" 
and "the interruption of the economic reform in mid-course" by 
the same apparatus. 
  The possibilities that have opened up for the people to 
choose and buy any goods and freely change rubles into dollars, 
according to Mr. Gaydar, "are not yet the market," which will 
really be possible "on the basis of economic growth." The main 
obstacle to growth is the existing "huge corrupt state machine," 
toward reforming which the party founder is directing his 
colleagues' efforts. 
  Assessing the chances for the democrats' success, Yegor 
Gaydar told the delegates, "in the regions as well as in the 
central apparatus people who in no way share our thinking have 
taken over all the key posts.... The threat of hardline 
conservatism and reactionary backlash is great." Under these 
conditions, in Gaydar's opinion, the democrats need not 
"amorphous organizations, like in the period of struggling 
against the sclerotic regime," but effective parties. 
  Party effectiveness was demonstrated by Yuliy Nisnevish: 
Having conducted the conference in rigid compliance with the 
approved schedule and procedures specified by the minute, he 
skillfully dampened emerging disagreements between city and 
district organizing committees over procedures for nominating 
delegates to the constituent congress. In the lobbies this fact 
was assessed as a precursor to "intraparty discord in the 
future." With respect to other issues Russia's Choice members 
had no more complaints to make against each other, approving the 
party's economic course aimed at "a Russian economic miracle 
through domestic economic growth," and a political course aimed 
at "stimulating growth points," and in the very near term, 
"coming to power." 
  After making more than 140 amendments to the program, 
approximately 400 amendments and 19 basic comments to the rules, 
the delegates agreed that their party will be of a parliamentary 
type with an individual fixed membership, an orientation towards 
entrepreneurs and the intelligentsia, and allowing various 
intraparty platforms. The delegates decided that party members 
have no need for weapons. The word "Mister" [Gospodin] has been 
adopted as the party form of address. With time, a youth 
organization will be formed within the party. On the subject of 
upcoming presidential elections the conference decided that it 
would be reasonable for all democrats to unite in a single bloc 
and field one candidate.

  [Text] Yegor Gaydar, leader of the Russia's Choice faction 
in the State Duma, declared that "under the obvious offensive of 
conservative and reactionary forces" the Russia's Choice party 
faces the goal "to defend the democratic alternative in Russia." 
  Addressing the constituent conference of the party's Moscow 
organization on Saturday, Gaydar expressed his opinion saying 
that "the organizational weakness and crumbliness of the 
democratic movement represent a serious threat for Russia's 
future." The new party of a parliamentarian type which is being 
created on the initiative of the Russia's Choice faction is 
intended "to unite those who share the valuables of the market, 
democracy, and private ownership." 
  As Gaydar said, the implementation of the party's program 
"will assist in stabilization of the situation in the country 
and its growth." 
  In Gaydar's opinion, Russia is experiencing "an inevitable 
wave of reaction with respect to the deep transformations 
underway in the country now" but "not the beginning of an 
irreversible turn backwards." He believes that "this wave will 
go away" because "the communists and their allies, the radical 
nationalists, have no notion what to offer to the society" but 
the "unpopular program" which "was already implemented in Russia 
some time ago."

Detailed Reply by the LDPR to Mr. Svanidze. Zhirinovskiy 
Faction's Innovations Run Up Against `Russia's Choice'"] 
  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democrats, outraged 
by television journalist Nikolay Svanidze's statements that the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] has not submitted a 
single draft to the Duma, told the public about their lawmaking 
activities and their economic research efforts. 
  LDPR deputies explained that all of their innovations run up 
against "Russia's Choice" opposition in the Duma Council and at 
plenary sittings. For this reason the draft laws "On Regulation 
of Ownership in the Russian Federation," "On Russian Federation 
Property Abroad," "On Trust," "On the Restoration of Property 
Rights of Russian Federation Citizens Violated in the Period 17 
March 1917 through 12 December 1993," and "On the Brain Drain 
From the Russian Federation" have not become full-fledged state 
acts after all. 
  The journalists' close attention was drawn to the first 
three 
draft laws. The law "On Trust" was drafted by Deputy Aleksey 
Zuyev, who, before his election, was adviser to the president of 
the "GMM" trust company, whose activities drew complaints from 
the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. The other two laws 
are devoted to the implementation of the party's economic 
program. The one regulating the rights of ownership puts an end 
to the voucher privatization that is nearly completed anyhow. 
Instead of this robbery, all citizens of the Russian Federation 
are supposed to open Savings Bank accounts marked "NP" (National 
Property), "PP" (Privatized Property), and the "RNP" (Regional 
National Property). The various owners -- the state, the 
regions, and private owners who have snapped up their share of 
the generous LDPR handouts -- are supposed to put their earnings 
in these accounts. It has been decided to name this process 
privatization. That, the Liberal Democratic innovators have 
calculated, would make for a comfortable life for 60 percent of 
Russia's citizens. 
  It is even easier with investments in industry -- one only 
has to mortgage all Russian Federation property abroad in 
Japanese banks, to pour all the earned yen into the needy 
enterprises, to ban without fail liberalization of external 
trade, to stir the concoction and have Mr. Zhirinovskiy and his 
economic advisers drink it up with a feeling of deep gratitude. 
A sudden drain of healthy brains, if the program gets 
implemented, can be prevented by the corresponding law drafted 
in the committee on geopolitics.

  [Text] Leader of Russia's Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy stated in Moscow on Monday that "sooner or later 
historical justice will triumph and the Vilnius territory which 
was always part of Russia, would be re-joined to Russia and the 
Kaliningrad Region will cease to be isolated from us." 
  He told the press conference devoted to a State Duma 
delegation's visit to Russia's Baltic exclave, located between 
Lithuania and Poland, that "Kaliningrad is an inalienable part 
of Russia and that neither Lithuanians, nor Estonians, nor Poles 
or Germans, will be able to tear it away from the motherland." 
  The Kaliningrad Region (former East Prussia) was joined to 
Russia following the Potsdam conference in 1945. The Vilnius 
territory is the south eastern part of Lithuania which was 
occupied by Poland in 1919-39. In 1939, following the 
occupation of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union sent its 
troops to this territory and subsequently joined it to Lithuania.

  [Text] The closest political goal of the opposition 
consists in the establishment of a single popular movement which 
would gain the majority of seats in the Russian parliament 
during the next parliamentary elections and thereafter win the 
presidential elections, former Russian vice president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy stated in an interview with Interfax today. 
  The Accord for Russia opposition movement will hold a 
meeting 
of its National Council in Moscow on Saturday. 
  Rutskoy stressed that the opposition should be careful not 
to 
let one more candidate from the present regime to take the 
highest post. That is why the opposition needs a single 
candidate. 
  Rutskoy said that each of the party leaders believed that he 
must be elected the president. Rutskoy himself said that he 
does not especially seek the presidency and that any candidacy 
should be put forward taking into consideration the interests of 
the cause. 
  Rutskoy suggested that a tough politician must take this 
post 
since the present situation in the country required rule with no 
compromise, consensus or games with the law. 
  Rutskoy said nothing would be changed in the country as long 
as Boris Yeltsin remained in power. Neither a government of 
national confidence, nor a new composition of the parliament 
will change the situation. It must go through radical changes, 
Rutskoy affirmed. 
  Rutskoy said he was ready to lead the united opposition.

<F P=106> [Arkadiy Nikiforov report under the "Authority" rubric: </F>
"Boris Yeltsin Gives Yuriy Skokov New Carte Blanche. Commodity 
Producers Federation Chairman Strengthens His Position at State 
Duma"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation of Commodity Producers 
[RFCP] and the State Duma's second largest faction, the New 
Regional Policy, represented by their leaders, Yuriy Skokov and 
Vladimir Medvedev respectively, have signed an agreement on a 
wide-ranging coordination of their efforts in devising common 
approaches to political and economic areas, defining the main 
areas of legislative activity, and joint work on resolving 
urgent problems at the federal and regional level. 
  Before the agreement was signed, Skokov and Medvedev had 
lengthy meetings and conversations with Boris Yeltsin, who, 
according to available reports, approved of this far-reaching 
alliance. 
  It is worth noting that neither the RFCP nor the New 
Regional 
Policy Faction have signed the Treaty on Social Accord in the 
belief that without resolving the most acute economic and social 
problems it will end up being yet another declaration of good 
intentions. 
  Yuriy Skokov, who is a serious candidate for top government 
posts, is clearly strengthening his position and acquiring new 
opportunities to influence the State Duma and the regions. The 
formalization of this alliance will be undoubtedly a shot in the 
arm for Vladimir Medvedev himself and his faction at the State 
Duma, which can now rely on direct support from one of Russia's 
most promising and experienced politicians. 
  In that regard, a question arises as to whether Sergey 
Shakhray's removal from the post of minister for nationalities 
and regional policy was prompted by the carte blanche Yuriy 
Skokov apparently received from the Russian president to pursue 
a new political line toward the federation components. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the RFCP chief's flurry of 
activity also stems from the president's harsh criticism of the 
government's performance and the signing of a package of edicts 
aimed at stabilizing the economy and streamlining 
market-oriented reform. In that context, the following question 
will be only logical: What will happen after the Chernomyrdin 
government is yet again unable to enforce President Yeltsin's 
strict instructions and to hold up the avalanche-like production 
slump? The situation will apparently require that a new prime 
minister be appointed who must have not only the experience of a 
large-scale economic manager, but also a serious, thought-out, 
and, most important, realistic program of lifting the Russian 
economy out of its deepest crisis.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- The Russian State Duma has 
proved to be adherent to the former Supreme Soviet's traditions, 
Chairman of the All-Russian TV and Radio Company Oleg Poptsov 
told ITAR-TASS here today, commenting on the Duma decision to 
form its own TV and radio service. 
  In his opinion, the Duma "claims on certain information 
exclusiveness", which may provoke a chain reaction on the part 
of other power structures, including the juridical one. "Then 
we will have a splendid TV and the radio," said Poptsov. 
  Lamenting there were no deputies to show wisdom and 
understanding, Poptsov stressed "the main feature of democracy 
is openness, modesty and availability of power bodies, their 
ability of self-estimation, and not claims on privileges".

  [Text] The Russian Union of Journalists, the Committee for 
Defending the Freedom of Speech and Journalists' Rights, and the 
Fund for the Protection of Glasnost have made a statement today. 
They regard the recreation of a parliamentary TV service as an 
attempt to make it impossible for the electorate to form an 
objective opinion of deputies' activities. The same tendency 
can be observed in the attempts by other authorities to bend the 
media to their will and make them a mouthpiece of their 
time-serving interests. It is inadmissible that the 
broadcasting time belonging to the whole society should be split 
into departmental domains, or even worse, be monopolized, the 
statement of the journalists' unions stresses.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The Russian Press Committee 
warned the ZAVTRA newspaper on Tuesday that some of its 
materials are incompatible with operating legislation. 
  Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS later in the day that "the warning was 
prompted, in part, by the article `World Villainy' containing 
downright propaganda of war and violence". 
  He said that an application was filed with the Russian 
prosecutor-general's office on instituting an investigation 
against the newspaper. 
  The committee also sent warnings to St. Petersburg-based ZA 
RUSSKOYE DELO and RODNYE PROSTOPY newspapers about their 
violations of the mass media law. Some of their articles 
contained calls for overthrowing the present constitutional 
system by force as well as ideas of racial strife and 
anti-semitism. 
  The committee intends to review, in the near future, a 
decision by the former Press and Information Ministry on the 
registration of the AL-KODS newspaper, which was done with a 
violation of the mass media law: a foreign subject acted as the 
publication's founder. 
  Gryzunov also said that he started receiving telephone 
threats from the so-called Russian patriots.

  [Text] Moscow, 30 May, (BIZNESS-TASS) -- "The possibility 
of a change in the macroeconomic situation in Russia is 
emerging," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today 
in the Russian Federation Government at a meeting of heads of 
administrations. The Constitution itself and a package of 
presidential economic decrees signed last week are the 
legislative preconditions for that. 
  "The crisis has reached its peak", V. Chernomyrdin pointed 
out. Ensuring that the economic situation finally goes in the 
direction of getting better, that is, implementing the reforms 
in the production sphere is what should become the task for the 
government in 1995-1997. But the basis for this has already 
been prepared. This is shown by the figures of the dynamics in 
the rise of production, and the stabilization of the ruble (in 
particular, the steady fall of the inflation rate and a 
reduction in the Central Bank's refinancing interest rates), the 
prime minister said. 
  According to V. Chernomyrdin, the Russian regions have 
always 
been the moving force behind the reforms. That is why today's 
meeting with the heads of administrations was devoted to 
examining such issues as designing measures for the final stage 
of the vouchers' privatization process, discussing the program 
for the privatization of state and municipal enterprises after 1 
July 1994 and the examination of the new Russian Federation Land 
Code. As is known, the heads of oblast and kray administrations 
took part in drawing up these documents together with experts 
from ministries and departments.

  [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has given instructions to 
develop 11 important social and economic programs. In addition 
the government is preparing some 20 programs to resolve several 
key problems in industry. This was reported to Interfax by the 
head of the presidential staff Sergey Filatov. 
  According to him, presidential programs concern primarily 
health and environmental protection. The medical industry must 
be promoted, in particular the production of insulin and protein 
for the food industry. Another program provides for the 
transition to energy-consuming technologies in different 
branches of the economy, including the auto industry. 
  Filatov stressed that the implementation of this important 
program will give a new impetus to Russian engineering. He said 
things have gone to a point when Russian vehicles are not 
permitted to Europe because they do not meet international 
environmental safety norms. 
  Filatov also hopes that the planned reduction of the 
consumption of gasoline and gas will considerably improve 
transport energy supplies. 
  A public telephone program, Filatov said, will help 
radically 
improve communications in rural areas as well as cities. Some 
of the new programs provide for the development of natural 
resources, in particular new deposits in Tyumen and the Barents 
sea, the expansion of the transport network and others.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The recent package of 
presidential economic decrees was caused by the government's 
inability to achieve the quick adoption of economic bills at the 
State Duma, Russian Vice-Premier and Minister of Economy 
Aleksandr Shokhin told a news conference here today. 
  The government had to ask the president to approve measures 
necessary for further economic reforms by his decrees, said 
Shokhin. 
  "We plan to use presidential decrees and government 
resolutions for swift reaction to Russian economic processes," 
stressed the vice-premier. "Another package of presidential 
decrees will soon be signed". The package will include the 
prepared draft presidential decrees on sales of 
enterprises-debtors and regulation of the consumption fund of 
enterprises, as well as the decrees under elaboration on legal 
basis of foreign economic activities (to eliminate personal 
benefits in this sphere) and regulation of banking activities. 
  The president is ready for joint and quick solution of major 
economic problems, stressed Shokhin.

  [Text] The Russian Federation's Acting Finance Minister 
Sergey Dubinin described the latest economic edicts issued by 
the Russian president as a timely step aimed at establishing 
order in the financial sphere. He said these edicts were 
drafted by the Finance Ministry in conjunction with other 
bodies, including the Russian Central Bank, the State Tax 
Service, and the Economics Ministry. 
  Sergey Dubinin believes that the presidential decrees will 
help solve a whole range of problems to do with the revenue part 
of the state budget, in particular through the better collection 
of taxes. Implementation of these documents will make it 
possible to step up, at least in part, the solution of the 
problem of nonpayments. In addition, the edicts are targeted at 
improving financial discipline in general.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "So This Is the Agreement"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Government has unilaterally prepared a 
number of draft documents designed to resolve urgent social and 
economic problems. 
  "It has thereby violated the basic principles of social 
partnership," Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Federation of 
Independent Trade Unions of Russia [FITUR], believes. 
  At the same time the leader of Russia's trade unions 
mentioned the decree "On Measures To Ensure Employment for the 
Population in the Event of Crisis Situations in the Labor Market 
in Various Regions of the Russian Federation," the proposed 
measures to freeze wages, and so forth; these have not been 
published anywhere, but they have nevertheless been cited in a 
number of mass media and speeches by officials, including Labor 
Minister Gennadiy Melikyan. 
  Shmakov stressed that both the trilateral general agreement 
between the government, employers, and trade unions and the 
Treaty on Social Accord envisage preliminary discussions and 
coordination with trade unions regarding any legislation that 
affects social and economic issues. 
  This was why the trilateral commission on regulating social 
and labor relations was established. But this, according to M. 
Shmakov, has been standing idle recently. Attempts by 
representatives of trade unions and employers to familiarize 
themselves with the drafts of these documents have proved 
unsuccessful. 
  The FITUR leadership believes that the predictions made by 
opponents of signing the Treaty on Social Accord are being borne 
out; they warned that "the government will take no account of 
the `signatories'." 
  In conclusion, M. Shmakov stated that, in the situation as 
it 
stands, any discussion by trade unions of documents of a 
socioeconomic orientation will only be possible once the 
government has met the following conditions: An increase in the 
minimum wage to 40,000 rubles and provision of state guarantees 
that the Law on the Indexation of the Minimum Wage will be 
implemented.

<F P=106> [Vadim Bardin report under the "Finance Ministry Assesses </F>
Presidential Edicts" rubric: "Financiers Sign Up for the 
Opposition"] 
  [Text] The six presidential edicts that supplied Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with the opportunity to announce the birth of a 
Russian economic model remain in the focus of universal 
attention. The State Duma has taken a failed attempt to 
pronounce them unconstitutional from the outset. Russian 
Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said that "many 
provisions of the edicts run counter to the current legislation, 
and some of them are simply astonishing." The Finance Ministry, 
while refraining from issuing any statements, yesterday 
presented its calculations to the State Duma showing that the 
room for tax maneuver is not so large as the edicts' authors 
thought. 
  The essence of the package of presidential edicts, as 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY reported Wednesday, boils down to budget 
maneuvering with the view to easing tax pressure on enterprises, 
a measure which, according to the drafters, must finally bring 
about economic recovery. Naturally, at a time of a budget 
deficit taxes can be cut only if the resulting decrease in the 
budget revenues is offset by something else. This is the reason 
why the edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export 
Deliveries of Goods and Services" should not only liberalize a 
certain sector of the economy, but also give a boost to the 
federal budget's hard-currency revenues. The lifting of tariff 
benefits serves to achieve this objective. It is the abolition 
of benefits together with the tightening of tax and payment 
discipline (to which other edicts in the May package are 
devoted) that should help painlessly to cut taxes. 
  In a letter to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the State Duma 
Committee on the Budget, Finances, and Banks, the Finance 
Ministry has dissipated these hopes. The ministry is proceeding 
from the assumption that hard-currency losses from scrapping 
state quotas on oil, oil products, non-ferrous metals, and 
natural gas, estimated in the draft federal budget at $2.6 
billion, will not be offset by the expected earnings from export 
customs duties ($2.47 billion). At the same time, the ministry 
has already taken into account the new export duty rates that 
have been significantly reduced under the upcoming draft 
government decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 21 May). So, the 
budget will not benefit from that in real terms. 
  (Customs duties have not been levied on exports to meet 
state 
requirements, but virtually all hard-currency earnings have been 
transferred to the budget. According to the logic of the 
edicts' authors, the abolition of state quotas and customs duty 
benefits is designed to replace budget revenues from state 
exports with earnings from export customs duties.) 
  The Finance Ministry's general conclusion is clear: the 
edict "On Lifting Quotas and Licenses for the Export Deliveries 
of Goods and Services" will not help increase the budget 
revenues. Hence, what is left at the government's disposal is 
in effect only administrative measures to combat persistent tax 
evaders. This does not inspire any particular confidence, 
however, that the promises to slash profit and added-value tax 
rates by 10 to 20 percentage points will be fulfilled. 
<H5>  Federal budget hard-currency export revenues in 1994 </H5>
  As of 1 May, $738 million has been received. 
  Revenues according to the draft federal budget 
  -- total -- $2.6 billion 
  -- from oil, oil products, and non-ferrous metals exports 
-- $1.4 billion 
  -- from natural gas exports -- $1.2 billion 
  Revenues after changes introduced by the presidential edicts 
(Finance Ministry's estimate) -- $2.47 billion

  [Text] Head of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee 
Sergey Glazyev has accused the Russian government of losing 
control and of inefficiency. 
  At a news conference in Moscow on Monday, he said the 
economic situation was worse than predicted by the president's 
market research and forecast center earlier this year. Glazyev 
described as catastrophic the situation in research-intensive 
sectors and in the chemical, light and farm equipment 
manufacturing industries where the fall in production, he said, 
would run at 70-90 percent by the end of this year. 
  Although he described Yeltsin's package of economic decrees 
as "a rather serious step" to try to implement the president's 
own policy outlined in a message to the Federal Assembly, 
Glazyev said the reforms could not be shoved on by decrees alone 
amid government passivity and inaction. In his view, some of 
the decrees are not thought-out well enough, not to mention the 
lack of a mechanism for implementing them. 
  Glazyev accused the government of procrastination in 
drafting 
a Yeltsin-promised package of 50 economic bills. 
  The parliamentary official unveiled his own program of 
economic policy guidelines. Among other things, these provide 
for a 10-12 percent value added tax, 20 percent tax on the 
export of capital, 3 percent tax on securities and property 
deals, increasing the range of products falling under excise 
duties, phasing out export tariffs and introduction of an 
environmental tax. 
  On foreign trade, the program envisages improved export and 
currency regulations by the registration of exports of strategic 
commodities and commercial bank representatives as well as the 
return to a state monopoly on oil and gas exports, precious 
metals and stones. 
  It also proposes to kick-start the mechanism of tenders for 
foreign credits as a way of creating an effective economic 
security system.

Economic Situation"] 
  [Text] Speaking in his yesterday's press conference, 
Sergey Glazyev, Duma Economic Policy Committee chairman, stated 
that his own prognoses and those of his colleagues made in March 
have been confirmed by the findings of the Economic Conditions 
Center under the Russian Federation Government: The production 
slump in 1994 will be around 25 percent, that is to say, it will 
become "precipitous." Besides, "there are no special signs of 
recovery in sight that could indicate that this is a turning 
point," Mr. Glazyev stressed. He presented "State's Economic 
Policy Guidelines" developed by a group of economists. Their 
main idea is to bring order into all the sectors of the economy 
and in the system of its control, for which purpose specific 
measures are proposed. Remarkably, in the expression of Mr. 
Glazyev himself, measures which can indeed be implemented have 
been specially selected from a multitude of suggestions.

<F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report from the "Innovations" column: </F>
"Sergey Filatov: The Government Is Moving From Lobbying to 
Comprehension. It Is Proposed To Share Out the Burden of 
Economic Crisis Equally Among Everybody"] 
  [Text] Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov spent 
the past weekend with Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Directorate 
for Liaison with the Territories, in Penza where they inspected 
a cantonment and met with district administration chiefs and 
deputies of the oblast legislative assembly. In the established 
tradition of first acquainting the Russian heartland with 
pending changes in economic policy, Sergey Filatov told those 
present that in June 1994 the annual credit rate in Russia will 
be reduced to 180 percent. According to him, "the process of 
reducing the credit rate will continue also in the future," and 
in the end the notion of easy credits will be excluded from 
Russian economics while the banking system "will enter a 
civilized path." 
  Today, Mr. Filatov said, more material assets, especially 
foreign exchange, are being taken out of Russian than brought 
into it from abroad. Whereas the Russian economy needs $10-12 
billion to "revive," we have only $2-2.5 billion, Mr. Filatov 
stated, and therefore the country's leadership is drafting 
measures to ensure that the hard currency returns to Russia. In 
his opinion, the Russian tax system is ineffective: An increase 
in tax collection by a mere 20 percent will make it possible to 
cut the planned budget deficit by 73 billion rubles. Mr. 
Filatov described the process of closing down loss-making state 
enterprises as "normal and natural." He identified two lines for 
reforming the state sector in industry: "reorganization of the 
state enterprise management system which will make it possible 
to put things in order and create a barrier to abuses by the 
body of directors using enterprise funds for their own personal 
aims, and also provision of state assistance to enterprises 
which have found a niche in the market economy." In the near 
future, Mr. Filatov said, offering a revealing glimpse of 
government, industrial enterprises will be exempted from the 
requirement to maintain social programs. In time, social 
amenities will be transferred to the jurisdiction of local 
self-government and will be financed from budget funds. 
  According to the presidential chief of staff, it is 
necessary 
to share out "the burden of the present economic crisis" equally 
among all strata of Russian society. "Last year the gap between 
the rich and the poor was three- to four-fold but now it has 
grown to 14- fold," he said. At the same time in developed 
countries this indicator does not exceed five. "The social 
differentiation currently observed in Russia," Sergey Filatov 
stressed, "is fraught with instability because our people are 
particularly sensitive to injustice." He did not however 
specify how it is planned to apportion this burden "in equal 
shares." 
  According to Mr. Filatov, the Russian leadership is moving 
from the policy of lobbying to the policy of comprehensive 
economic reforms. One such measure will be cutting sectoral 
subsidies and privileges because such investments are becoming 
"a drug just for one day." "In the future," Mr. Filatov 
stressed, "investments will be made in promising projects and 
efficient enterprises." The presidential apparatus is drafting 
a package of state targeted programs: In the very near future 
the following programs will be submitted to the president: 
Russia's Natural Resources (on mineral deposits); National 
Information Networks; Russia's Health (on supplying the 
country's population with medicines); Development of Power 
Engineering and Alternative Energy Sources; Energy Saving 
Resources; Public Telephone (this program envisions a 
substantial increase in telephone networks for the public); 
Protein and the Food Industry; Ecology; and Cadres and Education 
of the Future. 
  Sergey Filatov is already thinking about future cadres, 
especially those who will be taking part in the 1996 election 
campaign. "We intend to rename the Russian Management Academy 
the Russian Academy of Civil Service and educate there new 
politicians from among provincial political leaders, 
entrepreneurs, and other categories of Russian citizens," he 
said. Furthermore, education of future cadres, according to the 
presidential chief of staff, will be facilitated by the pending 
law on civil service. 
  Talking about the state anticrime program, Mr. Filatov 
estimated it at 4 billion rubles. Until this program has begun 
to work at full capacity, Filatov called for support for the 
Moscow mayor's initiative, and "everywhere, where it is possible 
and where there are sufficient funds and the will exists, create 
workers' volunteer groups to maintain order in residential 
districts."

  [Text] Moscow, 30 May -- "The adoption of a new land code 
has been necessitated by a discrepancy between current land laws 
and the Russian constitution, as well as a number of 
presidential decrees and government resolutions," according to 
Russian Federation Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking 
to the participants in a meeting at the government house. The 
main disadvantage of the 1991 code, i.e. the lack of the concept 
of "land ownership," has been eliminated in the draft of the law 
submitted today for debate by heads of administrations. 
  For the first time a land law stipulates a procedure for 
acquiring land by juridical persons (by transferring land plots 
and parcels of land to enterprises' authorized capital or 
through purchase of land), V. Chernomyrdin said. 
  The draft of the new land code also contains a description 
of 
procedures for land deals by physical persons (buying, selling, 
or mortgage operations), as well as giving or inheriting land. 
It stipulates that owners of inherited land plots can become 
owners if they wish. However, if a land plot is larger than the 
maximum size allowed for a transfer of land ownership free of 
charge, the remaining part may be kept as non-transferable 
inheritance or bought out in credit. 
  In accordance with the current constitution, the draft of 
the 
land code transfers a larger proportion of land regulation 
rights to the constituent parts of the federation, unlike the 
present land law, the prime minister said.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- The programme of privatisation 
of state and municipal enterprises in Russia after July 1, 1994 
was submitted for approval to a conference of regional heads 
held in the building of the Russian Government on Monday. 
  The conference was addressed by chairman of the Russian 
committee for state property, Anatoliy Chubays, who said that 
unlike the first stage of voucher privatisation, during the 
second stage priority will be given to quality standards. 
  The evaluation of property to be privatised after July 1, 
will be made in prices which were in effect as of January 1, 
1994. The market value of a privatised object will differ from 
the starting price by several dozen per cent, rather than by 
several dozen times, Chubays said. 
  The programme of post-voucher privatisation will enable 
local 
authorities to increase the starting cost of property by 70-200 
per cent, depending on conditions of each particular region, 
Chubays said. Privileges granted to work collectives in the 
course of privatisation have underwent substantial changes in 
the new programme. Workers and managers of enterprises who will 
prefer the first variant will be given only 25 per cent of 
privileged shares (while under the programme in effect today, 
workers and managers, including the directors' corps, received 
40 per cent of the athorised stock). 
  A second variant, which is the most popular among privatised 
enterprises, envisages that only 10 per cent of shares will 
given to them on privileged terms (against 51 per cent in effect 
today.) 
  Nevertheless, privatised enterprises will be allowed to 
appropriate 51 percent of all revenues from privatisation, 
Chubays said, adding that this measure will help former 
state-run enterprises overcome the structural crisis as soon as 
possible.

according to chief banker Viktor Gerashchenko. 
  He told a press conference on Tuesday that a system which is

this year. It will monitor all import and export operations. 
  The chairman of the central bank denied press reports that 
he 
objected to the six economic decrees signed by the president of

reforms, although certain changes in legislation would be 
necessary for that. 
  Gerashchenko added that the president is expected to sign a 
decree lifting certain limitations on the activities of foreign 
banks in Russia.

in Moscow 27 May: "Boris Yeltsin: We Have No Surplus Land. 
Russian Federation President's Speech at Ceremonial Meeting 
Devoted To Border Guard Day, 27 May 1994"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Border Guards! 
  Dear Veterans! 
  I first want to cordially congratulate all defenders of the 
border and also your families on your professional holiday -- 
Border Guard Day. 
  On behalf of the whole Russian people I express my thanks 
and 
gratitude to you for your selfless service to the fatherland! 
  There are veterans of the Border Guards in this room. 
Several generations of Russian citizens have been raised on 
your exploits. I express sincere gratitude to you for your feats 
of arms defending the borders of our motherland. I do not doubt 
that you are still at your posts. Your experience and knowledge 
are needed even today. 
  Russian border guards worthily preserve and continue the 
traditions of older generations. On this day I cannot fail to 
point out that in 1993-1994 alone six servicemen in the Border 
Guards were awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation 
[RF]. More than 400 border guards have been awarded Russian 
orders and medals. 
  Russia's border guards protect the borders of our fatherland 
sometimes at the cost of their own blood. They sometimes pay 
with their lives to ensure the security of the state and uphold 
Russia's interests. 
  We bow our heads to those who have died defending the 
borders 
of our fatherland. We will always remember them, their feats in 
the name of Russia. I ask you to observe a minute's silence in 
glorious memory of those who died doing their military duty. 
  Esteemed Border Guards! 
  I think that you will understand me if I talk first about 
the 
problems facing the border guards today, on the eve of your 
professional holiday, our common holiday. 
  Our fundamental aim is to build a strong democratic state. 
One of its main attributes being effective protection of the 
State Border. 
  In many respects it is here that the fate of Russia's 
territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security is decided. 
  In two weeks the Federal Border Service [FBS] will celebrate 
its second anniversary. You are having to work in an extremely 
complex and in many respects new situation. Tense conditions of 
service, the lack of amenities for units and subunits on the new 
borders, and other difficulties have been unable to disrupt your 
work. 
  The fundamental reorganization of the system of guarding 
Russia's border is being actively carried out with consideration 
for the new geopolitical situation. 
  I assess positively the work to systematically withdraw 
border guard groupings from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and 
Azerbaijan and deploy them on the border with the Baltic 
countries and in the North Caucasus. The Western Group of 
Border Guards and the Caucasus Special Border District have been 
created within a very short period. 
  The Border Guards are taking an active part in maintaining 
a stable situation on Russia's borders and the external borders 
of the Commonwealth states. 
  I want to underline the importance of the tasks that you are 
preforming in the hot spots and particularly in the combat 
conditions on the Tajik-Afghan border. Far from the motherland 
our border guards are guarding its national interests. Let me 
be blunt and say that they are defending Russia from war with 
might and main. 
  Personnel have remained loyal to their duty, manifesting 
their best qualities. On all the borders the border guards are 
largely successful in performing their tasks. 
  The period that has seen the formation of the FBS can be 
said 
to be coming to an end. The foundations of qualitatively new 
troops have been laid. A base for their development exists. 
  The State Border is defended in spite of everything. And I 
am convinced that the stability of Russia's borders will 
continue to grow stronger. 
  A conference with the FBS leadership has just come to an 
end. 
I can say on the basis of its results that as president I fully 
support the line being implemented by your Service. 
  The correct course has been taken of organizing a civilized 
Russian border. It accords with the principles of a democratic, 
federative, rule-of-law state which are enshrined in the RF 
Constitution. 
  While there is no concept of national security the FBS 
shoulders a considerable share of the responsibility for 
Russia's fate. It cannot be any other way! 
  Adopting a formal approach and waiting for instructions -- 
in 
our conditions -- is the best sign that things will go wrong. 
Now when state mechanisms are being fine-tuned and when the 
normative base is still only being formed initiative -- 
responsible initiative, furthermore -- is not just a boon but 
the most important factor of the viability of the state. 
  I am glad that the FBS is up to the task. You have set a 
high standard and are actively searching for new and original 
solutions. I thank you for this, Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev, I 
thank you all. 
  Border troops face new and more complex tasks. Previously 
the State Border was a frontier which divided our country from 
the world and partitioned off the peoples. 
  Now we have to ensure that the border becomes an impregnable 
wall only to threats to Russian national interests and the 
security of the state. 
  The border must be closed to terrorism, drugs trafficking, 
smuggling, and illegal immigration by foreigners. 
  The most important task facing border troops is to prevent 
armed provocation. 
  At the same time the State Border must not be an artificial 
obstacle to the development of cooperation, business contacts, 
communication between people, and spiritual ties. We will 
create a firm legal basis for that. 
  Russia needs a long-term state border policy. I can state 
with full responsibility that we have a clear notion of the 
borders and zones of protection of Russian interests. We can 
see clearly the role and place of the FBS in the national 
security system. 
  It is your service which is called upon to organize the 
elaboration of border policy and establish stable cooperation 
with all the interested departments in implmenting it. 
  In this connection I shall express our fundamental position: 
Russia has no territorial claims on any country. We want the 
civilized solution of the border demarcation problem. But we 
will firmly defend the interests of the Russian Federation's 
territorial integrity. We in Russia have no surplus or 
unnecessary land! 
  Experience in the adoption of well-balanced state decisions 
on border questions is now being accumulated. You have an 
insider's understanding of all these problems. And is it you 
who must take a clear stand and uphold it more boldly. 
  The protection of the border is not just a matter for the 
Border Troops. It is a most important task for the whole state, 
all state structures, components of the federation, and organs 
of power in the border regions. 
  At the conference with your leadership we discussed the 
results of Putina-94, the border operations in the South Kurils 
sector, and Zaslon-4, the border operations in the Pskov sector, 
and a number of other operations. 
  They are important not just as realistic examples of 
cooperation among border troops, army men, sailors, intelligence 
and counterintelligence officers, the customs services, and 
local organs of power. 
  Such operations produce a tremendous economic effect which 
can be calculated in billions of rubles. 
  It is hard to overestimate the political significance of 
these operations. The more actively we conduct them the more 
Russia will be respected in the international arena. 
  But even that is not the main thing. The first reports on 
Zaslon and Putina produced a sigh of relief from many people. 
"At last they have begun to establish order! At last they have 
dealt a blow to those who are tearing our national assets to 
shreds." 
  Each of your successes restores people's hope, dignity, and 
sense of pride in their country. 
  The important thing is that such operations should not be 
irregular but systematic in character. They must be held in 
other sectors at land and sea. 
  Act energetically and resolutely in the future, too. Know 
that the Russian leadership and I will give you support. 
Russia's interests in all sections of the state border must be 
reliably protected. 
  Russia's borders are new. A significant part of them adjoin 
new states. There is much work ahead to ensure their definitive 
shaping and equipping. 
  What are the approaches to the protection of the border by 
the Border Troops of the Russian Federation? 
  The issue here must not be solely the use of force to 
protect 
our borders. State border policy must be based first and 
foremost on political and diplomatic approaches. 
  This presumes the peaceful and nonviolent solution of 
disputes as they arise, the development of cooperation in the 
protection of the border with neighboring states, and the use of 
armed forces and methods only in extreme circumstances. 
  It is necessary to involve the inhabitants of border 
regions, 
especially the Cossacks, in the protection of the border. 
Especially since they have expressed a desire to do that. 
  It is important to do this primarily in the new areas of the 
border where such traditions have not been established yet. 
  The specifics of the political situation demand a 
differentiated approach to the protection of the borders. I 
shall dwell on that question in greater detail. 
  With such states as Norway and Finland, for example, Russia 
has firm relations of partnership. Our borders are equipped and 
their protection must be carried out on principles of 
good-neighborliness and cooperation. 
  As for the Baltic countries, Russia advocates the 
development 
of good-neighborliness with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and 
the expansion of cooperation with them. But these states do not 
belong to the CIS and therefore the border regime there must be 
a full-fledged one [polnotsennyy]. Its protection must be 
organized correspondingly. 
  Russia's border with Belarus is transparent. The external 
border is protected here by Belarus. We have assumed 
commitments to participate in shared financing of its border 
structures. The question of protecting the Russian-Belarusian 
border does not figure on the agenda. 
  The protection of the border with Ukraine will be structured 
in keeping with the measures taken by the Ukrainian side. We 
have discussed this today at the conference. But, given the 
common history of our peoples, we would like to resolve this 
task through joint efforts. 
  I endorse the Federal Border Service's efforts in organizing 
the protection of the border in the Caucasus along two lines -- 
on the external borders of the states of Georgia and Armenia and 
on Russia's state border. At the same time, it is essential to 
step up the work of preparing the Memorandum on Joint Protection 
of the Borders in this area. 
  Everyone knows that there are outstanding issues here. These 
relate to questions of our security -- not just the security of 
the state but the security of actual citizens and their 
families. They must be resolved as quickly as possible. 
  A good basis for developing the cooperation of Commonwealth 
border structures has been created in the Central Asian region, 
namely the Memorandum on the Joint Protection of External 
Borders. Collaboration on this basis should be increased and 
consolidated. 
  Attention must also be paid to strengthening the protection 
of the border with Mongolia. Given the dynamics of our 
relations with China, I also regard it as feasible to carry out 
the protection of the state border here on the principles of 
cooperation. 
  It is essential to improve the protection of the border in 
the Arctic and Pacific regions and to take measures to defend 
Russia's economic interests. 
  Interstate cooperation in border protection is an important 
function of the border service. Such cooperation has already 
become a reality in a number of sections of the state border. 
And we maintain that line. 
  It is important to apply this experience not just to the 
border structures of Commonwealth states but to those of other 
neighboring countries too. 
  This is a real mechanism for guaranteeing collective 
security. This is the way toward consolidating stability. And 
not just on the border but in the states themselves. 
  The border troops's participation in active peacemaking 
activity is equally important. This is a new task for border 
troops. You are successfully tackling it in the North Caucasus 
and the Central Asian regions. It is difficult to overestimate 
its significance! I will say frankly that you have saved 
thousands of lives of citizens of not just Russia but certain 
other Commonwealth states too. 
  Participation in maintaining political stability in the 
Russian border zone is an important area of activity for border 
troops. 
  The border troops have always been active exponents of state 
policy in the border regions, and people have understood you. 
Given the special nature of this moment, I regard this task as a 
priority. 
  It is essential to develop small-scale diplomacy -- the work 
of border missions and other forms of cooperation among border 
structures -- everywhere. 
  You will thereby help to the maximum extent the conduct of 
the Russian Federation's foreign policy course. 
  I want to draw special attention to the need to tighten up 
military discipline without fail. 
  I am convinced that the task of reliably protecting the 
border cannot be resolved unless the task of strengthening law 
and order within the troops is resolved. 
  Esteemed border troops, 
  You are faced with large-scale and difficult tasks. Their 
successful fulfilment will depend on the sense of 
responsibility, initiative, and effectiveness of the command and 
staffs and the coordinated work of all organs of command and 
control. 
  It is essential to bring the Law "On the Russian Federation 
State Border" and other state and then departmental statutory 
instruments into line with the Constitution as rapidly as 
possible. 
  I keep a constant watch on the preparation of laws, the 
absence of which creates a vacuum in the defense of Russia's 
political and economic interests on its state boreder. 
  I know that the border troops are beset by quite a few acute 
and painful problems. They are basically down to the pretty 
difficult socioeconomic situation that obtains in the country. 
  We will help you solve them primarily by provision of 
finance, facilities, and accommodations. 
  We will take measures to enhance the social and legal 
protection afforded servicemen, members of their families, and 
veterans. 
  I stress that this will be done by enhancing, not reducing, 
protection. Various rumors circulate in places on this 
question. Therefore I confirm my position of principle: I will 
not -- as president -- allow any restriction on the social and 
legal benefits enjoyed by servicemen. 
  From time immemorial the Russian people have regarded the 
border troops with love and respect. I am sure that we will 
remain true to that glorious tradition. 
  You protect the borders of the fatherland. The border troops 
are supported in this by the huge might of Russia. Russia knows 
and believes that you protect its peace and security, whatever 
this may cost you. 
  Once again I congratulate the generals, admirals, officers, 
warrant officers, petty officers, sergeants, soldiers, and 
sailors of the Border Troops, workers and employees, and members 
of the families of border troops on your upcoming professional 
holiday. 
  I wish you, esteemed border troops, success in the difficult 
service you perform on behalf of the Russian state! 
  I would ask you to convey my sincere congratulations on your 
holiday to all those who perform border service on the borders 
of the motherland and to your nearest and dearest!

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin addressed a meeting held in Moscow on the occasion of 
the day of border guards, expressing a principal position on 
problems of social welfare of servicemen and their families. 
Yeltsin pointed out that as the Russian president, he will not 
allow any social or legal cuts for people wearing shoulder 
straps. Yeltsin pointed out that social problems faced by 
servicemen are the result of the economic situation in the 
country. 
  The Russian president heartily congratulated border guards 
on 
the occasion of the day of border guards, he pointed out that 
over the past 1.5 years, the title of the Hero of the Russian 
Federation was conferred upon six border guards, and over 400 
border guards were awarded with medals and orders. 
  During the meeting a minute of silence was observed in 
memory 
of border guards who were killed defending Russian borders.

  [Text] The leader of Russia's Choice parliamentary group 
Yegor Gaydar believes that the country cannot afford the Army in 
its present form. The Army is chronically financed improperly 
and begins to lag behind rivals technically because it is too 
big for Russian resources. Gaydar spoke on Saturday at a Moscow 
conference of supporters of forming a party on the basis of 
Russia's Choice. 
  Gaydar said Russia inherited from the Soviet Union an army 
that is meant for an absolutely different number of conscripts. 
"We are trying to adjust the number of conscripts to the number 
of our generals instead of doing it the other way round", Gaydar 
said. 
  "We need a well-armed, well-paid, well-fed professional and 
respected army, but it should be notably reformed for the 
purpose", Gaydar said. According to him, if this problem is not 
resolved the problems of raising taxes and curtailing inflation 
will never be resolved and the country will continue printing 
worthless money. 
  Meanwhile, Russia's Choice, Gaydar said, does not support 
the 
proposal to boost the defence budget to 55 billion rubles. 
During the coming budget debate in the Duma Gaydar intends to 
insist on the submission to parliament of a program of cuts in 
armed forces.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Airwaves Put in the </F>
`Guardroom'"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense 
Information and Press Directorate, so beloved of all military 
journalists, recently came down like a ton of bricks on the 
Defense Ministry's Central Television and Radio Studio. In a 
memorandum to the defense minister, General Kosarev, chief of 
this directorate, mounted a swinging attack on the whole of the 
Central Television and Radio Studio's activity: "It has been 
unable to give a wide and full representation on the television 
screen and on air of the process of developing and building the 
Russian Army. Positive aspects and problems have been left out 
of the picture altogether...," and so forth. Consequently, 
Grachev is informed, the "Slavyanka" radio station, for example, 
is virtually unlistened to in Tajikistan -- there the fighters 
are busy "tuning their radio sets to other wavelengths." 
  The general also brings to the minister's attention the fact 
that the Central Television and Radio Studio is rife with 
nepotism, financial irregularities, and illegal payments to 
private individuals. Kosarev proposes -- with a view to 
ensuring that everything is about highlighting the achievements 
of the Russian Army -- that it is necessary "to completely 
replace the former leadership of the Central Television and 
Radio Studio and bolster the studio with more experienced 
cadres.... A financial group should be established under the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Information and Press 
Directorate to organize monitoring of the financial activity of 
the Defense Ministry Central Television and Radio Studio." 
  This memorandum has come as a bombshell to the Central 
Television and Radio Studio. Studio chief Colonel Yakubovskiy 
(not to be confused with General Dima Yakubovskiy) was on the 
point of rushing to Grachev with a memorandum of his own, 
accusing Kosarev of disinforming the defense minister, 
misrepresenting the facts, and other errors. The colonel also 
has a fair selection of arguments in reserve. Pavel Grachev is 
theoretically the arbitrator who is supposed to determine who is 
telling the truth. But he is too busy. Consequently the Central 
Television and Radio Studio is quaking in its boots, Kosarev is 
wandering ominously around the Ministry of Defense clenching his 
fists, Yakubovskiy is running from office to office in search of 
protection, and the decision has been postponed. Ordinary 
journalists are the main victims of this skirmishing in the 
military information structures.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Viktor Tkachenko; from </F>
the "Military Courier" program] 
  [Text] Our next reports come from different garrisons but 
they are all connected with one common problem, the Armed 
Forces' budget. The Defense Ministry's shortage of cash is now 
affecting the holy of holy's, the Army and Navy, and their 
combat training. The development of up-to-date armaments and 
equipment is also being curtailed. 
  [Tkachenko] This is the state's missile test range at 
Plesetsk. Our latest and most powerful missile, the Topol, is 
being tested here. The testing of these missiles may have to be 
substantially curtailed because of the shortage of finance. If 
this happens, the combat readiness of missile forces could be 
impaired because, unlike many other units of the Russian Army, 
the missile troops are on duty 24 hours a day. The upkeep of our 
nuclear missile shield is comparable with the running of a 
modern nuclear power station. 
  The strategic missile forces, which consume less than seven 
percent of the overall defense budget--a modest sum in 
quantitative terms, are a very important argument that is always 
present in the background at all talks with leading foreign 
countries. At the moment Russia's intercontinental Topols are 
flying reliably and hitting their targets. Will they be turned, 
like their predecessors, the SS-20s, into [word indistinct] 
heaps of metal? Will Russia continue to be a great power or will 
it turn into a banana republic? Today this does not depend on 
the missile troops but on the politicians.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] The launch of the next Mir 
crew has been postponed, as Colonel General Vladimir Ivanov, 
commander of Russia's Military Space Forces, has confirmed. 
According to unofficial information, the launch has had to be 
postponed because of a hold-up in testing the nose fairing on 
the Soyuz spacecraft: The fairing covers the craft during the 
launch when the rocket is going through the Earth's atmosphere. 
TM-19 was initially due to blast off on 20 June; now the 
possibilities of carrying out a launch on the 29 or 31 June are 
being examined. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tbilisi, 28 May -- Eduard Shevardnadze had 
discussions in Tbilisi today with Lieutenant General Aleksandr 
Sokolov, deputy commander in chief of the emergency land forces 
of the Russian Defence Ministry, about the mechanism for 
introducing and deploying peacekeeping forces in the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. 
  Gen. Sokolov visited Abkhazia earlier on the same mission 
and 
is reported to have spent the day before the meeting 
reconnoitering at the Inguri River, the place proposed for the 
deployment of the peacekeeping contingent to disengage the 
warring sides. According to unconfirmed information, about 
3,000 servicemen can be ready to carry out this task within a 
few hours. 
  In accordance with the Georgian-Abkhaz agreements previously 
reached under the aegis of the United Nations and with Russian 
mediation, the peacekeeping forces are also to ensure the 
security of the refugees returning to their previous places of 
residence. Various sources put their number at 250-300,000. 
  Offical sources in Tbilisi are not reporting any details 
about the meeting between Eduard Shevardnadze and are not 
commenting on it. However, to judge from the way events are 
developing, the peacekeeping troops may be introduced into the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone in the very near future.

  [Text] At their Saturday's talks in Tbilisi with a Russian 
military delegation Eduard Shevardnadze and his Defence 
Minister, Vardiko Nadibaidze, discussed the details of an 
operation aimed at deploying Russian peace-keepers in Georgia. 
The delegation was led by the Deputy Commander of Russia's 
ground troops, Aleksey Sokolov. As Interfax learned from the 
press service of the Georgian leader, the peace-keepers are to 
be stationed in the safety areas set up in Zugdidi and Gali 
Regions. 
  As Interfax learned from a well-informed source in Georgia's 
Defence Ministry, the operation will involve about 3000 
servicemen and begin in early June. The return of Georgian 
refugees to Gali Region is to begin about June 10, he said. No 
official source in Tbilisi agreed to comment on the course of 
the talks. 
  In the meantime the Deputy Commander of the group of Russian 
troops stationed in Trans-Caucasus, Major-General Vasiliy 
Belchenko, told Interfax that the consultations on the 
deployment of Russian peace-keepers in Georgia "are proceeding 
with difficulty." "Even though an agreement on the deployment 
of troops has been reached in principle, there are some 
differences between the Georgian and Abkhaz sides," he said. 
  "Evidently the events should not be anticipated," Belchenko 
said. "The results of talks must be divulged by the heads of 
state." As for the participation of Russian troops stationed in 
Trans-Caucasus in the upcoming operation, he said that "this 
question has not been settled yet. The present plans provide 
for moving troops from Russia." "If they prove to be 
insufficient, units from the group of Russian troops stationed 
in Trans-Caucasus will join in," the general said.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Georgian forces which have 
occupied positions above the village of Lata in the Kodor Gorge 
fired over 100 howitzer shells on local Abkhazian settlements 
over three days, TASS was told by the press service of the 
Abkhazian parliament on Tuesday. 
  Georgian units tried to drive Abkhazians out of their 
positions overnight, but were repelled, it added. 
  The village of Lata again became the strategic point for 
which the conflicting sides are fighting. The Georgian forces 
which were pushed up into the mountains want to seize it for a 
further offensive down into Abkhazia. Abkhazians, naturally, 
are defending the stronghold. 
  Military experts predict that combat activities will 
intensify in the gorge soon as the important location provides 
an access to the Black Sea. The forecasts are proved by several 
days of artillery preparations by Georgian forces.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shegoleva] </F>
  [Text] Sochi May 30 TASS -- A regular session of a 
quadripartite commission held in Sochi on Monday discussed the 
return of Abkhazian refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia. 
  Taking part in the session of the commission are 
representatives from a mission of a U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees, the Russian Federation, Georgia and Abkhazia. The 
commission is expected to look into a procedure of registering 
refugees and all those who wish to return, and problems of 
conducting an information campaign. 
  "There are strong differences between the sides about the 
number of people wishing to return," said Deputy Chairman of the 
Abkhazian Council of Ministers, Leonid Lakerbaya. "Abkhazia is 
against using any approximate figures," he said. "In accordance 
with an agreement signed in Moscow the right to return to 
Abkhazia is given to all those who did not take part in military 
operations. We shall abide by this rule," Lakerbaya added. 
  Abkhazian representatives insist on the fact that the 
process 
of refugee return should not be stepped up. For the time being, 
they are prepared to discuss the return of refugees to the Galsk 
region only. Lakerbaya believes that at the first stage, no 
more than 200 applications, asking for permission to return, 
shall be accepted, while the Georgian side insists on the fact 
that the process of refugee return be stepped up as much as 
possible. 
  Another demand made by the Abkhazian side is that those who 
wish to return must confirm that they will not fight against the 
lawful authorities and pledge to comply with Abkhazian laws. 
  A group of experts in charge of the information campaign met 
before the commission began its work. Deputy Chairman of the 
Abkhazian Minister of the Press and Information Beslan Gurdzhua 
told ITAR-TASS that it is necessary to inform people about 
current developments and create a favourable psychological 
climate. "People are being frightened by statements on mass 
return of refugees," Gurdzhua said. "No social and economic 
conditions for this have been created in the republic yet, " he 
added.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry press service has issued a 
statement which says: As the process of conflict settlement and 
the return of refugees to Abkhazia seems increasingly feasible, 
armed units of Abkhaz separatists and their loyal propagandists 
are stepping up their activity. They are using any means to 
rekindle the atmosphere of irreconcilability between the 
Georgians and the Abkhaz. 
  It is surprising that the Abkhaz separatists' armed 
provocations against the defenders of Georgian villages of the 
Kodori gorge and the Inguri river are followed by prompt and 
negative reaction from the Russian media, which invariably 
accuse the Georgian side of violating the agreement. That is 
how it was on 28 April, 10 May, 20 May and also today, 30 May, 
when, following a massive week-long artillery attack by the 
Abkhaz separatists on villages in the Kodori gorge, the Russian 
media, quoting Abkhaz information sources, reported to the world 
community that Georgian artillery was shelling Abkhaz positions 
in Kodori. To put it mildly, we do not understand this bias 
displayed by Russian colleagues. 
  The press service of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic 
of Georgia categorically denies this new disinformation 
disseminated by the Russian media and calls on the colleagues to 
report events in an objective and unbiased manner.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F>
Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani; place 
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, I believe when speaking 
of the most significant issues of the past week, we have to 
begin with the 26 May holiday [Georgia's Independence Day]. 
Georgia celebrated this holiday as befits a state and a 
military parade was also held. We can recall heated arguments 
just before 26 May. Some people expressed the opinion that 
defeated troops should not hold a parade. However, it was not 
merely a parade of defeated or victorious troops; it was a 
celebration of the 26 May holiday with a military parade. The 
parade was eventually held, as well as numerous other fetes 
which you also attended. How necessary do you think it was to 
celebrate this day in this way? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Now that we have an 
opportunity to analyze everything that occurred in the past days 
pertaining to 26 May, I believe the authorities' decision to 
hold a parade has proved to be right. One often encounters the 
view that we do not have a sense of statehood, and we also hear 
many other nihilistic remarks about our country, our state, our 
independence, and so on. This sort of celebration was necessary 
simply in order to demonstrate to the world not only that we 
have a sense of statehood and realize the necessity to build our 
statehood, but also the fact that appropriate structures and 
attributes have already been created. This was necessary to 
prove the above and in order that the people could see what had 
already been done. 
  You are well aware that many opponents were categorically 
opposed to holding the parade for understandable reasons. Some, 
I suppose, intended to hold a grandiose antigovernment and 
antistate rally, or, rather, rallies directed against the 
authorities; naturally, this parade and other fetes would 
frustrate their plans. They were probably afraid that the 
rallies they had planned could lose their grandeur. Nothing 
terrible has happened. The parade has been held. The people 
have celebrated the day. The rallies were also held. Let the 
people judge which was more significant. 
  The idea that defeated troops never hold parades is wrong 
and 
even harmful. The people, even defeated people, restore their 
strength, build an army, and establish a police force, and the 
authorities support the people in this great deed. All of this 
is a guarantee of success in building a state. [passage omitted] 
  Just before the 26 May holiday, I signed a few documents, 
later discussed by the Cabinet of Ministers, about speeding up 
the process of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The 
documents stipulate active participation in this process of the 
enterprises' employees, including their managers. All 
provisions will be given finishing touches. All this will be 
published in the press, and the printing of vouchers for the 
purchase of shares will be speeded up. The idea is that members 
of labor collectives, their managers, and the corps of managers, 
as well as each citizen of the republic, will become actual 
proprietors. They will not be big owners, but each citizen will 
have a definite share in the wealth created in the country over 
the past decades. Provided the wealth expands, the citizen's 
property will also become more significant. 
  I would also like to support an initiative launched by the 
Georgian savings bank and its newly appointed president, Mr. 
Chkhartishvili. He is a brilliant young man with a very good 
way of thinking, and he has started his job very well. In 
accordance with this initiative, every depositor -- and there 
are many thousands of them -- will become a shareholder, in 
effect one of the owners of the bank. Yesterday, I decided to 
support a request to reduce the state's share, which is very big 
and comprises dozen of billions [unit not specified], and the 
sum will actually be distributed among the shareholders. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, on 25 May up to 40 political and 
social organizations signed a declaration of national accord and 
unity. It was a document you called for at the meeting of the 
board of the Union of Georgia's Citizens on your return from a 
Moscow summit of the CIS countries on 16 April. The board 
consented and the response was very good. Apart from its 
symbolic significance of this, do you think there are any 
prospects of real unity, as you said after the parade when you 
quoted a verse by Galaktion [Galaktion Tabidze, a Georgian poet] 
calling for unity? 
  [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] I would say that this lays 
a 
foundation for future deeds. Some will join the movement, 
others will probably dissociate themselves from it. However, 
the movement for unity and integrity and the apprehension of 
responsibilities for the state will take deeper roots among our 
people and in the country generally. 
  Like many citizens of our country, I am categorically 
opposed 
to an unhealthy politicization of the community. However, I 
will support politicization if it means that politics is 
associated with the idea of statehood, with a concern for the 
state, with tasks of building the state. In this respect, the 
declaration is undoubtedly a step forward in the sense that it 
fosters concern for the state and its building and helps unite 
all forces. 
  [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the topic of Abkhazia was in the air 
last week. We know that a working team led by Lieutenant 
General [Aleksandr] Sokolov arrived from Moscow to study issues 
regarding the stationing of peacekeeping forces. Have any 
practical steps been taken in this respect? 
  [Shevardnadze] I am still reluctant to speak of details. 
However, it was a necessary and useful meeting. I am reluctant 
to speak about any details because the UN Security Council 
resolution on the issue is to be made public this week. The 
resolution is to be passed this week. Thus far, the Security 
Council has not passed a resolution consenting to the deployment 
of peacekeeping forces and extending the role of UN observers 
and their new mandate. 
  This issue, I mean a draft resolution, is also being 
considered by the heads of CIS countries. The draft has been 
distributed, and I have received my copy. That is natural, 
because it was initiated at my request. The Russian president, 
Mr. Yeltsin, has sent the draft to the heads of all states. As 
far as I know, the first response is positive and an adequate 
resolution may be passed. 
  In fact, almost everything is being prepared, everything is 
done to secure the earliest possible beginning of a peacekeeping 
operation. However, as I have already said, it will take a 
certain time to make a political decision. It may take several 
days or one or two weeks. After the decision is made, almost 
everything will be ready for starting a stage-by-stage 
peacekeeping operation. This is what we have recently been 
considering in Tbilisi with Mr. Sokolov and others. 
  I would also like to say that people should not imagine that 
the return of refugees to their homes will happen like this: 
that one day all bridges will be opened and 250,000 or 300,000 
people will return simultaneously. This is unbelievable. This 
is impossible. An enormous amount of preparatory work will have 
to be done. I will sign an edict in this connection later 
today. The beginning of the process is approaching and a great 
deal of preparatory work has to be done. 
  There is no doubt that the refugees will return to ravaged 
and destroyed properties. Nothing has been sown there; nothing 
has been looked after. One can say, if you will, that life will 
have to start from the very beginning. How can this be 
accomplished? What resources are available in the country? Who 
will help us? How can we help each family and each refugee? 
All these questions are causing great concern. On their 
return, the refugees should be given a minimum of essentials 
required for their existence and work -- I mean bread, fuel, 
building materials, and fundamental things to enable a person to 
come back and start work. We will have to do all this. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. A tragic event occurred in Ingushetia 
last week: eight Georgian specialists were killed, or rather 
slaughtered. In addition, this was done in the territory of the 
people with whom Georgia has always had warm, good, and really 
neighborly and friendly relations. Do you think this crime had 
a political aim? I realize that it is difficult to speak of 
this until the investigation is completed. 
  [Shevardnadze] I would say that we have had an exceptionally 
friendly and fraternal relationship with the president of 
Ingushetia and the Ingush people, like many other peoples, for 
instance, the peoples of Dagestan or North Ossetia. Although 
our relations with North Ossetia have lately become complicated, 
we used to have really magnificent relations. Well, this is the 
truth with almost all peoples. However, our relations with the 
Ingush people have been remarkable for decades and even for 
centuries. 
  I have to tell you that the Ingushs have intense feelings 
about the tragedy similar to those we experience here in 
Georgia. Some sequences have been shown on our television. It 
goes without saying, first of all, that I would like to express 
my sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased. 
The road that is being built should by all means be built, and 
it will be named after them. The bridge linking the two peoples 
will undoubtedly be linked with their names. 
  Whoever committed this savage act naturally intended to ruin 
Georgia's relations with someone, to ruin Ingushetia's relations 
with someone, to ruin Ingush-Georgian relations. Perhaps they 
intended to obstruct the process of improving Georgian-Ossetian 
relations, or to hinder the ongoing development of contacts with 
Dagestan, North Ossetia, and other republics -- and with Russia 
in general. This was a provocative plan. However, I would like 
to reiterate that whoever the executioners were, whichever 
nation they represented, terrorists remain terrorists. We will 
never identify them with the people in general, and I am 
convinced that this event will exert no influence on our 
friendship with the Ingush people and with other peoples, and we 
will do our best to build new relations with the peoples of 
Caucasia, especially North Caucasia, on the basis of what is 
called the best age-old traditions of friendship and fraternity. 
  [Oniani] Finally, Batono Eduard, in your address dedicated 
to 26 May -- which was entitled: We will build a new independent 
democratic Georgia -- you said: I would not say that the world 
has been currently divided into spheres of influence between 
superpowers, the giants of East and West. However, one thing is 
clear, that when the sun shines, a shadow is cast somewhere on 
the earth. This is definitely natural for every region. How 
about Georgia? 
  [Shevardnadze] This will undoubtedly lead us to the question 
of where the sun rises. This is a figure of speech, of course. 
In the language of politicians, this means a balance of 
interests. The share of various countries in the balance of 
interests differs. Its volume and its extent differ. 
  Russia is not the only country with which Georgia has a 
balance of interests. We have a balance of interests with other 
countries too. Turkey has interests in our country, and we have 
interests in Turkey. The same is true of Iran, of other 
neighbors, and of other countries, say the West, say the United 
States of America and so on. Since Russia has always been 
considered the most interested party, I can say that Russia 
really has definite interests in Georgia. I do not conceal 
this, neither does President Yeltsin. He has said so. Nor do we 
conceal that Georgia has even more interests in Russia. Thus, a 
shadow falls not only in Georgia but also in Russia. The same 
can be said about other countries. 
  We should speak less about spheres of influence and more 
about a balance of interests, a proportionateness of interests, 
and a compatibility of interests with processes taking place in 
the world. Thus, when speaking about spheres of interests we 
have to consider that this sounds different today. This is not 
a post-World War II or a post-World War I period; nor is it a 
situation similar to that in past centuries, when this was an 
established practice. Nowadays, the approach is a little 
different. 
  [Oniani] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku May 27 TASS -- One should learn lessons from 
the history in order not to repeat the mistakes which resulted 
in the Azeri loss of independence 74 years ago, Azeri President 
Geydar Aliyev told a ceremonious meeting on the occasion of the 
independence day here today. The national holiday will be 
marked on May 28. 
  In the opinion of the Azeri state head, there is much in 
common between today and a period from 1918 through 1920, the 
time of the first Azeri Democratic Republic. "Same as in 
1918-1920, Azerbaijan is under powerful pressure of outer 
forces, its territory has been subjected to an aggression, 
complicated political processes are underway to weaken 
statehood," said Aliyev. 
  Many events of the Azeri history, including the Soviet 
period, should have an objective estimation, said the president. 
In his opinion, the Soviet period was a "significant historical 
time for Azerbaijan which did not lose its statehood being part 
of the Soviet Union and losing its independence". The republic 
managed to create a huge economic, cultural, social and 
intellectual potential. 
  The current path taken by Azerbaijan aims to build an 
independent, democratic and law-governed state to guarantee all 
rights and freedoms of citizens, their equality regardless 
nationality or religion, said Aliyev. The republic remains 
adherent to the market reforms which aim to ensure high living 
standards of the population. 
  In the foreign political sphere Azerbaijan stands for equal 
mutually beneficial relations with all states. 
  Speaking of the Armenian-Azeri conflict, the president 
stressed that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful settlement within the 
framework of international organizations and in cooperation with 
the leading nations, including Russia. 
  At the same time, Azeri conditions remain unchanged -- 
provision of territorial integrity and inviolability of Azeri 
borders, liberation of all the occupied lands of Azerbaijan, and 
the return of refugees to places of their permanent residence. 
The problem can be solved on condition of observation of these 
fundamental principles. 
  The president stressed the intention to continue the peace 
talks, but said that the national army should be ready to 
protect the Azeri borders and territory.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani president has not yet signed an 
edict on lowering the quorum in parliament. So, an appeal by 28 
deputies to Geydar Aliyev requesting that the requisite quorum 
at the National Assembly be reduced from 34 to 26 deputies has 
so far gone unanswered; the measure is designed to help 
circumvent the discussion of the Bishkek protocol that has been 
demanded in an ultimatum by a group of the parliament's 
opposition members, who walked out from the previous meeting for 
an indefinite period. 
  KHABAR-SERVICE's correspondent learned this from sources at 
the presidential staff. The news agency also reports that 
although such an edict will be unlawful, Geydar Aliyev is 
inclined to grant the request of the parliamentary majority, and 
the document is expected to be signed in the next few days.

<F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt report in the "Russia in a Transcaucasian </F>
Settlement" column: "`Letters from Working People' Have Started 
Coming to Comrade Aliyev"] 
  [Text] Judging by reports from Azerbaijan, pressure on the 
opposition is mounting there. This could result in the 
dissolution of parliament and imposition of presidential rule. 
  According to the TURAN agency, recently Geydar Aliyev held a 
closed conference where it was decided to clamp down on the 
opposition. The reprisals were prompted by criticism of plans 
for a Karabakh settlement based on Russian proposals (providing 
for the introduction of Russian troops into the conflict zone). 
It is not ruled out that Aliyev will also dissolve the National 
Assembly. The day before yesterday Panakh Shakhsevenli, leader 
of the National Liberation Party, was arrested. 
  The Baku police have dispersed several rallies in the past 
few days while "letters from workers" have inundated Azerbaijan 
newspapers, demanding that "things be put in order." For 
instance, 940 refugees from Lachin wrote in AZERBAIJAN: "The 
riff-raff from the National Front are preventing you (Aliyev -- 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY) from restoring peace. Comrade Aliyev, the 
sooner you stifle them, the better. We are ready to come to 
Baku and hang them in a central square." Parliamentary 
opposition members have already felt that something was wrong: 
On pain of forced rotation, 17 deputies who walked out of the 
National Assembly in protest against the "treacherous agreement 
on Karabakh," returned to the chamber. 
  Yet all of this does not mean that Aliyev himself accepts 
the 
Russian plan: He stands by his phrase pronounced on 19 May, 
"Russian troops will never return to Azerbaijan." In this, 
incidentally, Aliyev is also supported by the United States. 
The day before yesterday the State Department said that the 
efforts by the Minsk CSCE group (its plan proposes peace-keeping 
operations only under UN and CSCE auspices) is the path that 
will lead to a durable settlement of the conflict. 
  Friction over Russian troops could be augmented by oil 
disagreements. On 23 May Aliyev received representatives of the 
oil consortium (British Petroleum, Statoil, Amoco, Pennsoil, 
Remco, Macdermott, Turkish Petrol, and Lukoil) and told them 
that some minor details have to be coordinated before signing 
the contract. He also let drop this phrase (cited according to 
the TURAN report): "As for the status of the Caspian, the sector 
which is being developed by the republic refers to Azerbaijan." 
  Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry long ago sent a 
letter to the British Foreign Office (the British BP company 
plays a leading role in the consortium), recalling that under 
the Soviet-Iranian agreements on the state border, all the 
Caspian resources in the USSR territorial waters were Soviet 
property. In the Russian Foreign Ministry's interpretation, 
after the disintegration of the Union the resources beyond the 
12-mile zone should be regarded as the "common property of the 
Caspian states." This is reason enough for Moscow's close 
attention to the oil talks.

  [Text] Moscow, May 27 (TURAN) -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry is continuing its work on a major political agreement 
concerning the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, including 
provisions for a ceasefire and discussion about the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, says the Azeri Embassy in Moscow. 
  "This agreement will be signed by the Presidents of Russia, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow," said the press-secretary of 
the Azeri Embassy in Moscow, Farhad Agamalyev. He mentioned 
that an agreement was scheduled to be signed by the end of May. 
However, the Armenian party demanded a simultaneous discussion 
of both the ceasefire and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. "Such 
a proposal contradicts Russian settlement plan. The Russian 
Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, organised a meeting between the 
defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Russia and tried to achieve 
a ceasefire [as] an important condition for the beginning of 
political dialogue at the highest level. Given the situation, 
Azeri Defense Minister Mamedov refused to sign the document and 
Russia must review the draft of the agreement", said Agamalyev. 
  Talking about the negative reaction by the Azeri opposition 
to the Russian plan, Agamalyev said that "the opposition's 
concern is clear, but one has to assess the situation 
realistically. The CSCE does not have its own military force 
and mechanism which is able to put an end to the fighting in the 
region. If we wait for the CSCE, we will further worsen the 
situation in the conflict zone and we can loose additional 
territories", said the press-secretary. 
  According to Agamalyev, the meeting between the presidents, 
where a major political agreement [as received] is due to take 
place in early June.

  [Text] Baku May 28 TASS -- Azerbaijani President Geydar 
Aliyev met with Russian deputies on Saturday to discuss 
Azerbaijani-Russian relations and conflict settlement in the 
region. 
  A group of Russian state Duma deputies are in Azerbaijan to 
study prospects for their participation in settling the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict and boosting relations between the 
two countries. 
  Nikolay Bezborodov, deputy chairman of the Defence and 
Security Committee, stressed that cessation of hostilities in 
the war zone is the major prerequisite for normalising 
relations. This opinion was shared by Vyacheslav Lyubimov, 
deputy chairman of the Committee for Agrarian Policy. He 
pointed out that the way to peace lies through negotiations and 
termination of all hostilities. 
  Aliyev praised Russia's role in settling the conflict and 
emphasised that its mediatory role will bring positive results 
only if Russian people receive true information about what is 
happening in Azerbaijan and the region. 
  He called for restoring all ties between the two countries 
which were severed after the disintegration of the Soviet Union 
in December 1991. Speaking about the position of the 
Russian-speaking population in the republic, Aliyev said that 
despite problems the general attitude toward them has always 
been favourable and good. He believes this provides a good basis 
for strengthening bilateral relations. 
  The Russian delegation also met with Azerbaijani Parliament 
Chairman Rasul Guliyev and representatives of the Russian 
community in Baku.

  [Text] Although the Chairman of Karabakh's Defense 
Committee Robert Kocharyan has confirmed his support for an 
organization comprising unrecognized states, he has noted that 
his remark to this effect carried in the newspaper IZVESTIYA has 
been misinterpreted. 
  "I believe" -- he said in an interview with Interfax on 
Thursday -- "that the nations fighting for self-determination 
and independence should combine their efforts and coordinate 
their actions with the measures undertaken by the international 
community to settle ethnic conflicts." 
  IZVESTIYA reported on May 26, with reference to Kocharyan, 
that an alliance of unrecognized states would be formed soon. 
According to the newspaper, Kocharyan expects Karabakh to be 
joined in the organiziaztion by Crimea, Abkhazia, Adjaria, South 
Ossetia, and Transdniestria. 
  He explained in this connection that "Karabakh's experience 
in attaining recognition as party to a conflict through 
persistent efforts could be instructive for other unrecognized 
states such as Abkhazia, Transdniestria, and South Ossetia." 
  Meanwhile, Aleksandr Karaman, a vice-president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic, has described such an 
alliance as feasible. In a telephone interview with Interfax on 
Thursday, he said that such a union had long ago been thought 
about and some work toward this end had been underway. 
  He recalled that the matter had been touched upon at 
top-level talks between Transdniestria, Abkhazia, and some other 
unrecognized former USSR territories. 
  "It's natural that people with similar destinies try to come 
together to solve similar problems collectively. Unity is the 
best way to prevent the repetition of tragic mistakes," Karaman 
remarked. 
  However, Vice Chairman of Transdniestria's Supreme Soviet 
Vladimir Bodnar has declared that his republic does not intend 
to join an alliance of unrecognized states. He has told an 
Interfax reporter that he knows nothing about plans to set up 
such a union. 
  "I do not understand why attempts are being made to draw us 
into an organization that we are not going to join, all the more 
so why Transnidestria is mentioned alongside with Crimea and 
Abkhazia, having a certain official status and quite ample 
powers," Bodnar said. 
  "We seek to cement ties within the CIS rather than create 
some new alliances," he added. 
  Chairman of Adjaria's Parliament Aslan Abashidze declared in 
an interview with Interfax on Thursday that there are no 
separatist trends in the republic. "It is an integral part of 
Georgia, and this blessing should be treasured," Abashidze said.

  [Text] According to a source in Azerbaijan's Defence 
Ministry, in the past 24 hours the situation in all sectors of 
the front in the Azeri-Armenian conflict area remained calm. 
Only sporadic fire exchanges took place. 
  Saturday night Azeri population centers in Terter, Geranboi 
and Agdam Regions in the north of Karabakh came under fire from 
the direction of Armenian positions. 
  According to the source, in the south-western areas of 
Azerbaijan Armenian units are engaged in burning houses and 
other building, and in destroying material and cultural values. 
  As Azerbaijan's President, Geydar Aliyev, told a delegation 
from Russia's State Duma, evidently the Armenian side is bent on 
destroying all material values in the localities it seized, 
realizing that soon it will have to leave the invaded areas.

on scenario of government activity, with specific targets and 
roles of economic institutions. Before submission, the draft 
was agreed with all these institutions. Project includes the

  To this instant, told the authors, the project has been cut

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 102 (592)] </F>
  [Text] President Snegur criticized his opponents who doubt 
the importance of having a national army, and described their 
statements as "incompetent and ill-meaning." 
  "It's not the president who needs an army, but the people 
who 
want to live and work in peace," he told the national army's 
flight brigade. 
  He said he was convinced that Moldova's sound forces 
supported the government's efforts to consolidate the state and 
strengthened the armed forces. 
  "The creation of armed forces was not a caprice, but a 
strong 
necessity, given the current complicated geopolitical situation. 
Obviously, Moldova cannot exist without armed forces capable of 
curbing encroachments on its state system, integrity and 
independence," said Snegur. He also said he favored further 
improvement in the armed forces on the basis of other countries' 
experience. 
  Speaking about the armed forces' future, Snegur said that 
the 
army must be oriented to the norms and standards of the western 
European states with solid democratic traditions. He believes, 
at the same time, that Moldova must have small but well-trained 
and well-equipped mobile armed forces capable of ensuring 
Moldova's security. He is convinced that the army must not be a 
burden for the nation. 
  He emphasized that despite the problems of the transitional 
period, the government will find ways of financing and equipping 
the army, and urged the armed forces to help the nation solve 
economic problems. 
  Speaking about the current political situation, Snegur said 
that after the multi-party parliamentary elections a cardinally 
new political situation had taken shape, an efficient deputies' 
corps came into being and the Agrarian-Democratic Party formed 
up a reformer government. All this is expected to help the 
nation overcome the economic crisis. He also said that there 
were objective difficulties which slowed down the implementation 
of a resolute economic stabilization policy and measures to 
enhance the population's living standards, above all unfavorable 
weather conditions and price liberalization. He expressed 
confidence, however, that all of these problems would be 
overcome if the government were supported and understood by the 
entire population, including servicemen.

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] May 27 TASS -- "The situation 
in Ukraine is an internal affair of that country and does not 
require outside intervention," Moldavian [Moldovan] President 
Mircea Snegur said today. "Any advice and instruction might 
result in grave consequences. Ukraine, according to its 
Constitution, is an integral state, and we hope that it will 
resolve the problems, which have cropped up through peaceful 
negotiations. We are not indifferent to how the situation 
develops in our neighbouring state with whom we maintain cordial 
relations," the Moldavian head of state said. 
  According to Mircea Snegur, the events in Ukraine belong to 
the category of those which are caused by seperatism. 
Seperatist tendencies should be condemned, since they do not 
lead to anything good. Conflicting situations in the former 
Soviet Union and in the whole world testify to this fact. I 
condemn seperatism as a phenomenon," the Moldavian leader 
emphasised. 
  The Moldavian president expressed the hope that forces 
capable of regulating problems in the Crimea would be found. 
According to him, these problems "are a result of the 
populistic activities of certain politicians, who are 
unwarrantedly claiming too much."

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- Immediately after 
the explosion of a bomb in Boris Luchik's apartment he and one 
of his bodyguards were hospitalized at the Centre of Burns from 
Odessa. In the attempt Luchik received burns covering 60 
percent of his body, his bodyguard 75 percent. Boris Luchik's 
wife, Valentina died just after the explosion. 
  Tiraspol officials gave the opinion on the local radio that 
the attempt on prosecutor's life was advantageous for Colonel 
Bergman, commander of the military division, who was earlier 
under investigation. The commander of the 14th Army declared 
that the attempt was probably organized by Vadim Shevtsov 
(Antyufeyev), as the Dniester prosecutor had authorized the 
arrest of Limanskiy, ex-deputy chairman of the Slobozia District 
Soviet.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- The International 
Conference "Central and Eastern Europe: Search for Security and 
Stability" finished yesterday in Chisinau. The participants 
examined several questions regarding the situation in the former 
Soviet countries. 
  Leader of the Moldovan Socialist Democratic Party (PSDM) 
Oazu 
Nantoi pointed out that undoubtedly Moldova is under the 
military and strategic influence of Russia and this is a 
negative factor. Nantoi criticized the government coalition of 
the Agrarians and Socialists. "In my opinion, Moldovan people 
chose on February 27th the liquidation of independence," said 
Nantoi. 
  Romanian Presidential Counselor on relations with Moldova, 
Ion Netelea, stated during the conference that the Romanian 
Government does not seek unification of the historic Romanian 
territories. Nonetheless, Netelea emphasized that Bucharest 
treats the events in 1940 as a territorial usurpation. 
"Moldova's economic policy leans mainly on Russia. Romania by 
no means intends to eliminate Russia from the Moldovan economy 
in order to take its place. However, we would like Moldova to 
have the choice to have as many options in the West as in the 
East," stated Netelea. 
  Deputy chairman of the Euro-Atlantic Centre, Vadim Malakhov, 
made a report on the parallels between the Dniester and Crimean 
conflicts. According to Malakhov, the same structures for 
setting up a break-away region were employed in Crimea as in 
Dniester. Malakhov emphasized that the creation of autonomous 
judicial organs in Crimea is alarming, as it should lead to a 
military conflict. 
  Nicolae Turtureanu, of the Moldovan Defence Ministry, stated 
that although Russia plays a negative role in the conflicts in 
the former USSR, it cannot be eliminated from the collective 
security system. "It would be better if a unique Euro-Asian 
security system would be created in the future," added 
Turtureanu.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau May 30 TASS -- The leader of the Federation 
of Independent Unions of Moldavia, Serafim Yrekyan, warned Prime 
Minister Andrei Sangheli about the possibility of mass protest 
actions as a result of the republic's extremely difficult 
economic situation. 
  The union leader said the mass protests might occur despite 
the six-month moratorium on strikes which was announced by the 
labour unions in order to give the new government the chance to 
undertake measures to overcome the crisis. The problem is that 
several unions which are hostile to the Cabinet of Ministers did 
not agree with the general decision on the moratorium. 
  The conditions are more than ripe for exciting mass unrest 
in 
Moldavia. According to the labour unions, the physical 
subsistence minimum (in May prices) is 133 lei (30 U.S. dollars) 
per month. The minimum consumer's basket, which includes 
several industrial goods in addition to the necessary food 
products, is now around 260 lei. If one compares this with the 
average monthly wage in Moldovia of about 82 lei, one can 
understand the reasons for dissatisfaction. Pensioners have it 
even worse, since the average fixed pension is only 18.8 lei per 
month. 
  But even these crumbs are not received by the population 
regularly. Following the advice of the International Monetary 
Fund, the Moldavian Government is implementing a fairly strict 
financial and credit policy and sharply limiting the currency 
supply. In light of the continuing decline in production, this 
policy has led to systematic delays in the distribution of 
salaries and pensions. 
  According to the statistics department, the government 
already owes its people about 80 million lei (20 million 
dollars). Of that sum, more than 60 million lei have not been 
given to agricultural workers, who form the backbone of the 
Moldavian economy. Experts say that these debts account for 
more than half of the salaries earned by Moldavia's four-million 
strong population in the first quarter of this year. 
  Due to fears of a social eruption, the government has had to 
put off a price increase on communal services (heating, 
electricity) three times. Local authorities would like to raise 
these prices in response to the fact that energy prices are 
constantly on the rise. The Cabinet of Ministers is now holding 
negotiations with the labour union leaders and entrepreneurs in 
the hopes of letting the steam out of the situation.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Russian Communists have made 
yet another attempt to torpedo the Russian president's six 
decrees aimed at deepening economic reforms. 
  On the whole yesterday's situation repeated. Valentin 
Martemiyanov, deputy from the faction of Communists, again 
proposed to consider "the president's anti-constitutional 
decrees". This time more deputies than yesterday voted for his 
proposal but still the number of votes was not enough to include 
this issue in the agenda of a plenary meeting of the session. 
  Representatives of the parliamentary lobby believe that the 
opposition will continue attempts to impede the implementation 
of Boris Yeltsin's decrees.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 27 May -- Kazakhstan has become the 19th 
state to join the Partnership for Peace program proposed by the 
NATO leadership. At the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on 
Friday the republic's Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev put his 
signature to the program's framework document. Kazakhstan's 
embassy in Brussels noted that the republic was the second 
nuclear state, after Ukraine, to give official support to the 
initiative put forward by the NATO countries' heads of states 
and governments. This has taken place soon after Kazakhstan's 
accession to the treaty on the non- proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and this, Almaty believes, is clear confirmation of 
Kazakhstan's firm political desire to strengthen international 
security and stability. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, K.Saudabayev expressed the 
hope that the implementation of the Partnership for Peace 
concept would make it possible to rule out the emergence of any 
grounds for new confrontation after the ending of the Cold War, 
would create real possibilities for a smooth transition to an 
atmosphere of stability, mutual trust and cooperation throughout 
the world and would ensure firm guarantees for the security and 
territorial integrity of Kazakhstan. 
  Acceding to this initiate, he stressed, opens up before the 
republic broad prospects for military-political, economic and 
technical cooperation with NATO in the sphere of setting up a 
modern army in accord with democratic principles and world 
standards, for conversion of the defense industry and for 
participation in peacekeeping operations under UN aegis. The 
minister said that the importance of Kazakhstan's accession to 
this program is that it contains a stimulus for the further 
development of economic reforms, transition to a market economy 
and the construction of a law-based democratic state. 
  Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister had a conversation with Sergio 
Balanzino, NATO Deputy Secretary General.

visit to the United States. At a news conference, Ulmanis said 
that in his talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, they discussed the issue 
of the problems of the Skrunda radar station. Special attention 
was also paid to the Russian Army's Paldiski nuclear center in 
Estonia and the Kaliningrad region as possible flash-points in 
the Baltic region. The UN secretary general agreed that the 
progress of the treaty on the Skrunda radar station must also be 
monitored by this internatonal organization. The state 
president also particularly noted that no one has reproached 
Latvia for not observing human rights, and this problem was not 
discussed. 
  It is possible that in a few years a conference of national 
leaders could be held in Riga on the problems of disarmament and 
the environment.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 May -- An attempt was made on the life of 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev on 27 May. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this from Chechnya's Press and Information 
Ministry today. 
  The attempt occurred at 1900 along the road to Groznyy when 
the motorcade in which the president was travelling passed a 
Lada car parked on the side of the road. The blast from the 
powerful car bomb killed Interior Minister Magomet Eldiyev, his 
deputy Saidali Batayev, and the driver of their car, who were 
accompanying the president. The car in which the Chechen 
president was riding was thrown 10 meters by the explosion, but 
the president was not hurt. 
  ITAR-TASS learned from Shirlai Pashayev, Chechnya's deputy 
minister for information and the press, that components of a 
remote control triggering device were found at the scene of the 
attempt. According to Pashayev, similar devices have not been 
used before on the territory of the Chechen Republic. An 
investigation is under way. 
  A decision was adopted at an emergency sitting of the 
Chechen 
Cabinet of Ministers today to declare Sunday, 29 May, a day of 
mourning.

<F P=106> [Artem Vetrov report in the "Chechnya" column: "Groznyy </F>
Accuses Russia of Organizing an Attempt on Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
Life"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday in Groznyy the Chechnya Foreign 
Ministry circulated a statement accusing Russia of elevating 
terrorism to the rank of state policy and saying that Chechnya 
"under no circumstances will resort to retaliatory terror." The 
attempt on President Dzhokhar Dudayev's life on 27 May, the 
statement stressed, was the latest in a series of terrorist acts 
conducted by Russia's special services in the three years of the 
Chechen state's existence. [passage omitted] 
  According to Chechen Press and Information Minister Movladi 
Udugov in an interview with an INTERFAX correspondent, 
preliminary examination has established that "this type of 
explosive device and its components are used for sabotage and 
terrorist purposes by the special services of the KGB, the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service, and others." On Saturday the Chechnya 
cabinet of ministers, chaired by President Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
held an emergency session and imposed a curfew in the republic. 
May 29 was declared a day of mourning in the republic. 
Yesterday the statement came out accusing Russia and asserting 
that, "taking cover behind false words about democracy, the 
Russian leadership is systematically and purposefully working to 
undermine Chechnya's sovereignty. All this is happening amid 
reports about pending talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar 
Dudayev, but no such proposals have come to the Chechnya 
leadership through official channels." According to 
representatives of the Chechnya Foreign Ministry, the true 
intentions of the Russian leadership consist in "backstage 
contacts between highly-placed Russian officials and dubious 
personalities who have compromised themselves with antinational 
actions in the Chechen Republic."

<F P=106> [Article by Oksana Boyko: "Ukraine's Integrity and </F>
Independence Must Not Be Questioned"] 
  [Text] The international community, alarmed by a 
possibility of negative development of events in the Crimea, 
voices its unequivocal support for the position expressed in a 
letter by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko sent on 20 
May to foreign ministers of other countries and leaders of 
international organizations in connection with 
anticonstitutional and illegal decisions by the Crimean Supreme 
Soviet on the peninsula's status, Yriy Sergeyev, chief of the 
Information Department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, told 
journalists. 
  On 23 May, Anatoliy Zlenko received U.S. Ambassador to 
Ukraine William Miller at his request. The American diplomat 
handed the minister a personal message from U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the 
United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's 
responsible and peaceful position regarding events in the 
Crimea. The United States, the message stressed, supports the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in its present 
borders. The United States seeks to expand and deepen relations 
with Ukraine, and would like to move forward rapidly in 
assisting Ukraine through economic encouragement programs that 
could be beneficial for the entire country, including the Crimea. 
  The Ukrainian Embassy in Germany said that the German 
Foreign 
Ministry circulated a declaration by the country's Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel that stated the following: "The Federal 
Government has been anxiously watching the recent events in the 
Crimea. Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence, 
necessary for stability and peaceful relations in Europe, must 
not be questioned. The Federal Government hopes that all 
interested political forces are aware of the meaning of 
fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the 
unconditional need to comply with those obligations." 
  A declaration by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas 
noted that Lithuania would welcome the earliest possible 
settlement of the situation that has taken shape in the Crimea 
based on the principles of international law. He expressed his 
hope that the Crimean peninsula will not become a source of 
danger and instability, putting in jeopardy the security of the 
region and the entire continent. 
  Iwo Byczewski, Polish deputy foreign minister, expressed his 
understanding of the Ukrainian position and noted that the 
situation in the Crimea should be solved only by peaceful means. 
  Martinsh Virsis, a parliamentary secretary at the Latvian 
Foreign Ministry, said he understands Ukraine's anxiety over the 
source of destabilization in the Crimea, and assured that Latvia 
supports Kiev's position based on generally accepted principles 
of international law. 
  Concern is heard in messages received from Slovakia and 
Moldova. Moldova, which knows particularly well what separatism 
is all about, understands Ukrainian efforts to create a coherent 
state and will support those efforts, the Moldovan deputy 
foreign minister stated. Moldova also offered to create some 
kind of declaration on preventing separatism along with Ukraine 
and Georgia. 
  Practically all states responded to the letter from official 
Kiev. The Crimean issue has recently attracted much attention 
from the foreign media. Many publications understand the 
current situation and express their concerns. Some draw 
parallels with the beginning of the Yugoslav conflict, others of 
Karabakh, Sukhumi, the Dniester region (the command of the Black 
Sea Fleet and the 14th Army), and so on. Some Russian media 
claim that the Crimean situation is instigated by Kiev which 
wants to use it as a tool to cancel presidential elections in 
Ukraine. On the other hand, Polish media point to some of their 
Russian colleagues, particularly from the Ostankino channel, 
whose coverage of Crimean events provokes instability on the 
peninsula.

  [Text] In accordance with agreements, from May 30 Russia 
will no longer have strategic missiles aimed at the U.S. and 
Britain, Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Missile Troops, 
Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev told Interfax today. 
  He repeated that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton had reached an agreement to this effect 
on January 14, 1994. Great Britain joined this document on 
February 15. 
  By May 30 the U.S. and Great Britain must also change the 
flight task of their strategic nuclear missiles formerly aimed 
at Russian territory. However, the Strategic Missile Troops 
Chief Headquarter has not as yet received any confirmation that 
this has been carried out, Sergeyev said. 
  Sergeyev emphasized that now Russian nuclear missiles had no 
particular target. He added that these measures had increased 
the level of nuclear safety. Even if someone tries to carry out 
a non- authorized launch, strategic missiles will not fly since 
they have no flight program, Sergeyev stated.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- In keeping with the provisions 
of the Moscow declaration signed by the presidents of Russia and 
the United States on January 14, 1994 and the joint statement by 
the Russian president and the British prime minister of February 
15, 1994, the leaders of the three countries have adopted a 
decision to issue the necessary orders to make sure that by May 
30, 1994 their strategic nuclear missiles are not aimed against 
each other. 
  A statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry on 
Monday said that Russia has already complied with this agreement 
and day- to-day control of the Russian nuclear forces is carried 
out on the basis of the understanding that the U.S. and Britain 
are not Russia's enemies. 
  The move is expected to strengthen international security 
and 
corresponds the new relations of strategic partnership between 
the three countries and their practical cooperation in the 
military and political sphere, the statement said. 
  The Russian side is also guided by the desire to create a 
more favourable climate for the process of nuclear disarmament 
to involve the whole world and promote the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and total ban on nuclear testing. 
  Russia proceeds from the understanding that this important 
measure will open up the way for further bilateral and 
multilateral steps to promote mutual trust, stability and 
predictability of strategic nuclear forces, the statement said. 
It expressed the hope that other nuclear countries will follow 
suit.

  [Text] While Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station and in the town of Slavutich, 
the subjects of political instability in the Crimea and economic 
reform, particularly rumors about the introduction of the new 
Ukrainian currency, the hryvna, were raised during numerous 
meetings between Kravchuk and the station's employees and 
Slavutich residents. Kravchuk set forth his position on this at 
the news conference that took place at Slavutich yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] I hope that sobriety will come 
to those people who have got it into their heads that they can 
do anything, while disregarding, first, Ukraine's laws and 
Constitution, disregarding even the established principles of 
the international community, which has set this highest line for 
states, which is integrity, inviolability of borders, and 
sovereignty. They thought Ukraine would continue to tolerate, 
to close its eyes, while they, being guided by, say, ambitions, 
act and do whatever they feel like. 
  We said that you have now reached that red line, and once 
you 
have gone past it we will act severely, resolutely, and 
consistently within the framework of the constitutional system. 
For our part, there is no other course. But if the other side 
also acts equivalently and appropriately, then we will resolve 
all issues in a peaceful, legislative way. If someone should 
want to work using muscle power or pressure, then he should know 
that Ukraine has sufficient forces to make safe -- I am using 
the absolutely exact words -- those who resort to such 
provocative and unlawful actions, which violate all world 
principles, including the principles of goodneighborliness with 
Russia. 
  I want to say that no one does more harm now to our friendly 
partnership relations with Russia, which are and will be the 
determining factor in spite of everything, as the Crimean 
leadership does; no one does more harm. Because in words, for 
people to see, they shout they want to become, so to speak, a 
bridge between Ukraine and Russia; but in reality they are 
always laying mines underneath this bridge, some consciously, 
others because they do not know any other way to resolve in a 
civilized manner except for one way -- rallies, slogans, and 
irresponsibility. I call on everyone -- as you have put this 
question -- to be guided by the Constitution, normative acts, 
and the principles drawn up by the UN, the CSCE, and other 
international organizations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, another 
increase in the exchange rate of the American dollar has 
occurred in the last few days, which was caused by more rumors 
of the introduction of the hryvna. And so, what prospects do we 
have regarding the introduction of a national currency? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, first, the introduction of the hryvna is 
not 
some kind of rumor. We stated long ago that we are preparing to 
introduce our own national currency. To do this we need the 
appropriate domestic conditions and the appropriate external 
assistance. I have often stressed this. 
  The second thing is that we are not going to, and I am 
saying 
this again and ask you to pass it on, make the introduction of 
the hryvna into some kind of secret. When this decision is 
taken, it will be taken openly, publicly. All of the mechanisms 
will be set forth to the people. Everything will be set forth 
to the people through the Supreme Council, through the mass 
media. It will not be as has happened before: You get up on 
Thursday and already you have different money and different 
prices. This will not happen this time. One can calm down. 
  We wanted to know what money remains in the banks now, how 
much money there is in circulation now, how many notes, so that 
we know what we have, how much and what exchange there is, what 
the relationship is. And the National Bank and government sent 
an appropriate letter to the localities. This is a normal 
phenomenon when the state wants to know what it has. And again 
people say, oh, they now want to know (?how much money there 
is), they are going to introduce the hryvna. 
  Believe me, there is not going to be a cavalry attack here. 
It will be done in a civilized way, consistently, openly 
...[recording abruptly ends]

  [Text] Moscow May 27 ITAR-TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
has endorsed the federal programme for stepping up the struggle 
against crime in the Russian Federation in 1994-1995. 
  The presidential decree, circulated by the president's press 
service, instructs the government to ensure the funding of the 
program. The leaders of the ministries and departments charged 
with implementing the program are warned about their personal 
responsibility for the timely fulfillment of the programme. 
  The president advised the State Duma to consider without 
delay the bills initiated by the president and the government 
for the purpose of upgrading the struggle against crime, 
promoting new legislation and improving the activity of the 
law-enforcement agencies. 
  The five-page decree lists measures designed to curb the 
criminal activity in the country. The formations and military 
units subordinate to the Interior Ministry will be reinforced by 
52 thousand men. The rights of the police will be expanded and 
it will be given the right to inspect buildings of enterprises 
and offices, regardless of ownership, if criminal activity in 
them is reported. 
  The rules for the use of arms by the employees of the 
law-enforcement agencies in the line of duty will be revised, 
and special police units will be established to accompany long 
distance and suburban trains. 
  The secretary of the National Security Council of the 
Russian 
Federation, Oleg Lobov, is entrusted with the supervision over 
the fulfilment of the federal programme.

"Fight Against Crime Will Be Reinforced"] 
  [Text] On 24 May, by an edict, the Russian Federation 
president ratified the federal program for reinforcing the fight 
against crime for 1994-1995, which had earlier been examined and 
approved by the Security Council. 
  It was elaborated by an interdepartmental working group at 
the Security Council with the participation of specialists from 
ministries and departments, leading criminologists, and 
practical workers in law enforcement organs. The process of the 
formation of a program was accompanied by a broad discussion of 
its provisions both in the center and in the regions. Over 
1,000 proposals were submitted to the Security Council. 
  The program is based on Russia's existing legislation. It 
takes into consideration our state's international-legal 
commitments, the results of a comprehensive analysis of the 
state and forecasting of the development of crime, and domestic 
and foreign experience of the elaboration and implementation of 
programs for fighting against it. 
  The implementation of the program presupposes the pooling of 
the efforts of law enforcement organs and other state 
institutions and the whole of society. It presupposes the 
interlinking of economic, political, legal, educational, 
organizational, and other measures while relying on giving 
consideration to and organically combining the interests of the 
citizen and society. 
  The program defines the following spheres as the most 
important ones in fighting against crime: the formation of 
legislative and organizational-legal principles; preventive 
measures against crimes; the fight against crimes against the 
life, health, and property of citizens; the fight against 
malfeasance and economic and organized crime; the fight against 
crime in the Armed Forces; the development of international 
cooperation in the sphere of the fight against crime; the 
improvement of resources, including cadre, scientific, and 
information backup for the fight against crime. 
  The edict of the Russian Federation president envisages 
concrete measures for the implementation of the federal program.

  [Text] On 25 May, information sources of Abkhaz leader 
Vladislav Ardzinba's regime spread a new falsehood through 
Russian press and television. It claimed that the Georgian side 
had opened artillery fire on Abkhaz positions in the Dali Gorge 
and had even gone into attack. In reality, the Abkhaz 
separatists had subjected Georgian villages in the gorge to 
howitzer and mortar fire. 
  In this connection, the Ministry of Defense of Georgia 
states 
that this is another attempt by the Abkhaz junta to falsify the 
truth, present itself as a victim of aggression and conceal its 
crimes against the local Georgian population. This method has 
always been used by the Abkhaz side as a means of avoiding 
responsibility for the escalation of military confrontation and 
the wrecking of peace talks. The Ardzinba regime has failed to 
reconcile itself to the idea that the signing of the agreement 
in Moscow may become the first stage in the restoration of the 
territorial integrity of Georgia and is using any means to 
prevent its implementation. 
  The Georgian Ministry of Defense states that unless the 
self-styled regime in Abkhazia stops its provocations against 
Georgian civilians -- thereby thwarting all attempts by the 
Georgian Government to achieve stability in the region by 
peaceful means -- the Georgian Government will be left with no 
other way to solve the problem of Abkhazia but to take up arms 
to (defend) the country's territorial integrity.

  [Text] The Russian State Duma will recommend that the 
government continue the talks with the CIS states aimed at 
concluding an international treaty on a single external border 
for the CIS and on its joint defense on a treaty basis. The 
State Duma will also demand that the Russian Government take 
measures in order to put an end to any uncontrolled and illegal 
traffic of goods through the border, especially to the Baltic 
states and to transferring financial funds from Russia to 
foreign banks. This was stated in the draft resolution which is 
expected to be adopted as a result of the closed parliamentary 
hearings in the State Duma on the Russian state borders today. 
  The draft resolution has been worked out by the 
parliamentary 
Committee on Geo-Politics (led by Viktor Ustinov from the 
faction of the Liberal Democratic Party). It also recommends 
that the government prevent uncontrolled traffic of foreigners 
and persons without citizenship to Russia, especially those from 
China and Korea, and deport all foreigners and persons without 
citizenship illegally staying on Russian territory. 
  In accordance with the draft resolution, the Duma Committees 
on Geo-Politics and International Affairs are expected to set up 
working groups which will also examine the possible conclusion 
of a peace treaty with Japan taking into consideration the 
declaration of 1956 on the Shikotan and Habomai islands. 
  There will also be established working groups in order to 
make the appropriate preparations for ratification of the UN 
Convention on Maritime Law of 1982 and in order to assess the 
agreements between the USSR and the U.S.A. on the line of 
delimitation of maritime space.

retired. The remaining 120 Russian staff officers will be 
supplemented by 120 officers from the CIS-states' armed forces. 
  Russian military men who have gone through the General Staff 
school are not forming a high opinion about the newly arriving

cooperation has begun to fulfill its first mission -- to form 
the military part of a concept of military security of... Russia.

rubric: "Unified Eurasian Antimonopoly Space Being Formed"] 
  [Text] Unfair competition will soon be unable to hide 
behind the picket fence of the national borders of former 
republics of the USSR and the defunct CEMA [Council for 
Ecoonomic Mutual Assistance]: Participants in a conference of 
the leaders of antimonopoly organs of CIS countries, Latvia, 
Lithuania, and countries of Eastern Europe -- Bulgaria, Poland, 
Slovakia, and the Czech Republic -- have agreed to exchange, 
within one month, antimonopoly normative acts, laws and draft 
laws. 
  The Kiev conference, in which chiefs of the CIS Executive 
Secretariat took part, ended late last week. Having compared 
notes on antimonopoly activities, the participants decided to 
sum up their experience and, having further set up special 
working groups to coordinate efforts in building a 
competition-based economy for their countries, to standardize 
their antimonopoly laws. It was also decided to initiate an 
exchange of information on the state of commodity markets and 
the results of scientific research work and to exchange 
specialists in the field of antimonopoly activity. 
  The brunt of the coordination of this work falls on the 
interstate CIS Council for Antimonopoly Policy, whose second 
sitting took place within the Kiev meeting framework. Among 
other things, it worked out proposals to the Executive Committee 
and the CIS Interparliamentary CIS Assembly on harmonization of 
antimonopoly laws within the framework of the Treaty on the 
Conduct of a Concerted Antimonopoly Policy signed by the CIS 
heads of government in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat] in December 1993. 
Bulgaria wanted to accede to the treaty; participants in the 
conference supported its initiative on creating an interstate 
association on competition policy.

Parties of States Formed on the Territory of the USSR on the 
Political and Socioeconomic Situation in States on the Territory 
of the USSR and the Tasks of Strengthening the Unity of 
Communists," signed by party representatives in Moscow on 22 May 
1994: "Common Goals"] 
  [Text] A meeting of delegations of communist parties of 
states formed on the territory of the USSR and a delegation of 
the Council of the Union of Communist Parties-CPSU [UCP-CPSU] 
was held in Moscow 21-22 May 1994. 
  An exchange of opinions was held on the political and 
socioeconomic situation in the states on the territory of the 
USSR and on further steps to strengthen the unity of the 
communist movement. 
  The participants in the meeting note that the years since 
the 
criminal destruction of the USSR -- contrary to the will of the 
peoples -- have confirmed the correctness of the fundamental 
assessments of the congresses of the communist parties of the 
states and of the conclusions of the 29th CPSU Congress. The 
pursuit of sovereignty has checked the economic development of 
all the states, while the economic reforms being pursued are a 
mere screen for a tiny section of the population to appropriate 
the national wealth created by generations of Soviet people. 
  The collapse of the Union, the plundering of national 
wealth, 
and the emergence of unbridled nationalism have split the Soviet 
people up into national compartments and divided them into a 
handful of rich and millions of poor. All this has resulted in 
economic catastrophe and a drastic worsening of ethnic and 
social conflicts. The economic damage inflicted on the Soviet 
people and our common Homeland is five times greater than that 
caused during all the years of war against fascist Germany. 
Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people have perished in ethnic 
wars and millions have become refugees or jobless, doomed to 
suffer misery and poverty. 
  The lofty achievements of our national culture are being 
displaced by Western mass culture, with its cult of money and 
violence. Free medical care and education are being replaced by 
paid services, which are becoming beyond the means of an 
ever-increasing number of citizens. Millions of people waiting 
in line for housing or actually homeless are losing hope of 
obtaining accommodations. Only the death rate, corruption, and 
criminality are on the increase. The death rate exceeds the 
birth rate in the majority of former Union republics. Three to 
four times as many people die each year at the hands of 
criminals than during the 10 years of the Afghan War. 
  In these conditions the peoples of the states are beginning 
to realize the antipeople nature of the ruling regimes and to 
pin their hopes on replacing them by establishing people's power 
based on an upsurge of the communist movement and progressive 
left-wing forces. 
  The states' party organizations have drawn the requisite 
lessons from their heavy defeat. They have cleared out the 
traitors, careerists, and timeservers. The majority of the 
states' Communist Parties are completing their organizational 
formation and are waging a hard-hitting campaign on behalf of 
the interests of workers, the working peasantry, and the 
people's intelligentsia. 
  The common goals of the states' communist parties are as 
follows: 

  -  service to the working people; 
  -  socialism and communism as 
the historic future of mankind, freedom and social equality, 
collectivism, social justice, and genuine humanity; 
  -  the 
achievement, defense, and strengthening of the political power 
of working people in the form of soviets and the development of 
socialist democracy and broad self-management by the 
people; 
  -  resistance to the restoration of capitalism and the 
resumption of a socialist path of development in the republics 
of the USSR -- which most fully meets working people's social 
needs; 
  -  the ending of ethnic conflicts and the prevention of 
civil wars on the territory of the USSR; 
  -  the restoration of the 
USSR as a voluntary association of sovereign states based on the 
principles of Soviet patriotism, internationalism, the 
fraternity of the peoples, and respect for national traditions 
in accordance with the decision of the nationwide referendum of 
17 March 1991, when three-quarters of the adult population of 
the country expressed itself in favor of retaining the USSR; 
  -  the 
reconstitution of single republic Communist Parties and their 
amalgamation as the USSR is restored into a single Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union. 


    In defining their political strategy and tactics the parties 
are guided by Marxist-Leninist teaching and materialist 
dialectics in their creative development and underpinned by 
analysis of the specific historical situation and the 
achievements of national and world science and culture. 
  The parties employ both parliamentary and nonparliamentary 
means of political struggle within the bounds of existing 
legislation to achieve their set goals. 
  While endorsing the correctness and timeliness of the 29th 
CPSU Congress decision on the temporary reorganization of the 
CPSU into the UCP-CPSU, the participants in the meeting consider 
that the states' communist parties are, while maintaining their 
own organizational autonomy, program documents, and rules, an 
integral part of a single communist movement on the territory of 
the USSR. 
  The participants in the meeting note that certain provisions 
of the UCP-CPSU Rules and Program are out of date and do not 
take full account of the special features of the work of the 
states' communist parties in modern conditions. The conference 
instructs the UCP-CPSU Council, in conjunction with authorized 
representatives of the parties, to draft common principles 
governing programs and rules and to submit them for examination 
at the 30th UCP-CPSU Congress and other partywide forums. 
  The participants in the meeting regard the present 
coordinating conference of leaders of the communist parties of 
all the states formed on the territory of the USSR as a standing 
conference. 
  The participants in the meeting instruct all communist 
parties to concentrate their efforts on elaborating and 
theoretically validating our common goals, coordinating the 
parties' joint efforts to achieve them, propagating the 
experience of political work in labor collectives, and 
supporting and disseminating communist and opposition 
socialist-oriented mass media. 
  The participants in the meeting condemn all attempts to 
split 
the communist parties and their regional organizations and the 
creation of multiple communist centers and advise communists to 
unite in single organizations to enhance their influence among 
workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia. Parties can and 
should observe proper standards of party ethics in debating 
questions relating to different understandings of theoretical 
problems and the tactics and strategy of practical actions in 
discussions within the party. 
  The participants in the meeting urge all communists to 
campaign actively for the unity of the communist movement on the 
territory of the Soviet Union, to be resolute in defending the 
interests of working people, and to enhance the level of 
organization and party discipline. Our goals are: the Soviet 
Union, power to the soviets of working people's deputies, a 
single Communist Party, and socialism.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russian newspapers comment on 
President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan. 
  TRUD writes that "the visit can be viewed as a practical 
step 
to flesh out the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan on the 
delimitation of the spheres of competence and mutual delegation 
of powers". The newspaper emphasises the president's words that 
"this is the first such treaty. So, the Russian president shows 
special interest in how it is being carried into life." 
  ROSSIISKIYE VESTI notes that "Yeltsin began his 
familiarisation with the reform process in Tatarstan with a 
visit to the kamaz in order to decide on how the automotive 
workers can be helped". One of major sections of the kamaz -- a 
motor engine manufacturing plant -- is known to have been gutted 
out by fire on April 14, last year. "Measures to help overcome 
this problem are expected to be the basis of one of future 
economic agreements," the newspaper reports. 
  PRAVDA points out that "the Russia-Tatarstan treaty, 
undoubtedly, has opened the door for the establishment of 
constructive relations of trust between the central authority 
and regions". The newspaper quotes the Russian president as 
saying that "the treaty between Moscow and Kazan has become a 
precedent on the basis of which relations between Russia and 
Chechnya as well as between the Crimea and Ukraine could be 
settled". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA evaluates the results of the the 
president's two-day visit as follows: "Yeltsin is satisfied 
with his stay in Tatarstan. It remains to implement the 
bilateral treaty between Moscow and Kazan". 
  SEGODNYA (TODAY) newspaper carries an article headlined 
"Zhirinovskiy Repays Debts to the GMM" about a relationship 
between the Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy and the GMM trust company. The newspaper 
reproduces Zhirinovskiy's letter, addressed to Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. In the letter, Zhirinovskiy requests 
assistance in settling "relations between the GMM and financial 
agencies as well as a resumption of televised advertising on 
state-run broadcasting channels". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA runs an article in which writer Eduard 
Limonov criticises LDPR leader Zhirinovskiy. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that the MMM joint-stock 
company 
has again incurred financial losses. This time owing to an 
attack of the company's money collectors who were robbed of 
money amounting to 1,500 million roubles. "None of three 
robberies has been exposed so far. But then the MMM remains one 
of few firms which avoid businesslike contacts with the 38 
Petrovka criminal investigation department." 
  PRAVDA runs an article by retired Colonel Robert Bykov about 
Pavel Grachev in his capacity as Russia's defence minister. The 
writer of the article critically evaluates the minister's 
activities, pointing out his inconsistency. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) reports that an expedition to the 
area of the sunken nuclear-powered submarine Komsomolets is 
planned in the coming months. The submarine with two torpedoes 
is known to have met with an accident in Norwegian Sea. The 
newspaper points out that the environment can be contaminated as 
a result of the corrosion of the torpedoes, each of which 
contains 3,200 grammes of plutonium. "According to the most 
pessimistic expert forecasts, this may happen at the end of 1995 
or early in 1996".

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, chief of the Russian </F>
Federation Presidential Staff, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Chief Editor 
Valeriy Kucher; date and place not given: "Strength in 
Government Lies in the Ability to Find Compromise"] 
  [Text] [Kucher] Sergey Aleksandrovich, a broad exchange 
of opinions about cadre reshuffles in the higher echelons of 
power, which is entirely permissible in an open, civil society, 
is sometimes turned into a secret source of information and even 
a lever of influence on those processes. At various intervals, 
but on the basis of one pattern, we find out about the possible 
official prospects of certain individuals. The authorities 
sometimes call these reports rumors or provocations, or use the 
more refined word "leaks." Perhaps none of the current 
high-ranking officials is bypassed, but there is no point in 
talking about politicians who have retired. Are leaks of 
information a necessary instrument for presidential power? What 
is your attitude to this? 
  [Filatov] You have broached an important question. Because 
the spread of rumors about cadre changes in the top sphere of 
power is now virtually being turned into a system. I would even 
say that leaks of information have become an instrument of 
political power. I would stress: a weapon in political 
infighting, but by no means an attribute of presidential power. 
  The desire of any government to know how society will react 
to proposed actions by the authorities is understandable and 
explicable. A lot of civilized methods for gathering 
information at the stage of the formation of a plan or any steps 
exist for this purpose. And we know of examples where certain 
decisions were modified as a result of such a social 
verification, bided their time, or else simply never appeared. 
This is quite normal. It is another matter when nothing has 
happened and yet there is a "leak" of information.... I think 
that this method has unfortunately started being used 
extensively recently, indeed with purely opportunistic aims. 
  [Kucher] Sometimes this bears fruit.... 
  [Filatov] In that case I would talk about something else, 
something more important. Any phenomenon must be tested, to see 
whether it is to society's benefit or to its detriment. Any 
action by the authorities intensifies people's faith in them or 
else, conversely, destroys trust in them. I generally believe 
that you should be extremely careful in dealing with preliminary 
information. As for using it to selfish political ends, that is 
all the more immoral. Because when a person is schooled in this 
system of "idle" intercourse, in this lifeless pattern of work 
with him, then the authorities increasingly lose moral substance 
in his eyes. And that is terrible, because we could obtain a 
situation whereby there will be no faith in official documents. 
People will inclined to identify truth with rumor and not 
accept what is really happening. That is why I have a very 
negative attitude to immoral methods of checking people's 
reactions. 
  But we sometimes call routine procedures by the wrong name. 
For instance, a document which is intended for official use has 
to be circulated. An ordinary aspect of work is thus sometimes 
set up as an enforced leak of information. Immunity is 
willy-nilly built up in respect of the actual term "leak." No 
wonder that the sense of rejection is weakened in a real "leak" 
which plays the role of political intrigue. 
  There is also another side to the question. Those about 
whom the rumors are being spread must also be protected. This is 
not just a question of the fact that people are very vulnerable 
and handle rumors about themselves very badly. Besides, I see 
the authorities' ability to protect a person against lies as a 
display of their moral character. Although, of course, it is 
equally dangerous for society to create an imaginary aura of 
infallibility and sanctity around officials. 
  [Kucher] Does it not seem to you that similar outlines can 
been seen in almost all subjects concerning recent cadre policy? 
It works out that the change of cadres comes first, and then a 
belated and vague explanation of the true reasons for it. So 
only one conclusion tends to suggest itself willy-nilly: It 
means that some kind of bureaucratic games are going on here, 
which have nothing to do with state interests. And since that 
is the case, it looks as though the authorities are losing touch 
with the people.... 
  [Filatov] The first thing that I would like to stress is 
that cadre policy, generally speaking, is only just beginning to 
take shape. The president has created a Cadre Policy Council. 
It includes representatives of all the structures which have a 
direct bearing on this matter. There are three commissions, two 
of which are already working. One of them is headed by Justice 
Minister Yu.Kh. Kalmykov. This commission puts forward 
candidacies for judges, whom the president either appoints 
himself or presents to the Federation Council. The second 
commission examines the possible award of military ranks and 
posts. It is led by presidential aide Yu. Baturin. There is 
also a third commission, which has not started working yet: Its 
duties include selecting candidates for top official posts in 
various Russian missions abroad -- excluding ambassadors, since 
they are appointed by the president as a result of consultations 
with the Federal Assembly. 
  In this way, the first step has been taken toward moving the 
problem of appointing cadres in the top echelon of power out of 
the direct influence of bureaucratic structures. And I think 
that, if the process of deregulating cadre appointments and 
reshuffles proceeds along a normal path, then suspicions will be 
removed. 
  I will say frankly that a colossal shortage of cadres is to 
be perceived in the country, particularly for the leading 
components of the administration. After all, you can see for 
yourselves that the same people are revolving in the orbit of 
power all the time. It looks as though we cannot manage without 
any serious or profound training of cadres capable of operating 
in the new market conditions. This problem is being widely 
discussed in the Kremlin right now. If we have a good reserve 
and a normal system for training cadres, particularly for the 
top leadership personnel, then, no doubt, the basis for the 
dramatic situations which we frequently come up against will 
disappear. 
  [Kucher] How do you explain the rather frequent change of 
characters in the official political arena? A shortage of 
cadres? 
  [Filatov] Not only that. Society's socioeconomic morale and 
the results of internecine struggle among the political forces 
also affect the frequency of cadre changes. That is precisely 
what makes the cadre structure in the state unstable. Actually, 
I believe that this is a temporary phenomenon in the current 
conditions, because it is sometimes possible to reach 
compromises by means of cadre reshuffles. And a compromise in 
politics makes it possible to ease tension in society and leads 
to a stabilization in the situation. 
  How it is reached is another matter. Or, more precisely, how 
it is greeted in certain political circles. Not everyone has 
fully understood and accepted the presidential powers in terms 
of cadre policy. His opportunities are determined by the 
Constitution. But some people would like to see this as an 
excessive strengthening of personal power. The president does 
have, for example, the right to release or appoint a government 
member on the premier's submission. But he also has the right 
to appoint a person by his own decision to a leading post even 
if he is not a government member. It is particularly pointless 
to dramatize the situation when the president releases, moves, 
or dismisses someone from service, sometimes for reasons known 
only to himself. 
  Sometimes people lose sight of the fact that, when the 
people 
elected the president, they voted not just for the personality 
of the politician but also the statesman, who has a program 
which must be implemented. That is why the key posts in the 
president's entourage must be occupied by people who have the 
same political orientation as him. If someone in that team is 
out of step with the chosen aim, makes mistakes, gets confused, 
or betrays it -- this has also happened -- then naturally the 
president parts company with him. It is another matter when a 
person only finds out about a decision concerning his future 
from a newspaper or radio report. But here the blame is to be 
laid at the door of those charged with reporting on adopted 
decisions before they are announced, and that includes me. 
  [Kucher] Does President Boris Yeltsin need obedient 
officials to carry things out or active people with a clearly 
defined commitment? 
  [Filatov] The president forms the cadre policy of the 
Russian state, proceeding on the basis that this is a 
qualitatively different state. So the top stratum of 
administrators must be qualitatively different. Only 
professionals can work in certain sections, and in certain 
places professionalism must be supplemented by persons with a 
clear-cut political orientation. Policy is determined by the 
president, which means that those who help him to do this and 
are directly in his team, are also political figures. 
  [Kucher] Are we to hope that there will no longer be a place 
for favorites in the presidential team?... What principles lie 
at the heart of the new line in cadre policy? 
  [Filatov] First of all, professionalism. Second, the 
capability for long-term hard work, and, naturally, solidarity 
with the president's line. 
  [Kucher] So what about independence of thought? 
  [Filatov] Yes, that too. Until a decision is adopted, you 
can discuss and analyze. Apart from the Staff apparatus, the 
president has various formations: the Presidential Council, the 
Security Council, the Expert Analytical Council, this Council 
for Cadre Policy, and the recently formed Council for Social 
Policy. A number of commissions are in operation. The 
president does not work alone but is surrounded by an 
intellectual and professional elite. That is where arguments go 
on, views collide, a concept of reform is elaborated. Believe 
me, the people there are not all of the same opinion. But it is 
only the president who adopts a decision, taking all opinions 
and approaches into account. 
  [Kucher] Let us take the Sergey Shakhray case. I would like 
to know how the new principles of cadre policy have operated 
with respect to him. 
  [Filatov] I do not want to talk about that subject for 
ethical reasons. 
  [Kucher] The qualities of the cadre corps surrounding the 
president in many respects leave their mark on the mechanism for 
elaborating presidential decisions. Are there any rules 
according to which their elaboration proceeds? 
  [Filatov] The process of preparing a decision does not 
proceed according to one technological diagram. A plan of 
action is drawn up. The government proposes something, and 
something else comes from the State-Legal Administration as well 
as the president's assistants and the ministries and 
departments. The concept of future documents must be discussed 
by the interested parties, and sometimes proceeds directly from 
Boris Nikolayevich. He is very active both at the moment when 
the document comes into being and in the period when it is to be 
signed. 
  [Kucher] The opinion exists in society that the president's 
reaction to topical events in the country is sometimes belated 
and sometimes not commensurate with their significance.... 
  [Filatov] If there is such an opinion, than we must listen 
to it. However, I believe that the president's reaction does 
correspond to the degree of the event's importance. In the 
final analysis it is he who decides how to do this -- in writing 
or orally -- and when to react, who should speak -- the press 
secretary, the foreign minister, the president himself, or a 
particular state employee. So that strictly speaking from the 
viewpoint of reacting to events which are generally significant 
to the country I believe that everything is in order here. 
Maybe the content of such information is not always detailed, 
but that is another matter. 
  [Kucher] There is no presidential party in the country at 
the moment, and at the same time we know of unsuccessful 
attempts to create one. I remember the president's recent 
statement at the democratic forum, to the effect that if such a 
party were to be created, he would be the first to join it... 
What is the state of affairs in this sphere at the moment? 
  [Filatov] I think that a party should be created. We are 
living in an excessively dynamic situation, whereby various 
movements and blocs are simply not managing to develop a normal 
party structure and party activity, but elections have to be 
held. Of course we need such a party.... This question is being 
raised by many imminent politicians and public figures. 
  [Kucher] What kind of a party will it be? 
  [Filatov] Most likely it will correspond to the type of 
state we are building. And reflect the style of its development 
and its aim. It must be a social democratic party. In any 
case, this is what determines the president's activity, it seems 
to me. At least the years of his struggle against the communist 
ideology draw a picture of a social democratic type of state. 
That is precisely what is enshrined in the new Constitution -- 
a federative, democratic, rule-of-law, social state. 
  [Kucher] Can you see a place for yourself in the state 
party? 
  [Filatov] I would not refuse to support such a party or be 
in it. 
  [Kucher] Sergey Aleksandrovich, I ask everyone I talk to 
this question, and I would like to know your opinion: What are 
we building here? 
  [Filatov] It seems to me that we do not have to attach any 
kind of ideological adjective to our state. Then everything 
falls into place. Sometimes people say: There is no common 
idea in the country, no ideology of reform. That is not true. 
  We want to our state to be democratic. Have we achieved 
this? Not at the moment. But we have freely elected the 
president and the Federal Assembly. Local self-government is 
being created. 
  We are fighting for freedom of information and freedom of 
the 
press. And you cannot say that there has been no success in 
this. The world recognizes the fact. 
  And take our courts. They have already started protecting 
constitutional human rights, although of course we are still at 
the beginning of the path and through force of momentum are 
still doing a lot of things in an administrative way, responding 
to people's letters and complaints. 
  We are in favor of laws' taking precedence over the will of 
officials. Here too there is no end of work to be done. In a 
normal rule-of-law state several thousand normative acts are in 
operation, but here, as I see it, we do not even have one 
thousand yet. At the moment a lot depends on the personality of 
the administrator, his abilities and talent to predict and solve 
problems. That is why the slogan "cadres determine everything" 
exists at the moment. 
  Are the contours of the future Russian state taking shape? 
Of course they are. The individual and his rights are of 
paramount importance in the new Constitution. Can we fully 
ensure these rights today? Not at the moment. But we are 
getting increasingly close to being called a civilized state in 
which the individual is the main figure, protected by all the 
attributes of a democratic state. People should own property 
and live peacefully amid wealth. That is how it should be. And 
will be! 
  [Kucher] What, in your opinion, is the state obliged to do 
today for society? 
  [Filatov] Preserve it, and prevent a reduction in the level 
of consumption. The figures show the monstrous economic 
position in which our state finds itself today. Nevertheless, 
the consumption of food products is a main factor. 
  Admittedly, we are all demanding various things from the 
state through force of momentum. We are still proceeding as if 
on a knife edge, and we have to go down the path worthily, so as 
not to fall into the abyss. It seems to me that, during this 
period, all groups should give up persistently trying to obtain 
various funds and preferential conditions for transient benefits. 
  [Kucher] They will not agree to that. Or they will pretend 
to agree. 
  [Filatov] But then there will be no results. If you aim to 
keep the fall in production at a level of 25 percent by the end 
of the year, and inflation at no more than 10 percent, then this 
can be achieved only by giving up lobbying activities. Accord 
in society is, after all, not just a subject for discussion by 
political scientists or journalists. Accord has an economic 
foundation. Accord requires restrictions, of a financial nature 
too. 
  [Kucher] Do you really believe in the idea of accord? 
  [Filatov] I believe in the idea of accord very strongly. I 
think that our state will not be able to get out of the crisis 
situation in which it finds itself without becoming aware of the 
need for sociopolitical conciliation. 
  Stressing the importance of the Social Accord Treaty, the 
president noted that we have not had such a thing in almost 80 
years. For eight decades our country lived in a regime of civil 
war, when part of society overtly or covertly destroyed the 
rest. No other country, with the possible exception of fascist 
Germany, has allowed such a scale of destruction of its own 
citizens as we permitted to happen. Hence the conclusion that 
we must give up Bolshevik methods of solving civil conflicts 
once and for all. But what the aggressively minded opposition 
is now trying to do constitutes Bolshevik tactics; and, whether 
we like it or not, this will inevitably lead to violence. Yet 
we have no right to fight. The treaty is the path to peace in 
Russian society. 
  [Kucher] That formula is too general.... 
  [Filatov] You see, there are a lot of laws missing in our 
society, and that is why it is, so to speak, naked and 
defenseless in the face of confrontation and violence. Until 
society is saturated with legal norms, accord is needed as a 
method of settling conflicts. As an intermediate link in peace. 
It will be difficult for us to get out of the crisis. Critical 
moments, notably connected with the refusal to support 
loss-making enterprises, cannot be ruled out. And the problem 
of unemployment arises here. Of course, you can shout that this 
is a crime, that the people have been reduced to penury. 
Certain speculative politicians who are pursuing power may play 
on this. But the problems nevertheless need to be solved, and 
they need to be solved economically, partly through constructive 
dialogue, that is, on the basis of the peaceful manifestation of 
the professional opinion of the majority. That is the substance 
of the accord idea.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- A general demographic scheme 
for Russia's territories, determining the main tendencies for 
the development of the country's urban and rural communities and 
separate regions, stipulating versions for accommodating 
refugees, displaced persons, families of servicemen, migrants 
from the north, and outlining ways to officially regulate those 
processes in conditions of a market economy, was discussed and 
approved today by an expert council under the Russian president. 
  As noted by Aleksandr Krivov, vice-chairman of the Russian 
State Building Committee, the key task, indicated in the 
document, is to draw up a concept and a long-term policy for 
settling people on Russia's vast territories and to elaborate 
concrete proposals for this purpose. 
  The pivotal idea of the general scheme is to elaborate a 
basic settlement pattern and to site and form urban 
conglomerations, constituting the key form of contemporary and 
future distribution of the Russian population. They are to be 
provided with a powerful infrastructure, ensuring modern 
transport and communication services, information facilities, 
and the ecological safety of a given district. 
  The mid-Russian, south Siberia and Pacific regions are 
indicated as the priority settlement areas. Leningrad, Pskov, 
Novgorod, Tver, Yaroslavl, Kostroma and Vologda regions, as well 
as the middle belt of Russia and the Urals, Siberia, and the Far 
East are earmarked for the settlement of refugees from the 
republics of the former Soviet Union, for the families of 
servicemen and resettlers from the north, the number of which is 
expected to reach 5.5-8 million people by the year 2000. 
  A package of federal programmes is to be drawn up on the 
basis of this document, envisaging the development of small and 
medium-size towns, revival of the Russian countryside, revival 
and development of the mid-Russian region, and the accommodation 
of migrants. The expert council moved to "determine the status 
of the general scheme as a regularly amended prognosis-type 
document", to approve the draft's concept, to set up an 
inter-departmental commission for shape Russia's town-building 
policy and to draw up a draft resolution of the Russian 
Government "On the main directions of the state town-building 
and settlement policy in the Russian Federation".

  [Text] Radical opposition leaders are pulling a propaganda 
stunt when they promise an early change of government, a senior 
official in President Boris Yeltsin's headquarters told Interfax 
Tuesday. 
  He did not think that former vice-president Aleksandr 
Rutskoy's signature collection campaign for early presidential 
elections would be a success. The official believed that even 
if Rutskoy's supporters collect the one million signatures 
required to hold a referendum on the issue, neither the State 
Duma nor the Constitutional Court would have a constitutional 
case to call a referendum. 
  Speaking on the recent meeting of the Accord in the Name of 
Russia council he said that friction between Rutskoy and 
Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, members of the council, was 
to be expected. 
  Still, he thought it possible that even though Zyuganov was 
a 
much more intelligent statement than Rutskoy, he might ally with 
the latter temporarily in order to change the government. 
  The official said it was strange that former foreign trade 
minister Sergey Glazyev, a Democratic party deputy in the Duma, 
had joined a grouping whose goal was to kindle the fires of 
discontent rather than looking for a constructive alternative to 
what the government was doing.

  [Text] The leader of the Russian Pan-National Union, State 
Duma deputy Sergey Baburin, has said that his movement has no 
intention of supporting Russia's former vice-president, 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, in the forthcoming presidential elections. 
  Addressing the residents of Novosibirsk on Tuesday, Baburin 
said: "Rutskoy is the leader of Russia's nationalist movement 
only in the pages of the press." According to him, in the wake 
of last October's events Rutskoy displayed his unsuitability as 
a political leader and strategist. 
  Baburin came to Novosibirsk to inaugurate a branch of his 
movement on Monday. According to him, this is the 50th 
affiliation to the Russian Pan-National Union. "The 
establishment of a mass of regional branches across Russia is 
linked first of all with our preparations for the upcoming 
presidential elections," he stressed. 
  During the election campaign his movement, Baburin added, 
will be ready to cooperate with all patriotic-minded 
organizations, except the Liberal Democratic Party. With 
reference to the possible candidacy to be backed by the Union 
and by other nationalist organizations he said that it has not 
yet been determined. 
  In comments on developments in and around the Crimea Baburin 
told Interfax that Russia must give the Crimea military aid by 
sending troops there. According to him, the deployment of 
Russian troops alone will induce Ukraine to "lower its ambitions 
toward the people of the Crimea and induce the Ukrainian 
government to enter into negotiations on the situation on the 
peninsula."

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Kuzin report: "Two-Thirds of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA </F>
Journalists Left Jobless"] 
  [Text] As of today they have been dismissed in connection 
with the editorial office reorganization launched by Editor 
Natalya Polezhayeva with the support of the founder -- the 
Russian Government. 
  It all started with the October events, after which 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the organ of the mutinous Supreme Soviet, 
was left without an owner. While the collective was thinking 
about the sponsorship issue and gathering the necessary 
documents together, the government got busy and ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA got a new owner. He who pays the piper calls the tune. 
  The first and quite obvious change (to prevent the old 
comrade Ruslan Imranovich from remaining in charge) was the 
appearance of a new editor -- Natalya Polezhayeva, whose tough 
management style was not welcomed by many staffers. 
  The new ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Editorial Office Charter, adopted 
in December at a general meeting of the collective, laid down 
that the newspaper would be a state enterprise but would 
subsequently be floated. But two months later the government 
gave the "go-ahead" to a version of the document absolutely 
unknown to ordinary staffers, under which the editorial office 
won the status of a corporate body. Under the Law on the Mass 
Media such a charter can only be adopted by a journalists' 
collective by a simple majority. But the journalists learned of 
the charter after it had already been ratified. 
  In an interview with KOMMERSANT, Pavel Gurin, ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA general director, blamed the government for this 
violation. But that explanation is dubious. Since I am 
somewhat familiar with the way in which documents are submitted 
to Viktor Stepanovich for signing, it seems to me that nobody in 
the government saw this charter. Moreover, the draft new 
structure ratified by government apparatus leader Kvasov was 
signed by Natalya Ivanovna and Pavel Fedorovich. 
  Polezhayeva began to carry out the reorganization on the 
basis of the ratified charter. As a result, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
should have three departments as of today -- a social policy 
department, a culture department, and a state and law 
department. This is why there have been so many dismissals. 
Moreover, legally independent agencies of the most diverse kind 
are starting to work under the editorial office -- PROTOCOL for 
official information, DERZHAVA for regional information, BIZNES 
V ROSSII for economic information, and another for security; 
there will be schooling for young journalists, and so forth. 
Most probably some of those dismissed will be taken on by the 
agencies and find the reorganization painless. But the fact 
that the leaders of these new formations were carefully selected 
by Polezhayeva shows that only staffers who are particularly 
loyal to the Polezhayeva "regime" will be taken on. 
  Natalya Ivanovna herself refused to comment on the situation 
in her own publication. But things may be made clearer by the 
Savelovskiy courts, where an illegal dismissal suit has been 
filed against the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA administration by Marina 
Cherednichenko, Polezhayeva's former deputy. On the basis of 
the results of the first hearing it is as yet hard to be certain 
who will win.

  [Text] Moscow -- Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the 
"Yabloko" faction in the State Duma, doubts that Boris Yeltsin's 
recent economic edicts are going to "work." He has pointed out 
that on the whole, the direction of movement on the road of 
economic reform chosen by this package of documents is correct, 
but the "very execution of the edicts leaves much to be 
desired." "Politically, this is an attempt by the president to 
seize the initiative in the absence of such in the government. 
However, the content of the edicts raises big doubts as to the 
realism of the measures implied by them," G. Yavlinskiy stressed.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report from the "Trade" column: "The </F>
Importance of the Pipeline and Special Exporter Status Will 
Grow. A Government Source Comments on a Presidential Edict 
Abolishing Export Quotas and Licensing"] 
  [Text] After the edict canceling export quotas and 
licensing has been adopted, the role of special exporters will 
increase substantially, a government source who asked not to be 
identified said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
Because even now the oil pipeline is operating at full 
capacity, the abolition of oil quotas and licenses without 
abolishing the special exporter status effectively gives the 
advantage of "getting into the pipe" to those companies which 
have benefited from their status in the past. However, 
considering that the oil pipe does not stretch like rubber, it 
can be assumed that if special exporters were also abolished, 
bribes and connections would be used, which would lead to a 
civil war over the oil pipelines. 
  Experts are rather critical of the edict on cancellation of 
duties and quotas. Thus, some politicians believe that the 
edict is nonviable. Others (including NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
source) point to the edict's equivocal wording which will lend 
itself to different interpretations by specialists. 
  In fact the presidential edict annulled Appendix 1 to last 
year's government resolution "On Liberalizing Foreign Economic 
Activity" which laid down procedures for quantity regulation and 
licensing. Commenting at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's request on the 
new trade scheme, the source noted that it is clear already: 
Military equipment, dual-purpose goods, gold, and precious 
stones will be subject to licensing and quantity regulation. 
Furthermore, under the presidential edict, international 
delivery quotas, established from outside, will remain on 
aluminum and textiles. 
  "Much will depend on the interpretation which the government 
puts on the edict in its resolutions," the source said. "At 
present it is difficult to say definitely what the edict's 
implications will be or how they will impact on the business 
climate in Russia and foreign investments." 
  Earlier, Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister Andrey 
Dogayev said that the state will regulate trade through six to 
seven domestically produced goods, including deliveries within 
the framework of "external quotas" under international 
agreements. 
  Incidentally, a joint statement by the government and the 
Central Bank provides for the cabinet's obligation to lift 
restrictions on all commodities with the exception of crude oil, 
diesel fuel, electricity, nickel, aluminum, and copper, 
restrictions on which, according to the statement, will be 
lifted at the end of 1994.

  [Text] When he signed a government ordinance making A-310 
aircraft and their parts exempt from customs duties, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin was in breach of the Russian law because the 
government has no right to make such decisions, Sergey Glazyev, 
chairman of the State Duma Economic Policy Committee, told 
INTERFAX Monday. 
  A-310-300 planes are imported into Russia by Aeroflot under 
a 
leasing agreement with a consortium of European banks. Four air 
buses of this kind are now in operation in Russia. A fifth 
crashed near Mezhdurechensk, a town in the Kemerovo Region, 
killing 75 passengers and crew. 
  Glazyev believed that the losses incurred in operating the 
A-310's was the sole reason why Aeroflot was given tax relief. 
  Without this relief, the new import duties to be imposed as 
of July 1 on aircraft and their parts would kill the idea of 
importing A-310's, Glazyev believed.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- "There will be no 
privatization a la Chubays in Moscow," Moscow Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov told ITAR-TASS here today. "It is not the matter of 
conflict between the chairman of the State Committee for 
Property and me, but essential differences in the vitally 
important issue of the implementation of the state privatization 
program". 
  Commenting on the recent appeal of Anatoliy Chubays to the 
Russian procurator general's office in connection with the 
Moscow mayor's privatization resolutions, Luzhkov said "I accept 
this proposal of Mr Chubays with readiness, but I want him to 
visit the procurator general's office together with me. I am 
convinced that it is not my privatization resolutions that run 
counter to the law but resolutions of the State Property 
Committee". 
  In the opinion of Luzhkov, "the state institution has 
usurped 
the right to solve all problems in privatization and sometimes 
makes serious mistakes" . 
  "We think that property should be sold and not squandered or 
given away dirt cheap to anyone. That is why, I believe that 
voucher privatization is a swindle to be investigated by the 
procurator general due to the inadmissibility to squander state 
property," he stressed. 
  Asked about major drawbacks in privatization, Luzhkov said 
"I 
am sure that privatization a la Chubays has brought almost no 
positive results. It brought us no additional property. It 
only ruins the state. Russia gained no new owners and 
proprietors, as Chubays has promised. Privatization resulted in 
an enormous number of speculators who are looking for an 
opportunity to sell at high prices what they have bought dirt 
cheap".

  [Text] The Russian government has appointed Andrey Dagayev 
the new Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations. 
  INTERFAX learned from sources in the government that this 
appointment was due to the increasing role of the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations in coordination of foreign economic 
activities of the federation's constituent members and to 
strengthening control over the export-import operations. 
Earlier, Dagayev had headed the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations Department of Export-Import Operations for State Needs 
and had been responsible for registration of special exporters. 
He will continue to perform these functions in his new post. 
  Dagayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that state 
control 
over export activities of the regions would be more important 
since the president had issued the decree cancelling quotas and 
licensing of export deliveries.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Large-scale unemployment is 
fraught with such a social explosion that consequences of 
hyper-inflation will seem a trifle, Russian Vice-Premier Yuriy 
Yarov told a seminar-conference on social development of Russian 
regions here today. 
  In his words, the situation will run out of control in the 
near future if the government, the federal employment service 
and the local authorities take no immediate measures to prevent 
large-scale unemployment. 
  According to forecasts of specialists, the number of 
officially registered unemployed will reach three millions by 
the end of this year. The concealed unemployment that is 
currently estimated at approximately seven million will at least 
double. 
  Unemployment has turned into a major problem of social 
services. It should be settled by joint efforts of the 
authorities, employment centers and trade unions, said Yarov. 
  In his opinion, the state should allocate money for payment 
of dole from the federal budget to those regions and districts 
that are in critical condition. The state debt of regions with 
a high rate of unemployment should be paid fully and in the 
first turn.

  [Text] Mutual non-payments remain a characteristic feature 
of the Russian economy. This has been confirmed by the latest 
figures from the State Statistics Committee. As of 1 April 1994 
the total debt of industrial enterprises, construction 
businesses, transport and agriculture amounted to 93 trillion 
rubles. 
  According to the estimates of the economics institute for 
the 
problems of the transition period, the budget deficit for the 
first quarter has already reached 11 percent of the Gross 
National Product. Let me remind you that in its draft budget 
for 1994, the government undertook not to exceed the 10 percent 
mark for its deficit. 
  There are still budgetary debts to a number of industries. 
This in turn leads to non-payments on the part of the 
enterprises, not only to each other and to banks, but to the 
budget as well.

in zones of inter-ethnic conflict. In addition, the stolen gold 
and diamonds are accumulated in order "to create a currency 
basis for newly created independent state entities." 
  According to Major General of the Militia Ivan Sardak, 
deputy 
chief of the Main Department on Economic Crimes within the 
Russian Interior Ministry, a tendency for worsening 
characterizes the crime situation in the sphere of currency 
circulation which may still aggravate in the near future. 
  Over 1993 the Interior Ministry's services on economic 
crimes 
confiscated about two billion rubles in foreign currency in the 
course of criminal investigation, that is about 20 percent of 
all confiscated currency valuables. Over the first quarter of 
this year the law enforcement bodies have already confiscated 
1,183 million rubles. 
  In addition, while investigating the cases of robbery of 
precious metals and stones, the law enforcement bodies have 
confiscated as much as 253 kilograms of gold, 49 kg of platinum, 
1900 kg of silver, 2000 carats of diamonds, and other valuables 
amounting to 15.573 million rubles. 
  At the same time the real scale of precious materials 
robbery 
greatly exceeds the mentioned data because not more than 5-10 
percent of the total number of such crimes are exposed by the 
law enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliamentary 
delegation, which began a four-day visit to Moscow on Saturday 
[21 May], met Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Duma (lower chamber 
of the Russian parliament) today. 
  The four-member delegation, led by Chairman of the Slovak 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Ivan Laluha, also met 
first deputy chairman of the Duma, Mikhail Mityukov, Deputy 
Chairman of the Council of the Federation (upper house) Valerian 
Viktorov and members of parliament and parliamentary committees. 
  No meeting was scheduled with the radical nationalist 
Liberal 
Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
  Discussion centered on the Partnership for Peace Programme 
and cooperation with NATO, Laluha said at a press conference. 
The Russian parliamentarians emphasized that Moscow's position 
on the question in no way constituted a threat to the security 
of the countries of Central Europe, he said. The view prevalent 
in the Duma is that integration into European structures is 
exclusively an internal political matter of the Central European 
states themselves, he said. 
  The delegation also extended an invitation to visit 
Slovakia. 
  Laluha declared the visit a success. He stressed the 
delegation had comprised members of both the government and the 
opposition because the foreign policy aim of full integration 
into Western economic and security structures found consensus in 
Slovakia. 
  The delegation received assurances that the Russian-Slovak 
treaty signed by presidents Boris Yeltsin and Michal Kovac last 
August would be debated by the Duma as a matter of priority. 
The delay in ratification was not due to any misunderstandings 
but the need to work out some essential procedures, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, May 29 (CTK) -- Russian Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin and his Slovak counterpart Ladislav Pittner, on a 
short official visit to Moscow, signed an inter-ministerial 
agreement on cooperation today. 
  Yerin told journalists that the document "envisaged joint 
operations and information exchanges in fighting the most 
dangerous kinds of crime such as organised crime, economic 
crime, illegal trade in narcotics and arms. 
  Pittner said that by its content the agreement did not 
differ 
from those Slovakia concluded with other countries. "The only 
difference is that it has been worked out more quickly and in 
greater detail and I can say that we have met with far greater 
willingness here than in other cases," he said. 
  The Czech Republic has not yet concluded such an agreement 
with Russia. Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml negotiated the 
preparation of such a document in Moscow last October. A 
Russian Interior Ministry high-ranking official told CTK today 
that Prague "was not efficient enough during the talks." "The 
Slovak interior minister tabled the question as soon as he took 
office. The agreement was prepared very quickly. The Slovaks 
have been more prompt," the official said. 
  Pittner noted that the transformation of the civic systems 
in 
Russia and Slovakia is bringing both countries similar problems. 
"We are interested in cooperation in solving the whole packages 
of problems such as narcotics, dirty money laudering, trade in 
the `white flesh,' prostitution, and the forgery of passports 
and other documents. We seek to solve these problems jointly 
without unnecessarily prolonging the process," he said. 
  Pittner said that beside the so-called Balkan route of drug 
smuggling there appeared an influx of narcotics from the Central 
Asian republics of the former Soviet Union and here we "can 
obtain very valuable information from the Russian Police," he 
said. Pittner pointed out that many citizens from Chechnya and 
the Central Asian countries illegally stay in Slovakia and that 
the agreement creates pre-requisites for solving this problem. 
  Yerin noted that the agreement envisaged joint operations 
aimed at the abolition of the channels of illegal trade in 
narcotics. "New and still little investigated channels of 
narcotic smuggling from Afganistan and the Central Asian 
republics of the former Soviet Union have recently appeared. We 
have gathered great experience of cooperation with our 
colleagues in these countries and all the information will be 
undoubtly provided to our colleagues in Slovakia," the Russian 
minister said. 
  "We have similar agreements with Western countries and their 
importance will be the greater, the better our cooperation with 
the Russian Police, Pittner said.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA -- The Interior Ministry of the 
Russian Federation has received a request for 20 workers of the 
ministry whom the UN expects to incorporate in the international 
police force discharging peacekeeping functions in Angola. As 
Chief Inspector of the Main Personnel Department of the ministry 
Aleksandra Zemskova told a RIA correspondent, the question of 
the trip of Russian policemen to Angola has not yet been 
decided. According to her, some time earlier the leadership of 
the Interior Ministry had refused to send its men to Mozambique 
because of the hot climate in that country and considering that 
in Angola the climate is no better it can be assumed that the UN 
request will hardly be granted. 
  Zemskova stressed that the Russian police contingent acting 
as part of the peacekeeping force on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia has well acquitted itself and has earned a high 
assessment of specialists. "This explains the increased demand 
for our workers," noted the spokesman of the Russian Interior 
Ministry. She reported that now a group of five Russian 
policemen is preparing for dispatch to Haiti where they will go 
as soon as the appropriate UN mandates are received.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA -- "Russia insists on an 
unconditional fulfilment in full volume of all resolutions of 
the UN Security Council with respect to Iraq", said the chairman 
of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, in the course of his meeting 
today with the chairman of the National Assembly of Kuwait, 
Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al- Sa'dun who is on an official visit to 
Russia. 
  "The position of Russia is immutable since 1990 when Iraq 
started its aggression against Kuwait", Ivan Rybkin pointed out. 
For his own part, the chairman of the Kuwait parliament 
expressed gratitude for Russia's actions in the UN Security 
Council and the hope that they would continue to contribute to 
the final settlement of the problem. According to the chairman 
of the Kuwait National Assembly, "peace in the region can only 
be established after a final demarcation of the border between 
Kuwait and Iraq and the completion of the exchange of prisoners".

  [Text] Moscow, May 25, RIA -- The border between Russia and 
Mongolia, stretching for 3,485 kilometres, has always been a 
frontier of good-neighbourliness, none of the sides has ever 
made territorial claims against each other. 
  This fundamental principle is now enshrined in a treaty of 
friendship and cooperation between Russia and Mongolia signed by 
the presidents of the two countries in January 1993, Nikolay 
Pavlov, chairman of a Russian delegation in the mixed 
Russian-Mongolian border commission, said in an interview with 
RIA. 
  Although historically there have always been good relations 
on the Russian-Mongolian border, checks are currently being made 
along it, Pavlov said. 
  This verification, which began in 1987, is aimed at giving a 
more clear identification on the terrain of the border line, 
repairing old and installing new border posts, and carrying out 
a great deal of cartographical and other work. 
  To verify the border a mixed Russian-Mongolian commission 
was 
set up, consisting of a Russian and a Mongolian delegation. 
  The Russian delegation included representatives of the 
Foreign Ministry, of the Defence Ministry, Border Troops, and 
also of the governments of the Altay, Tuva and Buryat republics 
and administration of the Chita region. 
  In spite of material and technical difficulties, noted 
Pavlov, it is planned this year to complete all work connected 
with the installation, repairs and painting of border posts and 
fully to hand over the frontier to the frontier troops of the 
sides. 
  The Mongolian side is also interested in the conclusion of 
the verification. 
  The clear demarcation of the border and its inviolability 
are 
seen by it as a major factor for strengthening friendship and 
cooperation betaeen the peoples of Russia and Mongolia, Pavlov 
said in conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow, May 20, RIA -- At their meeting today 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin examined in detail the draft federal budget. They agreed 
that by the second reading of the draft the State Duma Budget 
Committee will work out proposals on increasing allocations to 
the defense sphere, chiefly to hi-tech conversion production 
processes. Most of the deputies insist that these allocations 
be brought to 55 trillion rubles. 
  "Such reserves exist and there's no need to increase the 
debit side of the budget," said Mr. Rybkin, informing the 
deputies of his meeting with the Russian president, which lasted 
more than an hour. He noted that allocations will also be raised 
to servicemen's social needs, education, science, and culture. 
  According to Mr. Rybkin, the Russian president accepted the 
State Duma's amendments to the draft law on the Constitutional 
Court but refused to name the supposed candidacies to the 
justices' vacancies, since the choice has not yet been made from 
the numerous proposals. 
  Mr. Rybkin said the Russian president backed his proposal to 
move the minieconomy agencies that have not yet left the former 
State Planning Committee building now occupied by the Duma to 
Lubyanskaya Square. There are many vacant premises there, noted 
he.

  [Text] Moscow, May 21, RIA -- The process of transforming 
the Democratic Russia movement into a party of the same name is 
being continued. A two-day conference of representatives of 
more than 40 regional affiliations of the movement opened today 
in the parliamentary centre of Russia to form an organising 
committee and discuss the strategy and tactics of advocates of 
reforms. 
  According to one of the leaders of Democratic Russia, 
Aleksandr Korotich, the new party will differ from other Russian 
parties formed after the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union] pattern, that is it will abandon the vertical line of 
democratic centralism. 
  In his speech, one of the co-chairmen of Democratic Russia, 
Lev Ponomarev, noted that the idea of turning the movement into 
a party has been maturing for a long time and become now vital 
since under the new law on parties, currently considered by the 
State Duma, only parties may participate in elections while 
movements should leave the political stage and become mass 
organisations only. 
  "Like when we started our struggle against communism, now as 
reforms have choked we should start from the very beginning and 
are doomed to many years of tenacious efforts," said Lev 
Ponomarev.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA--The Duma faction of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia considers as "political indecency" the 
far from proper word used by former Russian Secretary of State 
Gennadiy Burbulis in the Sunday Itogi television programme to 
describe the way the new Constitution of Russia was adopted. 
  This is said in a statement issued by the faction. The 
faction believes that Burbulis insulted millions of people who 
on December 12 voted for the new fundamental law. 
  "The Agrarian Party was firmly against the adopted version 
of 
the Constitution. Mr Burbulis must have forgotten the vigour 
and persistence with which the presidential team, in which Mr 
Burbulis had no last role to play, was pushing through its draft 
of the fundamental law," said the statement. 
  The document also mentions "Mr Burbulis's sinister role in 
the history of Russia of the recent period".

the persons who got their discharge on June 1 begin working in a 
private television company called TK-6, which they themselves 
have set up, acquiring with the help of sponsors studio and 
filming equipment, as well as their own transmitter. So far it 
has a small radius of operation, but already by the autumn it 
will be replaced by a more powerful one, and then TK-6 telecasts 
will be receivable by residents of practically all the central 
and southern areas of Krasnoyarsk territory where more than two 
million people live. This is already the fourth private 
television company operating in Krasnoyarsk.

  [Text] Vladivostok, May 30, RIA -- A TNT-5 tanker with 
liquid radioactive wastes has been tugged to far roads in the 
Pavlovskiy harbour from the wharves of the "Zvezda" plant in the 
city of Bolshoy Kamen. The operation to move the vessel to a 
safe place was ordered by the Pacific Fleet command after the 
workers of the plant and the mass media spread concern over a 
possible spill of radioactive wastes into the sea. Even though 
after a careful inspection of the vessel specialists did not 
register any increased radioactivity or the penetration of sea 
water into the containers with wastes, it was decided to take 
the tanker away from the shore.

  [Text] Moscow, May 20, RIA -- The Central Electoral 
Commission of the Russian Federation today recommended St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak before June 10 to correct the 
violations of the legislation on elections and make the 
necessary amendments in the statute on elections to the St. 
Petersburg City Assembly. 
  This decision follows the fact that when elections were held 
to the City Assembly on March 20 and 21 and also after a repeat 
voting on April 3, 1994 the St. Petersburg mayor violated with 
his orders a number of articles of the basic regulations on 
elections to representative bodies of state authority. 
  Vyacheslav Marychev, a State Duma deputy who was present at 
the session, after saying emotionally that "whole military units 
were forced to vote", demanded that the commission should not 
limit itself to recommendations, but revoke the results of the 
repeated voting. 
  But Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central 
Electoral Commission, explained that only the president has this 
kind of competence. 
  In the event of the St. Petersburg mayor failing to meet the 
commission's recommendations, it can only draw the president's 
attention to Sobchak's actions. 
  The session was also told that the Supreme Court of the 
Russian Federation today left unsatisfied a complaint by the St. 
Petersburg City court that the City Assembly elections were 
unlawful.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, May 20 (RIA) -- In connection with the 
seizure of five Ingush citizens in a suburb of Vladikavkaz last 
night, Vladimir Lozovoi, head of the provisional administration 
on part of the territories of Northern Ossetia and Ingushetia in 
the rank of vice-premier, has issued an official statement for 
the mass media. The statement notes, in particular, that "of 
late gross violations of law and order, explosions of military 
equipment, shellings of the Russian Army's peace-making forces 
and seizures of hostages have become more frequent in the area 
of the emergency situation." Lozovoi has called upon the 
relatives and friends of the captured men to remain calm and 
restrained and assured them that all necessary steps would be 
taken for their release. 
  The head of the provisional administration stressed that the 
appropriate measures would be taken with regard to the 
authorities and heads of law-enforcement bodies of Northern 
Ossetia and Ingushetia who are unable or unwilling to carry out 
their duties in introducing law and order. The inactivity of 
the authorities of both republics may lead to an aggravation of 
the situation in the entire south of Russia, the statement 
notes.

  [Text] Simferopol, May 28, RIA -- Vice-Admiral Petr 
Svyatashov, chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, described 
today as "absolutely untrue" the statement of the press service 
of the commander of the Ukrainian national Guards. 
  The statement alleged, among other things, that marines of 
the Black Sea Fleet are holding tactical exercises in close 
proximity to the basing area of the National Guards of Ukraine 
and that electronic countermeasures taken by the Black sea Fleet 
suppressed for several hours the operation of the guards' radio 
and interrupted telephone communications of Interior Ministry 
bodies subordinated to Kiev. 
  Units of the fleet were and remain in places of their 
permanent basing, the vice-admiral told a RIA correspondent. 
"We have not moved our men there, on the contrary, we carry our 
reductions, transferring men to the reserve, whereas the Defence 
Ministry, the Security Service and the National Guards of 
Ukraine are bringing in military units into the Crimea. They 
are engaged in a build-up of strength in areas where units of 
the fleet are based. Here, the strength of Ukrainian units is 
already upwards of 52,000 personnel," Svyatashov said. 
According to him, there are more than 2,000 National Guards 
stationed at the former Simferopol building school. 
  "Some people seem to be eager to see the Ukrainian 
presidential elections not to be held but be postponed 
indefinitely," Svyatashov pointed out. In his view, those 
quarters are dissatisfied with certain stabilisation of the 
situation on the peninsula and are trying to aggravate it. 
Therein lies the purpose of the statement of the press service 
of the National Guards of Ukraine, just as the talk of the 
possible introduction of direct presidential rule in the Crimea.

  [Text] Moscow, RIA, May 30 -- The State Duma and the 
Russian Federation Council are due to consider the issue of 
potential financing Sevastopol as the main base of the Black Sea 
Fleet during its forthcoming sessions, a RIA correspondent was 
told by Viktor Semenov, chairman of the city council of 
Sevastopol. 
  In his words, "the Federal Assembly of Russia must take into 
account financing of Sevastopol when endorsing the budget, since 
one-fourth of the 400 thousand population of the city works in 
the areas related to the Black sea Fleet." 
  Mr. Semenov also indicated that the situation in Sevastopol 
"is quite normal. The citizens are prepared to receive 
holiday-makers from all over the former Soviet Union and the 
bathing season is in full swing."

<F P=106> [John Lloyd report: "Ukraine Seeks Recipe for Economic </F>
Survival"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's economy is in deep crisis. Production 
has fallen an estimated 40 per cent compared with last year and 
both its currency and state revenues have plunged. 
  Inflation has been screwed down from hyperinflationary 
levels 
to around 6 per cent a month and official unemployment is a mere 
100,000 people. But this is achieved, economists say, at the 
cost of idle plants and millions of workers paid -- or more 
often not paid -- to do nothing. 
  The plight of the economy, and possible reforms to drag it 
out of the mire, were discussed yesterday by international 
economists at a conference in Kiev organised by the World Bank, 
the Kiev International Centre for Advanced Studies and the 
Economic Policy journal. 
  Among those on the podium were Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the 
formgr deputy prime minister of Poland, Mr Sergey Vasiliyev, 
deputy economics minister of Russia, and Professor Jeffrey 
Sachs, the highest-profile western adviser to the economies in 
transition. Mr Balcerowicz, the inspiration behind Polish 
reforms in 1990 and 1991, told the audience that Poland in 1989 
was in a similar position to Ukraine today, with suppressed 
hyperinflation, a command economy and little private sector. "A 
radical programme can work," Mr Balcerowicz said, "so long as it 
includes stabilisation of the currency, privatisation and a 
unified exchange rate" -- none of which Ukraine at present has. 
  Mr Vasiliyev, in the rare role for a Russian minister of 
being seen as the representative of a success story, said that 
"if Ukraine continues on the road it is now on it has no chance 
of coming out of its crisis. Experience shows that the more 
rapidly you go, the faster you get out." 
  Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and 
a former reformist deputy prime minister with responsibility for 
the economy commented: "We in Ukraine have chosen to show the 
word that we can commit every possible mistake on the road to a 
market economy." 
  Mr Daniel Kaufman, the head of the World Bank mission in 
Kiev, said that the black economy was now growing rapidly -- 
despite increasingly desperate efforts by the government to 
tighten its grip on the state sector. 
  "Literally speaking, assets, capital, activities and 
entrepreneurs have departed from the official economy (but) the 
emergence and growth of the unofficial economy does demonstrate 
the entrepreneurship, creativity and ability to adapt and 
survive of Ukraine's citizens. 
  "This bodes well for the future," said Mr Kaufman.

<F P=106> [Letter from the Sergey Komissarenko, Ukrainian Ambassador </F>
to London: "The Causes of Crisis in Crimea"] 
  [Text] Sir, Your editorial, "Troubled Crimea" (May 23), 
shows a marked support for Crimean separatism in Ukraine and 
may, unintentionally, give irresponsible politicians in Crimea 
the impression that you are encouraging secession. 
  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has more than once 
spoken 
in favour of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The United 
Kingdom endorsed the tripartite statement in January of Ukraine, 
the United States and Russia, which guarantees Ukraine's present 
borders. We hope that the British public will share the same 
view on this complicated issue. 
  The Republic of Crimea already enjoys considerable autonomy 
within the Ukraine constitution. 
  It is not fair to blame Ukraine for delays in the division 
of 
the Black Sea Fleet, not least because the negotiations have not 
yet been completed. 
  In spite of rather strong internal opposition to nuclear 
disarmament, Ukraine has never backtracked from its obligations 
to remove nuclear weapons and consistently fulfils them. 
  Finally, Max van der Stoel, who is High Commissioner for 
National Minorities for the Conference on Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, stated in February that the situation of 
minorities in Ukraine can be regarded as exemplary, especially 
in comparison with some other areas in the former Soviet Union.

  [Text] Moscow, May 30, RIA -- "The situation in the Crimea, 
particularly in Simferopol, is outwardly calm, although the 
internal tension persists," a RIA correspondent was told by 
Pyotr Chernyatevich, Crimean president's advisor in a telephone 
interview. 
  In his words, the situation was critically destabilised by a 
recent statement by Nikolay Mikhalchenko, aide to the Ukrainian 
president, who said that Leonid Kravchuk is currently 
considering introduction of direct presidential rule not only in 
the Crimea but on the entire territory of Ukraine. 
  Tomorrow is the last day of the deadline set by Kiev for the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet to reject the Constitution of 1992. To 
date, noted Mr. Chernyatevich, the working group of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled to settle the most 
acute problems together with their Crimean counterparts, has not 
yet arrived in the Crimea. Stability in the Crimea is 
continuedly hampered by the fact that all first deputies of the 
Ukrainian power ministries remain on the peninsula. To cap it, 
the Ukrainian armed forces started moving again this morning, 
said Pyotr Chernyatevich, who saw in person a column of armoured 
personnel carriers moving to Sevastopol. He failed to identify 
whom they belonged to and what was their destination. 
  In all appearance, these were combat vehicles of the 
Ukrainian National Guard, since the commanders of the 32nd 
Ukrainian Army Corps vehemently deny their involvement with any 
moves of personnel or hardware, emphasised Mr. Chernyatevich.

  [Text] Simferopol, May 30, RIA -- Despite the political 
situation in Crimea, the security service operated by Kiev and 
locally subordinated Interior Ministry structures are working 
hand in glove to ensure legality and law and order, Valeriy 
Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security 
Service, told a RIA correspondent. 
  The services are cooperating above all in combating 
organised 
crime. 
  There is also close cooperation between the security 
service, 
the Interior Ministry and specialists of the Black Sea Fleet in 
the investigation of a case involving an attempt to carry out a 
blast in Sevastopol on May 24. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted against Veniamin 
Demin, a suspect, but he continues to deny his guilt. 
  In Malikov's view, there are no problems between members of 
his department and the Interior Ministry in Crimea. 
  "If professionals were less distracted into political 
wrangles, their work would be more productive," he said. 
  The most important thing for the security service and the 
Interior Ministry in Crimea now is to solve legal questions -- 
eliminate contradictions in legislative standards of Crimea and 
Ukraine.

  [Text] Simferopol, May 30 (RIA)--"The hope now appears for 
peaceful and smooth solution of the Crimean issue", Lieutenant- 
General Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian 
Security Service, told the RIA correspondent. For nearly one 
month Malikov has been staying on the peninsula. His hopes lie 
with the visits to the Crimea coming this week by chairmen of 
the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and the Ukrainian side of the joint 
group of the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Soviets for settling 
the conflict. 
  Malikov added that at his recent meetings with Ukrainian and 
Crimean politicians he witnessed their desire to resolve 
problems in the negotiating process in a civilised way. When 
the desire to reach agreement becomes more insistent with every 
day, extraordinary turn for the worse can hardly be expected. 
  As to the Security Service in the Crimea, which is under 
Kiev's jurisdiction unlike the forces of the Interior, the 
service will act in keeping with the Ukrainian Constitution as 
long as the present legality exists. If another decision is 
taken following the negotiations, the Security Service will 
obey, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- Keeping the situation calm on 
the surface, the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Soviets started 
"tempered bickering," believes Crimean president's advisor for 
military issues Pyotr Chernyatevich. 
  Speaking on the phone with a RIA correspondent he claimed 
that the Ukrainian parliament traces every move taken by their 
Crimean counterparts. Once the Crimean Supreme Soviet has put 
today's plenary session on Constitution off from 9 A.M. to 2 
P.M., the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet fired back and postponed its 
session with a similar agenda from Tuesday to Wednesday. 
  Despite this wait-and-see policy adopted by Ukraine, says 
the 
presidential advisor, there are good reasons to hope that the 
working group of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will arrive in the 
Crimea at long last next Thursday. Only then will it be 
possible to bring a definite solution to the long-running 
dispute. 
  In his words, the people in the Crimea keep a watchful eye 
on 
the developments in anticipation of new moves by Kiev. 
  The fact that deputy heads of Ukrainian power ministries are 
still based in the Crimea only increases psychological tension 
on the local population, insists Mr. Chernyatevich.

  [Text] Minsk, May 31, RIA -- The actions of Vyacheslav 
Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers, in signing a 
treaty on merging the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus, 
contain no corpus delicti. 
  This is the conclusion formed by the republican prosecutor's 
office which examined, at the request of some political parties 
in opposition to the government, whether some articles of the 
treaty correspond to the Constitution of Belarus. 
  Nikolay Kupriyanov, head of the supervisory department of 
the 
prosecutor's office, explained that certain clauses of the 
treaty, in particular one on transforming the national bank into 
a subsidiary of the Russian Central Bank, contradict the 
republic's fundamental law, which grants the national bank the 
rights and duties of the country's sole issuing centre. 
  But, in Kupriyanov's view, actually Kebich did not sign this 
clause, because Stanislav Bogdanevich, the chairman of the 
National Bank, had previously refused to initial it. 
  So there is no reason to charge the prime minister before 
the 
entry of the treaty into force. 
  The charge against Kebich was lifted today -- the day his 
candidacy was entered in the list of presidential candidates as 
no. 1, a RIA correspondent was told in the Central Electoral 
Commission.

among the foreign policy priorities of Uzbekistan. This was 
stated at a press conference at the Uzbek Embassy in Moscow 
today to mark the 2nd anniversary of the treaty on the 
fundamental principles of relations between the two countries. 
Addressing journalists, Vice- President of Uzbekistan Bakhtiyar 
Khamidov said that Russia accounted for 45 [per]cent of his 
country's annual foreign trade turnover, of which more than half 
are direct links between goods manufacturers. According to the 
vice-president, the prospects for all-round cooperation between 
Uzbekistan and Russia are "very favourable".

<F P=106> [Interviews with Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Union of </F>
Traditionalists, Giorgi Kobakhidze, leading member of the 
National-Democratic Party, Lamar Chkheidze, leader of the Iliad 
Chavchavadze Society, Redo Paatashvili, leader of Charter-91, by 
Lila Gurbutashvili; place and date not given: "In Search of a 
Foothold"] 
  [Excerpts] Akaki Asatiani, chairman of the Union of 
Traditionalists, recently informed Parliament about the creation 
of a new faction -- the "Center" faction. The statement was 
made on behalf of the Union of Traditionalists, the Merab 
Kostava Society, the Conservative-Monarchist Party, and 
Charter-91. We talked on this subject to Akaki Asatiani, Giorgi 
Kobakhidze, Lamar Chkheidze, and Redo Paatashvili. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Gurbutashvili] The National-Democrats are in the 
majority, the opposition, or.... What is your attitude 
regarding "Center?" 
  [Kobakhidze] Let me, first of all, speak about the so-called 
"Center." In general, I think it is premature to speak about 
its creation (in spite of the fact that a statement has been 
made). I doubt that this will be an influential faction. It is 
one thing to be in a coalition and another to be in a faction 
where responsibility is restricted within fixed limits. I 
believe that, on account of the positions they adopt, the 
factions united within it will be unable to tolerate these 
limits. This is the first point. Second, when speaking of 
positions and principles, there are many things that I find 
incomprehensible.... For example, it is incomprehensible why 
the "Traditionalists" view themselves as part of the opposition 
when they have assumed responsibility for the implementation of 
economic reform (I have in mind their submitting Basil as a 
candidate and his appointment as deputy prime-minister [for 
economic questions]). In general, such a step taken by someone 
in the opposition is incomprehensible.... On the other hand, 
another organization that is a friend of the "Traditionalists" 
-- the Merab Kostava Society -- has a completely different 
attitude from them toward the head of state who determines state 
policy today. Proceeding from the rules of politics in general, 
such a thing does not usually take place, but, as can be seen, 
nothing comes as a surprise in Georgia.... As you know, society 
is touchy today and any caustic remark or violent action has a 
negative effect upon it. The word "center" (the very essence of 
the word) has a calming and positive effect upon people and this 
is precisely the reason why it was created. I repeat once more 
that the Merab Kostava Society or the "Traditionalists" cannot 
be in the "Center" because the former is completely opposed to 
the head of state and the latter have basically manifested their 
support for him (proceeding from the status of their member 
Basil). The center generally takes shape itself, but not by 
appropriating the name. The political center is not well-defined 
today but it should be viewed as being made up of, first and 
foremost, the National- Democratic Party [NAP] and the 
Republicans and then the Liberal- Democratic National Party. 
The center's course is charted in this way. 
  [Gurbutashvili] Do you consider yourselves to be in 
the center? 
  [Kobakhidze] From the political point of view, the NAP is in 
the center; there is us and then the two organizations that I 
mentioned. The order in which I listed the organizations 
corresponds to the level of their activity and their importance. 
  [Gurbutashvili] That means we can expect confrontation 
between your center and the "Center" that has already been 
proclaimed? 
  [Kobakhidze] We do not intend to wage a battle over the 
name. We have our own firm position. We have never played this 
type of game -- in this way or that -- and it is our intention 
not to do so in the future. Our position is as follows: Early 
elections to be held as soon as possible. 
  [Gurbutashvili] Are you in opposition to the head of 
state? 
  [Kobakhidze] We are in opposition from the position of the 
center. We disassociate ourselves from the majority [in 
Parliament] and the [Liberal-Conservative] coalition and the 
[Center] faction. 
  [Chkheidze] It is difficult and also probably incorrect to 
say anything in advance. It depends upon how consistent a 
position they adopt; proceeding from this, one can speak about 
the "Center." Our society joined the [Liberal-Conservative] 
coalition because we wanted to see all the opposition parties 
united. Unfortunately, this has not happened; only some of them 
have united. We did not view it as right that there should be 
even greater integration with a part of them. We do not want 
our organization to lose its identity. That is to say, we agree 
to cooperate with all who adhere to national and democratic 
positions. The center is a fairly relative concept in Georgia 
today. If, before, radicalism was viewed as being politically 
the most profitable thing (and everyone was laying claim to 
this), today, centrism is, for some reason, viewed as such and 
everyone is now following the trend of declaring themselves to 
be centrists. 
  [Paatashvili] As regards the "Center" faction, what was done 
a few days ago was a principled decision. These four 
organizations are necessary for the normal functioning of 
Parliament and overcoming the crisis (there were arguments among 
them on this score). 
  [Gurbutashvili] Are you no longer in opposition? 
  [Paatashvili] I consider us to be representatives of the 
opposition; we are opposed to the current policies and to the 
majority who support the present authorities. "Center" 
signifies the center from the political point of view; it does 
not mean that representatives of the opposition should not be 
united within it. Representatives of the majority can remain on 
the right, representatives of a part of the opposition on the 
left, and, at the same time, those in the opposition who are 
opposed to the authorities regarding a whole number of questions 
can remain in the center. As regards Charter-91, consultations 
have been taking place. The creation of the faction, in 
contrast to the coalition, signifies even greater cooperation. 
Joint decisions should be taken here. This, as you know, 
imposes strict limits upon the representatives of each 
individual faction. Consultations are continuing on a whole 
number of questions and nothing has finally been established. 
Charter-91 has, for the moment, not committed itself to 
becoming a member. The remaining three organizations are 
continuing consultations. As regards Charter-91, from the 
political point of view, we are in opposition to the 
authorities, but there is an opposition that is more radical 
than we are and that is demanding both the resignation of the 
head of state and the dissolution of the majority. We want the 
authorities to undergo a qualitative change but this should not 
be to the detriment of the country and should not result in 
Eduard Shevardnadze's fleeing or being driven out of Georgia, 
which would cause even more instability. 
  We believe that there should be a change of power, which 
should proceed from the good will of the majority, including 
Eduard Shevardnadze; there should be a division of power and not 
instability. There is potential even in this Parliament and, if 
it is used correctly, it will be possible both to govern the 
country in a better way and create a governing team that is 
better than the present one (I have in mind both officials in 
Parliament and a whole number of government representatives).

  [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- The proposed peace-keeping 
operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict may 
become "unprecedented," says Boris Pastukhov, deputy foreign 
minister of Russia. It will involve both CIS peace makers and 
international observers. If all goes well, said Pastukhov in an 
exclusive interview to the Russian Information Agency, it will 
provide "experience projected into the future," because there 
are other regrettable conflicts and hot spots. Pastukhov 
granted the interview upon his return from the USA where he 
represented Russia's Foreign Ministry in consultations with the 
UN aimed to plan peace keeping operations. 
  He believes that the sides have harmonised the format of 
such 
an operation, and agreed to provide a broader mandate to 
international observers and to involve more observers to ensure 
the operation's success. The composition of the force was not 
discussed, but Russian troops will naturally make the backbone, 
and the total strength will reach 2,500-3,000 troops. The 
deputy foreign minister thinks that the sides agree to begin the 
operation as soon as possible. 
  The Russian delegation debated the question of setting up an 
international foundation to ensure peace in the zone of the 
conflict. Now that it is clear that the operation will be held 
within UN standards and with close interaction of CIS peace 
makers and international observers, "the very climate and the 
public opinion have become more beneficial for the operation," 
said Pastukhov. 
  He said that the Russian mission has not been delegated by 
the sides to the conflict, but the discussions in the UN were 
held within the framework of the Georgian-Abkhazian accords on 
ceasefire and disengagement of the troops.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, RIA -- Russia's Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev addressed the Baltic Council session in the 
Estonian capital on May 24 to raise the issue of Russian 
military retirees in Estonia, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's 
political adviser, told the media. She said that Kozyrev handed 
in to his Estonian counterpart a letter received by the Russian 
Embassy in Tallinn. A group of retired military wrote the 
letter to quote examples of discrimination against them. 
Russia's foreign minister stressed that the retirees are all 
over 60. 
  He said he hoped that the institution of a Baltic council 
commissar for democratic institutions and human rights, 
including the rights of minorities, would help resolve the 
region's problems. He seconded the proposed candidature of 
Denmark's former justice minister Ole Espersen. 
  At the same time, Kozyrev expressed concern over what he 
thinks is insufficiently high efficiency of the Baltic Council's 
activities, especially on the issues of infrastructure and 
transportation. 
  The Russian delegation intends to circulate memorandums on 
human rights and economic cooperation as official documents of 
the session. 
  The session will continue on May 25.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, RIA -- Today, our choice and revel 
factions of the Tallinn City Assembly met with Konstantin 
Zatulin, chairman of Russia's State Duma Committee on 
Commonwealth Affairs and Liaison with fellow-citizens, and 
Vladislav Tumanov, deputy of the Council of the Federation. 
  Speaking of the problem of Russians in Estonia, Zatulin said 
that "it is very important to us to see that human rights are 
observed not only in South Africa but in Estonia as well." 
  Tumanov said it was wrong of Estonia to allege that 7,000 
Estonian citizens reside in Russia's Pechora district. 
According to him, it has been established that there is one 
hundred Estonians residing there. Tumanov believes that the 
Pechora district with a population of 30,000 is Russian from 
time immemorial and must remain part of Russia, no matter how 
the government of Estonia may treat this. In his view, the 
conclusion of an Estonian-Russian Treaty on Contiguous Areas is 
the first step towards resolving controversies.

  [Text] Riga, May 31, RIA -- In accordance with the 
bilateral agreements signed on April 30 in Moscow, tomorrow, on 
June 1, the three last Russian naval ships will leave Liepaja 
[Latvia]. 
  As the spokesman of the Latvian Defence Ministry has 
declared, the Latvian side, in taking over the facilities of the 
Russian navy, is encountering certain difficulties. In 
particular, they are connected with their further utilisation, 
as well as the need to free the water area of the former Liepaja 
military port and other former Russian naval bases from the 
several dozen ships and submarines sunk there.

  [Text] On 31 May the Central Election Commission 
registered the following as Belorussia's [Belarus] official 
presidential candidates: Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich, ex-speaker 
Stanislaw Shushkevich, Belorussian National Front leader Zenon 
Poznyak, deputy Aleksandr Lukashenko, Communist Party leader 
Vasiliy Novikov, and kolkhoz chairman Aleksandr Dubko. 
  Gennadiy Karpenko, leader of the Party of National Accord, 
who was considered one of Kebich's main contenders in the 
elections, did not make it into the candidates' list. Karpenko 
had polled the required number of signatures but at the last 
moment 16 deputies unexpectedly recalled their signatures. 
Yesterday, without waiting for a Central Election Commission 
decision, Gennadiy Karpenko withdrew his candidacy.

  [Text] The Belarusian radio programs "Belaruskaya 
Maladzyozhnaya" [Belarusian Youth] and "Krynitsa" [Spring] have 
been suspended since 28 May. The publishing house "Belarusian 
Printing House" refuses to print the newspaper SVABODA. Media 
representatives issued declarations on the issues at a press 
conference held on 30 May. In particular, the declarations 
stated that employees of both radio programs were confronted 
with the fact that, as a result of transforming the National 
State Television and Radio Company into the Television and Radio 
Committee of the Belarusian Council of Ministers, "Krynitsa" and 
"Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" are merged -- or virtually closed 
-- and will be replaced by the Main Broadcasting Editorial 
Office to be established of the Second Radio Channel. 
  As a matter of fact, this transformation can be seen as a 
move to get rid of politically inconvenient journalists who 
disseminate objective information. As is known, "Belaruskaya 
Maladzyozhnaya" was planning a feature a live program on 28 May 
with Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich 
who is against the populist decision to merge Belarusian and 
Russian monetary units, a move that has been greeted with mixed 
opinion. 
  The employees of the two radio programs consider the 
crackdown politically motivated and an infringement of freedom, 
which places the possibility of holding democratic elections in 
Belarus in doubt. The program calls on the international 
community, law-enforcement agencies, media, and society to do 
their best to stop the violence against democratic mass media 
and freedom of speech. 
  A declaration was also issued by the opposition Belarusian 
Popular Front deputies. It said that the "offensive against 
democratic journalists and the independent press is not casual 
-- the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet, subordinate 
to it, seek to have the elections held in the atmosphere of 
misinformation. The radio and television leadership plans to 
offer inconvenient hours for democratic candidates for 
president. Meanwhile, all radio and television information 
programs and all government newspapers are jammed with 
propaganda about Prime Minister Vyachaslav Kebich." The deputies 
call on the Belarusian public and the international community to 
pay attention to the crackdown on the democratic press and other 
mass media as well as to the restoration of totalitarianism in 
Belarus. They demand that publication of newspapers VYBAR, 
NAVINY BNF, and SVABODA as well as the broadcasting of radio 
programs "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" and "Krynitsa" be 
immediately resumed.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Belorussian Authorities </F>
Review Their Attitude to Press"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The scenario of the presidential elections 
scripted by the ideologues of the Belorussian [Belarusian] 
"party in power" ["Partiya vlasti"] is now being played out. 
The government has dealt the first blow against the mass media. 
  The latest statement by Vladimir Zametalin, the Belorussian 
prime minster's press secretary, was wholly devoted to the 
biggest circulation opposition newspaper SVABODA [Freedom]. 
IZVESTIYA has managed to secure a xerox of Zametalin's original 
statement. 
  "Formally opposed to the development of democratic processes 
in the republic, nationalistically minded political forces are 
attempting to raise their public profile through the methods of 
discrediting the policy of state organs, slandering state 
leaders, and whipping up hysteria in the period of the campaign 
to elect the first president of Belorussia [Belarus].... The 
greatest activity in the creation of conditions of civil 
confrontation is being displayed by a newspaper with a title 
clearly at odds with its basic tendency -- SVABODA. The 
newspaper...is continuing to act as the political cutting-edge 
of national extremism in the republic.... The constant search 
for unverified, so-called `compromising' materials against the 
most constructive, influential, and prestigious people has 
become the rule for the paper's creative conduct and thematic 
direction.... Taking into account numerous requests from 
citizens...the Government considers it its duty to revise 
relations with this publication in the interests of 
consolidating stability in the state...." 
  The press secretary's statement conveys the atmosphere being 
created in the republic by the republic authorities on the eve 
of the elections sufficiently clearly. The powers that be 
[vlastnyye strktury] are seeking to neutralize anyone belonging 
to the opposition to the "most constructive and prestigious 
people" (read -- Prime Minsiter Vyacheslav Kebich) for the 
period of the election campaign. 
  In the case of SVABODA, they have acted simply. The paper's 
chief editor Igor Germenchuk told IZVESTIYA's correspondent that 
the "Belorusskiy dom pechati" publishing house has refused to 
print, and the Ministry of Communications to circulate, the 
"awkward" newspaper. At the present time the editors are 
exploring the possibility of publishing the newspaper outside 
Belorusssia. 
  To this it should be added that in the state radio two radio 
stations have been disbanded: "Belaruskaya maladzezhnaya" 
["Belarusian Youth"] and "Krynitsa" ["Source"]. The propaganda 
apparatus set up by the Belorussian Government does not provide 
for such "oases of democracy." Journalists have only to wait to 
see who will be the next victim of the "revision of relations."

  [Text] In its statement today the Chechen opposition 
categorically rejects terrorism as a way of achieving political 
aims and urged the Chechen people to remain calm and not to 
react to similar provocations. The statement was circulated 
following the recent assassination attempt against Chechen 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev. 
  In Chechnya any terrorist act may trigger off civil war with 
unpredictable consequences, the statement underlined. 
  The opposition described the assassination attempt as a 
result of the criminal policy of the Chechen leadership from the 
very beginning aimed at linking up with criminal structures. 
  This proves that the leadership can exercise no real 
influence on the situation which encourages different armed 
groups seeking power. As a rule, such groups have no social 
support and resort to terrorism, the statement said.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Gorodetskaya based on news agency </F>
materials under the "Northern Caucasus" rubric: "Chechnya Fears 
Russian Military Aggression. FIS Denies Groznyy's Accusations"] 
  [Excerpts] The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] 
has denied a Chechnya Foreign Ministry report alleging that the 
attempt on the life of President Dudayev was prepared by Russian 
special services. An FIS representative has stated that "the 
foreign intelligence service has long renounced the carrying out 
of terrorist acts, and it does not even have corresponding 
structures." 
  In the meantime the Russian "state terrorism" idea has 
captivated the minds of Groznyy officials. Sultan Geliskhanov, 
head of Chechnya's state security department, has discovered a 
connection between the taking of hostages in Mineralnyye Vody 
and the attempt on the life of Dzhokhar Dudayev. Speaking at a 
conference of a special team investigating the circumstances of 
the attempt on the life of the president, he asserted that the 
story involving the terrorists who seized the bus was from 
beginning to end inspired by Russian special services. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday, Chechnya made an announcement about a 
redeployment 
of Russian troops in areas bordering on the republic. Khamid 
Dzhamaldayev, deputy chief of the Chechen Republic's state 
security department, referring to the latest information from 
the Chechnya Armed Forces General Staff, said that a detachment 
of strike and ground-attack aviation of the Russian Air Force is 
being redeployed at the present time to the area of the air 
force base in Mozdok (North Ossetia) complete with Su-27 
aircraft. According to him, special units of Russia's Ministry 
of Internal Affairs "equal in its fire power to a wartime army 
division" are being redeployed to Prigorodnyy Rayon of North 
Ossetia. The "power" ministers, however, maintain that the 
situation in the republic remains stable and fully under 
control. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- Satisfaction with the Federation 
Council's endorsement of the Russian president's decree 
extending the state of emergency in the area of conflict in 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia was expressed in an interview with 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent by the presidents of both republics, 
who are members of the chamber. In the opinion of North 
Ossetian leader Akhsarbek Galazov, the refugee problem can only 
be resolved if people who are to live together understand that 
this is necessary. He also thinks that the refugee problem must 
be tackled throughout Russia. 
  Ingush President Ruslan Aushev said the new decree was 
"better than previous ones, since it was more down-to-earth." 
Specifically, it indicates that the procedure for moving people 
into abandoned dwellings must be submitted by 15 June. "But 
there is one danger: the decree may not be implemented," he 
added. 
  Concern that the decree may not be implemented was also 
voiced by Issa Kustoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's 
committee for constitutional legislation: "the disease has been 
allowed to develop unchecked and over billion rubles allocated 
to settle the problem have been swallowed up, yet there are 
still homeless people, and they are still starving." According 
to him, not a single question has yet been solved, although 
"decree after decree repeats that the provisional administration 
as a special form of rule must control the situation." A deputy 
who had visited the area of the conflict on more than one 
occasion, noted that the deputies' monitoring commission which 
it had been decided to set up had to check to see that the 
provisions of the presidential decree were being implemented.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz May 28 TASS -- The North Ossetian 
Interior Ministry has denied reports about the participation of 
North Ossetian citizens in the terroristic act that killed eight 
Georgians near the village of Algun on Friday. 
  On Friday media reports said that "the terroristic group Les 
[not further identified] based on the outskirts of the Ossetian 
village of Tarskoye where the state of emergency is in effect 
killed eight Georgians near the Ingush village of Algun who were 
building a road between Ingushetia and Georgia, bypassing North 
Ossetia. They said that the bodies of the builders were 
allegedly transported to the Sunzhensk district of Ingushetia. 
  Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from the press service of 
the North Ossetian Interior Ministry said that the group Les 
does not exist in the republic. The Ingush side made a 
statement about the brutal killing of the Georgian workers 
without preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the 
incident, the press service said. 
  The press service said that the aim of this disinformation 
is 
to "aggravate the situation on the eve of the debates on the 
extension of the state of emergency in parts of North Ossetia 
and Ingushetia, discredit North Ossetian bodies of power, build 
up tension and disrupt the negotiation process initiated by 
North Ossetia." 
  The state of emergency in some districts of North Ossetia 
has 
been extended until May 31. According to reports, the situation 
in these districts remains tense mostly because of the 
continuing fighting and attacks on civilians, military units and 
police patrols and hostage taking. 
  Sporadic shooting broke out seven times in the Prigorod 
District of North Ossetia last night. No casualties were 
reported. The situation is under control of Russian 
peace-keeping troops and local law enforcement bodies.

  [Text] Naberezhnyye Chelny (Republic of Tatarstan), 30 May 
-- Boris Yeltsin does not renounce the formula "take as much 
sovereignty as you can stand," which he uttered in 1991 with 
regard to the republics and regions that were part of Russia. 
The president of the Russian Federation stated on the steps of 
the aircraft on arrival in Naberezhnyye Chelny: "I was beaten, 
severely criticized for this phrase, but I endured it all and 
was right." 
  To confirm his words, Boris Yeltsin gave the example of 
Tatarstan, the bilateral treaty which showed that "the republic 
has taken on as much responsibilities as it can cope with. As 
for what is beyond its capabilities, it has delegated that to 
the federal authorities." 
  According to the Russian president, the main thing for 
Russia 
at present is to implement the treaty. In the view of Emil 
Pain, a Russian president expert, both sides, Russia and 
Tatarstan, have so far been violating the agreement: the 
republic is sending four-five times less tax revenue to the 
federal budget than had been laid down in the agreement. In 
turn, Russia is not ensuring that a mechanism for the 
implementation of the treaty is being drawn up. 
  Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev, when greeting 
Boris 
Yeltsin at Naberezhnyye Chelny airport, reaffirmed his adherence 
to the phrase "strong republics -- strong center." He said that 
the aim of the present meeting was "strengthening trust, finding 
a joint solution to economic problems, and discussing federal 
programs." 
  Boris Yeltsin intends to begin his look at the course of 
reform in Tatarstan at the Kama automobile works, beginning with 
the production plant that was hit by fire, to decide what help 
can be given to the automobile manufacturers. In the view of 
Sergey Shakhray, which he expressed to an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent on the eve of the visit to Tatarstan, the matter 
does not concern credits or subsidies for the Kama automobile 
works, but guarantees from the Russian Government for commercial 
and foreign investment in the joint-stock company.

<F P=106> [Video report from Kazan by correspondent Andrey Murtazin, </F>
including recording of remarks made to journalists by President 
Boris Yeltsin; from the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] [Murtazin] [passage omitted] Replying to 
questions from journalists, Boris Yeltsin noted that treaty 
relations between the Tatarstan and the center are being 
implemented. True, since the beginning of the year Kazan has 
incurred a debt of 43 billion rubles, but this is mainly because 
of mutual non-payments between enterprises. 
  [Yeltsin] We are living in accordance with the treaty. You 
understand? In the treaty we have divided up the functions 
between the state powers of Tatarstan and the Russian 
Federation. Each has undertaken certain functions which it is 
performing and for which it must be responsible, and for which 
it must receive money. So sources are obtained from here and 
from there. So it cannot be called subsidies. It is simply the 
correct distribution of labor and finance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kazan, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin and 
[Tatarstan's President] Mintimer Shaymiyev think that 
implementation of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan is a 
most important task of bilateral relations, the presidents of 
Russia and Tatarstan told journalists today immediately after 
the meeting between the Russian delegation and the Tatarstan 
leadership today in the Kazan kremlin. 
  The president of Russia said that his meetings with the 
inhabitants of the capital of Tatarstan showed that the 
political situation in the republic is returning to normal after 
the conclusion of the bilateral treaty. Boris Yeltsin stressed 
at the same time that the treaty should not become just a "piece 
of paper". A bilateral commission has been set up to implement 
the treaty. It will be headed on the Russian side by First 
Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets and not by Sergey Shakhray 
as was planned. "On the Tatarstan side, the commission will be 
headed by the prime minister [Mukhammet Sabirov]," the president 
of Russia said. 
  In Boris Yeltsin's opinion, Russia is now to move toward 
decentralization on a country-wide scale. However, it is 
inadvisable to apply the terms of the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan to other subjects of the federation. "A separate 
treaty should be signed with every republic, kray, and oblast, a 
separate demarcation of powers should be envisioned. We will 
move along that path but not so quickly that similar treaties 
will be signed with other regions this year," the Russian 
president said. 
  Replying to questions on the possibility of applying the 
bilateral treaty with Tatarstan to the CIS, the leader of Russia 
said that it is still too early to talk of that. In his opinion 
this model must first be developed within the framework of 
Russia. 
  Boris Yeltsin will leave Kazan for Moscow once the meeting 
is 
over.

and Nikolay Sorokin] 
  [Text] Kazan, 31 May -- "An example of the economic 
approach to economic management" was how Boris Yeltsin described 
the Mayskiy state farm, which he visited on Tuesday during his 
two-day working trip to Tatarstan. The Russian president also 
pointed to its high profit level and progressive production 
methods in the growing of vegetables. Even so, Mintimer 
Shaymiyev, Tatarstan's president, acknowledged that the 
republican's agricultural industry could not have developed 
without subsidies from the Russian budget. 
  Fatikh Sibagatullin, minister of agriculture and food, said 
in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents that 80 billion 
rubles [R] had been transferred to the republic from the Russian 
exchequer to meet rural needs and, following the arrival in 
Kazan of Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the 
republic's agricultural sector would receive in June a further 
R35 billion in the form of credits. It is evidently for this 
reason that Tatarstan manages to keep food prices lower than in 
other regions. 
  However, Boris Yeltsin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
"these sums should not be called subsidies: Tatarstan and 
ourselves live on the basis of a treaty, and we arrange our 
division of labor and finances in accordance with it." The 
president of the Russian Federation explained the fact that 
Tatarstan has owed the Russian budget R43 billion since the 
beginning of the year as being due to the general cash-flow 
problem. Mintimer Shaymiyev told journalists that, once the 
cash-flow problem has been solved, Tatarstan's debts to the 
federal budget would be paid off.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Bronshteyn and Vasiliy Kononenko: "Leaders </F>
Demonstrate New Approaches in Kazan, While Entourage Display 
Proven Methods of Window-Dressing"] 
  [Text] Kazan -- "I have been well and truly hammered and 
criticized for the treaty with Tatarstan, but I have nonetheless 
proved to be right." B. Yeltsin began his two-day visit to 
Tataria [Tatarstan] with this statement, which had to all 
appearances been thought out in his Kremlin office. In order 
that there should be no doubts as to the correctness of his 
chosen way of saving the federation, the president rephrased the 
sensational statement that he had made in Kazan in 1990 as 
follows: "Tatarstan has assumed as many powers under the treaty 
as it was able to assume. We are satisfied with what has been 
left to federal organs. This is the first treaty of its kind 
and it is important for me to see with my own eyes how it is 
being put into practice." 
  There is every indication that B. Yeltsin is pleased with 
the 
result of the operation of the hard-won treaty on the 
delimitation of powers, which has stabilized relations between 
Moscow and Kazan, and intends to pay attention mainly to purely 
practical matters. 
  In turn Tatarstan's President M. Shaymiyev, answering a 
question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent, also said: "We need 
to strengthen the trust that has emerged on the basis of the 
treaty. In my view, it (trust) does now exist, we need to set 
about organizing the economic relations that are normal for a 
market." 
  B. Yeltsin had to demonstrate the success of the idea of 
national accord founded on compromise. Against the backdrop of 
events in the Crimea, the treaty with Tataria is seen by 
analysts as an example of a well-considered flexible policy. 
Similar treaties are being prepared for certain other regions 
of Russia, in particular with Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar 
Kray, and Udmurtia. 
  B. Yeltsin was extremely interested in the experience of 
crime-fighting in Naberezhnyye Chelny and the republic as a 
whole. (During a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent 
[Russian Interior Minister] V. Yerin did not hide his delight at 
the emergency measures that have in the last year made it 
possible to partially curb young criminal groupings in the 
republic). 
  As for local nationalists declaring Yeltsin "persona non 
grata" in Tatarstan, they believe that the Russian president has 
not kept his word that he gave in 1990 regarding Kazan's 
sovereignty -- M. Shaymiyev retorted with undisguised 
irritation: "Nothing ever pleases them." Nevertheless he 
reaffirmed: Official Kazan favors peace with Moscow, and 
window-dressing verging on insanity was organized within the 
framework of this policy. 
  In this case the hurried asphalting of roads and streets is 
a 
mere bagatelle. Actions on a state scale have been organized 
in places where Yeltsin is staying. Homes and balconies have 
been cleaned, store windows have been done up, and streets 
blocked for days. Thousands of militia personnel have been 
assembled in Naberezhnyye Chelny and Kazan. Regrettably, the 
military have not always remembered their duty and humanity. 
  During the afternoon of 30 May a fire broke out in an 
apartment block on Uprising Street where the presidential 
cortege was to have passed. Despite a large concentration of 
militia forces none of the military came to help a woman who 
leaped out of the blazing apartment onto the balcony. To her 
good fortune the personnel of a store on the first floor 
displayed quick thinking. They grabbed a rug off the shelf, 
stretched it down over the sidewalk, and the girl jumped from 
the fifth floor. She was taken to the hospital with serious 
injuries and burns. Firefighters had barely put out the flames 
when decorators arrived and immediately painted over the soot. 
  Politics is still the main thing of value, not people....

machinery for the implementation of Russia's treaty with

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- A representation to cancel the 
regulations on privatization in Moscow, which were prepared on 
the instruction of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and run counter to 
the current legislation, has been made by Chairman of the 
Russian State Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays to the Russian 
procurator general's office. 
  "Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov has launched a campaign of 
large-scale violations of privatization legislation and even 
fully prohibited the transfer of state property into private in 
the city," Chubays told correspondents. 
  In his words, the Moscow City Committee for Property 
gradually stopped corporatization and sales of Moscow 
enterprises at privatization voucher auctions. The share of 
joint stock enterprises in Moscow amounted to 15 per cent from 
the overall number of enterprises liable for corporatization in 
April 1994, as compared to 62 per cent throughout Russia. 
Moscow is lagging behind in privatization of large enterprises 
as well. 
  The privatization situation in Moscow can be estimated as 
catastrophic, said Chubays.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky May 31 TASS -- The 
Kamchatka naval flotilla has begun to plant mines on unguarded 
approaches and terrotories adjacent to arms depots, a spokesman 
in the flotilla press group told ITAR-TASS. 
  This is being done on an instruction from the Russian 
defence 
minister and the commander-in-chief of the Navy to prevent 
thefts of weapons and ammunition, the spokesman said. 
  Last year, more than ten attempts to steal weapons from the 
flotilla's one facility alone were thwarted. The facility is 
located, incidentally, within the city boundaring of 
Petropavlovsk. In a half of cases, the arms theft attempts 
involved adolescents. 
  Warning signs will be set up near the mined places. The 
flotilla command cautioned all residents of the region against 
crossing the boundaries of mined territories.

initiating group of deputies, began to reflect -- after 
discussion and serious corrections in the committee -- the 
opinion of the majority of the parliamentarians, although it was 
a narrow majority. 
  The journalists asked about various aspects of the work of 
the new Supreme Kenges, and about deputies' assessment of the 
specific measures of the government. Answering these questions, 
the deputy speaker said that the parliament is not going to 
demand the complete resignation of the government as there are 
quite a few lively and knowledgeable people. Nevertheless, in 
his opinion, the Cabinet of Ministers lacks accord and 
unanimity. People whose stance impedes the progress of economic 
reform and the implementation of practical and quite 
common-sense alternative proposals are also working in the 
government. 
  Konstantin Kolpakov, personal representative of the 
president 
in the parliament, spoke at the news conference, stressing that 
there is no major discord between the Cabinet of Ministers and 
the parliament. The main thing is that they strive to achieve a 
dialogue in order to overcome the economic chaos. As far as the 
statement of the parliament is concerned, Kolpakov said, it is 
not quite correct and contains certain exagerrations, but we 
should hope that the statement will be able to promote the 
implementation of the market reform.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Marat Ospanov, deputy chairman of Kazakhstan's </F>
Supreme Kenges, to an unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 31 
May--recorded] 
  [Text] I think we can call the parliament statement a 
historical event. For the first ever, such a statement was 
released by a parliament that was elected by the people. I 
think this is a very timely statement. 
  Second, I think that the executive power should work 
properly 
for the benefit of the people. 
  Third, the executive power and our legislative power should 
go along one common road and find one common language. I think 
we should be able to work together in the future. In this 
respect, the statement is absolutely correct. I think we need 
the impetus to embark on a new road. 
  Fourth, being a new, professional parliament, we should show 
the people that we are able to carry out our own policy. We 
should not comply with circumstances and, by doing so, bring 
more economic hardship and weaker social protection to our 
people. We should aim at future changes for the better for the 
people. All our 177 deputies thought like this. The country 
will never benefit if we do not unite. Our primary aim is to 
work for the nation. Our primary aim is to change people's life 
for the better. 
  We should help to firm up our national currency. Prices are 
increasing. We should curb this growth. We should stop 
irreversible changes in the economy. This is our main concern 
and nothing else. We are not against the president or against 
the government. We have no such aims. We believe our motives 
will be correctly understood.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marat Ospanov, deputy chairman of the </F>
Supreme Kenges, by an unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 31 
May--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] In your opinion, what results will 
follow the adoption of the parliament statement? In particular, 
how will the government react? 
  [Ospanov] I participated in the Cabinet of Ministers session 
yesterday. The prime minister has made correct conclusions. 
This is a quite normal phenomenon. Maybe it is unusual from 
the view point of our [word indistinct] committees. The Cabinet 
of Ministers should aim at establishing contacts with us, and we 
all should cooperate very closely. 
  I personally can forecast that everything will be aimed at 
reaching mutual understanding and constructive cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] The statement talks about the necessity for 
a 
dialogue between all three branches of power. What do you 
think? How can this dialogue be technically possible? 
  [Ospanov] First of all, this dialogue should be built on the 
basis of working contacts during preparation of draft laws.

  [text] The Cabinet of Ministers Presidium session today 
discussed issues which are important for the reform of our 
country's economy. In particular, the course of implementation 
of the governments measures to promote economic policy this 
year, the concept and program of measures aimed at 
demonopolizing the national economy were discussed. A heated 
exchange of opinions took place on what is hindering the 
resolution of these problems. The lack of flexibility among 
heads of ministries and departments as well as of the government 
apparatus was criticized. 
  It was stressed that in view of the serious state of the 
country's economic and social sphere it is no longer possible to 
tolerate such low executive discipline. Draft resolutions on 
the issues under discussion were returned for elaboration. 
Deadlines were fixed for this elaboration. The authors were 
told to display the highest level of professionalism during the 
preparation of the documents and to eliminate mistakes made in 
the drafts. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers Presidium also examined the 
implementation of intergovernmental agreements on transport and 
communications with neighboring southern countries. 
  The sitting was chaired by Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereshchenko.

  [Text] The Government of Kazakhstan intends to firmly 
pursue a stringent financial policy and adhere to the budget 
deficit agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund -- no 
more than 4 percent. Finance Minister Erkeshbai Derbisov said so 
in an interview with INTERFAX after Monday's session of the 
Cabinet of Ministers held to consider changes in Kazakhstan's 
budget for the current year. 
  Earlier the finance minister said that President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's decision to raise the minimal wages to 100 tenges 
may entail a rise in the budget deficit. 
  According to estimates, in May inflation in Kazakhstan will 
reach 26 percent, Derbisov said. In January it ran at 42 
percent, in February at 27 pct, in March at 17 percent and in 
April at 31 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Askar Akayev by Boris Toumanov in </F>
Moscow; date not given: "Kyrgyzstan: A Bridge Between East and 
West" -- first paragraph is LA LIBRE BELGIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Askar Akayev, president of the Central Asian 
republic of Kyrgyzstan, will arrive on a visit to Belgium on 
Tuesday [31 May]. During the visit, he will meet with Belgian 
leaders and European Union [EU] and NATO officials. Before he 
left, he explained to our correspondent in Moscow the purpose of 
the visit and the limits on the cooperation he envisages with 
the twelve. Kyrgyzstan, he said, wants to be a bridge between 
East and West. [Akayev] Kyrgyzstan is currently taking 
only its first steps on the road toward a market economy, 
democracy, and integration into the world community. I am still 
convinced that we will see fruitful cooperation between our two 
countries. 
<H5>  With NATO, Too </H5>
  [Toumanov] What do you expect on the practical level from 
your contacts in Brussels with the EU and NATO? Does your 
country plan to participate in the Partnership for Peace? 
  [Akayev] A few days ago, the EU and Kyrgyzstan initialed the 
agreement on partnership and cooperation. Kyrgyzstan is keen to 
develop cooperation with the military-political union of NATO, 
especially in the field of technical aid and environmental 
conservation and protection. We believe the Partnership for 
Peace to be an important document contributing to the efforts 
toward consolidating peace and security on the Europe-Asia 
continent, and that is why Kyrgyzstan intends to participate in 
this initiative. 
  [Toumanov] You are virtually the only leader of a CIS state 
to support the proposal to transform the CIS into a Euro-Asiatic 
union running along the same lines as the EU. At the same time, 
many observers explain Moscow's frosty welcome for this 
initiative because of its strictly egalitarian nature which runs 
counter to the "assembly of lands" logic that currently 
dominates Russian politics. Do you think this trend endangers 
the processes of integration within the CIS, and how do you see 
the Community evolving in this context? 
  [Akayev] We support any initiative likely to consolidate the 
CIS and we consider that the creation of bilateral or 
multilateral unions in the community contributes greatly to 
this. As far as the "assembly of lands" logic is concerned, I 
must point out that Kyrgyzstan is in favor of a tighter union of 
the new independent states. In any case, it is no longer 
possible to return to a union based on the criteria of the old 
totalitarian system. 
<H5>  Between Russia and China </H5>
  [Toumanov] Since Kyrgyzstan became independent -- while 
maintaining its traditional relations with Russia -- it has been 
unable to avoid the influence of geopolitical factors, such as 
the fact that it borders on China. What role does this fact 
play in regional policy? Is your country concerned about the 
geographical proximity of the nuclear range of Lob Nor? 
  [Akayev] Russia is still our privileged partner in the 
economic, military, and political domain, and we want to 
strengthen and develop this cooperation in the future. However, 
we enjoy excellent and good-neighborly relations with China. 
Kyrgyzstan's geopolitical situation means that we have to play 
a positive role as a bridge linking East and West. As for the 
Lob Nor range, our action is based on the criteria of the 
international conventions directed toward putting a global end 
to nuclear testing. 
  [Toumanov] What role do you think the "Islamic factor" has 
to 
play in the civil war in neighboring Tajikistan? Does it 
represent a real threat to stability in Central Asia? 
  [Akayev] The main reason for the civil war in Tajikistan is 
the fight for power between the clans, a war that began far back 
in history. The religious factor has never been anything more 
than an instrument of this rivalry to which the servants of 
Islam often fall prey. The "Islamization" of the newly 
independent states is very unlikely to become a danger for 
Central Asia whose stability is, on the contrary, above all 
threatened by the lack of a suitable culture and a suitable 
legal basis for relations between the states of the region.

second round of talks between the Tajik Government and 
opposition forces. 
  Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov, speaking to visiting 
head of CIS and Caucasus Affairs Department of the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry Mehdi Mohtashami, called for further expansion 
of Tehran-Dushanbe relations and direct air link between the two 
countries. 
  Mohtashami, on behalf of the Islamic Republic, formally 
invited the Tajik foreign minister to take part at the second 
round of talks to be held in Tehran late in June. 
  The Iranian envoy has also invited Russian officials to 
participate in the negotiations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe June 1 TASS -- A total of 11 big 
underground ammunition depots were found in Tajik Pamir 
highlands during a joint raid carried out by the local security 
units and Tajik interior troops. Field engineers removed a 
large number of explosives, ammunition, rocket shells, 
unexploded air bombs and spare parts for them, mostly of foreign 
origin, ITAR-TASS learned from the headquarters of the Tajik 
Defence Ministry today. 
  The aim of the search operation conducted at the end of May 
was to inspect whether army units of the Defence Ministry were 
ready to cut short possible attempts by the Tajik opposition to 
destabilise the political situation in the area of Pamir 
highlands and confiscate weapons illegally kept by the local 
population. 
  The Tajik Defence Ministry admitted the presence of anti- 
government formations in gorges located in hardly accessible 
areas of Pamir highlands, including in the Tavildarinsk and 
Darvas regions. However, military sources said that the groups 
were not big and posed no serious threat. The local population 
does not support anti-government formations, since the majority 
of the Tajik residents support the present constitutional 
government and its efforts to stabilise the political situation 
both in the Pamir region and in the entire republic. 
  Tajik defence minister, Major-General Aleksandr 
Shishlyannikov, dismissed rumours spread by some Western media 
alleging that there are areas in the Pamir region offering 
serious armed resistance to the authorities. In a recent 
interview to Russian journalists the Tajik defence minister said 
in his usual sharp manner that "the alleged presence of 
thousand-strong detachments of fighters of the opposition in 
Tajik mountains is pure imagination of the irreconcilable 
opposition and some journalists." 
  At the same time the general pointed out that the Tajik 
Government does not intend to remain indifferent to incidents of 
terroristic attacks launched by Tajik militants both against 
lawful representatives of the military, local authorities and 
peaceful civilians. According to the general, detachments of 
the Tajik government forces keep the situation in the Pamir 
region under control and heavily guard the Khaburabad mountain 
road, ensuring the safety of cargoes on a highway connecting 
central Tajikistan with the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region.

Ulmanis urged people to "assess the produce of various press 
editions a bit more critically because they may be attempted to 
blackmail us." 
  The president said this Monday in an answer to reporters' 
questions about the publication of allegations of a parliament 
member being a KGB informer dubbed Varis. 
  He also denied having received the letter containing such 
information as suggested by its author, Viktors Alksnis, a 
former Soviet Supreme Council deputy. 
  "More serious provocations may face the president and the 
government in the future" because the Baltic states and Latvia 
are still trying to gain international prestige, Ulmanis said. 
  The media were acquainted with the letter by the Interfax 
and 
Baltic News Service news agencies.

  [Text] Riga, May 27, BNS -- NATO and countries cooperating 
with NATO held a meeting on May 25 in which Russia said it 
wanted to displace its army troops stationed in Kaliningrad to 
Russia's north-west region, Latvian Defense Minister Valdis 
Pavlovskis said Thursday [26 May] at a press briefing after 
returning from the meeting. 
  Pavlovskis said that the agreement on conventional weapons 
in 
Europe, signed when the USSR existed, does not allow to displace 
troops in such a way; therefore Russia raised the question 
during the NATO meeting. 
  The participants of the meeting decided that this issue 
could 
not be considered at the meeting. Nevertheless, the Nordic 
states' representatives were against Russia's proposal and they 
advised Russia to displace the troops from Kaliningrad to 
Russia's central regions, said Pavlovskis. In return, Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answered that Russia lacks money 
to dispalce troops that far and sustain them there. 
  Pavlovskis stressed that Russia said it was willing to join 
NATO's Partnership For Peace program without dictating any rules. 
  Pavlovskis noted that Denmark plans to include 40 Lithuanian 
soldiers in its army, who, after having finished a special 
training program, would take part at NATO operations in Bosnia 
together with Danish forces. 
  Besides, participants of the meeting said they supported the 
formation of the Baltic Peacekeeping battalion, and they 
discussed political changes and security problems in Europe. 
  After the meeting, the Baltic sea states' defense ministers 
met to discuss the cooperation between the Nordic and the Baltic 
states. 
  On Thursday morning in Brussels, the meeting of the Baltic 
states' representatives took place. They coordinated one more 
time the Baltic states' stand in the first conference of the 
Nordic and the Baltic states' defense ministers, scheduled to 
take place next week in Visby.

  [Text] As of 1 June the most-favored-nation trading status 
between Russian and Latvia comes into force. The Latvian 
foreign ministry press center reported today that a note 
received Monday from the Russian foreign ministry expresses the 
hope that in the near future Latvia will ratify agreements 
regulating the withdrawal of the Russian army from Latvia, as 
well as the social guarantees for Russian military pensioners 
and their family members. The assigning of most favored trading 
status means that each country will refrain from imposing 
unequal conditions on its trading partner with respect to import 
and export customs duties, as well as regulations affecting the 
imposition of duty on goods, transit, and other regulations 
connected with foreign trading relations. 
  The mutual exchange of goods by the two states will be 
increased, effective since 15 March this year, when the Russian 
government set a range of higher import tariffs on goods, as 
export to Russia has become unprofitable for Latvia. At present 
Russia is still Latvia's biggest trading partner. Goods 
manufactured in Latvia and exported to Russia account for about 
thirty percent of the total volume of Latvia's exports. Latvia 
is the first Baltic country to actually attain 
most-favored-trading status with Russia.

  [Text] Riga, May 31, BNS -- The Latvian Foreign Ministry 
is closely studying the issue how to regulate the 
Latvian-Chinese- Taiwanese relations, State Secretary Maris 
Riekstins told reporters. 
  The People's Republic of China diplomats were present at the 
opening ceremony of the new premises of the Latvian Mission to 
the United Nations and the meeting of President Guntis Ulmanis 
with U.N. Security Council officials. 
  The fact is remarkable because Chinese diplomats last 
contacted the Baltic country late in 1992 before the Latvian 
Government established official relations with the Republic of 
China on Taiwan. 
  Riekstins explained the presence of Chinese diplomats with 
their awareness of Latvian intentions to improve relations with 
mainland China. 
  During Ulmanis' trip to the United States, the U.S. 
Government approved the most favored nation status in trade with 
China. "Even a power like the United States cannot disregard 
this country with 1 billion residents and a huge market," 
Riekstins said. 
  On the one hand, Latvia is interested to forge economic ties 
with Taiwan. On the other hand, Latvia has "no serious 
relations" with China, Riekstins noted. 
  Ulmanis underscored that Latvia should seek to form 
diplomatic relations with China, simultaneously looking for a 
correct settlement of the Latvian-Taiwanese relationship. 
  When asked whether China is setting conditions for the 
improvement of relations with Latvia, Riekstins said that the 
Chinsese position stems from the Latvian-Chinese 1992 agreement. 
According to this document, Latvia makes a commitment to avoid 
establishing official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 
  Simultaneously, China is aware that Latvia cannot afford 
sharp curves in the sphere of international relations, Riekstins 
added. 
  Ulmanis claims that the issue of Latvia's relations with 
China is also "an issue of the Latvian prestige" and Latvia 
should avoid sharp fluctuations in relations with foreign 
countries. 
  Latvia established diplomatic relations with China in 
September, 1991. In January, 1992, Latvia agreed with Taiwan on 
the exchange of General Consulates after what China withdrew its 
embassy from Latvia though retaining official diplomatic 
relations. 
  China, with 1.2 billion population, regards Taiwan, with 21 
million residents, as a renegade island province ruled by the 
rival Nationalist government, which fled the mainland in 1949 
after losing a civil war, according to The Associated Press. 
  Taipei and Beijing both claim to be the sole legitimate 
ruler 
of all China. A growing rapprochement between the rival sides, 
however, is observed on the trade, cultural and private levels, 
AP said.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinikka Siekkinen from Tallinn] </F>
  [Text] As expected, the relations between Estonia and 
Russia were a central topic in the talks during the first day of 
President Martti Ahtisaari's visit. Ahtisaari spent most of his 
time today in talks with Lennart Meri, his Estonian colleague. 
According to the Estonian political leadership, some light can 
be discerned in the talks with the Russians, to the extent that 
Estonia believes it will be able to solve the problem of the 
Russian soldiers with Russia bilaterally. 
  This optimism is a consequence of talks with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev a few days ago and of the fact that 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is due in 
Estonia next week. According to Lennart Meri, it would now seem 
that a mediator is not needed. Meri has also told this to 
President Ahtisaari. Meri said that Ahtisaari had, however, 
made a beautiful symbolic gesture by telling the Estonians that 
he can always offer the negotiators premises, light, and food, 
if they so wish. But according to Meri, Estonia will return to 
the mediation task after the last day of August at the earliest, 
if the troops of the former Soviet Army have not left Estonia by 
then. 
  Ahtisaari's visit has taken place so far in a warm 
atmosphere. An Estonian daily even wrote that a new Ahtisaari 
era is beginning in Finnish-Estonian relations.

  [Text] Tallinn, May 31, BNS -- Estonia signed an agreement 
Friday with the Swedish Government on a 10 million U.S. dollar 
loan, the Estonian Embassy in Stockholm said. 
  The loan is part of an extensive World Bank loan scheme 
aimed 
for the renovation of Estonia's heating systems. 
  Because of the large size of the project, part of the loan 
for carrying it out comes from the Swedish Government and the 
European Investment Bank. 
  Estonia signed a 38.4 million dollar loan agreement with the 
World Bank Friday. 
  Negotiations with the European Investment Bank on financing 
the same project are under way in Luxembourg today and tomorrow. 
  The project foresees the retrofitting of a number of 
municipal heating systems in Tallinn, Tartu and Parnu toward 
more fuel economy and using of local fuels. The money also goes 
to major repairs on Tallinn's major boiler-house of Iru and 
transition to local fuels in about 40 smaller boiler-houses all 
over the country.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has said Ukraine 
will protect its territorial integrity and the inviolability of 
its borders under any circumstances. The president and the 
parliament of Ukraine will do everything in order to prevent a 
breach of territorial integrity, discuss all disputable issues 
with Crimea and settle the issue without conflicts, he pointed 
out at his joint news conference with Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel in Kiev Tuesday. 
  Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is staying in Kiev on an 
official visit. 
  Kiev's ultimatum to Crimea demanding the Crimean legislature 
reconsider its decision to re-enact the Constitution of May 6 
1992 expired on May 30. The Constitution provides for dual 
citizenship and treaty-based relations between Ukraine and 
Crimea, which is unacceptable for Kiev. 
  Commenting on the situation in Crimea, Demirel described it 
as "Ukraine's internal affair" pointing out he had a high 
opinion of Leonid Kravchuk's position.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has stated that Turkey 
and the Ukraine share a historical heritage as well as a common 
geographical area and added that relations will develop quickly 
as a result of these favorable conditions. TRT correspondent 
Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Kiev: 
  [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Demirel, who is currently 
visiting the Ukraine, delivered a speech at the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council this morning. 
  In his speech, Demirel pointed out that the Ukraine 
demonstrated its political will when it converted to pluralistic 
democracy. Stressing that those that have faith in democracy are 
not deterred by hardships, Demirel added: The advise I would 
like to give you as the president of Turkey, Ataturk's Turkey 
and a nation which inherited a great and rich historical 
heritage, is that the fate of a country is shaped by its faith 
in democracy. In addition to having all kinds of solutions in a 
pluralistic democracy, it is the only regime where a suitable 
and favorable solution can be found in an constructive manner. 
Demirel indicated that another condition for achieving a 
pluralistic democracy is success in a free market economy. 
Stating that Turkey, which has been implementing a free market 
economy for a long time now, is perpetually in search of new 
pursuits, Demirel noted that the Ukraine should not be 
discouraged by obstacles on the road to a free market economy. 
  Demirel also met Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Ukranian 
Supreme Council, and conferred with him for some time. Demirel 
later received a group of Turkish university students, listened 
to their concerns, and pointed out to the importance of 
verifying whether the courses they are taking correspond to 
those in Turkey. Demirel asked Professor Mehmet Saglam, 
president of Council on Higher Education, that more information 
should be given to the student on this issue. 
  Receiving representatives of Turkish companies in Ukraine, 
Demirel pointed out to a great potential existing in this 
country for Turkish businessmen. Demirel indicated that special 
efforts will be exerted to evaluate this potential. Turkish 
businessmen presented him with a plaque in memory of his visit. 
  Demirel later visited a 1,700-building complex built by 
Turks 
for Ukrainian officers. Demirel will receive the Ukrainian 
deputy prime minister after visiting the Cathedral of St. 
Sophia. The presidents of both countries will hold a joint news 
conference in the afternoon where they will assess Demirel's 
visit. 
  Meanwhile, the joint communique signed yesterday by Ukraine 
and Turkey will be announced today. [end recording]

  [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that he 
deeply regrets that the United States linked aid to Turkey to 
certain conditions. We do not consider this a friendly act, he 
said. 
  Demirel who is on an official visit to Ukraine, was asked by 
a journalist whether this U.S. move had anything to do with the 
fact that the National Security Council did not discuss the 
Poised Hammer issue. Demirel replied: Naturally, we deeply 
regret the United States linking aid to Turkey to human rights, 
terrorism, and the Cyprus issue. We do not consider this a 
friendly act. 
  Demirel pointed out that it is natural to struggle when 
faced 
with such developments, and that the Poised Hammer cannot be 
discussed under such conditions. He stressed that the National 
Security Council did not discuss the Poised Hammer, whose 
mandate will end at the end of this month.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko by Laure </F>
Mandeville; place and date not given: "Zlenko: `Russia and 
Ukraine Are No Enemies'"] 
  [Text] [Mandeville] To what extent did the Moscow 
negotiations make it possible to settle the Crimea question? 
  [Zlenko] The problem of Crimea should not be linked to these 
negotiations. What we discussed with the Russians was the 
question of the Black Sea Fleet. On this point, we made 
progress, but not significant progress. 
  We are in agreement on the partition of the fleet, but there 
has still been no compromise on the question of bases, despite 
Ukraine's concessions. We have accepted that the headquarters 
of the Russian fleet should be in Sevastopol, and that 
Sevastopol should be a Russian base, but Russia is demanding 
other bases, which is not acceptable. We are prepared to make 
arrangements for the location of other port facilities but we do 
not want to have conditions dictated to us. 
  This is our territory, but we say that this problem 
absolutely must be solved and that the status of the fleet must 
be decided once and for all. Second, Russia must force its 
military to accept the law of the foreign country in which it is 
based. The fleet must not interfere in Ukraine's internal 
affairs. 
  [Mandeville] Is it doing so now? 
  [Zlenko] Yes, we think that there was interference in the 
conflict between Kiev and Simferopol. The statements by the 
Black Sea Fleet press center are misinformation and increase the 
risks of provocation in Crimea. We have warned Moscow 
journalists of this danger. Some are spreading rumors about the 
arrival of Ukrainian troops, which I refute. The Ukrainian 
troops which were there are still there, but there are no new 
ones. 
  [Mandeville] With regard to Crimea, [Russian Foreign 
Minister] Andrey Kozyrev spoke of the danger of 
"Yugoslavization." 
  [Zlenko] Parallels of this kind are not appropriate. It is 
true that there is a risk of provocation, but we will solve this 
question. It is an internal Ukrainian problem. We will not 
tolerate any attack on our country's territorial unity, which 
the 1992 Crimean Constitution calls into question. Calling our 
territory into question would not only be a danger for the 
Ukrainians, but for the whole of Europe. 
<H5>  Ultranationalist Machinations </H5>
  [Mandeville] There is a debate in Ukraine on the best way of 
facing the secessionist threats. Some think that the unitarian 
state should be strengthened, whereas others think that a 
federal state would make it possible to avoid losing 
everything... 
  [Zlenko] I do not deny that there are supporters of a 
federal state in our country. But I think that there is no 
reason to move in that direction. All the opinion polls prove 
that this does not interest the population. In my view, this 
idea is being promoted by some determined circles which are 
inspired by Russian ultranationalist circles. Their aim is to 
undermine the Ukrainian state. 
  [Mandeville] It is being said that at the forthcoming 
presidential election, it will be the man in favor of 
rapprochement with Russia who will win in Ukraine? 
  [Zlenko] We must not make enemies of Russia and Ukraine. 
Some people in Moscow, but also in our country, are trying to 
set us against each other, but Ukraine has never turned away 
from Russia, it is our neighbor, our history, it is a special 
partner, the dominant factor in our foreign policy. We must be 
close while being independent and equal states. The problem is 
that there is an imperialist syndrome in some Russian political 
circles, the idea that we will all return to Russia, as before. 
No! There is a new situation, there is no longer any big 
brother or little brother. 
  [Mandeville] Do you fear the results of the forthcoming 
Russian presidential election, the arrival in power of 
extremists like Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Zlenko] This danger has been allayed. But the social 
problem which was their breeding ground remains. It must be 
remembered that the success of the economic reforms will be 
decisive. 
  [Mandeville] What conclusion do you draw from the Conference 
on Stability in Europe? 
  [Zlenko] I welcome this initiative by France. This 
conference was welcome, because it answered the questions which 
are worrying our continent. It put a finger on the problem of 
minorities and borders. It gave a clear warning to those who 
still cherish the idea of maintaining a divided Europe or 
putting up new walls between nations. The conference showed 
that we must think about a strategy for the whole of Europe in 
order to prevent the return of history's demons.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F>
by Sophie Shihab in Paris on 25 May: "Zlenko: `In Crimea We 
Have Chosen Preventive Diplomacy'"] 
  [Text] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told LE 
MONDE on Wednesday, 25 May, that he had come to Paris as a "full 
participant" in the Stability in Europe Conference, and objected 
to the title of "guest or observer." He was conciliatory and 
optimistic with regard to the current crisis in Crimea. 
  For three days now we have been awaiting the outcome of the 
Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Moscow to assess whether Crimea 
has any chance of escaping the same terrible fate already 
suffered by other "hot" outlying regions of Russia, although it 
is true that in these other regions Russia was up against states 
even more vulnerable than Ukraine. On Wednesday 25 May, both 
sides announced that a further wait would be required while the 
experts draw up "in 10 to 12 days" a "detailed" agreement on how 
the Black Sea Fleet is to be split up. This is the fourth time 
in less than two years that Kiev and Moscow have postponed an 
agreement on this problem which risks escalating even further. 
  Nevertheless, the same day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko, who is in Paris to attend the Stability in 
Europe Conference, presented the main points of a solution which 
he considered to be almost within reach: As planned, the 
Russians will keep their major base in Sebastopol, while the 
Ukrainian Naval Command (controlling 18 percent of the ships) 
will be installed a little further, in Balaklava. The other 
bases of the divided fleet will be detailed in "separate, 
case-by-case agreements based on their location." In short, 
they would then get down to the serious business of the 
financial arrangements. 
  For Mr. Zlenko "does not believe" that Crimea risks a 
conflagration, even if "there are parallels with what happened 
in Transnistria [as published] and Abkhazia." These two regions 
of Moldavia and Georgia, respectively, whose population consists 
mainly of Russians or Russian allies, have experienced civil war 
in which Moscow took the side of the separatists, even though 
Russia is now supervising negotiations between these forces and 
their former administrations. In the Ukrainian minister's view: 
"These bitter experiences will serve as a lesson, showing us 
that everyone is a loser when a military solution is attempted; 
you know, the Abkhazians today are in a most unenviable 
situation." 
  He continued: "That is why in Crimea we have already chosen 
preventive diplomacy." He stressed in passing that his country 
had not waited for Mr. Balladur to come up with a security pact 
for central and eastern Europe, in which Russia was invited to 
participate out of decency. Mr. Zlenko again denied that any 
Ukrainian military reinforcements had been sent to Crimea, as 
had been reported and vigorously condemned by the Russian media. 
In Kiev on Wednesday, a delegation from the pro-Russian Crimean 
Government agreed to temporarily freeze the application of its 
virtually separatist Constitution in exchange for the creation 
of joint working groups by the Kiev and Crimean Parliaments -- a 
first step toward federal-type relations. As for President 
Kravchuk, he recognized that "we cannot ignore the fact that the 
Russian majority in Crimea will always tend to look to Moscow." 
  Mr. Zlenko said that Crimea could have a status similar to a 
"special economic zone," but there was still no question of the 
Ukraine becoming a federation: "Our opinion polls show that 
this is not a pressing issue," he said. He described as 
"stories made up by journalists" the reports of cossack 
volunteers arriving in Crimea and similar preparations under way 
in the opposing ultranationalist paramilitary camp in western 
Ukraine. 
  Although these "stories" are worrying, with two Armed Forces 
taking up positions in the peninsula, the Crimean crisis is not 
on the agenda at the Paris Stability Conference. According to 
the hosts, it "directly" concerns only those countries looking 
to join the European Union and which are not already "in a 
crisis situation." 
  Mr. Zlenko and his eight-man delegation object to this: "We 
are here as full participants in the conference, not as guests 
or observers. In this way, Ukraine wants to show that we must 
not continue with the policy of dividing Europe, but should 
instead unite around shared principles those people who consider 
that this, today, is their conference and those who are supposed 
to be on the other side of the fence." 
  Does this "fence" separate Russia and Ukraine? The response 
given by Mr. Zlenko, well-versed in Soviet diplomacy, shows the 
road that has been taken since the swaggering declarations made 
in the initial stages of Ukrainian independence: "I must still 
tell you the most important thing: Russia cannot be excluded 
from the security system that has to be created in Europe. That 
is logical, the world must move on and shed the stereotypes of 
confrontation..."

  [Text] The Command of Ukraine's navy has stopped supplying 
the navigation services of the Black Sea Fleet with technical 
information. As a high-ranking official from the Naval Staff 
told INTERFAX-UKRAINA, this decision was taken because "the 
Black Sea Fleet Command refuses to resolve the issue of jointly 
ensuring the safety of navigation, including exchanges in 
navigation information." 
  Meanwhile, as the spokesman for Ukraine's navy said, the 
Odessa and Nikolayev hydrographic districts run by Kiev 
"regularly give information to Ukrainian and Russian civilian 
ships and to the Black Sea Fleet." "In the meantime, the Black 
Sea Fleet Command has failed to notify us even of the 
hydrographic works to be conducted in the Azov Sea in June, 
though such works must be coordinated officially," said 
INTERFAX-UKRAINA's interviewee.

  [Text] Kiev, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The working meeting 
between representatives of the G7 countries and a Ukrainian 
delegation on what is to happen to Chernobyl nuclear power 
station has achieved no concrete results. 
  The international experts did not commit themselves to a 
specific amount of assistance to Ukraine to build new nuclear 
power stations in place of Chernobyl, Deputy Prime Minister 
Valeriy Shmarov told ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview today. 
"Billions of dollars are needed to carry out the whole package 
of projects. At least four billion is needed to close down 
Chernobyl nuclear power station alone." 
  Valeriy Shmarov said the talks will be continued. He 
described Ukraine's position as follows: "If you want to avert 
danger, help us."

<F P=106> [Interview with Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of external </F>
economic relations, by Volodymyr Skanya; place and date not 
given: "The World Trade Organization Is the United Nations 
Economic Organization" -- three first paragraphs are HOLOS 
UKRAYINY introduction] 
  [Text] The phrase "the world is opening Ukraine for 
itself," which is currently very popular, to my regret, is to a 
great extent associated with the trips of our folklore groups 
abroad and the participation of the Ukrainian servicemen in the 
UN peacekeeping actions in Yugoslavia. However, very important 
developments -- enabling Ukraine not only "to expose" itself to 
the world but to occupy a prominent place in the international 
community -- are often left unnoticed by Ukrainian society. 
  Recently, an event of international importance took place in 
Marrakech, Morocco: Representatives of more than 140 states of 
the world -- GATT members -- along with representatives of such 
international organizations as the United Nations, the World 
Bank and the IMF, signed an agreement stipulating the 
establishment of the World Organization of Trade. In addition, 
they signed over 20 economic pacts. Ukraine also participated 
in this meeting, as a state which is going to become a GATT 
member. 
  Ukrainian representative to GATT Serhiy Osyka, deputy 
minister of external economic relations, who was a member of the 
Ukrainian Government delegation, kindly agreed to fill the 
information vacuum regarding this event. 
  [Osyka] What happened in Marrakech, is, in fact, the 
legalization of a new global legal order in trade, tariffs, 
customs, investment, and other sectors of international economic 
relations, which was achieved by GATT members after almost 50 
years of its existence. The World Organization of Trade is, as 
I can put it, the United Nations Economic Organization. 
  Marrakech-94 enjoys similar international significance as 
San-Francisco and Bretton Woods-44 when the United Nations and 
the World Bank were established. 
  [Skanya] How closely is Ukraine "linked" with this 
organization? 
  [Osyka] You know that participants in the GATT session 
discussed and supported a Ukrainian application regarding its 
membership within the GATT on 17 December 1993. Currently, a 
memorandum -- regarding the foreign economic status of Ukraine 
-- which is a key element in the process of joining the GATT, is 
in the works. Its first version has already been drafted. In 
general, this memorandum is not simply a document. It addresses 
a series of urgent measures that must be implemented. It 
includes an analysis of the genuine competitiveness of the 
Ukrainian industrial and agricultural sectors; the bringing of 
the Ukrainian standards into conformity with international norms 
to simplify international trade and restore fair costs of the 
Ukrainian goods; the drafting of the normative-legal and 
administrative-organizational basis for the national export 
control; and the bringing of the Ukrainian legislation into 
conformity with the norms and principles of GATT, including the 
adjustment of trade, customs, tarifsf, investment, taxation, 
finance, banking, and other procedures with international 
standards. 
  [Skanya] When can Ukraine actually become a full member of 
the GATT and the World Trade Organization? What can this give 
us? 
  [Osyka] As a rule, everything depends on the work of our 
legislators; we should do this as quickly as possible. The 
point is that 125 states -- accounting for more than 90 percent 
of the global trading volume -- are members of the signed 
agreements and conventions. Meanwhile, 21 states -- including 
Russia and Belarus -- are waiting to join GATT and the World 
Trade Organization. At the same time, only a small number of 
states stay on the sidelines of GATT and the World Trade 
Organization. The longer we are outsiders, the more difficult 
it will be for us to build normal economic relations with the 
world. 
  As a rule, cooperation can be developed through direct 
agreements between the states, but this process is so 
complicated and time-consuming that it cannot satisfy us. I can 
cite an example: Over the years of its independence, Ukraine 
managed to obtain a most-favored-nation trade status with only 
three dozen states. When it becomes a member of GATT and the 
World Trade Organization, this issue could be resolved 
simultaneously with all GATT members. 
  Moreover, according to experts' estimates, we expect that 
Russia will receive a most-favored-nation trade status by the 
end of this year. If we do not manage to join the World Trade 
Organization together with Russia, our economic relations will 
be build on a basis that could be unfavorable to us. On the 
contrary, membership in this organization will lift a great 
number of problems in Russian-Ukrainian tariffs, trade, customs, 
investment, and other relations, what will enable us to 
establish a free trade zone and customs unions. All these 
processes will be based on general standards that have been 
tested internationally. Again, we should not have to reinvent 
the wheel. 
  In addition, this will enable us to establish a mechanism 
for 
economic integration with the key trading partners in the West 
-- the member-states of the former Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance (Poland, Hungary, Czekhia, Slovakia....) -- which 
became GATT members in the 1970's. 
  [Skanya] In a word, is the process of joining GATT and the 
World Trade Organization a key step in our economic policy? 
  [Osyka] Yes, and not only from an economic viewpoint. The 
political importance of this step is obvious. The international 
community meets us halfway and intends to help us. In addition, 
the United States is ready to provide us with the technical 
documentation which we should submit to join GATT and the World 
Trade Organization. This documentation includes not only 
consultations and advice by U.S. experts, but also financial 
substantiation for bringing the Ukrainian legislation in 
agreement with the GATT principles and norms and the 
establishment of a national system of export control. We are 
already working on this project.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Defense Ministry and [words 
indistinct] news agencies have distributed yet more 
misinformation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. According 
to these reports, an allegedly 500-strong Armenian unit, covered 
by artillery barrage and supported by armored vehicles and 
tanks, invaded and advanced 5 kilometers into Azerbaijani 
territory and occupied a strategically important hill. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service said that the 
misinformation on an Armenian attack on Nakhichevan is mere 
calumny, the entire responsibility for which rests with the 
Azerbaijani Defense [words indistinct].

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR" daily), 05/31/94 -- A meeting 
between the RA [Republic of Armenia] governmental delegation and 
the Crimean authorities has been carried out in Crimea recently, 
and a corresponding protocol was signed. 
  According to the protocol, Armenia should encourage the 
return of Crimean Armenians, who have been departed to 
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and elsewhere by Stalin, back to Crimea. 
  According to the second topic of the protocol, the Armenian 
authorities will participate in restoring more than 15 churches 
in the territory of Crimea. 
  Historically, together with Genoans, Armenians owned an 18 
hectares fortress in Fedosya, with a port and a customs office. 
According to the protocol, the Crimean authorities allocated 
this territory to the Armenian community and Armenia. 70 
inhabitants, who currently live on this territory, will be 
moved, and Armenia is going to build a house for these people. 
The territory will belong to Armenia. According to the next 
topic of the protocol, specialists from Armenia are to 
participate in the construction of this building. 
  A trade-economic link between Armenia and Crimea will be 
established according to another topic. Among other activities, 
this includes relations between the people of Armenia and Crimea. 
  A huge territory has been dedicated in the central part of 
Simferopol, which will be used as a trade house. A similar 
territory will be dedicated to Crimea in Yerevan. 
  The protocol also concerns the use of Crimean air 
territories, particularly the Simferopol airport, by Armenia. 
Simferopol's authorities agreed to this. On the other side, 
Crimea will be using the Yerevan airport for their flights to 
Teheran and other Eastern countries. Five Crimean ports will be 
used for creating economic links between Armenia and Crimea, as 
well as for transferring cargoes to third countries.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/31/94 -- 
The general situation at the RMK [Republic of Mountainous 
Karabakh] fronts remains unchanged, and no active military 
operations are reported. 
  Nevertheless, the RMK Defense Army headquarters report, the 
Azeri forces shelled the Karabakh defense positions at the 
villages of Talish, Seisulan, Hasanghaya in the Mardakertskiy 
District and Shurabad and Namirli in the Agdamskiy District. No 
casualties are reported. 
  At the same time "YERKIR" reports, the situation at the 
South-Eastern fronts aggravated again in the night of May 25. 
Several Azeri units carried fierce shelling of the Armenian 
defense positions at the villages of Karakhanbeyli and Gorgan in 
the Fizulinskiy District, followed by an offensive attempting to 
recapture a number of important heights. Fierce battles have 
been carried out in this direction. The RMK armed forces 
stopped the offensive and drove the enemy back to the initial 
positions. Thirteen Azeri soldiers have reportedly been killed. 
  Commenting on violations of the cease fire, a representative 
of the RMK Defense Army, Serzh Arushanyan, said the Azeri 
command is unable to completely control the armed forces. In 
particular, they have no power over the units controlled by the 
opposition. According to Arushanyan, this is a consequence of 
the political tension in Baku. This may again result in further 
increase of tension at the RMK fronts, if Geydar Aliyev does not 
convince the corresponding spheres in absence of prospects in 
continuing the war. 
  Using the temporary cease fire, the Karabakh side started 
the 
procedures of exchanging prisoners of war and corpses. 
According to the head of a corresponding department Aleksandr 
Agasaryan, representatives of the Azeri authorities are not 
quite willing to carry the exchange, and prefer selling the 
prisoners to their relatives. A number of high-ranking Azeri 
authorities make great money through this trade. 
  Nevertheless, the Karabakh Commission on Prisoners of War 
and 
Hostages freed 5 Armenians from the Azeri prison, having 
exchanged them with 12 hostages, among them 5 fighters.

  [Text] Azerbaijani State Aide Arif Ragimzade proposed that 
high-ranking members of the opposition People's Front be removed 
from the parliament. This concerned former foreign minister 
Tofik Gasymov and First Deputy Chairman of the People's Front 
Ibrahim Ibrahimov. 
  Ragimzade proposed it this morning when the parliament was 
discussing the social-political situation in Azerbaijan on the 
initiative of Speaker Rasul Guliyev. The situation in 
Azerbaijan has become more tense due to the opposition 
protesting the position of the authorities on the settlement in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Azerbaijani Interior Minister Ramil Usubov laid the 
responsibility for the situation at the door of leader of the 
National Independence opposition party Etibar Mamedov. 
  In his turn, Mamedov blamed Usubov for misinformation of the 
Azerbaijani leadership and for actions of the police which, in 
his mind, were undermining stability in the country. 
  Former foreign minister Gasymov said that Speaker Guliyev 
was 
triggering off the tension since Guliyev had refused to discuss 
the Bishkek protocol on settlement in Karabakh in the 
parliament. This made the opposition take action.

  [Text] Republic's National Assembly continued its session 
today. 
  In opening the morning session, the Chairman of the 
Parliament, Rasul Guliyev, gave detailed information on the 
sociopolitical situation arising from recent violations of law 
in the republic's capital and other rayons. The chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet then proposed that these matters be discussed at 
the parliament. 
  Interior Minister Ramil Usubov briefed the deputies in 
detail 
on this problem. He said that the opposition's attempt to hold 
a rally on 21 May had grave consequences, and he declared the 
participation of some deputies in the organization of 
unauthorized rallies to be against the law. 
  The deputies expressed their views on these events and their 
effect on the sociopolitical situation. 
  After the recess, the deputies continued the debate, 
emphasizing especially the impermissibility of acting against 
the law in the present conditions. 
  People's deputy Arif Rehimzade proposed that 
parliamentarians 
Tofik Gasymov [former foreign minister and a member of 
Azerbaijan's People's Front, APF] and Ibrahim Ibrahimov [a 
leader of the APF] be deprived of membership in parliament for 
aggravating the situation in the republic and for instigating 
people to hold a rally. 
  The National Assembly deprived parliamentarian Tofik Gasymov 
and Ibrahim Ibrahimov of their membership in parliament for 
causing lawless acts, attempting to organize a rally, and 
instigating people to join the rally. Abbas Abbasov [deputy 
prime minister and head of State Committee for International 
Relations] and Gulabbas Kahramanov were elected members of 
parliament. 
  With this, the National Assembly concluded its session.

<F P=106> [Video report from Tbilisi by correspondent D. Keliselidze] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] The introduction of CIS peacekeeping 
forces to the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict may begin 
on 10 June. This has just been announced after a meeting 
between Eduard Shevardnadze and CIS Acting Secretary Korotchenya. 
  [Keliselidze] Today Eduard Shevardnadze had a half-hour 
meeting at Tbilisi airport with Ivan Korotchenya, chairman of 
the CIS acting secretariat. The fact that the meeting took 
place at the airport and that there was no time for the 
traditional Georgian hospitality showed that this visit was 
urgent and concerned important questions. And that's how it was. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin, head of the council of the 
CIS states, had appealed to the leaders of CIS countries to 
examine the question of introducing peacekeeping troops into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone, as he was asked to by Georgian 
Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze and Abkhazian Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba. In order to resolve this question 
then according to procedure, it was necessary to get the 
agreement of all countries in the CIS. Ivan Korotchenya, before 
his arrival in Tbilisi, had already visited the central Asian 
states, and intends in the next few days to visit Baku and 
Yerevan, and then go to Moldova and Ukraine. 
  Concerning the question of a possible date for the 
introduction of peacekeeping forces into the conflict zone, Ivan

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 May -- Apart from the weapons they have 
been receiving from the Transcaucasus Military District (since 
1992), the authorities in the Republic of Georgia have also been 
buying weapons (mostly, firearms) on the territory of the 
Russian Federation and from eastern European countries, namely, 
Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. 
  A small consignment (not more than several hundred weapons) 
of Polish-made 7.62mm-calibre collapsible Kalashnikov automatic 
guns has been imported from Poland, while 7.62mm-calibre 
submachine guns have been imported from Czeckoslovakia and 
distributed among security officers guarding government 
buildings. 
  The largest number of Kalashnikov automatic guns arrived in 
Georgia from Romania. (It must be noted that Romanian-made 
Kalashnikovs are of rather poor quality.) The first consignment 
of (7.62-calibre) automatic guns came in two marine cargo 
containers aboard a Romanian ship and was unloaded near Batumi 
in 1992. Since no one appeared to have ordered the weapons, it 
was assumed that they had been ordered by the government of 
ex-Georgian president Gamsakhurdia. 
  In 1993, Shevardnadze's government imported up to 8,000 
5.45mm-calibre Romanian-made Kalashnikov automatic guns (for the 
price of about $120 each).

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on the results of an opinion poll: </F>
"The Population's Sympathies Lie With the Opposition"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of May, a sociological survey was 
carried out with the aim of establishing the popularity rating 
of political parties. The following political organizations 
topped the poll: The National-Democratic Party, the Republican 
Party, and the Popular Front. It is significant that the Union 
of [Georgia's] Citizens that was widely publicized by the 
authorities and that is led by the present head of state was 
only in ninth place. 
  As can be seen, the population's sympathies basically lean 
toward the opposition. This is also shown by the fact that 
eight of the 10 leading political organizations belong to the 
opposition. This shows once more that society is expecting 
significant changes in the government.

  [Text] Kiev, June 1 (AFP) -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk, seeking to bring Crimea back into the fold, said 
Wednesday [1 June] he was prepared to consider a new 
power-sharing arrangement with the Russian-speaking republic. 
  In an address to lawmakers, Kravchuk said that a new 
constitutional court could be formed within a month to examine 
the Crimean basic law that provides for a Crimean citizenship, 
treaty relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate 
militia force. 
  The Ukrainian leader also held out an olive branch to the 
leadership of the breakaway republic by announcing that he was 
prepared to consider legislative changes that would give Crimea 
greater autonomy from Kiev. 
  "I pledge to maintain peace and calm but only if Crimea 
adopts laws and legislative acts that are in line with the 
Ukrainian Constitution," Kravchuk said. 
  "Only in this instance is compromise and settlement of all 
outstanding issues possible," he said, adding: "There are 
extremely dangerous precedents currently being established in 
Crimea." 
  Crimea, a predominantly Russian-populated republic bordering 
the Black Sea, has stepped up its drive to secede from Ukraine 
and be reunited with Russia since the election in January of 
Russian nationalist Yuriy Meshkov to the presidency. 
  The republic was part of Russia up until 1954 when 
then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev handed over the territory 
to Ukraine as a "gift" celebrating the friendship between the 
two Slav peoples. 
  The Crimean crisis was triggered by the local parliament's 
decision on May 20 to restore a 1992 constitution in a move that 
was viewed by Kiev as tantamount to a declaration of 
independence. 
  The attempt at a settlement came ahead of the June 26 
presidential election which Kravchuk is expected to lose and is 
seeking to postpone. 
  In his address, Kravchuk cited an agreement reached between 
Russia and the breakaway republic of Tatarstan as a framework 
for negotiating a new power-sharing arrangement that would give 
Crimea greater autonomy from Kiev in managing its economy. 
  But the Ukrainian leader stressed that the Russian-Tatar 
agreement did not provide for a republican police force and for 
citizenship rights which he said amounted to a "gross violation 
of the Ukrainian Constitution." 
  He asserted that all law-enforcement agencies and security 
forces must be subordinated to Kiev and proposed that a post of 
deputy prime minister responsible for territorial issues be 
created as well as a parliamentary commission. 
  Kravchuk announced that a 10-judge panel for the new court 
could be appointed by parliament within a month and proposed 
that five candidates be put forward by Speaker Alexander Moroz 
and the remaining five by the presidency. 
  The parliament was to examine the Kravchuk proposal and 
render its verdict later during the day.

  [Text] Kiev, June 1 (AFP) -- The Ukrainian Parliament began 
a debate Wednesday [1 June] on whether to appeal for a court 
ruling on Crimea's adoption of a secessionist constitution. 
  A resolution examined by lawmakers called for the 
establishment of a new Ukrainian Constitutional Court that would 
be asked to render a judgment on the matter. 
  The parliament of Crimea voted last month to restore a 1992 
constitution that allows for a Crimean citizenship, treaty 
relations with Kiev and the establishment of a separate militia 
force. 
  The Ukrainian parliament said the move amounted to a 
declaration of independence and gave the local legislature 10 
days to reverse its decision. 
  In Wednesday's resolution, the parliament recognized that 
Crimea had not changed its position and reiterated that it still 
considered the adoption of the secessionist constitution to be 
illegal. 
  The debate over Crimea's drive for secession came as Ukraine 
prepared for key presidential elections on June 26, which 
President Leonid Kravchuk was expected to lose and is trying to 
postpone. 
  Ukrainian and Crimean delegations met in Kiev following last 
month's parliamentary decision and agreed that they would not 
take any additional measures to exacerbate tensions. 
  Kiev moved about 20 armored personnel carriers in the main 
Crimean city of Simferopol in the days following the 
parliamentary vote but there has been no violence in the region.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Ishchenko: "Crimea's Secession From </F>
Ukraine Is Impossible"] 
  [Text] The conflict between the Ukrainian and Crimean 
governments is currently being manifested by the "shootout" with 
legislative acts that rescind or ignore decisions by other side. 
We asked Ukrainian Justice Minister Vasyl Onopenko to make a 
legal judgment about the quite complex relations between the 
leadership of Ukraine and the Crimea. 
  In particular, he said: "The current situation in the Crimea 
shows that the leadership of that autonomous republic intends to 
secede from Ukraine. The revision of the Crimean Constitution 
and a number of edicts by Meshkov countradict Ukraine's 
legislation and Constitution. The Justice Ministry has 
repeatedly discussed decisions made by the Crimean government 
and pointed out their illegal nature. I have frequently stated 
this on radio and television. 
  The Crimean parliament has ignored appeals by Ukrainian 
President L. Kravchuk to reject their poorly considered actions, 
which are pregnant with dire consequences. The Crimean side has 
chosen the very dangerous path of confrontation. 
  In this situation, it is possible to put the issue of making 
the the Crimean Republic an autonomous oblast on the agenda of 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council. This would invalidate arguments 
by the Crimean leadership that such a move would violate the law 
granting autonomy to the Crimea as well as the law "On Division 
of Powers..." previously adopted by the Ukrainian parliament. 
It was the Crimean Supreme Soviet that first rejected the 
Ukrainian parliament's decisions by voting to revise the Crimean 
Constitution. 
  As for the reorganization of the Crimean Justice and 
Internal 
Affairs Ministries and the Security Service (that has received 
so much attention from the Russian mass media -- Natalya 
Ishchenko), let me say that similar changes are under way 
throughout Ukraine." 
  The justice minister particularly emphasized that "in this 
situation, decisions should be made through negotiations and 
with due regard to the interests of the entire Ukrainian people, 
including the Crimea. We need to preserve social stability and 
reject confrontation. Other solutions to the Crimean problem 
are impossible -- as is the Crimea's secession from Ukraine."

  [Text] Simferopol May 31 TASS -- Crimean president's aide 
Aleksey Baksheyev does not exclude the possibility that gunmen 
of the so-called Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) 
are already penetrating the peninsula. 
  "Their threats to form special units for the Crimea are 
real", the aide told TASS on Tuesday. 
  According to Baksheyev, neither Ukrainians nor residents of 
the Crimean Republic are interested in aggravating tensions 
around the peninsula. People who benefit from these tensions 
are not numerous but they "stir up trouble immensely", he added. 
  "Kiev has nothing to wory about", he went on saying. "The 
Crimea does not look for separation, it just wants to build 
relations with Ukraine on a treaty basis". 
  On the contrary, the situation will be destabilized if 
President Kravchuk imposes his direct rule on Crimea, Baksheyev 
stressed.

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- A total of 350 guards of a 
separate battalion of the Ukrainian national guards were shifted 
to Sevastopol between May 17 and 27. The battalion with 
motorised equipment is stationed on the grounds of an air 
defence unit of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, the public 
relations centre of the Sevastopol Militia Department reports on 
Tuesday. 
  The report notes that Lieutenant-Colonel Igor Kurovskyy, 
commander of the guards unit stationed in Sevastopol, said that 
a decision on deploying such subunits in all the Ukrainian 
regional centres was taken by President Leonid Kravchuk in 1993. 
  He noted that the main tasks of guardsmen are to protect the 
Ukrainian constitutional system and to help border troops in 
detaining border transgressors. 
  In the near future, guardsmen intend to participate in 
measures to protect law and order, which were planned by the 
Sevastopol Militia Department.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Ryabushev report: "Sea Warm in Crimea. Will </F>
Relations Warm?"] 
  [Text] Simferopol -- "There will be no war in the Crimea," 
our correspondent was told yesterday by Colonel General of the 
Militia Valentin Nedrigaylo, Ukrainian deputy minister of 
internal affairs. "We will do everything to ensure fulfillment 
on the peninsula of the Ukrainian presidential edict on the 
transformation of the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
into a Ukrainian MVD Main Administration." 
  For two weeks now Nedrigaylo has been in the Ukrainian 
mission in Simferopol guarded by national guardsmen and trying 
to achieve the resignation of General Kuznetsov, who was 
appointed by the Crimean Supreme Council as the republic's 
minister of internal affairs. 
  "Nobody agreed his candidacy with us," Nedrigaylo said. 
"Kuznetsov cannot be a minister since the Crimean MVD no longer 
exists. He has never worked at law-enforcement organs and has 
not taken the militia oath of allegiance to Ukraine. We will 
not be paying him or his nonexistent minister. Consequently, 
our deputy minister Colonel Chernyshov should head the Main 
Administration for the Crimea at the decision of the Ukrainian 
MVD. The size of the militia in Ukraine is currently larger 
than the size of the Defense Ministry. We could have removed 
Kuznetsov by force long ago and made the Crimean militia carry 
out the Ukrainian president's edict. But we do not need 
bloodshed." 
  Across the road, guarded by the "Berkut" Crimean 
Special-Purpose Militia Unit, stand people loyal to their 
disgraced general guarding staffers from the former Crimean MVD. 
  "Leonid Kravchuk's actions are illegal," Valeriy Kuznetsov 
complained. "He has broken the law ratified two years ago by 
the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments on the demarcation of 
powers between Kiev and Simferopol. Under the Crimean 
Constitution I was appointed a minister in the republic's 
Supreme Council, and only the Supreme Council and President 
Yuriy Meshkov can remove me. As for my pay, I do not need any 
-- my Afghan pension suffices. Moreover, the Crimean militia has 
now begun to be financed out of the Simferopol rather than Kiev 
budget." 
  Each of these generals now has his own version of the truth. 
Their own concepts of honor and duty, their own treasury, their 
own security, and their own troops. And the hardest task for 
them is to prevent gunfire, which could lead to a conflict with 
unpredictable consequences. In order to resolve this situation 
Simferopol and Kiev are impatiently waiting for the next round 
of talks between the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. There 
is relative calm on the streets of Simferopol. But at Yalta, on 
the southern coast, the sanatoriums are still empty and a bucket 
of cherries costs the equivalent of 4,000 rubles. Bread is half 
the price it is in Kiev and a quarter of the Moscow price. For 
the first time the price of fuel has gone down, and the station 
tanks are full of Russian solar oil. If you have rubles you can 
feel good and relax in the Crimea. The sea is warm. Is it not 
time for a warming of the relationship between the politicians 
of Ukraine, Russia, and Crimea?

  [Text] Deputies of the Crimean parliament were faced today 
by the same question as at previous sittings -- the question of 
the republican Cabinet of Ministers. Roman Babayan reports from 
Simferopol: 
  [Babayan] The fact is that almost all of last week the 
deputies, together with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and 
Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, discussed the 
nominations for future republican ministers. But they failed to 
reach any decisions. Each side gives their own explanation of 
this. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov believes that the 
deputies are being obstinate over the issue of approving the 
Cabinet of Ministers because the parliamentarians do not want to 
have a pro-presidential government in the Crimea. Yevgeniy 
Saburov noted that in the very near future deputies of the 
Crimean parliament will try to kick out Yuriy Meshkov. 
According to Saburov, there is a situation developing today in 
the Crimea which is like the September-October 1993 Moscow 
situation. 
  President Yuriy Meshkov is not as categorical as the Crimean 
deputy prime minister. However, after the parliament again 
refused to approve the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers, 
he also stated that the Crimea is on the verge of a third 
government crisis. 
  As for the parliamentarians themselves, they explain that 
they are taking these actions because the people put forward for 
nomination are incompetent. 
  Whatever the reasons, as a result the Crimea still does not 
have a government, and in consequence starting the process of 
bringing the Crimean economy out of the bad situation in which 
it is at present is being postponed indefinitely.

<F P=106> [Report by Volodymyr Prytula: "Nobody in Crimea Would Bet a </F>
Penny on Yevhen Saburov"] 
  [Text] Though the new Crimean power is willing to keep all 
its intrigues and conflicts a secret, echoes of palace rivalries 
are spreading across the Crimea and stirring the Crimean 
residents who are falling asleep due to an inert political life. 
These rumors claim that the top officials from the Crimean 
Government -- President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice Prime Minister 
Yevgeniy Saburov, who comes from Moscow -- are at odds and a new 
government will be soon established in the Crimea. 
  Moscow economist Yevgeniy Saburov, who was not recognized in 
his own state, came to the Crimea at the recommendation of 
Sergey Stankevich, a friend of Yuriy Meshkov. However, local 
observers believe that Yuriy Meshkov chose Stankevich for his 
friend only because he needed to create his own democratic 
image. Meshkov also chose Saburov because the latter was born 
in Yalta. When Saburov began working as prime minister, he felt 
a strong opposition on the side of Meshkov's entourage; 
especially, on the side of Valeriy Grishenkov who enviously and 
watchfully protected the Crimean president from a "harmful" 
influence from the vice prime minister. In addition, Yevgeniy 
Saburov has repeatedly declared his loyalty to Kiev and stated 
that despite his nationality, he is against the reconsideration 
of border issues. 
  Given any opportunity, this Moscow expert demonstrated his 
willingness to promote reforms. On the eve of the elections, 
according to his reformer's inclinations, Yevgeniy Saburov 
abolished state subsidies on bread and drafted a resolution, to 
be signed by the Crimean president, to introduce a single legal 
tender -- the karbovanets -- on the territory of the Crimea. 
This, however, does not match the president's election promises 
regarding the immediate introduction of rubles into circulation 
on the peninsula. Rivalry and secret conflicts between the 
Saburov team and the president's entourage, headed by Viktor 
Grishenkov, a former KGB officer, ended by breaking up the 
office and the dismissal of almost all of its officers. 
Saburov's victory was absolute: Moscow resident Viktor Minin 
was nominated to the post of minister for state service -- 
responsible for the government's and president's offices -- who, 
when meeting with journalists, declared that his primary task is 
to be a mediator between Meshkov and Saburov and smooth their 
conflicts. The fact that Meshkov abolished the resolution, 
which had already been signed by Saburov -- regarding the 
increase in prices for bread and cereal products -- signals that 
these contradictions are rather serious. Saburov has harshly 
reacted to this presidential move: "Despite whatever political 
motives populism is triggered by, it will bring no good." 
  Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov tolerates Yevgeniy Saburov because 
he needs him. However, the Crimean leader feels more 
comfortable when he meets and discusses various issues with Oleg 
Rumyantsev, former Russian people's deputy and head of the 
constitutional commission of the Russian Federation, who 
promised to draft a concept on the state and legal building in 
the Crimea. Commenting on these Meshkov contacts, Yevgeniy 
Saburov said enviously to journalists that Oleg Rumyantsev does 
not represent anything as a politician and nobody takes him 
seriously in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that 
Russian advisers to the Crimean president decided to move their 
Moscow conflicts -- between liberals (Saburov) and 
national-patriots (Rumyantsev) -- to the Crimea. 
  However, despite the disparity in positions of Saburov and 
Meshkov, despite the loyalty of the Crimean vice prime minister 
to official Kiev, which was publicly declared by him, we should 
not make him such a devoted Ukrainophile. Simply put, he is 
much smarter than Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov taken 
together. Currently, the Crimea is in the epicenter of battles 
which are being conducted by Russian clans to gain influence 
over the peninsula and the key goal of Saburov is to provide for 
the economic expansion and political administration of his clan 
(Luzhkov -- Shokhin -- Stankevich). This goal demands, first of 
all, that political stability be introduced in this autonomous 
republic. The fact that Meshkov does not understand this causes 
the differences between him and his deputy prime minister. 
Rumors regarding the rapid end of these contradictions are 
being spread in Simferopol. It seems to me that the half-Moscow 
team of Yevgeniy Saburov is living through their last days. 
First of all, this is due to the fact that anti-Saburov 
sentiments prevail among the members of the ruling "Russia" 
faction. So, who will change Saburov? Will this be Rumyantsev 
or Baburin? Or Zhirinovskiy? At any rate, we have many such 
persons here with us.

  [Text] A totalitarian dictatorship is emerging in Crimea, 
built on the basis of open Russian chauvinism. The 
newly-elected Supreme Council of Crimea and the autonomous 
republic's president, Yuriy Meshkov, have embarked on an 
unmasked course towards Crimea's separation from Ukraine. Thus 
states an appeal to the president and Supreme Council of Ukraine 
by Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea, 
formed to consolidate progressive pro-Ukrainian democratic 
forces on the peninsula. 
  The pro-Russian chauvinists and their media, the document 
stresses, are trying to convince people that Kiev is responsible 
for all of Crimea's troubles, and that Ukraine is putting brakes 
on the development of the autonomous republic's economy. Rumors 
are constantly spread about accelerated militarization of the 
peninsula. This campaign has already reached its goal: Fear is 
common among Crimean residents and households are getting 
involved in interethnic clashes. 
  The shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea, demands 
that the Supreme Council of Crimea should be dissolved, the 
republic's presidency abolished, and direct presidential rule 
imposed here. The demands include urgent and fair settlement of 
the Black Sea Fleet problems, withdrawal of Russian ships from 
Ukraine, prevention of the lease of Ukrainian territories to 
foreign military bases, and recognition of the powers of the 
majles as a body representing the interests of the entire 
Crimean-Tatar people.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol, 1 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "I have no idea who 
belongs to this opposition Supreme Soviet." This is how Viktor 
Mezhak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet, commented 
on the statement by supporters of the deautonomization of the 
Crimea, who call themselves the "Crimean Opposition Supreme 
Soviet", which was broadcast Tuesday. He said there is nothing 
new in such statements. "Some Ukrainian public organizations 
have previously made demands for the dissolution of the Crimean 
parliament and for the introduction of presidential rule." 
  "It is incomprehensible," Viktor Mezhak said, "why, 
broadcasting this information, journalists were not interested 
in who created this `opposition Supreme Soviet', who gave it the 
power to come out with a statement in the name of the Crimeans? 
I think this was done in order to whip up passions around the 
Crimea just a bit more." 
  Stressing the desire of the Crimean people's elected 
representatives to tackle all the problems around the 
negotiating table with their counterparts from Kiev, Viktor 
Mezhak said: "We expect the Ukrainian parliamentarians to 
continue the dialogue on settling our relations. We are 
counting that they will come to the Crimea this Friday."

  [Text] Dnepropetrovsk [no date as received] -- Ivan 
Plyushch, a candidate for the post of president of Ukraine, 
noted at a news conference yesterday that "Ukraine needs tough 
decisions now in order not to resort to brutal ones tomorrow." 
In his opinion, the main shortcoming in the state system is the 
dichotomy between executive and legislative authorities. One 
should either grant the necessary powers to the prime minister, 
or the president should head the Cabinet of Ministers, Ivan 
Plyushch said. He is inclined to the second option. 
  Regarding the current composition of the Supreme Council, 
the 
former Speaker observed that he does not find it significantly 
different from the previous one. True, he said, new tendencies 
have appeared in the parliament's work, and if they are allowed 
to develop, the Supreme Council could turn into an 
administrative body. "Something like the central committee, but 
a worse version," Ivan Plyushch explained, and added that "the 
shift to the left" in society and parliament is not a terrible 
thing. He believes that one should not fear communists, but 
Bolsheviks, whose aim is first to destroy, and only then to 
build. With regard to Ukraine's economy, the former Speaker 
noted, it now needs liberalization and evolutionary reforms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports: "Crimea"] </F>
  [Text] A Ukrainian Navy press center statement that has 
been made public has voiced concern over the situation in 
Sevastopol. The statement says that a reinforced tank battalion 
and an antiaircraft battalion will soon be withdrawn from the 
strength and composition of the Black Sea Fleet forward defense 
combined unit and sent to Sevastopol to become part of the Black 
Sea Fleet marine brigade. Being formed at the present time are 
command structures for these subunits, some of whose officers 
have already moved to Sevastopol for permanent residence. 
  It is characteristic, the statement says, that the Black Sea 
Fleet command should make a decision to pull the attack forces 
into Sevastopol with no prior notification to corresponding 
echelons or the necessary coordination. At the same time, the 
Black Sea Fleet command does not tire of stating its intention 
to stabilize the situation, and urges political figures "to do 
everything possible to resolve the questions under debate in a 
politically amicable way." The Ukrainian Navy press center 
statement voices bewilderment and alarm over the fact that "it 
has long been a practice with the Black Sea Fleet, which is 
subordinated to the presidents of Ukraine and Russia as before, 
to carry out a redeployment of forces, to have large groups of 
ships put out to sea." 
  The Ukrainian Navy press center is authorized to make a 
resolute protest against the unilateral actions by the Black Sea 
Fleet command which hinder stabilization of the situation in 
Sevastopol and the Crimean region and stand in the way of 
developing normal friendly relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
The Navy command renews its readiness to solve the existing 
problems in a civilized way and counts on the prudence of the 
Black Sea Fleet command, and of all on whom peace and quiet on 
Crimean soil depend in some way or another.

share it with Ukrainian Navy authorities. 
  Spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy Oleg Chubuk told TASS on 
Tuesday that the radar stops functioning because "the Black Sea 
Fleet has not expressed readiness to cooperate with the 
Ukrainian Navy in running the facility and exchanging data 
monitored in the north-western part of the Black Sea". 
  According to the source, the fleet command has twice ignored 
Ukrainian messages requesting such cooperation. 
  The Black Sea Fleet operates a network of radars called 
"Mars", one of which is located near Odessa. 
  Tensions between the Ukrainian and Black Sea Navies flared 
up 
last month when radar equipment was transferred from Odessa to 
the fleet's main base in Sevastopol without Ukrainian consent.

  [Text] Kiev--Valeriy Sirenko, deputy head of the main 
ecological inspectorate at Ukraine's Environmental Protection 
Ministry, told a UNIAN correspondent on 31 May that the joint 
commission of the Environmental Protection Ministry, the Defense 
Ministry, the State Oil and Gas Committee, the State Housing 
Services Committee, and the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine 
representatives--the commission of which he is in 
charge--completed preliminary calculations with regard to 
expenditures required to restore the environment damaged as a 
result of activity by the Black Sea Fleet. The sum of this 
damage is around 19.6 billion dollars. 
  An approximate 4 billion dollars is needed to resolve the 
ecological problems of Sevastopol alone, with 108 million 
dollars required specifically to regenerate 2,016 hectares of 
land in places where Black Sea Fleet units and facilities are 
deployed and to decontaminate the soil saturated with petroleum 
products. 
  Account should also be taken of expenditures required for 
cleansing the harbors to remove oil and other harmful substances 
that are constantly being dumped into the sea and to improve the 
health of the population that is being affected by the 
ecological calamity. 
  Sirenko said: "The state of the environment around 
Sevastopol 
is infernal. Harbors are polluted with trash and oil. The 
fleet's oil collectors are defunct. The command of the Russian 
Black Sea Fleet, however, has failed to find time to meet 
Ukraine's Environmental Protection Ministry commission."

  [Text] As a result of an international conference, which 
Kiev hosted on May 23 through 25, the Agency for International 
Cooperation and Investments together with the UN Office in 
Ukraine drafted national strategies for technical aid's 
applications, which has been increasingly flowing to Ukraine 
from UN specialized institutions and agencies. 
  UN experts are to be broadly involved in scrutinizing 
Ukraine's technical aid requirements under the thus drafted 
strategies, as well as in assessment of further cooperation 
prospects. 
  A number of technical aid projects are reported to have been 
drafted by UN, which might be reduced to basically two types, to 
wit, immediate capital investment and technical cooperation 
designed to improve and upgrade Ukrainian experts' professional 
skills. 
  The UN-sponsored "Systemic Reforms" project envisages aiding 
Ukraine in development of a national strategic-scope reform 
program based on comprehensive studies of Ukraine's domestic 
prices and markets. 
  The "Human Resource Development" program focuses on 
Ukraine's 
human resource evaluation and social welfare to protect the 
society's underprivileged strata. It also covers health care, 
education, R&amp;D support, copyright and intellectual property 
rights' protection in Ukraine. 
  The "Environment, power industry and resource management" 
program encompasses the following areas: 
  - nuclear safety policies; 
  - the Chernobyl NPP's shut-down; 
  - routine nuclear safety; 
  - radiation monitoring and protection; 
  - Chernobyl victims' rehabilitation; 
  - Ukraine's power industry and fuel extraction. 
  The latter area involves more specialized subprojects 
including "Development of national power industry strategies", 
"Systemic approaches to environmental effect appraisal", "Power 
industry management", "Application of power-saving 
technologies", "Conversion of power industry to coal- and 
gas-fired plants". 
  The program's environmental section involves comprehensive 
ecological studies of the Dnieper River's basin and the Sea of 
Azov. 
  The "sector reforms" project provides for aiding Ukraine in 
its infrastructure's modernization, industries' reorientation 
toward market demands. 
  According to Inna Grigoyeva, Ukraine's chief expert with the 
National Center for International Technical Aid Application, the 
amount of UN financing has not been defined yet. 
  The Agency for International Cooperation and Investments, 
which was instituted in September 1993, is in charge of 
coordinating the West's technical aid to Ukraine. It has its 
representations in Ukrainian regions and abroad. 
  In accordance with the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada's 
resolution, 
it is also in charge of implementation of the state program for 
foreign capital investment attraction, and of registration of 
foreign investments in the state register of foreign investments 
involving the EU and other international organisations. 
  The Agency's chairman is Vice-Premier Valentin Landik.

94] 
  [Text] In December 1993, Ukraine had to pay 70 to 80 
dollars for each 1,000 cu. m. of natural gas to Russia's 
suppliers. 
  As Oleg Akhrimenko, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian State 
Committee for Oil and Gas, disclosed in an interview to 
UKRINFORM, the most recent agreement with the Russian suppliers 
provides for the natural gas purchasing price of 50 dollars per 
1,000 cu. m. set for Ukraine. 
  According to Mr. Akhrimenko, this price reduction was made 
possible as a result of Ukraine's declared intention to grant 
the state Committee and eventually the Ukrneftegaz National 
Holding Joint-Stock Company the monopoly authority to purchase 
Russian natural gas, instead of numerous government-owned and 
privately-run enterprises. 
  As Yevgeniy Sukhin, first deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for oil and gas and Ukrneftegaz's newly appointed 
president, maintains, Russia's Gazprom, which is the virtual 
monopolist of Russian fuel exports, can be offset and 
counterbalanced by only a replica monopolist. 
  Mr. Sukhin, who was appointed to head Ukrneftegaz by 
President Kravchuk's decree of May 14, 1994, asserts that the 
new suprastructure's other strength will be in monopolizing 
Ukraine's transit piping services rendered to the Russian 
monopolist. In this way, as Mr. Sukhin maintains, Ukraine will 
be able to influence Russia's fuel pricing policies toward 
Ukraine posing as a Russian fuel consumer. 
  In this reduced transit charge-decreased gas purchasing 
price 
game Ukraine is reported to have won as much as 350 million 
dollars from Russia. 
  Though Mr. Sukhin refused to specify Ukraine's transit 
charge, he noted that it did not exceed 1 USD per 1,000 cu. m. 
per km. of pipe-lines. However, an agreement is known to have 
been reached between the two parties setting the transit charge 
at 0.6 USD. 
  Ukrneftegaz's monopoly is supposed to extend to Ukraine's 
domestic fuel market. Posing as such, it will dictate domestic 
fuel prices; though, as Mr. Sukhin asserts, the state, through 
its Anti-Monopoly Committee, will rigidly control the National 
Holding Joint-Stock Company and protect consumers' rights. 
Specific mechanisms to implement this scheme are currently 
drafted and adjusted by authorized ministerial and departmental 
bodies, in accordance with President Kravchuk's decree of May 
11, 1994 "On Holding Companies, which are Set Up in the Process 
of Corporatization and Privatization" (see UBN no. 20/1994). 
  Ukrneftegaz's rigid scheme for fuel supply and transit 
piping 
settling may place many Ukrainian fuel and power-consuming 
enterprises on the brink of shut-down, which as the Ukrainian 
monopoly proponents maintain, will facilitate and accelerate 
Ukraine's real transition to genuine market economic relations. 
However, its opponents warn that the scheme can be effective 
only under a stabilized monetary-crediting system, which is not 
the case with Ukraine, as well as normalized domestic settling. 
  Until Ukrneftegaz's scope of competence has been determined, 
which in principle is a natural monopolist, one is left to 
wonder what the State's control over it will look like, if any, 
in influencing its pricing policies. The issue at stake may 
prove vital for many Ukrainian industries' viability. 
  Russia's experience in forming natural monopolists and 
futility of its anti-monopoly bodies' attempts to control 
commodity and service pricing should teach Ukraine a good 
lesson, though. Russia's Mintopenergo monopolist has been 
frustrating the Russian government's attempts to influence 
domestic pricing policies, so far. 
  It would not be altogether impertinent to remind the 
attentive reader that corporatization of the Ukrainian gas and 
oil complex has followed the Russian pattern, replicating it 
pretty closely, though with about a six-month time lag, which 
makes Ukraine's task of prognosticating the process's likely 
consequences easy enough. On the other hand, as analysts 
maintain, Ukraine's and Russia's replica structures, which 
emerged from the former USSR's integral system, may show, under 
certain conditions, their propensity to merge. 
  The former USSR's gas and petroleum infrastructural legacy 
has not been divided yet between Russia and Ukraine. Leading 
the race after structural reorganisation Russia will obviously 
attempt to exploit its advantage and acquire a sizable part of 
facilities, which are located on Ukraine's territory, making 
Ukraine cede them by way of extinguishing its enormous fuel debt 
to Russia. The Russian side believes that Ukraine's 1 billion 
USD debt to it entitles the Russians to claim controlling 
parcels of stocks in Ukrneftegaz's affiliates. As of this very 
day and date, Ukrneftegaz's authorized capital has not been 
determined. 
  According to Mr. Sukhin, independent foreign experts 
estimate 
Ukrneftegaz's aggregate property at roughly 110 billion dollars. 
Guided by the tentative sum, the National Holding Joint-Stock 
Company's president stated the Ukrainian party's readiness to 
sell stocks to Russia by way of the debt's repayment, but not 
cede proprietorial rights to the Russian side. 
  The Ukrainian official ruled out the controlling parcel 
saying, Russia's maximal share in the stocks would not exceed 2 
per cent. In the meantime, the Russian party has been rather 
vigorously pushing its cause. As it may be the case, Russia's 
actions could be provoked by the Ukrainian State Property Fund's 
position, which estimated Ukrneftegaz's aggregate property at a 
much smaller figure than the independent foreign experts did. 
  As Ukrneftegaz's top-placed officers say, the disputable 
issue will become much clearer, when the National Holding 
Joint-Stock Company's authorized capital and foundation 
documents have been approved together with its scope of 
competence.

  [Text] The French Aerospaciale's cooperation with 
Ukrainian space rocketry manufacturers (the giant Yuzhny MIC 
[military industrial complex] works and Yuzhnoe designers in 
Dnepropetrovsk) started last year and involved designing and 
manufacture of small rockets and the French Arian-5 rocket. 
  As of today, four contracts were signed by the Ukrainian and 
French partners, which provide for the Yuzhnoe designers' 
involvement in the following projects: 
  - utilization of SS-24 missiles' oxygen tanks as kerosene 
and 
liquid oxygen containers to replace heptyl and amyl. A contract 
to this effect embraces a seven-month period and is estimated at 
100,000 FF; 
  - utilization of SS-24 missiles and their components for 
manufacture of new small rockets intended for placing satellites 
on low orbits launched from the French space center in Guiana. 
The 300,000 FF contract's term may stretch from six to twelve 
months depending on Aerospaciale's response to the Yuzhnoe 
designers' draft documentation; 
  - utilization of a solid propellant 30t.-thrust engine as 
the 
second-stage booster for small rockets. The 120,000 FF 
contract's term is three months; 
  - utilization of SS-24 components as Arian-5 boosters 
(200,000 FF). 
  The Ukrainian party is reported to have arranged all export 
control formalities. 
  The Yuzhnoe designers' technologies for blasting welding are 
the object of negotiations underway with a view of contract 
signing. 
  The Yuzhnoe-Aerospaciale duet is reported as intending to 
secure the French government's financing of small rocket 
manufacture designed to lift commercial payloads. 
  According to Andrei Zhalko-Titarenko, deputy 
director-general 
of the Ukrainian National Space Agency, Ukraine's skilled and 
cheap labor makes cooperation attractive and lucrative in the 
eyes of French space researchers.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 31 May (ITAR-RASS) -- [Senator] Sam Nunn and 
other U.S. senators will propose to President Bill Clinton that 
the first joint U.S-Russian military exerises within the 
framework of the peacekeeping forces should be held on the 
territory of the United States and not Russia, Sam Nunn, 
chairman of the U.S. Armed Services Committee of the Senate, 
said today at a news conference in Moscow which summed up the 
results of the working meeting between the parliamentarians of 
the United States and the Russian Federation on questions of 
defense and security. 
  The U.S. delegation was composed of seven senators -- four 
Republicans and three Democrats -- highly assessed the results 
of the meeting. "We received enthusiastically the idea of 
civilian control [kontrol] over nuclear and other types of 
weapons of mass destruction," Sam Nunn noted. He stressed that 
the United States and Russia should step up their work to reduce 
the risk of weapons of mass destruction being used. 
  The sides agreed that it is necessary to do everything to 
prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and of 
missile technology. "The United States, Russia, and other great 
powers have no interest at all in nuclear, chemical, and 
bacteriological weapons spreading around the world," Sam Nunn 
noted. 
  Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Committee for Defense of 
the State Duma, called the meeting between the parliamentarians 
of the two great powers a "significant event". During the 
two-day discussion, he noted, problems concerning external 
security and defense policy were discussed. The sides stressed 
that civilian control over the armed forces has great importance 
for strengthening the system of mutual security. "Joint 
Russian-American military exercises are the symbol of trust 
between the two countries," Sergey Yushenkov said. "In this 
respect, the implementation of other programs in the military 
sphere, including the Partnership for Peace program, are also of 
great importance," he said. 
  The two parliamentary defense committees agreed to continue 
the dialogue which, to all appearances, will take place on the 
territory of the United States now.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in 
Russian at 1815 GMT on 30 May carries a 45-minute live studio 
interview with Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian State 
Duma Defense Committee, and U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, head of the 
Armed Forces Committee of the U.S. Senate, by an unidentified 
correspondent. Nunn speaks in English with passage-by-passage 
translation into Russian. 
  The guests discuss topics related to Russo-American 
relations 
and answer a few questions phoned in by listeners. Nunn 
introduces himself and speaks briefly about his military career. 
  The correspondent reports that, as of today, Russian, 
British, and U.S. missiles are no longer aimed at each other. 
Nunn says partnership and trust are growing and adds that 
today's meeting was a step in the right direction. He says that 
relations are developing in many areas. Yushenkov then 
reiterates Nunn's words regarding the end of missile targeting. 
  Nunn says that he, Yushenkov, Lukin, and others discussed 
the 
issue of joint maneuvers. He says they are intended to be a 
small- arms, peacekeeping enterprise and that there is no 
requirement that the maneuvers be held at the Totskoye proving 
ground. He asks why the maneuvers could not be held in the 
United States. Nunn then says that the Defense Department must 
decide these things, but he hopes other senators will support 
them on the question of joint maneuvers. Yushenkov says the 
maneuvers will also help the two sides to train together should 
a real conflict emerge. Nunn agrees. 
  The guests then discuss the arms embargo against Bosnia. 
  Yushenkov reads a quote from Jean Kirkpatrick that the only 
successful U.S. military operation since World War II was in the 
Gulf War. He says that other so-called peacekeeping operations 
have resulted in great losses and says that intervention should 
only be accompanied by military action. 
  Nunn says he does not agree that there have been no 
successful peacekeeping operations. He cites Cambodia and the 
Sinai as good examples. 
  Yushenkov says he is an opponent of using force as a means 
toward peace. He says there are many examples of this 
throughout Russia, and it is impossible to determine who is the 
aggressor and who is the victim in various hot spots. Nunn 
agrees and says that the United States must be very careful 
where it puts peacekeeping forces. 
  The moderator asks the guests if they believe Russia and the 
United States should compete in arms sales. Nunn says the 
United States has not chosen to be a competitor; it has happened 
naturally, due to economic reasons. Yushenkov says Russia has 
reduced its arms sales drastically compared with the United 
States. 
  A listener asks whether Russia and the United States are not 
tired of opposing each other. Nunn says yes, that even friends 
have differences, but they should be discussed together. He 
says the aftermath of the Cold War--in the form of thousands of 
nuclear and chemical weapons in both countries--must be 
remembered. He adds that biological weapons also need to be 
eliminated. 
  Yushenkov says he is not only tired of making war but he 
abhors it. He says that Nunn is coauthor of an amendment on aid 
to CIS countries for the destruction of nuclear weapons. 
  Another listener asks whether there might be a third force 
or 
group of countries that would want to aim its missiles at both 
the United States and Russia. Nunn says he put this question to 
the military in the 1980's to find out the potential of both 
countries to repel an attack by a third country. 
  Yushenkov says both countries' efforts should be aimed at 
improving the effectiveness of the United Nations, the CSCE, and 
the Partnership for Peace program. 
  The moderator asks both guests what they would like to be 
remembered about them. 
  Nunn says he would like to think he made the world a bit 
safer and more peaceful. Yushenkov says he would like the Duma 
to pass a law on alternative military service and an effective 
law on control of the military.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- "Russia, the United States, and 
the other nuclear powers must recognize that it is in their 
common interests to fight the proliferation of nuclear weapons," 
Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, 
said at a news conference here today. At the request of 
ITAR-TASS, he commented upon reports in the British media that 
the possibility of the special services of the Russian 
Federation, the United States, and Great Britain cooperating on 
collecting information on attempts by certain countries to 
create their own nuclear weapons is being discussed at the 
diplomatic level. 
  S. Nunn stressed that ideas on this kind of cooperation had 
been put forward by Senator Warren, by experts of the U.S. 
Senate Armed Services Committee, and by himself a few years ago. 
The senator said: "It is a tragic paradox that now that 
confrontation between the nuclear powers is a thing of the past, 
our countries are defenseless in the face of a nuclear threat 
from terrorist groups." The report that the special services 
have begun to hold talks on cooperating in this sphere is "good 
news," Senator Nunn noted.

  [Text] It is expedient to hold the first joint exercises of 
the Russian and American peacekeeping forces scheduled for this 
summer in the Orenburg region on the territory of the United 
States. This conclusion was reached in the course of a working 
meeting between the Russian parliamentarians and members of the 
American Senate held on Tuesday in Moscow. This information was 
made public at a press conference attended by the Chairman of 
the State Duma Committee on Defense Sergey Yushenkov, head of 
the analogous committee of the US Senate Sam Nunn, leader of the 
State Duma committee on international affairs Vladimir Lukin, 
and Senator Robert Couts. 
  Responding to INTERFAX, Yushenkov indicated that "a campaign 
of protest against the presence of the American forces in the 
center of Russia is being waged in Orenburg and around it, it is 
difficult to conduct exercises in such a situation." However, 
the new variant providing for the exercises in the U.S. "will be 
subject to obstruction -- now due to the spending of state funds 
for the transfer of our forces across the ocean," Yushenkov 
believes. 
  At the same time Yushenkov and Nunn believe that it is 
necessary to conduct such joint maneuvers "as a symbol of 
confidence and partnership between our countries." In 
particular, Nunn declared that "the American people will welcome 
Russian servicemen on their soil."

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 30 May--Russia and the strategic 
offensive forces of the United States and Great Britain have 
taken effective step to create a higher nuclear threshold in the 
world, Lieutenant General Viktor Yesin, head of the operations 
directorate of the main staff of the Russian strategic missile 
forces, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. In his opinion, 
the retargeting of missiles at deserted sea areas, carried out 
under existing agreements, will not diminish the combat 
readiness of Russia's nuclear forces. [passage omitted] 
  Gen. Yesin said that all retargeting operations had been 
completed within agreed deadlines and that they guarantee, as 
envisaged in the agreements, a reduction of the nuclear danger 
worldwide. In his words, this act of goodwill and mutual trust 
does not free the strategic missile forces from the obligation 
to defend the motherland and to maintain strategic stability on 
the planet.

  [Text] Fair play with Russia in the world weapons market 
would not hurt U.S. strategic interests, Sergey Yushenkov, 
chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee said today. 
  He told INTERFAX that Washington's obstruction of Russian 
weapon export, as in the case of the failed sales of MiG-29 
fighter planes to Venezuela, forced Russia to deal with 
undesirable partners. 
  As a result, Yushenkov said, odious dictatorial regimes 
obtained weapons through third or fourth countries and created 
tension for the entire world community.

  This is $25 million less than planned by President Clinton's

Russia will receive a little less than one-half of the allocated 
sum. This is Washington's new policy; in previous years it has, 
on the contrary, alloted Russia first place in determining the 
proportion of aid to be assigned.

<F P=106> [Yevgeniy Bobkun report: "Germany Showing No Signs of </F>
Coming to Its Senses After Pavel Grachev's Statements in 
Brussels"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- "A good man, but dangerous": This is how 
one top NATO chief, returning to Bonn from Brussels, assessed 
the Russian defense minister. The FRG's military-political 
circles are alarmed by provisions in Russia's military doctrine 
making possible intervention in the "Near Abroad." "Moscow 
proposes to move probable conflict on Russia's borders onto the 
territory of the opponent as quickly as possible," WELT AM 
SONTAG writes. 
  The initial euphoria of the participants in the Brussels 
conference quickly turned to dismay when they listened to Pavel 
Grachev, the German general acknowledged. When the guest from 
Moscow reassured his NATO colleagues that the Russian Army does 
not intend to save national minorities in the "Near Abroad," 
everyone sighed with relief. But, when he added: "Unless the 
relevant countries want this," NATO went on its guard. This 
phrase reminded many irresistibly of the "call for help" to 
Moscow from Czechoslovakia and other countries when it was 
necessary to crush popular uprisings in the "Soviet spheres of 
influence." 
  FRG Defense Minister V. Ruehe, who has long advocated the 
expansion of NATO to include the states of Central and East 
Europe, rejected Grachev's proposals to establish a "strategic" 
partnership between Moscow and NATO. 
  Meanwhile, the Bundeswehr leadership has announced that the 
new partners' Armed Forces -- Poland's, for example -- have 
already begun to adapt their structures to NATO's. At the 
request of the Hungarian Government Bundeswehr General Winfried 
Dunkel recently went to Budapest with the same purpose. The 
Baltic states have also approached Germany with a request for 
aid in reequiping and redirecting their forces. In particular, 
they are asking for tanks from the former arsenals of the GDR 
Army. 
  General Helge Hansen, commander of the allied joint forces 
in 
Central Europe, has announced that the first staff exercises 
with the participation of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, 
and Estonia will take place on FRG territory in October of this 
year. 
  It is not only the newcomers who will have to adapt to the 
new conditions of partnership. Germany will be required to 
elaborate new juridical prerequisites for the presence on its 
territory of troop subunits of the Eastern countries who come to 
the FRG with their arms and combat equipment. If, for example, 
a Polish regiment returns home from the exercises, then, under 
the currently existing provision of the law on arms export 
controls, it will have to leave its equipment behind in Germany.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts article: "President Abroad, Army on </F>
Heightened Combat Readiness"] 
  [Text] Reports from Seoul to the effect that South Korea's 
Army and police have been put on heightened combat readiness in 
connection with President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Moscow that 
begins today will elicit an understanding smile from the Russian 
citizen. Experience shows that diverse problems may occur in 
the absence of the country's leader. That is why a state of 
heightened combat readiness is introduced in South Korea when 
the head of state goes abroad. 
  This is particularly understandable now, when there are no 
signs of any easing of tension in the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula. And I think that this fact cannot but affect Kim 
Yong-sam's upcoming talks with Boris Yeltsin. Needless to say, 
our bilateral relations do not revolve around problems of 
security. However, one is bound to see that the problems of 
trade links and economic cooperation are in principle no 
different from those that Russia has with other developed 
states. There is also the question of Russia's debt to South 
Korea and the difficulties standing in the way of South Korean 
investors owing to our imperfect Russian legislation and Western 
businessmen's fears due to the vagueness of our reforms. 
  There is no doubt that attention will be paid to all this 
during the talks. However, the special feature of these 
summit-level contacts between Moscow and Seoul is that South 
Korea now seems extremely interested in cooperating with Russia 
on the problem of nuclear security on the peninsula. 
  Kim Yong-sam's visit is taking place at a time when 
relations 
between the DPRK and the world community have deteriorated again 
owing to suspicions regarding Pyongyang's nuclear program. 
North Korea's leaders have once again upped the stakes in their 
game of nuclear poker. Judging by statements by representatives 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the DPRK is 
replacing the fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor without 
allowing this international organization's inspectors to monitor 
this operation as they would like. It is a question of an 
opportunity to find out what plutonium stocks the DPRK has and 
consequently to determine whether or not it has the capability 
of manufacturing nuclear munitions. 
  The UN Security Council urged the DPRK in a special 
statement 
to meet the IAEA's demands. This elicited an abrupt reproof 
from Pyongyang. In this situation the wave of hypotheses 
regarding possible tough measures against the DPRK is growing. 
In particular, people are saying that the question of these 
measures will be one of the main ones to be discussed at the 
coming G-7 meeting in Naples (the Russian president will also 
take part in it). At the same time military measures are also 
being rehearsed. Thus, during the Rimpac-94 maneuvers a joint 
grouping of U.S., Japanese, and South Korean ships will be 
formed for the first time. Some experts regard this as a 
rehearsal for joint actions in the event of the situation on the 
Korean Peninsula worsening. 
  I will not venture to judge whether this pressure will have 
any effect on the DPRK. But South Korea seems to be afraid of 
further fueling tension. In particular, President Kim Yong-sam 
stressed in an interview with NEWSWEEK that he considers the 
reports exaggerated. Thus Moscow's and Seoul's positions may be 
close in a desire to find real solutions to the situation and 
give the DPRK a chance to meet the IAEA's demands and "save 
face." That is precisely the purpose of the Russian proposal to 
hold an international conference on the problems of nuclear 
security on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul is also worried about 
the way Moscow interprets the treaty concluded between the USSR 
and the DPRK in 1961. In one way or another life itself is 
pointing to Russia as an extremely important player in resolving 
both the peninsula's nuclear problem and other problems of Asian 
security.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Despite some unsettled 
problems in Russian-South Korean economic relations, South 
Korean Government and business quarters display interest in 
developing trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation 
with greater number of Russian enterprises and firms and in 
establishing contacts with the administrations of Russian 
regions, Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg 
Davydov told BUSINESS-TASS here on Tuesday. 
  The unsettled nature of credit relations is the main problem 
in bilateral contacts. This greatly limits the sphere of 
cooperation at the interstate level, the minister noted. 
  Under the pretext of unsettled Russian debts, South Korea 
continues to enforce several secret limitations on trade and 
economic relations with Russia, including abstention from state 
crediting and insurance of foreign trade deals and investment 
projects. 
  This creates some difficulties, especially for small and 
medium South Korean firms, Davydov stressed. 
  Nevertheless, the year 1993 registered growth in 
Russian-South Korean trade turnover which was worth 1.5 billion 
U.S. dollars, the minister said. Russian export nearly doubled 
as compared with 1992, totalling 960 million dollars. 
  Import from South Korea rose by 45 per cent, amounting to 
530 
million dollars. "I state with regret," Davydov noted, "that 
Russian export to South Korea consisted mostly of raw materials 
(98.4 per cent)." 
  On the other hand, a trend for purchasing ready-made 
consumer 
goods rather than industrial equipment became more prominent in 
imports. 
  It is expected that Davydov will hold talks on current 
issues 
of Russian-South Korean trade and economic cooperation with 
South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who will arrive in Moscow on 
an official visit on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "Japanese Embassy Competing for </F>
Title of Most Active in Moscow"] 
  [Text] The new Japanese prime minister, Hata, has taken an 
unexpectedly hard line toward Russia's participation in the 
forthcoming conference of the seven leading powers in Naples. 
What is this -- a new policy from Tokyo or coincidence? 
  After Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, the process of the 
clarification of relations between Moscow and Tokyo through 
conflict and outrage has entered a sluggish stage: It is 
thought that there will be no more surprises, pleasant or 
unpleasant. Only professional Russian patriots still suspect 
President Yeltsin and Minister Kozyrev of harboring a secret 
desire to sell off the Kuril islands. 
  In the president's entourage, beginning with Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, there are no politicians prepared to 
fulfill the provisions of the 1956 Soviet-Japanese declaration 
and renounce either two or four islands at the southern end of 
the Kurils chain. 
  When Tokyo objects to Russia's full-fledged participation in 
the G-7 conference, this looks like an attempt to obtain 
something from Russia by barter. 
  When Koji Watanabe, Japanese ambassador in Moscow, spoke to 
me he protested keenly: The new prime minister cannot take a 
tough line. Hata came to Moscow as foreign minister and vice 
premier in mid-March and talked with Viktor Chernomyrdin and 
Andrey Kozyrev about expanding dialogue between the two 
countries and about Russia's role in the world economy. 
Meanwhile, the future premier was not received by Boris Yeltsin 
on that occasion, a fact which hardly left the Japanese visitor 
with fond memories. 
  The top Moscow leadership has lost interest in political 
talks with Japan. The level of diplomacy has fallen to that of 
Poland. 
  Ambassador Watanabe refuses to recognize that 
Russian-Japanese relations are deadlocked: 
  "From the day that I arrived in Moscow back in January this 
year I have heard the most appalling predictions about 
hyperinflation, disorder, and political destabilization. Not 
one of them has come true." 
  The 60-year old Koji Watanabe is well known for his love of 
an open fire, which he kindles himself, his nostalgia for the 
warmth of Italy, where he represented his country before coming 
to Moscow, and the frenetic energy with which he acquainted 
himself with all the even slightly well known people in the 
Russian capital in just a few months. 
  "I do not know whether I understand correctly what is going 
on in Russia," Koji Watanabe remarked. "Sometimes it seems to 
me that I have understood something but then the next week I 
come to the conclusion that I was hasty..." 
  Russian diplomats specializing in Japan consider Koji 
Watanabe a hypercautious diplomat who avoids improvization and 
adheres strictly to instructions received from Tokyo. 
  The Washington embassy is regarded as Japan's most important 
mission; it has 50 percent more staffers than the Moscow 
embassy. The embassies in Moscow and Beijing are in second 
place. And Tokyo treats its embassies differently. 
  The small embassy building on Kalashnyy Lane used to have a 
dining room for more than 60 diplomatic staff. The Japanese 
Foreign Ministry considered it an unnecessary luxury to pay for 
a chef and the dining room was closed. To make up for it, 
staffers at the Japanese embassy in Moscow have been given three 
weeks' extra recuperation leave. That detail provides the best 
illustration of how the Japanese see life in Russia.

  [Text] Zagreb June 1 TASS -- Moscow thinks that June should 
become the "major" month in the achievement of Bosnian peace 
settlement and, possibly, the solution of the whole set of 
Yugoslav problems, special representative of the Russian 
president Vitaliy Churkin told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview 
here on Tuesday. 
  "We plan and, I think, will soon work on a possibility of 
another meeting of foreign ministers. There is common 
understanding that this meeting should be held at the Russian 
representation in Geneva," he said. 
  "State leaders are interested in the initiative of President 
Boris Yeltsin to hold a special summit on Bosnian settlement. 
If this summit is not held till mid-June, the Yugoslav problems 
will be discussed at the Naples meeting of the G7 to be for the 
first time held as a meeting of the `political eight' with 
fully-fledged Russian participation in political discussions. 
This is an opportunity that cannot be missed," said Churkin.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- "President Boris Yeltsin's 
latest six decrees on economic policy create conditions for the 
promotion of Russian entrepreneurship and for raising the 
activity of foreign investors," Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said 
here today during his meeting with the parliamentary delegation 
of Kuwait. "It goes without saying that these documents will 
help promote business activity in the country," he noted. 
  Touching on relationships between the Russian Federation and 
Kuwait, the speaker said that their cooperation "could be more 
resultative and effective", including in the sphere of 
parliamentary contacts. "Frankly speaking, both sides have 
still not used all the available opportunities," he added. 
  Head of the Kuwait delegation Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, 
chairman of the Kuwait National Assembly, thanked Russia for its 
stand of principle vis-a-vis Iraq, which had unleashed an 
aggression against his country. "We want this stand to remain 
immutable," the guest noted. 
  Rybkin assured the Kuwait MPs [members of parliament] that 
the Russian attitude to the friendly Kuwaiti state was 
irreversible. "We want all the resolutions of the [UN] Security 
Council, linked with the Gulf war, to be fully implemented," he 
stressed. "At the same time," Rybkin stated, "we are perfectly 
aware that it is impossible to live in conditions when there is 
no peace and no war. It is necessary to achieve a situation when 
the two peoples would live in conditions of good-neighbourship 
and peace. The Russian MPs, together with their Kuwait 
colleagues, must do their best in this noble effort."

  [Text] Moscow, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- The official visit to 
Russia by a delegation of the National Assembly (parliament) of 
the State of Kuwait, led by Assembly Speaker Ahmad 'Abd-al-Aziz 
al- Sa'dun, continued today. The leader of the Kuwaiti 
delegation met deputies and representatives of State Duma 
committees. 
  The first scheduled meeting, at which bilateral political 
cooperation was discussed, was held with V.P. Lukin, chairman of 
the International Affairs Committee. The sides noted mutual 
interest in establishing close political contacts and spoke in 
favor of continuing relations at the level of parliamentary 
groups. 
  The activity of the Economic Policy Committee was described 
by its chairman S.Yu. Glazyev, who stressed that particular 
importance is attached to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti 
trade links. He announced that the committee is working on a 
law on foreign trade activity and domestic investments, which 
will facilitate economic cooperation between Russia and foreign 
states, including Kuwait. 
  Members of the Kuwaiti delegation touched on matters of 
mutually advantageous cooperation in the oil industry, the 
military sphere, and the sphere of construction and industrial 
technologies. They called on the Russian parliamentarians to 
adopt as quickly as possible laws which would make it possible 
to avoid dual taxation and expressed the wish that Russian 
companies step up their activity in the Kuwaiti market. The 
guests noted that stability is an important factor in the 
economic growth of Russia. 
  Sergey Glazyev noted that as a result of the economic 
sanctions against Iraq, Russia, had lost $15 billion. The 
Kuwaiti parliamentarians responded that they regard it as 
important to consider the issue of paying compensation for 
Russia. 
  The Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finance 
was represented by its chairman M.M. Zadornov. He said that 
Russian deputies are extremely interested in the experience of 
the Kuwaiti parliament which has proved itself in the role of 
opponent to the government in the budgetary sphere. Also of 
importance for Russians is Kuwait's experience in concentrating 
receipts from oil exploitation in the state budget. 
  The Kuwait delegation held a meeting with the Democratic 
Party of Russia [DPR] grouping, which was represented by G.Yu. 
Karelin. He described the present-day Russian political 
situation, stressing that the DPR is a centrist party and holds 
to a pragmatic line on the economy. The parliamentarians 
touched on the issue of the aftermath of the Iraqi aggression, 
and the speaker of the National Assembly of Kuwait called on 
those assembled not to support proposals aimed at lifting the 
economic embargo from Iraq, since it is not observing post-war 
agreements. 
  The same topic was the subject of a meeting with the 
"Russia's Choice" grouping, led by Y.T. Gaydar. He welcomed the 
guests, saying that he was glad about the nascent formation of 
interparliamentary links and considered the visit to be an 
important contribution to the development of Russian-Kuwaiti 
relations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- The allegations being circulated 
by some parties that Russia is supplying arms and military 
equipment to Yemen are wholly unsubstantiated, Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Press and Information Department of the Russian 
Federation Foreign Ministry, told a news conference today. "The 
Russian Federation is not supplying the Yemenis with 
special-purpose equipment, either directly or through a third 
country", he stressed. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that even last 
year, long before the armed conflict began, Russia decided to 
halt supplies of arms and military equipment to Yemen following 
the exacerbation of intra-Yemeni discord. Russia did this on 
the grounds that supplying weapons to warring parties 
contradicts its principled approach, which aims to achieve the 
earliest possible settlement of the conflict by political 
methods. Grigoriy Karasin pointed out that the Russian Foreign 
Ministry is taking this line in contacts with both states and is 
encouraging them to act in the same way.

  [Text] Moscow May 27 TASS -- Viktor Posuvalyuk, Russian 
president's special envoy of Middle East affairs and director of 
the Middle East and North Africa Department in the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, held a meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Bouez on Thursday. At the meeting they discussed the 
situation which has emerged during the regional peace process, 
in particular, in its Lebanese-Israeli direction. 
  Posuvalyuk said at a press conference that his Middle East 
tour is being undertaken on the instructions from President 
Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He 
emphasised that Moscow and Washington, the co-sponsors of the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations, are constantly coordinating with each 
other. 
  When asked to comment upon Islamist leader Mustafa Dirani's 
capture by an Israeli commando group, Posuvalyuk emphasised that 
the Russian Foreign Ministry is against any actions which may 
complicate the situation in the region. 
  The Russian envoy noted the special importance of the 50th 
anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Russia 
and Lebanon. In this context, he spoke in favour of the 
activisation of commercial ties between the two countries, 
which, according to the diplomat, must be strengthened by an 
appropriate legal basis.

  [Text] Cairo May 28 TASS -- Russian special envoy Viktor 
Posuvalyuk met with Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali on Saturday to discuss the situation in the region and 
prospects for resuming Arab-Israeli talks. 
  The sides focused on Russia's role in the Middle East peace 
process and agreed that it must step up its peace activity in 
the region. They also discussed bilateral relations between 
Russia and Jordan. 
  Speaking at a news conference after his talks with the prime 
minister, Posuvalyuk called for working on a parity basis in 
order to ensure the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan 
Heights and restore peace between Israel and Syria. 
  He stressed that this is vital for reaching an overall 
settlement in the Middle East. 
  The envoy emphasised the importance of the willingness of 
the 
sides involved to achieve progress in the peace process on the 
basis of the principle "full return of occupied territories in 
exchange for peace." He believes that the lack of progress or 
failure of peace talks will play into the hands of forces 
opposing restoration of stability and security in the region. 
  Posuvalyuk is in Amman on a working visit as part of his 
Middle East tour aimed at invigorating the peace process in the 
Middle East. He has already visited Damascus and is expected to 
go to Israel on Sunday. He will hold talks with Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin and visit the city of Jericho for talks with 
Palestinian officials.

including recording of interview with Viktor Posuvalyuk, special 
envoy of the Russian president -- from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] The Russian president's official representative in 
charge of a Near East settlement is now in Israel, holding talks 
with the country's officials. It has to be noted that the 
Russian envoy's talks with the regional political leaders are 
taking place immediately following U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's talks and that the timing is not a 
coincidence. Warren Christopher endeavored to soften the 
contradictions between Israel's and Syria's positions, without 
any tangible success. 
  [Flyarkovskiy] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the Russian president's 
special envoy, has ended yet another diplomatic trip round the 
Near East. I say another, because recently Russian diplomats 
have begun to appear noticeably more often in the region of the 
world's most protracted conflict, while Russian mediation has 
become even more effective. 
  Viktor Posuvalyuk acknowledged that the talks between Israel 
and Syria were decisive. He expressed a merely cautious 
optimism concerning their possible success. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's prime minister, was given a special 
message from President Yeltsin. However, the Russian diplomat 
focused particular attention on visiting the new autonomous 
Palestinian area. 
  [Posuvalyuk] This is the first time in modern history, in 
the 
history of the Arab-Israeli conflict that Palestinians were 
given an opportunity to prove for the first time to everyone 
and, first and foremost, to themselves, that they are capable of 
managing their own affairs. 
  [Flyarkovskiy] And your view is that they are coping. 
  [Posuvalyuk] So far yes, they are. 
  [Flyarkovskiy] Does Russia plan a more tangible, material 
participation now in the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho plan? 
  [Posuvalyuk] We are discussing these issues with the 
Palestinians. 
  [Flyarkovskiy] The point at issue is to give assistance to 
the Palestinian side now, first and foremost, is that not so? 
  [Posuvalyuk] Naturally. [video shows Posuvalyuk shaking 
hands with Rabin]

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others] 
  [Text] The first deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian 
Federation, who visited India as well, reported that at the 
request of the Indian party the visit of the Indian Prime 
Minister Naramsimha Rao earlier scheduled for June 14-15 had 
been postponed for late June - early July. 
  Interfax interlocutor found it difficult to say what 
documents would be signed during Rao's visit to Moscow. "We are 
preparing both political documents and serious agreements on 
bilateral cooperation. For example, we have a protocol on space 
cooperation, there are interesting initiatives in the field of 
military-technical cooperation which, in particular, provide for 
a joint servicing of the MIG aircraft not only in India but, 
possibly, in other countries as well. Now it is still now clear 
what we shall manage to achieve," he noted. 
  Adamishin underlined that "filling up the Russian-Indian 
cooperation with a real contents, which is based on pragmatism 
and takes into consideration common positions of the parties 
(they always dominate) and discrepancies (they also exist, say, 
on the issue of nuclear non-proliferation)" is the main aim of 
Rao's visit to Moscow. 
  In Adamishin's words, "the relations within the triangle 
Pakistan-India-Russia are rather interesting." "India is our 
strategic partner. This was our strategic choice during the 
period of confrontation which preserves its significance in the 
period of cooperation as well. Earlier we could say against 
whom we are. Now we are on friendly terms. This change opens 
new opportunities for the Russian-Indian cooperation," he said. 
  Adamishin specially stressed that "having such a reliable 
partner as India in the Southern Asia and in the global scale, 
Russia should not loose opportunities which improving of its 
relations with Pakistan grants." 
  When asked about Russia's position with respect to the 
dispute between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, Adamishin 
answered: "We believe that India and Pakistan should solve this 
problem on a bilateral basis. If they are interested in 
Russia's mediation let them address us with a joint request. In 
other words, we support a bilateral method to solve any problems 
and do not refuse to render our assistance." 
  Adamishin reported that when he was in Islamabad, the 
Pakistanis said that it would be easier for them to reach an 
agreement with the Indians under the Russian mediation. "It's 
natural that I said about this to the Indians but there was no 
reaction. However, the Indians declared that they approve our 
dialogue with Pakistan, at least they do not show any jealousy 
with respect to it," he said. 
  In Adamishin's words, "under the new situation when a more 
serious confrontation and such crises as, say, the Middle 
Eastern one, do not block it, the Kashmir conflict acquires a 
sharper coloring." "Usually somebody else wins thanks to the 
protracted confrontation between two parties. It is necessary 
that both Pakistan and India understand this," he underlined.

  [Text] New Delhi June 1 TASS -- The Indian armed forces 
will receive a large consignment of much needed spare parts for 
its military equipment within the next three months, Indian 
Minister of State for Defence M. Mallikarjun said here at a 
conference of the Indian naval officers. 
  Supplies will be realized in accordance with contracts 
signed 
during the visits last month by the Indian military delegation 
to Russia and Ukraine. The minister emphasised that shortages 
of spare parts creates serious problems in maintaining high 
level combat readiness of all kinds of armed forces of India. 
They are crucial for the air force, which is equipped with 
"MiG-29" fighters, and tank troops, mainly armed with "T-72" 
tanks. 
  At the same time, Mallikarjun recalled that the spare part 
problem for the armed forces might be eventually resolved only 
by increasing their production in Indian defence enterprises. 
The Indian Government has decided to earmark 230 billion rupees 
for its requirements this year. A considerable part of this 
money will be used to produce military equipment and spare parts 
for it at state enterprises of the country.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Delhi, 31 May -- Russia will soon be delivering the 
first batch of MiG-29M fighter-bombers to the Indian Air Force, 
under a contract providing for the sale to India of 30 of these 
aircraft, in addition to six MiG-29ChB combat training aircraft 
worth a total of 25 billion rupees (about $780,000,000). 
Informed high-ranking Indian sources announced this today, 
saying that the MiGs would start arriving this summer and would 
substantially enhance the combat capability of the Indian Air 
Force, because "they can effectively intercept and inflict 
strikes on ground targets deep within enemy territory." 
  Sergey Anishchenko, Delhi representative of the Russian Arms 
State Company [Rosvooruzheniye], confirmed to the ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that Russia has indeed sent an offer to the Indian 
side on supplying the MiGs, 10 of them for state credit and 20 
for commercial credit. Moscow has had no official response yet, 
however, and Sergey Anishchenko therefore described the delivery 
dates as "too optimistic." Sergey Anishchenko nonetheless 
voiced the hope that there might be some reaction in the next 
few days, given Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's official 
visit to Russia scheduled for the end of June. 
  Russo-Indian military cooperation has clearly been moving 
into higher gear over recent months, after several years of 
decline. In mid-May the Indian Defense Ministry announced that 
in fierce competition with British, French, and Israeli 
companies the Mikoyan MiG aviation research and production 
complex had won a tender to reequip more than 100 MiG-21 BIS 
aircraft which make up the backbone of the Indian air force. 
Viktor Samoylov, general director of Rosvooruzheniye, recently 
signed a series of agreements here relating to building missile 
patrol boats and frigates at the Goa and Bombay shipyards.

  [Text] Sao Paulo May 29 TASS -- Russian Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has called for broader cooperation 
with Latin American countries in various spheres. 
  Addressing the Latin American parliament on Saturday, 
Shumeyko who leads a group of Russian parliamentarians on a 
Latin American tour, said that "Latin American countries deserve 
our efforts to promptly develop effective cooperation with them 
in the spheres of inter-parliamentary activity, economics, 
culture, science and education." 
  Shumeyko informed Latin American parliamentarians about the 
activity of the Russian Federal Assembly and its upper house, 
the Federation Council, stressing that the experience of Latin 
American lawmakers is worth studying and using in Russia. 
  He said that the Latin American parliament and the CIS 
Inter- 
Parliamentary Assembly that he heads have much in common, adding 
that both organisations have a large and yet untapped potential. 
"The closer we are to each other, the more we help each other, 
the stronger and richer our countries will be," he said. 
  From Sao Paulo the Russian delegation left for Rio de 
Janeiro.

  [Text] A news conference took place on Tuesday 31 May in 
the Consulate General of the Republic of Cuba in St. Petersburg. 
A reportage by our correspondent Vladimir Izotov has the 
details. 
  [Izotov] (Felix Leon Carabello), consul general of the 
Republic of Cuba in St. Petersburg, did not conceal the fact 
that the main aim of the news conference was to attract the 
attention of Russian and, in the first place, St. Petersburg 
businessmen toward cooperation with his country. 
  In the early 1980's trade turnover between Cuba and the 
Soviet Union was some 7 to 8 billion rubles [R] per annum, Mr. 
(Caraballo) recalled, in terms of the ruble exchange rate at 
that time. Now it would be excellent if the target of R1.5 to 2 
billion could be achieved, he added. 
  After the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance, considerable changes took place in 
Cuba, the consul general said. Circulation of foreign currency 
has been legalized in the country. Joint enterprises, in the 
first place in the sphere of tourism, have undergone development. 
  The most hurtful thing, Mr. (Caraballo) added, is that the 
place of the Soviet Union in the development of such sectors of 
the Cuban economy as the nickel and oil refining industries has 
been taken not by Russia but by Canada, Sweden, and other 
western countries. 
  In reply to a question by the Radio Rossii correspondent 
about trade cooperation with our country, Cuba's consul general 
remarked that not very long ago an agreement was signed on the 
delivery of 1 billion tonnes of Cuba sugar to Russia in exchange 
for 2.5 billion tonnes of Russian oil. The government of St. 
Petersburg and Leningrad oblast is showing an interest in 
developing partner relations with Cuba, Mr. (Caraballo) 
remarked. The joint (Petrokub) firm is already in operation -- 
it is engaged in exporting Cuban tobacco to St. Petersburg. A 
joint enterprise for the delivery of Cuban medicines to Russia's 
northwestern region will start functioning soon.

  [Text] Stockholm June 6 TASS -- "Good prospects are opening 
up for the development and deepening of traditional 
Russo-Swedish relations in agriculture. We are interested in 
the conclusion of a Russo-Swedish agreement on agricultural 
cooperation," Russian Vice- Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha told 
ITAR-TASS, summing up the results of a Russian delegation's 
visit to Sweden at the invitation of the Swedish Government. 
  "Longstanding and stable relations exist between the two 
countries in the field of seed-farming, in joint ventures with 
the "Tetra-Laval" concern to produce machines for the food 
industry, and in several other domains. The current reforms in 
the Russian countryside open up new opportunities for promoting 
Russo-Swedish interaction. We want to attract Swedish 
investments to Russian agriculture, to the creation of farm 
banks and model farms, which could serve as training centres for 
private farming in Russia. 
  "From this point of view, the delegation's visit to Sweden, 
which included talks with Agriculture Minister Carl Erich Ulsson 
and visits to Swedish farms and farm products processing 
enterprises, were most useful and instructive. We have 
acquainted ourselves with a really highly efficient agriculture, 
based on private land ownership and personal incentives. At the 
same time, we saw that in addition to these important factors, 
contributing to effective farming, the agricultural producers 
needed state backing, rendered through subsidies, which are 
typical for Sweden. We are now setting up a wholesale market in 
Russia, which presupposes direct contacts between producers and 
consumers. This is typical for the West, including the 
Scandinavian countries. I believe these are the main ways to 
develop Russian agriculture, too" Zaveryukha stressed. 
  Today, the Russian delegation is to fly to Denmark, where it 
will continue to study Scandinavian agriculture.

  [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- "For Russia the Balkans are not 
just a dot on the map, but it has a place in our hearts", Ivan 
Rybkin, the chairman of the State Duma, stated during today's 
meeting with Karolos Papoulias, the foreign minister of the 
Greek republic. "We want very much", the speaker of the lower 
chamber of the Russian parliament noted also, "that there should 
be no hot spots in Europe and even more so that the flame of war 
should not burn in the fraternal Yugoslavia". 
  Karolos Papoulias assured Ivan Rybkin that on international 
issues the positions of Russia and Greece are similar or fully 
coincide and noted that his side is interested in "Russia again 
taking a worthy place in the Balkans, which it used to occupy 
earlier and which it is worthy of by right". Incidentally, he 
admitted that "the European Union countries have committed 
mistakes with regard to Yugoslavia and Greece bears 
responsibility for it as well". At the same time Karolos 
Papoulias stressed that "despite the fact that no-one likes 
this, Greece will follow the same path as Russia in the matter 
of a peaceful settlement in the Balkans". 
  The sides also discussed issues of interparliamentary 
cooperation between the two countries and spoke about the need 
to expand them.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin, Like Bill </F>
Clinton, Understands That Money Is More Important Than Human 
Rights. Russian Premier's Visit to Beijing Crowned With Series 
of Agreements"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Beijing 
has been crowned with the signing of a series of agreements 
which are designed to ease the development of trade and economic 
cooperation as well as contacts between the two countries' 
citizens. 
  The accords envisage that citizens be exempt from dual 
taxation, prescribe a procedure for border transit and ties 
between border services, and determine measures for the 
protection of the environment, the exploitation of the resources 
of rivers on the border, and the development of maritime 
shipping. A separate document regulates the exchange of 
information and experience in agriculture. 
  In the opinion of members of the Russian delegation, these 
agreements could help our state enterprises and private business 
become established in the gigantic Chinese market. Indeed, this 
is the main point of our premier's visit to the PRC. 
  Meeting with representatives of Chinese business circles, he 
tried to show that there is no reason to be afraid of investing 
money in Russia and concluding large-scale contracts with it. 
Whether or not he managed to convince his audience, people used 
to the unpredictability of the political and economic situation 
in our country, is unclear. In any event, the legal basis for 
cooperation was determined by the signing of the new documents. 
  Admittedly, the competition for the Chinese market is 
becoming increasingly intense. That is the reason for the U.S. 
President's sensational decision to abandon the linkage between 
the observance of human rights and terms of trade with China. 
  For Russia, of course, which has a border with China, 
relations with it are even more important than for the United 
States. It is no wonder that in conversation with the Chinese, 
as sources report, the head of our government avoided subjects 
which they find sensitive, such as the violation of human 
rights. This decision made it possible to promote Russian 
economic interests, at least in those areas where fierce 
competition is not in evidence yet -- in the supply of the 
latest types of military hardware. The United States and other 
Western countries are still observing the embargo in this field 
imposed on China after the suppression of the demonstrations in 
Tiananmen Square. 
  According to some information, particularly intensive talks 
were held on new supplies of Russian fighters and the transfer 
of aircraft construction technology.

<F P=106> [Mulatov commentary; from the "Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" </F>
program] 
  [Text] A delegation of the Russian Federation Government 
headed by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is continuing its official 
visit to China. Chinese, Russian, and international mass media 
are giving wide publicity to the visit and the Russian-Chinese 
talks on expanding cooperation in economic and other fields. 
  Our station commentator Mulatov comments: The focus of the 
ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing is to expand and 
improve economic cooperation and trade between these two 
neighbors, and implement modernization. A slew of major 
agreements in this regard has been signed. A dispatch from 
Beijing by Japan's KYODO news agency takes note of the broad 
representational nature of the delegation headed by Russian 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, pointing out that many members of 
the delegation are leaders of government ministries and 
competent departments, and representatives of business circles. 
As everybody knows, Russian-Chinese trade has grown rapidly in 
recent years. The two sides, however, are proceeding from this 
understanding: that is, bilateral cooperative ties and the 
potential for cooperation are far from being fully utilized. 
The fact that Russia and China are neighbors and their 
economies are mutually complementary will enable them to greatly 
expand all-round cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefits. Pointing out the growing ties in military technology 
between Russia and China, some mass media in the West have not 
ruled out the possibility of an accord on Russian-Chinese 
military cooperation. However, prior to the Russian 
Government's departure for China, (Beleiyi), a ranking official 
of the Russian Foreign Ministry refuted such predictions. He 
told an ITAR-TASS reporter that no military agreement whatsoever 
would be signed. 
  The ongoing Russian-Chinese talks in Beijing are aimed at, 
first of all, upgrading mutually beneficial economic cooperation 
and trade between the two neighbors. Certainly, the two sides 
will also discuss regional and international issues of mutual 
interest. We will soon find out the specifics of bilateral 
agreements reached between the two sides. These agreements are 
designed to create more favorable conditions for mutually 
beneficial trade, economic, and scientific and technological 
exchanges between the two nations. Russian-Chinese dialogue will 
resume at the highest level this fall when PRC President Jiang 
Zemin makes an official visit to Russia. All in all, for China, 
1994 could be described as the year of Russia; and for Russia, 
the year of China.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mulatov from the "Half an Hour With Wang </F>
Xiao" program] 
  [Text] Ren Jianxin, president of China's Supreme People's 
Court, said last Saturday [21 May] at a meeting of the Central 
Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security -- 
which he heads -- that social tensions have increased in China's 
rural areas as a result of price rises, inflation, and 
increasing market competition. The masses are very 
dissatisfied. Some rural regions even experienced serious 
difficulties in maintaining public order. The meeting discussed 
the growing problem of maintaining public order in China's rural 
areas. 
  Ren Jianxin, a senior cadre of China, emphasized that the 
impact that rural areas' public security problems will have on 
the situation nationwide must never be underestimated. A system 
of rural cadres assuming personal responsibility for maintaining 
public order is being formulated in accordance with his proposal. 
  Of late, China's leaders are deeply worried about the 
situation in rural areas. For this reason, the State Council 
promulgated a poverty alleviation plan not long ago. According 
to official statistics, 80 million peasants in China are living 
below the poverty line. Their annual income is under U.S.$100. 
In other words, they do not have enough to eat and wear. The 
goal of the government plan is to eliminate, by and large, 
poverty in China by the year 2000. This and the new measures 
the authorities have taken to improve public order in rural 
areas are two sides of a policy that is designed to prevent 
massive peasant unrest, which could lead to social and political 
instability and chaos. Foreign wire services such as AFP and 
REUTERS noted in their comments that local party committees and 
administrative organs in some rural areas of China have become 
paralyzed or semi-paralyzed. This is exactly the situation 
foreign observers love to cite in interpreting why the Chinese 
central authorities are implementing the system of rural cadres 
assuming responsibility for maintaining public order in their 
respective localities. 
  Reform, development, and stability -- these are the main 
goals of the domestic policy offensive of the Chinese 
leadership. The task facing Chinese leadership is to contain, 
dilute, and eventually eliminate the destabilizing factors in 
rural areas. It is particular true of poverty-stricken areas 
where increases in peasant income are lagging behind the 
inflation rate, and of areas with wide gaps between rich and 
poor, where rich farmers sharply contrast with poor ones. This 
is the kind of situation that could lead to deadly consequences. 
Taking note of this danger in good time, the Chinese 
authorities have implemented comprehensive measures to ensure 
public order and security in the unsteady rural areas.

  [Text] Russia is ready to hand over the nuclear test range 
near Kurchatov to Kazakhstan as of 1 June. The Kurchatov test 
range was used for nuclear tests from 1949 until 1991, when the 
moratorium on nuclear arms tests was introduced. 
  Kazakhstan proposes to turn Kurchatov into an international 
center for radiological, engineering, and medical research.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 31 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Latvian Prime Minister 
Valdis Birkavs visited the Russian strategic installation near 
Ventspils Monday -- the space communication center, or to be 
more precise, the former space communication center, since the 
part which received satellite information has already been 
removed. But there remains a unique parabolic antenna, 32 
meters in diameter, which does not exist anywhere else in 
northern Europe and of which there are only 10 in the whole 
world. The engineers and constructors who built this complex 22 
years ago won state prizes for it. 
  Scientists in Russia and Latvia want to set up an 
international radio astronomy center here and signed a protocol 
of intentions a month ago. They believe specialists from many 
countries could use the scientific center for a wide range of 
fundamental and applied research. 
  It was the scientists who prompted the prime minister to 
visit the military center, which the Russian army will have left 
by 1 August. The costs must be weighed first and then a 
decision made as to whether Latvia has the means to maintain the 
complex, Valdis Birkavs said. "There are so far no grounds for 
going ahead," he said, adding that he is quite skeptical about 
the country having the means. 
  The Russian Academy of Sciences is offering to pay the main 
part of the bill in a joint venture. And it has been made clear 
that the complex cannot serve a military purpose since the 
special apparatus has been dismantled. But Latvia is not happy 
with the idea of Russian participation, viewing many of Russia's 
initiatives as a way of maintaining influence. A number of 
Russian specialists say the issue is being dragged out 
deliberately, so that this unique complex will just fall into 
Latvia's hands when the Russian military unit leaves. Some have 
expressed the fear that the antenna could be used against 
Russia's interests. 
  Representatives of the Russian Defense Ministry have said 
that if by July Latvia has still not made a decision to use the 
complex, everything will have to be dismantled. It will not be 
possible to recreate this enormous rotating dish to the same 
standard elsewhere, which would mean, regrettably, that no one 
would have the antenna.

<F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau May 31 TASS -- Igor Smirnov, president of 
the unrecognised Dniester republic, extended on Tuesday, by his 
decree, the state of emergency in the republic by another month, 
which was imposed on last January 18. 
  The document notes that this was done "to strengthen 
statehood, public security and to control organised crime". 
  Speaking on Monday evening over local television, Smirnov 
said that a terrorist act, as a result of which Dniester 
Prosecutor Boris Luchik was seriously wounded and his wife 
killed, was another reason to stiffen measures on crime control. 
  In the opinion of the Dniester leader, some quarters in 
Moldavia [Moldova] were interested in the prosecutor's 
assassination and an attempt to destabilise the situation in the 
Dniester left bank areas (where the Dniester republic is 
situated). 
  According to the president, they bring pressure on Tiraspol, 
including economic one, together with some representatives from 
the Russian leadership [sentence as received]. 
  The aim of these actions is to force the Dniester leaders to 
make concessions on the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army, its 
property and settlement of the Dniester problem, Smirnov said. 
  He blamed Moscow and Chisinau for the difficult financial 
situation in the region. 
  According to Smirnov, the Russian leadership did not permit 
to take Dniester coupons, the new currency issued at the Russian 
mint. This money is very necessary to pay pensions and wages to 
Dniester citizens. 
  Smirnov confirmed that the Dniester republic has currency 
accounts at banks of Austria and other European countries.

  [Text] Moscow, May 23, RIA -- "Members of the Russian 
parliament are monitoring the situation around the Crimea," said 
Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee on 
International Affairs. "I believe that the State Duma should 
support the statement of President Yeltsin to the effect that 
the use of force, in any form, to settle the conflict is 
inadmissible." 
  He said he was afraid that the forthcoming presidential 
elections in Ukraine could negatively affect the situation in 
the Crimea, as presidential candidates might attempt to play the 
Crimean card to prove their patriotism. It would be best to 
freeze the situation until the elections, and to encourage Kiev 
and Simferopol to hold talks and refrain from "war-mongering."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 31 May -- The fact that, in accordance with 
a decree issued on Monday [30 May] by the Russian president, a 
number of populated areas in Malgobekskiy and Sunzhenskiy Rayons 
of Ingushetia have been included in the state of emergency is 
not regarded by official Groznyy as a direct threat to the 
national security of Chechnya. Movladi Udugov, head of the 
Chechen Department of Information and Press, told this to an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent today in a telephone interview. 
  He noted that the preliminary analysis of the new decree "on 
the introduction of a state of emergency in parts of the 
territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and the Republic of 
Ingushetia" has not led to any undue concern on the part of the 
Chechen leadership. Movladi Udugov said that the villages in 
Sunzhenskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons, which have been included in 
the state of emergency zone, are not under dispute. They were 
Ingush before the administrative and territorial division of 
1934, when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was set up. 
  At the same time, Movladi Udugov said, official Groznyy 
considers it unjustified to extend the state of emergency zone 
on the territory of Ingushetia. In his view, "Boris Yeltsin is 
artificially pushing the expansion of the emergency zone in 
order to create tension with Chechnya." 
  Movladi Udugov believes that because Ingushetia is a part of 
Russia, whereas Chechnya regards itself to be outside Russia, in 
principle the Chechen-Ingush border should be defined. Ruslan 
Aushev and Dzhokhar Dudayev have therefore signed an appropriate 
treaty on the principles of defining borders. The borders 
established before 1934 were taken as the basis for this.

  [Text] Riga May 28 TASS -- Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs admitted his former contacts with the KGB. His 
confession on 50 type-written pages is published by the DIENA 
newspaper on Saturday. 
  It is mostly devoted to a story on the years of his studies 
at school and Institute as well as of work in medicine and as 
foreign minister since October 1992. Andrejevs gave "agreement 
to supply limited information on his profession" to "a 
recruiter" in 1963 when he was chief republican 
anesthesiologist. 
  The confession is written in the form of an open letter to 
voters, friends and legislators. Parliament suspended 
Andrejevs' mandate after his name, as well as the names of other 
lawmakers, were found in the catalogue of KGB agents. 
  Addressing the Sejm, Andrejevs asked it to vote for 
preserving of annulling his mandate [as received]. He also 
noted that the Sejm should express its attitude to the post he 
holds: To leave him in the ministerial chair or to express 
no-confidence. 
  The letter's author did not recognise himself guilty and 
noted that, to his mind, "appropriate political forces in Russia 
and, possibly in Latvia, did not wish his participation in the 
signing ceremony of the intergovernment treaties in Moscow. 
  His negative attitude to the agreement on Russian war 
pensioners "did not pass unnoticed by enemies in Latvia and in 
the neighbourhood." According to Andrejevs' opinion, this is 
one of the reasons for making public five names of lawmakers. 

    He said it is an absurdity that former leading statesmen 
whose privileged position had precluded, at that time, a 
possibility of their registration at KGB files, "can again, with 
impunity, occupy top political posts and not only in the Sejm" 
and seal the fate of other "suspects."

  [Text] Tallinn, May 31, BNS -- Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, on a visit to Estonia, met with Estonian President 
Lennart Meri, Parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister 
Mart Laar in Tallinn today. 
  The presidents at their meeting discussed mainly Estonia's 
relations with Russia, but also Estonia's integration with the 
European structures, Raul Malk, deputy chancellor of the Foreign 
Ministry told BNS. 
  The press office of the Estonian presidential chancellery 
said Ahtisaari at the meeting had expressed his support for 
Estonia in the country's demand that Russian troops be pulled 
out from its territory by Aug. 31. The presidents also spoke 
about the topic of the retired Russian military living in 
Estonia. The Finnish leader informed his Estonian counterpart 
about his meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Meri 
spoke about the results of last week's visit by Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev to Tallinn. 
  The Finnish president then continued to the parliament and 
the government house at Toompea, where he met with State 
Assembly Chairman Ulo Nugis and Prime Minister Mart Laar. 
Cooperation between the Estonian and Finnish parliaments was 
the main topic at the meeting between Ahtisaari and Nugis, the 
parliament press office reported. Nugis at the meeting spoke at 
some length about the main problems the parliament is working on 
at the moment. Also discussed were current issues of the 
interior and domestic policy. 
  At the meeting with the Estonian prime minister, the Finnish 
president again clearly expressed support for Estonia's efforts 
over Russian troop withdrawal and the hope that Estonia and 
Russia despite current hardships will reach the necessary 
agreements on the issue. Ahtisaari said Finland will continue 
assistance to Estonia's defense forces, border guard and police, 
Laar said. 
  Also discussed at the meeting were economic relations 
between 
the two countries. Laar said the Finnish president had 
expressed satisfaction at Estonia's economic progress and 
emphasized the importance of keeping up the free trade 
agreements between Estonia and Finland, including the one on 
farm products. 
  Ahtisaari and Laar contended that Finland's prospective 
joining with the European Union would have a positive effect on 
Estonia as well as the entire Baltic region. The Finnish 
president expressed hope that his country's people will vote for 
EU membership in the national EU referendum, Laar said. Other 
topics discussed at the meeting included environmental 
cooperation, the Via Baltica road transit route project and 
setting up a gas pipeline to connect the Nordic region, Baltics 
and Central Europe. 
  From the parliament and government house at Toompea, the 
Finnish presidential couple and Estonian President Lennart Meri 
continued to the nearby Dome Church. The Finnish president 
later visited the Tallinn Town Hall, meeting with Tallinn Mayor 
Jaak Tamm. At 4.45 p.m. the Finnish president laid a wreath at 
a monument in central Tallinn to youth killed in Estonia's War 
of Independence. 
  President Ahtisaari and the director general of Finfound, 
Markku Pekonen, gave a press conference later in the day. 
Ahtisaari in his remarks to reporters again emphasized that 
Finland is and will remain the largest trade partner for 
Estonia, and that this is being positively referred to by both 
sides. 
  When asked by a BNS correspondent whether the Finnish 
president at talks with the Estonian leaders also discussed 
introducing visa- free travel between the countries, Ahtisaari 
answered that the topic had not been on the agenda this time. 
  Ahtisaari declared Finland's support for Estonia in the 
country's strive to join the European Union. The president 
reminded of his country having backed Estonia always when the 
Baltic state recently has worked towards membership in 
international bodies. 
  When asked about whether Finland was having territorial 
claims against Russia, Ahtisaari's answer was negative. "Each 
state must determine by itself what position to adopt as to the 
border issue," he said. 
  Speaking about relations with Russia, the Finnish president 
said he regards it as most important that movement toward 
democratization and market economy would continue in that 
country. 
  Ahtisaari said Finland and Estonia as neighboring countries 
must keep each other well informed. "No political diversities 
exist between us; there are a number of issues that are of great 
interest for both of our countries," he said. 
  The Finnish president also visited the Estonian Foreign 
Ministry and had a meeting with staff at his country's embassy 
in Tallinn. President Lennart Meri gives a dinner in honor of 
his Finnish counterpart later in the evening. 
  The Finnish president's visit continues with a trip to 
Estonia's second-largest city, Tartu, Wednesday. 
  This is the first time since 1925 that a Finnish president 
pays a state visit to Estonia, said the Estonian Ambassador to 
Finland, Jaak Joeruut. He added that the heads of state of both 
countries had visited each other also after that, but that those 
trips had been lower-key ones. Joeruut further pointed out that 
Ahtisaari was visiting Estonia shortly after his election as 
president, which, the ambassador said, shows what importance 
Finland attaches to contacts with Estonia.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- A news conference of presidents 
Leonid Kravchuk and Suleyman Demirel focused today on important 
aspects of Ukrainian-Turkish relations and some preliminary 
results of the Ukrainian official visit of the Turkish president. 
  Kravchuk told the news conference they consider the official 
Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president to be an important step 
in the development of bilateral relations and a significant 
event with a positive influence on the whole Black Sea region. 
  Ukraine attaches great importance to its relations with the 
Turkish Republic and is striving to build bilateral relations on 
the basis of principles of mutual respect, equality and 
good-neighbourliness. The political guideline for the two 
states is the treaty on friendship and cooperation signed at a 
summit meeting in 1992, said the Ukrainian president. 
  The recent meetings and negotiations held with participation 
of Ukrainian and Turkish high-ranking officials focused on 
deepening of the bilateral relations, primarily in the economic 
sphere. Both sides noted that the goods turnover has 
considerably increased over the past years. At the same time, 
it does not correspond to the Ukrainian and Turkish abilities 
and needs. 
  Cooperation with the Turkish Republic is a Ukrainian 
priority, said Kravchuk. Ukraine is interested in the Turkish 
experience of democratic transformations and building of a 
market economy. 
  The Ukrainian president stressed that the meetings discussed 
a broad range of international issues, including the state and 
prospects for Black Sea economic cooperation and ways to settle 
conflicts in the Balkans and the Transcaucasia. The sides noted 
that consolidation of stability and security in the Black Sea 
region corresponds to their national interests, regional and 
European interests, and agreed to coordinate efforts in creation 
of an atmosphere of confidence and cooperation in the region. 
  Mutual striving for expanded cooperation is registered in 
the 
joint communique and other documents signed during the official 
Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president. Kravchuk expressed 
the assurance the visit will give a fresh impetus to the 
relations of Ukraine and Turkey. 
  In his turn, the Turkish president said that the republic 
attaches major importance to its relations with Ukraine, bearing 
in mind the two states are the largest ones in the region. They 
feel responsible for peace and friendship in the region, he said. 
  Turkey also attaches great importance to the preservation of 
Ukrainian territorial integrity and peace within the framework 
of the United Nations and CSCE. Proclamation of Ukrainian 
independence has boosted the development of Ukrainian-Turkish 
relations, he said. 
  The president is sure that his visit will boost cooperation. 
The Ukrainian-Turkish goods turnover exceeds 500 million U.S. 
dollars, and they hope to make it one billion. Ukrainian and 
Turkish businessmen are forming a cooperation union and have 
started to look for new ways in economy and trade. 
  The president is convinced that new possibilities for the 
expansion of mutually beneficial relations will be created. 
  The presidents answered numerous questions of 
correspondents.

  [Text] Kiev, 1ST Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Ukrainian Supreme 
Council should adopt decisions that would be proportionate to 
the current situation in relations between Ukraine and the 
Republic of Crimea", Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said 
today in an address to the Ukrainian parliament. 
  In his view, "the political forces that have proclaimed the 
secession of the Republic of Crimea from Ukraine and its merger 
with the Russian Federation have now gained power in the 
autonomous republic." He believes that the Crimean leaders have 
chosen two routes. The first is the adoption of a constitution 
that proposes to proclaim the Crimean autonomy an independent 
state, and the second is to restore the old Soviet Union, which 
is impracticable. He believes that the conclusion should be 
unambiguous: The Crimean issue ought to be solved only in the 
framework of the Ukrainian Constitution, the president stressed. 
"We must do it," Leonid Kravchuk said. 
  He made the proposal to immediately form the Ukrainian 
Constitutional Court, which should repeal all decisions of the 
Crimean parliament and president contradicting the laws of the 
Ukrainian state. He also proposed making amendments and 
addendums to the Ukrainian Constitution, to the law on 
demarcation of powers between the Ukraine and the Republic of 
the Crimea, in which it is to be clearly defined that the 
Crimean autonomous entity is the territory of the Ukrainian 
state. In the opinion of the president of Ukraine, all power 
ministries of the Crimea should also be subordinated to Kiev. 
It is also important to settle budgetary relations. "Now we 
must take the most radical measures to stabilize the situation, 
because the consequences could be even worse," Leonid Kravchuk 
stressed. And this needs to be done in the framework of the 
Constitution, be believes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidestskiy] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau June 6 TASS -- Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel arrived here for an official 3-day visit today. 
  He is expected to sign with Moldavian [Moldovan] President 
Mircea Snegur a treaty on friendship and cooperation between the 
two states. The two heads of state will also discuss conditions 
for large Turkish investments in the Moldavian economy, most of 
which will be used to develop the southern regions, inhabited by 
Gagauz, an ethnic group of Turkic origin. 
  The agenda of Demirel's first day in Moldavia includes 
meetings with President Mircea Snegur and parliament speaker 
Petr Luchinskiy. The Turkish president is also expected to 
address Moldavian parliament members. On the next day, together 
with the Moldavian president, Demirel will visit the southern 
part of the republic, inhabited mainly by Gagauz. He will be 
shown several enterprises and farms there. On the last day of 
the visit Demirel will attend the opening of the Turkish embassy 
in Moldavia, which will be followed by the signing of 
Turkish-Moldavian treaty. 
  "Moldavia and Turkey have every chance to pursue a policy of 
rapprochement, to promote cooperation, and the current visit 
will turn a new page in the development of relations between the 
two countries," Demirel stated. "We back the process of 
negotiations now under way between the Gagauz population and the 
Moldovan central administration," he added. "It is intended to 
make our brothers live in their native land with due respect for 
the territorial integrity of Moldavia, to give them a legal 
status, contributing to their development. These negotiations 
are Moldavia's internal affair. The Gagauz, for their part, can 
serve as a solid bridge of friendship between our two countries." 
  "The treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two 
countries will give a fresh impetus to bilateral relations and 
will help overcome the difficulties of the transition period now 
experienced by Moldova," President Snegur stated today. 
"Problems linked with the creation of a Black Sea economic 
cooperation zone will also be discussed during the visit." 
  Snegur noted the Turkish leadership's balanced and well 
thought out policy towards separatist tendencies in some 
regions, which threaten peace. "Proceeding from the fact that 
the Moldavia top leadership is also confronted with this 
problem, we move to discuss all the possible ways for its 
effective settlement. We hope that the granting of a special 
legal status to populated localities inhabited by the Gagauz 
population will create a precedent for districts on the 
left-hand bank of the Dniester river, where the centrifugal 
tendencies are even stronger. The development of relations of 
kinship with Turkey will allow the Gagauz population to 
safeguard and pass on their extremely rich traditions and 
culture to the rising generation." 
  Much hope is pinned on the current visit by the head of the 
Kamrat (Gagauz) administration Viktor Volkov. He said that the 
Turkish side had assumed a commitment to make investments in the 
construction of telephone lines and roads, and in the 
re-equipment of the Gagauz processing industry. 
  The Turkish president is accompanied by representatives of 
Turkish legislative bodies, government, business circles, and 
public organisations.

  [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel expressed his 
satisfaction with respect to the negotiations held between 
Chisinau and Komrat (an administrative center of the 
non-recognized Gagauz republic). "We support the negotiating 
process the major aim of which is to ensure that our brothers 
live in their native land as citizens who respect the 
territorial integrity of Moldova, and have a juridical status 
which will help the Gagauz to develop," Demirel declared to the 
press service of the Moldovan president on the eve of his visit 
to Chisinau. 
  At the same time Demirel underlined that he views the 
negotiations between the Gagauz population and the central 
administration "as Moldova's internal affair" and hopes that 
"all issues related to this problem will be solved by means of a 
constructive dialogue." "We hope that the Gagauz people will 
become a firm bridge of friendship between Turkey and Moldova," 
he said. 
  Demirel expressed hope that "the ways for stabilization 
which 
appeared after the nation-wide elections in Moldova will help to 
solve the republic's economic problems." He also reported that 
he would be glad to share the Turkish experience with the 
Moldovan leaders during his scheduled meetings in Chisinau.

  [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- "Importantly, the initiative 
to stage the first ever joint exercises of Russian and American 
peace makers in the U.S comes from the U.S. legislators, not the 
executive authorities," Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State 
Duma Foreign Affairs Commitee, told the media in reply to a RIA 
query. He said that the initiative is especially topical in the 
light of the acute debates in the State Duma around the issue of 
staging the exercises in the Totskiy grounds in Russia. 
  There is ample reason to change the site, Lukin holds. 
Russia is living with a feeling of enhanced national 
self-awareness, responsibility and even "trampled national 
pride." That is why the nascent partnership with other 
countries, including the U.S., must be tactful and careful. 
  In this connection Lukin welcomed the initiative of the U.S. 
legislators who seem to appreciate the complexity of the current 
situation in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Social Democratic Party leader </F>
Aleksandr Rutskoy by Giulietto Chiesa in Moscow; date not given: 
"The Return of Yeltsin's Rival"] 
  [Text] His party's 140 delegates listen as he makes his 
proclamation: "Early presidential elections, there is no 
alternative." Aleksandr Rutskoy will be running, of course. 
His party, which was unable to fight in the December election, 
has met for its second conference. Until yesterday, it was 
called the "Free Russia People's Party," while, as of today, 
they have added the adjective: "social democratic." The 
election campaign has begun for the former Lefortovo detainee. 
He sees me in a private reception room in an imposing building 
on the Leninskiy Prospekt and asks me not to publish its 
address. The conference is not clandestine, but the owners of 
the building are shy of publicity. 
  [Chiesa] Aleksandr Vladimirovich, when you call for 
presidential elections, do you have any particular date in mind? 
  [Rutskoy] It is not up to me. The president, the Duma, and 
the Federal Council have to decide. I hope they will be 
reasonable, otherwise we may plunge headfirst into another 
tragedy. People's patience has its limits. In the days of 
serfdom, there were no wages, but at least people had something 
to eat. Now, millions of people in Russia have no wages and 
nothing to eat. What sort of national concord is that! No form 
of concord is possible in these conditions. Anyway, look how 
the president's followers, the people from "Russia's Choice," 
are behaving toward Zhirinovskiy. They have signed the pact, 
and he has signed it too, but they still go on calling him a 
fascist. Do they want concord? I hardly think so. They have 
even labeled me a communo-fascist as well. Tomorrow it will be 
somebody else's turn. They have a saying in the East: "If the 
prophet stumbles, the whole populace stumbles, too." As long as 
Yeltsin is the prophet, they will go on stumbling. And in the 
end we shall fall down and crack our skulls. This is why the 
election must be brought forward. 
  [Chiesa] Do you think that the opposition parties can 
submerge their differences and select you as their sole 
candidate? 
  [Rutskoy] The opposition must unite if it wants to win. Time 
is against those in power. I have asked my party to work on 
promoting unity among the opposition, but we must keep at it. 
Unless we unite, we shall remain patriotic leaders of the 
parlor. Striking deals with those in government is not a viable 
option, because there can be no consensus between the murderer 
and the murdered. 
  [Chiesa] You will be aware that you are regarded with 
considerable distrust in the West. How do you intend to 
convince them that you pose no threat to democracy? 
  [Rutskoy] The democrats have slung mud at me, presenting me 
as an antireformist. I have collected all my major speeches in 
a book. They should read them in the West, and they will realize 
that they have been misled by the propaganda put out by the 
Russian democrats. I am a social democrat by deeply held 
conviction, I stand for a just society where all are equal 
before the law and all have the opportunity to improve their 
status. My creed is reform and patriotism, and I think that 
international relations must be based on mutual trust. 
  [Chiesa] But not all the patriotic forces in Russia are 
democratic and reformist, as you know full well, and one of the 
gravest suspicions regarding you derives from the fact that, 
during those tragic days in October, you did not throw 
Barkashov's fascists, who were giving the stiff-arm salute and 
wearing swastikas on their arms, out of the White House. 
  [Rutskoy] And I ask you: Who has the moral right to call his 
own compatriots fascists? Public opinion abroad is being 
misinformed by having the black rag of the fascists in Russia 
waved in its face. The primary task of true Russian reformers 
now is to consolidate a large front with room for all shades of 
reform, ranging from the evolutionary to the revolutionary. 
Only then, when consolidation has been achieved, when the worst 
rents have been patched up, will we decide what to do about the 
unacceptable ideologies. 
  [Chiesa] What do you think of Chernomyrdin? And if you were 
to win, who would be your prime minister? 
  [Rutskoy] Chernomyrdin is a nothing, a nonentity. He would 
do better to see to the economy in a country that has seen a 
42-percent drop in national income in the three years of 
"reforms" in which he has been in operation. As a comparison, 
just think that national income in the USSR, which had been 
destroyed by the war against the Nazis, fell by only 17 percent. 
These reformers have done Russia three times as much harm as 
the Nazis. There are as many excellent prime ministers in 
Russia as anyone could want. An example? Sergey Glazyev, who 
left the Chernomyrdin government as a protest against the 
October coup. 
  [Chiesa] Would you change the current Constitution or go 
back 
to the old one? 
  [Rutskoy] There is no question of going back. I would like 
the Constitution to contain clear rights and clear duties for 
all the citizens, the president included. This one merely 
grants the president powers and absolute liberty with no 
oversight and no institutional accountability. 
  [Chiesa] Would you prefer a parliamentary republic? 
  [Rutskoy] I am not saying that. What I have in mind is a 
system of powers balanced by reciprocal restraints, as in the 
whole of the civilized world. The parliament has no power here. 
The government is formally accountable solely to the president, 
although it does as it pleases. The president is answerable to 
no one: He decides whatever he likes, even though no one obeys 
his decisions. Do you think this is workable? 
  [Chiesa] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy? Do you regard 
him as an opponent? Could he become an ally of yours? 
  [Rutskoy] His conduct is clearly unworthy of a true leader, 
but no one can rule out the possibility of his winning. Indeed, 
no one expected such a success in the December election. But I 
believe the fact that he has signed the concord with the 
cannoneers who have the parliament under fire, with the authors 
of the present chaos, has irrevocably sealed his fate. People 
have not forgiven Yeltsin for the dead, and they will not 
forgive Zhirinovskiy for flirting with Yeltsin. 
  [Chiesa] And what about Zyuganov's communists? Could they 
become allies of yours? 
  [Rutskoy] I think so, even though the communists behaved 
very 
ambiguously, both in the first coup, in August 1991, and in the 
one that took place in October 1993. But the fault lies with 
the leaders, not with the voters. 
  [Chiesa] In October, you were relying on the Army, but it 
did 
not come to your aid. What is the mood currently prevailing 
among the Armed Forces? 
  [Rutskoy] I was not relying on the Army, but on the people. 
I was not the one who wanted a confrontation. It was not the 
Army that was responsible for the massacre. It was corrupt 
generals, well-fed and arrogant, who dug in with the minister at 
the Ministry of Defense. The crack divisions that opened fire 
are by no means the whole Army, most of which is ill-treated, 
poor, and lacking in social guarantees. The election confirmed 
this, with 60 percent of the military vote going to 
Zhirinovskiy. Had I not been in prison, I would have obtained 
just as much. 
  [Chiesa] What do you think of Gorbachev? 
  [Rutskoy] As a politician, he is finished. Any attempt at a 
comeback as the leader of Russia is bound to fail. No one will 
believe him again. He was president of a great power, but he 
lost it. 
  [Chiesa] What would you say to Bill Clinton if you met him? 
  [Rutskoy] That current relations between our two countries 
are neither sincere nor honest. People think that the United 
States set out to weaken the USSR and Russia so that we would 
collapse, and to bring us to the disaster in which we now find 
ourselves. The United States made a mistake in its dealings 
with us, and the Western leaders who are continuing along the 
same lines are making the same mistake. Every chemical reaction 
has its effects. The United States lays claim to a hegemonic 
role in the world, but the effects of this claim will have 
repercussions on Europe, too. As far as Russia is concerned, I 
do not doubt that she will be capable of getting back on her 
feet and that, sooner or later, the peoples that made up the 
USSR will join forces once more to form a new entity. 
  [Chiesa] Will you meet Solzhenitsyn when he returns to 
Russia? 
  [Rutskoy] I have read his books, even when they were banned. 
His return is only right and natural. I think it will exert an 
influence on our society and politics. I concur with much, 
though not all, of what he says in his famous essay, "How To 
Organize Russia." He was a long way away, and I am here and see 
things better. I hope that he will support the patriotic 
movement, which is fighting to turn Russia back into a great, 
respected nation. 
  [Chiesa] Do you not think that the fact that you have 
accepted the amnesty is tantamount to acknowledging your guilt? 
  [Rutskoy] No. They were the ones who decided on the amnesty 
in exchange for the suppression of the inquiry into the October 
events. I broke neither the law nor the Constitution in force at 
the time. I did not ask for an amnesty, and I demand full 
rehabilitation. God exists, and He knows I did all I could to 
avoid people being killed. The only weight on my conscience is a 
moral one, because I failed to avoid it. 
  [Chiesa] What future do you see for Yeltsin? 
  [Rutskoy] I wish him no ill. The most sensible thing for him 
to do would be to resign and spend more time with his 
grandchildren.

  [Text] Moscow, May 25, RIA -- According to the State Duma 
committee on international affairs, Russia has not ratified at 
least 20 international treaties with foreign states, owing to 
the absence of a law on the procedure for their ratification and 
enforcement. 
  According to a committee spokesman, this makes partners ask 
questions. For example, a delegation of the Slovak parliament, 
which finished its visit to Moscow on May 24, wondered why the 
treaty of cooperation between the two countries, signed in 
August 1993, had not been ratified yet. More over, the time for 
ratifying it has not been chosen. The committee spokesman said 
that the deputies received a draft of the aforementioned law 
from the Russian president only in late April, and will discuss 
it at a session soon.

  [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- The assassination of 
Lieutenant-Colonel Vladimir Borisenkov, a senior staff member of 
Russian frontier troops in Tajikistan, has been described as 
"vile and filthy" by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin, who 
read 
out the document at a news briefing for journalists, noted that 
this was not the first act of terrorism against Russian 
servicemen. 
  "These acts are planned and executed," said the diplomat, 
"by 
those who are not interested in defusing the situation in 
Tajikistan and who want to drive a wedge in Russian-Tajik 
relations". 
  The statement points to the need for the Tajik authorities 
thoroughly to investigate the murder, and catch and punish the 
perpetrators. The Foreign Ministry expressed condolences to 
Borisenkov's relatives. 
  Russian diplomatic sources told RIA that within minutes of 
the act becoming known, Emomali Rakhmonov, the Tajik head of 
state, phoned to the Russian frontier troop headquarters and 
said all measures would be taken to catch the criminals and 
asked to convey condolences to the family of the killed man.

  [Text] Moscow, May 27, RIA -- A "moment of truth" is 
approaching in the effort to settle the Karabakh conflict, where 
all political forces and all participant states are expected to 
decide whether they want to stop bloodshed and settle the 
conflict by peaceful means, or they want to use the problems 
engendered by the conflict for their own domestic and foreign 
political ends, a RIA correspondent was told by Vladimir 
Kazimirov, the Russian president's envoy in charge of 
facilitating negotiations in order to attain political 
settlement in Nagorny Karabakh [Nagorno- Karabakh]. 
  On the current situation in the region, the Russian diplomat 
said although the May 12 ceasefire agreement - which is valuable 
- is being observed, the situation is fragile and insecure. 
Kazimirov holds that what is needed is clear striving by all 
parties to the conflict to turn the interval into a firm truce 
and to settle all outstanding issues exclusively at the 
negotiating table. 
  The diplomat said that Russia stands for an end to the armed 
conflict, is making specific proposals, an unbiased intermediary 
as she is, and is ready to back them up with specific deeds. 
"We are open for practical cooperation with the aim of settling 
the conflict with the involvement of the international 
community, in particular the CIS, the CSCE and the UN," 
Kazimirov concluded.

<F P=106> ["GV" report: "Prime Minister Aho Visits Murmansk"] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of Finnish trade and industry are 
keen to learn about the development plans of the Murmansk region 
and possibilities of direct trading. These wishes were 
presented to the leaders of the Murmansk region on Monday by 
Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party), at the beginning of a 
two-day visit to Murmansk. Prime Minister Aho arrived in 
Murmansk with an official delegation and a large trade 
delegation on Monday afternoon. He was met by Jevgeniy Komarov, 
governor of the Murmansk region. 
  Aho and Komarov held a brief discussion on Monday before 
rushing off to a seminar dealing with current and future 
cooperation projects. This seminar was attended by Finnish 
officials and business people. 
  Governor Komarov, who held the opening speech at the 
seminar, 
pointed out that Aho's visit to Murmansk was the first one made 
by a Finnish prime minister. It was, according to him, no 
coincidence that the visit came so soon after President Martti 
Ahtisaari's visit to Moscow. Aho also stressed that the 
multiple visits this year had been instrumental in developing 
relations between Finland and Russia. Aho had already visited 
St. Petersburg and Carelia. In his opinion, these visits are 
indicative of Finland's genuine interest in a cooperation with 
its neighboring regions. The visit is a response to the 
constructive criticism made earlier by Governor Komarov 
concerning the Finns' interest in the Murmansk region. This is 
why the prime minister's working visit includes a business 
delegation of 20 persons with management representatives from 
small- and medium-sized companies. According to Aho, Finnish 
companies want certain basic infrastructures in Murmansk to 
improve. He mentioned the issue of transport communications, a 
relaxation of border controls, more efficient banking and 
financing systems, and better data communications. In addition, 
Aho said that Finnish companies have two general requests. 
First, they want more information about the development plans 
of the Murmansk region and the possibility for enterprises to 
use foreign currency in trading. Second, they need information 
about direct foreign trade opportunities. Aho stated that the 
Finns are potentially interested in the utilization of the 
Murmansk region's natural resources. After the seminar, Aho and 
a small part of his delegation set off on a fishing trip on the 
Ponoj river in the East of the Kola Peninsula. 
<H5>  Investment Guarantees </H5>
  Martin Saarikangas, CEO of Kvaerner Masa-Yards and head of 
the commercial delegation, also wanted guarantees for foreign 
investments. Such guarantees could take the form, for instance, 
of natural resources or land areas. According to Governor 
Komarov, a regulation with regard to the protection of invested 
capital in the Murmansk region is being prepared. Finnish 
business leaders at the seminar were pariticularly interested in 
the natural resources of the continental shelf, more 
particularly, the presence of natural gas in Sjtokmanovskoje [as 
received]. Neste CEO Kai Hietarinta pointed out that the issue 
was not only oil or gas, but also transportation, ship repairs, 
and terminals. Hietarinta said that the Finns are cooperating 
with the autonomous region of Nenetsia [as received] and 
expressed his hope for an increased cooperation between Nenetsia 
and the Murmansk region. 
<H5>  Neste Ships Under Russian Flag </H5>
  Neste also has shipping plans in the Arctic area. On Monday, 
the board of Neste decided to charter one of the company's ships 
to a joint venture enterprise in Murmansk to sail under Russian 
flag. A law is being prepared in Russia which will give Russian 
ships the sole right to Arctic transports, and Neste's strategy 
therefore is to put its ships under Russian flag.

  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (MTI) -- The protocol on returning 
to, and storing in, Russia the used fuel cartridges of the Paks 
nuclear power plant violates a Russian law on environmental 
protection, President Boris Yeltsin's adviser on environmental 
affairs said. 
  The protocol was signed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's visit to Budapest early April. 
  The adviser, Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the environmental 
interdepartmental committee of the Russian National Security 
Council, pressed for immediate talks with Hungary on the matter. 
  Meeting Hungarian journalists, Yablokov said that Clause 34 
in Paragraph 50 of Russia's law on environmental protection, 
approved two years ago, bars the delivery of any radioactive 
waste to Russia for the purpose of storage or recycling. 
  The law applies to Hungary but does not affect some other 
countries, for instance Finland or Bulgaria, which built 
Soviet-type nuclear power plants and agreed on returning the 
radioactive waste before the Russian law took effect. 
  "This is a rather complex problem. Radioactive pollution 
poses a particularly grave challenge in Russia. It became clear 
after decades of secrecy how polluted our country is. Unlawful 
importation of radiocative waste is a headache," Yablokov said. 
  On the protocol, the adviser saw two options. The related 
clause of the law could be amended -- a possible but lengthy 
procedure. Or Russia would accept the recycled waste, sealed in 
glass, being returned to Hungary. If Hungary were prepared to 
take the waste back this way, the protocol could be amended 
accordingly, he said. 
  Commenting on Chernomyrdin's latest remark that the protocol 
is not subject to approval by the Duma, Yablokov said the prime 
minsiter can ignore the Duma but it remains to be seen how long 
he can do so. "The prime minister will hardly openly confront 
the Duma because of nuclear waste," he said.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent A. Peslyak; from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Sergey] Yushenkov, [chairman of State Duma 
Committee for Defense], said that comparison of the systems of 
civilian control over the armed forces in the two countries 
[United States and Russia] shows that our system is not 
developed. 
  Russian Foreign Minister [Andrey Kozyrev] said that it is 
not 
democratic to lay down the condition that Russia should 
unilaterally accept the obligation to end arms supplies to 
certain regions in the country before talks can start. We are 
for stability without conditions being laid down for one side. 
The Karabakh conflict, which has destabilized the situation in 
the Caucasus, creates problems for us on our southern border, 
yet some people abroad see us as neo-imperialists here, rather 
than as peacekeepers, and even regard Russia's efforts as being 
opposed to those of the CSCE.

  [Text] Moscow has no intention of giving up weapons exports 
to third world countries unilaterally without prior talks with 
the West, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in Moscow 
on Tuesday. At a meeting with U.S. congressmen led by Senator 
Sam Nunn, he dwelt upon Russian arms exports to Iran which are 
causing western concern. 
  "Let us work together over the rules of weapons exports (to 
third countries)", Kozyrev said. "Asking Russia to undertake 
commitment not to export weapons(to Iran) unilaterally as a 
condition for talks on the issue is not only out of line with 
the spirit of partnership with our western allies, but it also 
brings to mind the worst in our common history", he said. 
  About Nagorno-Karabakh, the minister said that Russia was 
alone prepared to send peacekeepers to that area of conflict 
poisoning the situation on both sides of the Caucasus and posing 
threat to its southern fringes. 
  "Meanwhile, we are being accused of neo-imperialism on the 
grounds that a political solution must be found to the conflict 
before sending peacekeepers to the region", he said. 
  Kozyrev said that instead of the assistance Moscow would 
welcome, the West preferred to act as inspector driving in a 
wedge in efforts by Russia and the CSCE to try to settle the 
conflict. "This is not a partnership approach", he said. 
  For details, refer to Diplomatic Panorama of May 31.

  [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas today received 
European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and an accompanying 
delegation. 
  Brazauskas welcomed the guest who is representing an 
international organization, which is little known in Lithuania, 
but which is important to its future. Striving for integration 
in the European community, Brazauskas said, I have taken 
measures to coordinate the steps of Lithuania and of other 
Eastern and Central European states and proposed to arrange a 
meeting of the leaders of the Baltic states and the states of 
the Visegrad group. I have taken some steps lately to realize 
the ideas of this cooperation. 
  The president dwelled on the complex development of 
relations 
between Lithuania and Russia, especially with Kaliningrad 
region. He expressed concern over obstacles in the processes of 
independence of Ukraine and Belarus. It is imperative to seek a 
solution in relations between Russia and Estonia, with a view to 
foreign troops being withdrawn from this Baltic state, too, by 
the end of the summer. 
  Describing Lithuania's domestic scene, Brazauskas said that 
political passions have somewhat subsided in the one and a half 
years which have elapsed since the elections to the Seimas. The 
economic situation is difficult, however. Lithuania especially 
lacks foreign investments. Western countries should pay more 
attention to the Eastern and Central European states and help to 
consolidate their stability. 
  Klepsch supported the idea of cooperation between the Baltic 
and Visegrad states. The European community, he said, is 
concerned about the stability of the Northern and Central 
European states, especially of those with whom it is preparing 
to conclude agreements of associated membership. 
  Welcoming the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, the guest drew 
attention to the importance of normalizing relations with 
Russia. The guest also gave a positive assessment to the fact 
that there are no problems of national minorities in Lithuania, 
that the process of their integration is taking place. This is 
well known in the European parliament, he said. 
  The meeting lasted for one hour instead of the planned 40 
minutes. "We had to explain our attitude to current Russian 
policy, relations of that country with Ukraine and Belarus, ELTA 
correspondent was told by President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Seimas, Ceslovas 
Jursenas, today. During the meeting, the guest expressed the 
view that positive processes in Lithuania are taking the country 
closer to the European structures. "The first meetings with 
members of the Seimas factions created an impression that 
various political forces in Lithuania have similar foreign 
polity aims, and they differ only in detail. A state wishing to 
join the European Union is facing corresponding demands. After 
the signing of a free trade agreement with the European Union 
Lithuania will come closer to this European structure. 
  Klepsch supports long-term and close cooperation between the 
Lithuanian and European parliaments. 
  Ceslovas Jursenas noted that his meetings with Klepsch in 
Paris and Brussels and the present visit by the president of the 
European Parliament show that such contacts are very useful to 
our state advancing along a complex path to the European Union. 
  Accompanied by the Seimas chairman, the guest inspected the 
building of the Lithuanian parliament, a fragment of the 
barricades, and crossed himself at the Smutkelis crucifix. 
  Today, Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Lithuanian 
Bishops Conference, Vilnius archbishop Metropolitan Audrius 
Juozas Backis.

  [Excerpts] The attitude of the ruling party to the 
referendums organized on the initiative of the opposition groups 
was expressed once again at a press conference in the Seimas 
today. 
  Seimas Chancellor Neris Germanas, Vladas Butenas, member of 
the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, and faction elder 
Justinas Karosas spoke at the press conference. 
  The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party members did not deny 
the constitutional right to hold referendums but proposed an 
assessment of the need for them and their cost. In their 
opinion, the referendums proposed by the opposition on early 
Seimas elections and savings compensation cannot result in 
anything positive and will only create confusion in the state. 
[passage omitted] 
  Justinas Karosas stressed that the 4 million litas cost of 
one referendum is a large sum for the budget of a poor country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Vladas Butenas rejected accusations by the opposition about 
the government crisis. He stated that neither the president, 
nor the Seimas, nor the government can be accused of inactivity. 
They are all carrying out constitutional reforms. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, 31 May, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its 
meeting Tuesday [31 May] ruled to postpone its formal decision 
on setting up the Estonian company under the joint Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion plan and refer the draft decision for 
further review to the Defense Ministry. 
  Under the joint Baltic plan, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
would each set up a company as part of the Baltic battalion to 
be formed for participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
  All three countries also count on Western support for the 
project. "International assistance programs are expected to be 
launched as soon as we have a legal basis for the formation of 
the peacekeeping company," Enn Tupp, the head of the defense 
policy department in the Estonian Defense Ministry said in an 
interview earlier. 
  He said the three countries hope to staff the battalion by 
August.

  [Text] Tallinn, 31 May, BNS -- A report by the Estonian 
Finance Ministry, read by Minister Heiki Kranich at Tuesday's 
meeting of the Cabinet, shows that recovery in the country's 
economy continues also in the second quarter, Prime Minister 
Mart Laar said. 
  "While rising inflation was the main problem in the first 
quarter, the upward pace of inflation now has started to slow 
down and the government forecasts a continuing decrease in 
inflation rates for the second quarter," the premier said while 
briefing reporters after the cabinet meeting. 
  The Finance Ministry report, titled "On the General 
Condition 
of the Estonian Economy," points out indicators such as growing 
exports, increase in the collateral of the national currency, 
declining interest rates for short-term loans, as well as the 
improving investment climate as reflecting an ongoing economic 
recovery. 
  Also official unemployment figures have remained at low 
levels in Estonia. Both the value and physical volumes of the 
retail sector have been on the increase. 
  But the report also shows that the country's foreign trade 
deficit in the first quarter was bigger than for the whole last 
year. Despite a steady growth in exports both in February and 
in March, faster-growing imports have outrun export growth. A 
considerable deficit in the foreign trade balance is likely to 
lead to a negative outcome of the current account of the first 
quarter's balance of payments, the report warns. 
  For the first monthly period since the monetary reform of 
June 1992, a decline was recorded in March in the value of the 
collateral of the Estonian national currency, the kroon. 
  As much as 1.526 billion kroons, or 26.3 percent of the 
total 
set down for the whole year was received in budgetary earnings 
in Estonia in the first quarter. The value-added tax accounted 
for 822 million kroons of the total earnings in the first 
quarter. Also noted in the report was certain improvement as to 
the companies' debts to the state budget. 
  The World Bank in its evaluations has placed Estonia in the 
rank of upper-medium income level developing countries.

  [Text] A Georgian State Security Service special-purpose, 
assault-landing brigade has been reviewed in the village of 
Mukhrovani in East Georgia. Talking to journalists, Igor 
Giorgadze, chairman of Georgia's State Security Service, said 
that this subunit has been trained at the Russian special 
services' training centers. The Russian Armed Forces have 
provided the new Georgian special-purpose forces with new modern 
arms and equipment free of charge. The assault-landing brigade 
comprises tanks, armored hardware, artillery, a crack "Alfa" 
subunit, and an antiterrorist squad. The latter has been 
trained, armed, and equipped by the U.S. CIA. 
  Newspapers in Tbilisi reported that the upkeep of the 
Georgian special forces will cost the Republic 5 billion Russian 
rubles a year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Kakubava, leader of the Organization </F>
for the Liberation of Abkhazia, by Maia Toradze; place and date 
not given: "Shevardnadze and His Terrorist Group Should Be Wary 
of Me"] 
  [Text] [Toradze] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] 
Boris, why was the Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia 
formed? 
  [Kakubava] There used to exist in Abkhazia the Council for 
National Unity that had been elected on 9 May 1992 at the 
congress of the Georgian population living in Abkhazia. As we 
had been thrown off the territory of Abkhazia and were 
confronted with another stage in life, we considered it 
necessary to transform this purely political association -- the 
Abkhazian Council for National Unity that united 19 parties and 
organizations -- into a political and military organization that 
would lead [the struggle] for the return of the territory of 
Abkhazia. 
  [Toradze] Your organization believes that we should use 
military force to recover Abkhazia. How realistic is this? 
  [Kakubava] It is possible to recover Abkhazia only by using 
military force and only now for, if we delay, it will be too 
late. I also believe we are already eight months late and this 
is the fault of the head of state. We should not have started 
the war in Abkhazia at that precise time. We told Eduard 
Shevardnadze this right from the start. A group of 10 of us -- 
five members of the Abkhazian Council for National Unity and 
five from the Ilia Chavchavadze Society -- went to see the head 
of the Supreme Council then and we proved to him in detail that 
introducing tanks and soldiers into Abkhazia would have the 
consequences that we can clearly see now. Shevardnadze promised 
us then that he would not send armed units onto the territory of 
Abkhazia, but, one week later, the Georgian Army entered 
Abkhazia and the war began. In spite of our negative attitude, 
given that this, nevertheless, had happened, the war should have 
ended in our victory; we should have punished the separatists 
and their leaders and the enemies of Georgia and established 
Georgian jurisdiction over the territory of Abkhazia. This 
process should have lasted no more than 10 days. However, 
everyone knows that, precisely on Shevardnadze's direct 
instructions, Jaba Ioseliani [leader of the "Mkhedrioni" 
paramilitary group, first deputy chairman of the State Council 
at the time] arrived in Abkhazia, the Georgian Army halted its 
advance, and talks were held with the Abkhazians --as a result 
of which we were unable to cross the Gumista river. This led to 
the surrender of Gagra and later Sukhumi, the extermination of 
30,000 people and the expulsion of the Georgian population. 
Today, there are no Georgians in Abkhazia. It is no longer 
Georgia. 
  Yet, the greatest misfortune is that this war was called an 
Abkhazian-Georgian war, which is in no way true. This was 
Russian aggression against Georgia. The introduction of troops 
was planned by Russia. Whether it was Shevardnadze or [former 
Defense Minister] Kitovani who carried this out does not 
interest me. I know one thing: The Army was brought in on 
Russia's orders, it was made to halt its advance and play war, 
and Russia was given the opportunity to use the Apsua 
[Abkhazians' name for themselves] against us and this war was 
called an Abkhazian-Georgian war, whereas, in reality, it was 
Russian aggression. Many of those who fought in this war say 
that Gagra, Sukhumi, and Kochara were sold out. I do not know 
if this is true and do not support these kind of statements; 
however, I do know that we did not lose a single place in 
battle. Even in the position that we were then, we could have 
won any war in spite of the fact that Russian Army formations 
were opposing us; we could have won as the battle was being 
conducted on our territory. However, the Georgian authorities 
began to deceive the Georgian population by saying that we could 
not manage without Russia and that, for goodness' sake, we 
should not offend Russia and we should not say that it was 
precisely Russia that was waging war against us. In Parliament, 
we were attacked by a part of the deaf- and-dumb majority 
obedient to the authorities and were not even given the right to 
mention Abkhazia during the parliamentary sessions. I view this 
as betrayal. One cannot keep a country in a state of war for 
two years and finally state: I [Shevardnadze] did not allow our 
Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli because Abkhazians would 
have been killed there. Then, why did you go to war? Why are 
you the commander in chief of the Army who put us in a state of 
war? If you do not destroy the enemy but allow your Army to be 
destroyed in the meantime, what kind of person are you? Thirty 
thousand Georgians have died, Georgia has lost its best land, 
and no one is assuming responsibility for this. It would have 
been a different matter had you said that we had fought but lost 
the battle. However, when all actions are directed toward your 
army units losing the war -- you appoint people from the street 
to top positions, people who are absolutely incompetent, all 
levels are controlled by mafia structures, and a representative 
of the [criminal] underworld is raised to the level of the state 
-- if this is not betrayal, let any Georgian tell me what it is. 
  The head of state's statements that we will return with 
dignity to Abkhazia are nothing but deception; this is a fact 
because he conducted negotiations with the opposing side against 
our wishes. Today, Abkhazia is known throughout the world as an 
independent land. Shevardnadze could have held negotiations 
with the head of the Russian state as a war was going on between 
Georgia and Russia, whereas we could have discussed the conflict 
with the Abkhazians and come to an agreement among ourselves. 
Shevardnadze had not sent even one of our representatives to 
participate in the meetings and negotiations that had been held 
up to that point. In spite of our daily protests in Parliament 
that this was a step toward recognizing the independent state of 
Abkhazia, the independent state of Abkhazia was established in 
the accord of 4 April. When we mention this, representatives of 
the majority raise an admonishing finger and say that, on the 
contrary, we have done a good thing and that this is a political 
statement and does not mean Abkhazia's independence. There 
followed a flood [of documents] on the state independence of 
Abkhazia that were based on the 4 April accord, in particular 
the agreement of 14 May according to which Russia was able to 
declare Abkhazia to be an independent state and to determine the 
Abkhazian-Georgian border along which Russian Army units are to 
be deployed. It followed from the final agreement that Russia 
was not satisfied with Abkhazia: Samegrelo has been declared a 
buffer zone and Russian troops will be located on its territory 
as far as Khobi. 
  [Toradze] Why do you think people are negatively disposed 
toward you? Is it simply because they favor Shevardnadze or is 
it because they really do believe that it is possible to settle 
this problem by means of negotiations? 
  [Kakubava] No, this is not what they think. I do not know 
of any person in Georgia today who could sign a document giving 
away Georgian territories. I do not agree with the view that 
Georgia cannot exist on its own. We are a country of 5 million, 
but we have the potential to maintain a state of 15 million. 
However, if we artificially create such conditions in which we 
kill the Georgian's desire for originality and, if we allow the 
view to prevail that we can do nothing without others and that 
the whole world is feeding us thanks to Shevardnadze, we will be 
unable to become an advanced nation. The view has been 
frequently expressed recently that we are not a warlike people 
and that war is not our business. Such statements should be 
condemned. We are indeed a warlike people and courageous as 
well and no stronger nation than ours exists in the world; we 
are truly a decent people, but we simply need a leader who will 
conduct a policy that befits an independent state. Today, we 
have a government that is dragging us toward enslavement. It 
contains people who, in their time, were nothing but thieves and 
who do not know what a nation is and what the state approach to 
a matter is. 
  We now state the following: As they have brought us this 
far, they should now give us the chance to return to Abkhazia. 
I am not competing for anyone's job; I am a soldier. Of those 
300,000 Georgians [refugees], there are at least 50,000 brave 
men who are able to fight. Shevardnadze can see our potential. 
The Organization for the Liberation of Abkhazia can do this and 
this is why he, in principle, does not want to meet us. 
  [Toradze] If you are able to fight, why didn't you fight 
then in Abkhazia? You had the opportunity. Isn't it now rather 
late for your self-sacrifice? 
  [Kakubava] We stated at the time that we should have been 
given weapons and we could have defended our land by ourselves. 
We warned them: Don't send those inexperienced kids who are 
seeing weapons for the first time; give us the chance to fight 
alone. However, it is not only in Abkhazia, but also here that 
Shevardnadze is failing to help us in our concern to regain our 
own territory. 
  [Toradze] You mentioned that we were fighting against Russia 
in Abkhazia. However, even with an army of 50,000 that is well 
trained, is there any chance that we can win? Have you taken 
this into account? 
  [Kakubava] We can win on Georgian territory; this should not 
evoke any negative emotions in us. If Russia were to wage war 
with all its potential, it would conquer not only Georgia but 
also the whole world. However, it will not unleash such a war. 
We would always win the type of war that is being waged in 
Abkhazia. 
  [Toradze] Today, you held a news conference at which you 
said that you were filing a law suit against Shevardnadze in the 
Georgian Supreme Court.... 
  [Kakubava] Yes. I said that, if, on the instructions of 
Shevardnadze, Parliament does not disavow all those signed 
documents concerning Abkhazia within the next five days, we 
reserve the right to call upon the Georgian population to 
restore the territorial integrity of Georgia and will demand 
that the government be replaced by peaceful means, without any 
bloodshed or destruction. However, we do not want Shevardnadze 
to leave Georgia without assuming responsibility. Therefore, we 
have filed a lawsuit in the Georgian Supreme Court and with the 
procurator general in which we accuse him of betraying Georgia 
in accordance with Article 65 of the Georgian Criminal Code. 
  [Toradze] Do you think that you will win this case? 
  [Kakubava] The case is already won, as, to our surprise, he 
stated at a parliamentary session that the reason for his not 
permitting the Army to enter Gudauta and Tqvarcheli was that 
this would have resulted in the annihilation of the Abkhazian 
people. This crowns everything that he has done up to now. When 
the commander in chief does not allow his own army to destroy 
the opposing side and, meanwhile, it is his army that is 
destroyed, this is betrayal. 
  [Toradze] Are you not afraid of making so many bold 
statements or even of filing a lawsuit? 
  [Kakubava] Shevardnadze and his terrorist group should be 
wary of me because I will be a proper plaintiff at this trial. 
If I am killed, those left behind will behave in a different 
way. 
  Furthermore, I will tell you another thing. Whoever intends 
to kill me will not be buried in Georgia as it will be 
impossible to find a burial place for him here.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 31 May 31 (SNARK) -- "There prepared 33 
agreements in previous seven rounds of the Russian-Georgian 
negotiations," said to the journalists at his today's press 
conference the Georgian Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandr 
Chikvaidze. 
  "Practically, we created the legislative basis for 
development of the relations between two states." 
  Aleksandr Chikvaidze denied the reports, some mass media 
spread, on the fact that there, at the negotiations, were 
determined the terms of the Russian troops' existence on the 
territory of Georgia -- 50 years. Aleksandr Chikvaidze said, 
"no terms were discussed at the negotiations." 
  Speaking on the Russian military bases creation on the 
territory of Georgia, Mr. Chikvaidze said, "If only Georgia 
offers her territory for Russian military bases, she should get 
something in exchange. This question couldn't be solved without 
referendum, without Parliament's content. Yet some more rounds 
of negotiations are being expected." The eighth round of 
negotiations is expected by the end of June.

  [Text] We are presenting information supplied by CS agency 
[as heard]. 
  A CS information agency correspondent has been told by 
Deputy 
Security Minister Avtandil Ioseliani that a report broadcast in 
an Alioni TV program alleging that quadripartite talks in Sochi 
have failed does not correspond to the facts. 
  A meeting of the quadripartite commission on Abkhazia took 
place in Sochi on 29 and 30 May. The meeting had to create a 
foundation for the return of forcefully displaced people to 
Abkhazia. During the meeting, the Abkhaz side demanded that a 
paragraph be included in an application form according to which 
Georgian refugees would promise to abide by Abkhazian laws. The 
Georgian and Russian parties at the meeting unequivocally 
rejected the demand because it was absurd to have a formulation 
like this before an Abkhazian status had been established. 
  The meeting discussed an issue of registering refugees and 
possibilities of information exchange in this connection. A 
joint statement has been adopted. 
  According to Mr. Avtandil Ioseliani, the next meeting of the 
quadripartite commission is to be held in Sochi on 20-21 June.

  [Text] Tbilisi 31 May -- It has become known to IBERIA NEWS 
AGENCY that the Helsinki Union of Georgia [political 
organization created by late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia] has 
addressed a statement to ethnic Georgians exiled from the 
Abkhazian and Samachablo regions. The statement says: 
  "Regarded from the current historic point, it can be 
confidently said that devastating developments in the Abkhazian 
region in 1992-93 have been the largest tragedy for 200 years of 
Georgia's slavery under the Russian yoke of oppression. Every 
one of us can clearly understand that the effect of the tragedy 
is disastrous for the Georgian state and the Georgian nation. 
  We have to make a final inference: Who is our real enemy, 
who is hiding beyond Abkhaz and Ossetian militants armed with 
the newest military equipment and who is actually governing 
Georgia's policy? 
  There is only one answer: The Russian empire, which managed 
to occupy and annex not only Abkhazia and Samachablo, but the 
whole Georgia as well, and which, by means of puppet regimes in 
Tbilisi, Tskhinvali, and Gudauta-Sukhumi, carries out the 
genocide of Georgians, tears a united body of the Georgian state 
and encroaches upon the state independence achieved by peaceful 
means. Every agreement concluded with the alleged mediation of 
Russia has served this aim and created a foundation for the 
estrangement of the Samachablo and Abkhazian regions. 
  It may be assumed that a list of anti-Georgian wrecking 
activities of the puppet regime has not been exhausted. The 
policy presently conducted in Samegrelo [Russian: Mingreliya] 
creates grounds for bloody provocation at the Enguri river and 
augurs the continuation of the genocide of Georgians and 
disastrous effect for the whole Georgia."

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgiy Kvesitadze, minister of agriculture </F>
and the processing industry, by SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent 
Ketevan Amiredzhibi; place and date not given: "Land and 
Reforms"] 
  [Text] In the current most acute food crisis, many are 
ready to blame the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
the Processing Industry. However, let us look at the issue in a 
different way: Does the Ministry possess the rights and powers 
enabling it to have a real influence upon the processes taking 
place in the branch. 
  In this regard, Georgiy Kvesitadze, minister of the 
agriculture and processing industry, and member of the 
republic's Academy of Sciences, answered questions put to him by 
a SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA correspondent. 
  [Amiredzhibi] Many people are interested to know: Is a 
structural reorganization of the management of the branch 
underway? 
  [Kvesitadze] Yes. However, it is proceeding slowly. 
Administrative mechanisms are not functioning in the current 
situation as, to all intents and purposes, there is no market 
economy in the country. Nevertheless, work is proceeding on the 
creation and improvement of the structure of management of the 
branch in new economic conditions; first and foremost, within 
the framework of the European Union [EU] project. This concerns 
the elaboration of an organizational structure for managing the 
branch and mechanisms for serving agricultural enterprises, 
so-called agro-service. Priorities have already been determined 
for developing subbranches of the country's agro-industrial 
complex. Incidentally, a strategy for the production of 
agricultural products in the Republic is being elaborated 
together with a group of EU experts and the Ministry and the 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences. 
  [Amiredzhibi] Can one speak about any proper cadres policy 
in the branch today? 
  [Kvesitadze] Of course. Work is proceeding according to a 
specially elaborated program. The heads of agro-industrial 
departments and the managers of more than 50 enterprises and 
organizations, and so forth have been replaced in more than 20 
rayons. In order to train, retrain, and improve the 
qualifications of cadres in the agro-industrial complex, there 
exists within the Ministry the Higher School for the Management 
of the Agro-Industrial Complex and the Institute for Improving 
the Qualifications of Cadres in the Food Industry, 16 
specialized technical schools, 14 inter-rayon training centers, 
and seven permanent training courses with a fairly strong 
material and technical training base. New forms of training are 
being introduced. The first stage involves the training of 
qualified workers; the second -- the training of mid-level 
specialists who will receive a bachelor's degree. A third stage 
is also being planned, which will involve the training of 
higher-level specialists who will be awarded a master's degree. 
With this aim, the majority of specialized technical schools 
within our system have been reorganized into agricultural 
colleges offering various specializations. Instruction in many 
new specializations has started. 
  Life convinces us that the branch badly needs new types of 
cadres, particularly in such spheres as the organization and 
management of the economy, modernization and automation, the 
market economy, the mastering of new conditions for science, and 
so forth. In this respect, a system for improving the 
qualifications of production managers and other specialists is 
being established. 
  [Amiredzhibi] What is the situation regarding privatization 
and joint-stock companies in the branch? 
  [Kvesitadze] At the moment, these processes are progressing 
slowly. Given the sharp reduction in land set aside for 
agricultural enterprises, there are very many premises, 
vehicles, agricultural equipment, and other assets that are not 
being used and standing idle. These are the ones that need to 
be privatized first so that agricultural production can get 
underway, but this should now be in the hands of peasant 
holdings, farms, and other private entrepreneurs. One has to 
say that the process has become quite complicated regarding the 
privatization of buildings and installations not being used on 
state farms, for example, livestock departments and other 
facilities. The whole point is that they can be privatized only 
by a decree issued by the Cabinet of Ministers. There are 
thousands of such facilities. I believe that it is wholly 
sufficient to obtain permission from our ministry whereas rayon 
bodies dealing with the management of state property can attend 
to the proper course of the privatization process. 
  Let me say a few words about the privatization of 
agricultural machinery. We believe that there should be some 
delay before tackling this issue. We propose the following 
solution: It is expedient to form, on the basis of agricultural 
equipment that has been made available following the 
reorganization of state and collective farms, subdivisions of 
the agro-service that will also serve the small farms and other 
holdings that are being created. Of course, this does not 
exclude another solution: Individual farms will be given the 
opportunity to acquire machinery as private property. 
  It is possible for a state farm to be privatized and taken 
over by its collective as a whole. This is already happening, 
for example, in Dushetskiy rayon. 
  There is a different approach to the privatization of 
enterprises in the food and processing industry. Here, it is 
expedient to form joint-stock companies. For example, the 
"Tbilmargarinprom" production association, the commercial and 
industrial firm "Kristall," and enterprises in Tbilisi -- the 
"Kartli" tobacco factory and a dairy -- have already been turned 
into joint-stock companies. A list of enterprises has been 
drawn up, 51 percent of whose shares will belong to the state 
once they become joint-stock companies. Preparatory work has 
already been completed at many enterprises due to be transformed 
into joint-stock companies. 
  However, there are enterprises whose production is of 
strategic importance for the Republic, namely alcoholic drinks, 
tea, and tobacco. The issue here is clear cut: It is necessary 
for the state to have a temporary monopoly on this production; 
this means that the privatization of these type of enterprises, 
as yet, does not correspond to the general interests of the 
state. 
  One more thing has to be said. Privatization in this branch 
is, in many respects, of a spontaneous nature. Facilities are 
being redeemed on the basis of leasing agreements that were 
concluded previously, that is to say, assets are not being 
revalued taking into account inflation and enterprises are being 
bought for a song. Such facts have come to light through the 
work of the Commission for the Privatization of State Property 
that has been created in the ministry. State property should be 
redeemed without fail according to its value at the moment of 
the transaction. 
  [Amiredzhibi] Are there any violations and abuses on the 
part of local authorities in the privatization process? 
  [Kvesitadze] There are very many, particularly when it is a 
matter of the privatization of land. Thus, as a result of 
incompetent and unscrupulous work by local land-privatization 
commissions, there are facts of land being taken that has not 
been included in the land reform program. As a result, several 
seed farms have ceased to exist. In a number of 
livestock-breeding complexes, not even the minimum amount of 
land has remained for the production of feed. We are somehow 
trying to correct the mistakes made. In this regard, on the 
initiative of the Ministry, the Republic's government adopted a 
decree in 1992 in accordance with which it is prohibited to 
include in the land reform program that land on which scientific 
and educational institutions, experimental centers, nurseries, 
pedigree stock farms, and also livestock-breeding complexes and 
hothouses are located. 
  [Amiredzhibi] It is well known that the agrarian sector is 
receiving greater attention from the criminal world, if only on 
account of the fact that goods are nevertheless being produced 
there. Are any attempts being made by the Ministry -- of 
course, with the help of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
other corresponding ministries and departments -- to weaken the 
pressure being applied by criminal groups and with what effect? 
  [Kvesitadze] Mismanagement, misappropriation, the unlawful 
use of state property, unproductive expenditures, and so forth 
-- all these phenomena have always been an integral part, so to 
say, of the socialist method of economic management and have 
done enormous damage to the state and society. In the current 
conditions of economic decline, the intensification of crime, 
legal nihilism, the incompetent actions of local authorities, 
and the extremely slow pace of the formation of new economic 
relations, all these phenomena have acquired a truly universal 
character. Numerous economic and financial violations and 
criminal actions have been exposed during the second half of 
1993 by our departmental control alone. A halt has been put to 
many of these. The illegal expenditure and facts of 
embezzlement and misappropriation that have been exposed amount 
in total to over 730 million rubles. In the course of checks 
carried out, more than 120 million rubles have been recovered. 
Thirteen cases have been lodged with bodies in the Procurator's 
Office. An analysis of these statistics confirms once more the 
disorder in the economic mechanism in rural areas and the 
irresponsibility of many workers. If, in previous years, 
violators used methods of direct embezzlement and illegal 
expenditure in their encroachments upon state property, these 
have been supplemented recently by violations of existing 
leasing rules. Taking advantage of the lack of a firm 
legislative base, in particular, regarding questions of 
privatization, many have misappropriated state property for next 
to nothing. Gross violations of leasing rules in cases of 
redemption and incorrect settlements have deprived the state 
budget of approximately 600 million rubles. 
  Countering this anarchy is difficult, but not impossible. We 
are strengthening departmental control and establishing close 
contacts with the Chamber of Control and the republic's law 
enforcement bodies for we realize that, only by uniting our 
efforts, will it be possible to bring about some kind of changes 
to the situation that has taken shape.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("YERKIR" daily), 06/01/94 -- RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] Acting Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Arkadiy Gukasyan sent a message to the Chairman of the 
CSCE Minsk group Ian Eliasson on 31 May. 
  "Dear Mr. Eliasson: 
  ``I shall give you some details about the actions of the 
Azeri armed units in the captured RMK territories. 
  ``At the beginning of May 1994 the Karabakh army liberated 
the villages of Talish, Seisulan, Yarmja and Karmiravan in the 
Martakertskiy district of the Republic from the occupants. 
  ``Having to retreat, the Azeri command ordered to destroy 
the 
Armenian villages. The intercepted radio communications 
evidence that this barbarous actions have been coordinated with 
the Azeri high ranking political leadership. 
  ``The abovementioned villages, as well as other villages in 
the RMK Martakertskiy, Gadrutskiy, Askeranskiy, Martuninskiy and 
Shushinskiy districts, which have formerly been occupied by the 
Azeri forces, are in fact razed to the ground. The retreating 
Azeri army is only leaving ashes behind, thus forcing [the RMK 
to take] [previous brackets are source-supplied] retaliative 
measures. 
  ``We have irrefutable information about inhabiting native 
Armenian lands by the Azeris. This has also been carried in 
Azerbaijan on the level of state policy. The authorities in 
this country are actively working on inhabiting the villages of 
Leninavan, Maraga in the Martakertskiy district, Shahumyanov, 
Kharkhaputi, Verishen, Hay-Boris, Rus-Boris, Buzlukh, Gulistan, 
Garachinar, Hakhtut, Manashid, Nor-Shen and Yerkej in the 
Shaumyanovskiy district [by Azeris] [previous brackets are 
source-supplied]. 
  ``The same fortune would have expected hundreds of other 
native Armenian villages, if not the courage of RMK defense army 
fighters who liberated the Armenian villages. To be more 
precise, not the villages but the ashes which remained after the 
retreat of the Azeri units. 
  ``I would be very grateful if you can send your 
representative to the region for investigation of this problem 
on the spot. 
  ``In all cases, we hope for immediate and effective measures 
you will carry for preventing the possible negative consequences 
of the political stance of the Azeri leaders and for the 
peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict.''

  [Text] Tallinn, May 31, BNS -- Nordic countries, the 
United States and Canada are to give the Baltics and Belarus 1.5 
million dollars to support their efforts in resolving the issue 
of refugees and prevention of illegal immigration, said Juri 
Ruus, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Interior Ministry. 
  Ruus was quoting the head of the Nordic mission of the 
International Migration Organization, Oystein Optal, who had 
announced the assistance package at a meeting on refugee issues 
at the Estonian Interior Ministry today. 
  The 1.5 million dollar program includes assistance to 
Russian-speakers in the Baltics who want to re-emigrate to 
Russia, but also for those who want to move to Latin America or 
other regions, Ruus explained. The first 0.5-million tranche of 
the aid line is to be made available for the Baltics and Belarus 
from July 1, Ruus said. 
  The U.N. Refugee Commission's new representative to the 
Nordic region and the Baltics, Hans Thoolen, is expected to 
arrive in Estonia for an acquaintance mission on June 20. 
  Ruus said his department's data shows there are currently 
about 180 illegal immigrants in Estonia.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Anti-crime measures, the major 
aspects of President Boris Yeltsin's policy line, taxation 
policy, relief to victims of conflicts, NATO-Russia 
relationships, lack of housing for servicemen, and Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn's stay in the Far East are major topics in today's 
Moscow-based newspapers. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries a regular survey by the glasnost 
protection foundation under the headline "The Persecution of 
Journalists and the Press in Ex-USSR: May 1994". 
  Three journalists were killed in May, another three were 
beaten up, and 19 were subjected to persecution on the part of 
the state, according to the survey which was compiled by expert 
Oleg Panfilov on the strength of reports by periodicals, human 
rights organisations, and journalists during last month. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA runs an interview with Russian Minister 
of 
Justice Yuriy Kalmykov, who expressed the conviction that the 
main task in combating crime is in securing the inevitability of 
punishment for offenders, not in toughening penalties. Almost a 
half of all registered crimes last year remained unexposed (and, 
it means, went unpunished). About 1.5 million criminals were 
thus not arraigned for trial, he said. 
  Touching upon possible miscarriages of justice, the minister 
said the number of these is on the decrease. Judicial errors 
are caused, in the minister's view, by low quality of 
preliminary investigation and court examination, excessive 
workload of judges, and in particular, by an inadeguate 
competence of some judges. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Aleksandr 
Livshits, leader of the group of experts to the president of the 
Russian Federation, who elucidates the president's economic 
reform policy line. The expert declined to indicate a specific 
time-frame for the signing of a second package of presidential 
economic decrees but said that one will not have to wait for 
this "for several months". 
  According to Livshits, the main aspects of the presidential 
policy are to decide what to do with debtor enterprises, work 
out a single procedure for the provision of privileges to 
enterprises, adopt specific decrees dealing with investment, to 
attract foreign investments to the production sphere, in 
particular, and to bring about changes in the banking sector. 
  In TRUD, Vladimir Gusev raises financial problems connected 
with taxation policy. The existing taxation system accords with 
the realities of the country's present-day economic situation 
but it is in need of certain adjustment, he told the newspaper. 
Gusev considers it necessary to sharply reduce the number of 
taxes and suggests delimiting clearly the competence and powers 
of legislative power bodies in the centre and at the local level 
to introduce new types of taxes. A decrease in the number of 
taxes, in his view, should automatically lead to an easing of 
the tax burden. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries an article reporting that 
Konstantin Tsiolkovskiy, a great Russian scientist, the founder 
and theoretician of cosmonautics, was arrested in Kaluga in 1919 
and escorted to Moscow wehre he was kept for two weeks in the 
building of the extraordinary commission to combat 
counterrevolution, sabotage and speculation (cheka) on Lubyanka. 
The article is written by the newspaper's own correspondent 
Boris Sopelnyak, who was one of the first journalists to see 
case no. 1,096 on "counterrevolutionary activity" charges 
against the scientist. 
  In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of 
Russia's security council, comments on the presidential decree 
"on urgent measures to implement a federal programme to step up 
action to combat crime in 1994-1995". It is emphasised that, as 
a result of the measures, the numerical strength of police and 
special-purpose troops is to increase by 52,000 men. 
  In KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, Tyeri Meira, leader of the Moscow 
delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC), said that from January to March 1994 alone, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), sent 505,700 
swiss francs worth of food parcels to Azerbaijan victims of 
conflict, and 141,500 swiss francs worth of food aid to Armenia. 
The committee also provided relief to residents of Abkhazia and 
Georgia and victims of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, Meira told 
the newspaper. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries Air Marshal Yevgeniy 
Shaposhnikov's article dealing with the Russian-NATO 
relationships. The invitation to join NATO's Partnership for 
Peace programme placed Russia before a difficult and responsible 
choice, the marshal writes, examining probable situations and 
possible consequences of such a choice. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA points out that there is a shortage of 
housing in Moscow for more than 7,000 servicemen, mostly senior 
officers of the main and central departments of the Defence 
Ministry. "In Soviet times, high-ranking servicemen were on 
housing waiting lists for two years at most. Nowadays 102 
generals and admirals in Moscow and 169,700 officers in the 
whole of Russia have no housing". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, under the rubric "For Slow Reading", runs 
Lev Navrozov's article headlined "How `PRAVDA' and `Zhirinovskiy 
PRAVDA' understand polemics". Navrozov carries on his debate 
with LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and his supporters on 
various political aspects.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuliy Semenov from the Kremlin in </F>
Moscow -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Twenty minutes ago an official 
meeting ceremony was held for South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam and his wife in the St. George Hall of the Moscow 
Kremlin. What can I tell you? Our guest is very dynamic and 
smiles a lot, but at the same time he is known as a gifted and 
far-sighted politician who, among other things, began to 
establish contacts with the Soviet Union and Russia even before 
official relations between Russia and South Korea were 
re-established. 
  Ten minutes ago a tete-a-tete meeting between Presidents Kim 
Yong-sam and Yeltsin started in the so-called Green 
Drawing-Room. Whereas they had an unofficial meeting last night 
in Staro-Ogarevo, today's meeting opens a formal negotiating 
process. Simultaneously, the foreign ministers are holding 
talks at the so-called Yellow Drawing-Room. There they are 
expected to sign the first agreement on the protection of 
migratory birds, together with a protocol on the consultations 
between the foreign ministries. At the same time, two more 
agreements -- on environment protection and on preventing 
incidents at sea -- will be initialled. They will be signed but 
a subsequent approval of the presidents will be required. 
  Then there will be talks in St. Catherine's Hall attended by 
the delegations in full and at about 1130 in St. Vladimir's Hall 
of the Kremlin, President Yeltsin is to hand over to his guest a 
package of documents relating to the so-called Korean war of the 
1950's. These are archive documents, many of them secret, and 
they should help create a fuller picture of the events of the 
period. 
  Then a Russian-Korean declaration will be signed. This is an 
extensive and serious document. I can tell you that one of its 
highlights is Russia's proposal that a conference on making the 
Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone should be held with all 
interested states taking part. 
  When this official program has been completed, Russia's 
president and his guest are to move to a building next door 
where a news conference of the Russian and Korean presidents 
will take place. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
ROK President Kim Yong-sam, who is in Moscow on an official 
visit, today signed a joint Russian-Korean declaration in the 
Kremlin on completion of their bilateral summit. The document 
proclaims the raising of bilateral relations to a level of 
mutually complementary constructive partnership, and reflects 
the two sides' approaches to the main problems of both world 
politics, including the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula, 
and to questions of cooperation between Moscow and Seoul in the 
economic, political, and other spheres. 
  A number of other bilateral documents were also signed, 
including intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in 
protection of the environment, on preventing incidents at sea 
outside territorial waters, and on the protection of migratory 
birds, and also a protocol on consultations between the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the 
ROK. 
  The South Korean side was handed more than 200 archive 
documents relating to the Korean War during 1950-53. They 
include correspondence conducted by the then leaders of the 
USSR, the DPRK, and the PRC, with telegrams from Josip Stalin 
and Mao Tse-tung, and they reveal the degree of the former 
Soviet Union's involvement in the Korean War. "History should 
stand revealed in its true form," a high-ranking official of the 
Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry said in a conversation 
with the ITAR-TASS correspondent. He said the handing over of 
archive documents would make it possible to "close one of the 
pages of the past." At the same time, the sides are united in 
the opinion that the sad past in relations between Moscow and 
Seoul should remain in the past and should not affect the 
present and future.

  [Text] Moscow, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
announced a "constructive and mutually complementary 
partnership" at Thursday's [2 June] summit, promising broad 
cooperation ranging from the economy to the North Korean nuclear 
and regional security issues. 
  Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Boris Yeltsin wrapped up the 
second day of their summit by issuing a joint declaration 
supporting Moscow's ongoing reforms and a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula. 
  Delving into the finer points of bilateral relations, the 
declaration says Yeltsin promised to give favorable 
consideration to South Korea's bid for non-permanent U.N. 
Security Council membership while Seoul will do the same for 
Russia's application to join the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC). 
  Moscow agreed with Seoul's insistence on maintaining the 
present Korean armistice regime until a new peace structure can 
be created between the two Koreas. 
  To implement the new partnership, the two countries plan to 
engage in more active political dialogue at all levels including 
heads of state and government figures. 
  Kim arrived in Moscow Wednesday for a four-day visit that 
began with a dinner meeting on the day of his arrival and 
continued with a second summit round Thursday. 
  "The presidents declared that the relationship between the 
Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation is now turning into 
a `constructive and mutually complementary partnership' based on 
the common values of freedom, democracy, rule of law, respect 
for human rights and a market economy," the declaration read. 
  Much of the declaration was given over to an emphasis on 
finding common principles between the two countries and 
expressing support for each other's stands on key issues. 
  Kim reassured Yeltsin of Seoul's support for and cooperation 
with the ongoing reform process in Russia and pledged to promote 
human rights improvement. 
  They found common ground in seeking a security dialogue 
among 
Northeast Asian countries and agreed to keep open a bilateral 
channel on formulating a regional security forum. 
  They took note of the other side's concerns, chiefly South 
Korea's position on the North Korean nuclear crisis. 
  "President Yeltsin confirmed that Russia, along with the 
states involved, will continue to play an active part in the 
efforts of the international community to achieve the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the declaration 
states. 
  Recording that Kim explained his country's bid for a 
non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, it notes that 
"President Yeltsin promised to consider it favorably." 
  Likewise, Kim "welcomed Russia's intention to participate 
actively and constructively in all areas of Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation and... Would give favorable consideration 
to the candidacy of the Russian Federation for APEC membership 
when the matter is taken up at future APEC fora." 
  They touched briefly on clearing up the awkward past, with 
Kim thanking Moscow for its efforts in restoring the dignity of 
ethnic Koreans in Russia, handing over documents related to the 
downing of a Korean air passenger jet in 1983 by a Soviet 
fighter jet and delivery of archival documents on the Korean war. 
  On the economic front, Kim and Yeltsin hoped to combine 
Russian technology with the industrial know-how of South Korea 
and to encourage investment in developing Russia's natural 
resources. 
  Capping the declaration, the presidents state they will 
"intensify the political dialogue at various levels, including 
summit meetings of the heads of state or government, parliament 
leaders and ministers."

  [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
will soon establish a trade committee to discuss ways to promote 
and strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade, 
investment and technology. 
  The committee's creation was agreed in Moscow on Thursday 
when the two nations' trade ministers signed a memorandum to 
that effect. Attending the meeting were Korean Trade, Industry 
and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and Russian Foreign Economic 
Relations Minister Oleg Davydov. Kim Chol-su is accompanying 
President Kim Yong-sam on his state visit to Russia. 
  The ministers agreed to hold the committee's first meeting 
in 
Seoul this year to be headed by the two sides' assistant 
ministers. 
  During the meeting, Russia promised to continue offering 
preferential tariffs for Korean goods that are half the most- 
favored-nation rate. In addition, Moscow said it will dispatch 
an evaluation team to Korea to designate six more 
safety-certifying agents for easier customs clearance of Korean 
goods bound to be shipped to Russia. 
  They also agreed to set up a working-level committee to 
support construction of a Korea-Russia Trade Center at a site 
owned by Moscow University Campus. 
  Minister Kim pointed out that there is still 755 million 
U.S. 
dollars receivable from Russia for Korean exports, saying this 
uncollected money resulted from a foreign currency freeze in 
December 1990 imposed by the former Soviet Union's External 
Economic Bank. 
  With regard to Minister Kim's call for early settlement of 
Russia's outstanding receivables, Davydov proposed a meeting in 
Moscow to discuss terms of payment and creditor-confirmation 
procedures.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia has every reason 
to be optimistic about the prospects for relations with the 
Republic of Korea [ROK]. Russia regards relations between the 
two countries as those of constructive good-neighborliness. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said this at a joint news 
conference today with ROK President Kim Yong-sam. 
  President Yeltsin said that at the talks with the ROK 
president, which ended in Moscow today, Russia's task is "not so 
much to take stock of what has been done, as to ensure that 
there is a good future for cooperation, that the leap forward 
which we made in 1992 should continue, that our relations should 
become stronger, and that our fundamental accords should be 
filled with new specific deeds." 
  Boris Yeltsin said that a new Moscow declaration has been 
signed with the president of Korea. In his opinion, it is "a 
major political document looking solely to the future." The 
Russian president believes that following the treaty on the 
fundamentals of bilateral relations, signed in Seoul in November 
1992, this declaration is "a new step forward in mutually 
beneficial cooperation." In the opinion of Boris Yeltsin, an 
agreement to start next year on a regular exchange of young 
people will enable the peoples of Russia and Korea to learn more 
about one another, and also looks to the future. 
  "We have said many times", the Russian president stressed, 
"that we are interested in full-scale economic relations, that 
we would like to see a growth of investments by South Korean 
firms in our economy, especially in the Far East." 
  Boris Yeltsin believes that active participation by the 
companies of the Republic of Korea in the conversion of Russian 
military industry could also become mutually beneficial. The 
Russian president said that some considerable mutual 
understanding has been reached on these issues. 
  At the talks with the Korean president, considerable 
attention was paid to examining the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula in the context of nuclear non-proliferation. Russia, 
as Boris Yeltsin stressed, "is extremely worried at the 
unsettled nature of the nuclear question in this region, and 
Russia bases itself on the premise that the DPRK should remain a 
fully fledged member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
and should fully implement its commitments under the 
verification agreement with the IAEA." 
  "This is our fundamental line," the Russian president 
stated. 
  "At the same time," he pointed out, "we consider that it is 
necessary to tackle the North Korean nuclear problem by 
political methods, without damaging the legitimate interests of 
all the sides involved therein." 
  One way of resolving this problem, Boris Yeltsin stressed, 
lies in implementing a Russian proposal on an international 
conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean 
Peninsula, with the participation of Russia, both Korean states, 
the United States, China, Japan, and also representatives of the 
United Nations and the IAEA. 
  At the talks with Kim Yong-sam, the question of the 100,000 
ethnic Koreans of Russian citizenship living in Russia was also 
touched on. "On our part," Boris Yeltsin noted, "it was 
stressed that Russian Koreans, like all Russians in our 
multi-ethnic country, have the right to state support, to the 
maintenance of their culture, language, and customs, and 
development of links with their historical motherland."

  [Text] Moscow June 2 TASS -- Russia believes it is yet 
premature to speak about sanctions against North Korea, but if 
the latter decides to secede from the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime Moscow will insist on a gradual approach to sanctions. 
  "If North Korea strives to secede from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, Russia will be forced to gradually 
begin solving the problem: make a warning and then the world 
community should adopt a decision on imposing sanctions on North 
Korea", Russian President Boris Yeltsin told a press conference 
on Thursday. He added, however, that it is premature to speak 
about sanctions as no decision has been yet adopted on convening 
an international conference on the nuclear problem of North 
Korea. 
  Yeltsin also said that both the Russian and South Korean 
leaderships are "greatly concerned about what is happenong in 
the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (PDRK) taken into 
consideration its direct closeness to the Russian eastern 
borders". 
  "We cannot be indifferent to how the PDRK treats the earlier 
signed Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are ready to act", 
Yeltsin said and admitted that the problem has been delayed for 
too long and "has no positive solution so far". 
  The Russian president said that he may discuss the problem 
with his US counterpart. 
  Speaking on the Soviet-North Korean friendship and 
cooperation treaty of 1961, Yeltsin recalled that an amendment 
had been introduced to its first article which envisaged an 
immediate military help to Pyongyang if the latter was attacked. 
Now "there is no strict provision envisaging that we help and 
side with the PDRK", Yeltsin said.

  [Text] Moscow, 1 June -- "The visit by the President of the 
Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, to Athens last year has set 
Russian-Greek relations into full swing. After many centuries 
of spiritual political and historical proximity, these relations 
have revived with the breath of fresh air." This had been stated 
by RF Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before he started talks 
with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias here today. 
  The head of the Russian foreign policy department said that 
he attached great importance to the current meeting, considering 
the big role Greece is playing in the Balkans and nowadays in 
Europe as head of the European Union. 
  The talks are centred on the issues concerning bilateral 
relations and preparations for the visit to Russia of the Greek 
prime-minister Andreas Papandreou at the end of the year. 
Regarding foreign policy, the sides intend to discuss the 
situation in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole, 
as well as the Cypriot and the Near East problems.

  [Text] A meeting took place in Moscow today between 
[Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey Kozyrev and Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias. Problems of bilateral relations and 
also questions of mutual interest were touched on during the 
meeting. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] Our relations are developing on 
the 
firm basis laid down by President Yeltsin's visit to Greece, and 
we have now mapped out preparations for a visit to Russia by 
Prime Minister Papandreou in August. [end recording] 
  Andrey Kozyrev went on to point out that the political will 
to develop economic relations exists between the two countries. 
Mutual interest in the sphere of the economy stretches from the 
southern regions to the far north. The two foreign ministers 
then went on to note an identity of views in settling the 
situation in Bosnia. The Greek foreign minister noted that the 
Yugoslav crisis can only be settled through the joint efforts of 
those sides who are truly interested in peace in this region.

Valeriy Sevryukov] 
  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russia and Greece have 
identical approaches towards resolving the Yugoslav crisis, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Greek 
counterpart Karolos Papoulias said on Wednesday. 
  Kozyrev said the Bosnian problem featured prominently at the 
talks because Russia and Greece "have traditional interests and 
influence in that region." 
  Additionally, he continued, "both of us are members of the 
initiative group of ministers which gathered in Geneva and we 
support direct contacts with Belgrade and other sides involved 
in the conflict. We have mapped out a number of additional 
steps to support the settlement process and stated practically 
full coincidence of our views." 
  "We also believe it necessary to strictly observe all 
international agreements, particularly the regime (of 
navigation) in Black Sea straits established in Montreux. Our 
positions on the Cypriot problem also coincide. It is important 
that the next U.N. Security Council discussion of the U.N. 
secretary-general's report on the talks on Cyprus lead to 
progress," Kozyrev said. 
  "Our contacts are developing on a firm basis established 
during (Russian President) Boris Yeltsin's visit to Athens last 
year," he added. He said Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou is expected to visit Moscow this autumn. 
  Kozyrev admitted that some complications may arise in 
bilateral relations, but what is much more important is that 
both countries have the political will and determination to 
develop multifaceted ties. 
  Papoulias also pointed to the coincidence of the positions 
of 
Russia and Greece on international problems, including on ways 
to settle the Bosnian conflict, Cypriot problem and navigation 
in the Black Sea. 
  He described relations between the two countries as 
"friendly 
and cordial" and said that there are no problems between Moscow 
and Athens. Papoulias invited Kozyrev to visit Greece in order 
to "continue the fruitful dialogue in the interests of the two 
countries."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Yuriy Kozlov, </F>
Valeriy Sevryukov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 1 Jun -- The church may play a significant 
positive role in the Balkans in settling the Bosnian crisis. 
This was stated here today to an ITAR-TASS correspondent by 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Besides talks with 
Russian diplomatic head Andrey Kozyrev the program for the Greek 
minister's visit has also included a meeting with Aleksiy II, 
the patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. 
  Touching on the importance of the efforts of the Russian 
Orthodox Church in the Balkans, Papoulias said: "We support 
such initiatives because they are aimed at defending peace. 
These are humane initiatives helping to settle many issues with 
due consideration for the historic role the Orthodox Church 
plays in the south of Europe." 
  One should not forget the common Orthodox roots existing 
between our peoples, the Greek minister continued. He noted 
that during their talks Kozyrev expressed anxiety over "the 
unpleasant incidents and provocations against the Universal 
Istanbul Patriarchic," which there had been in Istanbul. 
  The Russian foreign political department and the Russian 
Orthodox Church are in constant contact, Kozyrev told an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. We highly appreciate the peace-making 
efforts of Patriarch Aleksiy II. One should note that in our 
relationship with Greece and a number of other countries 
religion serves as "a firm spiritual foundation that imbues it 
with a cordial character". 
  The Russian minister cited specific examples related to 
Murmansk oblast from which he was elected a State Duma deputy. 
An Orthodox church is now being restored in Murmansk. 
Unfortunately, Kozyrev said, after 70 years of militant atheism 
it is being done practically from scratch and mainly through the 
efforts of parishioners and the public. At present at our 
request and with the most active participation of the Russian 
Orthodox Church our Greek co-religionists render help in 
creating an iconoclastic for this church. 
  Besides making use of the hospitality of Orthodox 
co-religionists, we send children from Russia's northern areas 
for rest and treatment in Greece which is famous for its 
heavenly climate. In the near future a trip to Greece by a group 
from Archangel is being prepared. To tell the truth, Irina 
Kozyreva, the minister's wife, could obviously tell about this 
in more detail as she heads the Russia's Care charitable 
foundation to help children on a voluntary basis.

  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin may visit the Greek island of Corfu (Kerkyra) in June to 
take part in the ceremony of signing an agreement between Russia 
and the European Union [EU], Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said on Wednesday. 
  The announcement was made after his talks with Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias who is in Moscow on a three-day 
official visit. 
  Relations between Russia and the EU featured prominently at 
the talks, Kozyrev said. He recalled that at present Greece 
holds presidency in the European Union and praised its support 
and assistance in the development of the agreement. 
  "I think that the history of this cooperation will continue 
and important events may take place before Greece hands over its 
presidency," he said. Kozyrev made it clear that the work on 
the agreement may be completed before June 24 when the EU 
leaders gather for their meeting in Corfu.

  [Text] Russia wants to upgrade Russian-Greek economic 
relations by launching new large scale projects, Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told Interfax following his meeting 
with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  These projects include the construction of an oil pipeline 
from Burgas, Bulgaria, into Greece. Shokhin said that this 
would be a new export route by-passing the Bosphorus and 
Dardanelles which might be closed for environmental reasons. 
  Under another project, Greek ship-owners would contribute to 
the revival of the Russian merchant fleet. 
  To the best of Interfax's knowledge, during the Papoulias 
visit to Moscow the two sides held intensive talks on the 
continuation of the construction of an alumina works and gas 
pipeline in Greece with Russian participation.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin report: "Is June </F>
the `Key' Month?"] 
  [Text] Zagreb, 1 Jun -- Moscow believes that June should 
be a "key" month in the attainment of a Bosnian peace settlement 
and possibly in resolving the whole set of problems in the 
Yugoslav crisis, Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's 
special representative, said Tuesday [31 May] in Zagreb during 
an exclusive interview with your ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  Speaking about holding a special summit meeting on the 
Bosnian settlement, V. Churkin noted that "if this summit has 
not been held by mid-June, say, more attention will probably be 
paid to Yugoslav affairs during the G-7 meeting in Naples, which 
will a G-8 meeting for the first time, with Russia's full 
participation in the discussion of political problems." 
  Commenting on the content of today's talks in Belgrade with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and also with Serbian 
leaders from Bosnia and Krajina, the Russian deputy foreign 
minister noted that priority during these talks was given to two 
issues -- the situation in Bosnia, with the emphasis on 
attaining an agreement on the cessation of hostilities; and the 
preparations for the next Geneva meeting, as well as for the 
resumption of talks between Zagreb and Knin. 
  The Russian president's special representative plans to meet 
with Alija Izetbegovic, chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidium, and Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo. 
  Tuesday evening V. Churkin was received in Zagreb by 
Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman. "We had a very good discussion during 
which Franjo Tudjman once again reaffirmed his high opinion of 
Russia's role in the Yugoslav settlement and Croatia's interest 
in continuing dialogue not only with Knin but also with Belgrade 
and in the overall normalization of bilateral relations, which 
play a key role in the complex of problems involved in the 
Yugoslav crisis," the Russian diplomat said.

  [Text] Zagreb June 2 TASS -- The UN and Russian envoys to 
former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi and Vitaliy Churkin left 
Zagreb for Geneva early on Thursday for a meeting on Bosnia, 
TASS was told at the Zagreb headquarters of the UN peace-keepers. 
  The Geneva talks were in question until the last moment 
because Akashi had no guarantees that Bosnian Serbs would stand 
up to their promise and withdraw their remaining units from the 
3-kilometre zone around Gorazde. The Muslim leadership refused 
to participate in the talks if the Serbs do not withdraw. 
  On Thursday Akashi received a message from Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic confirming that the troops would be 
withdrawn. 
  Churkin told TASS that the degree of readiness for the talks 
at which a complete end to hostilities in Bosnia is to be 
discussed, is "very high". He added that "serious discussions" 
would go [as received] about a number of details, but "chances 
for success are very high".

<F P=106> [Georgiy Bovt report: "Sam Nunn's Press Conference. Uncle </F>
Sam Is Disposed Peaceably But Won't Share"] 
  [Text] In the course of the ongoing visit to Moscow by a 
delegation of U.S. legislators led by Sam Nunn, head of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, the question of holding joint 
military exercises of the two countries, not in Russia alone but 
also on U.S. territory, was discussed. In the opinion of Mr. 
Nunn, voiced in yesterday's news briefing at the 
Russian-American press center, this will partially put at rest 
those in the Duma who mistrust joint military games with the 
Americans. At the same time the senator indicated his total 
rejection of Russia's claims for admission to the world arms 
markets. 
  Duma Defense Committee head Sergey Yushenkov; two chairmen 
of 
international affairs committees, Vladimir Podoprigora 
(Federation Council) and Vladimir Lukin (State Duma); and Sam 
Nunn could not sidestep the now inevitable "Partnership for 
Peace" topic. But nothing new in addition to commonplace 
phrases on the need for cooperation and respect for Russian 
statehood was heard. 
  Of greater interest is the other question touched upon -- 
the 
arms trade. Moscow's desire to "divide the market" (it was also 
repeated to Nunn by Andrey Kozyrev) runs against the United 
States' sustained resistance. Washington wishes to divide 
nothing because the capacity of the world arms market has in 
fact been dwindling in recent years. Russia's arguments that 
its position is especially difficult (saying the UN sanctions it 
religiously observes kicks back at it in the most painful way) 
are not being heeded: "Your allies are your problems." 
  The United States did at one time offer to divide the 
market, 
not according to regions (as Moscow would like to) but according 
to sectors. This makes one think about "the tops and roots 
tale" [a smart peasant let Bear, his partner, have the leaves of 
beetroot they planted and kept the roots in the fall. The next 
season they sowed oats; Bear wanted the roots and got them]: 
Russian products cannot compete in high-tech sectors, while 
their price in the obsolete weapons sector is not competitive. 
As Yushenkov put it, the senators "flexed their muscles" to 
show that "the U.S. grip on arms markets has not slackened." As 
for their Russian counterparts' argument, that this position 
would result in "the mafia's starting to sell weapons to the 
countries targeted by the UN sanctions at that," it failed to 
scare the Americans. Although they were not shy about admitting 
that the Russian S-300 missile system is better that the 
American "Patriot."

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "Joint Military Exercises Will </F>
Nonetheless Go Ahead. Only Not in Russia, But in the United 
States"] 
  [Text] The joint Russian-U.S. military exercises that were 
scheduled to be held in our country at Totskiy but were 
ultimately canceled for political reasons will nonetheless go 
ahead. But in the United States. 
  The proposal to hold the peacemaking forces' maneuvers 
abroad 
-- "in view of the domestic political situation in Russia" -- 
was made by Senator Sam Nunn, the influential chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee, at a meeting with his Russian 
colleagues in Moscow. His colleagues were enthusiastic about 
the idea. It is now up to the executive branches -- in Russia 
and the United States. Immediately on his return to Washington 
Nunn will discuss his proposal with President Clinton and 
Defense Secretary Perry. According to the senator, Americans 
will "give the Russian troops a good reception on their 
territory." 
  Admittedly, Russia will lose the $2 million that the United 
States would have paid us had the maneuvers been held at 
Totskiy. That would have been payment for the use of our 
military installations, infrastructure, etc. We will hardly be 
given any money if we send our servicemen to the United States. 
What is more we will evidently have to ask the Americans to 
fund the trip, which will undoubtedly be a costly one. 
  It is quite possible that if the maneuvers go well in the 
United States and our soldiers do in actual fact receive a 
cordial reception as if the Cold War had never taken place, the 
guarded suspicion which frustrated the plans to hold the 
exercises in Totskiy will ease and the next maneuvers will be 
held in Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Margarita Ziangirova: "U.S. Consul </F>
`Discovers Russia'"] 
  [Text] Omsk -- Representatives of U.S. big business know 
practically nothing about Russia. That view was expressed by 
Jack Segal, the consul general from the United States, on his 
arrival in Omsk. 
  A U.S. consulate opened nearly two months ago in 
Yekaterinburg -- the only one in central Russia thus far -- with 
Segal as its head. The U.S. diplomat was the first of his 
colleagues to come to the city on the Irtysh, visiting several 
industrial enterprises and the pedagogical and medical higher 
educational establishments as well as Omsk Oblast's 
Bolsherechenskiy Rayon. Jack Segal had a meeting with Omsk 
Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev. The consul promised to 
inform the U.S. Embassy and American business circles of the 
potential of the region's industry and to help establish 
business contacts. In Jack Segal's opinion, only a stable 
political and economic situation in Russia can promote the 
emergence and strengthening of such contacts in the first 
instance. This may also explain the fact that many foreign 
firms, having signed a considerable number of protocols with 
major industrial enterprises in Omsk, are in no hurry to 
complete the matter; which, indeed, causes some skepticism among 
the people of Omsk.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Abrosimov] </F>
  [Text] Sofia June 1 TASS -- The NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" plan should be signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
who is also the commander-in-chief of the national armed forces, 
but the country should not commit itself to signing the plan by 
a fixed date, according to Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian 
Security Council, who is currently on a visit to Bulgaria. 
  "There should be no haste in signing the `Partnership for 
Peace'. The Russian (military) might is comparable to that of 
NATO. We have first to understand what partnership we are being 
offered. It is inappropriate to commit ourselves to putting the 
signature by a fixed date because the talk is about a very 
important issue," he told TASS on Wednesday adding that "when 
time comes" the document should be signed by the Russian 
president. 
  Lobov stressed that the issue also depends on the NATO 
leadership, which has received Russian proposals on joining the 
organisation. "NATO has to voice its attitude towards them", he 
said. 
  "Russia has expressed its principled position -- it is for 
partnership. As far as concrete questions are concerned, such 
as armaments, the creation of corresponding structures and so 
on, their consideration needs time", Lobov said, and added that 
the Russian Security Council will discuss the results of the 
consideration. The top Russian security body has not yet voiced 
its point of view as the decision is currently being drafted, he 
explained. 
  He denied mass media allegations that the Security Council 
is 
not engaged in discussing the prospects of Russia's joining the 
"Partnership for Peace" plan. Lobov recalled that the Council 
includes the president, the defence, foreign and interior 
ministers, i.e. people who design the policy in this aspect. 
  Lobov is not confused by the fact that those people often 
voice different opinions on the question. "Each of them can have 
his own approach to the problem at the initial stage. Nuances 
in viewpoints of Security Council members should not be assessed 
as contradictions", he said, adding that the Security Council is 
a body where various opinions are discussed in order to arrive 
to the final conclusion.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Paris Displays Gallantry, Russia </F>
Does Not Resist"] 
  [Text] Paris -- The European Union [EU] has begun the 
creation of a mechanism designed to consolidate the continent's 
security. The new mechanism is aimed first and foremost at 
resolving the problems of nationalism, interethnic conflicts, 
and religious intolerance. 
  It is on a French initiative that work has begun on the 
Stability Pact, directed toward the nine states of Central and 
East Europe, including the three Baltic countries, which have 
declared their intention to join the EU's ranks. A meeting of 
delegations from 57 European countries was held in Paris as part 
of this. The forum examined the problems of stability from the 
standpoint of democracy and human rights, not in a military 
context. 
  "We are ready to accept the new members into our ranks," 
Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs, noted, 
"but we do not want to open the doors to new conflicts." 
  The focal points of possible conflict are connected with the 
position of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltics and 
the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia. The EU 
expects these countries to go through a "preparatory class" 
prior to joining, where they will learn the rules of good 
conduct. 
  Paris favors the earliest possible signing of an agreement 
on 
partnership and cooperation between the EU and Moscow (it seems 
that this will happen as early as June) and is energetically 
supporting Russia's admission to all the European institutions. 
  After some hesitation, Moscow supported the French 
initiative. It believes that the Stability Pact should not exist 
as a separate entity but should form an organic part of the CSCE 
fabric. In Moscow's view, another major aspect of this pact is 
the fact that the document is based on the principle of the 
inviolability of borders. Furthermore, to all appearances it 
will promote the protection of the rights of the Russians in the 
Baltics. 
  The Paris conference has begun work on the pact which will 
end with its signature in about a year. After the adoption of 
the basic document by consensus at the present meeting, regional 
talks will be held. The first talks will be on the rights of 
minorities in the Baltics. 
  Andrey Kozyrev proposed the creation of a European 
University 
in one of the Baltic states, where instruction would be given in 
the local language and in Russian.

for non-trade operations," the resolution underlined.

  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, 
Semenov said that the troops in the Kaliningrad region, Russia's 
westernmost enclave, are not an "armoured fist threatening the 
Baltic Sea countries", and fulfill the tasks aimed at ensuring 
the national security of Russia. 
  He also stressed that Russia strictly observes its 
international commitments. Semenov said there are as many tanks 
and troops in the Kaliningrad regions as is necessary to ensure 
Russia's security.

  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- A Russian Government press 
service official denied mass media reports on Wednesday that 
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will visit Tbilisi 
during his vacation. 
  The official said that Chernomyrdin may visit Novorossiyisk 
where a new Russian port is being built, but most likely in the 
second half of his vacation. 
  The Russian prime minister is now vacationing on the Black 
Sea. His spokesman Valeriy Grishin said earlier today that 
during the vacation Chernomyrdin will continue working on the 
second package of economic decrees which is now being drawn up 
by the government. 
  The spokesman said that until the last minute it was not 
clear whether or not Chernomyrdin will take his leave now, 
mainly because of his active involvement in the work on the 
package of economic decrees aimed at continuing economic reforms 
in Russia. The first package was recently signed by President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  Grishin denied reports that Chernomyrdin would work on his 
book during his vacation. "There will be simply no time left for 
that. Besides, he needs rest too," he said.

Defense"] 
  [Text] On 30 May Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
Federation minister of defense, held a meeting with Michaela 
Geiger, parliamentary state secretary of the FRG Ministry of 
Defense in the Bundestag. Pavel Grachev noted that Russia's 
proposals on the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program were 
greeted with understanding among practically all the 
participants in the talks during the recent visit by the head of 
the Russian military department to the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. Only certain details remain to be elaborated. Russia 
will be able to join the "Partnership for Peace" program within 
two or three weeks, P. Grachev noted. But for this to happen, 
Western countries should study these proposals and draw up a 
document through diplomatic channels which would express 
agreement with Russia's proposals. 
  The Russian defense minister's optimism is also connected 
with the fact that when he was in Brussels, Pavel Grachev "saw 
support for the Russian proposals on the part of FRG Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe." "The greater the country the more they 
understand us," the head of the Russian military department 
noted. Unfortunately, unlike the ministers of defense of NATO 
countries, from whom Pavel Grachev perceived support and "a good 
attitude toward me and toward Russia," to use his own words, the 
CIS countries do not always display understanding toward the 
problems facing Moscow.

many a matter concerning Russian-Kuwaiti cooperation in this 
respect. 
  "But it is up to your parliament to decide on whether to 
endorse or turn down funds necessary for the purchase of this

  Russia would welcome Kuwaiti investments in various branches 
of the Russian economy to promote economic reform, Soskovets

  [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The Kuwaiti Embassy in Moscow 
has learnt that some Russian pro-Iraqi groups have circulated a 
statement to demand cancellation of economic sanctions against 
Iraq. They have also held a rally under this slogan in front of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry's building, says a statement for 
the press circulated by the embassy today. 
  The document was circulated before a news conference of head 
of the Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation and the Kuwaiti 
parliament Ahmad al-Sa'dun at the Russian State Duma. 
  The embassy is closely watching the activities of these 
groups. It reminds that economic sanctions against Baghdad were 
used in response to devastating consequences of the Iraqi attack 
at Kuwait. 
  If these groups really want to stop sufferings of the Iraqi 
people from sanctions, they should appeal to the Saddam Husayn 
regime and persuade it of the only way to achieve this goal - 
unconditional fulfillment of all resolutions of the United 
Nations Security Council on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi problem, says the 
document. 
  Iraq should recognize the Kuwaiti sovereignty and respect 
its 
territorial integrity, it should free and return home all POWs 
and civilians and unconditionally recognize the U.N. Security 
Council resolutions on demarcation of the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border, 
notes the statement.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Viktor Dmitriyev] </F>
  [Text] Caracas, 1 Jun -- The processes of democratization 
and economic change which Russia and Venezuela are going through 
are in many ways alike and we are hoping to develop relations 
between our countries further. Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
said this in a message to President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela, 
which was conveyed to him on 31 May by Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman of the Federation Council, who is on a visit here. 
Shumeyko is leading a delegation from the Russian parliament on 
an official tour of a number of Latin American countries. The 
delegation has already been to Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. 
  The head of the delegation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent 
that he had given R. Caldera a draft treaty on the bases of 
relations between the two countries. According to V. Shumeyko, 
a similar document was given to Venezuela last year, but 
consideration of it was put off because of political problems 
being experienced at that time by both countries. "The time has 
now come to go back to it, and the president of Venezuela and 
the foreign minister fully agree with me on this," the head of 
delegation said. 
  On the same day the chairman of the Federation Council 
addressed the Senate of the National Congress of Venezuela. "We 
are firmly convinced that the Latin American states, including 
Venezuela, are potentially important partners for us in the 
realm of political, commercial, and economic relations," V. 
Shumeyko said. "Our task is to maintain and increase as far as 
we are able our presence in the region and continue mutually 
advantageous relations with the countries of Latin America, on 
the basis of a realistic vision of our common interests and 
capacities and rejecting ideology-based approaches and 
stereotypes." The head of the Russian delegation expressed an 
interest in setting up contacts with leading regional 
organizations like the OAS and the Rio de Janeiro Group. 
  Speaking about ties with individual countries in Latin 
America, V. Shumeyko stated the Russian leadership's intention 
to continue cooperation on many levels with Cuba. He said this 
cooperation "after certain difficulties is once again becoming 
active and is founded on a fundamentally new, mutually 
beneficial basis." 
  V. Shumeyko stressed the importance of developing 
interparliamentary ties with the countries of Latin America. 
Having pointed out that the Russian parliament has a colossal 
job of work to do to bring outdated legislation into line with 
the stipulations of the new Constitution, the head of the 
Federation Council stressed that Russia's parliament is very 
much in need of foreign experience, including that of the Latin 
American countries. 
  During meetings with representatives of the government, 
members of parliament, and journalists, V. Shumeyko several 
times mentioned economic cooperation between Russia and 
Venezuela. According to him, there are now favorable conditions 
for the development of these ties. He said that the extraction, 
processing, and distribution of oil is one of the main areas. 
The chairman of the Federation Council stated the desire of 
Russia's leadership to resume the practice current up to 1991 of 
supplying Russian oil to Venezuela's partners in Western Europe 
in exchange for equivalent supplies of oil from Venezuela to 
Russia's partners in the Western hemisphere. Another important 
aspect is the construction of assembly lines producing Russian 
VAZ and KamAZ motor vehicles, which have a good reputation on 
Venezuela's roads. V. Shumeyko also noted highly promising 
prospects for cooperation in mining and advanced technology.

  [Text] Quito June 2 TASS -- "In spite of the huge distance, 
separating Russia and Ecuador, our two countries are unanimous 
in their desire for peace, broader democracy and economic 
renovation," Chairman of the Council of the Federation (upper 
chamber of the Russian parliament) Vladimir Shumeyko told 
journalists at the airport here on Wednesday. He heads a 
Russian parliamentary delegation which arrived here from 
Venezuela. This is the last lap of its official tour of several 
Latin American states, including Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and 
Venezuela. 
  "The Russian Federation's special friendliness towards the 
Republic of Ecuador is confirmed by President Boris Yeltsin's 
message, which I will present to President Sixto Duran-Ballen 
Cordovez," Shumeyko added. "An Ecuador-Russia chamber of 
commerce will be inaugurated during the delegation's visit to 
Ecuador, the very name of which testifies to the country's 
unique geographical location." Shumeyko is expected to address 
local businessmen, while members of the delegation will meet 
representatives from the government, parliament and business 
circles. 
  The agenda of the delegation's stay in Ecuador includes a 
visit to the Galapagos Islands. This unique preserve, declared 
the property of all mankind by the UNESCO, is under the 
jurisdiction of Ecuador. 
  On the eve of its departure from Venezuela, the delegation 
met leaders of the Ministry for Power and Mining. The 
Venezuelan side touched on the possibility of Russia's accession 
to the OPEC, stressing that their country would welcome such a 
step. Chairman of the Committee for Economic Reforms, Property 
and Property Relations of the Council of the Federation Vitaliy 
Zelenkin assured the Venezuelans that the Russian leadership was 
closely following all the OPEC activities. He said that the 
question of Russia's accession to that organisation might be 
considered shortly. 
  The talk also touched on the resumption of bilateral 
cooperation within the frameworks of the so-called "oil 
triangle", interest in which was expressed by Russian 
representatives. Until 1991, the USSR had delivered oil to 
several European countries to meet Venezuela's commitments to 
them, while the latter supplied oil to Russian partners in the 
Western hemisphere, primarily Cuba. The sides agreed to discuss 
these subjects during the visit that is to be paid to Moscow by 
the Venezuelan minister for power and mining. The visit is 
expected to take place already this year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- About 1,000 Russian 
specialists work in China, well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS 
on Wednesday. 
  However, the sources denied reports published by the U.S. 
NEWS AND WORLD REPORT magazine that "thousands" of scientists 
and technicians from the former Soviet Union work under 
contracts in China and help design and produce modern weapons. 
  "I do not rule out that there may be contracts under which 
our technical specialists go to China. But I doubt it very much 
that there are so many of them. All the more so because so 
sensitive spheres of cooperation are involved. I think that if 
such cases exist, there are only a few of them," a Russian 
Foreign Ministry top official said. 
  "`Thousands' is an absurd figure. Until lately we did not 
have facts that someone worked in the sphere of arms 
production," an official with the Russian foreign intelligence 
service said. 
  However, other sources said that China has certain interest 
in Russian specialists, particularly in the sphere of aircraft 
building. Those who go to China are either of no interest for 
western countries, or know too much to be allowed to go to the 
west. In China they earn about 1,000 U.S. dollars a month on the 
average. This is much less than they could make in the west, but 
much more than they earned in Russia, the sources said.

<F P=106> ["Brief commentary" by station commentator Mulatov from the </F>
"Half an Hour With Wang Xiao" program] 
  [Text] The seven agreements between Russia and China 
signed during the Russian delegation's visit will strengthen and 
continue the equal and mutually beneficial cooperation achieved 
over the last few years in economics, trade, science and 
technology, and other fields. Setting their sights on the 
future [words indistinct] the two countries have decided to 
raise the neighborly and friendly relations between them to a 
new level of development -- says a report on the outcome of 
[words indistinct] visit to China. The document, which sums up 
the outcome of the visit, also says the two countries will take 
full advantage of their geographical closeness and make full use 
of the complementariness between the two countries' economies. 
Both Moscow and Beijing understand that the neighborly and 
friendly relations and the mutually beneficial cooperation 
between them are in line with the fundamental interests of the 
two countries and their peoples and are an important factor for 
preserving peace and stability and for ensuring development in 
the Asia-Pacific region as well as in the whole world. We also 
like to point out that the Russian delegation's visit to China 
was widely reported in detail by the media of Eastern and 
Western countires. At the beginning, some Western media doubted 
that Russia might have an intention to develop bilateral 
military technology cooperation with China. Such cooperation 
will be developed under the condition that the two countries 
fulfill their international obligations -- this should not cause 
anyone to be suspicions. 
  During the talks, the two sides stressed the importance of 
reaching an agreement on taking measures as soon as possible to 
reduce their troops and armament and military trainings in 
disputed areas. They believed this will not only enhance mutual 
trust and understanding between the two countries, but also will 
contribute to preserving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  During their talks, Chernomyrdin and Li Peng also discussed 
international issues of common interest. The two countries' 
identical and similar stands on some major international issues 
were confirmed. This will be the foundation for the two 
countries to strengthen their constructive cooperation in 
regional and world affairs. 
  In short, the dialogue between the two governments has 
yielded good results. Currently, the two sides are preparing 
for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Russia. The two 
countries believe that positive dialogues at all levels, 
including the highest level, are prerequisites for promoting 
neighborly and friendly relations and mutually beneficial 
cooperation between them.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Nadashkevich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 1 Jun -- A high-ranking spokesman for the 
Russian Foreign Ministry today called a contract for the sale to 
Malaysia of 18 MiG-29 fighters expected to be signed in Kuala 
Lumpur on Tuesday "the deal of the century". "We are in the 
South-East Asia arms market for the first time after 30 years' 
absence, having cut it all back after the events in Indonesia in 
1965," he said in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  According to Anatoliy Khmelnitskiy, deputy director of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry Second Department for Asia, the 
contract was finally agreed "literally just a few hours ago" and 
there are no outstanding issues. It remains only to sign the 
document, which will happen on 7 June. The first Russian 
fighter will be supplied in April next year. Full 
implementation of the project is calculated to take 25 years, as 
it concerns creating a broad infrastructure in Malaysia. 
  There has been a fierce struggle since 1992 among major 
foreign arms producing companies for the Malaysia contract, 
which Russia has won. Now, after Malaysia, there are specific 
proposals coming from other countries in the region, Anatoliy 
Khmelnitskiy said. We need to be quick, the market is full of 
offers, the Russian diplomat stressed.

<F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Vegetation" rubric: </F>
"`People's Patriotic Union' Needs a Great Russia and Socialism. 
Only `Genuine Patriots' Will Be Admitted to The Newest Political 
Organization"] 
  [Text] Today's Russia, "robbed and divided by 
multinational companies," will become revived "as a Great 
Power... on the road of socialism" only through the efforts of 
patriots whose unity is supposed to lend them strength. The 
founders of a "People's Patriotic Union" (PPU) see no other road 
for their country, as they stated at the debut of the new 
(three-week-old) political organization of patriotic orientation. 
  That the patriotic spectrum of the Russian political reality 
is saturated does not deter members of the PPU coordination 
council, who include Boris Isayev, Yuriy Voronin, and Boris 
Tarasov among others. According to PPU Coordination Council 
Chairman Aleksandr Sarychev, "The more parties, the better; 
natural selection will take over and the unnecessary ones will 
die out." Besides, Mr. Sarychev explained, the new "Union" 
called upon to unite "only genuine patriots of Russia," without 
engaging in a standoff with the patriotic camp, will at the same 
time become an alternative to it owing to the fact that the PPU 
"is not going to thrust any philosophical dogmas on anyone." 
  The "Union" is open for individual and collective 
membership, 
and for the sake of the revival of Russia it is prepared to 
cooperate with everybody save "extremists, nationalists, and 
fascists." Mr. Sarychev declined to specify whom precisely the 
PPU regards as fascists and nationalists, voicing the hope that 
"these organizations may change their mind yet and give up their 
current ideas." 
  An economic program that the PPU has already managed to 
start 
formulating was described by one of its developers, Yuriy 
Voronin, doctor of economic sciences. Recognizing that 
"Gaydar's course of reforms" has "the right to exist," and 
denying this right to "today's resultant changes made by 
pseudo-democrats," Mr. Voronin maintained that bringing the 
country out of "the structural crisis is possible only through 
increasing in every way the state's influence on the economy." 
As for prosperity, the chief economist of the PPU is convinced, 
Russia can achieve it "only if it embarks on the road of a 
socially just system -- socialism." The compilers of the 
program allow for free market and private ownership elements, 
however, but only "in proportions acceptable for Russia." 
  In their day-to-day activities members of the PPU will be, 
"without endless meetings,... constructively criticizing the 
government" and preparing in their own midst competent 
politicians for all the power branches. "People's Patriots," 
according to the assurances of their leaders, do not share the 
calls by some opposition parties for early presidential 
elections since they are confident that a disunited opposition 
will be defeated. In this connection, the "People's Patriotic 
Union," which so far has 562 members, is planning, without 
hastening events or limiting their activities to Moscow, to 
create their structures all over Russia. In a single, organized 
bloc, Borisov is confident, the "patriots will come to power 
beyond any doubt."

<F P=106> [Valeriy Rudnev article: "Aleksey Ilyushenko's Powers Have </F>
Been Terminated, but He Is Continuing To Perform the Duties of 
General Prosecutor"] 
  [Text] As we know, on 25 April the Federation Council 
rejected the nomination of Aleksey Ilyushenko for the post of 
general prosecutor as put forward by the president, and 
suggested to Boris Yeltsin that he should submit a new candidate 
for this high office within two weeks. Since then a month has 
passed. A. Ilyushenko's powers, as instructed by the upper 
chamber of our parliament, have been terminated, but he is 
continuing to perform the duties of general prosecutor. 
  The issue of the general prosecutor's position would not 
have 
been the focus of such intense public interest if A. 
Ilyushenko's duties been restricted to administrative, economic, 
and cadre issues. Ultimately, however, somebody must administer 
the complex prosecutor's office: Sign reports, hire and fire 
personnel, distribute responsibilities, and mete out punishment 
and encouragement. 
  But this is precisely where the problem lies, the fact that 
the general prosecutor is not just the director of a department, 
but first and foremost a procedural figure whose rights and 
responsibilities are strictly regulated by the Constitution and 
the law. The slightest deviation from the procedure for 
appointing a general prosecutor and installing him in office 
casts doubt on the legality of his decisions and could paralyze 
the activity not only of the Prosecutor's Office but of other 
legal departments as well. 
  Strictly speaking, the law does not recognize the position 
of 
acting general prosecutor. There is a general prosecutor 
appointed in compliance with all the formalities. It is clear 
that a quick decision was needed in the acute political 
situation which developed after the sudden resignation of A. 
Kazannik. Only the president could make such a decision. And 
he made the following decision: A temporary, acting director 
was appointed to the Prosecutor's Office. Let us assume that 
during the two-week period stipulated by the Federation Council, 
A. Ilyushenko's stint in the job of general prosecutor was 
entirely proper and correct. And then what? 
  What would happen, for example, if A. Ilyushenko were to 
turn 
up at a session of the Russian Federation Supreme Court 
Presidium and deliver a judgment on some question or other, for 
example on the practice of applying the death penalty? How 
should the highest legal office respond to this? Should it take 
account of A. Ilyushenko's opinion as the judgment of the fully 
empowered general prosecutor? Or should it regard him as an 
ordinary legal officer, despite the fact that he happens to be 
acting general prosecutor? 
  But let us not bog ourselves down with rhetorical questions 
of this kind -- for the time being A. Ilyushenko is not daring 
to come to Supreme Court sessions. On the other hand, having 
gotten a feel for cadre reshuffles (his most recent involved the 
replacement of practically all the general prosecutor's 
deputies), he has started to make procedural decisions like a 
real constitutional general prosecutor. For example, the length 
of time defendants can be remanded in custody has been extended 
to 18 months. 
  One of the first such decisions he made concerned the case 
of 
Dmitriy Fedorov. This is a fairly well-known case which has 
attracted considerable press attention, including information 
provided by the militia. For a year now specialists from the 
investigation department of the Moscow Internal Affairs Main 
Administration have been trying to prove the successful 
businessman guilty. Admittedly, they are acting in accordance 
with the old procedures: First of all they take the suspect 
into custody, then they begin to look for evidence against him. 
But the indications are that all has not gone smoothly in the 
investigation's quest for evidence: Fedorov has been in custody 
for a year, he has not been presented with any evidence, and the 
case has not been sent to court. And there is no sign of its 
coming to court in the near future either, because over the year 
the investigation has visited Fedorov just twice, and that was 
for formal reasons. 
  However, the issue is ultimately nothing to do with the 
investigation and evidence in the Fedorov case -- it is about 
the position of Russia's acting general prosecutor. He signed 
the decree extending the length of custody. The die is cast, so 
to speak. And now the question arises: Is Aleksey Ilyushenko 
empowered to make procedural decisions which have legal 
consequences when the only person empowered to do this is the 
constitutionally appointed general prosecutor? 
  We will soon get an answer -- following a complaint by 
Fedorov's lawyer, the legality of extending the length of time 
Fedorov may be held in custody will be checked by a court.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Banking on the State </F>
Apparatus, or the Latest Attempt To Overcome the Crisis"] 
  [Text] There is every basis for calling the publication by 
the Russian president of a package of economic edicts, and also 
news of his support for an increase in budget expenditure of 
almost 28 trillion rubles, the most important political events 
of the past week. Despite their strictly economic content, the 
political consequences of these decisions are quite major. 
  These two facts alone are entirely sufficient to draw the 
conclusion that changes are taking place today in the Kremlin, 
and there are grounds for talking about a search for a new 
political strategy to overcome the crisis. The situation looks 
all the more important in the light of the spiraling decline of 
the regime's social, financial, and military support. 
  The president received the most recent painful blow from the 
State Duma, which officially questioned the results of the 
referendum on the Constitution and instructed the Credentials 
Commission to verify the vote. This, despite the opinion of 
representatives of the president's team, is a blow to the 
legitimacy of the president, not of the Federal Assembly. It is 
the fate of the referendum that is at stake. In addition, 
according to natural law, power should belong to the people and 
their representatives. Therefore, in subjecting the results of 
the elections and the referendum to review, the Duma in 
particular is risking very little. 
  In the course of the past month, since the start of the 
campaign to sign the Treaty on Social Accord, the president has 
adopted a number of decisions which contravene the Constitution 
and existing legislation. In addition to signing the Law on the 
Status of Deputy adopted by parliament -- which B. Yeltsin 
himself acknowledged as contravening the Constitution -- he has 
signed six economic edicts. And in the opinion of many 
specialists -- in particular Central Bank Chairman V. 
Gerashchenko -- they contravene such legislative acts currently 
in force as the Law on Enterprises, Property, and Bankruptcy and 
the RSFSR Civil Code. General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko remains 
in his post, despite the Constitution's requirements. The 
country still has no Constitutional Court. 
  It is perfectly obvious that a painful search is under way 
in 
the president's entourage for a solution to the unstable 
political situation, which is exacerbated by the intensifying 
economic crisis. The question is what this solution will be. 
  There are currently weighty grounds for suggesting that the 
choice could be made in favor of strengthening the state 
apparatus and the power of functionaries. At any rate, this 
follows from the revised draft of the federal budget. The role 
of the special services in politics is markedly increased. This 
is confirmed not only by the president's speech to officers of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service last week. Among the 
edicts signed by B. Yeltsin last week is one extremely curious 
edict which has nothing to do with the economy: the edict 
setting up another department in the Presidential Staff -- for 
collaboration with the Federal Assembly. Though it is well 
known that structures ensuring collaboration with parliament 
have been functioning smoothly in the Presidential Staff for a 
long time already. This includes the president's official 
representative, A.M. Yakovlev. 
  One of the department's officially defined tasks is "to 
inform the president on the mutual relations among the factions 
and groups of deputies in the Federal Assembly chambers." A. 
Loginov, who formerly worked in the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, 
has been put in charge of the new department. In recalling him, 
his former colleagues from the ministry slap one another on the 
back knowingly. 
  It seems that this tendency, which can be clearly seen 
today, 
to gamble on strengthening the state apparatus and the special 
services in the search for a solution to the political crisis 
does have its own logic. On the one hand, the president's 
agreement to increase budget expenditure, primarily in favor of 
the military-industrial complex, and the publication of economic 
edicts benefiting the military-industrial complex objectively 
presuppose an increased state role in the economy, and, as a 
consequence, in politics. On the other hand, the adoption by 
parliament of an inflationary budget could well lead the country 
to an extremely severe economic crisis by as early as this fall. 
And then a change of government will inevitably be required, 
with the appearance in the executive leadership of people 
capable of taking tough measures. Including state regulation of 
the economy. 
  And if you stretch out the chain of logic further, it seems 
perfectly apt that, according to trustworthy sources, on the eve 
of the publication of the edicts and the adoption of the 
decision to support increased budgetary expenditure, the 
president was visited by Yu. Skokov. A man who, as is well 
known, enjoys the reputation of being a powerful administrator 
capable of decisive actions. 
  It would appear that Yu. Skokov has fully assessed the 
statement made some time ago by S. Shakhray that it is he, 
Skokov, who is the most probable candidate to replace V. 
Chernomyrdin and is doing everything to avoid refuting the 
opinion of his former colleague in the president's team. Today 
the political standing of this leader is stronger than ever. 
Yu. Skokov has begun the formation of his own party on the 
basis of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary group and the 
Union of Commodity Producers. He also enjoys support, as far as 
is known, in the Presidential Staff. Primarily from V. 
Ilyushin, who is drawn to Yu. Skokov by many things, including 
-- to judge by a recent interview in TRUD -- an inclination 
toward "closed policy." It would appear that the president's 
chief aide has already decided for himself whose side he will be 
on in the event of B. Yeltsin's retirement from active service. 
  Today the president seems to be attempting to maneuver 
politically in an increasingly narrow space. The economic 
problems are insoluble. The military-industrial complex is a 
millstone round the country's neck. And there are no recipes on 
how to cast off this millstone while saving our head. B. 
Yeltsin's former major political support base -- the people -- 
are increasingly shying away from politics. In effect the 
president is becoming hostage to the forces on which he gambled 
last October and on whom his power rests today -- the 
bureaucracy, the power structures, and the special services.

  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin vacationing on the Black Sea will continue working 
on the second package of economic decrees which is now being 
drawn up by the government, governmental spokesman Valeriy 
Grishin said on Wednesday. 
  Grishin said that first vice-prime minister Oleg Soskovets 
will substitute for the premier for the duration of his two-week 
vacation which he will spend in the Black Sea resort city of 
Sochi. 
  The spokesman said that until the last minute it was not 
clear whether or not Chernomyrdin will take his leave now, 
mainly because of his active involvement in the work on the 
package of economic decrees aimed at continuing economic reforms 
in russia. The first package was recently signed by president 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  Grishin denied reports that Chernomyrdin would work on his 
book during his vacation. "There will be simply no time left for 
that. Besides, he needs rest too," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma deputy Boris Fedorov: "New Phase of </F>
Reforms?"] 
  [Text] Just over four months after the "pause" in the 
reforms the president has had to grasp the initiative and issue 
a number of edicts. 
  Why it is necessary to talk of a "pause" can be judged by 
the 
fact that, in March-April alone, the government issued around 
500 decrees and directives, of which not one had any direct 
bearing on economic policy. 
  The edicts on the abolition of export quotas and licenses, 
on 
the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget, and on the 
operation of virtually all sector funds through the budget can 
be called unquestionably reformist. True, all this was 
suggested a year ago, but then the resistance of sector 
lobbyists could not be overcome. With the inclusion of the 
majority of funds in the budget the field for corruption is 
considerably reduced. 
  It is indeed essential, as is envisaged in the edicts, to 
reduce profits tax and value-added tax by 10-20 percent, but the 
increase in taxes on individuals and property does not elicit 
enthusiasm. We have still not restored living standards even to 
1990's indicators, and that means that the time to increase 
citizens' taxes has not yet come. On the contrary, the middle 
class must be help to get on its feet. It is my conviction that 
proposals which are being floated to tax interest on savings and 
to tighten up the regulation of enterprise consumer funds should 
by no means be supported. 
  The president's desire to reduce the number of tax and 
customs privileges is undoubtedly correct, although at the same 
time it would not be a bad idea to determine who granted them 
and why. Export duties should have been abolished long ago. But 
the attempt to help unprofitable agriculture by reducing 
value-added tax to 10 percent is unlikely to bring tangible 
results. It is far more important economically to force 
agrarians to battle to cut costs resulting from losses. 
  In talking of the merits of the signed edicts, it is 
impossible, on the other hand, to overlook their careless 
professional and juridical elaboration. With a "live" 
parliament it is an extremely risky business to adopt decisions 
which come under its jurisdiction. Therefore the question as to 
whether standard contributions to the social security fund will 
be reduced from 1 June or whether tax privileges will be given 
to enterprises with foreign investors remains open. 
  In principle, the aforementioned decisions deserve support, 
but their legality is open to doubt. 
  The decision on the wholesale introduction of the compulsory 
universal certification of the opening of accounts, with 
numerous penalties for deviations from the new rules, cannot be 
deemed market-oriented and reformist. The authors have 
evidently forgotten that any enterprise has a balance sheet and 
accounts books. If any funds do not pass through these records, 
this is a deception of shareholders and clients. Certification 
of the opening of accounts will be of very little use in filling 
the state coffers if people are determined not to pay taxes. 
  The introduction of more stringent penalities for violation 
of tax legislation and the rules for handling cash receipts is 
undoubtedly timely. But will yet another administrative 
offensive on cash transactions help here? The impression arises 
that, instead of improving the payments system, which itself 
makes cash transactions simply unprofitable (only purely 
criminal cash transactions now take place), some people are 
reviving the old Soviet ideas of separating cash and noncash 
turnover. 
  I was surprised by the introduction by presidential edict of 
yet another new procedure for enterprises and organizations to 
use the money in their accounts. It seems that the document's 
authors are thinking only of loss-making state enterprises and 
have forgotten that there are thousands of private firms in 
Russia who are increasingly annoyed by the expanding 
bureaucratic state protection. 
  The introduction of transferable securities as a means of 
reorganizing the debts of enterprises, which was blocked after 
the president's edict of 19 October 1993, should have been 
expanded long ago. On the whole the innovations in the payments 
sphere violate the principle of the Central Bank's independence. 
In my view, this is unlawful and can lead to no good. 
  No noble purposes can justify the violation of laws, 
especially if this violation comes from the top. In my view, 
should it turn out that parliament is for any reason incapable 
of carrying out normal legislative activity, new elections 
should be held and the electoral law should be changed; but the 
Duma should not be turned into a talking shop for deputies. 
  The general impression given by this series of edicts is: 
several correct measures, several administrative exaggerations, 
and a few doubts over the legality of some of the decisions. At 
any rate, it is better than nothing.

  [Text] The end of check privatization will give the 
government the opportunity to depart fully from the present 
economically fruitless tactic of denationalization. At a recent 
meeting between [Prime Minister] Viktor Chernomyrdin and the 
heads of regional administrations, it was said that the 
government intends to share responsibility for changing the 
tactics of reform with regions which have not yet even defined 
their attitude to it.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker report in the "Projects" column: "Boris </F>
Fedorov Has Appealed to Boris Yeltsin. The Ex-Minister Proposed 
to Use the Law to Protect Consumers' Rights in the Sphere of 
Financial Services"] 
  [Text] The recently proliferating "instances of collapse 
and outright fraud on the part of such financial establishments 
as the Independent Oil Concern, Fisko, and Impulsinvest" has 
prompted State Duma subcommittee chairman Boris Fedorov to turn 
to Boris Yeltsin. The former finance minister drew the 
president's attention to the fact that apart from material 
losses, thousands of defrauded citizens are losing trust in the 
reforms and the policy pursued by the head of state. 
  The emergence and collapse of "scam" companies is the result 
of weak legislative regulation; moreover, state bodies, in Mr. 
Fedorov's opinion, have shunned decisive action. This situation 
is used by the media, spreading advertisements for a multitude 
of dubious firms. 
  Invoking his right to initiate legislation, deputy Fedorov 
officially submitted to the State Duma a draft law On Protecting 
Consumers' Rights in the Sphere of Financial Services. The 
author subsumes under the category of financial services 
soliciting deposits, conclusion of contracts on any forms of 
monetary fund management, and any form of mediation in 
securities operations. Said services may be provided both in the 
Russian national currency and in foreign exchange. These 
services may be provided only based on a license issued by the 
Central Bank, the Finance Ministry, or another regulating body. 
  To make sure that the consumer does not make a blind choice, 
an article in Fedorov's draft obligates the provider of 
financial services to present all the relevant information, an 
unambiguous description of his services, and the actual interest 
rate on income or fixed dividend at an annual rate, if such is 
guaranteed. For its part the Central Bank and government 
institutions, in order to curb the activity of bogus firms, 
shall verify, on requests from private citizens or corporate 
entities, the authenticity of financial services offered by 
their organizers. 
  The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry must regularly 
publish both "black" and "white" lists of firms that have 
received licenses and forfeited the right to operate on the 
financial services market. "Violators of the convention" are to 
be fined to the extent of 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage. 
Punishment is also to be apportioned to directors of media 
outlets that have advertised subsequently banned firms providing 
such "services." The fine, however, is envisioned at only half 
the above rate. It is extremely important that "in the event 
that the activity by an organization offering financial services 
is suspended...the body responsible for this decision...be 
obliged to take all possible measures to protect the impounded 
funds, including from inflation...by temporarily investing them 
in reliable and sufficiently profitable financial market 
instruments." 
  Noting that its passage through the Duma can drag out, Boris 
Fedorov asked Boris Yeltsin to use this draft in preparing a 
corresponding presidential edict.

  [Text] The Russian government will not impose mutual debt 
cancellation on factories even though overdue debts have grown 
in April in both quantitative and qualitative terms, Deputy 
Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said. He told the Federation 
Council that this would be inflationary. 
  According to Shokhin, the budget revenue was eight trillion 
rubles short of the target in the first four months of the year. 
The debts to banks amounted to 6.5 trillion rubles, to the 
suppliers, 23 trillion rubles and to the customers, 28 trillion 
rubles in the first quarter of 1994. 
  Shokhin said that reducing the inflation rate, which has 
ranged between eight and nine percent a month, and issue of 
treasury bills to pay 800 billion rubles of the state debt to 
factories were the priority steps in resolving the debt crisis. 
  He added that the government would continue centralized 
crediting of factories; in particular, the Central Bank had 
allocated four trillion rubles for that purpose. 
  Shokhin promised that the government would follow through on 
the procedure of declaring insolvent factories bankrupt. Twelve 
factories out of more than 1000 are under close scrutiny the 
results of which will be discussed by the government in 
mid-June, he said.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Khudyakova report: "Number of Unemployed Grows </F>
Slowly but Surely"] 
  [Text] As of 1 May the State Employment Service had 
1,459,000,000 citizens registered as not having a job [ne 
imeyushchiy raboty], of whom 1.18 million were acknowledged as 
unemployed [bezrabotnyy]. April saw almost 100,000 people 
deprived of a livelihood "signing on" at the labor exchanges. 
The unemployment level for Russia as a whole stands at 1.4 
percent. 
  There are not many vacancies -- 325,000 jobs in all, of 
which 
83 percent are intended for workers and only 17 percent for 
employees. The number of applicants per post, namely four 
people not in regular work [nezanyatyy] and three unemployed 
people for each one, gives an idea of the scale of the problem. 
However, there are regions where jobs are like gold dust. In 
terms of applicants per vacancy there are 255 in the Ingush 
Republic, 51 in Ivanovo Oblast, and 31-35 citizens without 
regular work in Dagestan and Chuvashia. 
  Only 285,000 Rusians have been able to obtain work this year 
through the employment service, and their number also includes 
those who were able to receive vocational training and 
retraining. 
  There has been a slight increase in the number of people who 
have fixed themselves up with public works jobs and improved, 
albeit temporarily, their material position -- they number 
38,000 since the start of the year. 
  The Russian Federation Government Center for Monitoring 
Economic Conditions has prepared on the basis of the employment 
services' data a short-term forecast of the situation in the 
labor market in terms of Russia as a whole and individual 
regions covering the next few months. It is expected that May's 
unemployment figure will reach 1,284,000,000, June's will 
increase by roughly another 100,000, while July's will reach 
1.52 million. The unemployment level by mid-summer will reach 
1.7 million. 
  The highest rate of increase in the number of unemployed 
people continues to occur in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, 
Pskov, and Vladimir Oblasts; the lowest rate of increase is in 
Tatarstan, Yakutia, Smolensk and Belgorod Oblasts, and Moscow 
city.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Economics" column: "The </F>
Government and the Central Bank Have Taken a Hand in the Edicts. 
Shokhin Does Not Care for Glazyev's Position"] 
  [Text] Yesterday two news conferences on economic policy 
at the level of top government officials were held in Moscow. 
First Viktor Gerashchenko met with journalists in the Central 
Bank on the occasion of State Bank Day (old style). In the 
White House [Vice Premier] Aleksandr Shokhin, in the company of 
Deputy Finance Ministers Aleksashenko and Kazmin; Tax Service 
chief Vladimir Gusev; and Mr. Gerashchenko, who arrived 
hurriedly in his Zil limousine straight from the Central Bank, 
at 1210 began to take questions from the newsmen. 
  In the White House, several subjects were discussed, the 
most 
urgent among which was the extent of the government's 
involvement in drafting presidential edicts. Shokhin stated 
that its participation has been more than substantial, stressing 
that in the future the cabinet will be more actively promoting 
its work because otherwise "others will do so." The edicts 
themselves, according to Shokhin, were the result of a six-hour 
meeting between the president and the premier. Commenting on 
the edicts, Shokhin confirmed the need to spell out the foreign 
policy edict with government resolutions. According to him, the 
edict's interpretation is so far being drafted within the 
framework of one document, but if it becomes impossible to 
incorporate the commentaries in one, several resolutions will 
then be issued on the subject. Viktor Gerashchenko, commenting 
on the Central Bank's participation in drafting the edicts, 
stated that it has been considerable, denying media reports 
about his opposition. At the same time, according to him, at 
the final stage of drafting the first package some deplorable 
inconsistencies had slipped into the edicts. More specifically, 
Viktor Gerashchenko said that permission to withdraw sums from 
deposit accounts before term as a way to overcome the 
nonpayments problem could seriously harm the banking system. 
  Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, at journalists' 
request, expressed the Finance Ministry's opinion on the 
development of inflationary processes. According to him, the 
decisions made will not lead to a growth in inflation before the 
end of summer; it will stay at the May level of 7-9 percent, and 
in December it could fall to 5 percent provided the current 
anti-inflation policy continues and there are no serious 
incidents. Unemployment growth, according to Finance Ministry 
predictions, will continue to creep. 
  Shokhin also commented on the battle around the budget in 
the 
State Duma. He fully rejects the position of Sergey Glazyev, 
who heads the Duma's Economic Policy Committee and proposes 
respectively to add 30 trillion rubles in revenues and 
expenditures into the budget. In his opinion, Glazyev's 
position is counterproductive: The revenues he counts on are 
hypothetical. And this means that should there be a shortage, 
the government will have to sequester expenditures. Aleksandr 
Shokhin has no doubt that as a result, this will affect not the 
lobbyists -- who "will get what they want anyway" -- but the 
social sphere and education. Shokhin relates more favorably to 
the position by budget committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov who, 
according to the vice premier, is ready to draw up a 
"mini-budget" with possible additional revenues: Under the 
project, the first three trillion of "surplus" money will go to 
the military industrial complex; the next, to the social sphere, 
and so forth. 
  Shokhin also spoke about the results of a government 
delegation's visit to China where possibilities of interstate 
long- term investment cooperation were considered. In 
particular this included the construction of five thermal power 
stations, talks about which have been going on for a long time; 
a bid for the construction of a hydro-power station on the 
Yangtze river, where Russia has good chances for success; and 
also the problem of mutual payments. On the latter question the 
Chinese side, according to the vice premier, has not as yet 
granted Russian trading companies access to the national 
currency, the yuan, but included a proposal in corresponding 
protocols on recognizing trading firms' right to choose their 
intermediaries. This should expedite the solution of the 
problem of quality and mix of goods, even if supplied by a 
limited number of trading agents. Shokhin believes that Russia 
can use the experience of Chinese free economic zones in the 
Maritime region and in the Baltics. 
  Both news conferences discussed lifting restrictions on 
foreign bank activity in Russia. Speaking at the Central Bank, 
Gerashchenko stated that "today work is under way on new `rules 
of the game' for foreign banks in Russia. The Central Bank has 
a deadline -- 8 June -- before which time a law has to be 
drafted." Aleksandr Shokhin, speaking in the White House, said 
that an agreement with the European Council could be signed on 
13 June because the uranium issue has already been resolved. 
According to him, restrictions on foreign banks are to be 
gradually lifted (within three to five years). According to 
Gerashchenko (speaking at the Central Bank), there is still a 
limitation on foreign banks' aggregate share in Russia's banking 
capital -- 12 percent. "The size of the limit itself, however 
-- 10 percent or 15 percent -- is not of a matter of principle," 
the Central Bank chairman stated.

<F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- President of the Association 
of Russian Banks Sergey Yegorov went on record today for a "time 
out" in the admission of foreign banks to the Russian market. 
  "In principle," he told a press conference here, "we favour 
foreign investments in the Russian economy, including the 
banking sphere. However, the national banking system is yet in 
the making. It is not strong enough to face tough competition 
from major foreign banks on the domestic market. Hence, there 
is no point in trying to `butt the oak'. We need time to gather 
strength." 
  Yegorov noted that Russian banks ran up against great 
difficulties whenever they tried to open their offices, let 
alone subsidiaries, in Western countries. 
  "Restrictions on the admission of foreign banks to the 
Russian market," he said, "will not last for centuries, but only 
for concrete time periods, necessary to give the Russian 
commercial banks a breather so that they could gather strength 
and build up a Russian national banking system." 
  Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Chairman of 
the Russian Central Bank Viktor Gerashchenko said that some 
restrictions on the work of foreign banks in Russia might be 
lifted in the foreseeable future.

  [Text] For the second day running, miners at the 
Vostsibugol joint stock company -- which operates on the 
territory of three rayons of Irkutsk, Chita Oblasts, and the 
Republic of Buryatiya -- have not been dispatching fuel for 
consumers. According to a statement by Vladimir Solomin, 
chairman of the company's strike committee, an exception has 
only been made with regard to the petrochemical workers of 
Angarsk, who have fully settled their accounts for the output 
received. The remaining consumers situated in the region are 
considered to be debtors, as are those in neighboring Khabarovsk 
and Maritime Krays. 
  According to a statement by General Director Ivan Shchadov, 
Vostsibugol is the largest mining company in Russia today, which 
is capable of producing 32 million tonnes of fuel annually, but 
on one condition, that it receives its wages on time. At the 
moment the debts to the miners amount to 170 billion rubles, and 
they are prepared to make their actions open-ended. The 
administration of Irkutsk Oblast, where the main enterprises of 
the joint stock company are situated, considers the action of 
the miners to be illegal and has demanded the dispatch of coal 
to consumers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Economics" rubric: "The </F>
Wages of Workers in Budget-Funded Sectors Should Grow If the 
Budget Income Grows, Russian Federation Labor Minister Gennadiy 
Melikyan Believes"] 
  [Text] Many government lances have already been broken on 
the question of the indexation of the minimum wage. No one 
seriously objects to it in principle. Both the president and 
the prime minister have repeatedly stated that the main aim of 
economic reform as a whole is to improve people's lives, but 
without scrupulous calculations and long-term forecasting of the 
social consequences of the government's actions, no serious 
decisions can be made. 
  That is why I propose that we should look at the problem of 
indexation more closely. An increase in the minimum wage in the 
country to 19,000 rubles [R] will immediately be reflected in a 
corresponding growth in all social payments. And this means 
subsidies, pensions, and compensation. The main point is that 
the payment of the first category under the Single Tariff Scheme 
in budget-funded sectors of the economy will definitely change. 
  In this case I am not so much worried about a possible spurt 
in inflation as by the practical problems of budgets at various 
levels. We know that today workers in budget-funded sectors are 
80-percent funded out of local treasuries. Will regional 
budgets be able to provide another wage increase to their 
teachers and doctors if the government adopts this decision? I 
think it unlikely. Indeed, my latest trips around the country 
have convinced me that, with an inflation rate that has slowed 
down, people are demanding not so much the indexation of wages 
as their payment on time. 
  To my mind, it would be more reasonable to elaborate a 
system 
of clear-cut recommendations on which local authorities could 
base independent decisions on increasing wages to their 
budget-funded workers. In that case, their decisions would be 
based on real financial possibilities and therefore would be of 
a practical nature rather than being on paper only.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yermolin article: "Search for 18 Trillion Rubles </F>
Continues. Not Only for Army -- for Country's Security"] 
  [Text] Today, according to the agenda approved Wednesday 
[25 May], the State Duma will continue its work on the draft law 
"On the Federal Budget for 1994." Discussion of defense items 
will take place behind closed doors. 
  I do not think there is any need to explain why "closed 
doors" were necessary. "We will try to convince the deputies," 
I was told by Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma 
Defense Committee, "that 55 trillion rubles [R] is the minimum 
defense expenditure below which we cannot go." The discussion 
will proceed with specific figures to hand and with Defense 
Ministry computations -- where particular sums are going and 
what they are for. Yushenkov believes it is largely the 
detailed argument which could sway those who voted 11 May 
against increasing military expenditure. 
  But let us stipulate immediately that the "anti-Army" 
motives 
are by no means homogeneous here. There are, of course, those 
deputies who by virtue of their professional detachment from 
defense problems are more inclined to believe the expert 
authorities. If the government says R37 trillion is enough to 
cover defense expenditure, is it not best to believe it? 
Especially as, instead of a well reasoned project, during the 
first reading the deputies were offered, as they say, just "the 
bare figures." It is for the sake of this category of doubters 
that it it is possible and necessary to try to interpret where 
and how the military intend to spend the people's money. But I 
fear that for a certain number of deputies nothing can be proved 
-- some, having sworn loyalty to their own departmenbt, will not 
give up a single kopek, others will be inflexible because the 
proposal arises from "politically alien elements," still others 
will be guided by subtle and political considerations calculated 
many moves in advance. Any reasoning is poweless here. 
  Yes, our deputies come in many varieties. But let us recall 
that a majority -- 166 people -- nonetheless voted for the 
allocation of the R18 trillion sought. Let us also bear in mind 
that it was in the Duma that this amendment to the government's 
draft law arose. And it was the Defenmse Committee and the 
Defense Ministry which initiated the meeting with the Russian 
Federation president's assistant for security, which ultimately 
led to the president's intervention, who recognized the 
correctness of increasing the defense budget to R55 trillion. 
Today, when battle will again be joined for a realistic amount 
of military expenditure, I know there will be many defenders of 
the Army to be found in the State Duma hall. But the discussion 
will not be about defending the Army on a grand scale but about 
the state's security. It is not at all obligatory that somebody 
should attack us from outside -- the collapse of the Army and 
defense industry will shake the country worse than aggression 
would. 
  What is actually going on? Everyone realizes -- even the 
Finance Ministry and Central Bank -- that the military is not 
asking for anything excessive. And this is stated by the person 
who bears chief responsibility for the state's defense 
capability -- Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin. But 
the question of the additional R18 trillion remains up in the 
air. 
  It is the easiest thing in the world to look for plotters, 
especially across the ocean. But here it is better to agree 
with Yushenkov's deputy -- Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov: The root 
of evil lies in our negligence, in the inability to see further 
than our own noses. Economizing on the Army and the defense 
industry today means to lose those same trillions tomorrow, only 
multiplied 10-fold. Piskunov off the cuff offered a scenario 
for the development of the situation if there were just the 
paltry R37 trillion. I issue a defense order, but the state is 
not giving enterprises the money. So directors take out bank 
loans (naturally at commercial banks -- there are no others) at 
extortionate interest rates. The order is fulfilled but, in 
order to pay the banks back they accordingly increase the price 
of their output. Thus, domestically-produced combat equipment 
and weapons will turn out so expensive that it will be more 
advantageous to buy weapons and equipment abroad. "Specialists" 
in the field of foreign trade will be found who will readily 
substantiate the need for the final collapse of the Russian 
defense industry, citing as substantiation none other than the 
state's interests. It is easy to miss all this in one's 
calculations today -- like the losses from the impossibility of 
advantageously trading arms on the world market. But for some, 
as Piskunov said, there is an insurmountable temptation to pay 
"for the financial system's inefficiency with the collapse of 
effective defense." 
  The budget deficit must not be increased. The consequences 
of this step are also easy to miss when calculating. Meanwhile, 
the inflationary noose, which will inevitably be pulled tighter 
after a new batch of money backed by nothing is printed (the 
same R18 trillion), and it will take a mortal grip on the throat 
of the military man, above all. Whereas other people, even 
those working in the budget-financed sector but civilians 
nonetheless, have the opportunity to do a bit of extra work 
somewhere to supplement their family budget, the military man is 
completely deprived of this opportunity. This is why, Yushenkov 
tried to convince me, when "Russia's Choice" categorically comes 
out against increasing the budget deficit, it is not least 
defending the interests of military personnel themselves. What 
is the solution? Yushenkov (let me remind you that he is a 
"Russia's Choice" activist) belives that it is possible to 
scrape together the required sum by reassessing sources of the 
income element of the budget. Incidentally, the State Duma 
Economic Policy Committee has specific proposals on this. 
Specifically, committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev is proposing 
refusing a number of privileges to structures trading abroad 
(the estimated saving is between R5 trillion and R10 trillion), 
and to make privatization more "lucrative." Sergey Yushenkov is 
counting on income from foreign economic activity and reducing 
the state apparatus, and is not ruling out the possibility of 
efficiently raising a domestic targeted loan from both citizens 
and commercial structures. Aleksandr Piskunov sees some 
unexploited poitential in tax policy but chiefly in the taxation 
practice. (The state just cannot learn how to collect taxes). 
There are also other proposals. The main thing, Piskunov said, 
is that during the second reading there should be no clash 
between conceptual economic schools. Putting it simply, our 
learned economists should not lapse into arrogance. There is 
one further hope that government representatives too will come 
along to today's session with specific options for resolving 
this difficult situation. Only not with those which will cause 
the military to clash head-on with, for instance, the farmers, 
the scientists, the medical personnel, or the whole world in 
general. So that some time later you would have to explain to 
the people: You will have to wait this year for an increase in 
wages and pensions -- you yourselves are aware that the Army's 
demands have had to be met. 
  Nonetheless, let us hope that the state will provide a 
subsistence minimum for its Armed Forces, however hard it is to 
do so. But it is woth bearing in mind for the future that 
Russians are also giving us money today for real reforms in the 
Army. They, our reforms, do not come cheap. But the route 
which they are now to take is dependent on what kind of defense 
budget for 1995 the State Duma deputies will vote tomorrow, and 
with what kind of enthusiasm they vote. 
  It is the easiest thing in the world to look for plotters, 
especially across the ocean. But here it is better to agree 
with Yushenkov's deputy -- Deputy Aleksandr Piskunov: The root

  [Text] Russia's Defence Ministry incurred a debt of 6 
trillion rubles to munitions producers and army personnel over 
the first five months of the year. As a senior ministry 
official told Interfax on Wednesday, the department was 
underpaid 4.9 trillion rubles out of the federal budget. 
  In his words, the army has turned into a large debtor. There 
have been more and more conflicts when due to debt problems 
bakeries have denied bread to army units and municipalities have 
threatened to stop electricity supply. The military, he noted, 
have been trying to prevent this by exerting pressure on local 
officials with tanks and otherwise. He had in mind cases when 
the command of a unit sent military vehicles to local government 
premises to bully officials there. 
  He doubts that the 37.1 trillion ruble budget, endorsed by 
the Duma after the first hearing, will help to reform the armed 
forces and bring Russian troops back home. 
  "Those who insist on that figure, are energetically pushing 
the army to the line beyond which there come irreversible 
consequences, catastrophe and chaos", the official declared. 
Nor, in his view, could the 55 trillion ruble military budget 
supported by President Yeltsin solve all the problems facing the 
armed forces, even though it would help to keep the country's 
defence potential intact. 
  He disclosed that the commander of an army platoon got a 
meagre monthly pay of 200,000 rubles (about 100 dollars). The 
pilot of a supersonic military jet earns 440 thousand rubles 
(220 dollars), whereas his civilian counterpart makes more than 
1.5 million rubles (1500 dollars).

  [Text] Vladivostok June 2 TASS -- "Only outright 
ill-wishers, who have no sense of patriotism, can relish the 
current temporary setbacks of the Russian Navy," First Assistant 
Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral Igor Kasatonov, 
who is currently visiting the maritime territory of the Russian 
Far East, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The admiral has spent two weeks visiting Navy garrisons, 
ammunition depots and storages. "Yes," the admiral said, "there 
are some shortcomings and blunders, but order is being restored 
with an iron hand. Many problems could be resolved if our 
efforts were backed by normal financing." 
  Touching on the efforts to do away with the consequences of 
the latest explosion of a naval aviation depot, the admiral 
noted that seven sapper teams, an obstacle clearing team, six 
military vehicles, including engineering machinery, are now 
working in the state of emergency zone. As many as 32.4 square 
kilometres of territory have already been checked. More than 
900 shells and bombs were discovered. About 200 of them were 
blown up. 
  "In spite of all the bitter setbacks," Kasatonov believes, 
"the Russian Pacific Fleet is still a solid and strong 
organisational entity and it will surely remain a guarantor of 
the safety of Russian sea borders in the Pacific Ocean."

<F P=106> [Vitaliy Cherkasov report: "Cossack Draft...After 75 Years"] </F>
  [Text] Volgograd -- In accordance with an order by Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and a General Staff directive the 
drafting of new recruits into our Army's Cossack units has 
begun. In all the re-created Cossack troop districts -- the Don, 
Astrakhan, Volga, Kuban, Terek, Orenburg, Amur, Ussuri, Yenisey, 
Irkutsk, Transbaykal, and Siberian districts -- lists of young 
boys who will serve in their own Cossack details, divisions, and 
battalions as well as protecting the border, have been handed 
over to the military commissariats. 
  Clearly, following the 75-year-long enforced disbandment of 
the Cossacks, it is hard to organize new combat-ready units. 
There are also a lot of other problems which Vladimir Naumov, 
field ataman of the Council of Russian Cossacks, spoke about in 
an interview which he gave in Volgograd. 
  "All our proposals concerning the organization of the first 
Cossack draft were accepted by the military department, approved 
by Minister Grachev, and submitted to the State Duma Committee 
for Matters of Defense and Security. Unfortunately, I cannot 
say when this question will be examined by deputies. Time is 
passing, the spring sowing is ending, but the hearing of the 
question keeps being delayed. 
  "Taking the Cossacks' wishes into account, the military 
department approved the uniform which the Cossacks had in 1914 
-- khaki soldier's shirts and pants made of blue cloth with 
stripes in the traditional colors for Cossack troops -- crimson 
for the Don, yellow for Astrakhan, and so on. Sleeve chevrons 
will also be introduced. 
  "The Ministry of Defense is examining whether commanders of 
Cossack details and battalions should be Cossack officers from 
the same areas as the new recruits. For this reason, the 
recruitment of students from Cossack regions to the military 
schools is being announced. Naturally, `The History of the 
Cossacks' must be an indispensable educational discipline in 
these training institutes. 
  "If they are really going to be organized, why should the 
Cossack regiments not be given back the names which they bore 
before the Revolution? For instance, the Don regiment named for 
Ataman Platov, or the Yermak Timofeyevich regiment. This would 
discipline the young Cossacks, cement their ranks, and make them 
honor the traditions of their ancestors. The fact that 
information to the effect that a draftee is a Cossack can be put 
into his military registration documents at his own wish is a 
source of joy to the Cossack. In that case, the entry 
`Cossack' will be made in the `Special Notes' section." 
  Aleksandr Kotenkov, Russian Federation deputy minister for 
nationalities affairs and regional policy, comments on the 
report by our Volgograd correspondent: 
  "It is true that the spring draft for the Army in Russia's 
Cossack regions has been announced, but, within the framework of 
existing legislation, it has been on general principles. There 
is no specific Cossack form of recruitment for military units or 
large units, as the law on Cossack military service has not been 
adopted yet. 
  "The elaboration of a draft law to this effect is currently 
being concluded in our ministry, and it will be submitted to the 
Russian Government for agreement and conclusion next week. 
  "With the adoption of this document, the formation of 
Cossack 
units will really develop. The Cossack servicemen's full dress 
will be traditional, depending on which Cossack group they 
belong to, and the everyday uniform will remain the same as it 
is in the entire Russian Army. This is natural. It is hard to 
imagine a member of the tank crew, for example, in a Circassian 
coat and Astrakhan hat and with a dagger. 
  "It is no secret that today the Army draft is proceeding 
with 
difficulty for a whole number of reasons. But, according to our 
calculations, with the introduction of the Cossack model for 
forming military units, the number of draftees in Cossack 
regions will increase at least tenfold."

<F P=106> [Interview with General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief </F>
of Border Guards, by Igor Chernyak; place and date not given: 
"`Barbed Wire' Will Remain in the Past. Border Guards Commander 
in Chief Andrey Nikolayev Intends To Bring About a Revolution on 
the Border"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The kind of respect shown by 
subordinates to their leader Nikolayev is rarely encountered 
these days. Border Guards officers have the following to say 
about their 45-year-old commander in chief: "His first 
statement on taking up his post was: `I will not tolerate 
rudeness by senior ranks to subordinates.' During the past year 
he has not once raised his voice against his subordinates. The 
ability to talk tough without destroying the human element in a 
man is a rare quality among generals." 
  [Nikolayev] I inherited my poor eyesight from my mother. 
When I speak about my father, I cannot fail to mention her as 
well. My mother was a graduate of the Literature Institute; she 
wrote poetry and left several notebooks of wonderful lyric 
poems. These poems trace the progress of my father's career and 
my own. Thanks to my mother we were from childhood surrounded by 
wonderful people -- Soloukhin, Rozhdestvenskiy, and aunt Lyuda 
Kasatkina were close friends of my mother's, as was uncle 
Serezha Kolosov -- do you know the film "Drawing Fire"? My 
father, however, was surrounded by military men, so we had a 
wide circle of acquaintances. 
  [Chernyak] Have you lived all your life in Moscow? 
  [Nikolayev] While I have been a soldier my family has moved 
14 times. I started out as a platoon commander, then moved up 
through a company, regiment, and division, and before being 
transferred to the General Staff I commanded an army. 
  [Chernyak] Andrey Ivanovich, increasingly we hear people say 
that when you left to join the Border Guards you took the best 
remaining General Staff cadres along with you and created what 
amounted to your own mini-General Staff with its own Central 
Command Post. A number of military experts acknowledge that all 
this has had a positive impact on the controllability of the 
troops entrusted to you, joking that your former colleagues from 
the Arbat may soon be coming to see you for experience.... 
  [Nikolayev] I can give you figures relating to the number of 
people who came to our apparatus from the Ministry of Defense 
and the General Staff, and I can assure you that the numbers 
were small. During the time I worked on the General Staff I 
developed the deepest respect for that structure. If someone 
leaves it for reasons of redundancy, age, or whatever, we are 
always prepared to offer them a position, especially as people 
work five years longer here than in the Army. By helping these 
people who have the highest professional training we are 
primarily keeping them for the state. However, both the 
Ministry of Defense and the Border Guards are working for a 
common cause, so I see no problems about this. I hardly need 
say that the General Staff is not someone's personal fiefdom but 
a place where the cream of the Armed Forces is gathered 
together, and it is no surprise that, when people leave the 
General Staff to work for us, they bring their ideas with them. 
  [Chernyak] The newspapers have recently been flashing 
reports that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov allegedly 
announced at a closed session of the State Duma that the 
Ministry of Defense is prepared, "if the government so decides," 
to transfer Navy and some Airborne Troops forces to the control 
of the Border Guards with a view to establishing mobile forces. 
But are you ready to receive them? 
  [Nikolayev] I think that you should ask Mikhail Petrovich 
himself to comment on this. As far as the Border Guards are 
concerned, we have our own niche; the Navy and the Airborne 
Troops do not fall within our remit; they have enough work of 
their own. 
  [Chernyak] The idea of separating the functions of the 
Ministry of Defense and General Staff is being widely touted. 
What is your opinion of this as a former General Staff officer? 
  [Nikolayev] Briefly, I would say that life has shown us that 
the General Staff should evolve into something else, that its 
functions should have been reexamined long ago with a view to 
expanding its role. An Armed Forces General Staff is necessary, 
but the General Staff is not the Ministry of Defense. 
  [Chernyak] What is your attitude to the military reforms 
being pursued by the Ministry of Defense? 
  [Nikolayev] No system can reform itself through its own 
efforts. In our country, however, the Army has been entrusted 
with this task. The result is natural. 
  [Chernyak] The issue of Russia's joining the "Partnership 
for Peace" program is so complex that even Minister Grachev has 
changed his viewpoint on this matter several times over the past 
month. What do you think of the expediency of rapprochement with 
NATO? 
  [Nikolayev] Russia should have special status -- I am 
convinced of this. After all, cooperation necessarily entails 
concessions. [Nikolayev ends] 
  Further comments by officers about their commander in chief: 
"A military intellectual in the true sense of the word." "A 
new wave has arrived with him which will not only renew the 
cadre composition of the High Command but will also encourage 
the idea of switching to a more civilized procedure for guarding 
the border." 
  [Chernyak] Andrey Ivanovich, not so long ago Boris Yeltsin 
made you a member of the Russian Federation Security Council. 
We have become accustomed to seeing Grachev, Yerin, or the 
state security chief on the Council, but this is the first time 
the chief border guard has been given a place. When you 
attended the first sessions, did you not feel a bit like an 
extra? 
  [Nikolayev] If we regard the state border purely in terms of 
the Border Guards, their commander in chief really has nothing 
to do on the Security Council. But you can look at it another 
way. I often come to work in "civvies," and what is more I do 
so deliberately. I try in whatever way I can to stress that in 
two or three or five years' time the Federal Border Service -- 
the Border Guards High Command -- is scheduled to become a 
service without a High Command: We began as soldiers, and we 
will complete our journey as an ordinary federal service. 
Guarding the state border is primarily a political matter. 
  [Chernyak] What, your stated aim is to disband the Border 
Guards? 
  [Nikolayev] That is not what I am saying: The role of the 
border service as a structure coordinating the activity of the 
departments working on the state border -- the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, 
the Customs Committee, the immigration service, and others -- 
will expand, whereas the role of the military guard will shrink. 
We cannot of course entirely discard the military system of 
guarding the border. But we need to understand that nowadays 
this is no longer the basis for ensuring the security of the 
state's borders. After all, what image of the state border have 
we become accustomed to? Barbed wire, soldiers, dogs, "Halt, 
who goes there?" These days nobody needs this kind of state 
border. If we try to reestablish this kind of border, first of 
all people will tear it down, and second, we will lose not only 
our shirts but our underwear as well. For example, the length 
of Russia's border with Kazakhstan is 7,559 km. One kilometer 
costs 1 billion rubles. Merely to build the border itself -- 
without any infrastructure, housing, and so forth -- we would 
require 7.6 trillion, which is 150 percent more than all our 
current expenditure on maintaining the Border Guards. And what 
would the point of all that expenditure be? 
  We are making it our task to achieve cooperation with 
neighboring states for the purposes of combating criminal groups 
and preventing smuggling and illegal immigration. The border is 
both a sanitary checkpoint and a limit where we can confront 
forces engaging in intelligence activity. At the same time it 
should not be closed, and under no circumstances should it act 
as a barrier to goods, let alone people. Look: Approximately 2 
million people used to cross the USSR's borders [period not 
specified] on the way out of the country; nowadays 43 million 
people are entering the Russian Federation alone, and across the 
CIS as a whole the figure is approximately 200 million. Such 
border crossings are becoming the norm, because any law-abiding 
person quietly crosses the border at the designated crossing 
points. We only need to combat those who violate the procedure. 
I hope to see the day when the number of violations is reduced 
to a minimum: Not because we have started working more 
effectively, but simply because people realize that you do not 
have to resort to a violation in order to cross the border -- it 
is no longer the old-style border. We need to change people's 
psychology, but unfortunately this cannot be done overnight. 
  [Chernyak] What is your ideal state border? 
  [Nikolayev] Once, when I still had no idea of becoming a 
border guard, I was traveling in the vicinity of the 
U.S.-Canadian border; you only need a driver's license to cross 
it. But we should not look for the ideal as it exists in other 
countries. We should take a look to see which is best, but 
there is no need to copy it exactly. 
  [Chernyak] Do you intend to build a border with Ukraine? 
  [Nikolayev] In my view, Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], and 
Russia are a single people living in three independent states. 
But sovereignty is not a fence, even though many people may 
think so, taking the view that once you become a sovereign state 
you necessarily have to fence yourself off. The Belorussians 
were the first in the CIS to ensure Russia's interests on their 
borders -- we have mutual commitments, and also the right to 
carry out checks. We would like to build similar relations with 
Ukraine. If things work out, the border between our two 
countries will merely comprise border controls -- not five-km 
zones with border posts and troops -- and there will simply be 
checkpoints on the roads manned jointly by Russians and 
Ukrainians. This sort of border unites rather than divides. 
Sometimes we have to overcome opposition from people with 
antiquated views: They say that this has never been done on any 
state border. Well, so what? We will do it now. There is no 
formation quite like the CIS in the world either. 
  [Chernyak] How do you see the borders between the CIS and 
Central Asia developing in the future? 
  [Nikolayev] Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Tajikistan, 
and Turkmenia are currently establishing their own border 
guards, and their role in guarding the border will increase. In 
the longer term, however, it would be expedient for Russia to 
have an operations group in the area which, besides 
participating in guarding CIS borders, will check that the 
commitments agreed to by these states are met. At present we 
pay half the cost of guarding these borders, but in the future 
we hope to reduce our share of the expenditure to nil: The 
interests of the Central Asian republics are being protected by 
Russia on the borders stretching from the Far East to Poland, 
and that is our contribution. 
  [Chernyak] Not so long ago you announced that the Border 
Guards have 58 generals -- an order of magnitude lower than than 
in the Army in proportion to the number of officers and enlisted 
men. Is this a deliberate policy? And what is your attitude to 
the abundance of generalships that are being awarded? 
  [Nikolayev] I am not happy with the word "abundance" in this 
context. We currently have 75 generals, and following the 
completion of the current stage of organizational development of 
the Border Guards we plan to have 145 generals' and admirals' 
posts -- new structures and Border Guards groups are being 
formed. Basically, the ratio of one general to 1,700-1,800 men 
seems fine to me, and the Ministry of Defense and internal 
troops, incidentally, have slightly fewer. The problem is 
something else entirely: We have a very large number of 
generals at the center, and also a great many people who have 
nothing to do with this rank, such as the chief military 
gynecologist. In my view, we should proceed first and foremost 
from a calculation of many people we actually need. [Nikolayev 
ends] 
  Further comments by officers about their commander in chief: 
"After reading an article in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS criticizing 
the Border Guards in connection with the events on Tanfilyev 
Island, the commander made the following resolution on the 
matter: 'It is terribly upsetting, but everyone must face the 
truth.' He dislikes misrepresentation of facts, but he is not 
afraid of the truth." 
  [Chernyak] The Border Guards have always compared favorably 
with the Army -- primarily with regard to the atmosphere at 
border posts and the absence of bullying. Suddenly we are 
hearing reports to the contrary, and the Border Guards are 
virtually being portrayed as the chief offenders.... 
  [Nikolayev] Yes, discipline is on the wane, and this worries 
me a great deal. This year alone the number of irregular 
relationships has increased by over 150 percent compared to 
1993. Nevertheless I cannot agree with your premise that we are 
"leading the field." Besides, let us look at the heart of the 
problem. The crime situation in the country is getting worse 
and worse, and the Border Guards cannot remain in a vacuum. The 
Border Guards used not to accept draftees who had been arrested 
even once by the militia. Could we do that now? 
  [Chernyak] A number of rumors are circulating about the 
mysterious death in Tajikistan of Colonel Aleshinskiy of the 
High Command. Do you have any new information or alternative 
versions of the reasons for the tragedy? 
  [Nikolayev] This incident is unpleasant and difficult for 
the Border Guards. A suicide has taken place. As a specialist 
Aleshinskiy was a sensible and professionally trained officer. 
But unfortunately you do meet people in the military who have 
an alcohol dependency problem. 
  [Chernyak] Was the Far East "Putina-94" operation your idea? 
  [Nikolayev] Operations of this type will soon be put into 
effect on all Russia's seas. Everyone is keen to know whose 
idea it was. Write down that the president dreamed it up (he 
laughs). Basically, however, we have proposed something that has 
been in the air for a long time, and Boris Nikolayevich has 
backed us. After two-and-a-half years of lethargy, we need to 
begin rebuilding our national dignity. "Putina" is designed to 
let the people know that we have everything we need to defend 
our national dignity: the political will in the leadership, 
people who can make it happen -- talented, intelligent, and 
capable people -- and the necessary resources, provided that we 
do not squander them or sell them off right, left, and center. 
After all, we are not a nation in decline; we are great Russia.

  [Text] The State Duma leaders have refused to increase 
budget spending on defense by 18 trillion rubles (from 37 
trillion to 55 trillion rubles - Interfax), Vice Premier 
Alexander Shokhin told Interfax. 
  He told the Federation Council on Wednesday that during a 
conference on May 31, attended by Cabinet members, the State 
Duma leaders turned down a corresponding proposal by the State 
Duma's Committee for Economic Policies, chaired by Sergey 
Glazyev. 
  To quote Shokhin, preference was given to the variant 
presented by the State Duma's Budget Committee, chaired by 
Mikhail Zadornov, which proposed that the federal budget be kept 
within the limits already approved: revenues amounting to 124 
trillion rubles and spending - 194 trillion rubles. 
  Shokhin noted, however, that the State Duma leaders had 
taken 
the decision to channel all of the additional revenues gained 
from the privatization of federal property to the defense 
industry. "I think such a decision creates favorable conditions 
for the approval of the budget at the second reading," said 
Shokhin.

  [Text] On Tuesday the Federation Council approved a federal 
bill on limiting state borrowing abroad and credits granted by 
the Russian Federation to foreign countries in 1994. The bill 
was adopted by the State Duma on May 11. 
  The bill puts a limit on Russia's borrowing abroad at 4.7 
billion dollars, and on its credits to foreign countries at 400 
million dollars. It goes into effect as soon as it is published. 
  As the chairman of the Federation Council committee for 
budget, finances and currency regulation, Nikolay Gonchar, 
explained to the deputies, under the bill "the maximum size of 
credits will depend on the ability of Russia's economy to 
service its foreign debts." 
  According to him, since the amount of 4.7 billion dollars is 
one billion dollars less than the size of borrowing envisaged by 
Russia's Finance Ministry in this year's budget estimates, 
amendments will have to be made to the corresponding articles of 
the state budget without increasing the budget deficit or 
incurring additional expenditure. 
  According to the data submitted by Gonchar, Russia's foreign 
debt (not counting the debts to East European countries and 
overdue commercial payments registered by the beginning of 1994) 
surpassed 80 billion dollars, while the annual payments Russia 
is obliged to make under the schedule for servicing and repaying 
the main bulk of its debt exceeded 20 billion dollars in 
1992-1993. This year the payments connected with servicing and 
repaying the foreign debt, taking into account payments 
postponed from 1993, make up 32 billion dollars, or 70 percent 
of the export revenues expected this year.

<F P=106> [Boris Boyko report: "Nikolay Gonchar Has Started </F>
Campaigning for Independence"] 
  [Text] In its session yesterday the Federation Council 
refused to adopt the bill, recently approved by the State Duma, 
"On Making Changes and Additions into Some Laws of the Russian 
Federation on Taxation and Providing Privileges on Compulsory 
Payments to Non-Budget Funds." The budget committee proposed to 
reject the bill under the pretext that matters of expanding the 
list of tax breaks must be decided only in the context of 
reforming the entire tax system. The council as a whole, 
however, was more restrained and confirmed its readiness to pass 
the law after it was reworked in a corresponding manner, for 
which purpose it decided to set up a conciliation commission 
(including deputies from the Duma and the Federation Council). 
  It is noteworthy that the law approved by the Duma and 
bearing on tax breaks to election commissions, deputy 
candidates, election associations, and election foundations in 
financing election campaigns was drafted not by the government 
but by Duma deputies. The Federation Council's Budget Committee, 
whose position was presented by its chairman Nikolay Gonchar, 
found some "serious shortfalls" and violations of the current 
tax legislation in the law. Furthermore, the committee, citing 
the experience of foreign countries, also declared itself in 
favor of tougher restrictions on the size of untaxed donations 
by corporate entities to the election funds of candidates and 
election associations (under the law, these sums must not exceed 
the following sums: in elections to federal state power bodies, 
200 times and 20,000 times the minimum monthly wage, 
respectively; and in elections to local power bodies 100 times 
and 10,000 times). In the committee's opinion, financing 
election campaigns with voluntary donations in such amounts can 
result in an elected deputy's dependence on the will of the 
"donors" subsidizing his election campaign. 
  True, this argument appears a little strange. First, any 
deputy, per se, is a representative of certain local, social, 
and group interests in a legislative body (which follows from 
the designation of parliament as a form of social and regional 
compromise). Second, the experience of the United States, with 
its election fund raising race, shows that democracy is well 
compatible with the open financing of candidates; especially 
when this financing is done openly, not secretly. But Russia 
has different political ethics, which Nikolay Gonchar apparently 
follows. 
  According to the last article of the law, its effects extend 
to relations that arose after 1 January 1994. The Federation 
Council saw this not only as a source of possible losses to the 
budget (from which tax sums already paid will have to be 
returned), but also a possibility for the deputies even now to 
obtain funds to prepare the next election campaign. Therefore, 
judging by the nature of the Federation Council's remarks, the 
conciliation commission will have to spend much time to make 
sure the senate's laudable commitment to justice and legality 
(even to its own detriment) triumphs. 
  Interestingly, a Finance Ministry representative (Deputy 
Minister Sergey Aleksashenko), who was to have presented the law 
to the Federation Council, preferred participation in a press 
conference with government members to presence at the session. 
Nonetheless, according to Nikolay Gonchar, "he expressed his 
disagreement with the law on the telephone."

  [Text] If elected as the first Belarusian president, 
present Belarusian Premier Vyacheslav Kebich will undertake 
urgent measures in order to stop the run-away growth in prices 
and carry out wide-scale actions to fight crime. 
  The presidential elections in Belarus will take place on 23 
June. A total of six candidates for presidency have been 
officially registered, including Kebich, Belarusian parliament's 
ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belarusian opposition 
People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak and Communist leader Vasili 
Novikov. 
  Kebich said in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX that, if 
elected the president, he would carry out the agreement on the 
merging of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems. Kebich 
is considered one of the most likely winners of the presidential 
race. 
  However, he emphasized that the budgets of the two countries 
would not be merged. Kebich said that only two budget items 
would be coordinated -- the deficit and the amount of money 
issued. 
  Speaking about his contenders, Kebich feared that Zenon 
Poznyak might win the presidential elections. Kebich suggested 
that if Poznyak be elected, Belarus would face war, bloodshed 
and elimination of human rights and liberties. 
  He added that if the People's Front won the elections, this 
would mean a catastrophe for the whole Belarusian people. 
Kebich confirmed his suggestion by referring to the recent 
statement by Poznyak in the media. Poznyak had put forward 
territorial claims to Russia, Lithuania and Poland. Kebich said 
this was a dangerous policy which would lead to bloodshed.

  [Excerpts] [Reader from Minsk] One often reads and hears 
that Belarus owes large sums to foreign states in the near and 
far abroad, and that we are living at the expense of our 
children. What is the actual state of things? Official data 
are not published anywhere. 
  [Hryb] According to Finance Minister Yanchuk, the foreign 
debt of Belarus, excluding interest, amounted to $1022.2 million 
as of 1 April 1994. Taking into account interest, our debt 
reaches $1288.5 million. The Supreme Soviet adopted a 
resolution on 26 February 1994, determining the ceiling of the 
debt at $2 billion. Aside from this, the issue of mutual debts 
among former Soviet republics remains unresolved. According to 
National Bank estimates, other republics owe us 25830.1 million 
Belarusian rubles. However, these issues have not been 
confirmed by appropriate commitments. Is this a lot or a 
little? The world practice uses the system of foreign debt 
evaluation. Its primary characteristic is the correlation 
between the sum of the foreign debt, the GNP, and yearly export 
revenues. When correlation between foreign debt and the GNP 
amounts to 50 percent, the situation is believed to be critical. 
If our foreign debt reached $2 billion, this figure would still 
be 29 percent, while in Bulgaria it is 111, in Poland 54, in 
Hungary 65, and in Turkey 51 percent respectively. If we 
compare the correlation between our foreign debt and export 
revenues, where 257 percent is considered to be the critical 
figure, it is currently only 37 percent, while in Bulgaria it is 
203, in Hungary -- 157, in Poland -- 301, and in Turkey -- 193 
percent respectively. Thus, the facts testify to the 
contrary.[passage omitted] 
  [Reader from Minsk] Do you think that the dismissal of 
former Ministers Uladzimir Yahoraw and Eduard Shirkowski was 
just? If this is not a secret, how did you personally vote? 
  [Hryb] The decision to dismiss those two ministers was made 
by the Supreme Soviet and not me personally. However both 
violated the laws of the Republic of Belarus on the procedure of 
detaining foreign citizens on our territory and extraditing 
foreign and Belarusian citizens. This had been done many times. 
We had warned the ministers but the latter did not draw any 
conclusions. Thus they received what they deserved. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Reader from Vitebsk] As the Supreme Soviet chairman, do you 
consider yourself the guarantor of the observance of the 
Belarusian Constitution? Why were certain articles of the 
Constitution violated when the treaty on the unification of 
Belarusian and Russian monetary systems was being signed? Why 
did the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers remain 
silent? Why has Kebich not yet been sued? 
  [Hryb] As the Supreme Soviet chairman I have done everything 
in my power to guarantee the protection and observance of the 
basic law of Belarus. The Supreme Soviet did not discuss the 
issue of the unification; it was not on the agenda. The 
agreement can become valid only following a ratification by the 
legislature. The Belarusian Prosecutor's Office has 
investigated whether the prime minister violated the Belarusian 
Constitution while signing the agreement. The case was closed 
because of a lack of corpus delicti.[passage omitted] 
  [Reader from Minsk] Whom will we be electing -- a president 
or a governor general? After we have surrendered our National 
Bank and currency to Moscow, we will surrender our sovereignty 
too. This is evident. My second question is: Where does 
Kebich take money for all kinds of compensations, allowances, 
and the like? Who is financing his electoral campaign? 
  [Hryb] The Supreme Soviet and I have already stated that we 
do not promote any of the candidates. It is each person's 
personal business for whom to vote. On the other hand, the 
money earmarked for the electoral campaign was equally divided 
among the candidates. In the event of any embezzlements, the 
Central Electoral Commission will sort things out.[passage 
omitted] 
  [Reader from Minsk] I am worried and even enraged with the 
way signatures in support of Kebich were collected. Collective 
farm managers, village soviet chairmen, and all other empowered 
people scared people into signing the lists. Can these facts be 
investigated and those guilty punished? I am afraid that this 
may continue during the course of the elections -- there might 
be all kinds of fraud, pressure, or even unregistered 
ballot-boxes.... 
  [Hryb] We have requested that Central Electoral Commission 
Chairman A. Abramovich investigate these facts.[passage omitted]

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 1 June TASS--Turkey is 
interested in Moldavia's [Moldova's] prosperity and territorial 
integrity and is ready to provide it with broad assistance, 
visiting Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said. 
  In his address to the Moldavian Parliament on Wednesday, 
Demirel said that Turkish business circles are ready to invest 
in Moldavia's economy, especially its southern areas inhabited 
mostly by the Gagauz, Turkish-speaking minority. At the same 
time he stressed that the Gagauz must respect the territorial 
integrity of Moldavia. 
  Demirel called for granting Gagauz areas special legal 
status. He pointed out that Turkey's interest in the Gagauz 
should be viewed as a sign of the big importance it attaches to 
territorial integrity, peace and economic and social development 
of Moldavia. The Gagauz people must become a bridge of 
friendship and cooperation, which will help in strengthening 
ties between the two nations, he said. 
  Speaking about prospects for setting up an economic union of 
the Black Sea countries, the Turkish president said such a union 
would provide a new scheme of economic relations in the world. 
  Demirel is in Kishinev on a three-day official visit. During 
the visit, the sides will sign a treaty of friendship and 
cooperation and discuss Turkish investments in the Moldavian 
economy.

  [Text] Chisinau 1 June TASS -- Moldavian [Moldovan] 
President Mircea Snegur welcomed on Wednesday Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel's pledge of assistance to the Gagauz, a 
Turkish-speaking minority in Moldavia. 
  Snegur stressed that the Gagauz have broad rights in the 
republic. There are 49 Gagauz schools, a college and a 
university in areas predominantly inhabited by the Gagauz. 
There are also Gagauz radio and television programmes in 
Moldavia. 
  However, he pointed out that these areas need economic 
assistance to support economic reform, which, he said, have 
become irreversible. 
  Demirel confirmed during his talks with Snegur earlier today 
that Turkey is ready to provide economic and other assistance to 
the Gagauz people and help Moldavia sell its products in the 
world market. 
  Speaking about prospects for setting up an economic union of 
the Black Sea countries, the Turkish president said such a union 
would provide a new scheme of economic relations in the world. 
  Snegur praised Turkey for support, saying it was one of the 
first to have recognised Moldavia's independence and called for 
broader economic ties between the two countries. 
  "The treaty of friendship and cooperation which is being 
prepared now will give a new impetus to cooperation between our 
countries," he said.

  [Text] Chisinau 1 June TASS -- Russia said on Wednesday [1 
June] that from now on it will supply gas to Moldavia [Moldova] 
only on the basis of advance payments. 
  The decision announced by Russia's gas supplying concern 
Gazprom followed Moldavia's failure to pay for earlier gas 
supplies. 
  Moldavian gas industry head Boris Karandyuk said that 
Moldavia's debt to Russia is estimated at 257 billion roubles. 
About 107 billion roubles of that sum is owed by the break-away 
Dniester republic which is seeking economic and political 
independence from Moldavia. 
  About 70 per cent of the debt belongs to the Moldovenergo 
Association which supplies the republic with electricity and 
heat. 
  Karandyuk said that Moldavia has so far paid only 40 billion 
roubles and is ready to send a large shipment of food and 
industrial products worth 16 billion roubles to pay part of the 
remaining sum. 
  "We are seeking ways to pay the debt and intend to resort to 
foreign credits," Karandyuk said.

political, trade, and economic relations. The U.S. side, in 
particular, expressed interest in progress of privatization in 
the republic and its peculiarities as well as problems related 
to it. Kanat Saudabayev told the guests about the 
denationalization of state industrial enterprises which is in 
progress. He said that the biggest U.S. investments are being

<F P=106> [Vladimir Ardayev report: "Kazakhstan: Power Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- The Supreme Council of 
Kazakhstan has issued a statement containing its assessment of 
the activity of the republic government. 
  The statement notes that the government, while declaring a 
market-economy course, is essentially blocking it, which has 
resulted in economic chaos in Kazakhstan. The government, the 
statement says, has been unable to draw up a national reform 
program which could serve as the basis for the consolidation of 
society, given which the Supreme Council "is forced to express 
its lack of confidence in the government's socioeconomic and 
legal policy." 
  Parliament proposes "constructive dialogue among all the 
branches of power and social and political forces to create a 
national reform program and form a government capable of 
carrying it out" as the sole way to avoid total paralysis of 
power. Until such a program is adopted the Supreme Council 
intends to concentrate its attention on a number of issues, 
examination of the presidential edicts adopted in the absence of 
the legislative organ topping that list. Moreover, parliament 
has stated that it intends, first, to take a number of economic 
measures to give strong support to manufacturers; second, it 
intends to limit legislatively the executive branch's powers as 
regards the management of state property; and, third, it intends 
to extend the autonomy of enterprises in all kinds of ownership. 
  The statement issued at the start of the week has had a very 
mixed reaction. However, at a special press conference, deputy 
head of parliament Marat Ospanov assured journalists that the 
statement it in no way implies measures to dismiss the cabinet 
forthwith or any cadre changes in government, as this is the 
prerogative of the head of state. 
  President Nazarbayev's reaction to the parliamentary 
statement was "calm and considered," particularly as a lot in 
the statement coincides with his own stance. 
  As far as the cabinet itself is concerned, its press service 
has issued a statement which accuses parliament of being 
unconstitutional -- the government is responsible to the 
president alone -- and unconstructive. 
  Parliament's haste is, presumably, due to some extent to 
public opinion's dissatisfaction with parliament itself, whose 
activity (or, more accurately, its inactivity) has caused a good 
deal of censure in the Kazakhstan press since the middle of 
April. Nevertheless, the situation does reflect very accurately 
the power crisis in Kazakhstan, where the president, who has 
shouldered a heavy legislative burden, is unable to keep the 
cabinet's activity under complete control, and the government is 
unable to withstand the crisis, which is becoming increasingly 
irreversible and unmanageable in nature, while parliament simply 
does not know where to start and therefore starts by criticising 
the government.

stressed that Kazakhstan and Turkey have concluded about 60 
agreements, and most of them are at the stage of implementation. 
Over 150 Turkish companies are working in the republic now, and 
several joint banks have been set up. Turkey granted Kazakhstan 
a loan worth $200 million. This money is used for construction 
of a five-star hotel, a textile factory, a tannery, and other

  [Text] Kazakhstanis cannot get used to quickly changing 
prices for food, basic goods, and services. In mid-May prices 
for fuel have been increased very steeply, and this step was 
explained by objective necessities. For instance, for oil 
products the price has doubled, for electricity it has increased 
by a factor of 2.8; for heating by 3.3 times; for gas by 3.6 
times; and for rail haulage by 5 times. 
  As a KAZTAG correspondent was told at the Ministry of 
Economy 
pricing committee, this has automatically affected costs and 
prices for other products. 
  In late May, prices for dairy and meat products doubled, and 
as of 1 June prices increased for sugar, alcoholic drinks, and 
light industry goods. The city administration has confirmed that 
fares for public transportation in Almaty will double shortly. 
Prices for bread, rolls, and some varieties of pulses and 
combined fodder remain steady. One kilogram of beef in Almaty 
state shops costs about 45 tenge; pork 51 tenge; chicken 50 
tenge; butter 69 tenge; and sugar 47 tenge, which is by 2.5 
times more than three weeks ago; a half-liter bottle of 
Pshenichnaya vodka costs 73 tenge as of 1 June, which is also 
almost 2.5 times more expensive than it was yesterday; a bottle 
of three-star cognak is 83 tenge; of champagne 81 tenge. 
  This is not the limit, of course. According to the 
specialists of the pricing committee, prices for food will again 
increase by 20-25 percent shortly. It means our living standard 
will fall again, and more people will find themselves below the 
poverty level. One question remained unanswered -- when will 
wages be increased again, and when will the national currency 
finally stop falling?

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev has introduced a 
curfew for an indefinite period, beginning 22:00, June 1. The 
curfew will be in effect from 22:00 until 5:00, Groznyy time. 
  On May 28, the Chechen Government introduced a curfew in 
Grozny after an attempt on the president's life. 
  The republic's Commandant Sultan Geliskhanov told Interfax 
on 
Wednesday that the curfew had been introduced after Ingushetia's 
Malgobek and Sunzhen regions were added to the 
state-of-emergency zone in the region of the Ossetian-Ingush 
conflict in accordance with Boris Yeltsin's decree, approved by 
Russia's Federation Council. 
  On the one hand, part of the Malgobek and Sunzhen regions is 
a zone of territorial dispute between Chechnya and Ingushetia, 
and, on the other, Russian troops will find themselves in the 
direct vicinity of the Chechen border, he said. 
  Geliskhanov, who is also head of the Chechen Security 
Department, said that control over the observance of the curfew 
would be exercised by the Chechen Interior Ministry and security 
department. Special importance will be attached to the 
confiscation of illegally kept weapons and ammunition. 
  Commenting on the sociopolitical situation in Chechnya, 
Geliskhanov stated that "the forces which earlier tried to usurp 
power, have stepped up their activity again." Hoping for 
support from definite forces in Russia, the opposition is trying 
to deprive the Chechen people of their last chance to build a 
sovereign state, he said.

  [Text] The Chechen president has again spoken of the 
Russian threat. Dzhokhar Dudayev has stated that the Russian 
special services are drawing up a plan to organize an 
underground nuclear explosion on the republic's territory. 
Speaking on Groznyy television, Dudayev claimed that the 
special services may well implement this plan since their 
previously prepared attempt to physically remove the Chechen 
president ended in failure. During his appearance on television 
Dudayev expressed the opinion that if this plan for a localized 
nuclear explosion in Chechnya is carried out then the Russian 
special services will blame the republic's leadership for it, 
basing their statements on previously disseminated 
disinformation that Chechnya supposedly has components for 
nuclear weapons. The Russian foreign intelligence service has 
already categorically denied Dudayev's claims. 
  Incidentally, President Dudayev issued a decree today 
introducing a curfew throughout the territory of the republic 
beginning 2200 local time.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report under the "Province" rubric: </F>
"Yegor Gaydar Lifts Up Yaroslavl Country. Big Investors Start 
Pouring in To Governor Lisitsyn"] 
  [Text] The Days of Yaroslavl Oblast festival was under way 
in Moscow between 24 and 27 May. The oblast administration was 
pleased with the festivities' results, after having taken stock 
of them: Governor Anatoliy Lisitsyn announced at a news 
conference that two main goals could be reached -- to attract 
investments to the projects developed jointly with Gaydar's 
Institute of Economic Problems of the Transition Period, and to 
establish feedback between the capital and the major industrial 
and cultural center of Russia. 
  More than 40 projects received support from Russian and 
foreign investors. Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out, among the more 
successful ones, a project worth $450 million to reconstruct an 
oil refinery (and agreement was signed on a credit of $230 
million from an export-import bank) and a program for the 
construction of cottages developed jointly with the French firm 
"Phoenix." French Ambassador Pierre Morel confirmed the 
readiness of his government to provide a $40 million credit. 
  The successful fulfillment of the investment projects, 
according to Mr. Lisitsyn became possible thanks to the regional 
economy development program drawn up by the Gaydar Institute -- 
its specialists have been working in Yaroslavl Oblast since 
1993. During this time, according to Yegor Gaydar, it has become 
possible to identify the painful points in the structure of 
industrial production and to convert the enterprises to turning 
out products to match the current world trend. The institute 
is currently working on a scheme to create financial-industrial 
groups, and on a form of the local administration's 
participation in the process of bankruptcy of enterprises. 
  Speaking about relations between the center and the region, 
Mr. Lisitsyn pointed out that "now that the province has 
acquired genuine independence, it is important to overcome the 
lingering dependence on the center in the medium management 
echelon." The constructive process was moving along 
successfully at a time when, under Premier Ivan Silayev, 
regional policy was shaped by Valeriy Makharadze: It was in his 
time that the Union of Governors of Russia was formed. But 
after Sergey Shakhray took over the charge of regional policy, 
normal relations with Moscow virtually stopped. With the coming 
into the government of Nikolay Yegorov, former governor of 
Krasnodar Kray, "there may come a new stage of normalization of 
relations between the center and the regions," the governor of 
Yaroslavl Oblast stated.

  [Text] The President of Yakutia Mikhail Nikolayev has set 
special rules for entry and presence in the East Siberian 
republic within the Russian Federation. 
  The terms for entry and stay he decreed concern nationals 
from CIS and other countries as well as citizens of Russia's 
republics, not signatories to the Federative Treaty. 
  From now they will require a special invitation, agreed with 
local authorities, to be allowed into Yakutia. Besides, 
foreigners must identify their planned whereabouts, including 
the name of the street and house number, explain the purpose of 
their arrival and the duration of their stay in the republic. 
  In some instances, an applicant may be forbidden entry or be 
deported before his or her term of stay is up. Reasons for this 
could be actions detrimental to national security, public order, 
the established traditions and moral standards, custom, 
currency, and other regulations of Russia and Yakutia.

  [Text] The expedition to the small Kuril island of Yuriy 
(the Habomai archipelago, Far East) composed of representatives 
of the U.S.-Russian committee for search for servicemen killed 
during and after the Second World War, was in vain. 
  The expedition tried to find tombs of U.S. servicemen 
supposedly shot by the Japanese during the war. A total of 
three tombs were found. However, it turned out that these were 
the tombs of people who had died before the war. 
  However, the expedition will continue the search. It will 
come to Habomai in early summer, the SOVETSKIY SAKHALIN 
newspaper announced.

  [Text] Kyzyl, 1 Jun--The question of the legality of Tuva's 
joining Russia in 1944 is now completely meaningless. Republic 
President Sherig-ool Oorzhak said this on Tuesday during the 
festive ceremony of the signing of the Public Accord Treaty. 
This document was signed by representatives of all authorities, 
political parties--including the Communist Party--all public 
associations, and all religious persuasions. 
  The president addressed the fact that certain forces in the 
republic--first of all the nationalists--are still disputing the 
lawfulness of this decision made 50 years ago on the pretext 
that it was made by a narrow circle of leaders. Having voted at 
the December 1993 referendum in favor of the republic's 
Constitution-- which regards the republic as an integral part of 
Russia--Tuva's multiethnic people thus legitimized the 1944 
decision. In the president's view, the Public Accord Treaty 
plays a similar role today.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Bessonova, deputy chief of the oblast </F>
Directorate of Statistics: "More Deaths Than Births in 
Novosibirsk"] 
  [Text] [Begin bold]The number of people in Novosibirsk has 
increased throughout the post-war years. But now the 
demographic situation in the city is characterized as critical. 
Why?[end bold] 
  The population of Novosibirsk increased by 124,700 over the 
decade 1979-1988. The city population increased by 12,500, on 
average, each year. But just a few years ago the situation 
began to change. In 1989 the number of people in Novosibirsk 
increased by only 6,700, and in 1990, by only 3,500. In 1991 a 
loss in population was noted for the first time (of 4,400 
people). In 1992 the city population had decreased by 11,200, 
and in 1993--by 12,500. 
  Of course there were contributing factors to the exodus of 
people from Novosibirsk -- production decline and the reduced 
need for outside manpower. The emigration of Novosibirsk 
residents was also a factor of no small significance. In 1993, 
1,400 inhabitants of Novosibirsk had departed for places abroad. 
But on the whole, only 25 percent of the loss of population is 
due to migratory outflow. 
  Last year more people died than were born in all rayons of 
the city. As compared with 1992, the number of births decreased 
by 2,100 (16 percent), amounting to 10,600. Twenty thousand 
people died, 4,100 more than in 1992. 
  One of the objective factors contributing towards the 
reduced 
birth rate is the demographic echo of war. The fact of the 
matter is that our 20-29 year-old women are those of the sparse 
generations born at the end of the 60's-beginning of the 70's 
(i.e., the daughters of people born during the war and post-war 
years). 
  Also providing its contribution to the decline in birth 
rate, 
of course, is the present crisis situation in the country and 
factors related to it--the drop in standard of living of the 
populace and lack of confidence in what tomorrow will bring. 
  The number of registered marriages decreased by 119 in 1993, 
although the number of divorces also decreased last year. 
  Unfavorable changes in population mortality are being 
observed in the city. The mortality index increased over the 
year from 11.0 to 14.1 deaths per thousand population. The main 
causes of death in Novosibirsk remain diseases of the 
circulatory system (54 percent), tumors (16 percent), accidents, 
poisonings, and trauma (16 percent). The incidence of murder 
increased 1.5-fold over the past year; suicides increased by 27 
percent. 
  Thus, the demographic situation in Novosibirsk has indeed 
reached crisis proportions. Everywhere we see a declining birth 
rate and increased mortality rate, resulting in natural losses 
of the city population. In addition, the migrational exodus has 
reduced the number of inhabitants in all rayons of Novosibirsk. 
  The demographic situation of the city continues to 
deteriorate this year as well. The number of deaths in 
January-March was double the number of births.

<F P=106> [Pavel Orlov report: "Pasture Abandoned"] </F>
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- More than 20 agricultural 
enterprises in the Nizhniy Novgorod area have not carried out 
sowing work this spring. Sowing is unprofitable this year, 
their leaders say. Bank loans are extortionate and the state 
does not buy your output. 
  The renaming and reorganization of kolkhozes is not saving 
them from collapse. Meat and milk production is a loss-maker 
under current economic conditions. For instance, the 
"Ptitseprom" owes more than 10 billion rubles for mixed feed, 
and poultry factories are on the point of collapse. 
  Requests from farmers for partial compensation for their 
expenditure and for concessionary rates for energy fall on deaf 
ears. The oblast administration considers its most important 
task to be not to ensure stable provision of home-produced food 
to the population, but to divide up the land, creating a huge 
number of landowners...with spades.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels June 1 TASS -- Kyrgyzstan is now the 12th 
state and the third Central Asian republic to join the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme. The framework document was 
signed on Wednesday at the NATO headquarters here by Kyrgyz 
President Askar Akayev, who is currently paying an official 
visit to Belgium at the head of a Kyrgyz state delegation. 
  Taking the floor during the signing ceremomy, Akayev noted 
that the world was no longer divided into opposite blocs, but 
the process of the Soviet Union's disintegration proved to be 
painful; it is accompanied by conflicts and crises in the 
economic and other spheres of public life. 
  "This is why Kyrgyzstan is turning its attention to 
international unions, set up by the civilised mankind -- the 
United Nations, the CSCE, the NATO, etc. It shares the idea of 
partnership as an expression of its conviction that the 
stability and security of every country can be ensured only 
through joint actions," Akayev stated. The president reaffirmed 
the adherence of his country to the principles of freedom and 
democracy, stressing that liberty and human rights were at the 
bedrock of Kyrgyz state policy. 
  "But the road of democratic and market reforms proved longer 
and more difficult than initially anticipated. Exploiting the 
difficulties of the country, the communists, nationalists and 
other conservative forces are endeavouring to turn back its 
development. The crisis can be overcome only in conditions of a 
strong democratic state and through cooperation with the 
international community," he stated. The president specially 
stressed America's huge role in the support given to the 
independent Kyrgyzstan. 
  Acting NATO Secretary-General Sergio Balancino noted the 
alliance's readiness to cooperate with Kyrgyzstan in many areas, 
beginning with peace-making operations and ending with the 
creation of democratically controlled armed forces. He noted 
Akayev's role and efforts to implement democratic reforms, to 
promote the freedom of speech, and to guarantee the rights of 
all the citizens of the country and of its national minorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev by Eric </F>
Meyer in Bishkek; date not given: "On the Democratization of 
Kyrgyzstan] 
  [Text] [Meyer] This week, you are making a tour of Europe. 
Of the five republics of former Soviet Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan 
is considered to be the most democratic: Is this reputation 
deserved? 
  [Akayev] It is well deserved. All our efforts are 
concentrated on achieving this. Kyrgyzstan is founded on the 
rule of law and is on the road to democracy. It is also true 
that our process of democratization is proceeding at a faster 
pace than in other countries in Central Asia. We have more 
political parties than in France, and when it comes to freedom 
of the press, the Kyrgyzstan's president is criticized more than 
President Mitterrand! 
  [Meyer] Why? 
  [Akayev] I see three reasons. First, our democratic 
traditions. We have always been the nomads of Central Asia, a 
lifestyle which favors democracy. For example, our traditional 
seat of power, the Council of Judges (Boloush) is elected. The 
Kyrgyz are a very ancient people, older than the Kazakhs. We 
can be traced back, in ancient Chinese texts, to as early as the 
second century. 
  Another reason is our multi-ethnic structure: One Kyrgyz in 
four is European, German, Russian, or another Slav. Finally, 
our country has always been open to the outside world (except 
during the Soviet era: editor's note). The Silk Road passed 
through our land, which allowed us to assimilate traditions of 
both the West and the East, and allowed us to quickly adapt to a 
market economy; we are culturally prepared! 
  [Meyer] Why do people here so often hold up Switzerland as a 
model of development for Kyrgyzstan? 
  [Akayev] In terms of state structure, we are closer to the 
French model. Our Constitution reflects the French 
Constitution, in terms of the separation of powers between the 
president, the prime minister, parliament, and prefects. Our 
fascination with Switzerland relates to something else. 
Kyrgyzstan is like the reflection of Switzerland in Central 
Asia. We also live in high mountains, the Ala-Too chain. Lake 
Geneva is like our Lake Issyk Kul. Another similarity is that 
both our peoples consist of three principal ethnic groups. With 
its French-speaking, German-speaking, and Italian-speaking 
cantons, Switzerland has been able to create a confederation. 
We have 80 ethnic groups, but with three major ones: Kyrgyz, 
Russians, and Uzbeks. Our journalists like to taunt me when I 
say that Kyrgyzstan will become the Switzerland of Central Asia: 
How, they think, can we compare ourselves to this "little giant" 
with its high tech industry and advanced social system? My 
answer: By building a state founded on the rule of law! 
  [Meyer] What do you expect from Europe and what can 
Kyrgyzstan offer Europe in return? 
  [Akayev] I expect a great deal! We already have links with 
Europe, with Switzerland and Germany for example, but they are 
still fragile. We are the only country in the CIS to have made 
the change to a market economy according to the criteria of the 
IMF and the World Bank. We are now embarking upon the 
renovation of economic structures, which requires investment and 
technology transfer. Europe has both of these. I am seeking to 
stimulate the interest of your private investors in the 
reconstruction and conversion of our industries. In return, we 
can offer preferential terms for mining rare metals and raw 
materials used in the new technologies and the strategic field. 
We also have a natural environment which is perfect for the 
development of green tourism. 
  [Meyer] You are a scientist by training, rather than a 
career 
politician; does this background lead you to adopt a different 
approach to your presidency? 
  [Akayev] You know Napoleon, when he wanted to reward his 
mathematics teacher, Laplace, he made him interior minister. 
Shortly afterwards, as Laplace was constantly bothering him with 
one little problem after another, the emperor decorated him, at 
the same time sending him packing to continue his beloved 
studies. I never use my scientific methods in politics. I 
prefer to use the experience of previous great politicians whose 
memoirs I read, such as de Gaulle, or Eisenhower. The other day 
when I was in Moscow at the theater for a performance of "Fouche 
and Talleyrand," a very popular play at the moment, I said to 
myself: "I need ministers like that." When he got up in the 
morning, Fouche knew everything which had happened during the 
night, even in the Emperor's chamber. But my interior minister 
does not even know what is happening inside his ministry. My 
finance minister is unable to collect more than 35 percent or 40 
percent of the taxes. Fouche collected 200 percent, and without 
annoying anybody! After the Great Depression, Roosevelt, who 
was advised to form a government of scientists, replied: 
"Scientists are like sugar in your coffee. If there are too 
many, it's undrinkable!" So I try to develop realpolitik. 
<H5>  We Are Trying To Curb Russian Emigration </H5>
  [Meyer] Is there a risk of ethnic rifts in Kyrgyzstan? 
  [Akayev] This problem is arising throughout Central Asia. 
Our large Russian minorities are emigrating. It is a natural 
process. France and Great Britain experienced the same thing in 
the 1950's and 1960's, and the return of the Algerian-born 
Frenchmen could have had serious consequences in France if there 
had not been men like de Gaulle or Pompidou around at that time. 
We have had ethnic problems, but so far we have managed to 
avoid the worst. The departure of the Russians is one of the 
conditions of democratization, but these Russians are also 
qualified workers. We are trying to curb their departure. 
  [Meyer] One of your big problems is corruption. What is the 
scope of corruption? 
  [Akayev] It has always existed, and there is no doubt that 
it 
is getting worse during this transitional period. We are seeing 
some people grow breathtakingly wealthy while the mass is on the 
brink of poverty. If we do not manage to halt it, then the 
situation could explode. We need more than our forces alone to 
fight it. Foreign influence, in the form of joint ventures, 
technologies, and new blood, can only be a good thing. 
<H5>  Maintaining the Balance Between China and Russia </H5>
  [Meyer] What are your relations with China, your big 
neighbor 
on the other side of the Tian Shan mountains, unknown territory 
during the 30 years of Cold War, until 1989. 
  [Akayev] This question is of crucial importance for all of 
Central Asia. As a region, we are flanked by two superpowers. 
We see them as two wings to help us take off. Flying on these 
two wings is our guarantee of sovereignty. Russia is our main 
ally and leading trade partner. I hope we can bequeath this 
stability, which is the fruit of our parents' efforts, to our 
children. Our Russian cultural and scientific heritage serves 
as our opening to the world. Through Russia, we are European, 
the children of Montesquieu and Diderot. 
  For us, however, China is 1,000 km of border and 2,000 years 
of common history. The first working school in this country was 
Chinese. Via the Silk Route, the Chinese traded their textiles 
for our sturdier horses. I pray to God that Russia and China 
will always maintain good relations, because that is an 
essential condition for our security and the security of all 
Eurasia! 
  [Meyer] During his recent visit, did Chinese Prime Minister 
Li Peng ask you to bring under Chinese administration the 
Uighurian exile organizations from Xinjian ? 
  [Akayev] No. We have 24 ethnic organizations. We appreciate 
their desire to be different and to maintain their identity, on 
a strictly cultural level. Our relations with China are 
normalizing, and it cannot put pressure on us. 
  [Meyer] Do you see the possibility of a rebirth of the 
ancient empires of Central Asia, in a confederal or other form? 
  [Akayev] No. There will be no rebirth of the Turkestan of 
old. Uzbeks and Kyrgyzis, for example have the same linguistic 
and religious roots, but are very different. Our goals are the 
same: To build a democracy based on a market economy. However, 
the paths we have chosen are not the same. Another example can 
be seen in the fact that the Turkmenistan's president wants to 
return to authoritarian methods to establish democracy. We do 
not have the same approach. It is impossible to restore 
Turkestan under these conditions. 
  However, there are things which we must recreate together: 
The democratic area and the borderless market that existed 
1,000 years ago in Central Asia; the free trade of goods and 
labor. The wellbeing of the peoples leads to solidarity. Three 
presidents, Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Karimov of Uzbekistan, and 
myself, recently signed an agreement to avoid any hindrances to 
trade. Finally, we must avoid using the concept of Turkestan as 
a political pawn to counterbalance China: Nothing will be done 
against China.

<F P=106> [Report by Gulyana Khusanova, incorporating interview with </F>
Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian 
Border Troops in Tajikistan; place and date not given: "Spring 
Offensive Has Failed To Materialize, but Two Russian Border 
Guards Have Been Killed on the Tajik-Afghan Border in Recent 
Days"] 
  [Text] Dushanbe -- The military's forecasts regarding a 
major spring offensive by the armed Tajik opposition on the 
Tajik-Afghan border have not worked out. 
  But Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the 
Russian Border Troops in Tajikistan, considers that the 
situation could deteriorate at any moment. 
  [Chechulin] Several hundred armed supporters of the Islamic 
Revival Movement of Tajikistan are concentrated in a number of 
our neighboring territory's border regions. Their redeployment 
toward the border has been observed of late. 
  [Khasanova] Some people are of the opinion that Russia is 
paying too high a price in its soldiers' blood and lives to 
protect the sovereign Tajik border. Twenty-five men have been 
killed in the 12th Border Troop Subunit. Could something 
similar happen again? 
  [Chechulin] The families of the dead will forgive me, and I 
hope it does not sound blasphemous, but we did learn a good 
lesson from what happened ten months ago. I can now say with a 
full sense of responsibility what the likelihood of a repetition 
of the tragedy is. Everything has been done to ensure that 
every border subunit or border post, without exception, can 
repulse enemy attacks until the approach of reserves. We have 
highly mobile motorized subunits, airborne assault units, 
artillery, and military aircraft at our disposal. The 
Tajik-Afghan border today is a system of modern obstacles, 
including mined obstacles. We are setting up our own air 
defense system. One in ten soldiers in the border troops is on 
contract. The border troop subunits and border detachments are 
manned at wartime strength. 
  [Khasanova] You will agree that such a situation cannot go 
one for ever. The Tajik border must be taken under the 
protection of units of the national army and local border 
troops. When will this happen? 
  [Chechulin] Tajik units now mainly occupy the second 
echelons, while we occupy the front echelons. This distance, 
does not, incidentally, prevent our successfully carrying out 
joint operations. However, I do think the time will come when 
Tajikistan will have to guarantee the security of its own border 
by its own devices. I don't, however, think this is going to 
happen soon. 
  I cannot agree with the opinion that Russian troops should 
be 
withdrawn from here. The presence of Russia, which has its own 
indisputable geopolitical interests here, is a real necessity. 
The more successful the talks between the Dushanbe authorities 
and the opposition are, the more nominal the Russian military 
presence in Tajikistan will become.

Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Dushanbe officials want to discuss the return of all 
Tajik refugees from Afghanistan and elsewhere and security of 
the Tajik-Afghan border during the talks with the opposition 
that are scheduled to be held in Tehran in mid-June. First 
Deputy Chairman Abdujalil Dostiyev of the country's Supreme 
Soviet told INTERFAX that the refugees who had fought for the 
opposition in the civil war would not be prosecuted because they 
were covered by the amnesty. 
  Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Alimov said that no final date 
had been set for the Tehran talks. He would not mention any 
date so as not to harm the negotiating process. 
  Alimov said that there would be no changes in the Tajik 
Government delegation. 
  INTERFAX Note: In the Moscow round of talks on 5-19 April 
the two sides agreed on the agenda which includes now a 
ceasefire, return of the refugees and subsequent consultations. 
The opposition, notably Akbar Turajonzoda, one of its leaders, 
wants the government delegation, now headed by Labor and 
Employment Minister Shukurjon Zukhurov, to be upgraded. 
  Observers in Dushanbe are concerned that the recent killings 
of Russian border guards in Tajikistan may have a negative 
impact on the talks. Meanwhile, General Anatoliy Kuptsov, 
deputy security minister, dismissed the speculation that these 
killings were politically motivated. He said that these were 
common crimes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Uzbekistan: Inaccessible Ostankino"] </F>
  [Text] For several months now Uzbekistan has had to be 
satisfied with a truncated Ostankino service and has been 
virtually robbed of Russian TV. Russian viewers have been left 
without sports, educational, cultural, and children's programs. 
Their small screens only come on at 1800 hours. The local 
authorities say that the two television companies owe the 
republic's Ministry of Communications 1 billion rubles for the 
use of 250 relay stations. Many Moscow newspapers stopped being 
printed in Uzbekistan even earlier, and you cannot find anything 
in the local kiosks now apart from TRUD and RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. 
The "literary monthly" journals are not arriving either. For 
three years now there has not been a single theater, singer, or 
group from Russia on tour even in Tashkent. Television was the 
only salvation from a total cultural vacuum. 
  Ostankino undoubtedly still has the highest rating in the 
republic. A recent sociological poll showed that the other 
channels broadcasting in Uzbek and Turkish get just a third of 
the viewers, at best. It is presumably the popularity of 
Russian television that irritates the primitive jingoists who 
see Ostankino as almost "subversive." 
  Another story has it that local television personnel are 
interested in cutting Ostankino in order to "make a killing" out 
of the advertising profits. 
  Typically the problem of Ostankino is not even being 
discussed in the local press. This is a clear sign, as is the 
custom in Uzbekistan, that top mandarins have had a hand in the 
decision to cut back broadcasting. 
  Viewers in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] picketed the republic's 
television and radio company, the government immediately 
backpedaled and switched on Moscow television right away.

  [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- "The completion of the 
negotiation process between Ukraine and Russia over the division 
of the Black Sea Fleet is vital for settling the Crimean 
problem," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said. 
  In his address to the Ukrainian parliament on the situation 
in the Crimea on Wednesday, Kravchuk said that "we must not 
demand that Russia immediately withdraw its ships from 
Sevastopol. This would be wrong from the strategic point of 
view in the first place." 
  Ukraine cannot ban Russia from keeping a navy force in the 
Black Sea. History has bound Russia and Ukraine to live in 
peace and friendship and be equal partners, Kravchuk said. He 
added that the question of the fleet is the "question of Ukraine 
and Russia." 
  He stressed that it must be solved gradually, without 
causing 
the situation to worsen. He agreed that the fleet should be 
divided and based in different places, but stressed the need to 
determine the status of the Russian part of the fleet which will 
be located in Ukraine. 
  Ukraine is seeking to find such a solution which would "meet 
the national interests and take into account Russia's security 
needs in the south," Kravchuk said. He noted that in the future 
Russia will have to set up a navy base on its own territory. 
  The Ukrainian leader emphasised that after the recent talks 
in Moscow between the Russian and Ukrainian official delegations 
"some details of the agreements on the fleet are beginning to 
take shape." He said that the talks will resume in the near 
future. 
  Kravchuk stressed that the Crimean issue is vital not only 
for Ukraine and the Crimea, but also "all European states and 
the world community."

  [Text] The principle of Ukraine's staying outside any 
military blocks laid down in its military doctrine adopted last 
year is in need of reconsideration, Ukrainian Defense Minister 
Vitaliy Radetskyy told a news conference in Kiev Wednesday. He 
pointed out that "today no state can defend itself on its own." 
  Radetskyy's news conference was devoted to the results of 
his 
visit to NATO headquarters from May 25 to 27. During his visit, 
Radetskyy submitted a presentation document on Ukraine joining 
the Partnership for Peace program to NATO. Ukraine joined the 
program in February 1994 when Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko signed a framework agreement with NATO. 
  Commenting on the situation in Crimea, Radetskyy said that 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had "sent not a single soldier to 
Crimea recently." He said that the bulk of military hardware 
which had been delivered in the recent past to Crimea belonged 
to the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Radetskyy criticized Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's 
personnel policy, saying that 80 percent of his surroundings 
were former Ukrainian servicemen citing as an example Interior 
Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov and Security Service Chairman 
Vladimir Lepikhov. 
  Radetskyy declined to comment on Ukraine's position at the 
talks on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, saying 
these complicated issues were being discussed by Russian and 
Ukrainian delegations in Sevastopol. At the same time, he 
pointed out that the division of vessels had been completed. 
  According to Radetskyy, the Russian part of the Black Sea 
Fleet will be stationed on the Ukrainian territory as fleet of a 
foreign state.

  [Text] Speaking in parliament Wednesday morning, President 
Leonid Kravchuk offered lawmakers to amend the law on the 
delimitation of powers between Ukraine and Crimea "by envisaging 
more powers for Crimean authorities." 
  Simultaneously, he called for correcting Ukraine's laws on 
the security and police services so that Crimea's "so-called 
power structures" be unconditionally subordinate to the central 
authorities. 
  He proposed an early reform of Ukraine's Constitutional 
Court, which, in his opinion, is called upon to abolish all 
Crimean administration decisions as "illegal." He motivated 
such a reform by scarce powers of the Supreme Soviet, which, in 
his words, "can only suspend illegal autonomy acts rather than 
abolish them." He is ready to submit as soon as possible for 
parliamentary endorsement candidates to Constitutional Court 
judges. 
  He spoke in favour of a subcommission to be set up in 
Supreme 
Soviet to deal exclusively with Crimea's problems and accepted a 
proposal to set up within the cabinet an office of a 
vice-premier on territorial issues. 
  Stressing his desire for a peace settlement without 
conflict, 
Kravchuk pointed out that "calm and peace are possible only if 
the Crimean leadership recognized the priority of Ukraine's 
Constitution and laws. He observed for this reason that "power 
in Crimea has been taken over by the party that proclaimed as 
its strategy Crimea's secession from Ukraine and its return to 
Russia." 
IF Note: May 30 marked the expiration of Kiev's ultimatum to 
Simferopol, which was demanded to reverse its decision to 
restore the May 6, 1992 Constitution. The dual citizenship and 
formal bilateral ties envisaged by the Constitution have proved 
unacceptable for Kiev. As Interfax has learned from 
parliamentary circles in Simferopol, at a session of the faction 
of the Russia bloc of parties -- the major Crimean parliament's 
faction -- lawmakers found it inexpedient to go on its decision 
and reconsider the Constitution. 
  Kravchuk believes that the situation in Crimea might be 
greatly improved by an early solution to the Black Sea Fleet's 
problem, above all setting up separate naval bases for Ukraine 
and Russia. 
  As the chief Ukrainian negotiator to negotiations with 
Crimean lawmakers, Boris Oleinik has reported to Interfax that 
Crimea may be discussed in the Ukrainian parliament in linkage 
with the Black Sea Fleet's problem on Wednesday. 
  The main task for the Ukrainian delegation is to "find out 
whether Crimea's parliament is in principle prepared to make 
concessions and abolish its last decisions as unconstitutional".

  [Text] Having returned from NATO headquarters in Brussels, 
Ukraine Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskiy, who had 
been taking part in the work of his foreign counterparts, 
immediately left to visit the troops. During an inspection of 
the 6th Army Corps of the Odessa Military District he granted an 
exclusive interview to our correspondent Marat Pohorelov. 
  [Begin Radetskiy recording] In the first instance we handed 
a 
presentation document Partnership for Peace which clearly 
stipulates our stand at the current stage. This presentation 
document, if one has a close look at it [pauses], and this 
testifies to the fact that we will still be revising it and, 
along with the improvement of the economic situation in the 
state, our views of our participation in the Partnership for 
Peace will be changing. 
  I met the acting secretary [as heard], and we had an 
approximately 30-minute talk with him. He listened to me very 
attentively, and questioned me about the situation in the state 
as a whole and about the state of affairs in the armed forces. 
He paid special attention to the current situation in Crimea 
and shared our views, our thoughts, and our concern over this 
issue. 
  I met Secretary of Defense Perry. I had meetings with 12 
defense ministers. We were discussing issues of military 
cooperation, all of them being directly related to the state of 
affairs in our country as a whole, its economic and political 
state. 
  Information supplied about Crimea seems to be one-sided. It 
mostly comes from the Russian Federation, and the Russian 
Federation is expressing thoughts which are useful to them, 
which are of interest to them today, which are to their 
advantage. As far as the real state of affairs is concerned, 
what is being done, who is providing Crimea economically, what 
is the situation there, what kind of troops are there. By the 
way, nobody was dispatching any troops there, we did not send 
even a single extra soldier there, not a single armored vehicle, 
not a single tank, not a single submachinegun was dispatched 
there [sentence as heard]. 
  And I would express a wish that Ukraine should supply more 
comprehensive information: Television, radio, the Ukrainian 
press should supply more clear-cut information about what is 
being done in our state and pay special attention to the Crimean 
issue. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- "Official Simferopol must remember 
that Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and therefore it 
ought to bring the Constitution of the autonomous republic in 
line with Ukrainian legislation." That was the main idea of 
today's speeches by Ukrainian parliamentarians during the debate 
on the "Crimean question." 
  Some deputies demanded that the Constitution of the Crimean 
republic be suspended until it is brought in line with the 
Constitution of Ukraine, and that the population of the 
peninsula should abide by the laws of the Ukrainian state. Some 
said that the powers of the Crimean Supreme Council must be 
suspended early. In this connection, the Ukrainian president 
was asked to set up executive bodies of state power on the 
territory of Crimea and to ensure that Ukraine's constitutional 
norms are observed. 
  Many speakers believe that the situation in Crimea is 
adversely affected by the presence of Russian military units. 
In the opinion of some deputies, talks should be held with the 
Russian president about the withdrawal of Russian military 
formations, ships, and associations of the Black Sea Fleet 
beyond Ukrainian borders. However, the Ukrainian president does 
not share this point of view. He believes that "this issue 
cannot be approached from this angle". This would be wrong above 
all from a strategic point of view, he said. Ukraine cannot 
afford to deprive Russia of the possibility of having its own 
fleet in the Black Sea, he said. 
  History determined that Ukraine and Russia must be friends, 
live in peace with each other, and have relations of equal 
partnership, he said. The question of the fleet is an "issue 
between Ukraine and Russia," Leonid Kravchuk stressed. And it 
must be resolved gradually without making the situation worse. 
  Some parliamentarians believe that in many respects the 
Crimean issue has arisen because socio-economic problems on the 
peninsula remain unresolved.

Crimea are ready for any situation that may develop on the 
peninsula," the Crimean president's military adviser Petr 
Chernyatevich declared in conversation over the telephone with a 
RIA correspondent. A plenary session of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Crimea is opening today to discuss questions relating to the 
present situation. The reaction of the Crimean parliamentarians 
will depend on what decisions the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet 
passes today, believes Chernyatevich. 
  The Crimeans hold a wait-and-see position which can be 
described as the state of civil readiness, according to 
Chernyatevich. He expressed the confidence that the people 
would allow nobody to violate its Constitution. "Kiev must 
reckon with the fact that we have a nationally elected president 
and a nationally elected Supreme Soviet, and the will of the 
people is something that one has to reckon with," said the 
Crimean president's adviser. 
  Right today Petr Chernyatevich intends to meet with the 
commander of the Ukrainian National Guard, Colonel Aleksandr 
Kostyukov in order to find out the reasons and aims of the 
continuing movements of the units subordinate to him.

  [Text] Kiev, Ukraine, June 1 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman 
Demirel on Wednesday said that Turkey strongly regrets 
conditional U.S. aid to Turkey. 
  "We do not consider this a friendly gesture," he told 
reporters in the Ukraine where he is on an official visit. 
  The U.S. House of Representatives, which approved on 
Wednesday a 13.5-billion-dollar foreign aid bill for fiscal 
1995, withheld a quarter of the 363 million dollars earmarked 
for Turkey in foreign military sales, pending progress on human 
rights and on Cyprus. 
  "We strongly regret the fact that the aid will be tied to 
conditions such as human rights, terror and Cyprus," he said. 
"Under these circumstances, it is only natural that the 
extension of the multi-national allied forces in Incirlik was 
not discussed at the National Security Council meeting which was 
held during the weekend. 
  "The mandate for the forces is to end by the end of this 
month," he said. Demirel pointed out that the force had been 
invited by Turkey in the first place to protect northern Iraqi 
Kurds from renewed attacks by Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn after a 
failed Kurdish rebellion following Iraq's Gulf War defeat. 
  "We have been defending them (northern Iraqi Kurds) for 
years," he said. "But now we are facing such behavior by the 
U.S. Congress. The extension of the mandate is to the advantage 
of Turkey and we shall meet with the Security Council again to 
discuss it." 
  Regarding the U.N.-imposed trade embargo against Iraq, 
Demirel said that Turkey has suffered from it and that nowhere 
on earth can innocent people be so punished, referring to the 
people of Iraq. 
  "The integration of the Iraqi Government to the 
international 
community is leading the country to disintegration and this will 
hurt world peace," he said. "Unfortunately the United States, 
Britain and France have transformed it into an internal 
political issue." 
  Demirel also stressed that neither Turkey nor the Arab world 
wants Iraq's disintegration.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Potemkin report: "Turks Love Ukrainian Flounder"] </F>
  [Text] An unusual procession appeared in the roads of the 
port of Odessa early in the morning of 28 May -- the border 
vessel P. Derzhavin towing a bright red Turkish fishing 
schooner. The fishermen, who had full black moustaches, were 
resignedly sunning themselves, lounging on coils of nets. A 
mountain of fish, protected from the sun by a covering of straw, 
rose up in the middle of the schooner. The border guards had 
marked their professional day (which, by the way, is not 
officially celebrated in Ukraine) by arresting the first 
violator of the economic border since 1991. 
  The great power has collapsed. We can't even sort out our 
internal borders, let alone the external ones: The Japanese 
pilfer the sea stock off Sakhalin while the Turks run the show 
in the Black Sea, treating it as if it were their own little 
pond. 
  "The Turks know that we don't have enough fuel or seaworthy 
ships to patrol and so they become brazen," Captain Third Rank 
Grigoriy Zubov, deputy chief of the border brigade, told me. 
"Then fuel appeared. We make our first trip out and come back 
with a `catch'." 
  There are a lot of fish in the coastal waters today. The 
economic crisis has helped: The kolkhozes have no money to buy 
toxic chemicals, which the rain later washes out to sea, while 
the industrial giants and heat and electric power stations, 
which polluted the water with their discharges, are idle. And 
so flounders, beluga, and mullet are returning to their native 
coastal waters. While Turkish schooners, having laid in 
kilometers of netting, sail in pursuit of them. 
  The poaching by the schooner Mekke [name as transliterated] 
in the Black Sea's coastal waters is not the first documented 
case of violation of the country's maritime area this year. At 
the beginning of May, a fleet of 24 Turkish ships essentially 
blocked off the spawning routes of the flounder with their nets 
in the Skadovsk area. A small fisheries protection vessel which 
went out to investigate the violation was attacked by the Turks. 
Border guard vessels summoned from Balaklava and Odessa to 
seize the foreign fishermen were unable to do so, as the latter 
escaped into neutral waters. 
  This time the border guard vessel spotted the poachers' 
marker buoys east of the island of Zmeinyy. It was immediately 
obvious that they were not local fishermen's nets: Under 
Ukrainian legislation, it is forbidden to take flounders in the 
Black Sea; this fish was on the verge of extinction until quite 
recently. After a while the owner of the nets -- a Turkish 
schooner, calmly making its way towards its haul -- appeared. 
  It transpired that the Turks were using around 3 kilometers 
of net, in which 740 flounder, beluga, dogfish, and skate 
quivered. More than 20 dolphin caught up in the net suffocated 
to death. The damage caused to the Black Sea's ecology, even at 
modest Ukrainian prices, comes to several thousand dollars. 
  Estura Bogadina [names as transliterated], the captain and 
owner of the schooner Mekke, now awaits trial in Odessa. The 
vessel and nets will remain in the port of Odessa until a fine 
is paid.

  [Text] Sevastopol June 1 TASS -- Naval officers and sailors 
serving at the Black Sea Fleet base in the Crimean settlement of 
Donuzlava filed a protest today against the planned transition 
of the base to the Ukrainian Navy. 
  The written protest was handed over to Admiral Feliks 
Gromov, 
commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, who is now on an 
inspection tour in the Crimea. 
  TASS has learnt that according to the document, over seven 
thousand naval officers and sailors, servicemen of the base's 
garrison, as well as their families will find themselves without 
means of subsistence and will have to leave their homes looking 
for new jobs and housing in case the base in Donuzlava is put 
under the Ukrainian command. Moreover, the protesters are sure 
the base and the settlment will inevitably fall into decay. 
  During the Moscow talks on the Black Sea Fleet's division 
between Russia and Ukraine, the Donuzlava base was named among 
possible locations of the Ukrainan share of the disputed fleet.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev in the "Ukraine" </F>
column: "An Ecological Aspect Has Emerged in the Black Sea 
Fleet Division Problem. Damage by the Russian Navy Could Amount 
to 53 Billion Karbovanets a Year"] 
  [Text] The Ukraine Environment Protection Ministry has 
issued a report saying that $17.16 billion is required to clean 
up environmental pollution caused by Black Sea Fleet units 
located on Ukraine's territory. According to the ministry, in 
the Sevastopol bay alone vessels dump approximately 1,000 cubic 
meters of untreated sewage water every day. The main pollution 
source in the Sevastopol bay is a fuel tank. Underground 
waters, the soil, and the sea bed are contaminated. In some 
parts of the bay the depth of toxic deposits reaches 40 meters. 
  The Sevastopol bay is virtually dead. Approximately 30 
ships, as well as ammunition and spare parts, are lying at its 
bottom. One-third of the land occupied by fleet bases needs 
recultivation. The volume of contaminated underground waters is 
approximately 4 million cubic meters. In the event of the 
fleet's division in the proportions envisioned (18 percent of 
vessels to Ukraine and the rest to Russia), according to the 
Environmental Protection Ministry, the Ukraine Main Ecological 
Inspectorate, and the corresponding services of the Republic of 
Crimea and Sevastopol city, the environmental damage from the 
Russian Navy on Ukrainian territory will amount to 53 billion 
karbovanets a year. 
  The Ukrainian Environmental Protection Ministry has demanded 
that the ecological aspect of the problem be taken into 
consideration in sharing out the Black Sea Fleet because 
neutralizing the effects of the fleet's activity exceeds the 
cost of the fleet itself by three to three and a half times.

  [Excerpts] Kiev [no date as received] -- Speaking at a 
plenary session of Ukraine's Supreme Council today, President 
Leonid Kravchuk emphasized an urgent need to resolve the 
situation in Crimea, describing it as a matter of peace on the 
European continent. [passage omitted] 
  Leonid Kravchuk stressed that peace on the peninsula can be 
achieved only by placing Crimea in the framework of Ukraine's 
Constitution and laws. He said that the Crimean leaders' 
references to the agreement between Tatarstan and the Russian 
Federation as an example are misplaced since they cite an 
agreement between a federation and its part which clearly 
defines the federation's supremacy. 
  Leonid Kravchuk described the actions of the Crimean 
leadership as destructive to Ukraine's sovereignty. He said 
Ukraine's Government has always met Crimea halfway, which is 
obvious from the laws on the delimitation of powers between the 
state authorities of Ukraine and Crimea and on the open economic 
system in Crimea that enables the republic to function in a wide 
legal range. The Government of Ukraine also accepts Crimea's 
proposals of wide- ranging budgetary freedom. But Crimea is not 
living up to its budgetary obligations. 
  Leonid Kravchuk also pointed out Crimea's tendency to 
attract 
specialists from Russia which reveals a disregard for local 
personnel and, in the president's view, violates the law of 
Ukraine on citizenship. [passage omitted] 
  Leonid Kravchuk stressed that stabilization in Crimea will 
facilitate completion of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia 
on the division of the Black Sea Fleet, the deployment of the 
two fleets from separate bases, a definition of the status of 
the Crimea-based Russian fleet, payment of compensation for the 
ships which Ukraine is giving up as redundant, the division of 
the marine infantry, and so on. 
  Leonid Kravchuk proposed a draft resolution to be passed by 
Ukraine's Supreme Council "On Implementation of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council Resolution of 20 May 1994 on Suspension of the 
Law of the Crimean Republic on the Restoration of the 
Constitutional Foundations of the Crimean Republic." It 
proposes to form a Ukrainian constitutional court with 
decision-making powers, instruct the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
chairman to ask the Constitutional Court to decide whether the 
Crimean republic's law "On the Restoration of the Constitutional 
Foundations of the Crimean Republic" accords with the 
Constitution and laws of Ukraine, advise the Supreme Council of 
Crimea to reconsider bringing the autonomy's Constitution in 
line with the Constitution and laws of Ukraine, and establish 
that the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolution of 20 May 1994 
remains valid pending a relevant judgement by the Constitutional 
Court of Ukraine. 
  A total of 58 people's deputies of Ukraine signed up to 
speak 
in the debate. In their speeches, deputies are calling for 
dissolution of the Crimean Supreme Council and suspension of its 
activities (Ivan Zayets, Vasyl Kornelyuk, Andriy Mostytskyy) and 
the introduction of direct presidential rule. Some suggest 
forming a delegation of deputies to go to Crimea to study all 
aspects of the problem, and considering interstate agreements 
between Ukraine and Russia on the inadmissibility of 
infringement of territorial integrity (Ruslan Bodelan). 
  The debate continues.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- A discussion of President Leonid 
Kravchuk's speech on the situation in the Republic of Crimea and 
on the draft resolution "On Implementing the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine's Resolution of 20 May 1994 on Suspending the Actions of 
the Law of the Republic of Crimea on Renewing the Constitutional 
Bases of Crimea's Statehood" has begun at a session of the 
Supreme Council. 
  People's Deputy Petro Osadchuk sharply criticized the draft 
resolution and noted that the document "plays into Yuriy 
Meshkov's hands" and is an example of "Kravchuk's head in the 
sand policy" over Crimea. 
  Admiral Borys Kozhyn, speaking on behalf of the Rukh 
deputies' group, noted that the Republic of Crimea should be 
transformed into a Crimea-Tatar autonomy within the composition 
of Ukraine. He criticized the president and the government 
since, in his words, they assumed the position of detached 
onlookers of events in Crimea. Borys Kozhyn proposed that the 
president should travel to Crimea together with ministers to 
"tackle the problem within the law." 
  Serhiy Kyyashko, a representative of the socialist group, 
supported Kravchuk's proposal and the draft resolution. 
  Olha Pshenychna, a deputy from Crimea and member of the 
interregional deputies' group, asked deputies "not to make any 
hasty conclusions and decisions noting that people in Crimea 
want peace and not bloodshed." She proposed that the president 
of Ukraine should seek advice from the Russian president and 
that the Supreme Council of Ukraine should seek advice from the 
Russian State Duma. 
  People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy said that he has a plan on 
how to solve the "Crimean problem" and is prepared to give it to 
the president. 
  Discussion of this issue continues.

  [Text] Kiev -- At the evening plenary sitting of the 
Supreme Council on 1 June, at which the situation in Crimea was 
considered, the resolutions offered by the president of Ukraine 
and the working commission which was drafting deputies' 
proposals, was not approved. The working group was charged with 
drafting this resolution. A resolution of the Supreme Council 
"On the implementation of the resolution by the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 `On terminating the effect of the Law 
of the Republic of Crimea,' `On the restoration of the 
constitutional fundamentals of statehood of the Republic of 
Crimea'" was approved after its new wording had been discussed. 
It indicates that the resolution by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine of 20 May 1994, in that part of it which stipulates the 
termination of the effect of the above Law of the Republic of 
Crimea, is valid. The resolution determines that the Supreme 
Council of Crimea failed to fulfill the demands stipulated by 
the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On putting 
into effect the law of Ukraine `On introducing amendments and 
additions to the Law of Ukraine,' `On the status of the 
autonomous Republic of Crimea'" of 30 June 1992 which did not 
allow to put this Law into effect. The commission for issues of 
legal policy and judicial and legal reform was charged with 
submitting in two weeks' time a resolution for the consideration 
of the Supreme Council on bringing the entire legislation of 
Crimea in line with the legislation of Ukraine. 
  The president of Ukraine, as a guarantor of the Constitution 
of Ukraine, was proposed to submit within six days a list and 
sequence of measures which stem from the Constitution and the 
current legislation of Ukraine and which can be taken by the 
bodies of state power of Ukraine. 
  Also considered at the sitting was the proposal by the 
president of Ukraine, which was contained in his message to 
parliament, on the inexpediency of holding the elections to the 
president and local self-government bodies on 26 June. 
Oleksandr Moroz submitted a draft resolution envisaging that 
postponement of the election is inexpedient. However, the 
majority of deputies were inclined to the need for more 
substantial consideration of this issue in the groups and 
commissions. Some of the deputies proposed that the 
presidential election and the election of the chairmen of the 
oblast councils be cancelled and elections at other levels be 
held. Mykhaylo Kosiv of Rukh [People's Movement of Ukraine] 
emphasized the need to introduce amendments and additions to the 
Law on local self-government before the 26 June elections and 
thus remove Leonid Kravchuk's arguments about their 
inexpediency. 
  Representatives of the communists' group supported the 
holding of elections and proposed that Leonid Kravchuk "meet the 
day of his defeat worthily." It was resolved to postpone 
consideration of this issue and the adoption of a decision on 
this issue till the morning sitting on 2 June. 
  At the request of the provisional credentials committee "in 
connection with new facts concerning the election of Volodymyr 
Hrynyov and Pavlo Kudyukin as people's deputies of Ukraine" it 
was decided to give the commission another week to ascertain the 
results of the election. During this week the commission is to 
pay a second visit to the electoral districts.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- By 241 votes for and 38 votes 
against, the Ukrainian Supreme Council approved the resolution 
"On the implementation of the resolution by the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine of 24 February 1994 on the status of the autonomous 
republic of Crimea according to the current Constitution and 
legislation of Ukraine, and the resolution by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 on suspension of the law of 
the Crimean Republic on the restoration of the Constitutional 
foundations of the Crimean Republic's statehood." 
  "The Supreme Council of Ukraine," the resolution says, 
"hereby notes that the Supreme Council of Crimea failed to 
comply with the requirements of Clauses 1-3 of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council resolution of 24 February 1994 on the status of 
the autonomous republic of Crimea according to the current 
Constitution and legislation of Ukraine, and Clause 2 of the 
resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994, and 
did not bring the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea in 
accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine within 10 days. 
Proceeding from this, and with the aim of safeguarding the 
functioning of all bodies of state power and self-government in 
Ukraine, in full accordance with the Constitution and laws of 
Ukraine and the process of consistent formation of a 
law-governed state, the Supreme Council of Ukraine hereby 
resolves: 
  1. To state that the resolution by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine of 20 May 1994, in the part concerning the suspension of 
the law of the Republic of Crimea on the restoration of 
Constitutional foundations of the Crimean republic's statehood, 
remains in force. 
  2. To acknowledge the fact that the Supreme Council of 
Crimea 
has not complied with the requirements of the resolution by the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 on enactment of the

  [Text] Kiev is 99 percent ready to introduce direct 
presidential rule in Crimea. This is the opinion of the head of 
staff of the Crimean president and government Viktor Minin. 
  In a Wednesday interview with INTERFAX Minin said that the 
situation in the peninsula is being used for a top-level power 
struggle in Kiev. 
  Minin, who met the speaker of the Ukrainian parliament 
Aleksandr Moroz several days ago, hopes that the parliament will 
not support the proposals of several politicians in Kiev to 
introduce direct presidential rule. According to him, Moroz is 
the only person in Ukraine representing the new legitimate power 
and does not want to be held responsible for the sins of the old 
leadership. 
  Several days ago Moroz spoke against presidential rule in 
Crimea. 
  Minin predicted that direct presidential rule would lead to 
confrontation between Russia and Ukraine. "Russia would either 
have to wash its hands, or react", he remarked. "If Yeltsin does 
nothing, Zhirinovskiy and the Russian military are going to 
demand either tough measures or a change of government." 
  In Minin's opinion the only reasonable way out of the crisis 
is the signing of a treaty between Ukraine and Crimea as a 
republic within Ukraine and the expansion of trade and economic 
relations between Crimea and Russia.

  [Text] Kiev 2 June TASS -- A Ukrainian parliamentary 
delegation left today for the Crimea in a bid to settle the 
dispute with this semi-autonomous republic over its latest 
decrees, which are regarded by Kiev as the first step towards 
secession. 
  "In any case, our delegation must spare no efforts in order 
to put an end to all the current negative processes in the 
Crimea. We will do our best to settle all the problems in a 
civilized manner," delegation head Vladimir Butkevich told TASS 
before departure. 
  According to the lawmaker, the delegation has received 
"broad 
powers to conduct negotiations on the whole range of disputed 
problems, including economic and juridical ones, as well as 
problems of security." 
  Butkevich stressed that the delegation will act in 
compliance 
with a parliamentary resolution stipulating that the Crimea's 
decision to reinstate the 1992 constitution was illegal and 
contradicted the laws of Ukraine. 
  The parliament asked President Kravchuk to draw up before 6 
June a list of measures which state power bodies could use 
against the Crimea in case the republic violate's the country's 
Constitution.

  [Text] Kiev, 1 Jun -- Supreme Council deputies have 
approved a protocol of instruction from the Commission on Human 
Rights, Ethnic Minorities and Interethnic Relations, while the 
Commission for Issues of Legal Policy has prepared a final 
version of the resolution on the situation in Crimea. The 
commission has started to work. 
  On 31 May, deputies elected commission chairmen as a 
package. 
As is known, only one vacant seat, that of the Commission for 
Issues of Ecological Policy, remained vacant. Today, Supreme 
Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz proposed that Ivan Zayets 
should be elected to this post. But only 156 deputies voted for 
this proposal, 13 short of the number required. 
  Leonid Kuchma made a speech at the plenary sitting. He noted 
that the main reason for the crisis in Crimea is that economic 
problems were becoming aggravated. In his words, there were no 
active anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian feelings in Crimea two 
years ago. Leonid Kuchma sees the solution in really giving 
Crimea a special status. He noted: "However, there is a limit 
beyond which we cannot go: Crimea should unambiguously be 
within the composition of Ukraine." 
  Oleksandr Moroz stressed that there are objective factors in 
the Crimean crisis, i.e. mistakes in the former USSR's policies 
and mistakes in resolving the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, and 
also subjective factors, i.e. the clash of several nationalisms 
in Crimea and the blocking of the creation of a constitutional 
court. He proposed that economic relations be unblocked and 
that the tourist season in Crimea be allowed to function 
normally.
