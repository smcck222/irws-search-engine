<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Attempts to reconcile 
Chairman of the State Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays with 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov proved futile. Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin told a press conference here today that he had 
asked First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays to 
"leave Moscow alone". 
  The approaching finish of the first stage of the Russian 
voucher privatisation has not reconciled the advocates of 
different forms and methods of this economically important 
process. Chairman of the Russian State Property Committee 
Chubays told a press conference the other day that "the great 
Russian squabble over privatisation has culminated in the 
latter's complete victory". True, he added that a fight was now 
going on over the results of privatisation. Of course, he 
himelf assesses them very highly. For instance, he believes it 
is a remarkable achievement that foreign investments were made 
in auctioned off enterprises. However, Chubays was able to 
mention only a few such instances, because the total amount of 
such investments is rather small. 
  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov is the most outspoken opponent of 
the current method of denationalisation. He claims that it was 
a total flop. During a specially called press conference here, 
he even described the current privatisation methods as a 
"forcible break-down of the state", because everything was being 
sold at dirt cheap prices, the democratic principles were being 
violated, and the rights of Russia's territories were being 
ignored. 
  The Moscow government has offered its own concept of further 
privatisation. It moves to prolong the validity of 
privatisation vouchers and to collect in a depository the unused 
privatisation cheques in order to "return to every man the part 
of the property initially promised to him". The head of the 
State Property Committee rejects both proposals. "The 
government's stand is clear: We shall not prolong the voucher 
privatisation in Russia," he stated. 
  The Moscow government plans to use its own, higher 
yardsticks 
for assessing the cost of privatised enterprises, whereas 
Chubays is mobilising his lawyers to check the legality of its 
criteria. The head of the Moscow administration warns against 
selling land on the territory subordinated to him, while the 
head of the State Property Committee is seeking legal grounds to 
privatise land. Luzhkov demands broader rights to local 
government bodies, so that they could determine themselves 
"what, when, and within what time limits they find profitable to 
sell". Chubays is ready to make only minor concessions as 
regards the sale of packages of shares for money. "What will the 
packages be like, to what extent will they be fractioned, and in 
what sequence will the sales be arranged -- all this will be 
left for the local government bodies to decide," he says. 
  All this throws light only on the major problems that are 
being disputed not only by the foregoing statesmen, but also by 
various political forces. This does not promise a peaceful life 
to those who are linked with this historical process of altering 
the form of property in a huge country. 
  Be what it may, work on the programme for the post-voucher 
privatisation is nearing completion. It is to be submitted to 
the Russian Government on June 15. The latter will forward it 
for approval to the Russian president and the State Duma. Cash 
privatisation is to begin in July. About 70 percent of all the 
Russian industrial enterprises will be sold off by then for 
privatisation vouchers. Ten percent of the enterprises will not 
be privatised at all, while the remaining 20 will be auctioned 
off for money. The packages of shares left unused at 
enterprises during the voucher privatisation will also be 
auctioned off.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report under the "Privatization" rubric: </F>
"Boris Yeltsin Asks Chubays To `Leave Moscow Alone,' Hoping the 
Other `Federation Components' Will Not Take Yuriy Luzhkov's Cue"] 
  [Text] President Yeltsin made a resolute attempt yesterday 
to end the conflict between Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and 
Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for the 
Management of State Property [Goskomimushchestvo]. He announced 
that he had let Mr. Chubays know via Oleg Soskovets "that he 
leave Moscow alone." Boris Yeltsin believes there is no danger 
of opposition to Goskomimushchestvo policy in the other regions. 
"The rest are not going to rush to do likewise," he stated at a 
press conference. 
  Meanwhile, the conflict between the Goskomimushchestvo 
chairman and the Moscow governor has been resolved only in form. 
Clearly the differences that have taken on a political nature 
will only grow with the start of the post-voucher privatization 
where denationalization of real estate and plots of land 
acquires special importance. Goskomimushchestvo Deputy Chairman 
Maksim Boyko told REUTER that Russia "should energetically move 
forward on the question of privatization of land and real 
estate," in particular to spur reforms in agriculture. More 
than that, Mr. Boyko identified the future of privatized 
enterprises with "workable bankruptcy procedures" and with their 
"complete introduction in the market sector." 
  Meanwhile, Yuriy Luzhkov described Anatoliy Chubays' 
statements about the Moscow government's retreating from its own 
privatization program as a bluff, and announced that far from 
stopping to press on with "its own" variant of 
denationalization, Moscow is going to "strengthen" its actions 
in this direction. Clearly, the Moscow authorities would not 
like to lose effective control of real estate in the capital. 
Besides, it is quite probable that the government of Mr. 
Luzhkov will come out for taking into account the special nature 
of Moscow's production facilities before "taking them into a 
market economy," that is to say, to take into account "social 
consequences," "state interests," and other such factors. 
  As for what the authorities in the other regions of Russia 
are going to do, Goskomimushchestvo chiefs can hardly take 
comfort in the Russian president's assurances. Without a doubt 
Boris Yeltsin's support of Yuriy Luzhkov's stance will be taken 
by regional bosses as a sufficient pretext for vigorous actions 
to get rid of Goskomimushchestvo tutelage. On 9 June the 
influential interregional association "Siberian Agreement" 
formulated demands to the government and the president that the 
regional interests "connected with the principles and approaches 
to privatization in the post-privatization period in Siberia" be 
taken into account. In the opinion of Leonid Polezhayev, one of 
the association's leaders, "It is necessary, before it is too 
late, to take measures in order to preserve everything that can 
be preserved taking account of the interests of the Siberian 
regions." The regional elite is clearly not going to preserve 
the role of the federal Goskomimushchestvo and follow its 
pro-market plans in effecting privatization. On the contrary, 
it wishes to retain as great a control over property as possible.

  [Text] Russian presidential aide, Georgiy Satarov, said he 
does not believe that the fact of Boris Yeltsin asking Anatoliy 
Chubays not to be in charge of privatization in Moscow forecasts 
the latter's resignation. 
  Saratov told Interfax in an interview Friday that the 
disagreement between Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov had 
only a few more weeks to run. He said that after this a new 
stage would begin and the argument would no longer be relevant. 
  The essence of the conflict between Chubays and Luzhkov is 
the latter's demand to carry out a privatization campaign in the 
city in line with a special program which is at odds with 
nationwide legislation. This would help the Moscow authorities 
to increase the price of real estate. Chubays believes Moscow 
facilities should be privatized in line with the nationwide 
scheme without any special conditions. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Friday, Boris 
Yeltsin 
said that as the two sides could not agree, he had decided that 
privatization in Moscow should proceed according to a special 
program which would not be applied to other areas of the country.

  [Text] [Announcer Mikhail Zotov] A news conference took 
place in the government building on Krasnaya Presnya in Moscow 
today. Its theme was the intensification of the fight against 
crime which the power ministries are planning in the near future. 
  Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of the Security Council, 
said that the benefit gained from the additional anti-crime 
measures, calculated according to UN methods, should be about 10 
trillion rubles. Five trillion rubles will be spent on the 
measures themselves, and the Security Council will oversee the 
conduct of the campaign. 
  Aleksey Ilyushenko, acting procurator general, said that the 
procuracy would coordinate this work. In view of the provisions 
of the draft law on the fight against crime which permit the 
Interior Ministry to introduce agents into commercial structure, 
to create sham firms, and to work with securities, journalists 
raised the question of corruption. Viktor Yerin replied to this: 
  [Begin Yerin recording] We have special structural units 
which directly and on their own initiative engage in operational 
work among their own personnel, revealing unscrupulous people. 
[end recording] 
  [Zotov] And although Viktor Yerin considers that one must 
not 
violate the law oneself while fighting illegality, the 
participants in the news conference on intensifying the fight 
against crime were unanimously of the opinion that if the 
legislation was not in accord with the necessary measures to 
combat crime, it must be changed. 
  Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service, pointed out to those assembled 
that the counter-intelligence service was restoring its 
investigative apparatus and that about 800 experienced personnel 
had already returned. 
  [Begin Stepashin recording] The president gave the go-ahead 
and draft decrees are now being prepared by [word indistinct] 
together with us, and these decrees on creating a directorate of 
active operations will be signed, most likely next week. It is 
rather broader than the Vympel group. It will be a directorate 
not only of the central apparatus but will also operate in a 
number of regions, in particular in St. Petersburg, in 
Krasnodar, in Yekaterinburg, in Novosibirsk, and in Murmansk.

  [Text] Moscow June 13 TASS -- The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) is setting up an active 
operations division to step up struggle against crime, FCIS 
director Sergey Stepashin said at a news conference at the 
government building here on Monday. 
  The division will be established not only at the central 
office. It will also have its branches in big Russian cities, 
including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. 
  According to the director, these changes are provided for by 
the federal programme for stepping up struggle against crime for 
1994-1995. The FCIS is vested with new, but, in actual fact, 
old forgotten functions, including the return of investigative 
bodies. 
  In the near future, some 700-800 investigators having 
experience of work in security bodies will get down to work at 
the service. 
  In Stepashin's opinion, clear-cut and efficient cooperation 
between his service, on the one hand, and the law enforcement 
bodies, the security service of banks, currency exchange points, 
tax investigation service and, if need be, the president's 
security service as well as other interested structures, on the 
other, will help to implement successfully the federal programme 
for stepping up struggle against crime.

<F P=106> [Igor Korolkov report: "MVD Organs Bring Criminal Case </F>
Against Accused Who Testified in Court About Human Rights 
Violation"] 
  [Excerpts] IZVESTIYA published the article "Torture Used 
in Russian Detention Centers, Claim Defendants in Case before 
Moscow City Court" 25 February this year. One of the people 
quoted by IZVESTIYA was Aleksandr Morozov. A criminal case has 
been brought against him. 
  In the four and a half years' investigation and judicial 
examination Morozov has repeatedly tried to draw the attention 
of detention center management, the Prosecutor's Office, and the 
courts to the numerous violations of the law governing 
investigations and to the inhuman conditions under which people 
are detained at these centers. Protesting a violation of the 
law in the conduct of the case, Morozov went on hunger strike -- 
as a result of which, he claims, his arms and legs started to 
wither away. Investigator Kharchenko thought that the accused 
was faking illness and sent him to the USSR Academy of Medical 
Sciences' Neurology Scientific Research Institute. There, 
Morozov claims, strong electric shocks were administered to him 
against his will. 
  Investigator Kharchenko called on the Moscow Prosecutor's 
Office to bring a criminal case against Morozov. Since Morozov, 
the investigator believes, was to all intents and purposes 
accusing him of using torture, he termed the accused's testimony 
slanderous and "combined with accusations of the commission of a 
state or other serious crime" under Article 130 Section III. 
The statement was sent to the 108th militia precinct, which was 
charged with carrying out the interrogation. [passage omitted] 
  Morozov has submitted around 600 complaints, statements, and 
petitions. Neither the Prosecutor's Office nor the courts have 
yet checked out the facts set out by the accused, even though he 
has continually pressed for it. But, as soon as the MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] investigator who was mentioned in 
the accused's statement submitted his own statement, criminal 
proceedings were immediately instituted. That is a more than 
eloquent fact! 
  I would recall that, after the IZVESTIYA article, the State 
Duma set up a parliamentary commission to look into the facts 
set out in the newspaper about the violation of human rights at 
Russian detention centers as a whole. The powerful departments 
whose interests were attacked in the article are well aware of 
the dangers of such checks. As we have already reported, a 
highly placed MVD staffer phoned the commission chairman to 
express resolute dissatisfaction with the creation of the 
commission. We must assume that this is why efforts are being 
made to discredit witnesses.

upon by the leader of Russia's Choice movement, Yegor Gaydar at 
the opening of the Russia's Choice founding congress today, will

who is a delegate to the congress. 
  "After the situation stabilizes, after regions give their 
full support, it will be possible to take more resolute and 
tough steps," he said. He pointed out that the course of 
resolving problems by the president's decrees will be continued. 
  In reply to a question asked by ITAR-TASS, Filatov pointed 
out that he is a delegate of the congress and was one of the 
party's organisers at the first stage of its creation. But it's 
too early to speak about membership in the party yet, since 
practically, it has not yet been created, he said. 
  According to Filatov, the president did not express his 
attitude to the newly created party on the eve of its founding 
congress.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia's First Vice-Premier 
Oleg Soskovets told a conference in the Kremlin today that his 
vision of the state of the national economy was far from rosy. 
  He pointed to notable changes in the economic situation in 
Russia in the first months of this year, characterized by a 
further slump in production concomitant with the slow-down in 
the rate of growth of inflation, higher unemployment and demand 
constraints. No growth of accumulation was recorded in the use 
of the gross domestic product, and while the crediting and 
monetary policy grew tougher, tension increased in the financial 
state of enterprises. The amount of outstanding debts to 
suppliers kept growing in relation to the monetary resources on 
the accounts of industrial and construction enterprises and the 
non-payment crises showed no signs of abatement. 
  Soskovets stressed that the share of loss-making and idling 
enterprises in the industry as a whole kept growing, and the 
industrial production slump from January to May went 25 period 
[as received] deeper from the same period last year. The 
reduction in production was the deepest in the processing 
industry and consumer goods production. 
  Soskovets said the slump in production was no longer due to 
the severance of former economic ties but to demand constraints 
and structural factors, as well as to the shortage of money at 
the disposal of customers. "Stocks of manufactured goods are 
swelling, mass-scale production has to be stopped or curtailed 
at a large number of enterprises, which results in the reduction 
not only of effective but also of physical demand and in the 
accelerated spread of paralysis along technological chains," the 
vice-premier said. 
  Soskovets stressed however that far from all enterprises 
were 
in a crisis. Many of them has adapted to the new conditions of 
economic management, accumulated rouble and hard currency 
reserves, and are delaying remittances of resources to the 
accounts of their suppliers not because they lack money but 
because they seek additional profits. 
  The reduction in the volume of production continued in many 
regions of Russia, Soskovets said. Out of the 21 republics 
within the Russian Federation only Karelia, Komi, Kalmykia and 
Yakutia registered the reduction in output by less than 20 
percent. The situation remains extremely complicated in the 
regions where processing industries and industries producing 
means of production prevail. These are the Central, Volga and 
Ural regions, and some parts of the northern, northwestern and 
eastern Siberian economic regions. 
  The pursuance of the policy of the macroeconomic 
stabilization has brought to light a number of problems which 
have been accumulating in the economy for a long time. One of 
the most serious among them is that reforms have not affected 
the technological structure of production: most enterprises have 
been unable to cut the cost of production, particularly in 
conditions of a tougher competition with foreign producers on 
the domestic market. 
  As concerns the social sphere, Oleg Soskovets said "certain 
positive shifts" have taken place there since the beginning of 
the year. Measures were taken to increase wages and monetary 
incomes and improve the provision of pensions. Along with this, 
the differentiation in society has continued to increase, and 
the situation on the labour market grew increasingly worrisome. 
Although formally the level of unemployment in the country 
remains quite low at 1.7 percent of the economically active 
population, "the dynamics of this process is growing".

  [Text] On Friday Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a 
decree on the banking system in Russia. The president's press 
service has issued the full text of the decree. 
  The decree states that the restrictions included in the 
first 
section of the presidential decree on banks of November 17, 1993 
do not affect operations with Russian residents if these 
operations are specified in licences granted by the Russian 
Central Bank up to the issuing of the decree to foreign banks or 
banks with joint capital set up on Russian territory by banks 
from countries with which Russia has concluded agreements on 
investment encouragement and protection. 
  The president agreed with the suggestion of the Central Bank 
on granting licences to carry out banking operations to foreign 
and joint banks if foreign states grant Russian banks similar 
conditions in their activities abroad. 
  The president recommends that the Central Bank increase its 
supervision of the work of commercial banks, credit 
organizations and carries out thorough investigations of their 
activities no less than once every two years. The Central Bank 
has been given three months to work out and present to the 
government suggestions on developing consumer credit. 
  The Central Bank has also been charged with accelerating the 
pace of setting up a fund for protecting the money of citizens 
invested in Russian banks. 
  The decree stipulates that investments can be guaranteed by 
the state at the expense of this fund in cases set down in 
Russian law. 
  The president spoke in favor of adopting new banking laws to 
secure the mutual representation of the government and the 
Central Bank in order to carry out agreed measures on carrying 
out credit and monetary policy. 
  The decree also lays down that the Central Bank will take 
part in government sessions while the finance and economics 
minsters will take part in sessions of the Council of Directors 
of the Central Bank. 
  Laws and actions by organs of state power disrupting the 
unity of the system of the Central Bank are declared 
inadmissible. The document states that the Central Bank is a 
federal bank and according to the Russian Constitution its 
actions are regulated exclusively by federal organs of state 
power.

  [Text] The authorized strength of the Russian Armed Forces 
would be 1.9 million by 1 October 1994, Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev told Interfax. 
  At present, the authorized strength of the Russian Armed 
Forces is 2.2 million. 
  Grachev noted that it was not only the rank-and-file and 
officer corps which were to be cut -- general officers were to 
be cut, too. He said that 270 generals' posts would be cut by 
the end of the year.

warheads brought to Russia from the territory of CIS countries 
in Central Asia, the Transcaucasus, Belarus, and Ukraine have 
been dismantled, our correspondent was told by Vitaliy Yakovlev,

  [Text] When President Yeltsin travels to the Far East on 
June 14, he may take a decision to build a Russian space center 
at Svobodny 18, a town in the Amur region. 
  A spokesman for the Aero-Space Army Command disclosed to 
Interfax on Saturday that Yeltsin, scheduled to visit Kyzyl, 
Tuva (a republic within the Russian Federation) and 
Blagoveschensk (the Amur region), would also go to Svobodny 18 
for an on the spot decision on the construction of a space 
center there. 
  He revealed that essential documents were currently being 
drafted at the government's request to explain the need for such 
a Far Eastern project. 
  At Svobodny 18, a town where a strategic missile division 
was 
once deployed, intensive work is underway to refurbish the 
facilities. Launch sites are being remodelled there for small 
aircraft of a Rokot type. 
  As the Aero-Space Force Commander Vladimir Ivanov has 
reported, the first Rokot is to be launched in 1996 from one of 
the five silos that has remained after the disbandment of the 
division in line with START. 
  Subsequently, a new complex is to be built at Svobodny 18 
for 
an Angara-24 heavy booster, which will be superior to the 
currently used Proton rocket since it is less polluting and can 
launch heavier loads to orbit.

  [Text] Mission Control Centre June 10 TASS -- Russian 
cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev, Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov 
have spent five months on board the "Mir" complex. 
  They devoted primary attention to geophysical studies this 
week, which were carried out with the help of a multizonal 
MKF-6MA camera and videospectrometric equipment, installed on 
the "Kvant-2" module. Today, the cosmonauts are to make a 
regular series of photographs of the earth's surface. They will 
also carry out several experiments to determine the spectral 
characteristics of major oceanic currents and to further study 
the ionosphere and the earth's magnetosphere. 
  Astrophysical studies were carried out regularly in recent 
days with the use of the international "roentgen" orbital 
observatory. The telescopes were trained on the centre of our 
galaxy, at the roentgen pulsar, the power of whose radiation 
grew approximately 10-fold at the beginning of May. 
  Medical examinations show that the cosmonauts are in good 
health. The flight is proceeding normally.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 111 (601); </F>
compiled by reporters Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; 
and edited by Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has submitted to 
parliament proposals on measures that are to be taken if the 
Crimean parliament fails to make the Republic's laws in line 
with the Ukrainian Constitution. The statement was made to 
INTERFAX-Ukraine by the spokesman for the president Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko. However, he refused to specify what concrete 
measures the president wants to take. IF Note: Kravchuk 
fulfilled the decision adopted by parliament on 1 June about the 
drafting of a list of measures which may be used by Ukraine's 
state organs if Crimean law-makers cancel the laws which run 
counter to the Ukrainian Constitution. It is a matter of the 
Crimean decision to reinstate the Constitution adopted in 6 May 
1992, which provides for dual citizenship for the inhabitants of 
the peninsula and the relationships between the Crimea and 
Ukraine based on agreements. Following the results of the talks 
in Simferopol of 2-3 June the delegations of the Ukrainian and 
Crimean parliaments signed a communique where they fixed the 
mutual "understanding" of the fact that the Crimean Constitution 
of 6 May 1992 has provisions, which run counter to the Ukrainian 
legislation. It was decided to create a joint working group to 
improve Ukrainian legislation concerning the division of powers 
between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Crimea. 
The group started activities in Simferopol on Thursday [9 June]. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, the Ukrainian co-leader of 
the 
group, Vladimir Stretovich said that political problems will not 
be included in the discussion. We will use legal ways to find 
acceptable reservations which will reinstate the Crimean 
status-quo, he said. 
  Stretovich said that the group consists of lawyers who will 
study the Crimean and Ukrainian legislations from the 
professions point of view. 
  The use of force in the conflict is inadmissible unless all 
negotiating method are used. This is the position of the 
Ukrainian parliament, said the deputy. 
  Meanwhile, the head of the delegation of the Crimean 
parliament Sergey Nikulin in an interview with INTERFAX said 
that Simferopol will try to use legal means to solve the current 
situation in such a way so that the relations between Ukraine 
and the Crimea be based on principles of agreements as it was 
said in the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. 
  We do not pose the question of the Crimea's secession from 
Ukraine. We want to have Russia to be as open to us as Ukraine 
is, said the Crimean deputy.

  [Text] Friday [10 June] evening the Crimean parliament's 
delegation from the joint working group submitted to the 
Ukrainian side a draft agreement between Ukraine and the Crimea. 
  The draft consists of three parts: powers the Crimea 
delegates to Kiev; powers Ukraine can delegate to the Crimea; 
and common powers, the leader of the Crimean delegation, Sergey 
Nikulin, told Interfax-Ukraina on Saturday [11 June]. 
  Nikulin gave no details as to the content of the three 
parts. 
According to him, during their round of talks which was 
concluded in Simferopol on Friday "the two sides did not even 
try to consider those articles of the Crimean Constitution that 
do not suit Ukraine." 
  "The Crimean delegation declared that the Crimean 
Constitution will not be revised," he noted. 
  The final protocol signed by the leaders of the Ukrainian 
and 
Crimean delegations reflects the outlook of the Crimean side 
which believes that it's essential to work out constitutional 
foundations for dividing powers between the highest government 
bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea." 
  According to the document, solution to the "constitutional 
and legislative collisions" between Kiev and Simferopol should 
be reached in three stages: "work out an appropriate legal base, 
devise a legal mechanism for eliminating contradictions between 
the Crimea and Ukraine, and prepare recommendations for the 
Crimean and Ukrainian parliaments." 
  The working group believes that only the first stage has 
been 
completed so far, and insists that the work should be continued. 
Members of the group also think that representatives of the 
Crimean parliament should take part in drafting Ukraine's new 
constitution. 
  Saturday morning the Ukrainian delegation left for Kiev. The 
joint group may resume its work in Kiev next week.

  [Excerpt] A Crimean parliamentary delegation handed to the 
Ukrainian side a draft treaty on the relations between the 
Republic of Crimea and Ukraine. The draft treaty stipulates, in 
particular, the delimitation of powers between the state power 
bodies of Crimea and Ukraine. 
  Meanwhile, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian 
president, said that he rules out the establishment of treaty 
(?wise) relations with the Crimean peninsula -- a Ukrainian 
entity. In his interview for the Interfax news agency he 
stressed that the legislature of the Crimean Republic is to be 
brought into compliance with the Ukrainian legislation.

<F P=106> [Report by Oksana Hutsul: "Crimea. What Will Come of It?"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Here is how deputies commented 
on the Crimean problem behind the scenes. 
  Anton Buteyko: The Ukrainian Supreme Council has the right 
to dictate its will and should do this, while other entities 
must obey. Crimea is an entity subordinated to Ukraine. In a 
situation like the one that has recently developed in Crimea, 
which can be qualified as a violation of territorial integrity 
and national sovereignty, the law "On State of Emergency" 
provides a solution. The introduction of that law is also 
envisioned by international laws, however UN bodies have to be 
informed about such intentions in an appropriate manner. I do 
not think that we should resort to these measures now, however 
such a possibility should not be ruled out. 
  The draft law suggested by the president is just another 
postponement, while we are expected to make concrete steps. 
  Leonid Kuchma: The essence of the Crimean issue lies in the 
economy and not in politics. I am an advocate of negotiations 
and vaster economic independence. Look what is going on in 
Crimea: The adoption of a soft tax policy has caused an inflow 
of capital. According to my data, more than 600 billion 
karbovantsi have recently been transferred to Crimea by means of 
Ukraine's commercial banks. Crimea should suspend its decision 
regarding the constitution, while the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
should adopt a ban on the use of force. With regard to the 
proposals to create the Constitutional Court -- can our 
legislature create it? In our state politics is ahead of the 
economy. Ukraine is actually approaching collapse, because with 
an economic plunge of 50 percent (this is how production has 
shrunk in Ukraine's light industries), states usually 
disintegrate. 
  Borys Oliynyk: The Crimean issue should be resolved by means 
of the Constitutional Court. However a limited period of time 
should be set aside for forming this court. I do not think that 
anybody would dare blame us for failure to do everything in our 
power to peacefully resolve the conflict. Introduction of 
presidential rule in Crimea is out of the question; we should 
act in line with the logic of our resolution. However we must 
determine certain time limits for a response from Crimean 
authorities.

  [Text] The economic and political situation in Ukraine are 
both developing with difficulty. However, this difficulty, 
thank God, does not go beyond the framework of laws and the 
Constitution. Within the framework of legislation and the 
Constitution, we coordinate all of the issues connected with 
interparty passions and with interparty struggle, as well as 
regional issues--in particular, the Crimean issue, a very 
complicated issue for us today. We work in a way so that Crimea 
can understand that simple norm, recognized by the world 
community, that it has no right to violate the territorial 
integrity of the state and alter its borders. We enjoy the 
support of the entire international community. 
  I hope that the Crimean leadership will assume 
responsibility 
in order to bring the processes within the framework of the 
Constitution. I, as the president of Ukraine, and the government 
act this way. We shall continue to act this way and tackle all 
issues proceeding from law and the Constitution. However, I 
emphasize again that the Crimean leadership has no right to step 
over the red line, which I mention. This is a violation of our 
state's territorial integrity. Well, I cannot say that we have a 
full understanding with Crimea. The problems are very 
complicated, but the information that is available to me, and I 
would like to share it with you, proves that there is a growing 
understanding among people--not at some level of power 
structures, but among people--and that the policy conducted by 
the Crimean leadership can lead to complications. Such 
understanding does exist. People, seeing these problems, these 
hotbeds, as we call them--both Karabakh and the Dniestr region, 
where it also happened, and Yugoslavia today. Thank God, the 
issue is being somehow tackled today. It can be solved step by 
step in Abkhazia where blood is being shed, where innocent 
people, women and children and those who have nothing to do with 
these conflicts, die and become refugees. People see this, and 
I think it will influence the Crimean leadership's policy and 
the actions. For our part, our actions will be adequate for the 
situation; however, we will by no means allow the territorial 
integrity and inviolability of Ukraine's borders to be violated. 
We say this openly and sincerely, and I am telling you this 
while I am aware of the fact that the Crimean issue is a painful 
issue for every person living today in Ukraine. 
  We have been able to follow the road of peace, tranquility, 
and accord, although there is certain pressure exerted on us 
from outside. We have internal problems as well. So far we 
have been unable to achieve civil accord as far as building and 
developing our economy, our political and power structures, and 
power institutions are concerned. 
  The previous Supreme Council had been working for four 
years. 
It failed to solve issues that needed to be solved at the 
constitutional level. It failed to adopt the Constitution. 
Ukraine is one of the few countries of the former USSR which 
has no constitution today. We are going to hold the elections 
without a constitution. We are going to hold the elections 
without relevant laws to regulate relations between the local 
and central bodies of power. We are going to hold the elections 
with no clear idea of the plenary powers of the bodies of power 
to be elected and the structure of that power; no idea of what 
will be its responsibility to the budget of Ukraine or the 
responsibility of the lower-level bodies of power to the 
higher-level bodies of power. We have no idea whether that 
vertical subordination system exists or does not exist. Today, 
we see that it can be destroyed. This will seriously endanger 
the arrangement of power in the state, and power is the lever by 
which all institutions in all areas of life are created: in 
legal, economic, political, and diplomatic areas, and so on. 
That is to say, we must have constitutional and legislative 
norms to hold the elections, and we are going to hold them 
without those norms. This is unique, and it is not by chance 
that at the Supreme Council I appealed to the deputies and told 
them that today they.... [Kravchuk pauses] because this is 
exclusively within the competence of the Supreme Council to 
create the structure and to pass the laws on both the power 
structure and the elections. 
  The president has no such plenary powers. Therefore, the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine will naturally have to assume all 
responsibility for what we are doing today toward that end. I 
believe that the deputies understand this, and there is no 
exaggeration whatsoever at this point. Perhaps we shall 
manage--I mean at the Supreme Council they will manage--before 
the elections are held, to make some corrections and some 
amendments to the laws that will regulate relations and create 
the power structure. 
  As you know, there will be presidential elections, too. 
Strictly speaking, these elections, if we had a new constitution 
and laws.... [Kravchuk pauses] I was then speaking at the 
Supreme Council and saying that it is true that new power 
institutions had to be created to comply with the new 
constitution. But if this is not done, I am convinced that 
these elections will not bring better conditions or big changes 
in the economy and in politics all of a sudden. On the 
contrary, they distract people from fulfilling their [word 
indistinct]. 
  I will use my own activities to illustrate this. This is the 
seventh election during the past four years that I have run in. 
Just imagine, the seventh election over four years. This means 
that I have been elected twice a year. Not appointed, but 
elected by people. This is the situation, and effort and energy 
are spared toward that end. [sentence as heard] 
  For example, I am a functioning president, and I cannot 
abandon my office duties today. Who will perform them for me? 
There is no vice president. The Constitution clearly 
stipulates that I have no right to pass my powers to anyone 
else. For example, if I go on a trip to some oblast, and the 
levers of power.... [Kravchuk pauses] And it is necessary to 
sign documents here, or to meet representatives of other states 
who visit Ukraine. 
  For example, next Tuesday [14 June] I am to fly to 
Luxembourg 
to sign a document on partnership and cooperation between 
Ukraine and the European Union. This will be done for the first 
time ever, and by this I mean to say that those who claim that 
Ukraine conducts a policy of isolation, self-isolation, well, 
this is just untrue because Ukraine has been recognized by the 
whole world. If we said earlier that it was recognized by 50, 
60, or 70 states, then today I say that the whole world has 
recognized Ukraine. 
  Ukraine joins the European community, the European Union 
with 
the rights of a partner. This is a fact, and this will be done 
next Tuesday on 14 June. 
  We signed the most important political and economic 
documents 
with Russia and other CIS countries. We signed a treaty on 
friendship and cooperation with Russia in 1990. A new, 
full-scale treaty between our states is being prepared now, and 
I hope that it will be signed after we solve yet another acute 
problem for Russia and Ukraine: the division and the status of 
the Black Sea Fleet. We have also made some progress here. 
  Therefore, the fact that Ukraine conducts some policy of 
isolation or self-isolation is a pure invention, indeed, a 
deliberate invention. 
  Ukraine is represented at international organizations. 
Official representatives of other states, including high-level 
representatives, visit Ukraine every day. You know, Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel recently visited Ukraine. I mention 
the recent times. Is this self-isolation? Another thing is 
that the problems are solved in an acute manner and with 
difficulty. However, this is not our fault, or it would be more 
correct to say, not only our fault. There are problems in other 
states, and it is not easy to solve them, and everyone today is 
engaged in solving acute issues. Sometimes we have to act as a 
fire-fighting team instead of implementing a program step by 
step and consistently, a program which neither internal nor 
external factors influence seriously, but even if they do, these 
factors can be easily averted.

  [Text] Ukraine may soon be a leading exporter of its most 
sophisticated weapons, says the report by the analytical center 
of the election team of the candidate for presidency Ivan 
Plushch, which was released in Kiev on Sunday [12 June]. 
  The document says the most promising export item may be the 
Kharkov-produced tank T-84 which surpasses in performance 
characteristics, western tanks and the Russian one, T-80. 
  Experts believe that Ukrainian submarines, air defence 
missile systems and missile complexes for Navy have good export 
characteristics. 
  Analysts believe, in 1995 Ukraine plans to start the 
production of a new submachine gun on the basis of the 
Kalashnikov. It surpasses the base model by many parameters. 
  The document says that Asia may be the most promising market 
for Ukrainian armaments. In this respect, Ukraine may be 
interested in the proposal by the Indian company, Resources 
Argumentation, which is prepared to give Ukraine a long-term 
credit for the development of the Ukrainian industry.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk said in the western city 
of Lvov that did not know what the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's 
Presidium or parliamentary groups thought about the candidates 
for premiership. 
  He emphasized the need to have the nominations thoroughly 
discussed and a final choice made. 
  Sources close to the leadership of the Ukrainian parliament 
said that the presidium had decided to ask Vitaly Masol to 
present his program. 
  He was nominated for premiership by Kravchuk. Prime minister 
before 1992, Masol was pensioned off. 
  Kravchuk said in Lvov he would explain his platform in a 
national radio address late on 13 June, nearly two weeks before 
the presidential elections.

Mikhail Melnik, and Galina Nekrasova] 
  [Excerpts] Lvov, 12 Jun -- Today, for the first time, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk unveiled his program for the 
26 June presidential elections during a working trip to Lvov 
Oblast. 
  At a meeting at Lvov Polytechnic State University with 
representatives of the authorities of the western region of 
Ukraine, businessmen, the intelligentsia, and clergy, Leonid 
Kravchuk spoke of the main tenets of his program. Its main 
thesis is "to strengthen the state and speed up the reforms 
through civic accord." He sees his main task as head of 
government as ensuring that "the economic reforms get going and 
that people begin to live better lives," that Ukraine's state 
construction moves ahead. 
  Speaking of the Crimean problem, Leonid Kravchuk stressed 
that "no matter how events develop, Ukraine will not allow the 
territorial integrity of the state, its unity, to be violated. 
Regardless of what the Supreme Council, the government, the 
president of the Crimean autonomous entity do, everything will 
be done to ensure that events on the peninsula do not spill over 
the bounds of the Constitution of Ukraine. There can be no 
alternative here." [passage omitted] 
  During his trip today Leonid Kravchuk unveiled a monument in 
Lvov's central boulevard to Mikhail Grushevskiy who, in 1917-18, 
was the first president of the Ukrainian People's Republic. 
  The president of Ukraine left for Kiev in the evening.

  [Text] On 8 June at a news conference held in Lvov, 
Oleksandr Yemets, minister for issues of nationalities and 
immigration (who is running in the Supreme Council elections in 
Lvov's Halytskyy constituency supported by the "Nova Khvylya" 
coalition) addressed the issue of presidential elections. 
  Oleksandr Yemets said that candidates whom he would like to 
support (for example, Lanovyy), unfortunately, do not have any 
chances. The only possible competition is the one between 
Kravchuk and Kuchma. The nationalities minister stated that he 
is ready to support any candidate capable of countering Kuchma. 
"Although I have a great number of critical remarks regarding 
Kravchuk, the current situation is that no one but he can do 
that," Oleksandr Yemets said. 
  The same position was voiced last week by People's Deputy 
Taras Stetskiv, one of the "Nova Khvylya" leaders, in an 
interview with VYSOKYY ZAMOK.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- At a news conference 
by leaders of the "Ukraine" democratic association on 9 June, 
Dmytro Pavlychko, elected as the association's chairman on 1 
June, stated that at present the forces of the "right" had their 
candidates in 73 of the 113 constituencies where the elections 
to the Supreme Council of Ukraine are to be held on 24 July, all 
of whom will be granted the association's material and moral 
support. He admitted that to do this will be difficult as the 
national democrats have been accused by the "leftists" in the 
course of the pre-election campaign of causing the country-wide 
economic crisis and the impoverishment of the people, and a 
similar situation might recur. Dmytro Pavlychko underlined that 
he only agreed to take charge of the association after the 
People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh, NRU] pledged it had no 
intention of seceding from the bloc. 
  Dmytro Pavlychko, Oleksandr Lavrynovych (people's deputy, 
Rukh), Pavlo Movchan (people's deputy, "Statehood" grouping), 
Volodymyr Klymchuk (chairman, Liberal Democratic Party of 
Ukraine), and others who took part in the news conference 
emphasized that to the national democrats, today "the issue of 
primary importance is parliamentary elections, rather than that 
of the presidential election in Ukraine," as the forces of the 
"right" oppose a presidential election altogether. 
  As for supporting a particular candidacy, it was stated that 
so far, the national democrats lack a common point of view and 
it is likely that they will continue to lack one in the period 
before 26 June [presidential election date]. In Oleksandr 
Lavrynovych's words, the decision to support a particular 
candidacy will be made by NRU regional branches. Dmytro 
Pavlychko told the news conference that as the result of 
analyzing the candidates' pre-election platforms, there is no 
candidacy among those nominated that would satisfy the forces of 
the "right" entirely. "By way of politically dreaming," in 
Dmytro Pavlychko's words, the current situation is optimal: that 
is, Leonid Kravchuk is president and all his opponents in the 
pre-election contest, except for Leonid Kuchma, are members of 
the government. 
  It was stated at the news conference that the "Ukraine" 
democratic association will seek the agreement of Ivan Plyushch, 
Volodymyr Lanovyy, Valeriy Babych, and Petro Talanchuk to 
withdraw their candidacies in favor of Leonid Kravchuk, as "it 
is Kravchuk alone who can hold out against Kuchma" on the 
condition that all democratic forces unite. 
  It was announced at the news conference that Levko 
Lukyanenko 
[former head of the association] left the leadership of the 
association "for personal reasons" and he will not stand in the 
elections on 24 July. Mykhayo Horyn [chairman of the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, URP] added that Levko Lukyanenko would pursue 
a political career in the URP.

  [Text] On the eve of Leonid Kravchuk's visit to west 
Ukraine, its press came out in support for him as a presidential 
candidate. Kravchuk's tour of the Lvov Oblast is beginning 
today, two weeks before the election. Ukrainian political 
analysts are wondering why the nationalistic oblast, which only 
three years ago pledged its allegiance to Vyacheslav Chornovyl 
-- Kravchuk's opponent at the first presidential election -- is 
now supporting Kravchuk in the same way. 
  Is this a desire to spite the eastern area, which wants 
close 
cooperation with its Russian neighbor or do they now see 
Kravchuk as a nationalist patriot number one? 
  Significantly, as a part of his pre-election tour, Kravchuk 
today opened in Lvov city center a monument to Mikhail 
Grushevskiy, the first Ukrainian president of 1918, a historian 
and a politician who declared the country's independence. 
  Thus the incumbent will raise his popularity even more. 
Local leaders believe that Galichina [historical name of the 
Lvov area] should again assume the historic role of the state's 
savior. Leonid Kravchuk is the one at the forefront here.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "The `Great Seven' at </F>
the Finish of the Presidential Marathon"] 
  [Text] The presidential elections, in addition to their 
direct results (after all, we will have a new guarantor of our 
statehood), will become a universal sociological survey of 
Ukrainian citizens' moods, particularly during the first round, 
since everybody will have the opportunity to elect a suitable 
man. Only Lanovyy and Babych seem to be similar to each other; 
Plyushch, Kuchma, Moroz, Talanchuk, and, of course, the current 
president can be easily distinguished one from another. 
  It is impossible to analyze the candidates' chances of being 
elected for the highest state office without reviewing the 
latest steps taken by our heroes. 
<H5>  Leonid Kravchuk </H5>
  Obviously, he has recently met with misfortune. There was a 
time when Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] lived in three dimensions 
-- simultaneously, he would state that it is impossible for him 
to personally participate in the presidential race, insist on 
the need to postpone the presidential elections, and collect 
signatures as a presidential candidate -- which is the 
elementary behavior of a politician for whom power is above 
everything. Since the elections will be held anyway, even after 
numerous "appeals by company staffs" and during "the battle for 
crops" and "the winter-summer period of production," Leonid 
Makarovych has begun to "flex his muscles," and, undoubtedly, he 
will offer citizens a whole range of diplomatic successes and 
market-oriented speeches, award farm workers, disclose some 
unlucky Mafioso, stigmatize separatists, publish a book about 
fertile blacklands and colorful placards with his autographs, 
and, in general, he will do a lot of pleasing things which are 
so characteristic of him. Currently, there is a "time of work" 
for Kravchuk, and his victory is not as obvious as it was in 
1990, since the following man has become a destabilizer in his 
triumphant march: 
<H5>  Ivan Plyushch </H5>
  Even though the two men still shake hands publicly, the 
straightforward Ivan Stepanovych [Plyushch] has recently stated 
that he had "a secular" conversation with Leonid Makarovych, 
explaining that, as he understands the word, "secularism" is 
when one says what should be said, but not what one thinks. 
Plyushch is currently trying to outmaneuver the president in 
everything, since after the defeat of the faithful-to-him 
Durdynets [former Supreme Council deputy chairman], he is 
running the risk of losing his hard-earned influence. The 
conflict between the "ideologists" and the "economists" within 
the nomenklatura has reached its apogee, which, on the other 
hand, shows that the nomenklatura has definitely been 
nationalized -- it also has two hetmans now. Plyushch has 
undergone some unusual metamorphoses: While taking advantage of 
his image of economic leader, Ivan Stepanovych does not forget 
to react to political junctures in time, having temporarily 
mutated into a federalist. His latest statements, including the 
one in which he said that he is ready to personally head the 
government in the event of his victory, show that Ivan 
Stepanovych has bet everything on the presidential office, which 
suggests that he has probably done his "homework" on the eve of 
elections. Although Plyushch does not forget about his voters 
(the majority of whom live in Galicia and rural areas), due to 
the activeness of Oleksandr Moroz, his successor in parliament, 
the main battle will take place on Leonid Kuchma's territory. 
<H5>  Oleksandr Moroz </H5>
  Every day, he increases his chances in the presidential 
battle, and the main question is whether he will manage to win 
enough popularity, during the short time remaining, to be 
elected. 
  His election as Supreme Council speaker increased his 
chances 
in the battle for deputy seat. For people who are secretly 
longing for "the good old times," he is attractive, because he 
is promising to base his position on "creatively modified" 
Marxism, and he does not repel all the others, since, after all, 
he supports independence and speaks in Ukrainian. 
  Moroz has a pretty good chance to lure voters who have not 
yet defined their positions, and who like the new speaker's 
manners. Moroz has yet another advantage. Unlike all the other 
candidates, he does not complain, but proposes. A whimpering 
image is represented by another candidate: 
<H5>  Leonid Kuchma </H5>
  The former prime minister has significantly "marked down" 
his 
pro-Russian stance, and he is consistently trying to straddle 
the line between "independence" and "healthy pragmatism," which 
is not a very easy thing to do, since people want to obtain 
unequivocal answers to unequivocal questions. Apparently, 
Kuchma is the only one who is not working to alter his image, 
stubbornly sticking to the line of sad economist, who was 
rejected by "someone" wrong. Due to the campaign against 
Kuchma, conducted by all of his foes, Kuchma may lose some of 
his votes. As everybody knows, concerned over this campaign, 
Kuchma has met with the Rukh leadership, and as one of the 
participants in this meeting claims, he has even promised Rukh 
certain key positions in the future government. 
  After the defeat of the Interregional Bloc of Reforms in the 
elections and refusal to recognize the deputy powers of 
Volodymyr Hrynyov, Leonid Kuchma is in need of new partners. 
However, due to the peculiarities of his nature, Kuchma has a 
gift to lose political allies without gaining new friends. For 
many of his potential voters, he still remains a man who 
"promised a lot, but did not do anything," and for those who 
still try to think independently, the following man is much more 
attractive: 
<H5>  Volodymyr Lanovyy </H5>
  No matter what the real reason behind Lanovyy's joining the 
presidential race, one thing is obvious: In any case, Volodymyr 
Tymofiyovych is winning popularity all over Ukraine, which can 
become a starting block for quite another "jerk." Lanovyy's 
main weakness is his youth, and the main weakness of his 
presidential campaign is that his rivals are still emphasizing 
his "academicism," forgetting about his experience in the sphere 
of production. 
  Although the majority of Kiev residents will most likely 
vote 
for Lanovyy, he does not have many chances for victory, nor does 
his rival Babych. 
<H5>  Petro Talanchuk and Valeriy Babych </H5>
  The education minister has the worst chances among all the 
candidates. It is possible that his campaign will end by 
withdrawing his candidacy in favor of someone stronger -- 
Kravchuk or Plyushch. Valeriy Babych, who is still trying to 
continue an independent game, is in a better situation. Babych, 
former Komsomol leader, is currently exploiting the image of 
businessman descending from the people, who "became somebody" 
only thanks to his determination and willpower. Babych's 
propaganda is a mixture of Lanovyy's market proposals and 
Kuchma's "pro-Russian attitude." Yet, Babych is not particularly 
active in the electoral battle, properly believing that he 
cannot count on victory too much. Apparently, after the defeat 
of several "businessmen" in the parliamentary elections, more 
and more businessmen begin to understand that money does not 
resolve everything in politics. 
<H5>  Chances and Prospects </H5>
  The closer to 26 June, the more precise candidates' 
political 
positions. Kravchuk "is urging reforms" and threatening 
political Philistines with "a leftist parliament." Plyushch has 
become a federalist, and he wants to head the government. 
Kuchma is dodging clear answers to questions concerning 
relations with Russia, and he is demonstrating his discontent 
with [Crimean President] Meshkov. Moroz is surprised when he 
hears that "the leftists are against the market," and has 
suspended his membership in the Socialist Party. The general 
harmony has been joined by newspapers supporting their own 
candidates. According to a survey of the press, conducted by 
the "Rivnist Mozhlyvostey" [equality of opportunities] committee 
between 23 and 29 May, newspapers published at the expense of 
Ukrainian taxpayers have already clarified their positions: 
HOLOS UKRAYINY devoted most of its space to candidate Kravchuk, 
UKRAYINA MOLODA -- to candidate Moroz, ROBITNYCHA HAZETA -- to 
candidate Kuchma. 
  Kravchuk, Plyushch, Moroz, and Kuchma have the best chances. 
In a situation when the risk level is the same for all 
candidates, Kravchuk and Kuchma have the greatest chances of 
advancing to the second round, which means that Leonid Kravchuk 
will be reelected. 
  The situation is being complicated by the fact that 
Ukrainian 
legislation does not define the ethical conduct of someone who 
already holds an official post and repeatedly runs in the 
elections. In other words, our society is not insured against 
certain official's -- such as the speaker or president -- using 
the entire arsenal at his disposal to influence, for instance, 
the television or special services against his opponents. It 
cannot be said, however, that this is currently taking place in 
Ukraine, but this still means that one can manipulate our 
society.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who is one of 
the candidates to the presidential post in the current election 
campaign, admits the possibility of two official languages -- 
Russian and Ukrainian, Interfax-Ukraine reports. This idea is 
set forth in Kravchuk's election program, entitled "Through 
Civic Accord to a Stronger State and Faster Reforms." 
  Observers believe that the recognition of Russian as 
Ukraine's second official language will win him additional votes 
in the predominantly Russian eastern and south-eastern regions. 
  If elected, Kravchuk will work for the adoption of a new 
constitution. He favors a presidential-parliamentary form of 
government which, he says, excludes the monopolization of power 
by one of the authoritative branches. 
  Kravchuk supports the concept of unitary state with a 
well-developed network of local governments and broad economic 
independence of the regions. He also favors a legal settlement 
of relations with Crimea. He comes out for the development of 
the CIS, for a more intensive economic integration of the CIS 
countries and for equitable relations with the neighbors, 
including Russia. 
  Kravchuk attaches great importance to a radical improvement 
of the investment climate and will make efforts to ensure that 
Ukrainian and foreign entrepreneurs be equally interested in 
making investments to the Ukrainian industry. 
  He is planning to accelerate the monetary reform and to 
introduce the internally convertible "hryvna." 
  He favors the idea of lowering the bank rates, separating 
the 
finances of industrial enterprises from the state budget, and 
accelerating privatization under state control.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Moroz, Ukrainian Supreme Soviet </F>
speaker, by Grigoriy Spektor; place and date not given: Under 
the "Hello!" rubric: "Speaker Proposes Strong Government for 
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of Ukraine's Supreme 
Soviet, has decided to meet the press in his new capacity. The 
questions to the speaker were put by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
correspondent Aleksandr Spektor. 
  [Moroz] The decision to put myself of all people at the head 
of parliament is the optimal variant. In the difficult time 
Ukraine is going through, the reins of government should be in 
strong hands. In guiding parliament I am not supposed either to 
tug at the reins or to let them go slack. Today all normal 
politicians are Marxists in the best sense of the word who, 
having dialectically mastered the whole mass of knowledge, are 
creatively using it. If one tries to pressure me they'll know 
where to quit. 
  [Spektor] Do you think selling land may mark the beginning 
of Ukraine's pulling out of the crisis? 
  [Moroz] Given the Republic's economic situation, to turn 
land into a commodity, is a crime before the people and the 
future generations. An unemployed person in the West gets 
benefits 50 times that of a Ukrainian professor's salary. 
Granted dual citizenship, that person could buy with his 
benefit payment vast tracts of land. Selling land as a 
condition for getting foreign investments is unacceptable. 
Investors of this sort may pursue different ends. Investments 
for partnership may be secured in a dignified way, through a 
long-term lease for example. But the West's attitude to Ukraine 
is too short-sighted. Including to Ukraine's desire to become a 
non-nuclear power. No, we are not in a position to maintain 
nuclear weapons today. They should not become necessary for us 
in the future. But we cannot get rid of them overnight. 
Compensation to Ukraine for giving up nuclear weapons is in 
fact the West's payment for its own peace and security. But the 
West has decided to profit by someone else's misfortune; it has 
offered Ukraine only humiliating handouts. This, despite the 
fact that the desire of a nuclear power to go over to 
non-nuclear status has no precedent in world history so far. 
  [Spektor] Do you agree with the widely held opinion that a 
number of deputies are engaged in commerce? 
  [Moroz] Yes, this did and will happen. It is the 
possibility to engage in honest commerce that progressive 
politicians have been pressing for. But to benefit the state, 
the people, not just themselves alone. In order that commercial 
activities of deputies stay within the law, the commission on 
combating organized crime should be real, effective, and 
subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. This parliament is 
in for difficult and unpopular measures, with part of Ukraine's 
population, to reinvigorate the ailing economy -- primarily the 
sphere of regulating foreign currency turnover, and control over 
credit policy. There should be an efficient government in order 
to control economic life normally. The present government is no 
longer competent, it is incapable of creative work. Therefore a 
new government should be formed immediately without waiting for 
possible presidential elections: Anarchy is ruinous for Ukraine; 
if the paralysis of power drags on, the process of 
disintegration may become irreversible. [interview ends] 
  For the time being Oleksandr Moroz is among those who are 
running for president. It is probable, however, that closer to 
the election date he will drop out. Most probably in favor of 
Leonid Kuchma.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zabirko] </F>
  [Text] There can be different attitudes toward the 
suspension of political activities by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman 
of the Political Committee of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, 
who has decided to focus on issues of the state at large. It is 
common knowledge that foreign parties' leaders do not act in 
this way. Apparently, this is why a news conference began with 
the reading of a statement issued by the political committee, 
and only then did Sergey Kiyashko -- who is acting as chairman 
until another Socialist Party Congress -- brief attendees on the 
first weeks of the new parliament's work, and in particular, the 
socialist faction's activities, as well as answer questions from 
journalists. He said that Oleksandr Moroz does not intend to 
drop out of the presidential race. In his opinion, the election 
should be held in June. 
  Later, Yuriy Boldyrev, member of the "Yednist" parliamentary 
group which unites entrepreneurs, also appeared at the House of 
Public Organizations' conference room. On property issues, the 
group sympathizes with the right wing, and on cultural ones, as 
Boldyrev said, it is ready to cooperate with the left wing. In 
general, the answers could give the impression that the division 
and search for compromises in the parliament are still 
continuing. Members of the Labor Party, for example, have joined 
various factions. Judging from all signs, fruitful legislative 
work will begin no time soon. 
  The presence of regular party members at the news conference 
was unusual. So was the presence of Donetsk Oblast Council 
Chairman V. Chuprun, who enjoys the socialists' support in the 
election for oblast leader. V. Chuprun reported that a regular 
session of representatives of 10 bordering Russian and Ukrainian 
oblasts will be held in Donetsk on 27 May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevhen Talipov, chairman of the Lvov City </F>
Committee of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, Ivan Lutsuk, 
chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party Oblast Committee, and 
Oleksandr Pokrovskyy, member of the Ukrainian Socialist Party 
Political Council, by Oleh Statsyshyn; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Our meeting with the leadership of the Lvov branch 
of the Ukrainian Socialist Party [SPU] was held in one of the 
downtown bars. Six leaders of the Lvov branch, including SPU 
Oblast Committee Chairman Ivan Lutsuk, SPU City Committee 
Chairman Yevhen Talipov, and Oleksandr Pokrovskyy, member of the 
SPU Political Council, were present. These names are not 
well-known to the general public, however, to a great extent, 
their viewpoints reflect the position of the party. It is 
natural that the interview began with a question as to how the 
SPU views the current political situation in our state. 
  [Talipov] The fact that Chairman of the Political Council O. 
Moroz became Supreme Council chairman is positive. He is not a 
political novice. I do not think that Ukraine will lose while 
he is in office. He has profound experience and a desire to 
work. I believe that he will become a consolidating factor and 
will not be affected by political affinities. 
  [Statsyshyn] Do you believe that Moroz will manage to unite 
the leftist and right forces? 
  [Talipov] If he is unable to do this, we were wrong and 
should not have placed our stakes on him. He has every 
opportunity and all the strength to unite the legislature. The 
key issue is the independence of Ukraine, the welfare of the 
population, and adhering to promises which we gave to our people. 
  [Statsyshyn] Some SPU deputies see their primary mission as 
"restoring what has been ruined by the democratic 
administration." What do you mean by this? 
  [Talipov] Our position is clear and evident. Each Supreme 
Council deputy -- before he was elected a deputy -- provided a 
program which promised welfare and more active battles for the 
independence of Ukraine, democracy, and social progress. The 
previous legislature did not fulfill any of their promises -- 
virtually nothing was implemented, only streets were renamed, 
symbols changed, "wild" capitalism was imposed on us and, in 
addition, they resigned early. Therefore, people said "no" to 
them. Currently, new people -- able to rebuild Ukraine -- will 
come to power. However, reconstruction does not mean the 
destruction of everything which existed before. The previous 
legislature adopted some 300 legislative acts. Should we repeal 
them? The key task is to continue reviving Ukraine. 
  [Statsyshyn] What priorities were discusses at the SPU 
plenum? 
  [Pokrovskyy] I participated in the work of the plenum. The 
democratic administration ruined some things and we should 
restore them. They completely ruined the economy over the past 
four years. Dozens of enterprises do not work, employment and 
prices have grown considerably. Therefore, I believe, that the 
key task is to restore the economy. The principle aim is to 
stabilize prices, restore a stable national currency, liquidate 
profiteering, and restore the volume of production. We 
discussed this at the plenum. The point is that it is necessary 
to stabilize the political system in Ukraine, to unite the 
efforts of all political parties, trade union movements, and 
working collectives to resolve economic issues. To consolidate 
society, the Political Council adopted a decision to suspend the 
activities of O. Moroz as chairman of the SPU. His obligations 
were transferred to People's Deputy Serhiy Kyyashka. 
  [Statsyshyn] Are the fears of Ukraine losing its 
independence 
under socialist rule founded? 
  [Talipov] The one who says these words has not read any of 
the SPU documents. You will not find anything you are speaking 
about in our program. The West does not welcome us, we wish to 
restore the relations which have been ruined. Those people -- 
the ones who did this -- are now wealthy. However, working 
collectives and working people suffer. Therefore, we will never 
tell people such nonsense. Why was Oleksandr Oleksandrovych 
supported in the legislature? Because he did everything to 
revive Ukraine. In the true sense of the word. 
  [Statsyshyn] You said that Moroz's task was to unite all of 
the political forces. How will you explain that neither 
Kostenka nor Durdynets -- who were proposed by other legislative 
factions -- were elected deputy chairmen? How will Moroz find 
common language with, let us say, Chornovol or Khmara? Do you 
think that they want to unite with you? 
  [Lutsuk] What is the basis for consolidating political 
forces? The concept of independence. This is one of the 
postulates of the SPU program. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose 
independence? Ukraine has huge economic potential. Therefore, 
we support a wealthy Ukraine. Do Chornovol or Khmara oppose 
this? Therefore, I believe that we will be able to find common 
language with both Chornovol and Khmara. 
  [Talipov] By the way, according to Ivan Makar, O. Moroz is 
the smartest Supreme Council deputy. The Supreme Council 
chairman is a person around whom all parties and movements 
should unite. He should not adopt someone's platform, such as 
our esteemed President Kravchuk did. Either he consolidates 
with Rukh or he goes to the people, or he goes somewhere else; 
in a word, he has no established position. The Ukraine of today 
is neither communist, nor socialist, nor belonging to Rukh, nor 
to anyone else. We have a multiparty system and the people will 
decide for themselves who they will follow. The fact that the 
bloc of leftist forces won in the election demonstrates that the 
people's eyes have been opened and esteemed deputies should 
respect their opinion. There are still such people who believe 
that the "Rukh is our navigator."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 10 June TASS -- "The halt of the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant will not change the general situation, 
bearing in mind the operation of Chernobyl-type reactors at 
other power plants of the Dnieper River basin near the Ukrainian 
borders. Nobody is going to halt them," says a report of the 
Ukrainian Government circulated here today in response to the 
campaign of the Greenpeace international non-governmental 
ecological organization which demands an immediate halt of the 
Chernobyl plant. 
  In the opinion of the Ukrainian Government, this problem 
should have a comprehensive solution. Nuclear reactors have 
been given preference in development of power engineering over 
the past decades. Ukraine has practically not modernized 
thermal power plants and power plants of other types. The 
majority of them now have worked-out technical resources and 
equipment which require immediate modernization and the 
introduction of modern ecological technologies of burning. 
Thus, the Ukrainian thermal power engineering will not 
compensate the halt of the nuclear power plant which counts for 
almost 10 per cent of electricity production capacities. 
  The government is doing much to raise the plant's safety. 
There are no deviations in its work. Two units are working in 
the permitted capacity regime. The state of the "shelter" 
facility over the damaged unit, as well as of the whole plant is 
under permanent control of the State Committee for Supervision 
over Nuclear Safety. 
  "The complete halt of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant will 
turn it into the largest energy consumer from a major energy 
producer. Some 300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity will be 
needed to keep the technical state of the plant every year, not 
to mention huge state allocations," says the document. One 
should also not forget about social problems. 
  One can understand the demands to immediately halt the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant. "However, this problem can have 
a constructive solution only through the modernization of the 
whole energy complex, which Ukraine will not be able to do 
without international assistance. 
  "The intention of the G7 to discuss assistance to the 
Ukrainian power engineering, including the safety of its nuclear 
power engineering and the future of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant, is a great hope. 
  "There are no doubts that all problems related to the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant will be further solved with due 
account of the requirements of population safety and 
environmental protection," says the report.

  [Text] Kiev 10 June TASS -- An inconsiderable increase of 
technological leakage of contaminated water from the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant's basin of worked-out fuel assemblies has 
been registered today, head of the Ukrainian State Committee for 
Nuclear Power Engineering's Emergency-Dispatcher Department 
Sergey Nazarenko told ITAR-TASS. 
  In his words, the system of technological water collection 
excludes their leakage in the environment and provides for 
reliable collection of the contaminated water and its processing. 
  The radiation situation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
is now normal, he said.

reliably collected for special treatment. 
  The situation at Chernobyl is said to have returned to 
normal.

  [Text] On 11 June a water leak was discovered at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine. The water was 
leaking from the holding reservoir of the power generating unit 
No. 2. The reservoir is used to store cassettes with worked-out 
fuel. A shift leader at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, 
Aleksandr Yelchishchev, said the leak had not led to changes in 
background radiation levels in the nearby premises. Let me 
remind you that in accordance with the existing schedule, power 
generating unit No. 2 is currently undergoing decommissioning.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned that in 
the second unit of Chernobyl nuclear power station, 
approximately two tonnes of water, with a radioactivity of 
approximately 1.0 microcuries per liter, has been leaking out 
from the initial location of the containment of nuclear 
assemblies [yaderna kaseta], which have been spent in the 
reactor (the cooling pond), each hour since 7 June because of 
damage, which has not been found yet. 
  Hennadiy Masakov, head of the inspectorate of the state 
committee for nuclear and radiation safety at Chernobyl nuclear 
power station, told a UNIAN correspondent that 480 nuclear 
assemblies from the reactor, which was stopped in October 1991 
following the fire in the turbine room, had been placed in the 
cooling pond. The collection of the leaked water has been 
organized at the unit. In addition to the basic scheme of the 
water supply in the cooling pond, another three reserve ones 
have been prepared. 
  The nuclear assemblies are not threatened with being without 
water. 
  According to an elaborated program, the search for the 
location of the water leak is being carried out. 
  It has been reported at Ukraine's state committee for the 
use 
of nuclear power that such incidents have occurred before, but 
on 7 June it became more noticeable. The level of radioactivity 
has not changed and remains lower than normative restrictions. 
  The document on this event, which Viktor Vasylchenko, chief 
engineer at Chernobyl nuclear power station, signed, contains 
this conclusion: "There is no uncontrolled emergence of 
radioactive substances in accordance with restrictions 
established by conditions of normal operation, no increase in 
the dose of the irradiation of personnel, nor additional 
contamination of the environment due to the leakage of water 
from the cooling pond."

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" program] </F>
  [Text] Today we have a link-up with Minsk and Kiev. The 
leaders of the two republics have agreed to comment in the 
"Novosti- Plyus" program on the statement made by chairman of 
the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko, who suggested that in 
all probability a confederation state will appear on the 
one-sixth of the dry land [former Soviet Union], which in future 
can easily change into a federation. 
  [Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Belarus] This is at present a rather difficult 
question. In principle, I do not reject a confederative 
structure in any state or group of states. But at present a 
somewhat different principle triumphs in the world. At present, 
it is difficult to find a federative state or group of states 
that would merge on purely federative terms, or confederative 
terms. There are elements of one and the other, and even 
something new is emerging, like in the proposals put forward by 
Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev. These contain a new 
proposal on the establishment of a new union. All this deserves 
attention, discussion, and careful examination. But in my view 
the first thing we should do is achieve economic union. This, I 
think, is the most important thing. 
  And meanwhile it is a holiday in Russia. We rejoice in this 
holiday and we send our heart-felt greetings. I convey 
greetings on my own behalf, on behalf of the presidium of the 
Supreme Soviet, and the people of Belarus to the people of 
Russia, the Russian Government, and the President of the Russian 
Federation, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, on the occasion of this 
holiday, and wish them all the best on their road of 
independence. 
  [Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk] First of all I would 
like 
to convey greetings to the peoples of the Russian Federation on 
their national holiday. I would like to take this opportunity 
to wish success, happiness, well-being, and prosperity to all 
the peoples of the multi-ethnic Russia, to our closest neighbor 
and, shall I say, kinsman. 
  Another important aspect for all of us is that the 
proclamation of Russia's independence became a starting point 
for the proclamation of independence of other states. I recall 
that as soon as the Russian parliament adopted the declaration 
of independence, Ukraine, and later other states of the former 
Soviet Union, adopted their own declarations of independence. 
Therefore both in time and in geographical terms, and in any 
other imaginable way, this Russian independence holiday is 
related to the independence of other peoples and states. 
  For me, independence is the right to resolve independently 
those issues that every people, every state has to resolve for 
itself. 
  At present we and Russia are at a very crucial stage. I 
would describe it as a singularly important stage. We have 
begun drawing up a treaty of friendship, cooperation and 
partnership. A basis for this treaty is already in existence. 
We ought to resolve those issues that can, shall I say, 
complicate the signing and adoption of this most important 
document between the two peoples and state. One such is the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet. We are making very difficult 
step, but they are still steps forward. That's what I would 
like to say.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] June 11 TASS -- On the eve of 
Russia's Independence Day Petr Luchinskiy, chairman of the 
Moldovan parliament, gave an interview to TASS. He 
congratulated Russian citizens on the occasion and said that 
"Russia has been, is and will alway be a great power. It has an 
enormous potential. It will overcome difficulties, and its 
revival is sure to come." He pointed out further that the 
Russian and Moldovan nations have a long record of friendship 
and cooperation, and he is sure that those relations will be 
continued. It is not accidental that the first legal act, 
adopted by the Moldovan parliament after the proclamation of 
independence, was the treaty on bilateral relations with Russia. 
  Speaking about the conflict in the Dniester region, 
Luchinskiy said that the problem emerged, when the USSR was 
still in existence. Russia and Moldova inherited it together 
with a Russian army, deployed on the left bank of the Dniester 
River. The political make-up is rather complicated in Russia 
today. "We have mutual understanding with the Russian 
leadership. However, there are political forces in Russia which 
support separatism in Moldova," he said. The chairman of the 
Moldovan parliament pointed out that people in the Dniester 
region were tired of hostility. They do not want to be hostages 
of adventurers. "The region has been turned of late into one of 
the strongholds of international terrorism. By the way, I am 
quoting the words of Russian General Aleksandr Lebed, the 
commander of the army deployed there. He is urging the local 
population not to trust the Tiraspol leadership, which is 
steeped in stealing and corruption," Luchinskiy said. A 
favourable moment has come for settling the problem of the 
Dniester region. Tremendous changes took place in Moldova, 
especially after the latest elections the the public opinion 
poll. People no longer trust extremists. 
  In the opinion of Luchinskiy, nothing binds people better 
that common interests and a common market. We should bring down 
the politization of our relations, should give a chance to the 
economic agreements, signed within the CIS framework, to start 
working. We need a free movement of goods, capital and 
workforce. Moldova is tied to the Russian market. We should 
cooperate, if this is advantageous for both countries.

  [Text] President Nazarbayev meeting Friday [10 Jun] in Alma 
Ata [Almaty] with the visiting Estonian President Lennart Meri 
said that the creation of a Euro-Asian union (EAU) does not 
envisage the restoration of the former Soviet Union. He said 
there are such fears since some politicians support the idea in 
their statements. This would be a great tragedy and would bring 
about great troubles and more bloodshed. 
  Nazarbayev said that the EAU provides for civilized 
relations 
with the non-members. The Union is open for membership of not 
solely members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
president said that China showed a keen interests to the idea. 
  For his part, Lennart Meri said that Estonia was interested 
in the fact that prevailing on the Euro-Asian mainland would be 
the principles of the democratic development and any threats to 
regional clashes be removed. Proceeding from these positions, 
the Estonian leader said that he warmly welcomes the idea by 
President Nazarbayev about the creation of a Euro-Asian Union. 
  According to Meri, Estonia would not like to fence itself 
from Russia and was prepared to develop the relations. He noted 
there are also problems in relationships with the Russian 
Federation, to which the president attributed the presence of 
2500 servicemen of the former Soviet Army on the Estonian 
territory. Meri hopes, however, that the problem would be 
solved. He said that 31 August when the former Soviet troops 
leave Estonia, Germany and other countries, would an [as 
received] important European event.

Niyazov has by special edict imposed fines equivalent to three 
monthly salaries on the minister of internal affairs, the 
general prosecutor, the chairman of the National Security 
Committee, and the chief of the Republic's Border Guard Troops 
Directorate, as well as on the leaders of two rayons. All of 
them failed to take measures to prevent the fires in the 
Ashkhabadskiy and Gyaurskiy rayons, which have done considerable 
damage to the environment. The blaze started on 5 June and 
mainly engulfed the border zone. A separate decree has 
dismissed Nurmukhamed Ashirov, minister for the use and 
protection of the natural environment, and his deputy for the 
same reason. 
  The money will be transmitted to a special account to be 
opened by the Republic president's staff with the AKB 
"Turkmenistan" bank. In the future all fines for ecological 
crimes in the Republic will come to this account.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev believes that 
settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict cannot be 
carried out without introduction of the separating forces to the 
conflict zone. However, the Azerbaijani leader stressed in an 
interview with Interfax that this military contingent must have 
the CSCE mandate. Aliyev admitted that Russian troops could 
participate in the peacekeeping action, however, they must also 
bear the CSCE sign. 
  Aliyev underlined that his position on the conflict remained 
the same, seeking a peaceful political solution to the issue. 
"The war must be halted since it has no perspectives both for 
Azerbaijan and Armenia," Aliyev pointed out. He was certain 
that settlement must be carried out on a fair basis, this is to 
say on the basis of Azerbaijan's sovereignty, territorial 
integrity, inviolability of the borders and taking into 
consideration the generally recognized international standards. 
  Aliyev emphasized poor efficiency of the two-year efforts 
put 
by the Minsk group on settlement in Karabakh. However, he said 
he was interested that the talks be held right within the scope 
of the Minsk group (which includes Russia with its independent 
peacekeeping initiatives). 
  Aliyev recognized Russia's special role. He suggested that 
Russia was interested in the Caucasian region more than any 
other state. The consultations which the Azerbaijani leadership 
has conducted with Russia and the Minsk group prove the value of 
parallel mediation by the CSCE, Russia and the CIS in settlement 
of the conflict, Aliyev underlined. 
  Speaking on possible direct talks with the leaders of the 
self- proclaimed Nagorno Karabakh Republic, Aliyev said, "In 
what concerns this, I have many plans in my head. Something may 
be carried out along." 
  Commenting on possible participation of the Azerbaijani 
military contingent in the peacekeeping action in Abkhazia, 
Aliyev stressed, "In principle, I stand against introduction of 
troops of one country to the territory of another one. However, 
taking into account the persistent requests made by Eduard 
Shevardnadze and the Abkhazian party, we gave our consent. We 
regard the issue with understanding. However, as far as I know, 
only Russian troops will act there."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Albert Kochetkov and </F>
Mikhail Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Tbilisi, 10 Jun -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev says that the peace-keeping mission of the Russian 
forces in Abkhazia can start immediately, if the conflicting 
sides agree to this. This will become possible if he receives 
an agreement from the Tbilisi and Gudauta leaders, with whom he 
will hold consultations throughout today. 
  In the first part of the day Grachev discussed this 
possibility with Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian 
state, in Tbilisi, and in the afternoon he will hold similar 
talks with Vladislav Ardzinba, the Abkhazian leader, in Gudauta. 
  Incidentally, the minister added that the airborne regiment 
of the Russian Armed Forces, which is stationed in Gudauta and 
which has been officially included in the composition of the CIS 
peace- keeping forces, can be brought in for the beginning of 
the peace- keeping mission. This decision will be in keeping 
with the latest well-known edict by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on rendering assistance in settling the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, and at the same time it does not 
run contrary to the decision of the Federation Council, which 
for the time being is holding back from carrying out a 
peace-keeping mission in the conflict zone.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sergey Omelchenko from </F>
Georgia, including recorded remarks by Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Announcer Nelli Petkova] It is not ruled out that 
the operation to introduce peacekeeping forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone could begin in the near future. 
ITAR-TASS reports that Eduard Shevardnadze has agreed to 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's proposal to immediately 
implement the peacekeeping action of the Russian Armed Forces in 
Abkhazia. 
  [Omelchenko] At the meetings with Eduard Shevardnadze, head 
of the Georgian state, and the republic's Defense Minister 
Vardiko Nadibaidze, it was decided to determine the status of 
Russian bases in Georgia prior to 1 August and to agree the 
peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops on the line of 
disengagement between the Georgian and Abkhaz troop units along 
the Inguri River. 
  There will be three Russian military bases on Georgian 
territory: in Vaziani not far from Tbilisi, in Akhalkalaki in 
the southwest of the republic, and in Batumi. 
  [Grachev] The main question will now be examined--namely

excepting persons who, since 21 August 1991, have obtained 
citizenship of another country -- that is, those who have 
obtained another country's citizenship since 21 August 1991

<F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Vladimir Lukin Proposes His Own </F>
`Sequence of Moves' in Approach to Pyongyang"] 
  [Text] The political crisis on the Korean Peninsula, which 
could assume a military-strategic and even a nuclear dimension, 
is capable of affecting Russia's national interests to a 
considerably greater degree than the conflict in Yugoslavia. 
This is the opinion of Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma 
Committee on International Affairs, which he expounded at a 
briefing for journalists. 
  It is not hard to predict that, in the event of the DPRK's 
joining the nuclear club, South Korea will acquire its own 
"deterrent force." The United States, which is interested in 
preserving the military balance, may see to this. As a result, 
there will be the increased likelihood of a nuclear altercation 
in direct proximity to Russia's borders -- which would make the 
Chernobyl tragedy pale in comparison. 
  One consequence could be the "nuclearization" of the whole 
region, when even Japan, which experienced the horror of "a 
blast brighter than 1,000 suns," will overcome its allergy to 
the military atom. 
  Even if these apocalyptic forecasts do not materialize, the 
standoff on the Korean Peninsula, wherein the Cold War is 
threatening to escalate into a "hot" one, directly affects the 
interests of Russia's national security, and so an "ideological 
approach" to this developing crisis is totally unacceptable, 
Vladimir Lukin declared. It is not a question of "whether or 
not we like Kim Il-song." 
  In the opinion of the committee chairman, nobody can now 
confidently state whether the DPRK leaders are really seeking to 
get their hands on a tool of nuclear blackmail and deterrence or 
whether this is a clever bluff on their part. 
  If we take the second option on trust, Pyongyang's motives 
could boil down to securing international guarantees of 
noninterference in its internal political affairs -- in exchange 
for access to its nuclear installations. In this case we should 
pick the "lesser evil," i.e. provide Russian guarantees and 
persuade our partners to take an analogous step, Lukin believes. 
  "I criticize the U.S. policy only for the sequence of 
moves," 
Lukin emphasized. 
  After pointing out that, in their approach to Pyongyang, 
Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the United States are united in 
maintaining and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime, the former Russian ambassador to Washington proposed 
resorting to tough pressure methods only after the guarantees 
offered to the DPRK have elucidated its true aspirations. 
  At the same time he described as a mistake Moscow's 
statement 
about a kind of "freezing" of the friendship treaty with North 
Korea, which expires in two years' time. This deprives Russian 
diplomacy of almost its last "lever of influence" over its very 
close ally of yesterday.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- "Any further aggravation of 
the crisis around the North Korean nuclear programmes may lead 
to the nuclearisation of the entire region" with nuclear weapons 
appearing next in South Korea and Japan, which might eventually 
lead to another "Chernobyl" in the Far east," Chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Parliament's lower 
house Vladimir Lukin said at a press conference here today. 
  "I am in favour of the civilised approach to the situation 
which has taken shape around the possible creation of nuclear 
weapons in North Korea," Lukin said. 
  He explained that the approach in question stemmed from 
"Russia's determination not to allow the appearance of nuclear 
weapons close to its border. "It is not a question of our 
attitude toward aspects of North Korea's domestic policy, but of 
our vital interests which call for the non-proliferation of 
nuclear arms," he said. 
  As concerns the North Korean angle, Lukin said that the 
North 
Korean regime was probably seeing "its hind [as received] to the 
world community that it is able to create nuclear weapons inside 
the country as the only lever to make others take it into 
account". North Korea is averse to any intervention in its 
internal affairs, lukin stressed. 
  In this context Lukin thinks it wise for all countries 
concerned, i.e. Russia, the United States, South Korea, Japan 
and China, to begin negotiations with North Korea on the 
provision of guarantees of non-intervention in its domestic 
affairs. These negotiations should aim to obtain North Korea's 
agreement to inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  All the countries concerned should resort to "collective 
resolute sanctions" against North Korea only if they find out 
that North Korea is using the negotiations in order to win time 
for the development of the nuclear arms. 
  Lukin stressed that he regards as a mistake the statement by 
the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Russia is ready to 
fully or partially annul the treaty of friendship and 
cooperation with North Korea two years before the expiration of 
its term.

  [Text] The Russian side assesses the round of talks on the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet held in Kiev on Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday as "undoubtedly positive", the chief Russian 
negotiator, Yuriy Dubinin, told Interfax on Friday. 
  According to him, the agreements and understandings reached 
at the Russian-Ukrainian summit held on April 15 and at the 
subsequent talks between the two countries' premiers on April 
23-25 were developed in the course of the Kiev round. "Our task 
was to ensure practical implementation for the draft agreement 
on the first phase of the efforts to resolve the Black Sea Fleet 
problem. We succeeded in opening many brackets in this area. 
The present round ensured a step forward on the road toward 
resolving these problems," Dubinin noted. 
  The talks will be continued on Russian soil, he said. "The 
Ukrainian delegation has been invited accordingly. A concrete 
date for the next round will be fixed in the near future through 
diplomatic channels," Interfax's interviewee pointed out. 
  Pleading an agreement reached with the Ukrainian side, 
Dubinin refrained from revealing the essence of issues agreed 
upon in Kiev.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov INTERFAX-based report in the "Legislation" </F>
column: "Yet Another Profession Will Appear in Russia. 
Lobbyists Will Be Registered by the Ministry of Justice"] 
  [Text] It is quite likely that this fall domestic 
legislation will be supplemented by an enactment regulating 
lobbying activity in Russia. At least, on the decision of the 
State Duma Council, the bill "On Regulating Lobbying Activity of 
Federal Bodies of State Power" has been sent to parliament 
committees for finalization. 
  Under the draft, lobbying is understood as activity by 
"corporate entities or individuals with respect to federal 
bodies of state power aimed at influencing the latter in 
exercising their powers as stipulated by the Constitution and 
laws of the Russian Federation." It defines, among others, the 
following forms and methods of lobbying: presentation of draft 
laws, edicts, orders, and other enactments to federal bodies of 
state power drafted by a lobbying person or group of persons, as 
well as expert assessment of these documents. 
  The bill specifies that "parliament deputies, elected 
officials of the Russian Federation or its components, as well 
as bodies and officials from the executive or judicial branches 
may not act" as lobbyists. True, parliamentarians, ministers, 
judges, and others of that ilk may try themselves in the 
lobbying domain but not until at least a year after they have 
left their posts. 
  Each person acting as a lobbyist must register with the 
Russian Federation Justice Ministry. The lobbyist is obligated 
to send an official report in writing about his activity to the 
same body no later than 20 days after the end of each calendar 
half-year. Income received by the lobbyist is taxed according 
to the laws currently in force.

<F P=106> [News conference by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the </F>
Kremlin marking Russia's 12 June Independence Day; Yeltsin's 
opening remarks followed by question and answer session with 
foreign and domestic correspondents, moderated by Presidential 
Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov -- live] 
  [Text] [Yeltsin] Esteemed journalists, ladies and 
gentlemen. We are starting to acquire good traditions. One of 
them falls on the eve of Independence Day, which has now become 
a state holiday. Since the state holiday falls on a Sunday (12 
June), the government decreed today to announce 13 June a 
holiday. This is the first bit of good news for you. 
  First of all, I would like to congratulate you on this 
holiday and to wish you success in your work and good health 
because I have come to a conclusion that healthy journalists are 
much more objective. Now over to business matters. One can say 
that yet another political year is coming to an end. That is 
why today we have the opportunity to sum up some of the results 
and to talk about the future. What, in my opinion, are the most 
important points? We have had a complex year. I won't dwell in 
detail on the events we have gone through. All of us have 
witnessed them. It is more important to define the influence 
those events had on the life of the country and the experiences, 
both bitter and useful, they brought about. 
  I do not really bear grudges against last year. One might 
say that it was a breakthrough politically. The Constitution, 
the dismantling of the system of soviets, the election of the 
Federal Assembly, and the creation of the system of 
representatives bodies in the regions have become real steps, or 
rather strategic steps that have already been made. I would not 
exaggerate if I say that a new political reality has taken shape 
in the country. The principle of all power to the Soviets has 
ceased to exist. The country is now living according to the 
principle of the division of powers. 
  We have succeeded in stopping the growing confrontation 
between the state bodies, which means stopping the growing 
confrontation in society. We have more cooperation and 
interaction. A dialogue between legislative and executive 
powers is already in place and is now making progress. There is 
a good relationship between the chairmen of the Federation 
Council and the State Duma. I am holding meetings with 
factions' leaders. I hope that these contacts will develop in 
the future. The mood of civic accord, which is gaining momentum 
in Russia, has been reflected in the Treaty of Public Accord. 
  This is not a conspiracy of those in power, as the hard-line 
opposition is claiming. This is a new social climate that is 
being established in our country. More than 800 parties, public 
movements, organizations, and unions have already acceded to the 
treaty. Leaders of all regions have signed up. Furthermore, 
quite a few of those who did not support the treaty in public 
but took an active part in its drafting have also signed. I am 
referring, first and foremost, to some of the groups in the 
State Duma. 
  An important result of the outgoing political year is the 
fact that the positions of extremist forces have been markedly 
weakened. The ranks of the hard-liners are thinning out. The 
opposition is increasingly inclined to civilized ways of 
political struggle. We now have an opportunity to direct our 
main efforts toward constructive work, toward easing the 
economic and day-to-day difficulties faced by ordinary people. 
  Political stability is a most important prerequisite for 
successful economic reform. The situation remains complex here. 
In January-May of this year industrial output fell by 26 
percent compared with the same period last year. At the same 
time, we have managed to keep inflation at a relatively moderate 
level for several months now. Inflation in May was 8 percent, 
compared with 28 percent in January. This is lower than many 
forecasts. 
  Today's tasks are to hold down inflation, to energetically 
advance the reform of production by helping it out of the 
non-payments crisis. If we succeed in doing this -- and I 
believe that we will succeed -- then there is a possibility that 
we will halt the fall in production as early as July, and not 
just in July but from then on. 
  Judging from preliminary assessments, in the summer months 
the level of inflation will most likely not exceed 10 percent 
(per month). There are grounds to think that in July price 
increases will fall to six to seven percent. 
  However, I cannot rule out the possibility that the problem 
of regional unemployment -- in certain regions -- could get 
somewhat worse. An alarming situation is developing in Ivanovo, 
Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kirov, and Pskov Oblasts, and 
also in the Republic of Dagestan. Here the government and local 
authorities must take urgent steps. 
  During the last month the president and government have 
adopted a number of decisions on ending the economic crisis and 
pushing ahead with reform. I have in mind the well-known 
package of six edicts. Today I signed a second package of six, 
making a total of 12 edicts aimed, first and foremost, at 
expanding and intensifying reform. I can list them if you like 
-- you will ask questions anyway. 
  [Kostikov] Interfax correspondent Terekhov asked whether 
there would be any sensations today. So, let us give him a 
little present. 
  [Yeltsin] The first edicts were signed 23 May. They concern 
reform of state enterprises, certain aspects of taxation policy, 
additional measures to normalize settlements and improve 
payments discipline in the national economy, implementation of a 
range of measures to ensure prompt and full payment of taxes and 
other mandatory payments into the budget, abolition of quotas 
and licences for export goods and services, Russia's federal 
highways fund, and the sale of state enterprises that are in 
debt. That was the first package. 
  Edicts on the following subjects were signed today. On 
housing credit: Henceforth, every young person starting work 
will immediately receive a housing loan. Then, as in the rest 
of the civilized world, there will be 30 years in which to pay 
it back; on the issue and circulation of housing certificates; 
on measures to complete the construction of incomplete housing 
projects; on improvement of the work of the banking system in 
Russia -- this is one of the most complex edicts. Its 
implementation will also be difficult; on consumer protection. 
  So that makes 12 edicts. Three more are being prepared: On 
raising the responsibility of directors of state enterprises; on 
protecting the rights of investors and citizens in the 
securities market; and on customs regulations applying to goods 
for investment projects. There may be a number of others too. 
  There is no need for me to comment on them. Much has been 
said about them already. I will say a few words about the ones 
that you are not familiar with at present, the ones which, as I 
have just said, were signed today. These are major decisions on 
economic questions. Their basic aim is to move the reforms 
forward on a broad front. This is the second package, which 
consists of five edicts, there are 12 of them altogether. 
  First, there are decisions and edicts on the state's housing 
policy. It is impermissible that apartments should be beyond 
the means of the majority of citizens. The housing problem, the 
problem of having a roof over one's head, affects millions of 
Russians. So it is necessary to open up prospects for all of 
these in this very important matter. First of all, a system is 
being created making it possible to purchase housing by 
spreading the payments over a long period. A market is being 
organized in incomplete housing projects: Construction that the 
state cannot complete will be completed by businessmen. I am 
sure that things will then proceed more quickly and more 
efficiently. Everyone will gain -- consumers, businessmen, and 
the state. 
  Second, we intend to provide reliable protection for 
citizens' rights in the securities' market. Americans know from 
childhood how to handle them. For Russians this is a new 
matter, which they do not understand and which many consider 
risky. We will protect citizens from misappropriation and 
fraud. Economic freedom should not be turned into freedom to 
cheat people. This will be put in order. 
  Russian business should understand that the time when it was 
possible to line one's pockets very quickly is passing and will 
not return. The successful ones now will be those who put all 
their energy and dexterity into production. The securities' 
market, just like other markets, should finally become civilized 
and humane. The time for talking about this matter has passed. 
The time has come for specific actions, and this means that 
advertising must be put in order, and that the people's right to 
trustworthy financial information must be ensured. We now have 
too many people promising fantastic dividends in the future or, 
say, promising houses in Paris, often without any grounds for 
this. This is simply deceiving people. One can promise people 
only what actually exists -- the actual dividends paid, say, 
over a year. 
  Third, decisions aimed at improving the banking system. We 
intend to consolidate the unity of Russia's monetary system and 
strengthen the regulatory role of the Central Bank. 
  Fourth, crime has become a scourge for Russia. A lot is 
being said about it, but so far people have not felt any 
improvements. Criminal forces are trying to occupy key positions 
in the economy, they are even eager to go into politics. A 
barrier has to be put in their way. Scattered and desultory 
actions cannot ensure that this barrier is put in place. A 
special state program for the fight against crime has been 
adopted recently. The most important thing now is how it is 
being carried out. I have firmly demanded that professionals at 
the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FCS] should free the country of criminal filth. Viktor 
Yerin and Sergey Stepashin, heads of the Interior Ministry and 
the FCS, are personally responsible for this. 
  Fifth, at present about 20 percent of the Russian population 
have incomes that do not ensure their subsistence, i.e. they are 
below the poverty line. This is real poverty. Another 20 to 30 
percent of residents of Russia are on the verge of poverty. 
Today it is one of the most pressing problems in the country. 
The difficulty lies in the fact that it cannot be solved 
through some kind of emergency or one-off measures. Only 
political deceivers or adventurers can promise that next week we 
will have an earthly paradise. A national program to tackle 
poverty under the control of the president is needed. Its' aim 
is to take stock of the resources the country has, and to make 
effective use of them in order to help millions of people, to 
ensure real social protection for them. This program will be 
prepared together with the government, and its' implementation 
will be effected, as I said, under the president's supervision, 
confirmed by a presidential edict. 
  I have dwelt briefly upon several directions in our work, 
proceeding from the premise that the most important thing at a 
news conference is a dialogue with you. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to send my sincere 
greetings to all the people of Russia on the forthcoming 
Independence Day. For us, it is the day of the revival of the 
Russian state, and another opportunity to think about Russia, 
about our motherland, about its' past, its' present and its' 
future, about what we have to do to strengthen it, to make life 
in Russia more prosperous and happy. 
  Now esteemed journalists, I am ready to answer your 
questions. 
  [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you have not mentioned 
another 
important achievement of the past year, the emergence of 
independent television. This too is a vital aspect of 
democracy. So, the first question is from independent 
television, from Aleksandr Shashkov. Microphone, please. 
  [Shashkov] Boris Nikolayevich, those decision you have just 
been telling us about are, in all probability, based on the 
experience of the past years. It is three years now since you 
became the first president of Russia. Tell us please, what is 
the main lesson you as a politician have learned from these 
extremely tempestuous years of your presidency? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] This is a complex question, for there have been 
too 
many lessons, both positive and negative. But if I try to sum 
it all up, the main lesson the president should always remember, 
day and night, is his responsibility for his country. The 
existence of this responsibility, real responsibility, will 
bring about appropriate decisions and, of course, there will not 
be as many mistakes as we had before. I think that this 
responsibility should accompany every step of the president, 
whatever he does. 
  [Kostikov] RIA-Novosti, please. 
  [Unidentified RIA-Novosti correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich, 
do you think the Civic Accord Treaty has achieved its goal? 
  [Yeltsin] Well, one probably cannot say that it has now 
achieved its goal, because it is, as it were, not yet complete 
-- to borrow a term used in the construction industry, because I 
have just come back from a construction industry 
conference. 
  Nevertheless, 853 signed it, is that not so? 
There were 853 signatures to the treaty. This is a powerful 
force. And moreover, not just a Moscow-based force, but a 
regional force. It has already brought many levels together 
that have not closed ranks before or were not able to close 
ranks before or which were in confrontation. There are now 
accords and contact between them, compromise decisions are being 
drawn up, and so on and so forth. So, I think the treaty did 
give society an initial start. Society has become calmer. My 
recent trip to Tatarstan convinced me that the political 
situation in Tatarstan is good. People are in a calm and good 
mood. This is very important. The conciliation commission of 
this treaty has been approved by decree and will permanently 
monitor the implementation this treaty. It must be constantly 
encouraged, new life constantly needs to be breathed into it, so 
that it remains alive and topical, not obsolete. This needs to 
be done. I think we will be able to do it. But I am, of 
course, firmly convinced this step is an absolutely correct one. 
  [Kostikov] Nadzharov, please, Voice [presumably Voice of 
America] 
  [Nadzharov] Boris Nikolayevich, could you repeat today the 
point you have made that communism has been finally vanquished 
in Russia? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] I believe that in our country -- that is, I repeat 
what I have said before -- communism will not come into being in 
our country. [Laughter] Of course, a communist faction and party 
will remain in our country, within a civilized framework, 
including in our parliament. There are several dozen of them in 
our country at the moment. We have always encouraged a 
multi-party system, and it should exist. There should be an 
opposition. It gives a more lively stimulus to the whole of 
life and to the whole of society, including to the leadership 
and to the president, although this is, perhaps, sometimes an 
unpleasant one. Therefore, there will continue to be 
communists, but their decisive significance is small and it will 
not increase. Their social base is now very, very small. 
  [Kostikov] INTERFAX, Telekhov. 
  [Telekhov] Boris Nikolayevich, you said when privatization 
began that you dreamed of there being millions of owners in 
Russia. Tell us, do you think now that the privatization 
campaign is finishing that there are millions of owners and that 
they are deciding the fate of Russia in some way? And this 
particular question: Where have you -- if it is not a personal 
secret -- invested your own privatization voucher? 
  [Yeltsin] I have indeed used my voucher, but unlike TV's 
Lenya Golubkov, I don't want to advertise this, so that everyone 
does not rush the same way. But millions of owners have 
emerged, there is no doubt about it, there are millions of them. 
And just look, when you are travelling by plane, you can see 
how many houses are being built in Moscow oblast, and everywhere 
else for that matter. 
  The first stage of privatization is coming to an end. 
Floatation of major enterprises is also nearing completion. 
Really major ones. Right now we are going through this process 
at ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Works in Moscow]. We'll go through 
it all right; it will only take a few days, and everything will 
be all right there. And after that we will have floated all the 
major enterprises. Well, maybe the nickel works in Norilsk will 
need a few more days. After all, there are 500,000 people there. 
  [Kostikov] I can see that the XINHUA agency wants to ask a 
question. 
  [XINHUA correspondent] Esteemed president, it is now one and 
a half years since you visited Beijing. How do you assess the 
present state of Sino-Russian relations, and what do you think 
of their prospects? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] I consider that the documents we have signed are 
now working very actively. Although less than a full year has 
passed since the visit, our trade turnover has increased by 30 
percent. Up until then it had been steadily falling. Each year 
it kept on declining. Then suddenly it has increased by 30 
percent in the course of one year. This year, I reckon it will 
increase by more than 30 percent. Trade is being pursued very 
vigorously. We are in constant touch with the leadership of the 
republic and maintain contacts and ties. We are now discussing 
the dates for the PRC president's visit. 
  [Kostikov] Vasiliy Konarenko of IZVESTIYA. 
  [Konarenko] Mr. President, I would like to ask the following 
question. Roughly three years after the disintegration of the 
USSR, there remain two determining trends. Some regard 
sovereignty as the basis for their states' prosperity. Others 
feel it must be achieved through a revived union. That is 
obvious. What is your view on this, in particular, the idea of 
a Eurasian union? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] I don't wish at this moment to offend [Kazakh 
President] Nazarbayev by making an assessment of his proposal. 
It needs to be studied. Therefore, I cannot of course say that 
this path is beyond question. I support the idea that the 
commonwealth should gradually evolve into some kind of 
confederative society, operating on the same basis as Europe, 
the European Union. 
  [Kostikov] TRUD newspaper, Kishkin. 
  [Kishkin] Boris Nikolayevich, how do you see the prospects 
for establishing social democracy in Russia? In the West it is 
very attractive to the electorate but in our country one can 
understand when an inclination for social democracy is shown by 
the wise Rybkin or by Gorbachev after falling out with the 
communists. Even Rutskoy, who recently stormed the mayor's 
office and Ostankino television center, declared himself a 
social democrat. So in our country will this not become a 
screen for something that is its direct opposite? Also, in 
general, do you share social democratic views? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] In general, I like the idea when, say, communists 
move over to the ideas of social democracy. Many of them have 
already spoken about this, that they find these ideas attractive 
and that they would be prepared to gradually reorient themselves 
toward this social democratic system. Of course, I have seen 
social democracy in various countries, in many countries. It is 
different in each country. It is very varied even though, of 
course, it has its own core, the social democratic core. 
  Unfortunately, you are right and this also grieves me, that 
in our country it has been seized upon by left-wingers, 
right-wingers and centrists, and all sorts of people, and people 
who simply do not understand politics at all. Therefore, it 
seems to me that a base does exist in our country for the 
development of social democracy. The foundations do exist in our 
country for such a real social democratic movement or party. 
But now it needs to be organized and it needs an organizer. 
  [Kostikov] Tamara Zamyatina of ITAR-TASS. One moment, 
Tamara, they are bringing the microphone. 
  [Zamyatina] Thank you. Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich. Here is 
a question for you, if you will allow me, about Russia's 
international status, about how you assess it at present and 
about the prospects for Russia's entry into the Group of Seven 
and the European Union. If you will allow me I will broaden the 
question a little: Western analysts at present criticize 
Russian leaders and say that we, allegedly, in our efforts to 
enter the European Clubs are using the "proof by contradiction" 
method. We say that if we are not accepted it will be worse for 
you and we will set up a dictatorship. According to them we say 
little about the positive and constructive stimuli that our 
partners will gain by our entry into their organizations. Could 
you comment on this please. 
  [Yeltsin] First, concerning European structures. In order to 
join the Council of Europe one has to go through a long and 
complex procedure. This procedure is being followed. What is 
quite another matter, that even before we join the European 
Council, I mean Union -- and not one of the 12 European states 
objects to Russian membership, since Russia is a European 
country and a great power -- we want to proceed with the first 
stage, that is to sign an economic agreement with the European 
Union so that the rules of the game they follow among 
themselves, internally, would be extended on us too. Naturally 
we should not lose on it, we should profit by it, since we open 
up a stable European market. We did not have this stable market 
before -- in some areas we succeeded in getting through, but not 
in others. Now, on the other hand, we have even reached 
agreement with France concerning uranium, as it were. We have 
also reached agreement on aluminum, and that with the last 
position. [sentence as heard] 
  In other words, the agreement -- I would not go as far as to 
say it is ready -- the wording should be as follows: It is 
virtually ready. So if this word "virtually" is no longer 
there, then on 23 June I will fly to the island of Corfu -- no, 
it is called something else in Greek. What is it? 
  [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you have got a better memory 
than I, I swear. [laughs] Sorry. [laughter from audience] 
  [Yeltsin] Kokru or Kok... 
  [Voices from the audience] Kerkira. 
  [Yeltsin] Kerker, is it? Kerker then. Well, everyone has 
got used to calling it Corfu, right? Leaders of the 12 states 
are to convene there. It is there that accession to the 
European Council [as heard] or the signing of Europe-wide 
agreements of this kind usually takes place. If indeed 
everything is ready, and I very much hope it will be, I will go 
there for one day and sign the agreement. It is to be signed by 
Jacques Delors, by the Greek chairman, who is currently chairing 
the European Council [as heard], and by myself. So that will be 
the beginning of the process of Russia joining the European 
Union, I mean council, I mean European Community. 
  [Yeltsin] Now, concerning G-7 and Naples, we are having 
serious discussions on this. Of course, I also read the foreign 
press and I have noticed that Russia is being reproached for 
suddenly trying to get into G-8, on what basis. Although I 
cannot understand what is meant by what basis. On the basis 
that we are a great country. Are there countries there that are 
bigger than ours, apart from the United States? No. Even our 
economic potential is significant. Well, in brief, of course by 
virtue of our economic level alone we cannot join a G-8 as a 
member with full rights with regard to economic matters. So we 
have decided to divide it up like this. They are to have two 
days of discussions in Naples -- a day of economic discussions 
and a day of political discussions. In the economic one, they 
will consider Russia separately, and that is it. I will not take 
part in the general discussion. In the political discussion, I 
will take part in the general discussion from beginning to end. 
I will also take part in drawing up the general political 
declaration of what will already be G-8. So you cannot say that 
a G-8 has already been formed with Russian involvement. This is 
not so. But with regard to the political section, this is the 
case. 
  [Kostikov] One of our most popular youth newspapers, 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS will soon be an old lady, it is 75 
years-old and is celebrating its anniversary, so I think that we 
probably should not offend Mikhail Burevich so we will let him 
ask a question. 
  [Burevich] Thank you Boris Nikolayevich, this may not 
perhaps 
be a very festive question but what is your attitude toward the 
constant criticism directed toward you, including the 
caricatures and parodies that have been appearing in great 
numbers recently? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, and your newspaper is keeping up with the 
others, of course. What can I say? 
  There is constructive, reasonable, human criticism, which 
does not wound people's dignity or humiliate them. I try to 
learn from such criticism and make use of it in some way, for 
myself, to draw conclusions. If this criticism is unreasonable, 
dirty, or offensive then I pass it by and pay absolutely no 
attention to it. Although I am sometimes encouraged to sue, I 
will not do this, I just do not pay any attention to it. 
  [Kostikov] We had a whole series of questions from Italian 
newspapers on Naples but Boris Nikolayevich has given an answer, 
has anticipated them. I turn to Sadi Amara who is representing 
a group of Arab newspapers, the microphone please. 
  [Amara] Mr. President, many people are saying that the 
Russian leadership is devoting more attention to relations with 
the West than to relations with countries of the so-called Third 
World. How do you see Russia's current relations with the Arab 
world and with the Near East, and more precisely, what is 
Russia's assessment of what is happening in Yemen today, and is 
Moscow prepared to recognize South Yemen as a fully-fledged 
member of the international community? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] I took heed of your criticism at last year's news 
conference when you asked more or less the same question. We 
have broadened our foreign policy to take the East into account 
-- both the Far and Near East, and to take Latin America into 
account. 
  [Yeltsin] We have had contacts with Palestine, and with 
Israel for the first time. I had meetings with Arafat, Mr. 
Arafat, and with Mr. Rabin. We also wish to promote peace there 
of course, and are participating in efforts to achieve this. 
All the signs are that this long-awaited peace may finally 
materialize. 
  We have always had friendly relations with Yemen. These 
tragic occurrences, these tragic events that have taken place 
there -- they are of course a tragedy for the entire people. 
But we support Yemen and consider that it must be a fully 
fledged state within the world community. 
  [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, Nikolay Svanidze, the 
courageous Russian TV journalist who -- it can be said -- has 
taken on Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy single-handed, is here 
with us today. So it would be absolutely improper not to let 
him ask a question. I would merely ask him to confine himself 
to one question. 
  [Svanidze] All right. Boris Nikolayevich, the question is 
not about single combat. My question to you is as follows. As 
we know, anyone who finds himself wielding great authority, who 
is given great authority, changes. The more authority he gets, 
the more he changes. How much have you changed during the years 
of your presidency, and in what way have you changed? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] That is the question I ask my wife every week -- 
because she can discern nuances from the way I walk, the way I 
hold my head when I am walking, and so on, you see. Well, it is 
somehow awkward for me to say that, it might sound immodest, but 
she thinks I have not changed much. I am as driven as I have 
always been. Sometimes I can be strict and tough, as I have 
been. But at the same time I can understand another person, and 
every time I travel I would go to the crowds to meet the people, 
I push myself in and talk to them, be it in Tatarstan, in 
Naberezhnyye Chelny, in Kazan, or in Tverskaya [street in 
Moscow], in a bookshop, marking Pushkin's 195th anniversary. I 
was talking to people the same as I had been doing three years 
ago. 
  My comrades and friends from my team, who usually always 
tell 
me the truth -- it is a tradition that has been formed, there 
are several people who would not flinch from telling the 
president the truth, even if it is an unpleasant one -- they 
have not told me that I have changed in any way. So I can sum 
up by saying that the only change is that I am aging in terms of 
years. 
  [Kostikov] Well, Boris Nikolayevich, even MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS is aging, so what is the point of telling people 
this...[laughs] Mayak radio now, Yuliy Semenov. 
  [Semenov] Boris Nikolayevich, my question is connected with 
the elections in Ukraine and Belarus. There has been all sorts 
of talk about this. Does Russia have any real interest in the 
possible outcome of these elections, and what might it consist 
of? 
  [Yeltsin] Very great interest. Of course, I cannot tell you 
whom we would prefer to see as president. 
  [Kostikov] Don't you remember that man near the bookshop 
with 
whom you had a whispered conversation, Boris Nikolayevich? 
  [Yeltsin] Well, he was a Ukrainian. [laughter] He promised 
he would not tell anyone. The Ukrainian people will deliver 
their verdict on this on 26 June. We will be guided by that. 
  [Kostikov] The newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA. 
  [Yermolin, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Boris Nikolayevich, according to 
official figures from the Ministry of Defense, 75 percent of 
officers' families are currently living off income that is lower 
than the poverty line. Specialists reckon that the budget, 
which has been adopted by the State Duma, the defense budget, 
could push the whole of the Armed Forces beyond the poverty 
line. What steps could be taken to resolve this problem? That 
is a question to you both as president and as supreme commander 
in chief. Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] Of course, the budget that has now been adopted 
does not satisfy the military, but here the government and the 
military themselves must draw conclusions. The military 
themselves must carry out cuts more energetically. The lack of 
decisiveness here is incomprehensible. Today, as a society, we 
cannot maintain a three million-strong army, we just cannot. 
Was it three million for the whole Union or was it three 
million for Russia? Therefore, cutting the Army is one of the 
main questions, one of the main problems the Army itself must 
resolve, with help, of course, from the regional authorities, 
us, and the government. 
  Second, there must be some reduction in expenditure on 
orders 
for military equipment. There are reserves here. Experts have 
already confirmed that such reserves exist and that they can be 
utilized this year. Nevertheless, this will not fill the hole 
that still exists in the budget. So, I held consultations. I 
had long talks with Chernomyrdin before his departure. I had 
talks with Rybkin. I had talks with Shumeyko. Generally 
speaking, we will meet the shortfall from the budget, we will 
find the funds that the Army won't get from that source, by 
drawing on non-budgetary appropriations. This is a realistic 
prospect. The $550 million we are getting from MiG sales to 
Malaysia were not included in the budget. They did not figure 
in this year's budget. That is what we call non-budgetary 
appropriations. What can we do with $550 million? It will be 
handed over and this will completely cover the gap. That is 
what we will do. Especially as it is not just Malaysia. 
Thailand and Australia are also interested in our MiGs -- to 
the very great dissatisfaction of the American side. 
  [Kostikov] Veronika Uscila, KOMMERSANT-DEYLI. 
  [Uscila] Boris Nikolayevich, does the edict on improvement 
of 
the banking system have a section on foreign banks? If not, 
will this edict be signed, and when? What is your personal 
attitude to the possible expansion of foreign banking activity 
in Russia? Thank you. 
  [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you don't have to answer 
every question. The president can leave something in his 
pocket, as it were. [laughs] 
  [Yeltsin] Oh no, if I know the answer I cannot fail to give 
it. If I don't know, then I say I don't. But here I do know. I 
know that this section is contained in an edict I signed today. 
It is there. Yes, the president will be strongly criticized by 
our bankers, because real competition is starting. But it is 
really mind-boggling, this 185 percent bank discount rate that 
we have today. Can this be afforded? Who can afford a loan 
with this rate of interest, be it a private business, any 
enterprise, or a joint stock company? Very few can. But by 
attracting foreign banks to our commercial and financial scene, 
doing it gradually, very thoroughly and certainly not rashly, we 
can revive our entire banking system and lower the rate. Hence, 
better conditions will be in place for enterprises, for 
industry, for businessmen and so on. 
  [Kostikov] I have a question from a representative of the 
Russian Television Agency, called Beglov. I think he is the son 
of our famous Spartak Beglov, whom we all remember so well. 
  [Beglov] I want to return to privatization. Of late there 
has been a lot of fuss about how Yuriy Mikhaylovich and Anatoliy 
Borisovich came to quarrel -- i.e. Luzhkov and Chubays. But 
this is not a private quarrel. [words indistinct] How do you 
view this and do you intend to reconcile them? 
  [Yeltsin] Well, I am of course well aware of this episode. I 
had hoped that they would sort this out for themselves. But it 
did not happen. Government attempts to settle the quarrel and 
reconcile the two did not work either. When Luzhkov addressed 
that big conference of 5,000 people here in the Kremlin Palace, 
he said that Moscow would not carry out privatization a la 
Chubays but would act in accordance with commonsense. Well, 
that is not fair on Chubays. But the Muscovites have already 
gone so far with their own program. This will not affect the 
rest of Russia. The others won't rush to follow suit because 
they are already pursuing the path set out in our programs, the 
programs that have been approved. So, there is no danger of 
this. Today -- in view of the fact that Chernomyrdin is on 
vacation -- I told Soskovets to bring this issue to a close, to 
tell Chubays to leave Moscow alone. 
  [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wishes 
to 
ask a question. This worries me because only yesterday they 
almost sent Chernomyrdin into retirement. I wonder who they 
will sack today! All the same, Zarytov.... 
  [Yeltsin] Just don't go saying that they want to remove the 
president in the fall and send him off somewhere. 
  [Zarytov] Boris Nikolayevich, we won't remove the president! 
  [Yeltsin] I do not intend to go off anywhere until 1996. 
  [Zarytov] OK, that is clear. My understanding is that those 
edicts that you listed are forward-looking and geared to the 
summer and fall. Clearly they will require a frontal assault 
from the government, as you put it -- in other words, great 
efforts. In this connection, could you take stock of the 
government's record during the past year? Are you satisfied 
with its activities? How close to the mark is the speculation 
in our own press and the Western press that a government 
reshuffle is in the offing? It has just been alleged that we at 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA intend to remove Chernomyrdin. Well, Boris 
Nikolayevich, would you be kind enough to give us your view? 
  [Yeltsin] I understand. Of course, it is very difficult for 
any government to operate in such circumstances. Life and work 
are not easy for the president, for you, for anybody living in 
Russia during this period. This also applies to the government. 
First of all, let me tell you what I don't like. I don't like 
a certain tendency, especially among state enterprises, to veer 
back toward planning. Admittedly, it is only a proportion of 
them. Naturally, this cannot be tolerated. Second, I don't 
like corruption in the middle ranks. 
  I have already had discussions with Chernomyrdin on the 
necessity for a serious purging of the apparatus. You know, so 
many people have been taken in, led by Vladimir Kvasov [head of 
the administration of the government of Russia], that it will be 
a long time till we sort everything out. 
  Third, what was signed a week ago and today should have been 
adopted two years ago. It has been said before, but there has 
been one delay after another. So only pressure, really hard 
pressure from the president resulted in those documents having 
been completed in just two days. Everything was agreed with 
lawyers and so on. Everything was completed at 0430 this 
morning. So if pressure is put, if there is no other way, then 
they finally start moving as they should. Which means that, 
generally speaking, they can do their work properly. 
  With regard to Chernomyrdin, I have never had any questions 
about his work in general, although everyone has shortcomings -- 
I have and he has -- that is understandable. Every week we have 
a very long discussion, sometimes one hour, sometimes two, 
sometimes six hours. We discuss many problems and issues in 
detail. So if there are any mistakes, they can be said to be 
joint mistakes, as it were, of the president and the government. 
No, I will not give up Chernomyrdin to anybody, not even to 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. 
  [Kostikov, laughing] Go ahead, but please introduce 
yourself. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] WPROST weekly, from Poland. 
Mr. President, could you please tell us if you have accepted 
President Walesa's invitation to visit Warsaw on 1 August on the 
50th anniversary of the Warsaw uprising. If you have not, why? 
Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] Unfortunately the invitation came too late. My 
schedule of international meetings until the end of the year had 
already been filled in. It is not an easy schedule. Therefore, 
there will certainly be quite a high-level Russian 
representative there, same as in Bratislava. 
  [Kostikov] Colleague on the right, please. No, higher up. 
Yes, I mean you. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Mr. President, 
please forgive me if I address you in English. It is a question 
from the.... 
  [Kostikov, interrupting] We have no interpreter, so I will 
translate, Boris Nikolayevich. But do make it simple. 
  [Correspondent, in English with simultaneous Kostikov 
translation] Mr. President, in a month's time you will be in 
Naples for the G-7 meeting. As you know, there are ministers in 
the new Italian Government who cite the legacy of the fascist 
party. Many European leaders have voiced concern over the 
presence of these politicians in the Italian government. Do you 
share this concern? Do you believe that fascism is a real threat 
in the new Europe? 
  [Yeltsin] No, of course I do not think it is a real threat 
for Europe. As for Italy, as it were, it is after all an 
internal affair for Italians. 
  [Kostikov] Gentlemen, we have to finish presently, a couple 
more questions and that is it, so be prepared. Go ahead. 
  [Yeltsin] The time is up, actually. 
  [Kostikov] Yes, Boris Nikolayevich, but people are 
determined 
to carry on. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Ekho Moskvy radio. Boris 
Nikolayevich, the lower house of the U.S. Congress yesterday 
adopted a decision to lift the embargo on arms supplies to 
Bosnia, following the lead from the Senate. So now both 
chambers have passed this decision. Will there be any reaction 
from you to this decision? Thank you. 
  [Yeltsin] I will soon be meeting Clinton, and we will 
discuss 
this issue again. We regularly keep in touch on all these 
problems. We had a telephone conversation recently, and he 
talked to me about it, but we still have slightly different 
views on ways of resolving this problem. 
  [Kostikov] The last question, you know we already have our 
traditions, we always try to please the ladies, near the third 
microphone please. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] MELBOURNE AGE newspaper, 
Australia. Mr. President, what is your attitude toward NATO's 
latest proposal on the Partnership for Peace program? Will 
Russia sign this document without any further conditions? Thank 
you. 
  [Yeltsin] If you had not added the last phrase, I would have 
said yes, Russia will sign, but with the last phrase...[Yeltsin 
pauses] You cannot call them conditions. We would just like to 
draw up a protocol with NATO on how we should cooperate within 
this complex mechanism, especially with regard to the military. 
It is a complex mechanism. It is a huge army, three million. 
This cannot be approached in a simplified manner. NATO has 
agreed to this, to sign such a protocol. They will sign the 
protocol and we will sign the Partnership for Peace document, we 
will definitely sign it. In the final analysis, even if this 
protocol gets buried in red tape, we will still sign it. 
  [Kostikov] Dear friends and colleagues, let us thank Boris 
Nikolayevich for the news conference, and thank you very much 
for your work. Good-bye, I wish you a pleasant, festive mood. 
  [Yeltsin] Thank you.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 10 June broadcast the nine-minute 
"Details" program which is presented by Nikolay Svanidze, and 
reports on the news conference given by President Yeltsin on 10 
June. It includes brief interviews given to Svanidze by 
Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar, Gennadiy Burbulis, former 
Security Council state secretary, and Deputy Prime Minister 
Anatoliy Chubays. The video is confined to these items. 
  Gaydar is asked why the reform process appeared to slacken 
in 
the summer of 1992 when he was Russian prime minister. He 
replies that a "powerful anti-reform coalition" had emerged at 
that time arguing for money to be pumped into the economy as a 
way out of the crisis. He points out that inflation was at the 
same level in 1994 as it was then and output was down by 30 
percent. He asserts his faith in the need for reform. 
  Burbulis is asked if he has any advice to give Yeltsin 
today, 
and he says he would tell him not to listen to those who were 
saying that "those young democrats, including Burbulis, know 
nothing and are not capable of doing anything and cannot be 
trusted behind your back. I would try my best to warn Boris 
Nikolayich Yeltsin against those well-wishing loudmouths who, in 
my opinion, have already been very successful in their work." 
  Burbulis is then asked if a recent press report by 
correspondent Fedor Burlatskiy alleging that "the decision to 
divide up the USSR was made by a few young politicians, namely 
yourself and Shakhray, in a bath house" is true. He replies 
that he was impressed by Burlatskiy's ability to hide under a 
bath house bench and imitate a tub, and adds that "no one could 
ever have thought up a formula for bringing down the Soviet 
Union. The Soviet Union fell apart." 
  Chubays, interviewed in a corridor, is asked for his 
reaction 
to Yeltsin's statement that he should leave Moscow Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov in charge of privatization in the capital. Chubays 
says: "Everything is okay. The situation is like this: I am 
sure that the transfer of authority over privatization to the 
mayor of Moscow will lead to all those dramatic results that are 
already taking place in Moscow today, and will naturally now be 
intensified. Therefore, I believe that the results will be 
serious, but my position is clear -- I submit to the president." 
  Svanidze then asks Chubays if Yeltsin's statement at the 
news 
conference was a surprise. He replies: "Of course not, of 
course not."

  [Text] A 507-strong constituent convention, held Sunday in 
Moscow on the initiative of the Russia's Choice faction in the 
State Duma, declared the creation of "Russia's Democratic Choice 
Party." 
  Co-chairman of the Ukrainian inter-regional bloc 
Grinev-Kuchma and the former deputy-speaker of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Soviet Vladimir Grinev greeted the convention. On 
behalf of the delegates, Anatoliy Chubays, who chaired the 
convention, wished the inter-regional bloc success in the June 
26 presidential elections. 
  President Yeltsin's press secretary Viacheslav Kostikov 
refuses to recognize the new party as "presidential". But in 
terms of politics, he told newsmen, the new party shared much 
with the president and was a product of what Yeltsin started 
back in 1991. 
  According to Kostikov, the Choice's leaders had made no 
false 
moves to make Yeltsin join them. In response to a question from 
Interfax, Kostikov said the convention could yet receive a 
message of greeting from Yeltsin. 
  In Kostikov's view, the new party and Yeltsin ought to keep 
a 
reasonable distance between them. 
  Kostikov would not want to join the party in his capacity of 
a public servant. That would make it more difficult for Yeltsin 
to work, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Buchinskiy under the rubric "Barometer of the </F>
Week": "The Key to the Gates of the Crimea"] 
  [Text] The noisy "sorting out" between Kiev and Simferopol 
remind one of a phenomenon of the recent past when the stupid 
wife tried as hard as she could to keep her husband not with 
charm but with the help of the party organization. But be that 
as it may, the past seven days have essentially been an 
international "Crimea week." On all continents and in all 
languages of the planet people have written about it, spoken 
about it, and waited for the appearance of another hot spot on 
the map. They waited with such impatience that it would seem 
that the ones that already have existed and still exist are not 
enough for mankind. Probably only vampires wait for blood this 
way. But here is what I wonder: In our malice and mindlessness 
have we really become like these bloodsuckers? But these 
"certain forces" that are interested in bloodshed and always 
remain unseen--who are they? Where are they? In Kiev or Lvov, 
"overseas" or in the sparse growth of trees beyond a nearby 
knoll in the Crimea itself? Who can tell us about this? One 
thing is unquestionable: They exist. Just as the stern young 
Philistine exists, the one who is ready to kill his compatriots 
for dollars. He did this in the Dniester region, Abkhazia, and 
Georgia. He is doing this professionally today in Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. Killing is his work, a bloody craft. He is a 
mercenary. For those same interested "certain forces" who, 
having given him a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and a cartridge 
pouch to go with it, paid generously for murder while they 
themselves remain in the shadows. Who is doing this? Perhaps a 
bold journalist? I wrote about this and I shudder to think 
about our colleagues in journalism who unthinkingly and in the 
service of these same interested "certain forces" select words 
like matches and help them to kindle the fire in their own home, 
on the threshold of the homeland. 
  I recall several weeks ago when our newly elected parliament 
had not yet begun to work and there was no discussion of 
returning to the 1992 Constitution, but in a Moscow newspaper 
that was once popular among the people there already appeared a 
matchstick-report under the heading "War in Crimea--and 
Everything Is Up in Smoke." That is how it is, and nothing less! 
It was all about the president of Ukraine overturning one of the 
first edicts of the president of Crimea. Let us make noise, 
brothers, let us make noise.... The Russian press, writes V. 
Popova, a Moscow journalist, in GOLOS UKRAINY for 31 May 1994, 
from time to time reports "on tanks that have arrived in Crimea, 
field hospitals that are prepared for receiving wounded from the 
`Crimean front,' tens of thousands of international guards who 
are right on the verge of storming the state institutions of 
Simferopol. There is no doubt that somebody is skillfully 
orchestrating and directing this campaign. But who and in the 
name of what?" 
  Enough, colleagues. It is time for honor. It is unbecoming 
for us to be like the extreme right-wing nationalists in Ukraine 
who, in the words of the representative of the Ukrainian 
National Assembly, Oleg Vitovich, are already forming 
"recreation groups" who will actively propagandize Ukrainian 
statehood in the Crimea. (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 26 May 1994) 
This popular newspaper previously in two issues noted, fairly, 
in my view, that President Yu. Meshkov is not likely to want 
war. The head of the government, Ye. Saburov, and his Moscow 
team do not need war either...to what has been said one can add 
without exaggeration: The same thing applies to the newly 
elected parliament and all of us Crimeans! 
  Fortunately, the smell of gunpowder, iodine, and blood comes 
only from the pages of certain newspapers and also television 
programs. But in the Crimea it is a nice summer. Students and 
school children are taking exams. The cherries are ripening in 
the sun and the grain is ripening in the fields. Last Sunday was 
a holiday--Simferopol was 210 years old. There was dancing and 
music, and people went walking in all the parks and on the 
streets of the city, and there were colorful festive fireworks. 
This is the truth. This is reality. And all the talk about war 
in the Crimea or its fatal inevitability is a bluff, an idle 
fabrication. 
  In essence there is no conflict between Kiev and 
Simferopol. It was invented on the banks of the 
Dnieper-Slavutich by the high leaders of the Ukrainian 
independent and autonomous Ukraine. They saw in the aspiration 
of the Crimeans for a little more independence and freedom than 
they have now the right to decide for themselves what to do to 
live better, the beginning of the long ripening schism in the 
unitary state of Ukraine. And this terrifies them. They are as 
afraid of this as they can be. Hence, the "war" of presidential 
laws, the desire to "set them straight," to put Crimean 
President Yu. Meshkov and the new parliament of the Republic of 
Crimea in their places. This could be the only motivation for L. 
Kravchuk's demand for the parliament of Ukraine to grant him 
additional authority to impose order in the Crimea and create a 
Constitutional Court. And now Rukh has also demanded that Leonid 
Makarovich eliminate the parliament and the institution of the 
presidency in the Crimea and introduce direct presidential rule. 
All this occurred last week. Fortunately, the period when Leonid 
Makarovich was dancing to the fiddle and tambourines of the Lvov 
directors has passed and he made no abrupt moves. Now the 
commissions of the Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Crimea are 
seeking a consensus. They will find it if they take advantage of 
the experience of relations between Russia and Tatarstan, where 
President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin visited last 
week. A half year ago they were faced with a situation there, 
which was identical to the current relations between Ukraine and 
Crimea. Thus, there was a bitter war of laws between the 
presidents. It continued until B. Yeltsin understood that it was 
pointless to wage it and proceeded to a compromise--treaty 
relations between Russia and Tatarstan. The treaty became the 
key to political stabilization. Here is what ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
wrote about it in a report on B. Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan in 
the issue for 3 June 1994: "Far-sighted politicians like the 
president of Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, have understood that 
discussions of separatism and national independence helped them 
to come to power but by no means allow them stay at the helm 
since people are not fed on political ambitions and you cannot 
advance the economy with them." The treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan, the newspaper continues, was a consequence of a 
recognized necessity. 
  Publishing a detailed discussion of the favorable changes 
that have occurred literally in a couple of months (the treaty 
was signed in February), the newspaper notes in particular that 
"Tatarstan has changed from a region which almost frightened 
children into one of the most peaceful republics for the life of 
people of various nationalities." 
  The model of the relations between the Center of Russia and 
Tatarstan is now being studied in Moscow as valuable experience 
and is regarded as a possible universal golden key which will 
open the doors to a constructive national and regional policy. 
  Perhaps there is a reason why Kiev is trying to use a 
similar 
key to open the gates of the Crimea and not resort to breaking 
and entering or looking for the key in the old trunks left over 
from Mazepa's times. Think, lads, apply yourselves.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova: "Legislators of the Whole </F>
Country Unite"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council held a conference 10-11 June 
with leaders of organs of representative power in Russian 
Federation components -- republics, krays, oblasts, and 
autonomous formations. Taking part were the leaders of the 
parliament's chambers, Federation Council and State Duma 
deputies, representatives of the government, and heads of 
representative organs of power in Federation components. 
  In connection with the recently widespread story that a 
"power party" of regional leaders is maturing within the depths 
of the Federation Council (a nonformalized but influential 
party, needless to say) the conference can be regarded as a kind 
of organizational event: This is the first time that the top 
leaders of the Federal Assembly have met specially with their 
colleagues from the regional parliaments, legislative 
assemblies, oblast dumas, etc. A parallel involuntarily 
suggests itself with last year's clear attempt by the Supreme 
Soviet to create a legislative vertical to counterbalance the 
executive -- something for which neither the previous nor the 
current Constitution incidentally make provision. 
  However, just as the political situation has changed over 
the 
year, the tasks facing the chambers of the Federal Assembly as 
regards regional representative power have also changed 
considerably. Let us start with the fact that, even if it were 
planned, the formation of a vertical has been complicated by the 
federal parliament's "division in two": Notwithstanding the 
fact that the upper and lower chambers ultimately have common 
objectives (the formation of federal legislation) the Federation 
Council's and State Duma's tactical goals and behavior patterns 
differ considerably and the contradictions between them are too 
marked to presuppose any unity of will as regards "government" 
and even as regards coordinating the activity of all 
representative bodies in the localities. What is more, the 
Federation Council, which developed in the absence of local 
legislative organs in most regions, comprises to a considerable 
extent republic presidents and the heads of kray and oblast 
administrations, i.e. representatives of the executive, whose 
interests differ considerably from those of the representative 
branch (although this fact may be an additional incentive for 
the Federation Council to cooperate with local legislators). Be 
that as it may, Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko 
considers the talk of a "power party" futile and insists that 
the parliament needs to work with Federation components in order 
to further develop the principles of Russia's federal system. 
The task now is no longer and not so much to reallocate powers 
between the center and the regions, he said, as to establish 
normal relations between the actual components of the 
Federation. In this process the upper chamber is in his view 
designed to defend the interests of Federation components -- 
both in their relations with the center and in cooperation among 
them. 
  As for the State Duma's objectives, they were expressed 
fairly clearly during the parliamentary hearings 9 June devoted 
to the principles of coordinating the legislative activity of 
organs of state power. With regional representative organs' 
acquisition of legislative functions (under the new 
Constitution) the question arises of systematizing all lawmaking 
activity, without which legal chaos, or at the very least 
disagreements that may destroy the country's unified legal and 
economic area, are inevitable. State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
has of late repeatedly spoken of Russian legislation lagging 
behind the requirements of economic reform. This considerable 
deficiency, he believes, must be overcome, and as quickly as 
possible. According to the organizers of the State Duma 
parliamentary hearings and the Federation Council conference 
that has just opened, cooperation in this sphere may be good for 
the cause. 
  At any rate (and this has also been pointed out in the 
declaration regarding the joint work of the State Duma and 
legislative bodies) the conference will result in the creation 
of a coordinating body to formulate a unified strategy in the 
sphere of legislation and the creation of an informational 
system extending to Federation components to keep track of and 
coordinate all stages of lawmaking activity.

<F P=106> [Article by Observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Week's </F>
Topic" rubric: "Battle for the Budget: The Argument Over 
Figures Never Became a Debate on the Country's Security 
Problems"] 
  [Text] The past political week in Russia must have really 
delighted pedantic champions of parliamentarianism. At last 
everything here was "as with other people." I mean the heated 
budget battles in the Federal Assembly, which centered, as is 
proper, on defense spending. 
  If we disregard the results and the fact that the figures 
approved by the State Duma for the military budget bring the 
Armed Forces to the verge of mere survival or even push them 
beyond it, the very fact of this debate must, at first sight, 
provide definite grounds for optimism. Our parliamentarians 
have finally realized that they can influence the country's 
development -- and influence it perfectly really -- not through 
endless arguing over political questions. But the way this is 
done in all civilized countries -- through the budget. 
Throughout the world, by allocating or not allocating money 
under a particular heading to a particular government program, 
the people's elected representatives shape the state policy 
which they deem necessary. 
  In this context the present difficulties of the defense 
department and of our military industry would seem to be on a 
par with those encountered by the military department and the 
military-industrial complex of, let us say, the United States. 
The Pentagon always gets less than it asks for. But, alas, the 
similarity here seems purely superficial, a similarity of 
procedure and form, certainly not one relating to the crux of 
the matter. For, at least in the perception of the public, the 
heated parliamentary fighting centered on highly abstract 
figures. It turned out that 37 trillion rubles [R] was arguing 
with R55 trillion. 
  And yet fundamentally different approaches lie behind these 
figures. Not even approaches to the future fate of the Army, 
for which undying love is sworn by all Russian politicians (who, 
it is true, forget that the Army must not only be loved but also 
fed). I am talking of approaches to ensuring the country's 
security. 
  So the Ministry of Defense, relying on the main provisions 
of 
the military doctrine, having reckoned up the possible threats 
to our security, and mindful of the problems facing the Armed 
Forces and of Russia's international obligations, formed a 
certain military budget. The Ministry of Finance disagreed with 
it, which apparently is normal. At the same time the approach 
itself was formulated in a fundamentally different way: We will 
give as much money as we can, based on the state's assumed 
income. The Duma inclined toward the second approach. This, 
taking the state of our economy into account, would also be 
understandable in general. But for one highly material 
circumstance. 
  Parliament failed to take the next step, which was 
absolutely 
essential in that situation. Namely, it did not, as far as I 
know, assume the responsibility of deciding just how, in fact, 
the Ministry of Defense should dispose of the funds allocated 
and what it should renounce. In giving this money to the Army, 
it was necessary to say honestly: It is the State Duma -- an 
organ of legislative power -- and not the "notorious 
bureaucrats" of the Ministry of Defense which, owing to the 
economic situation, is depriving servicemen of a considerable 
proportion of the privileges that were granted them previously. 
In giving this money to the Army, parliament should have 
acknowledged that for the same reason soldiers would be fed and 
clothed worse. The legislature should also have assumed 
responsibility for the fact that considerably fewer apartments 
than planned would be constructed. Consequently, with the 
legislators' blessing many units and formations being withdrawn 
from Germany and the Baltic republics would be housed out in the 
open. 
  Moreover, precisely the parliamentarians should have taken 
the trouble to decide who, essentially, was to abandon combat 
training and where, and who was to make the switch exclusively 
to guarding storehouses and military installations and to 
mothballing military property. For it is perfectly obvious that 
it is impossible, within the framework of the funds being 
allocated, to maintain the combat readiness of all units, 
formations, and districts. 
  That is, in adopting such a budget, parliament should have 
recognized that not even the minimum requirements of all the 
Armed Forces would be satisfied. And defined the vitally 
important elements of the country's security structure which it 
considers it necessary to finance, as well as the less important 
ones which can be abandoned. And assumed responsibility for 
those decisions. There should have been a debate on those 
priorities, not about abstract figures. But there was not. 
  Instead, the opinion was widespread that the military was 
sabotaging reforms in the Armed Forces, which is why the Army 
cannot manage on the funds allocated to it. All this talk is 
painfully reminiscent of what our leaders were saying about 
conversion at the end of the eighties. Conversion, they said, 
will not only provide the military-industrial complex with work 
but will also give a boost to the entire country's development. 
The only hindrance is the sluggish thinking of the corps of 
directors. Something else was and still is a hindrance: A 
reluctance to understand that any reform, be it conversion of 
military production or Army reform, requires huge additional 
funds. 
  And yet those who sit in the State Duma are certainly not 
naive. There are sufficient qualified economists there to be 
aware of the obvious. But for some reason they prefer not to 
talk about real, basic problems. There can be just one 
explanation for this, although it is not quite pleasant for the 
legislators. They do not believe that the budget is realistic. 
They do not believe that, by discussing it, they are really 
financing a particular aspect of the state's life. 
  They believe that the government will fail to secure the 
income on which it is reckoning. If this is so, then the crumbs 
that are gathered up will be distributed "on a current basis," 
i.e. according to the method of stopping holes. In this case 
all debate resembles the torments of one of Zhvanetskiy's 
characters. The one who agonized over whether to buy crayfish 
at "yesterday's R5" or "today's R3," when he neither had R5 
yesterday nor has R3 today. Then, in discussing the military 
budget, it is hardly worth going deeply into such complex 
matters as defense capability. Then it becomes clear why the 
budget's approval became a field for interparty intrigues, loud 
statements, and overt politicking. It follows from this that 
our politicians, alas, have not matured to the point of real 
parliamentarianism, which embodies, above all, responsibility 
for the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Draft Plan for New </F>
Collectivization Appears in State Duma"] 
  [Text] The Russian State Duma Agrarian Affairs Committee 
has prepared a new version of the Russian Federation draft law 
"On Agricultural Cooperatives" which, if adopted, could nullify 
the entire agrarian reform. 
  The preparation of the law on agricultural cooperatives has 
been like a detective story developing over many months. The 
draft of the document was elaborated by a group of well-known 
economists and lawyers, writers of many works on theory and 
legal questions of cooperatives and the world cooperative 
movement. It was relevant a year ago. If the law had appeared 
then, it would have been possible to obviate many problems and 
difficulties in the formation of the new body of peasant 
entrepreneurs, legalize cooperation among farmers, and ease the 
countryside's financial problems. But the draft law met with 
serious resistance on the part of defenders of the kolkhoz 
sustem, since the foundations of this system were being finally 
undermined. We have talked on more than one occasion about the 
travails of this document, which made a laborious passage 
through various bodies and then went no one knows where. 
  Finally, all the hurdles were apparently overcome. The draft 
obtained the approval not only of leading experts, including 
foreign ones, but also of the Agriculture Ministry Council on 
Agrarian Policy and the government and was recommended for 
consideration in the State Duma. 
  Then came a further surprise. Yet another draft appeared, 
one submitted by the State Duma Agrarian Committee. Unlike its 
predecessor, this version will apparently not be impeded on the 
path to approval. Our information is that it is to be examined 
by the lower chamber in the very near future. 
  But the document is very surprising. Much of it is a rehash 
of the first version -- in the wording and some theoretical 
postulates. But these are interspersed with elements that not 
only contradict the rehashed articles, but nullify them. 
  The first article of the draft, for example, says that 
agricultural cooperatives in Russia only existed as such before 
collectivization, yet the fourth article places kolkhoz and 
cooperative on a par with one another. Moreover, it proposes 
that the kolkhoz be legalized in its most classic, Soviet form: 
"The owner's rights to shares of land and property pass to the 
kolkhoz (cooperative) as a corporate body that manages them in 
accordance with statutes which are formalized by an act of state 
after its registration." 
  This means that peasants will effectively have their shares 
of land and property taken away from them and so-called 
kolkhoz-cooperative ownership (joint property belonging to no 
one) will live again. It also marks the revival of the 
long-forgotten Partnerships for Joint Working of the Land and 
the fabrication of "cooperative farms," a concept unknown to 
world theory and practice. This law, if adopted, will provide 
the defenders of the kolkhoz system with a powerful legal weapon 
for new collectivization, for halting the reforms, and for 
strangling private farming. 
  This is not the first attempted legislative assault on the 
reform of the countryside. Only recently a draft law was 
proposed on collective agricultural enterprises. It did not get 
through. Now we have a new assault, perhaps the most serious.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Gondusov and Mikhail </F>
Shevtsov] 
  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Chechen officials have 
described today's operation to localise and disarm rebellious 
groups which led to bloodshed in Groznyy as "internal score 
settling." 
  Chechen law enforcement bodies stormed the buildings seized 
by rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov who organised a mutiny 
against Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's rule. Casualties 
were reported on both sides. 
  Such an outcome had long been foreseen by Chechen leaders 
who 
repeatedly insisted on the disarmament of illegal groupings. 
Last Saturday, Groznyy's military commandant ordered the 
leaders of illegal armed groups to surrender and hand in their 
arms. 
  The National Security Department officially charged one of 
the most influential field commanders Ruslan Labazanov with 
destabilising the situation in the republic. Labazanov once 
served as Dudayev's adviser but later the Chechen leader 
distanced himself from Labazanov who is now said to be in charge 
of a group of several hundred people. 
  The rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov equipped with 
firearms and seven armoured vehicles marched to the centre of 
the city this past weekend and presented a list of demands to 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and his government. The 
government unsuccessfully tried to settle the conflict through 
negotiations, but after long and fruitless debates rebels opened 
fire on the headquarters of the National Security Department and 
attempted to stage a rally on the central square. 
  By 4 a.m. presidential forces sealed off the rebels in one 
of 
the districts of the city and after a long fight involving 
armoured vehicles stormed four five-storey houses they occupied. 
  About 15 to 20 people were wounded on both sides. The 
government troops lost eight people, including the commander of 
a task-force unit, Khamzat Khankarov. 
  One of the rebel leaders, Suleymanov, was arrested and 
hospitalised in a critical condition. The fate of Labazanov 
remains unknown. The search for the rest is underway. 
  The Chechen Government is holding an emergency session to 
discuss the situation and ways to normalise it. 
  Informed sources said that the opposition of the Nadterechny 
and other "rebellious" districts was not involved in the 
incident. 
  Commenting on the situation in the republic, Yaragi 
Mamodayev, leader of the government of "Popular Trust" who was 
recently banished from the republic, stressed that Dudayev has 
no other alternative but national reconciliation. 
  Mamodayev calls for forming a coalition government which he 
is ready to head and for the soonest Russian-Chechen talks. 
  "We do not want confrontation or opposition between the 
Chechen people. We call for reconciliation and a political 
dialogue," he said.

  [Text] Grozny [Groznyy] June 14 ITAR-TASS--The situation 
remains tense in Chechnya, where several people were killed and 
injured on Monday in fighting between police and an armed group 
led by Ruslan Labazanov. The precise amount of victims from 
both sides has not been reported. Practically none of the 
political parties and movements in opposition to Dzhokhar 
Dudayev claimed responsibility for the clash. 
  The Labazanov group has been acting openly on the territory 
of Chechnya for nearly a year and declared in the official media 
its claims to be regarded as a political party. 
  The location of the leader of the group who managed to 
escape 
on Monday with several of his supporters has not been identified 
yet. The police admits the fact that he is now particularly 
dangerous as a source and instigator of terror. 
  Russia's plenipotentiary envoy Schmidt Zablayev is expected 
to arrive in Chechen capital on Tuesday where he will try to 
re-establish dialogue between Moscow and Grozny, but few people 
believe his mission will be effective.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from the "Inform" column: "Dzhokhar </F>
Has No Enemies Any Longer"] 
  [Text] Four citizens of Chechnya suspected of an attempt 
on the life of President Dzhokhar Dudayev were arrested in 
Groznyy in the early hours of Thursday morning. As Sultan 
Geliskhanov, head of the Chechen State Security Department, 
informed INTERFAX, this group is suspected of preparing a series 
of attempted assassinations of a number of top officials of the 
republic. 
  Remote-controlled plastic explosive devices and firearms 
were 
seized from the arrestees, INTERFAX was informed at the State 
Security Department. 
  The attempted assassination of Dudayev occuurred on 27 May, 
when a Zhiguli packed with explosives parked by the side of the 
road was detonated as a convoy of vehicles, including the 
president, approached Groznyy. The internal affairs minister 
and his deputy were killed as a result. Dudayev himself was not 
hurt.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 13 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Issues relating 
to settling relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia and 
the return of refugees to their previous residence were 
discussed at a meeting in Vladikavkaz today between Akhsarbek 
Galazov, president of North Ossetia, and Shmidt Dzoblayev, 
secretary general of the Assembly of Democratic Forces of the 
Northern Caucasus. The latter briefed Akhsarbek Galazov on his 
meeting in Nazran today with Ruslan Aushev, president of the 
Ingush republic, during which the issue of seeking a path to 
peace and accord in the region was discussed. 
  The leader of the movement proposed that a conference of the 
elders and religious authorities of the region on reconciliation 
should be held soon within the framework of stabilizing the 
situation in the conflict zone with the mediation of the 
Assembly of Democratic Forces of the Northern Caucasus. In his 
opinion, this would make it possible to create real 
prerequisites for implementing the 30th May decree of the 
Russian president "On Introducing a State of Emergency on Part 
of the Territories of the Republic of North Ossetia and the 
Ingush Republic." 
  The Assembly's secretary general also discussed with 
Akhsarbek Galazov the issue of relations with the Chechen 
republic, of involving its leader in the work of the commission 
to regulate Ossetia-Ingush relations and also of his plans 
connected with the forthcoming meeting with Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
leader of Chechnya. 
  Shmidt Dzoblayev said that Groznyy intends to examine 
relations between Chechnya and Russia, relating to regulating 
talks with its leadership and to the role of Chechnya in 
establishing law and order, peace, and calm in the region.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Grigorenko: "There Were No Surprises"] </F>
  [Text] The 20th Special Session of the Tatarstan 
Supreme Soviet, which ended Wednesday, did not bring any 
surprises. 
  This time our parliament demonstrated unprecedented 
efficiency -- only three days were required to consider a broad 
range of questions and to adopt a number of very important draft 
laws. 
  This, of course, does not mean that all documents were 
passed 
with a "hurrah." As before, differences were observed in the 
positions of the people's representatives, although this time 
they spoke, in the main, not for parliamentary factions, but for 
themselves personally. 
  The most eloquent discussion revolved around two draft laws: 
The question in the first concerned giving the president of our 
republic additional powers in connection with the socioeconomic 
situation that has developed, and in the second -- extending the 
law of the Tatarstan Republic "On Extraordinary Measures in the 
Fight Against Crime" to 1 January 1995. 
  As could be expected, not all of the deputies perceived with 
optimism the new formulation that was heard the day before in 
the speech of the president of the Tatarstan Republic. But he, 
in particular, noted that it was necessary for the government to 
develop a state program of economic and social progress for the 
Tatarstan Republic by October of this year. Some of the 
representatives of the deputy corps were troubled by the fact 
that the title of the future document makes no mention about the 
crisis. But the "additional powers" for leaders of the republic 
were at times classified as an encroachment on the age-old 
rights of parliamentarians. However, Chairman of the Tatarstan 
Republic Supreme Soviet Farid Mukhametshin gave the following 
explanation: Legislative guarantees of reforms are needed 
quickly, but the Supreme Soviet, not working on a professional 
basis, is not yet in a condition to react quickly to changes in 
the socioeconomic situation. 
  Debates regarding "the additional powers" were continued 
almost for the entire next day of the 20th Special Session of 
the Tatarstan Republic Supreme Soviet. Two drafts of the future 
law were brought to the attention of the deputies: One was from 
the Cabinet of Ministers, and the other -- from a group of 
members of the Supreme Soviet. The first document stated that 
"before the adoption of appropriate laws that regulate 
budget-financial economic, social, and administrative spheres of 
the Tatarstan Republic, grant the president of the Tatarstan 
Republic the right to publish edicts on the enumerated 
questions." And the second -- "grant the president of the 
Tatarstan Republic the right to publish edicts that regulate the 
legal relations in the social and economic spheres of the 
Tatarstan Republic." But here the period of validity of the law 
was established at up to 1 January 1995. 
  The views of the speakers on this question differed. Even 
the members of the "Sovereignty of the People" faction did not 
display their customary unanimity. Thus, Ildus Sultanov 
declared that this document in any wording will violate the 
principles of the constitutional system. But Zinnur Latypov, in 
his turn, thinks that, under the conditions that have developed, 
it is necessary to adopt edicts, but that it is desirable at the 
same time to have the active participation of expert advice. In 
the opinion of Yuriy Reshetov, the Treaty Between Russia and 
Tatarstan changed the political situation in many ways, but it 
is hardly likely that the Supreme Soviet in its present 
composition is capable of publishing appropriate laws. 
  After weighing all of the pros and cons, the people's 
deputies, nevertheless, adopted a variant with additions that 
was proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  In order to make changes to the law of the Tatarstan 
Republic 
"On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight Against Crime," whose 
period of validity expires within three weeks, a roll call vote 
was necessary. But the people's deputies first familiarized 
themselves with an exhibit of special means purchased for hard 
currency for militia employees (incidentally, the armored 
personnel carriers in photos in yesterday's IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA 
are part of this exhibit) and listened to information of Deputy 
Prime Minister Sergey Kirilov and Minister of Internal Affairs 
Iskander Galimov. It is now known from competent sources that 
crime has been reduced since the beginning of this year in the 
republic as a whole, the number of grave crimes has dropped, and 
the number of violent attacks, robberies, and thefts of state 
and personal property has fallen.... The cited figures, 
perhaps, are the most substantial argument in favor of extending 
the action of the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight 
Against Crime." What is more, new "varieties" of crimes have 
appeared -- "showdowns" among groups, the apartment racket, and 
contract murders.... The authors of 400 telegrams that were 
addressed to the Supreme Soviet reminded the parliamentarians of 
the need to extend the action of the law. 
  Of course, it is good when "our militia protects us," 
displaying a higher degree of vigilance than before. And, 
nevertheless, it was impossible not to lend an ear to the 
alternative speeches of a number of deputies who spoke 
convincingly about the fact that the constitutional rights of 
citizens have been violated more than once. For example, more 
than 2,500 persons were detained for 30 days, but criminal 
charges were brought against barely half of them. But the rest 
"learned" from their bitter experience with what "extraordinary 
measures" are fraught. In addition, the law enforcement organs 
will have to be content with a small "catch": Until the law "On 
Corruption" is passed, the big "fish" feels safe. Despite these 
and other costs, the majority of the deputies came to the 
conclusion that the law "On Extraordinary Measures in the Fight 
Against Crime" is still necessary; and, therefore, the term of 
its validity was extended to next year. 
  The three days of work by the parliamentarians did not 
present any kinds of surprises. All stayed with their interests 
and in their positions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the 
government. Rumors about impending replacements in the 
government were not confirmed. The matter was restricted only to 
unimportant caustic deputy remarks aimed at the executive 
branch. Prime Minister Mukhamat Sabirov responded to one of 
these "attacks" with the repartee: "If we had a professional 
parliament, it would not be necessary to undertake any kind of 
extraordinary measures."

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Belarusian Supreme Soviet Commission for 
International Affairs and External Economic Relations held a 
session on 13 June dedicated to the issue of the railroad 
station at Hadutsishki on the Belarusian-Lithuanian border. As 
we all know, the station was built by Belarus in 1979, during 
the construction of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Moscow 
then subordinated the station to the Lithuanian Railroads. 
After the collapse of the USSR, Lithuania obtained possession 
of the station. The latter, however, is located on Belarusian 
territory and belongs to us, Belarus. Commission Chairman Ivan 
Tsyareshka spoke at the session. 
  [Begin Tsyareshka recording] The negotiations have been 
unjustifiable dragging on for too long. It is difficult to 
resolve certain issues with Lithuania -- not just the border 
issue, but also that of Belarusian property located on 
Lithuanian territory. Meanwhile, we are successfully resolving 
similar problems with our other neighbors, including Latvia, 
Ukraine, and other republics. [passage omitted] 
  Tension is growing on a daily basis. We have found ourselves 
in an absurd situation: Belarusian freight trains are moving 
along Belarusian rails, but the Lithuanian side collects all the 
payments just because those trains pass through a small station 
named Hadutsishki. Sound thinking has always been part of the 
Belarusian mentality, but we must uphold our interests. [end 
recording] 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Stanislaw Ahurtsow, head of the 
delegation, pointed out that the Lithuanian side is purposefully 
raising a hue and cry over Hadutsishki. 
  [Begin Ahurtsow recording] [passage omitted] It will be very 
difficult to resolve this issue at the level of delegations. We 
must engage both the legislature and the government. Here I 
have the diplomatic note that was sent to the Lithuanian side on 
10 June. Let me read it: The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has 
learned from competent sources that at the [words indistinct] 
maintenance section, the Lithuanian side is dismantling railroad 
tracks and embankments and shipping them out of Belarusian 
territory. The ministry voices its protest against such actions 
by the Lithuanian side and views them as an encroachment on the 
property of the Republic of Belarus. The ministry believes that 
these actions will be immediately discontinued and the railroad 
tracks restored. The Belarusian side reserves the right to take 
appropriate measures to protect its property. [end recording] 
  The commission produced a draft resolution to be submitted 
for approval by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. The resolution 
envisions that by 1 September 1994 all the tracks on Belarusian 
territory, currently used by the Lithuanian side, be transferred 
under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Railroads. It was 
decided to suggest that the Council of Ministers consider the 
possibility of building a parallel track at this section of the 
Belarusian Railroads.

    [Editorial Report] Minsk BTK Television Network in 
Belarusian at 1700 GMT on 9 June carries a 40-minute program in 
the "Rostrum of the Candidate for the Presidency of the Republic 
of Belarus" series, which is devoted to presenting the platform 
of Vasil Novikaw, the Belarusian Communist Party's candidate for 
president. The program is moderated by Ala Ustsina, and a chief 
legal adviser and a member of the Central Electoral Commission 
are also in attendance. The program consists of a live segment 
with Novikaw, and a recorded video portraying Novikaw as family 
and public man. Questions, both live and recorded, are posed to 
Novikaw by unidentified journalists. Novikaw speaks in Russian 
throughout the program. 
  Touching upon political issues, Novikaw states that all the 
misfortunes of the people began with the "Moscow events of 1991" 
and the agreement in the Belavezha forest, where the "great 
three ruined the great country -- the Soviet Union." The 
Communist Party of Belarus, which put forward his candidacy, 
speaks for the "building of authentic socialism -- a society of 
social justice," Novikaw says. He voices assurances that "the 
mistakes of the past will not be repeated by Communists in the 
future." 
  Asked about differences between the Communists and other 
political forces in Belarus, Novikaw says that these differences 
can be seen as "ways and methods for obtaining a common goal -- 
the welfare of Belarus." Novikaw assures that the Communists do 
not want to "expropriate" private property after coming into 
power "again," but they will give priority to the state form of 
ownership in those branches of the national economy, which are 
"vitally important" to the maintenance of society as a whole. 
He adds that in other areas of economic activity -- for 
example, in trade and services -- private forms of property and 
business will be admissible. 
  Discussing the problem of responsibility for the current 
economic situation in Belarus, Novikaw states that, beginning 
1991, the power in Belarus was in the hands of "non-Communists," 
who dominated both the government and the Supreme Soviet. 
According to Novikaw, Communists -- that is, members of the 
current Communist Party of Belarus -- comprise only 20 percent 
of the current Supreme Soviet. The government and the Supreme 
Soviet, he affirms, are dominated by members of the "party of 
power." He argues that the Communists are capable of managing 
the economy efficiently. Novikaw cites China as an example to 
support this claim. 
  Asked about possibly abandoning his candidacy in favor of 
Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, Novikaw answers in the 
negative and adds that he has been obliged by his party to "go 
to the end" of his presidential campaign. 
  At the end of the program, Novikaw promises that in a few 
days he will publish his propositions, with regard to reforms in 
the Armed Forces, in local newspapers.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Marina Ivanova; from the </F>
"Segodnya" program] 
  [Text] [Ivanova] The presidential election campaign in 
Belarus is taking place to the accompaniment of scandals and 
attempts to find out the attitudes of the candidates. One of 
the candidates standing on behalf of the Democratic Bloc, 
Stanislav Shushkevich, said in an interview to the Segodnya 
program: 
  [Begin Shushkevich recording] There is massive pressure on 
local authorities that they have to say that Vyacheslav Kebich 
is the most intelligent and talented. They have to be quiet 
about the fact that he has, on the whole, brought the Republic 
to economic collapse. [end recording] 
  [Ivanova] A special Monitoring Council made up of famous 
journalists and lawyers has been set up in the Central Electoral 
Commission for the first presidential elections in order to 
ensure equal opportunities for candidates to use the mass media. 
Inter alia this council has noted three unplanned appearances 
by presidential candidate Vyacheslav Kebich on 2, 3, and 4 June. 
These were not just appearances by the prime minister, but also 
contained elements of his election campaign. Other candidates 
did not have this opportunity, an official statement from the 
Monitoring Council says. 
  Apart from this, in certain parts of the Republic on 11 
June, 
an appearance by Stanislav Shushkevich live on national radio 
was unexpectedly disrupted. Instead of a dialogue with the 
former parliament speaker, the listeners had to listen to a 
monotonous reading of provincial news. 
  Another scandal has broken out around Aleksandr Lukashenko. 
A truck from Latvia was detained by Belarus customs in the town 
of Braslav. The truck contained printed material supporting 
Lukashenko's candidature--65,000 color posters and 250,000 
pamphlets produced by the German firm of Supra from Hanover. 
The customs officers put the value of the load at 100 million 
rubles, although the documents said just nine million. The law 
on presidential elections forbids any direct or indirect 
participation by foreign firms or individuals in the 
organization or conducting of the elections. All financial 
provisions come from the state budget.

  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 14 June TASS -- President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has taken new steps to 
accelerate market reforms and pull his republic out of the 
economic crisis. The local press today carries decrees of 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev aimed at major restructuring of 
the Republic's ministries and scrapping some of them altogether. 
  The abolished Ministries of Foreign Economic Relations, 
Industry and Trade will be replaced by one single Ministry of 
Industry and Trade for purposes "of making a more effective use 
of the Republic's production potential and meeting market 
demand, as well as for purposes of entering international 
economic relations as soon as possible." 
  The Ministry of Transport and Communications will take over 
from two other abolished ministries, those of transport and 
communications, which is expected to cut spending on the upkeep 
of state government bodies and streamline their operations. 
  On the other hand, the Ministry of Energy and Fuel resources 
is now divided into two ministries, the Ministry of the Oil and 
Gas Industry and the Ministry of Energy and the Coal Industry to 
ensure a more effective implementation of the state policy in 
the use of the republic's fuel and energy potential as a major 
precondition for accelerating the social and economic 
development of all of its regions. 
  The chairman of the National Bank is given a more 
independent 
status in pursuing the monetary and crediting policy. He will 
no longer be a member of the cabinet.

ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulagin] 
  [Text] Almaty, 13 June -- The two countries stand to 
mutually benefit most from cooperation between Kazakhstan and 
Vietnam in the sphere of agriculture, oil-extraction, mining, 
and textile industries. This was noted today during talks 
between Sergey Tereshchenko, the prime minister of Kazakhstan, 
and Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister of Vietnam, who is in Almaty 
on an official visit. Earlier in the day the Vietnamese prime 
minister was received by the President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  The talks stressed that getting bilateral trade between 
Vietnam and Kazakhstan going promises prompt results. 
  In the opinion of the head of government of Kazakhstan, when 
attracting foreign investors, both countries should take into 
account the interests of the third party. From his point of 
view, the creation of joint enterprises in both countries, the 
exchange of scientific potential and mutual assistance in 
training cadres in specialities in short supply would be of 
indubitable benefit. 
  For his part, the Vietnamese prime minister proposed to set 
up an intergovernment commission for economic cooperation, this 
was perceived with interest. 
  After the talks a joint intergovernment statement was 
signed. 
  Today Kazakhstan-Vietnamese consultations were held within 
the framework of the premier's visit at the local foreign 
ministry. The heads of the foreign political departments of 
both countries, namely Kanat Saudabayev and Nguyen Manh Cam, 
reached an accord on interaction in the Asian process, in 
particular, for the purpose of implementing the initiative of 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev on ensuring security on the 
continent.

  [Text] On Sunday [12 June] evening a Vietnamese Government 
delegation arrived on an official visit to Almaty led by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. At the airport, the delegation was 
welcomed by Prime Minister Tereshchenko and other officials. 
This morning, at the residence of the president of Kazakhstan, 
intimate talks were held between Nazarbayev and Vo Van Kiet. 
During the meeting it was noted that today the task is of not 
only restoring, but significantly broadening on a mutually 
beneficial basis of earlier existing ties between the two 
countries. The transition to a market economy is not simple, 
said the head of our state, and Kazakhstanis are interested in 
the experience of Vietnam in the restructuring of their economy. 
  Exchange of opinions showed that the stance of the sides 
coincides on many foreign political issues. In particular, the 
leadership of Vietnam absolutely supports the initiative of the 
president of Kazakhstan on the convocation of a conference on 
interaction and confidence-building measures in Asia, and is 
contributing to its implementation. No obstacles exist for 
development of bilateral relations, Vo Van Kiet said. They will 
facilitate a more successful overcoming of hardships that both 
states have. 
  On behalf of the president of Vietnam, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet invited Nazarbayev to visit Vietnam on an official visit at 
his convenience. The head of Kazakhstan expressed his 
gratitude. Prime Minister Tereshchenko, his deputies Syzdyk 
Abishev and Galym Abilseitov, Foreign Minister Saudabayev, and 
other officials participated in the talks. 
  This afternoon, Prime Minister Tereshchenko held talks with 
Vo Van Kiet. He discussed those fields of cooperation that 
promise the best mutual benefit. The head of the Kazakh 
Government stressed the necessity of attracting foreign 
investors, taking into account interests of a third party. 
Investing foreign capitals in Kazakh industry, Kazakhstan could 
take care of Vietnam's interests, and Vietnam could take care of 
Kazakh interests. The Vietnamese prime minister put forward a 
proposal to set up an intergovernmental commission on economic 
cooperation. The Kazakh side received this proposal with 
interest. 
  As result of the talks a joint intergovernmental communique 
was signed. The outcome of the first working day of the visit 
of the Vietnamese delegation was summed up at a news conference 
held by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. Within the 
framework of the visit to Kazakhstan of Vo Van Kiet, the prime 
minister of Vietnam, the Kazakh-Vietnamese consultations were 
held at the Foreign Ministry. The ministers agreed to develop a 
constant dialogue in order to maintain Kazakh-Vietnamese 
relations on a proper level.

  [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] -- The president of 
the Republic of Kazakhstan has addressed the Republican Supreme 
Council with this message: [passage omitted] 
  A short while ago -- two and a half years ago -- Kazakhstan, 
as well as all the other CIS countries, began its policy of 
implementing radical market reforms, and since then it has 
achieved considerable success in introducing market reforms. 
The old system's foundations have already been demolished. 
Transformations are now irreversible. 
  We have also demolished the old system of management and 
production, the centralized distribution of resources, material 
benefits, and labor. On the whole, we have introduced a change 
from guided price formation to a free pricing practice that 
reflects sales opportunities. The state will regulate only a 
small list of the socially important goods and services. 
  The state has eliminated restrictions with regard to wages 
in 
the production sphere and services. The "Iron Curtain" in 
foreign trade has been eliminated and demonopolization has been 
carried out. The influx of foreign investments to the country's 
economy has considerably increased. The radical reform of the 
budget and banking system is continuing, with a view of adapting 
them to civilized norms. The loan capital and currency markets 
are being created, labor and housing markets are expanding. 
  We are changing our view on property. At present, the 
process of dismantling of state ownership is quite active and 
conditions are created for further privatization of state 
enterprises. 
  The institution of private property is being granted the 
same 
kind of rights as the state in terms of economic relations and 
public attitude. [passage omitted] 
  At present, Kazakhstan is living through an extremely 
difficult social and economic crisis, which is unique in a 
sense. First, crisis is something that accompanies any market 
economy. All the developed countries, at one stage or another, 
had to face it. The main thing is to minimize its consequences, 
speed up the rate of lifting the country's economy out of this 
crisis. Nobody ever succeeded in escaping it. Unfortunately, 
we had to start with a crisis stage. 
  Second, Kazakhstan has gained its sovereignty at a time of 
obvious crisis manifestations, caused by deficiencies in the 
administrative methods of economy management, which have 
exhausted themselves. 
  Third, the crisis that we are living through has been caused 
by the disintegration of the old economic system and the need to 
establish a new one. [passage omitted] The main reason for the 
deepening crisis is the disintegration of the USSR. 
Kazakhstan's economy, on the day of it gained independence was 
a part of the powerful and monolithic economy of the USSR, which 
used to fulfill its own local tasks. [passage omitted] 
  We also inherited an unbalanced trade balance, especially 
with Russia. In 1990 we imported produce worth 18 billion 
rubles (in prices of that time) and exported goods worth half of 
this sum. This negative balance is now being treated as the 
state debt of the country, which affects the state budget. 
Under the worsening financial situation, under the conditions 
of the open market and with prices for fuel approaching the 
world level, Kazakhstan has overproduced such commodities as 
meat, phosphorus, fertilizers, tractors, cement, and others. 
The market for Kazakhstan's goods is restricted mainly by the 
CIS space. Consumers, both domestic and internal, have become 
more choosy in selecting goods, taking into account both 
quality, quantity, and price. The volumes of production of the 
once strategically important types of goods exceed the domestic 
needs of the country. Due to their quality and absence of 
experience in foreign market's trading they do not have a 
reliable and stable market outside Kazakhstan. [passage omitted] 
  Animal husbandry in agriculture is inefficient with its high 
prices for forage and absence of selectivity [sentence as 
received]. We have extremely high volumes of grain production 
that exceed the needs of the country. The areas under crops are 
extremely large and, at the same time, we have low crop 
capacity. [passage omitted]. 
  Third [as received], [words indistinct] market forces have 
encouraged the creation and development of new sectors of 
economy, new economic businesses, and operations. They have 
filled the void and begun to bring the country's economy in 
compliance with new demands. At the preliminary stage, 
entrepreneurs channeled their efforts to the circulation sphere, 
as the most efficient for private business. Trade and the 
service sphere, which used to occupy a small place before, is 
being developed rapidly. [Word indistinct] an active process of 
redistribution of the capital and work force, a more flexible 
movement of commodity resources in accordance with the demands 
of the market economy have started as a result of appearance of 
[words indistinct] in some other spheres of the economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  We have compatible enterprises in all the spheres of 
economy, 
in order for them to survive and develop we need large 
investments, both external and internal. But all the long-term 
spendings are possible under one condition that the inflation 
rate will remain at a level not higher than 10 percent. The 
issue is to improve the economy financially. That will make 
internal investments possible. The population will have a 
stimulus for accumulating capital [words indistinct] and 
modernizing production. We need a tough financial policy by the 
National Bank, no matter how difficult this may be. There is no 
other alternative. 
  The efficiency of the market economy's policy and practical 
activity, which is being conducted by the government, apart from 
objective factors, is being impeded by certain unthoughtful 
steps and decisions, mistakes. [passage omitted] 
  The old parliament was too slow to follow the dynamics of 
the socio-economic and political processes. [Word indistinct] 
elaboration of laws, there were around 300 of them, have been 
too quick and done without approbation. Quite often deputies 
were used as machines for voting. At the same time, drafts of 
the certain legal acts on the most urgent problems of state and 
economic life have been left unexamined. Among them is the 
draft program of the legal reform that was submitted for 
consideration by the parliament two years ago. Its adoption 
would have helped to make considerable changes in this sphere 
and would not have made possible the acuteness of the 
constitutional reform problem. [passage omitted] The banking 
system has not been prepared to work under new conditions. 
Wide-scale and nonregulated liberalization of banking activity, 
unrestricted freedom of activity of commercial banks, imperfect 
legislation, and unprepared financial and credit policies of the 
state for the market economy's principles and conditions have 
resulted in the situation where negative tendencies became 
domineering. The fact that we are lagging behind with the 
reform in the banking system, slows down the adaptation of 
production to market conditions, its diversification, and the 
development of market forces. [passage omitted] 
  The government is too slow in tackling the topical issues, 
it 
has not elaborated the procedure and mechanism of bankruptcy. 
Its tax policy and practice, as well as its policy in many 
other issues is not up to the mark. The government has been 
slow in creating the market of securities, insurance policy, 
creating a civilized market infrastructure. There are a lot of 
serious problems in dismantling, managing state property and 
state owned enterprises. [passage indistinct]. 
  Society focuses its attention on Legislative and Executive 
Branches of power, ignoring judicial. At the same time, the 
court is the most important element in the defending rights and 
freedoms of people. The Judicial Branch of power in Kazakhstan 
has not yet found its place. [passage omitted] Recognizing the 
mistakes that have been made, we at the same time, should 
understand that Kazakhstan, its political and state leadership 
along with society, are in the process of learning, mastering 
the new, and implementing large-scale transformations. The 
situation in the country could have been worse. [passage 
indistinct]. 
  At the same time, political stability depends on the 
economic 
situation. Therefore, furthering the economic reform also 
becomes a political problem. [passage omitted] The moment that 
we are living through is illustrative in the sense that the old 
economic system has stopped being an integral system, and the 
roots of the new one are not yet strong enough. The only way of 
supporting them and stabilizing the economy is to facilitate 
rates of transformations. We should not waste our time. This 
will not make the situation easier, it will just elongate and 
over complicate things. Last year and the beginning of the 
present year have shown this vividly. We will still have to 
travel a long and difficult journey. The main thing is to draw 
our lessons from accumulated experience and make amends to the 
program of reforms. [passage indistinct] In general we know 
what to do next: These are the dismantling and privatization of 
state ownership, anti-inflationary policy, minimization of 
budget deficits and the positive balance of payments, 
introduction of a tough mechanism of bankruptcy, liberalization 
of prices, trade, and the creation of a competitive environment. 
The problem that the political leadership of the country is 
facing today is: A) Either to conduct the policy of reforms, as 
before and at the same rate, with due consideration taken of the 
available resources. It essentially means counting on our own 
resources and the introduction of maximum restrictions in the 
social sphere; or B) Taking into consideration the general 
situation, to choose something new and make amends to the 
current policy so as to ensure higher dynamism and efficiency of 
reforms. Until now we conducted the policy of minimizing the 
budget deficit, suppressing inflation, increasing taxes, and 
restricting spendings. Such a financial policy has contributed 
to a much quicker formation of market relation and, at the same 
time, has resulted in a crisis in the social sphere. The 
beginning of the current year has shown that reduction of 
spendings in this particular sphere has reached its limit, which 
is unacceptable by the population. Behind it is the degradation 
and disintegration of a number of branches of industry. [passage 
indistinct]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev gave a speech last 
Saturday [11 June] at a conference of foreign ministers held in 
Istanbul. He said in particular that Kazakhstan, from the very 
first days of its revived statehood, stands for the 
strengthening of international security and an atmosphere of 
confidence. The Kazakh leadership regards the country's 
participation in North Atlantic cooperation from this viewpoint. 
The preparation of the final documents was held in an 
atmosphere of tense debates, and the Kazakh delegation's 
amendment was introduced. As result, Paragraph 25 of the 
conference statement says: We welcome the fact that the Republic 
of Kazakhstan has joined the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation 
Treaty as a state that does not possess such weapons, and highly 
assess Kazakhstan's positive role in the process of dismantling 
the nuclear weapons of the former USSR in conformity with the 
Lisbon protocol. 
  On the same day Kanat Saudabayev met the foreign ministers 
of 
Germany, Greece, Canada, and Turkey. They touched upon topical 
regional and international problems and bilateral relations, as 
well as the further expansion of mutually beneficial trade and 
economic cooperation. The Kazakhstan delegation returned home.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>
  [Text] Almaty, 13 Jun -- A general strike in protest at the 
uncontrolled increase in fuel prices, which is causing 
production cutbacks, could be unleashed in Kazakhstan. 
Enterprises in the Republic's mining and metallurgical sector 
are in the worst trouble. The staff of these enterprises are 
being sent en masse on vacations for an indefinite period and, 
moreover, many have to go without vacation payments being made. 
The threat of unemployment is hanging over tens of thousands of 
blue- and white-collar staff in the East Kazakhstan Oblast. 
  Attempts made by the trade unions to persuade the government 
to set discount tariffs on the use of energy holders for 
fuel-intensive industries have come to nothing. At present 
energy holders have reached 70 percent of the cost prices in the 
production of titanium, zinc, lead, and other commodities. This 
has forced the enterprises to set prices for their goods at 
levels that are higher than world prices. 
  According to the trade union leader, Kazbek Valiyev, the 
working people have appealed to the president and the Supreme 
Council to dismiss the Republic's government. 
  The collectives of the oblast's enterprises, who have 
already 
set up strike committees, have no intention of retracting from 
the demands they have put forward. If the expected changes do 
not occur in the next few days, they intend to put forward an 
initiative for the staging of an all-republican protest strike. 
  Such an appeal could be upheld in the Republic where, at 
present, 1200 enterprises are standing idle.

  [Text] Pavlodar Oblast maslikhat deputies of the standing 
commission for social policy matters adopted an appeal to the 
Kazakh Supreme Council. It says the oblast inhabitants standard 
of living is decreasing, food and goods prices are rising 
unstably, and payments of wages and pension are not paid on 
time, especially for workers in education, medicine, and 
culture. It can be interpreted as a great violation of the 
Kazakh law on labor and pension, of which Kazakhstan has signed 
the human right declaration. Therefore, it demands the adoption 
of a decree by the Supreme Council on payment of wages, pension, 
and benefits. In case of delay in payment, the Supreme Council 
should also adopt a law to pay additionally for inflation.

  [Text] Yesterday at the house of government President Askar 
Akayev met heads of oblast, rayon, and town administrations. 
They discussed economic problems and hardships on the way to 
the market. In particular, the report presented by Akayev spoke 
about the poorly thought-out mechanism of settling payments 
between the branches of industry and enterprises. This 
negatively affects production and brings about a stop to work in 
plants and factories. Special attention was paid by Akayev and 
those who spoke during the discussion to agricultural issues. 
It was noted that owing to a timely allocation of a soft loan 
by the government, the spring field works were done in time. 
The fodder procurement campaign also began timely and in an 
organized way. Preparation for harvesting is in progress. The 
participants of the meeting outlined a number of concrete 
measures to improve work of the industry and agriculture.

  [Text] The emigration of the Russian population from 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] is a catastrophe not only for the 
Republic but for Russia as well, which is unable to receive 
hundreds of thousands of its countrymen, President Askar Akayev 
said in Bishkek. 
  Akayev recognized that the main motives for emigration were 
socio-political. In particular, the introduction of Kirghiz as 
the state language had pushed Russians out of many professional 
spheres. He also did not deny cases of discrimination in the 
entrepreneurial sphere and displays of everyday nationalism. 
  In Akayev's view, the outflow of experts from the Republic 
is 
causing irreparable damage to the republic's economy. Whereas 
in 1990 Russians accounted for more than 21 percent of the 
population, in four years their number has decreased to 17 
percent.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 14 June TASS -- Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] has 
mustered the best forces from among its military prosecutors, 
security service officers, tax inspectors, and finances [as 
received] to look into the allegations of corruption inside the 
Defence Ministry, which appeared in the local press. 
  Reporter of one of the local newspapers charged the leaders 
of the Defence Ministry with corruption and the desire to get 
rich at the expense of the Army. The Defence Ministry responded 
by publishing a statement saying that the Kanat project, 
mentioned by the reporter, was designed to help finance the 
Republic's armed forces. 
  According to Colonel Isayev, the sale of obsolete military 
equipment within the frame of the Kanat project earned the 
ministry about four million U.S. dollars, all of which went to 
create and maintain the Republic's new army. The army is paid 
from the state budget less than one fourth of the money it needs 
to operate normally.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe 13 June TASS -- The "SADO-I MARDUM" daily, 
an official newspaper of the Tajik parliament, has published a 
sensational exposure of "anti-popular and anti-state activities" 
of the Former Tajik Premier Abdumalik Abdullajanov, who is now 
Tajik ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the 
Russian Federation. 
  The article, which takes up two pages and a half, includes 
accusations against Abdullajanov for breaking down the country's 
economy, selling out national economy, scheming with hard 
currency for the sake of personal wealth and other crimes 
against Tajik people. 
  Moreover, the newspaper incriminates Abdullajanov - who was 
Tajik premier in 1992-93 and who was dismissed at a session of 
Tajik Parliament in December 1993, according to the official 
statement, "because he was appointed ambassador to the Russian 
Federation" -- political and economic support of the armed 
opposition. [passage as received] 
  The daily clearly suggests that Abdullajanov was mixed up in 
establishing economic blockade in the southern regions of the 
Republic during the armed stand-off between the opposition and 
those who supported restoration of the constitutional order. 
  The newspaper comes to a significant conclusion: The former 
prime minister is to blame for the troubles of the Tajik people 
and must be punished along with the former opposition leaders. 
  It is not known as yet, how the Dushanbe officialdom 
responds 
to the publication. According to a well-informed source inside 
the Tajik leadership, the response is sure to come. One thing 
is certain: competent bodies will check on the published facts 
most carefully, he added. 
  According to independent sources in Dushanbe, the article 
was 
published under the pressure from certain Tajik political forces 
(Abdullajanov has many foes in Tajikistan). 
  Despite his resignation, Abdullajanov is one of Tajikistan's 
prominent politicians and influential reformers; he is regarded 
in the Russian corridors of power and in Western business 
circles. 
  Moreover, it is persistently rumoured here that he is likely 
to run for president in accordance with a new Tajik draft 
Constitution. 
  Though the presidential rule in the republic has to be 
approved at the forthcoming referendum scheduled for the end of 
this summer, unofficial campaign for the highest governmental 
position has begun in point of fact.

  [Text] Yerevan, June 13 (SNARK)--The presidential governing 
is the only acceptable form for Armenia, considers the Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Speaking to the extraordinary 
session of the Armenian Parliament which was devoted to the 
discussion of the project of the new constitution, he said that 
the parliamentary system may be effective only in those 
countries where 2-3 powerful parties are established, and one of 
them takes the parliamentary majority. "Such parties may appear 
in Armenia only in dozens years. And even if we take we take 
the parliamentary governing, in some time we will have to come 
to the presidential governing but at the cost of greater 
trials", said the president. He also mentioned that Armenia has 
the unique chance to refuse from offering self-independence to 
the regions and build the "classic unitary state". 
  According to Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the official project of 
the new constitution reflects all the basic principles of the 
international law to let the republic overcome the 
inter-political crisis and civil war.

<F P=106> [Report by Serob Oganyan: "The Russian Peace Initiative </F>
Should Be Accepted by All Parties"] 
  [Text] As already reported, General of the Army Pavel 
Grachev, minister of defense of the Russian Federation, arrived 
in Yerevan on 8 June. 
  Judging by what the minister said, his arrival in the 
Transcaucasus and, in particular, in Armenia was brought about 
by three factors. The first--a number of military-political 
matters, which include the cooperation of the armed forces of 
Armenia and Russia and the accommodation of Russian military 
bases in Armenia and the solution in this connection of a number 
of administrative questions such as the number and location of 
these bases, has to be discussed with the president of Armenia. 
It is a question of one or, at the most, two bases, 
incidentally. The second--in connection with the start of the 
period of military exercises, the inspection of the Russian 
military units stationed on Armenian territory. And the 
third--after the visit to Tbilisi on 11 June, Pavel Grachev will 
fly to Baku for several hours. This came as a surprise to 
everyone since the decision was made directly prior to the 
departure from Moscow. The run-up to events is as follows: 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev requested this of Boris 
Yeltsin personally, and the latter, in turn, gave Pavel Grachev 
the appropriate directive. The minister himself said that he 
would attempt in these few hours to finally persuade the 
leadership of Azerbaijan to accept the Russian peace initiative. 
  Having stopped briefly at Reception House, the Russian 
minister set off for the meeting with Levon Ter-Petrosyan, 
president of Armenia. The talks took place behind closed doors. 
At the conclusion of the negotiations Pavel Grachev evaluated 
their results as satisfactory, saying, in particular: 
  "The most important thing is that we once again obtained 
from 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan confirmation that Armenia wishes 
to have Russian bases on its territory. We are within the 
framework of collective security to provide for the security of 
both Armenia and Russia...." 
  To a question by your RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA correspondent as 
to 
whether the question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict 
had been discussed, the minister replied: "Yes," and continued: 
  "The Armenian president once again supported unconditional 
compliance with the agreement worked out in Moscow. I will take 
these thoughts to Baku, where I shall propose that Geydar Aliyev 
sign this agreement." 
  "Will there be negotiations with the Karabakh side?" 
  "They are not anticipated...." 
  Yesterday the military inspectors toured Russian military 
units and by 1600 hours were to have gotten together with their 
summaries. Pavel Grachev said that it would be decided after 
this "what to reduce where, and what, on the contrary, to 
increase." He noted also that the bases quartered in Armenia 
would not, most likely, be fixed motorized bases but air-mobile 
bases. 
  "Levon Akopovich also agreed that within the framework of 
providing for security it was essential that we create a common 
air defense system," Mr. Grachev said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Stupishin, ambassador extraordinary </F>
and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation in the Republic of 
Armenia, by Armen Khanbabyan; place and date not given: "`I Have 
Felt at Home in Armenia'"] 
  [Text] [Khanbabyan] Vladimir Petrovich, what is it like 
for you working in our country? 
  [Stupishin] Excellent. I have complete mutual understanding 
with the leadership of Armenia, and there are contacts daily, 
which is an essential condition for productive work. I should 
say immediately, incidentally, that there are close relations 
also between all official authorities of our two states--at the 
parliamentary, governmental, ministerial, and departmental 
level. This is making it possible to decide a mass of urgent 
questions promptly. 
  What I have just said does not mean, of course, that 
everything is ideal. Moments of choppiness arise also, but they 
are quickly smoothed over to our mutual satisfaction, thanks to 
the fact that there are today no political problems between 
Russia and Armenia. 
  The climate for the operation of the Russian Embassy in 
Armenia is altogether highly favorable. I have felt at home here 
since day one. And not only among officials, I would say. The 
attitude toward Russia [word illegible] and toward me 
personally, as toward all the embassy staff, is [three words 
illegible] most warm and cordial in all circles of society. 
  [Khanbabyan] Well, this is good to hear. But certain 
difficulties also arise from time to time in this connection? An 
ambassador is exclusively an official, after all.... 
  [Stupishin] There are difficulties. And one of them is that 
it is hard for some people as yet to get used to the idea that 
the representative of Moscow is no longer the former "party 
Gauleiter," to whom it was possible to complain about the local 
authorities. Some people would clearly like to see me wearing 
this cap, and this is why some people are today disappointed. 
They are uncomfortable, as it were, with the absence of a 
"Gauleiter," with the fact that the times when it was possible 
to "run down" one's own people have gone, never to return. They 
would like me to put pressure on the leadership of the 
republic--de jure or, at least, de facto. Yet the diplomat's job 
is something else--to contribute to a strengthening and 
development of diverse and productive interstate relations. This 
is what we are working for. And some people would clearly like 
to see the ambassador of Russia "on their side," make him a 
participant in some internal political intrigues, and link him 
with some internal collisions. This is absolutely ruled out. I 
see as my job the realization of the interests of Russia in the 
host country. Of Russia, not this political force or grouping or 
the other. I believe that it is to the advantage of Moscow and 
Russians getting to know Armenia and the realities of the life 
of its people and their problems better. This will enable them 
to answer the question, "What do we need Armenia for," and will 
enable them to identify Armenia and Armenians as their sincere 
friends. This is the true state interest for both Russia and, I 
believe, for Armenia. 
  [Khanbabyan] It is no secret that in a number of republics 
of 
the former Union there are organizations of the so-called 
"Russian- speaking population" that, to put it mildly, are in 
none too benevolent a frame of mind with regard to the local 
authorities. It is known also that certain political circles in 
Russia are endeavoring to make use of these organizations in 
their own interests, thereby turning them, as it were, into a 
fifth column threatening the young independence of the new 
states.... 
  [Stupishin] I am categorically opposed to the inevitable 
difficulties of a socioeconomic order being experienced in the 
present transitional period by the new states of the near abroad 
being used by anyone at all for his own political ends. 
Manipulating the fate of millions of people by playing on 
difficulties and resuscitating a bankrupt ideology is the height 
of irresponsibility. Unfortunately, it is this that 
"national-patriotic" organizations like, for example, Ragozin's 
"Congress of Russian Communities" or Barkashov's Nazi Party are 
doing. I would note that it was at the instigation of the 
notorious "Congress..." that what is now called the "Russian 
Community of the Republic of Armenia" appeared in Armenia. 
Forgive me, but this is nonsense; declaring oneself a community 
is impossible! A national community takes shape historically and 
cannot have political characteristics. It is no accident that 
this notorious "Community" has nothing in common with the 
"Russia" Society--the largest, mass organization of Russians in 
Armenia. 
  I have to say, in general, that the difficulties that are 
affecting inhabitants of Armenia who are Russian by nationality 
(and we, the embassy, are endeavoring to the best of our 
abilities to minimize these difficulties) should and can be 
overcome only in cooperation with the government and the 
authorities of the republic. And we are aware of their support. 
  [Khanbabyan] But there are in Armenia, unfortunately, not 
only the "Russian Community" but also other, no less odious, 
organizations and personalities. While not ethnic Russians and 
having, as a rule, no real idea of present-day Russia and its 
people, they are insistently attempting, nonetheless, to play 
the part of that fifth column. I believe that in their 
unconcealed aspiration to discredit the existing authorities 
they have as of late overstepped certain bounds, namely, they 
have attempted to use in their unscrupulous political game the 
name of the Russian ambassador and to damage the prestige of the 
Russian state and its leadership. A clear example of this was 
the publication in GOLOS ARMENII of 2 June of this year. I 
believe that this publication did palpable damage to 
Armenian-Russian relations. What can you say in 
this connection? 
  [Stupishin] Well, first, I regard the said publication as a 
cheap and vulgar denunciation and a clumsy attempt to discredit 
me in the eyes of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Russian Federation and our national parliament. 
But these are idle endeavors. It is not for them to teach the 
authorities in Russia how they should evaluate the activity of a 
Russian diplomat. 
  The GOLOS authors lie when they claim that Russia is their 
home. Not Russia, merely a particular, and far from the best, 
part, what is more, of Russian society: neofascists of all 
stripes, revanchists, political gangsters--these are the Moscow 
friends of GOLOS ARMENII. This newspaper, which lays claim to 
the appellation "independent," has publicly taken the part of 
the most reactionary and most suspicious and regressive forces 
both in Armenia and in Russia. And I have the impression that 
the GOLOS authors are simply intoxicated with delight at their 
political choice. It is not fortuitous that personal assaults 
and attacks leveled not only against the president and 
government of Armenia but also of Russia are so frequent on the 
pages of this newspaper. Although "what is Hecuba to them," it 
would seem! Only now, finding it necessary to recall my 
interview of eight months ago, are they, without a moment's 
doubt, attempting to accuse me of having used "derogatory 
epithets" in respect to the Russian people--for having after the 
October putsch in Moscow openly called things by their proper 
name: gangsters--gangsters, fascists--fascists, and killers and 
provocateurs--killers and provocateurs. How should I have acted? 
Put the executioner and victim on the same footing? Treated 
equally the Barkashovite sniper and the innocent citizen that 
fell from his bullet? This would be the same as equating in 
"all-forgiveness" Talaat and Enver and the people they killed. 
  And what about the constant attempts to "privatize" Victory 
Day! Disgusting attempts, there is no other way to put it. It is 
as though these people forget that not only members of the 
Communist Party, but also peasant toilers ruined by 
collectivization and true patriots repressed by the regime--in a 
word, all to whom the fatherland is dear--fought and died for 
the motherland. And in this connection this article contains 
also an absolute lie in regard to me and my position. After all, 
both last year and this year we employees of the Embassy of the 
Russian Federation participated in conjunction with 
representatives of the civilian and military authorities of 
Armenia in solemn ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
and in other activities. And this was a splendid symbol of our 
friendship, our brotherhood in arms. I cannot imagine how 
General A. Kazaryan, whose signature stands beneath the 
publication in GOLOS ARMENII, could have "forgotten" this. It 
remains to be regretfully assumed that some forces and people 
who have never been anywhere near combat are cynically using the 
distinguished veteran--a hero and combat general--in their own 
interests and shamelessly manipulating his name. 
  The name of the holiday and its status is another matter. 
Each state decides these matters in its own way, independently. 
And the attempt by any methods to compel a diplomat to interfere 
in the internal affairs of the host country is unethical, 
therefore. 
  [Khanbabyan] GOLOS essentially accused you of neocolonialist 
manners, of allegedly undertaking to "lecture" the local press 
and public, and in an "offensive form," what is more, in a word, 
of behaving as the Moscow party emissary--the second secretary 
of the Central Committee--would not have dared to behave in the 
former times. But at the same time you are attempting here to 
play "the part of advocate for a bankrupt regime...." 
  [Stupishin] I do not know what the authors of the 
publication 
mean in speaking about "lectures" and so forth. After all, these 
people were simply not present at the Yerevan State University 
when I met the university's professorial and lecturer staff. In 
the apt expression of Anna Andreyevna Akhmatova, "They were not 
there." If for no other reason, they are not entitled, I 
believe, to make evaluations of my words in the course of a 
meeting or to comment on them. And I did not attempt, 
incidentally, to lecture anyone; I answered the questions put to 
me. It is GOLOS that is constantly attempting to lecture 
everyone, in the most pushy fashion, what is more, shifting the 
whole blame onto others, distorting the facts, and taking out of 
the context of a speech individual words and expressions, as 
they did, for example, in respect to my words concerning the 
possibilities of a solution of the Karabakh crisis. They 
probably greatly disliked the fact that I passed a comment on 
their newspaper without any great enthusiasm. Excuse me, but 
this is my right, the right of a reader. And, as ambassador, I 
may say objectively that many of the publications in GOLOS 
ARMENII, particularly that of 2 June 1994, do not contribute to 
the strengthening and development of Russian-Armenian relations 
and are sowing between the two peoples grains of hostility, 
hatred, and suspicion. Nor do they in any way serve a civilized 
solution of the tragic Karabakh conflict. 
  [Khanbabyan] Sowing hostility, hatred, suspicion--this is 
altogether highly characteristic of publications that adhere to 
neofascist, nationalist positions.... 
  [Stupishin] Yes, this, by all accounts, is precisely how 
they understand political struggle. They speculate on people's 
ignorance, their insufficient knowledgeability. And I can say 
plainly that many urgent matters for Armenia are being tackled 
today with the help of Russia precisely because a high level of 
mutual understanding has come about between Moscow and Yerevan. 
The Government of Armenia has no need of advocates, but, knowing 
the true state of affairs, I am duty bound to emphasize that the 
president of the republic and the parliament and the Cabinet of 
Ministers are doing everything possible for the continued 
development and intensification of bilateral interstate 
relations. And people like the GOLOS authors, although swearing 
their love for Russia, are in practice doing everything to 
hinder this work, since for them the worse things are, the 
better. They are, alas, giving no serious thought to the needs 
of their people and their true interests. 
  [Khanbabyan] The licentiousness, in the full sense of the 
word, that GOLOS ARMENII has been demonstrating constantly as of 
late in its evaluation of phenomena and individuals would seem 
to me personally to be a consequence, frankly speaking, of a not 
entirely comprehensible timorousness on the part of the law.... 
  [Stupishin] Democracy should be defended, of course. This is 
axiomatic. Otherwise, it degenerates into license, chaos, and 
anarchy, that is, things that are the direct opposite of 
freedom. But the whole point is that both with us, in Russia, 
and with you, in Armenia, democracy is still very young, still 
in diapers. And we are all only just learning democracy as yet. 
Learning how to defend it included. It is our inexperience of 
which publications like GOLOS ARMENII are taking advantage. They 
frequently abuse each and everything without proof and falsely, 
but with impunity here, and do they forget, in addition, to 
shout about the lack of "true freedom." It is easy to appear 
intrepid and high-minded if you know full well that there is no 
threat to you from this. A convenient position, there is no 
denying. Convenient, but, essentially, harmful and 
unconstructive. And simply unscrupulous also. 
  I would say this: God is their judge. And as far as the 
"timorousness of the law" is concerned, I repeat: It is not the 
business of an ambassador to interfere in intrastate matters. 
You yourselves and you alone must decide to what extent this 
publication or the other of GOLOS and its ilk are in keeping 
with the requirements of the press act and other laws of the 
Republic of Armenia.

  [Text] Ashgabat 14 June TASS -- "We cannot conceive a 
future for our selves without close cooperation with the Russian 
Federation, without mutual fraternal support in all aspects of 
policy and economy. Friendship with Russia is for us the basic 
foreign political factor, proceeding from which we determine our 
positions in international relations," President Saparmurat 
Niyazov said in a message of greetings to President Boris 
Yeltsin on Russia's Independence Day. 
  The message says that having embarked on a path of 
deep-going 
reforms the renewed democratic Russia has made it clear to the 
world that it is a great power which will not succumb to 
temporary difficulties. "I am confident that the time is not 
far away when Russia shows the world its own "economic miracle" 
and regain its might and glory," President Niyazov said. 
  The peoples of great Russia and Turkmenistan have been bound 
together by their common historical fate and deep 
inter-penetration of cultures, as well as by the common tasks 
facing them now. 
  "We know that Russia's well-being is a major component of 
our 
own independence which we value highly and of our own well-being 
both at present and in the future," Turkmenistan's president 
said. 
  Niyazov also sent a message of greetings to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin expressing satisfaction with the level of relations 
between the two countries, as well as gratitude for support 
which the Russian premier extends to Turkmenistan.

  [Text] Baku, June 13 (TURAN): "The leadership of the 
republic sees the results of the meetings and talks with Russian 
Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, as fruitful and useful", the 
State Advisor, Gabil Guseyinli, told TURAN. 
  The same source reports that on June 11 during the talks, 
the 
Azeri President and Russian Defense Minister discussed military 
cooperation within the framework of the Collective Security Pact. 
  Pavel Grachev spoke about the need for cooperation between 
military personnel of both countries and promised to contribute 
to the creation of the Azeri army. 
  Discussing the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Pavel Grachev 
said that he recognizes the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan 
and considers Nagorno-Karabakh a part of it. During the talks, 
the Grachev wished that Baku take into account the strategic and 
military intersts of Russia in the region. The Azeri President 
said that Russia's military leadership should use its 
opportunities and authority to reach a peaceful and diplomatic 
settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the 
liberation of all occupied- territories by the Armenians. 
Sources from the Presidential staff of Azerbaijan report that 
the introduction of the Russian peacemaking forces in the 
conflict region was not a major part of the discussion. 
However, Grachev and people close to him, repeatedly stated the 
necessity to introduce Russian peacemaking forces in the 
conflict region.

  [Text] Baku, June 13 (TURAN) -- "The Gabala Radio-Locator 
station remains under Russia's jurisdiction and it will be used 
within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Pact", said 
the head of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, Azad Alizade, to 
TURAN. 
  On June 11, Pavel Grachev and President Aliyev concluded a 
preliminary agreement on this matter. "A principal agreement 
will be worked out by specialists of both countries and after 
that a final document will be signed", said Alizade. The same 
source said that the staff of employees of that station will 
include Russian military personnel and a few Azeri soldiers. 
  Another source from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry told TURAN 
that Russia will use the radio-locator station free of charge 
and in exchange, Moscow has allegedly promised to "make other 
concessions to Azerbaijan in military affairs." 
  The Gabala radio-station was built in 1982-84 and it is the 
most powerful station in the south of the former USSR. It is 
used to observe the launching of ballistic missiles.

<F P=106> [Article by Bagif Efendiyev: "Sketches for a Portrait. Who </F>
Is He?"] 
  [Text] One might say that all of Azerbaijan has heard of 
Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev. He was a candidate for the post of 
president of the republic in 1993. He is chairman of the Veten 
Adzhagy Party (previously--Gummet). He is simply a billionaire. 
He is president of the Tarana firm. He is the author of the 
economic program for revival of Azerbaijan. This program has 
now been brought up for discussion in the National Assembly. 
But... 
  But it was written even prior to that, two years ago, during 
the summer in some beautiful little corner of Azerbaijan. In the 
apt words of Mr. Tagiyev, Azerbaijan is the center of the 
universe. This is why Russia, Turkey, Iran, England, and even 
the United States are hankering after the ancient and rich land 
of Azerbaijan. Not to mention the hostile Armenia. It is 
Armenia's misfortune that it began a battle for Azerbaijani 
land, as Germany did against Russia in its day. God has always 
been with us because our people live according to the divine 
laws of goodness, kindness, and amity. And any aggressor, 
especially the unhappy and pathetic Armenians, is living 
according to the laws of the devil, Iblis--the eternal enemy of 
God and Man.... 
  The war will not last forever. It will come to an end. And 
then it will be necessary not only heal the wounds but also to 
feed the people, build houses, and develop science, sports, and 
culture. Without an economic base there can be no culture--this 
is one of Mr. Tagiyev's aphorisms. The main task now is to carry 
out radical economic reforms. But there should be no radicalism 
in politics. Let there be leftists and rightists and centrists. 
But 90 percent of social life must consist of economics, 7 
percent--of politics, and only 3 percent--of foreign policy. 
That is what Zakir-bek thinks. And it is true! Look at what the 
independent states of the former, now collapsed, USSR are 
engaged in. Russia: Yeltsin's fight against the opposition. 
Ukraine: the president's fight for the Black Sea Fleet. 
Kazakhstan: the fight for Baykonur. Belarus: the fight to defeat 
Shushkevich. Moldova: Snegur and the Dniester region. Georgia: 
Shevardnadze overthrew Gamsakhurdia, but Ardzinba appeared in 
Abkhazia. Uzbekistan: Karimov is successfully suppressing the 
opposition. Kyrgyzstan: The fight for power is still going on. 
Turkmenistan: Turkmenbashi is reinforcing his personality cult. 
And then Azerbaijan and Armenia are fighting over Karabakh.... 
  Let us imagine for a second what would have happened if the 
money lost on political fighting or war had been used for 
economic development. There would have been an economic miracle 
in the CIS long ago. But no, everyone is infected with the 
bacilla of political fighting. They all want to become 
presidents, rulers, and masters, forgetting about the destinies 
of the peoples, about the standard of living of the simple 
people, who have ended up on the brink of poverty and are 
waiting for a political miracle!... 
  But there has never been such a thing in the history of 
mankind...and thank the Lord God and Almighty Allah that there 
are people who are thinking about economic revival! It is 
curious that Zakir-bek's program received a high rating from 
such luminaries of economic politics or political economics 
(however you wish) as Shatalin and Yavlinskiy, who are highly 
respected in the world. 
  The path to revival and entry into the market economy passes 
through capital. And the more people who are drawn into economic 
development, the richer the society will be and thus every 
person who makes up this society. And if Mr. Tagiyev two years 
ago asked the question in his work "What to do?", now he knows 
how to save us from the economic crisis that is getting worse 
with every leap of the dollar. The growth of prices has brought 
people to the point of spiritual degradation: They lie and 
deceive the new-fledged "businessmen," treat relatives like 
enemies, and brother turns against brother for a piece of land, 
for a small area of property, and the most audacious and bitter 
people assert that war is advantageous not only to Russia or 
Armenia... Tagiyev's program for entering the market has been 
approved by the Social Liberal Party of Russia and several 
business academicians in Kazakhstan. It makes up the economic 
parts of the programs of several parties in Azerbaijan, but for 
some reason we do not see it here in our republic. AZERTADZH was 
still even naive enough to refuse to print it, saying that there 
were too many parties and too many programs. Yes there are 
indeed too many programs. But not to see the advantages of Mr. 
Z.I. Tagiyev's economic program is ridiculous to say the least. 
Just one part of it, pertaining to the protection of mothers and 
children, makes it worthwhile. Have we read many concrete 
programs for social protection of children and women? 
  Whoever loves children loves God and whoever respects women 
respects the Most High! Incidentally, to the question of whether 
the esteemed Zakir believes in God and how his attitude toward 
the Most High is reflected in the program, he answers instantly: 
Allah will help us and bless us for serving the people...in 
principle this question might not even have been 
asked--journalistic curiosity got the better of me... It is 
sufficient to listen to a couple of minutes of Mr. Tagiyev's 
discussion with a refugee, a worker, an intellectual, a 
businessman, or an academician. Goodness and kindness simply 
radiate from him. He has a rare ability to understand and 
sympathize with the person with whom he is speaking; all the 
latter has to do is open his mouth! This is a true sign that he 
is constantly thinking about the future, about people first and 
then about himself! In order to understand this you yourself 
have to be without selfish egoism.... 
  The construction of that which will produce fruits in a year 
has been conceived now. I do not want to get ahead of events. We 
have adopted the practice of not noticing the success of another 
and scoffing if what they plan does not come to pass. But to 
imagine, for example, the existence of a sugar refinery in 
Azerbaijan is almost a fantasy. We are not Cuba or even Ukraine. 
But if Zakir-bek is certain that there will be such a plant, 
then there will be one! 
  It is impressive that Zakir Makhmudovich is gifted with 
respect to all components of human existence. One can only envy 
his patience. One can only be amazed by his ability to 
sympathize and understand people. His ability to penetrate to 
the essence of things without a lot of verbiage and tedium is in 
general apparently his main talent. And also his wisdom--not so 
much acquired as innate. He is clearly aware that if you lose 
two you will receive 20! If you make those around you happy, 
happiness will not abandon you. If you give confidence to 
another, success will not leave you. The Most High does indeed 
love Zakir-bek. And perhaps Allah loves those with whom Mr. 
Tagiyev himself communicates. In any case the phenomenon of 
Zakir Tagiyev has still to be understood and revealed. After 
all, many are not yet aware of the phenomenon of Zeynalabdin 
Tagiyev! And these symbols are not random: Z. and T., for many 
people are called by the name of the world-renowned patron Hajji 
Zeynalabdin Tagiyev. And many assume the name of the great 
patron themselves. But so far none are worthy. And, to be 
honest, I would not want to name Mr. Zakir Tagiyev or compare 
him to his initial namesake whom he resembles. In my opinion, he 
is a personality in and of himself and in time others will be 
compared to him and be said to resemble him, people who while 
increasing capital do not forget about God and, the main thing, 
about people or, vice versa: They do not forget about people 
and, the main thing, about God! 
  But still, why does my title contain the question: "Who Is 
He?" The reason is as simple as can be: Zakir-bek has a major 
secret about which the time has not yet come to speak. Perhaps 
he himself guesses about it intuitively. Not many people know 
about it. Whether or not I know is also a secret. But as a 
respectable journalist I promise to write about the secret. 
When? Only the Most High knows about that. And when He allows 
it, blesses it, then I will write it. Of course, with the 
permission of Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev himself.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin today left for a 
working visit to Blagoveshchensk in Amur Oblast. Before his 
departure, Boris Yeltsin gave an interview to journalists at the 
airport. In particular, he spoke about his telephone 
conversation with U.S. President Clinton a day before. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] We discussed several issues. 
First, the North Korean nuclear issue. And we agreed, or 
rather it was our proposal, to put forward to the Security 
Council a question about an international conference and, 
simultaneously, about sanctions -- phased-in ones. It is a very 
serious matter. So there you are. Later, Kozyrev and 
Christopher are to meet tomorrow or the day after in Brussels, 
where they are to agree the text. [end recording] 
  The presidents also discussed the question of Boris 
Yeltsin's 
visit to the United States in September this year. As for his 
visit to the Far East and Siberia, the Russian president noted 
the regions' specific features and abundance of mineral 
resources there. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] We have now somehow concentrated 
on 
the foreign countries in the east, and I think it is from there 
that an inflow of investment can be expected. This is something 
we are now lacking. I refer to China, Japan, and the Republic 
of Korea. [end recording]

rate," she said. "But the main thing in this problem is to take 
the measures, and not the speed with which this is done." 
  According to her the United States will proceed with the 
imposition of sanctions on Pyongyang for its refusal to allow 
International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors access to its 
nuclear facilities, even if China refuses to cooperate in this 
sphere. At the same time Albright expressed the hope, based on 
the experience of dealings with Chinese diplomats at the United 
Nations, that "Beijing realizes that the emergence of a nuclear 
North Korea is not in its interests." 
  "A week after Washington stated that it would seek the 
imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea, the 
administration of President Bill Clinton is still working 
intensively on a plan of such actions," THE NEW YORK TIMES 
writes.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent F. Tavrovskiy; from the </F>
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] Here is a sensational report we have received from 
the ITAR-TASS news agency today. This is what it says. The 
North Korean Foreign Ministry has stated that North Korea is to 
pull out of the International Atomic Energy Agency immediately 
and is set to pursue its independent nuclear program in the 
future. 
  [Tavrovskiy] The declaration made public by the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry says that the reason for adopting it was the 
recent decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency to 
stop technical aid to North Korea. Pyongyang confirmed that 
North Korea's membership of the Nonproliferation Treaty has been 
suspended. Moreover, North Korea is refusing to allow 
international observers to inspect its nuclear sites in the 
future. At the same time, the IAEA said that it had received no 
notification as yet from North Korea about its decision to 
resign from the agency. 
  Perhaps, after North Korea's step today, sanctions which the 
United States, Japan, and South Korea want will be inevitable. 
At the same time, Pyongyang says that if the sanctions are 
imposed, a terrible war will be waged on the Korean peninsula. 
  There is no doubt that the actions of the North Korean 
regime 
must be condemned. Nevertheless, I would like to say that South 
Africa and Israel may well have a nuclear bomb as well. It is 
quite possible that Libya and Pakistan also possess it. So when 
North Korea blames the IAEA of double-standards, its words carry 
a certain grain of truth. The best way out of the current 
situation may be the Russian proposal for an international 
conference for nuclear security in the Korean peninsula with all 
the interested parties taking part.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has just 
been on a four-day working visit to the Transcaucasus. The 
results of his tour are reviewed by correspondent Sergey 
Omelchenko: 
  [Omelchenko] A Russian military presence in the 
Transcaucasus, whether in the form of bases, peacekeeping forces 
or specialists, is not some whim of generals or politicians. It 
is absolutely indispensable to the maintenance of stability, 
security and peace in the region. This conclusion can be drawn 
from the results of the talks which Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev held during his four-day whistle-stop tour of the 
Caucasus. 
  Agreement was reached with Armenian President Levon Ter- 
Petrosyan, one of those in favor of having Russian military 
bases in the region, on the status of the base to be manned by a 
Russian motor rifle division at Gyumri, formerly Leninakan, and 
the stationing of a regiment in Yerevan. In Baku President 
Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan proposed that a separate agreement 
on military- technical cooperation should not be signed. 
Instead this should form part of a general treaty on friendship 
and cooperation between our states. During the talks in Baku it 
transpired that Azerbaijan was not opposed to the idea of joint 
Russo-Azerbaijani control over the early warning radar station 
at Gabala, one of the biggest in the south. However, this 
question will be finally decided after further work has been 
done by experts. Incidentally Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia 
unanimously called for participation in a common system of CIS 
air defense. 
  As far as a settlement of the Karabakh conflict is 
concerned, 
Azerbaijan did not in the end sign the protocol on a cease-fire 
and disengagement of forces, which Armenia and Russia signed on 
17 May. However, Aliyev assured the Russian defense minister 
that he would do his utmost to stop the hostilities. 
  From the results of the talks with the Georgian head of 
state 
and the Abkhaz leader one can draw the conclusion that the 
situation as regards a solution to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict 
is significantly better. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev 
said as much to me in an interview: 
  [Begin Grachev recording] Both the President of Georgia and 
the President of Abkhazia are giving their agreement to peace- 
keeping operations. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin will sign a 
decree. This decree will be ratified by the Federal Assembly on 
14 June, and we will be able to embark on the peacekeeping 
mission within three days -- five at the most -- after orders 
have been given for the operation to get underway. All our 
forces are ready. All we have left to do is to decide what 
combat equipment and how many men can be spared from the 345th 
Regiment. Then everything will be ready, I think. I consider 
that my mission here is over. I shall report to the president, 
and then we shall get down to work. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev opposed any unilateral steps in Bosnia and said 
the US intention to lift arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims 
can throw the world back to the times of the "Cold War". 
  "Russia will not resort to unilateral steps in its policy in 
the region which are not connected with the peaceful settlement 
and may destroy the basics of international peace and security. 
Such measures would be contrary to the Russian national 
interests, contrary to the basic interests of the people of 
Yugoslavia", he told Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on 
Tuesday. 
  Kozyrev urged other countries to refrain from unilateral 
actions and expressed hope that the US Administration will not 
support the intention of the Congress to unilaterally lift the 
arms embagro on Bosnian Muslims. 
  "Otherwise a violation of the (UN) Security Council 
resolutions, the UN Charter will be evident which would create a 
new political situation. If any of the powers begins to 
unilaterally support those `under its wardship', the world will 
return to the worst times of the `Cold War'", he said.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared 
today that ending international sanctions against the Bosnian 
Muslims might return the world to a state of cold war and even 
push it into a third world war. He expressed his view to 
journalists, according to a REUTER report, after a meeting in 
Moscow with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has 
arrived in the Russian capital to receive a literary prize. 
  As is known, the other day the U.S. Congress decided on a 
unilateral dropping of the embargo on arms supplies to the 
Muslim side in the Bosnian conflict. The head of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry noted that Russia, for its part, will not be 
taking similar steps vis-a-vis the Bosnian Serbs unless they are 
connected with a peaceful settlement of the crisis.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- "As a result of personal efforts 
by the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, there is a now a unique 
chance for you to make the correct choice," Andrey Kozyrev 
declared here today when opening talks with the leader of the 
Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic. According to the Russian 
Federation foreign minister, the first meeting about Bosnia 
between the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and 
five European Union countries, which was held in Geneva on 13 
May, "created a good foundation for peace." This foundation is, 
first and foremost, "full equality of rights for the peoples of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and full equality of choice for the Bosnian 
Serbs." In the near future "We intend to attempt to hold a 
second ministerial meeting which will provide an opportunity to 
reach a very important agreement on this basis, precisely within 
this framework." 
  By opting for peace, A. Kozyrev continued, the Bosnian Serbs 
will be able to count on Russia's most resolute support. Among 
other things, Russia believes that when the territorial issue is 
decided the Serb people of Bosnia-Herzegovina should hold 49 
percent of the territory. History has decreed that although the 
Serbs form only around 33 percent of the Bosnian population, 
they are entitled to claim a large and fair slice of territory. 
When peace is restored, sanctions will be lifted, Yugoslavia 
will rejoin the "family of nations," and assistance will be 
given with the rehabilitation of the war-damaged economy. 
  In order to avoid misunderstandings, the Russian minister 
went on to say, I would also like to issue a clear warning. 
There is another option, leading to war -- unwillingness to 
accept reasonable compromises and an intention to hold on to 70 
percent of the territory which is now being held by the Bosnian 
Serb as a result of the war. If you do opt for war -- and we 
believe that this will not happen -- we must state just as 
firmly that you will not, in that case, be able to count on 
Russia. "As real friends, we only support fair play," A. Kozyrev 
stressed. "Russia will not support injustice."

  [Text] Moscow, June 14 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev called on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic Tuesday 
to accept the proposed partitioning of Bosnia-Hercegovina which 
he said would lead to economic aid from Russia and the end of 
sanctions. 
  "If you choose war, you will not be able to count on us for 
support," Kozyrev warned Karadzic who arrived here Monday to 
receive a literary award from the conservative Writers' Union. 
  The foreign minister said he supported granting Bosnian 
Serbs 
49.1 percent of the territory in line with the proposed peace 
plan but that 70 percent was "much too much". 
  He told Karadzic that if Bosnian Serbs accept the plan, "you 
can count on Russia's firm support," adding that it would lead 
to the lifting of sanctions against former Yugoslavia and fresh 
economic aid. 
  Karadzic stated that Bosnian Serbs were "tired" of the 
four-year conflict and that they wanted peace. 
  He thanked the Russian leadership for its support, adding: 
"We know that Russia is our friend." 
  Kozyrev reiterated his call for a second ministerial meeting 
to pursue the efforts launched at the first conference held in 
Geneva in May. 
  "This conference lead to the recognition of equal rights for 
all peoples of Bosnia," Kozyrev said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 13 (TANJUG) -- President of the Bosnian 
Serb republic Radovan Karadzic has warned that the war in Bosnia 
might continue if totally unacceptable maps are offered. 
  Karadzic is in Moscow to receive the Mikhail Sholokov prize 
for literature which has been awarded to him by the Association 
of Russian Writers. 
  In a statement to reporters at Moscow airport upon his 
arrival on Monday, Karadzic said that no-one can expect Bosnian 
Serbs to accept something in whose creation they did not take 
part, including maps which do not take into consideration the 
actual situation in the field, without respect for the 
historical factors and especially the vital interests of the 
Serb people. 
  Under the plan of the contact group which consists of 
representatives of the United States, Russia, and the European 
Union, the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina will be divided into two parts, 51 percent for the 
Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Serb republic. 
  Some U.S. circles are behind the beginning of the Bosnian 
war 
and its prolonging, Karadzic said, emphasizing that he was not 
blaming the entire U.S. administration for this. 
  Pointing out that the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina was created without the participation of Bosnian 
Serbs, Karadzic underscored that the federation was created only 
by respecting the military factor, in the sense of forming an 
anti-Serb coalition. 
  Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croatia 
signed a preliminary agreement in Washington on March 1, under 
strong pressure from the U.S., on the forming of a federation of 
the two peoples in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which 
would later enter into a confederation with Croatia. 
  Political analysts believe that Washington is again trying 
to 
isolate Bosnian Serbs with this initiative and pressure them 
into making territorial concessions more easily at the 
conference table. 
  Despite the embargo, Moslems and Croats in Bosnia are arming 
themselves, so that the decision adopted by the House of 
Representatives of U.S. Congress last week to exempt Moslems 
from the embargo on arms sales to former Yugoslavia actually has 
no major significance. 
  I would like such a decision to be adopted, because in that 
case I expect Russia would lift the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, Karadzic said. 
  The United Nations Security Council imposed an embargo on 
arms sales to all republics of the former Yugoslav federation in 
the autumn of 1991, and two years ago, also comprehensive and 
tough sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
unjustly accusing it of having the greatest responsibility for 
the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Karadzic concluded that Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
not 
interested in the establishment of peace, but urge the war 
option, because they have the support of the United States. 
  The Bosnian Serb president said that he expected he would 
meet with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other ministry 
officials. He expressed hope that he would meet also with Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Russian Federation President 
Boris Yeltsin.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Leader of the Bosnian Serbs 
Radovan Karadzic in turn has highly approved the Russian foreign 
policy especially during the Sarajevo ultimatum. 
  Today Karadzic arrived in Moscow to receive the Sholokhov 
literature prize. During his visit Karadzic intends to meet 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev also but in the words of the 
leader of the Bosnian Serbs himself he will not raise the 
question of Russia recognizing the Serbian Republic. 
  At the same time Karadzic voiced the wish that Russian 
diplomats in the Balkans should be more understanding towards 
the problems of the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic also called for 
expansion of the Russian peacemaking contingent in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  [Begin Karadzic recording -- in Russian] We think this would 
be a necessary expansion because they would be more objective 
than soldiers from Muslim sides [storony]. We did not resist 
when soldiers from Muslim sides came but we think there could be 
big problems if the UN decides to leave and then soldiers from 
the Muslim sides might stay and then the balance would be upset. 
[end recording] 
  Commenting on the decision of the U.S. Congress to lift the 
embargo on arms supplies to Bosnia, Karadzic said in his 
interview to Radio Moscow Echo: [Begin Karadzic recording] It 
has to be said that there is no embargo because the Muslims are 
getting arms every day and sometimes I think it might be in our 
interests if the Americans lifted the embargo and sanctions on 
the Muslims and then Russia and the Ukraine and other states 
around Serbia which have difficulties with the sanctions might 
lift the sanctions against Serbia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today it was announced that the congress of Russian 
writers opens tomorrow in Moscow and one of the events of the 
first day of work at the congress will be the ceremony to give 
an award to the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic. 
Karadzic has just arrived in Moscow. Here is a report from 
Vyacheslav Grunskiy. 
  [Grunskiy] The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic, who 
planned to come to Moscow on 8 June was able to get to the 
Russian capital only this evening. The main reason for the 
delay was that this time Karadzic came to Moscow by private 
invitation, and therefore under the conditions of the 
international embargo currently in effect against Yugoslavia, it 
took a long time to reach an agreement with the UN 
sanctions-monitoring committee on a flight from Belgrade. 
  The Russian Union of Writers intended to award Karadzic a 
prize for his poems written, it is true, a long time before the 
start of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But nevertheless 
it is impossible to say that Karadzic's visit to Moscow is 
purely private. His delegation contains three ministers from the 
Bosnian Serb government. Karadzic himself intends during his 
visit to Moscow to meet several Russian leaders. 
  [Begin recording] [Grunskiy] Mr. Karadzic, Russian 
Independent Television. What questions do you intend to resolve 
during your visit to Moscow, and who are you going to meet? 
  [Karadzic in Russian] I hope to meet minister Kozyrev or 
maybe Churkin or meet someone from that ministry, the Foreign

that he is not in Russia at present. And also if it was 
possible to meet the president that would be a great joy for the

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Prokopyev of the Russian Federation </F>
Border Troops Press Bureau: "`Traffic Lights' Installed Near 
Khabarovsk. Temporary Navigation Procedure Introduced in Far 
East Border Rivers for Chinese Vessels and Ships"] 
  [Text] Since navigation began in the border sectors of the 
Amur and Ussuri Rivers Chinese ships, including warships, have 
made repeated attempts to travel along Russia's internal waters 
near the city of Khabarovsk. All this was attributed to the 
practice that has evolved in recent years. 
  The point is that Article 8 of the Agreement Between the 
USSR 
and the PRC on the State Border of 16 May 1991 stated that 
"various types of ships, including warships, can sail unhindered 
from the Ussuri River to the Amur River past the city of 
Khabarovsk and back. Navigation rules will be drawn up by the 
sides' competent departments." But until recently all talks on 
this question were unsuccessful. 
  Being perfectly well aware that it is not advantageous to 
Russia to have foreign ships sailing in its waters, Khabarovsk 
administration decided do something itself to try to speed up 
the inordinately protracted process of the Russian-Chinese talks. 
  As a result our border guards have started to prevent the 
illegal passage of Chinese ships past Khabarovsk. At the 
diplomatic level our eastern neighbor was informed that Russia, 
while observing its adherence to the spirit and letter of the 
agreement of 16 May 1991, is establishing a temporary procedure 
until work on specific navigation regulations has been completed 
and hopes that these measures will be met with understanding 
from the Chinese side. The appropriate directive on monitoring 
the temporary navigation procedure has been issued to Khabarovsk 
Kray Administration, the Amur River Shipping Company, and the 
Far East Military District. 
  The third round of Russian-Chinese talks on drawing up 
navigation rules will take place 13 June in Beijing. One would 
like to hope that it will bring progress in solving the existing 
problem.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Afonin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moscow, 13 Jun -- A treaty on the foundations 
for friendly relations between the Russian Federation and the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam--that will strengthen the legal 
basis of all- round cooperation between the two states--will be 
signed during an official visit to Moscow by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet [15-17 June]. Viktor Ivanov, deputy 
director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, reported this to the ITAR-TASS correspondent today. 
Other documents are expected to be signed, including agreements 
on trade and economic cooperation in the agro-industrial 
complex, and an agreement on cooperation in the fishing 
industry. Ten intergovernmental agreements between Russia and 
Vietnam have already been signed. 
  The diplomat noted that the visit was important because a 
Vietnamese prime minister will meet Russian leaders for the 
first time since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. 
[passage omitted] 
  He said, however, that there were a number of complex and 
delicate issues in Russo-Vietnamese relations. These include 
the problem of Vietnamese debts to the former Soviet Union, 
which amount to around 10 trillion rubles (previous years 
prices). [passage omitted] 
  The other matter is the Vietnamese community in Russia that 
numbers several tens of thousands of people. The diplomat noted 
that several of them--like representatives of other foreign 
countries--commit various types of offenses in their commercial 
activity. Joint, civilized, methods are needed to resolve this 
matter, based on legislation. 
  Moscow welcomes the "open doors" policy conducted by the 
Vietnamese leaders, and it is no coincidence that priority at 
the upcoming talks is being given to trade and economic issues. 
  The Russian diplomat noted that the stances taken by Russia 
and Vietnam coincide on the overwhelming majority of issues. It 
is expected that the parties will devote most attention this 
time to cooperation in the Asiatic-Pacific Ocean region, taking 
into account the increasing role Vietnam is playing in southeast 
Asia. Russia understands the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's 
desire to join ASEAN --with which Russia is also entering into 
more active political dialogue.

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS--"Strange as it may seem, 
collective security problems assumed greater importance after 
the ending of the Cold War", said Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of 
the Defence Committee in the State Duma. He inaugurated on 
Tuesday a round-table conference on "Topical Problems of 
Collective Security in Europe". 
  "We all wish to make Europe more secure and stamp out 
military conflicts that flared up in the territory of the former 
USSR", he said. 
  Participants in the "round-table conference", among them 
British MPs, noted that certain caution had become apparent in 
relations between Russia and NATO of late. Russia and the West 
have not agreed on any legal principles of the stay of Russian 
troops in CIS countries, Russian expert Aleksandr Nikitin 
pointed out. He believes a draft concept of collective security 
of the CIS countries should be discussed by a meeting of the 
State Duma. This concept should also be discussed with NATO 
representatives so they could rightly understand the concept. 
  Member of the British parliament Bruce George said the 
Partnership for Peace programme is just an initial step in the 
establishment of closer relations between Russia and NATO. This 
is also an attempt to prevent rapid integration of East European 
countries in NATO to which Russia may react negatively. 
Russia's joining in the Partnership for Peace programme will 
lead to greater mutual knowledge and confidence. The 
integration process can then be embarked upon, Bruce George said.

<F P=106> [Manki Ponomarev report: "NATO Council Session Ended"] </F>
  [Text] The latest NATO Council session, held in Istanbul, 
has concluded its work. The session participants -- foreign 
ministers of the countries of the alliance -- focused attention 
on relations with Russia. 
  The lively debate resulted in agreement that closer ties 
must 
be established with the Russian Federation. The session 
participants confirmed the expediency of Moscow's joining the 
partnership program. At the same time they acknowledged 
readiness to hold special consultations with the Russian 
leadership outside the framework of this program, if necessary, 
on questions such as the Bosnian crisis, the actions of 
peacemaking forces in Europe, and nuclear arms control. 
  The NATO countries' ministers unanimously rejected the 
possibility of granting Russia the right to veto decisions of 
the North Atlantic Alliance. As is known, however, Russia does 
not aspire to such a right. But nor does it want to be 
presented with "surprises" in the future, as was the case 
recently with the Atlanticists' unilateral ultimatum in Bosnia. 
  Other questions were also discussed at the Istanbul session 
in addition to the problems of relations with Russia. Its 
participants reinforced with their authority the recent attempt 
to impose a solution of the territorial problem on the opposing 
sides in Bosnia and once again stated their readiness to send a 
peacekeeping force to Bosnia as soon as the opposing sides sign 
a final agreement.

correspondents' column: "Let Us Trade"] 
  [Text] Delhi -- Indian-Russian trade, which in recent 
times has suffered a slump, is showing signs of revival, and 
this year, according to the estimates of experts of the 
Federation of Indian Export Organizations, could increase by 
50-100 percent. Taking into account existing accords, the 
forecast notes, Russian exports to India in 1994 will reach $800 
million, with a reciprocal flow of commodities and services of 
$1.1. billion. 
  The official visit to Moscow of Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao, 
planned for the end of June, will be an important boost to trade 
and economic relations between the two countries, the Indian 
Ministry of Trade's Planning Commission suggests. 
  The expansion of trade links is to a great extent being 
achieved through the establishment of direct cooperation between 
Indian entrepreneurs and individual cities and regions of the 
Russian Federation. A delegation of businessmen from Maritime 
Kray headed by Deputy Governor G. Tokulenko, chairman of the 
Committee for State Property and Privatization, held 
negotiations in Delhi the other day. In his words, the kray's 
businessmen are interested in expanding trade with India and 
creating joint enterprises in such important sectors for them as 
construction, agriculture, the food industry, fishing, and 
several others. In the near future they already expect to 
satisfy the heavy consumer demand for, in particular, fresh 
fruit, vegetables, and medicines with the aid of their Indian 
partners.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Trushin article: </F>
"Argentina Wants To Buy Large Consignments of Russian Weapons 
But Cannot Yet Do So Owing to Material Difficulties"] 
  [Excerpts] Brigadier General Luis Tracabal Lobo did not 
hide the fact that he represents General Augusto Pinochet, 
commander in chief of Chile's ground forces. Tracabal Lobo 
meticulously questioned Aleksandr Khinikadze, director of the 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Precision Machine 
Building of the Russian State Committee for the Defense Sectors 
of Industry, about the merits of small arms. He was 
particularly interested in one of the best developments -- the 
9mm Gyurza pistol with a powerful round which penetrates 
bulletproof vests. The Chilean general joked that such a 
pistol, if acquired by Chile's carabineros or other special 
services, would "undermine" his own product -- Tracabal Lobo is 
head of a factory which produces bulletproof vests in particular. 
  Chileans, Argentines, Peruvians, and representatives of 
other 
Latin American countries are showing interest in our combat 
hardware and weapons. But, at the same time, they are in no 
hurry to conclude contracts to acquire them. This is largely 
accounted for by the specific nature of the Latin American arms 
market. 
  On the whole, Russia is well acquainted with this region. In 
the past the former USSR had large contracts to deliver weapons 
to Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela. Therefore it would be 
perfectly logical to expand this market by including other South 
American countries, primarily Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, 
which possess large armed forces. In this Russian 
representatives place special emphasis on Argentina, mindful of 
the fact that during the Malvinas [Falklands] war of 1982 it 
lost a considerable proportion of its combat hardware and 
weapons. In addition, throughout the past decade there has been 
a U.S. and British embargo on arms deliveries to that country. 
  A recent circumstance arouses extreme displeasure in 
Argentine military circles. Oscar Camilion, minister of 
national defense, has repeatedly told local journalists that he 
does not understand Washington's attitude to Argentina. "When 
its participation in UN peacemaking actions is needed, we enjoy 
the Americans' full trust. But if it is a question of arms 
deliveries, this trust is missing." 
  In putting pressure on Argentina in this sphere the United 
States pursues not so much geopolitical ends as economic ones. 
Washington is afraid that Argentina and other South American 
countries will start winning the Near East market above all with 
their developments, including in the nuclear sphere, and so will 
weaken the U.S. positions there. At the same time Washington 
carefully sees to it that nobody can encroach upon the nearby, 
Latin American market. 
  Nevertheless, certain military circles in Argentina are 
showing interest in purchasing arms and hardware from Russia. 
Here, however, the U.S. factor once again comes into play: The 
Argentines would like to join NATO in the future. The Americans 
say that this possibility has now increased significantly. 
True, for this Argentina's Armed Forces must have Western arms 
which meet NATO standards. "If you want to buy hardware and 
arms from Russia, this means that your initiative with regard to 
joining NATO will not be realized," the United States declares. 
  And yet the financial and economic situation in the South 
American country is one of the principal factors curbing 
Russia's penetration of Argentina's military market. [passage 
omitted] 
  So major deals along military lines are hardly possible 
between Russia and Argentina in the immediate future. Nor are 
there any prospects for joint arms production at present. This 
line in Russian exports requires careful preparation and a 
cautious and gradual approach. At the same time it is perfectly 
realistic to conclude small contracts right now with due regard 
for the fact that the Argentines are well informed about our 
successes in military technology and show definite interest in 
acquiring inexpensive models.

  [Text] Sofia June 13 TASS -- "Russia and Bulgaria are now 
free sovereign states and one would not like any encroachments 
upon their freedom and sovereignty. Interparliamentary 
exchanges promote precisely the establishment of closer 
political relations between the two countries," Russian 
Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists 
here on Monday, informing them of some aspects of talks with 
Alexander Iordanov, chairman of the People's Assembly. The 
development of economic cooperation was one of the main subjects 
during the exchange of views, Shumeyko said. 
  Much attention during the dialogue was devoted to 
legislative 
support for the development of economic cooperation, Yuriy 
Algunov, press secretary of the Federation Council speaker, told 
ITAR-TASS. The Bulgarian side showed great interest in the 
experience which is being gained within the framework of the 
interparliamentary assembly of CIS countries, Algunov said. 
  This was also confirmed by the Bulgarian parliament chief 
who 
at the same time expressed an opinion that the time apparently 
comes to change over "from official visits to the level of 
working contacts between individual commissions of the two 
parliaments." 
  Participants in the meeting positively assessed the 
establishment of permanent exchanges of information on the 
activities of Russia's Federal Assembly and Bulgaria's People's 
Assembly. 
  The fact that Shumeyko invited Iordanov to visit Moscow at a 
date of his convenience is an earnest of future constructive 
contacts between them. A similar invitation to Iordanov was 
also extended earlier by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin who 
visited here at the beginning of the year. 
  At the close of the meeting in the Bulgarian parliament, the 
Russian delegation was received by Professor Lyuben Berov, 
chairman of the Council of Ministers. On the same day, the 
guests laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's tomb -- a memorial 
complex in downtown Sofia in commemoration of Bulgarians who had 
perished on the battlefields.

wide range of issues regarding bilateral relations and topical 
international problems. Russian-Bulgarian relations should be 
developed harmoniously and to mutual benefit, the leader of the

noted that during the meetings held in the Bulgarian capital, 
some matters arose on which the sides need to clarify each 
others positions, in particular, the NATO program Partnership 
for Peace. But, according to Shumeyko, disputes are of an 
economic rather than political nature. 
  During the conversation Vladimir Shumeyko conveyed to the

Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is to visit Bulgaria 
in autumn. 
  Shumeyko said that during the forthcoming visit the Russian 
premier is expected to sign a package of documents that are of 
importance for the development of cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  This subject was also the focus of a meeting here on Monday 
between the Russian parliamentarians and Professor Lyuben Berov, 
chairman of Bulgaria's Council of Ministers. Special attention 
was devoted to matters connected with settling the two 
countries' mutual debts. 
  The two sides believe that it is now essential to approach 
this problem "in an unprejudiced way and find a mutually 
acceptable compromise", Shumeyko said. 
  Military-technical cooperation, including that between 
defence industry enterprises, was discussed as well. The two 
sides agreed that one should now renounce primitive forms of 
perestroyka-period cooperation, barter in particular, and move 
on to civilised forms acceptable throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Litvinova: "Fate of Latvian `Noncitizens' </F>
Explained. But It Seems This Will Not Make Their Lives Any 
Easier"] 
  [Text] Fifty Latvian Saeima deputies have decided the fate 
of the hundreds of thousands of residents who are uncertain of 
their future. The law on citizenship has passed its second 
reading. 
  This means that conceptual changes are no longer possible, 
and at the third reading (expected to be held at an emergency 
session during the summer parliamentary recess) only editorial 
amendments that do not alter the essence of the law will be 
possible. 
  This long-awaited law -- Latvia is the only republic in the 
former Union where such a document has not been adopted -- has 
undergone significant changes since its first reading in the 
fall. Proposals have mainly been submitted by the 
national-radical faction of the the Latvian National 
Independence Movement [LNNK] (as is well known, the LNNK was 
victorious in the recent municipal elections). The new articles 
are notable for their ethnic protectionism -- for instance, the 
"priority" group of those who can apply for naturalization 
before 1 January 1996 includes not only ethnic Latvians and 
Livonians, but also Estonians and Lithuanians. Attempts to 
ascertain in what way they are better than Belarusians or Poles 
have proved fruitless -- politicians have provided no sensible 
explanations, citing "Baltic unity." 
  The first people who can claim Latvian citizenship are the 
spouses of citizens (if married for more than 10 years). 
  The list of those who cannot become Latvian citizens under 
any circumstances is very long -- these include criminal 
elements, people spreading fascist or communist ideas (in the 
period since 4 May 1990, when Latvian idependence was 
proclaimed), KGB and other special service staffers, and 
demobilized Soviet Army personnel who have remained to reside 
permanently in the republic. I would note that the demands on 
"noncitizens" are far stricter than those on "citizens": The 
latter can have been in the security services or served in the 
Soviet Army, or leaders of the criminal fraternity -- it will 
not affect their citizenship. 
  Those given "priority" will not receive automatic 
citizenship. They also have to meet a residence qualification. 
They will have to take a test of their knowledge of the Latvian 
Constitution, the republic's history, and the Latvian language. 
They must have a legal source of income. 
  It would be nice to think that all the tests and checks 
would 
be objective and impartial, but the current arbitrary civil 
service practice at local level raises doubts -- the 
arbitrariness of departments and clerks have been recognized by 
international experts working in Latvia. 
  As of 1 January 1996 it will be time for those born in 
Latvia 
to apply to be naturalized. Age lists will be drawn up and, 
deputies believe, by the year 2000 anyone "over 30" should have 
submitted an application. After this date everyone else can 
apply for citizenship, but...not more than 0.1 percent of the 
total number of citizens may apply each year. Recent statistics 
show that Latvians currently make up 54.2 percent of the 
republic's total population. But the initiators of the hard line 
in the citizenship law -- such as Deputy Aristids Lambergs, for 
instance -- believe that this figure should go beyond the 
70-percent mark. 
  Latvia is making no secret of the fact that it would like 
the 
fall Council of Europe session to consider the Baltic state's 
admission to this international organization. The citizenship 
law and the criticism of it by Max van der Stoel, CSCE 
commissioner for ethnic minority affairs, have held up this 
process. The assessment that the new document receives from 
experts and European politicians is something awaited by both 
the Latvian authorities and by Latvian "noncitizens" who are 
dissatisfied with it.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Vitaliy Pidchenko; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] A meeting took place in Kharkov today that was 
attended by representatives of the leading space firms in Russia 
and Ukraine. 
  [Pidchenko] The participants in this meeting have been 
partners for quite some time. For more than 30 years they have 
worked in close contact, creating the country's strategic 
missile shield. Now, there is a state frontier between them, the 
enterprises, design bureaux, and institutes of the former 
Glavkosmos [USSR Main Administration for the Development and Use 
of Space Technology for the National Economy and Scientific 
Research]. Representatives of them arrived in Kharkov to 
discuss the future joint program. In particular, it is proposed 
that CIS nuclear power stations, as well as a number of main oil 
and gas pipelines, should be fitted with super-reliable systems 
of electronic control. 
  Within the framework of another program ordered by the 
Russian Central Bank, it is planned to create a global system of 
communications, putting three earth satellites into orbit. This 
will allow Russia and Ukraine, to begin with, and then other 
countries, to carry out interbank operations almost 
instantaneously.

  [Text] The Ostankino television company has reduced 
broadcasting to Armenia to just a few hours in the evenings. 
ITAR- TASS reports that this has been caused by demands for 
additional payments for daytime broadcasts. Tigran Akopyan, 
chairman of Armenia's State Television and Radio, explained that 
the restrictions will be in force until Yerevan pays Moscow for 
the additional expenses of communications enterprises. The 
technical service of Armenian television estimates the cost of 
the services at 600 million Russian rubles.

<F P=106> [Reports by B. Filippov and own correspondent Arif Useynov </F>
under general headline: "To Whom Does Caspian Shelf Belong? 
Geydar Aliyev Does Not Agree With Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry Note"] 
  [Text] As already reported in the pages of our newspaper, 
following the USSR's disintegration Azerbaijan, having become a 
sovereign state, proclaimed the Caspian Sea oil shelf off the 
republic's shores to be its own property and on this basis 
announced an international competition to sell oil deposits. 
  This competition was won by British companies, although it 
was promised that between 10 and 20 percent of this deal would 
be given to the Russian company "LUKoil." 
  But last week the Russian Foreign Ministry sent the British 
ambassador in Moscow a note describing as premature the 
conclusion of an Anglo-Azerbaijani memorandum on cooperation to 
survey and extract oil and gas in the Caspian Sea's so-called 
"Azerbaijani sector," because in the opinion of Smolensk Square 
[Foreign Ministry's location] there is no such thing as sectoral 
demarcation of the seabed in the Caspian and for that reason 
questions concerning the practical utilization of this closed 
basin's natural resources must be resolved jointly by all 
Caspian states -- Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, and 
Turkmenia [Turkmenistan]. 
  This note provoked a sharply negative reaction in the 
British 
Isles and Baku. British newspapers and the BBC immediately 
started talking about Russia's "imperial intentions." Official 
Baku also responded vigorously to the Russian Federation Foreign 
Ministry note. Our own correspondent reports on this. 
[Filippov ends] 
  [Useynov report] Baku -- In a conversation with British 
Ambassador to Baku Thomas Young Heydar Aliyev stated that the 
note's appearance should be regarded as a minor, insignificant 
event. "If any state wishes to hold talks about oil extraction 
in the Caspian by Azerbaijan," he said, "then let it approach 
Azerbaijan. If this is the Russian Government's intention, why 
address the note to the British Embassy and not Azerbaijan? 
What has Britain got to do with it?" 
  The head of state noted that it was with Azerbaijan's 
agreement that the Russian company "LUKoil" had been included in 
the consortium of oil-extracting firms headed by British 
Petroleum. 
  He reported that he had discussed this subject with Russian 
Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin by telephone 31 
May. According to him, the Russian premier knows nothing about 
the Foreign Ministry message and expressed considerable surprise 
concerning this. Chernomyrdin noted that he is not raising the 
question of the Caspian's status and has no intention of doing 
so, and he requested that this be officially conveyed on his 
behalf to the participants in the Istanbul talks. 
  Observers believe that the oil question has touched on 
another, no less important, problem. On what basis do the 
Caspian states intend to carry out joint utilization of the 
sea's resources -- not only oil resources, of course? After 
all, the question of the need to elaborate the Caspian's 
international status has been raised at international ecological 
conferences, meetings of Caspian states' representatives on 
problems of fishing, navigation, and protecting and increasing 
bioresources, and in all discussions and talks. Without this it 
is extremely difficult to make the optimal decisions and 
guarantee the unique water basin's ecological well-being.

  [Excerpts] A declaration on the creation of the Russia's 
Democratic Choice Party has been adopted at a founding congress 
being held in Moscow on the initiative of the Russia's Choice 
faction in the State Duma. Yegor Gaydar, speaking at the 
opening of the congress, said that the party's fundamental task 
was to create the prerequisites for stable economic development. 
In his words, present economic policy could place Russia in the 
position of a country under colonial rule within five years. 
  At the same time, Gaydar stressed that the new party will 
not 
join the opposition to the government, although it does not 
support it completely. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] Our position toward the government 
was formulated a long time ago. We support a coalition 
government: The government is fragmentary. We support 
individual areas of the government's work, including those in 
which members of our faction are working, some of whom are 
involved in the creation of our party. Privatization policy is 
just one obvious example. But we are not prepared to take 
responsibility for the essence and content of official economic 
policy. On the whole we do not support it. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] As for relations with other parties, answering a 
question from Ekho Moskvy, Yegor Gaydar said the following: 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] Of course our party's allies, in 
the 
Duma at least, are the 12 December faction and, on the whole, 
the Yabloko faction. Neither of these parties yet has its own 
developed political structure, but nevertheless, we regard them 
as our allies. 
  As for the Democratic Party of Russia and the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, these are not our allies. They are 
parties defending essentially different plans for Russia's 
future. In the Democratic Party there is undoubtedly a very 
strong element of playing on great-power sentiments. There are 
many points on which we disagree with the Party of Russia and 
Accord. But of course we are ready for dialogue with them.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Batygin article under the "Parties, Movements" </F>
rubric: "Big Business Banks on `Russia's Choice'"] 
  [Text] The denunciatory energy that has been pumped into 
Russian society over the past few years has, if not run out, 
then at any rate declined appreciably in the country's political 
life. The phase of democratic reform based on a mass social 
sense of discontent is behind us. Russia's present 
fundamentally different state makes it necessary to master a new 
language -- the language of dialogue, accord, democratic values 
-- and move away from frenzied screams of opposition to playing 
political solitaire. 
  Members of the new liberal-conservative party, "Russia's 
Choice," prefer to speak that language -- the language of market 
ideology -- in a country where, as DEUTSCHE WELLE remarked 
caustically, "everything can change overnight." The new party's 
constituent congress will be held in Moscow next Sunday. The 
program and "Russia's Choice" rules are ready and the party's 
definitive name will be decided by 800 congress delegates from 
64 Federation components where regional conferences have been 
held. 
  It was underlined at a press conference given by the future 
party's organizing committee that "Russia's Choice" is to 
"mobilize all democratic forces in order to decide on a 
presidential candidate for the coming elections." Thus members 
of "Russia's Choice" have very serious intentions. The election 
of the party's chairman is a mere formality, that post will be 
taken by Yegor Gaydar, the "architect" of the new economic 
policy. And delegates are to form a political council to 
represent all the regional organizations and implement the 
"Russia's Choice" policy between congresses, which are to 
convene at least once a year. They will have to decide who will 
hold the office of chairman of the executive committee, which 
tackles economic activity. 
  Per se, the idea of creating a mass political party is 
nothing new in postperestroyka Russia. It has been thought of 
by "Democratic Russia," the Communists, and the Democratic Party 
of Russia. 
  Yegor Gaydar has a clear idea of his party's social base -- 
"new Russians," businessmen, the regional nomenklatura. While 
admitting that there is a great threat of conservatism and 
reaction in the regions, he is fighting to create effective 
parties in the localities, "not fragile entities as was the case 
during the fight against the ossified regime." In the opinion 
of the "Russia's Choice" leader, the huge corrupt state machine 
that must be reformed by like-minded party members is hampering 
the formation of true market relations in the country. 
  In one way or another the fate of the future party depends 
on 
its leader. An extreme radical, Yegor Timurovich has recovered 
fairly rapidly from the knockout sustained by his faction 12 
December. Society's attitude toward him is by no means 
unambiguous. At the height of "shock therapy" I heard the 
following opinion of Gaydar: He was said to only view people as 
material for experiments. Under the ex-premier's "romantic 
exterior" there lurks a tough realist and pragmatist, who 
undoubtedly craves revenge for the humiliation in December. The 
liberal-radical "niche" in the shape of a new party best enables 
him to restore the trust of those who sincerely believe in the 
success of reforms and intend to "forge" them in practice. 
  It is incomparably easier for the admittedly beaten but 
nonetheless recognized Gaydar to tackle party building than, 
say, Socialist Party Chairman Lyudmila Vartazarova, a brilliant 
intellectual, but someone who is less well known in the 
"echelons of power." Despite the fact that high office did not 
enable Yegor Timurovich to cure Russia's economic ills, it is 
now time for a second attempt with the Russian president's 
approval. A party is an excellent, powerful instrument in the 
fight for power. 
  "Russia's Choice" may be called the leaders' party. It is 
unlikely that in his new role as "general secretary" Gaydar, 
whose reforms Solzhenitsyn rudely called "brainless" in 
Vladivostok, will renounce his "architect's" ideas in politics 
as well as in the economy. This idea is prompted by an 
important point -- the future liberal party will depend on a 
quite definite social group, brought up in the Western manner, 
which shares its tactics and strategy. Big business calls the 
tune. Financial groups and banks backing "Russia's Choice" 
would presumably like more rapid compensation for their election 
campaign expenditure. The most favorable prospects here will 
emerge when "Russia's Choice" members get into government. 
  ....I was introduced, admittedly by letter, to a future 
rank-and-file member of the new party. Igor Stepanovich 
Mironov, a resident of Moscow Oblast, sent the editorial office 
a letter entitled "Why I am joining Gaydar's party." The reader 
gave the following explanation for his personal choice: "Russia 
is weary of gray individuals being in power." 
  Needless to say, one letter is no excuse for 
generalizations, 
but nonetheless.... What indeed is to be done with the "gray 
mass," and at the same time with the middle class, people 
far-removed from complex political battles and leadership posts 
who only dream of one thing: Order in the country and normal, 
dignified lives for themselves and their children. Is there a 
guarantee that the new party of the future, which is essentially 
engaged and elitist, will ultimately address the well-being of 
all Russian society and not just the prosperity of a small 
number of entrepreneurs?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy withdrew his lawsuit against the head of 
the "Democratic Russia's Choice" Party, Yegor Gaydar, who he 
accused of comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The 
decision came after Gaydar had announced that he would 
personally appear in court to defend his statement that 
Zhirinovskiy resembles him the "Hitler of 1929". 
  Zhirinovskiy's lawyer Sergey Belyak told TASS that the 
lawsuit was withdrawn on June 7, but Gaydar, who came to the 
court on Tuesday, said he knew nothing about that and showed a 
summon, according to which he had to be present in court as a 
defendant. 
  Gaydar believes Zhirinovskiy should have appeared in court 
to 
explain his decision which, according to him, is "another 
evident proof that aggressive people are often very cautious". 
  However, Zhirinovskiy plans to file a new lawsuit against 
Gaydar and the "IZVESTIYA" newspaper which published his article 
in which Gaydar insists that Zhirinovskiy is a fascist and 
analyses his rhetorics. The lawsuit is to be filed on June 17, 
Belyak told TASS. He added that another lawsuit will be filed 
on June 27 against Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of the Russian 
TV, who claimed that Zhirinovskiy had paid members of his Duma 
faction 500 US dollars for voting in favour of the 1994 budget. 
  According to the lawyer, some 20 lawsuits against various 
media and politicians had been already filed by his client.

<H5>  Offensive of the "Behemoths" (Moscow Political Beau Monde Is </H5>
Gradually Ceding Levers of Power to Regional Leaders) 
  It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Moscow 
political 
beau monde is quietly retreating under pressure from regional 
chiefs as well as politicians who, being regional leaders not so 
long ago, have not only preserved kinship and political and 
economic ties with their small homeland but are also -- in the 
struggle for a place on the political Olympus -- continuing to 
rely on the regions, above all. 
  During "postperestroyka" the regional bosses have gained 
strength on two occasions already. First, immediately after 
August 1991 (the collapse of the CPSU) and the ensuing 
Belovezhskoye agreement (the disbandment of Union structures), 
when centrifugal sentiments increased and leaders of "Federation 
components" (at that time the term was not yet in use), like 
leaders of former Union republics, tried to take "as much powers 
as they could lay their hands on" -- although nobody got very 
far apart from Dudayev. 
  At that time the sovereignization of the regions was 
hindered 
by several circumstances. 
  First, the resistance of the new Russian authority, starting 
from the president's supporters (Skokov, for example, or 
Shakhray, who made considerable efforts to restrain the 
autonomous entities which were part of the Federation) and 
ending with deputies to the Supreme Soviet, where there were 
clearly more supporters of a united Russia than supporters of 
sovereignization or the creation of a Russian Republic within 
the Russian Federation. Second, the chronic conflict between 
the republics and the oblast leaders, who also stated their 
demands to federal authority, which hardly facilitated the 
sovereignization of future Federation components along national 
and ethnic lines. Third, neither -- unlike a number of leaders 
of former Union republics -- could rely on a wave of national 
movements in their plans for and attempts at 
self-determination...there was simply none of these in any 
Russian region except Tatarstan. 
  The second wave of strengthening the regions came in fall 
1993. It was then that the Russian president first realized -- 
in the struggle with the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet -- 
the need to intercept the regions and proposed the formation of 
the Federation Council, which was on the point of starting to 
form itself within the Constitutional Conference, and 
centrifugal sentiments already predominated in it, unlike in 
1991-1992 (by the end of 1992 most regional leaders realized 
that sovereignization had no economic foundation and that 
administratively too much, alas, revolves around the center), 
although the fact that the Federation Council did not support 
the president in October 1993 prompted October 1993 to happen 
and especially prompted the political and commercial forces 
behind it to disband the Federation Council simultaneously with 
the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. 
  Today we are observing the signs of the latest, third, wave 
of activization by regional leaders. This wave promises to be 
more fruitful (the "law of dialectics" -- development in a 
spiral and the repetition of development that has taken place at 
a higher level). First, it has a constitutional linchpin -- the 
Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly. 
Second, there is some experience (unsuccessful experience is 
experience nevertheless) of collaboration with federal authority. 
  The cause of May's activization of regional leaders was the 
State Duma's adoption of the federal budget for 1994, or to put 
it simply the distribution of state resources. While, for 
instance, representatives of the fuel and energy complex, which 
controls the government by drawing up the budget to suit itself, 
are more or less satisfied with it, the military-industrial 
complex was cut, the agrarian complex did not obtain what it 
wanted either, and during the budget's adoption other sectors 
simply were simply not noticed. The result was the snubbing of 
regional leaders, "senators," including leaders of enterprises 
which had been left with nothing. The effect was to turn the 
Federation Council toward the regions and the 
military-industrial complex; the appointment of N. Yegorov, head 
of Krasnodar administration, as minister of national and 
regional affairs; the rumors of Skokov's strengthened position, 
who is apparently still in good standing with some regionals and 
the defense sector; the meeting of leaders of interregional 
economic associations, etc. 
<H5>  What Can Be Predicted in This Situation? </H5>
  Above all -- the start of a new phase of struggle in the 
upper echelons of power. But not between, for instance, the 
president and government or the president and parliament, but 
between sectoral clans on the one hand and regional lobbyists on 
the other, and also between sectoral groups themselves: THE 
FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND THE BANKS AGAINST THE 
MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND AGRARIANS. Of course, in the 
upshot everything will turn into the latest confrontation 
between the executive and legislative branches, but in fact the 
main struggle will develop not according to the political but 
the territorial-sectoral principle. The phase of struggle for 
ideas (the outward, the ostensible) and for resources (the 
essental) has ended and smoothly moved into the phase of 
struggle EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESOURCES. 
  In October 1993 sectoral groups, or more precisely a sector 
clan, the most powerful one, which is now in power -- the fuel 
and energy complex -- relying for support on power [silovyye] 
structures, financial circles, and the "Moscow grouping," got 
the upper hand over the alliance of regional leaders and the 
military-industrial complex. Now the figures of the raw 
materials sector have fewer and fewer chances of stopping their 
opponents. 
  The regionals and the military-industrial complex are on the 
offensive. The well-known meeting between the president and 
military-industrial complex representatives, culminating in the 
signing of six presidential edicts which "revitalized" the 
economy, was a clear concession to regional and sectoral (not 
raw material) leaders. 
  For its part, the fuel and energy complex does not intend to 
give in. On the contrary, it is counterattacking. Reserve 
figures are already being "deployed": The mass media have 
carried publicity for "Gazprom" leader R. Vyakhirev, V. 
Kadannikov, leader of the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company, and B. 
Berezovskiy, leader of the "LogoVAZ" joint venture (it is known 
that the automobile sector is one of the most prosperous sectors 
and its leaders are among the most loyal to the president and 
premier), Yu. Shafranik, minister for the fuel and energy 
complex, and certain other figures. 
  On Shafranik's initiative, the Association for Economic 
Collaboration is being formed (the constituent assembly is 
scheduled for 17 June), which is supposed to unite not only the 
leaders of the oil and gas complex but also its representatives 
in the Federation Council. This association will probably 
become the most powerful lobby grouping in the Russian 
parliament jointly with the "New Regional Policy" Duma faction, 
led by V. Medvedev, president of the Union of Russian Oil 
Industry Workers. 
  But not all representatives of financial circles support the 
raw material producers (just as not all regionals support the 
military-industrial complex). Many of them are keeping quiet 
for the moment, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, trying to 
understand the forces at work. Currently they are loyal to 
Chernomyrdin but it is clear that in any event it is worth 
thinking about mutual understanding with someone else. With 
whom? Soskovets? Skokov? Luzhkov? Shumeyko? Shakhray? 
Bankers are asking themselves these questions at all their 
confidential gatherings and for the moment they prefer to keep 
their finger on the pulse of most political groupings. 
  BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING OUR "RATING" IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN 
ADJUSTMENTS. 
  Thus, there has been an improvement in the positions of 
Shumeyko, who stepped up his efforts in the "proper" -- 
long-term -- direction; Skokov, around whom contacts between 
regional elites and military-industrial complex leaders 
apparently revolve; and Glazyev, who is also trying to defend 
the interests of the military-industrial complex and 
science-intensive sectors. 
  The ranks of the most influential leaders have been 
augmented 
by N. Yegorov, the new minister for nationality affairs and 
regional policy (see table), and another two Yegorovs: Sergey 
Yefimovich, president of the Association of Russian Banks, and 
Mikhail Konstantinovich, Yerin's deputy. They are kept company 
by M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma, who is 
one of the leaders most loyal to the presidential team, which 
means one of the most promising leaders, and who is being 
considered, in particular, as a candidate for the post of 
chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court. 
  State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin's rating is increasing. Not 
because the Duma's importance and authority are increasing. The 
Duma is simply a platform, an arena capable of turning an 
activist -- whether of the Communist Party or Agrarian Party -- 
into a figure of nationwide scale. A newspaper specializing in 
compiling ratings recently wrote that Yeltsin has two 
alternatives: "In the current situation Chernomyrdin, in the 
long term Zhirinovskiy." That is naive. V.V. [Vladimir 
Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] will not do any better than he did 12 
December. But as for the premier -- no comment.... Rybkin is 
another matter. The modest, quiet Rybkin is now a real 
alternative to the president. Provided, of course, as G. 
Zyuhganov asserts, the "left-wingers" and patriots agree among 
themselves about supporting a single candidate. Do not forget 
that the biggest faction in the Duma is not the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies) or "Russia's Choice" 
(70 deputies) but the indivisible bloc of communists and 
agrarians (100 deputies). 
  The list of candidates has also been augmented by such 
figures as B. Nemtsov, head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration; 
V. Sergeyev, leader of the premier's press service; A. Livshits, 
leader of the Russian Federation president's group of experts, 
A. Bryachikhin, prefect of Moscow City's Western District; yet 
another Yegorov (the fourth) -- Yevgeniy -- chief of Moscow 
government's department for supporting and developing small and 
medium-sized businesses; Yu. Petrov, chief of the State 
Investment Corporation, who has preserved his links with the 
presidential team; G. Satarov, the president's assistant for the 
Federal Assembly, who easily finds a common language with the 
most diverse political groupings; V. Medvedev, president of the 
Union of Oil Industry Workers of Russia and leader of one of the 
largest Duma factions; L. Polezhayev, head of Omsk Oblast 
Administration and chairman of the "Siberian Accord" 
Interregional Association; Yu. Nozhikov, head of Irkutsk Oblast 
Administration; K. Titov, head of Samara Oblast Administration 
and chairman of the "Greater Volga" Interregional Association; 
Yu. Matochkin, head of Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; M. 
Prusak, head of Novgorod Oblast Administration; and V. Chub, 
head of Rostov Oblast Administration. 
  We believe that our rating has at least one serious flaw -- 
it does not fully assess the level of influence of a number of 
REGIONAL leaders. This is understandable: Given the existing 
shortage of information the situation in the regions was not 
studied properly, but we have started consultations with expert 
regionalists on this question and we hope that this flaw will 
gradually be rectified. 
  It must be said that it was always the regional 
representatives who always predominated in the USSR's supreme 
power structures: The recruitment of party and soviet cadres was 
carried out in this way -- via the CPSU oblast committees. 
Following Yeltsin's victory the new Russian ruling apparatus 
was formed mainly of Muscovites. Authority is now returning to 
the old tried and true method -- plucking the necessary people 
from oblast and republic administrations. Thus, on the one 
hand, we are obtaining authorities which fit in with Russians' 
mentality but on the other the deintellectualization of the 
sphere of state management is taking place, and the place of 
luminaries, often born not in Moscow (but who, for this reasons, 
nonetheless, know Russia) but who studied at Moscow universities 
and finished their studies at the likes of Harvard, are being 
taken by collective farm chairmen and other regional chiefs (who 
then rule the state like one big collective farm), whom a 
commentator has aptly dubbed "behemoths".... 
  Our May list also featured several shady figures -- deputy 
ministers and other state officials. First, M. Yegorov, who is 
Yerin's deputy. In the opinion of experts he is now the 
strongest figure in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], at 
any rate much stronger than Yerin. Besides which he is a figure 
who clearly aspires to power. His name cropped up in connection 
with the rumors of Yerin's possible dismissal (this question, 
you will recall, was raised by a number of Duma factions after 
the murder of Ayzderdzis), when Yerin's deputies -- Yegorov 
among them -- came under the spotlight. 
  Second, P. Mostovoy (list of candidates), Chubays' first 
deputy, who is alleged to be the one actually orchestrating all 
privatization and the subdivisions of Goskomimushchestvo [State 
Committee for the Management of State Property], while Chubays 
is more of a figure-head. 
  Third, G. Petelin, leader of Chernomyrdin's secretariat, who 
in our view will be more influential than V. Kvasov, leader of 
the government apparatus. Fourth, A. Sobentsov (list of 
candidates), first deputy leader of the Russian Government 
apparatus. 
  Despite expectations, Shakhray's rating did not fall. The 
squeezing out of the latter by the "president's entourage" to 
the edge of the floor on which interregional hagglings are being 
conducted, and the inability and evidently the unwillingness of 
Chernomyrdin to defend Shakhray, have revealed the weakness of 
that particular asset of his -- the strength of his ties with 
the presidential branch and directly with the Russian Federation 
premier, but something else was revealed simultaneously: 
Shakhray is a completely autonomous figure, which means one 
that is up for grabs [razygryvayemaya]. 
  Of course, Chubays' rating fell -- as a result of his 
acquisition of an enemy like Luzhkov. Moreover, it is quite 
clear that it is Chubays who is is losing the struggle under way 
between the two biggest Russian property administrators. 
Incidentally, when preparing an "influence rating" for the 
first time two months back, we noticed that Chubays was one of 
the next candidates for being "chucked out" of the government. 
  The following candidates have moved out of the top 50 
proper into the ranks of candidates for the top 50: 
  -- A. Starovoytov, leader of Federal Agency of Government 
Communications and Information (his real influence in the last 
"rating" was by all accounts exaggerated), 
  -- M. Nikolayev, president of the Republic of Sakha-Yakutia 
(maybe because he was dependent on "De Beers" and became a 
politician not so much on a Russian as an international scale), 
  -- M. Maley, chairman of the Security Council's 
Interdepartmental Commission (has sunk to the bottom), 
  -- A. Sobchak and G. Popov, leaders of the Russian Movement 
for Democratic Reforms, did not keep their places in our list. 
  As always, the band of the most influential politicians is 
not limited to 50. In our opinion candidates for inclusion in 
the list of the 50 most influential politicians are: 
  A. Sobchak, G. Popov, M. Maley, M. Nikolayev, A. 
Starovoytov, 
V. Kadannikov, N. Gonchar, A. Ilyushenko, P. Mostovoy, A. 
Volskiy, I. Golembiovskiy, V. Zhirinovskiy, V. Zorkin, A. 
Tuleyev, A. Rutskoy, G. Yavlinskiy, N. Travkin, A. Solzhenitsyn, 
R. Aushev, A. Kokoshin, B. Gromov, Yu. Petrov, Ye. Shaposhnikov, 
E. Rossel, Ye. Yegorov, A. Makarov, A. Sobentsov, B. Nemtsov, A. 
Bryachikhin, A. Livshits, V. Sergeyev, P. Aven, B. Berezovskiy, 
S. Rodionov, V. Bokser, N. Ryzhkov, R. Orekhov, A. Kotenkov, V. 
Alekperov, Ye. Lakhova, V. Groshev, V. Vinogradov, Yu. Nozhikov, 
L. Polezhayev, K. Titov, Yu. Matochkin, M. Prusak, O. Poptsov, 
I. Shurchkov, S. Yushenkov, S. Kovalev, V. Shcherbakov, A. 
Galazov, G. Satarov, V. Medvedev, L. Sukhanov, V. Chub, and M. 
Rakhimov. 
  Since we have highlighted a number of little-known "shady" 
figures -- and in Russia it is customary to classify politicians 
as those to whom the mass media are attracted -- we once again 
remind you of what we mean by the word "politician." By leading 
politicians we mean leaders (of parties and political movements, 
executive and legislative organs, information and commercial 
structures...), possessing the greatest RESOURCES AND POTENTIAL 
in making and ensuring the implementation of state and political 
decisions. Putting it simply, those who hold the levers 
controlling society and the state. These, our domestic history 
shows us, are traditionally not so much tribunes, ideologues, or 
even party leaders as functionaries and apparatchiks -- akin to 
spiders, spinning their web of power day and night. That is the 
reality.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Vice President Aleksandr </F>
Rutskoy by Sergio Sergi in Moscow; date not given: "I Will 
Revive Russia" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Rutskoy speaks. First reluctantly, then 
the floodgates open. He is shut up at home, like a caged lion, 
studying, writing, and meditating after his defeat in October 
1993, a defeat that burns like the white parliament building 
burned. The former vice president is contemplating retaliation, 
but it is no easy matter. Yeltsin is still in the Kremlin, and 
the opposition is hardly the picture of unity. He would like to 
be its leader, but agreement is hard to reach. The matter will 
be on the agenda of the major "patriotic assembly" scheduled for 
September. Target: the presidential elections. A month ago, 
Rutskoy said: "We will defeat the regime in May 1995." Is that 
how it will be? "I said that we will celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in different 
conditions, when a regime that is against the people is no 
longer in power. We must build up a mass movement, a popular 
movement, that will win power." 
  [Sergi] You have given a movement of this type two years to 
grow... 
  [Rutskoy] Yes, a phase that we refer to as "accumulation of 
capital" is needed. We envisage permanent membership and rigid 
discipline, almost like a party, but converting the movement 
into a party is the long-term prospect. The purpose of the 
movement will be to unite the various socially-oriented 
patriotic currents. 
  [Sergi] You have complained that the opposition failed to 
win 
owing to lack of unity... 
  [Rutskoy] October 1993 was not only a tragedy, it was the 
crucial moment in which the dice were cast for the fate of the 
state: It had to choose between a road leading nowhere and the 
path toward a democratic society enjoying social justice. But 
there was no popular mass movement, no united opposition with a 
concrete platform, so the opposition was defeated. The other 
parties merely fled, communists included. There was just 
Rutskoy... 
  [Sergi] However, you have criticism for yourself as well? 
  [Rutskoy] Of course, but Rutskoy stood firm. He did not run 
away; he held out to the end. Those who held out to the end 
with me were the dead, the wounded, and the mutilated. When 
they ask me now who I believe in, I say that I believe in those 
who defended the power of the people and democracy in those 
decisive days. Those in whom I do not believe are the ones who 
watched the tragedy from a distance and are now trying to take 
the credit as saviors of the people. 
  [Sergi] Do you not think that, to build up a mass political 
movement, you will also have to talk to people whose views are 
not identical to your own? 
  [Rutskoy] In the initial phase, the purpose of the movement 
is to unite parties and movements. The opposition must have 
clear goals and strategies rooted in the law. Man lives by 
objective and subjective laws. Equality before the law means 
democracy, and man must be able to live decently, to develop his 
potential without limits and restrictions, with rights, freedom, 
and social guarantees. Moreover, if Russia wishes to remain a 
state, it must obviously remain a major power. 
  [Sergi] And how can this strategic project be accomplished? 
  [Rutskoy] First of all, it needs stability, and words are 
not 
enough: There must be deeds. There is no need to sign 
agreements on social harmony to render a society stable; 
priorities must be set: housing, food and clothing supplies, 
health, education, the environment, six issues that affect 
social stability. But respect for the law, social discipline, 
behavior according to certain rules, discipline at work, and 
discipline in business to prevent it from becoming speculation 
are needed as well. It must all be rooted in the law. And the 
president will follow. Mussolini used to say, more or less, 
that the duce elected by the people was above the law. We all 
know what became of him. 
  [Sergi] Will you manage to win the Russians over in two 
years? 
  [Rutskoy] The movement can have a future when the leader and 
the movement itself present a definite, clear platform to the 
people. How long have I taken to explain it to you? Five 
minutes. Have you understood what I have said? What can be 
deleted from my scheme of things? If we take out the law, the 
Constitution will collapse. The president must not be someone 
who seizes control of all the command buttons. The 
Constitution, which, moreover, was approved with distortions, 
does not envisage presidential responsibility. If I were 
president, the first thing I would do is add a chapter 
establishing the responsibilities of the citizen and the public 
officials referred to in the Constitution. But nothing changes 
here. First we had the emperor, then the "gensek." The same 
people, painted in a different color, are still in the Kremlin 
today. Yeltsin has torn up his party membership card. Before, 
he was a... handball player, then he tore up his membership card 
and became a tennis player. 
  [Sergi] Do you think the leader of the movement and the 
presidential candidate will necessarily be you? 
  [Rutskoy] It would be immodest to say it must be me. 
However, it must be a person who stood up in October 1993. The 
nation cannot have a leader who lurked in the bushes. If 
someone like that appears on the scene, I shall never give way. 
Giving way to someone who turned tail at the decisive moment 
would mean getting the same thing that we have now. I entered 
politics in 1990, I am neither one of the nomenklatura, nor a 
bureaucrat, nor a civil servant. I came in off the streets. I 
used to fly, I served in the Air Force, I fought. My ideas were 
not born today; I brought them into politics with me in 1990, 
and I have never backed down from my position. I have finished 
writing a book on "The Fall of the Empire," and I have begun 
work on another, "The Acquisition of Trust." Russia is a 
country of extraordinary wealth, but it does not know how to use 
it in the interests of the nation. I have never entertained 
ideas of dominating the world, nor has Russia ever laid claim to 
superiority. Russia and the Soviet Union have played a 
stabilizing role in the world system. Russia must now regain 
this role, and so it must be powerful and democratic, with a 
just society. The state has always taken first place here, 
ideology relegating man to second place. But my ideology brings 
man right to the fore. Any idea can be discredited, buried in 
the dust. Hitler killed off the idea of national socialism, 
Yeltsin has done so for the idea of democracy. Of course, 
quoting Hitler as an example... but what can you do? It is 
history. 
  [Sergi] As far as one can make out, everyone, starting with 
yourself, in this phase of Russian political history, has gone 
for the issue of patriotic nationalism, but everyone sees it in 
his or her own way. Yourself, Zhirinovskiy, Solzhenitsyn, and 
even Yeltsin... 
  [Rutskoy] But if you read Solzhenitsyn's essay on the set-up 
that he envisages for Russia, you will see that his vision 
matches mine perfectly. The only thing on which I disagree with 
Solzhenitsyn is his view that Russia must not aspire to major 
power status. I, and I am not alone in this, am convinced that 
weakness merely inspires compassion and that only strength can 
engender respect. Russia will not be accorded respect as long 
as it is weak. Yes, the term "patriotic" is being bandied about 
by a lot of people, but what sort of patriotism is Yeltsin's if 
he has dismantled the Soviet Union? Nazi Germany failed to 
defeat the power that was the USSR in four years. Three drunken 
idiots, acting hand in glove, signed a document demolishing that 
power while the fourth -- Gorbachev -- went off and left them to 
it because he lacked the strength of mind to stop them. The 
responsibility for the destruction of this power rests on those 
four men. And look at the humiliating situation into which 
Russia has fallen thanks to Yeltsin's patriotism, and look how 
Kozyrev is behaving. His foreign policy is no better than a 
doormat. The "Americanization" of foreign policy has brought us 
what we have in Russia today, and look at the result: The 
celebrations for the anniversary of the Normandy landings have 
taken place without Russian participation. As for 
Zhirinovskiy's patriotism, it is idiotism, not patriotism. 
  [Sergi] But who is Zhirinovskiy talking to? 
  [Rutskoy] There is a vacuum, and, as we know, nature abhors 
a 
vacuum, so it gets filled with Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Sergi] Do you really believe that Russia can be reborn? 
  [Rutskoy] The USSR cannot be reborn in the form in which it 
existed before. It was a cow that used to chew the cud in its 
head in Russia and had its udder in the republics for milking. 
I would not need a union along those same lines. Anyone who 
wants to come back into Russia as a subject of the Federation is 
welcome to do so, the doors are open. Those who choose not to, 
well, it is their own business. But relations with the latter 
must be based on international principles: The frontiers will 
be closed, and gas, electricity, oil, and raw materials will all 
have to be sold at world market prices. After a month, the 
peoples of those nations will throw their leaders out. There is 
no need to drag anyone kicking and screaming into Russia; they 
will come of their own accord, and it will be a union of 
peoples, a state that has regained its historical perspective. 
The frontiers must be strictly closed. At the slightest sign of 
disrespect toward Russia, electricity, gas, and all other 
supplies will be cut off. We shall send a wagonload of cognac 
with our congratulations upon complete independence. A month 
later those same rulers will no longer be in government, as they 
will have been kicked out by their own peoples. 
  [Sergi] But this is what Zhirinovskiy is promising too... 
  [Rutskoy] No, by no means. He has other mechanisms in mind. 
  [Sergi] So you think there can be a second union, but that 
joining will be voluntary, not by annexation. 
  [Rutskoy] Absolutely voluntary annexation. All that it will 
take will be a referendum, then it will be back into Russia as a 
member of the Federation with equal economic and political 
rights. 
  [Sergi] Are you not afraid that a platform like that might 
alarm the rest of the world? 
  [Rutskoy] What fears could it raise? Did the Soviet Union 
ever hold Italy in its power or say it had national interests in 
Italy? Then why not be afraid of the United States, which sent 
planes to bomb Yugoslavia from Italian territory? Why fear the 
USSR and not the United States? The world is an axis, and the 
axis is the sword. It all depends on who holds it by the hilt. 
The axis is more stable when it rests on two supports: one 
power and another power. On the other hand, if a single power 
holds the axis... 
  [Sergi] Do you miss the days when there were two 
superpowers? 
  [Rutskoy] I miss nothing. I say this is the way it must be, 
and, if I become president, this is how it will be. I know how 
to do it; without intimidation. I know how to build up 
relations in such a way that they do not regard you as an enemy. 
  [Sergi] Would you sign the NATO's Partnership for Peace now? 
  [Rutskoy] No. It is not a Partnership for Peace, it is a 
partnership for subjugating Russia. No patriot would ever sign 
a document like that, as it would be a betrayal of the nation. 
  [Sergi] What do you have to say about the forthcoming G-7 
meeting? 
  [Rutskoy] Russia will never be a member of the Big Seven. 
The G-7 will never become the G-8 as long as Russia is in a 
humiliating position. 
  [Sergi] But Russia is a country rich in resources... 
  [Rutskoy] The USSR experienced a 17-percent drop in national 
income over the four years of the World War. It has plummeted 
by 45 percent in the three years of the reforms. Industrial 
output fell by 24 percent in four years of war, and it has now 
fallen by 60 percent. 
  [Sergi] I imagine you will have read Yeltsin's book. Is the 
anecdote about the Italian shoes that you recommended to the 
president to improve his image true? 
  [Rutskoy] Quite true, but he left out the fact that he took 
those shoes. And he also took clothes and everything else that 
some Italian friends of mine had brought me.

<F P=106> [Account by Dmitriy Orlov of interview with Russian Deputy </F>
Premier Sergey Shakhray: "Forecast: The State's Future Should 
Not Be Decided Within the Garden Ring, Russian Government Deputy 
Chairman Sergey Shakhray Believes"] 
  [Text] When speaking about Russia's future it is necessary 
to bear in mind that events may develop in various ways. It is 
feasible that the country may either enter a state of chaos and 
disintegration, become a police state, or emerge as a real 
federation with developed local self-government. 
  I am convinced that federalism today is the only means of 
preserving a stable political regime and state unity. That is 
why it is so important to formulate a state regional policy. 
Its main objectives should be to even out the position of 
citizens in all regions, guarantee human rights and citizens' 
rights, and protect the territorial integrity and unity of the 
economic area. 
  The main conflict within the Russian Federation's state 
system resides in the existence of ethnic and territorial models 
for the organization of authority in the regions. There is real 
asymmetry within the federation, and equalizing the status of 
oblasts and kray to the level of republics within the Russian 
Federation means considerably relieving this asymmetry. But the 
conflict between the ethnic and territorial models will take its 
toll on the Russian state system for a long time to come. 
  Contrary to the assessments being heard today, Russia is a 
federation based not on a treaty but a constitution. At the 
same time Articles 11 and 78 of the Russian Federation 
Constitution enable the diversity of the state's regions to be 
preserved while the Federation Treaty is an instrument of the 
law in force. However, the treaty-based form of delimiting 
authority between organs of federal power and Federation 
components may be used with regard to republics that have not 
signed the Federation Treaty. The constitutional norms 
regulating the demarcation of powers are primarily imperfect in 
that the legislature and judiciary are excluded from this 
process. This has led to the government and other executive 
organs virtually having a monopoly on deciding the substance of 
national policy. 
  There is another problem in relations between the center and 
the regions: Federation components received the right to 
legislate and are making vigorous use thereof. At the moment 
one is not conscious of pressure from local legislation, but 
there is a threat of unified legal standards becoming weakened. 
It is absolutely essential that the federal parliament retains 
its unsurpassable initiative in respect of the fundamentals of 
legislation. "Model" legislation is needed -- standard acts 
which are generally borrowed by republic parliaments and kray 
and oblast legislative assemblies. What is more, the Law on the 
Constitutional Court must finally undergo a second reading 
because the federal executive and legislature do not have the 
authority to abrogate acts adopted by Federation components. It 
is the Constitutional Court that can determine the framework of 
the treaty process governing the mutual delegation of powers and 
demarcation of objects of jurisdiction between the center and 
the regions. Many people say that any kind of treaty process 
brings down the Federation. However we would remind you that 
three years ago Russia and Tatarstan flexed their muscles at one 
another. They had enough courage to resolve the conflict by 
first economic agreements and then a bilateral treaty. In my 
view the same mechanism is quite applicable in relations between 
Kiev and Simferopol and in conditions in the Dniester Region and 
Karabakh. 
  In our view, interregional economic associations represent a 
system compelling state centers in the CIS countries to embark 
on integration by means of reciprocal treaties. On that basis a 
confederative core of three or four states can and must be 
created within the CIS. Otherwise the processes of integration 
could be uncontrolled. 
  Nor must one forget that, given the separatism in a number 
of 
regions, market relations do not eliminate but intensify the 
regional imbalances. In this connection prices of power and 
railroad transport tariffs must be subject to mandatory 
regulation. One must also bear in mind the fact that certain 
regions are wholly "tied" to the fuel and energy complex, the 
military-industrial complex (Udmurtia), or the agro-industrial 
complex (Altay) and regional state administrative and economic 
structures are being consolidated, yet the configuration of the 
Moscow political elite virtually does not reflect these 
processes. 
  The state's future should not be decided within the Garden 
Ring, otherwise the "rules of play" will not be accepted by all 
the participants.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Years of Destruction"] </F>
  [Text] The Communist Party of the Russian Federation 
Central Committee Presidium and the Communist faction in the 
State Duma has issued a statement on the policy of the 
destruction of the foundations of Russia's economic life which 
has been pursued over the past three years. The statement says, 
among other things: 
  For the past three years the greatest tragedy has been 
unfolding before the eyes of millions of people in our country. 
With the adoption of the Declaration on the Sovereignty of 
Russia and the election of B. Yeltsin as president, a disastrous 
course of so-called "reforms" designed to take society back to a 
wild and barbaric capitalism has been inflicted on the peoples 
of a great country. 
  While promising to extricate Russia rapidly from the 
economic 
crisis, the president and his government have plunged it into an 
even deeper, all-embracing crisis. The decline in production in 
the country has passed the 50-percent mark and its most 
important sectors are on the verge of self-destruction. The 
retooling of enterprises has virtually come to a standstill. 
Agriculture, precision machine building, and the textile and 
light industries are near to total collapse. Basic science and 
other forms of scientific research are being wound down. The 
president's attempts to create by his edicts the semblance of a 
campaign against the economy's rapid collapse are merely 
aggravating it. In the past three years there has been a sharp 
stratification of society and the guarantees of citizens' rights 
to work, free education and medical help, security in old age, 
and a youth full of confidence in the future have been destroyed. 
  Inflation and the uncontrolled rise in prices, unemployment 
and intellectual bankruptcy, and bloody interethnic conflicts 
and crime exceeding all bounds have become the daily 
accompaniments to millions of people's lives. The process of 
the nation's degeneration has begun. 
  In these conditions, the statement goes on to say, any state 
leader with even a modicum of self-respect would be obliged to 
quit the political stage and recognize the failure of his course 
and the unprofessionalism and erroneousness of his decisions. 
However, we do not see even the slightest desire to change a 
course which has brought grief and suffering to many millions of 
people. 
  Bearing this is mind, the Communist Party of the 
Russian Federation and its faction in the State Duma urge all 
truly patriotic and democratic forces to unite in the legitimate 
struggle for a radical change of Russian state policy, the 
departure of the ruling regime from the political arena, the 
abolition of the institution of the presidency, and the creation 
of a government that enjoys the people's trust. 
  Moscow, 10 June 1994.

<F P=106> [Open letter from V.V. Kadannikov of the All-Russia </F>
Automobile Alliance group: "Two Billion Reward for Information"] 
  [Text] Blood was spilled yet again in Moscow 7 June. 
Three shots, three terrorist acts, cost the lives of several of 
our fellow citizens, and dozens of Russians received wounds. 
The victims were a driver, a nurse, a worker, a housewife, and 
the president of a company -- the criminals spare no one. 
Especially those who carry out practical transformations in the 
Russian economy and defend people's right to a dignified life. 
  Boris Berezovskiy, general director of the All-Russian 
Automobile Alliance, was wounded 7 June. It was pure chance 
that one of the initiators of a major Russian project in which 
millions of Russians have put their faith and invested their 
savings survived. His comrade standing nearby was killed. 
  It has become clear once and for all that a parallel power 
of 
criminals and murderers is arising in Russia. 
  Those who support the president and the government, who are 
trying to revive the economy, demand that a stop be put to the 
existing mayhem forthwith. Both organized crime and the state 
executive apparatus must finally understand: Enough is enough! 
  We demand that emergency measures be adopted to ensure the 
safety of Russian citizens. If the law-enforcement organs need 
extraordinary powers to do this, they must be given them; if 
additional material and financial resources are needed, they 
will be provided. 
  Our demand is that the criminals be found. We accordingly 
announce that anyone who provides information leading to the 
exposure of the instigators and perpetrators of the terrorist 
act perpetrated against the leadership and staffers of the 
All-Russia Automobile Alliance will be paid a reward of two 
billion rubles. We guarantee confidentiality.

<F P=106> [Article by political Analyst Aleksey Kiva: "We Have Been </F>
Independent for Three Years"] 
  [Text] Let us recall the starting point of the roots 
of Russian sovereignty which basically gave life to the new 
Russia. These were the last years of the Gorbachev period, when 
as a result of the glasnost and openness which had just begun, 
we Russians learned how much our communist rulers had hidden 
from us. Extremely tough questions came to the fore. Why, for 
example, were the majority of Russians so poor? Poorer than the 
inhabitants of many other republics which did not possess our 
wealth or our intellectual, scientific, and technical potential. 
Why should wealth flow out of Russia on such a scale, ending up 
in other republics and God knows where? 
  According to calculations made by the well-known economist 
Nikolay Shmelev, resources worth $50 billion were redistributed 
every year across the USSR at Russia's expense -- this was an 
inescapable fact. The "industrial giants" bypassed by 
structural perestroyka turned into museums of the early 
industrial age. Villages in the central chernozem oblasts became 
depopulated. Roads everywhere fell into disrepair. The 
incidence of infectious diseases increased. The birth rate 
fell.... 
  One question followed another. Why was the Soviet imperial 
center rapaciously exploiting Russia and literally plundering 
irreplaceable natural resources? Why were people's living 
environments being so criminally poisoned? Was it justified in 
peacetime to have such an enormous military-industrial complex 
employing at least 70 percent of the nation's potential? 
  Basically, Russia resolved to take its fate into its own 
hands through force of circumstance. Maybe many of us have 
forgotten how the question of Russia's sovereignty arose and why 
this idea met with practically universal approval in the old 
RSFSR Supreme Soviet, which was composed primarily of Communist 
deputies. It touches on the question of who started to "destroy 
the Union" and why. 
  The truth is that "great Russia" was destroyed by the 
Communists themselves; moreover they destroyed it long ago, even 
before the period of Gorbachev's perestroyka. They destroyed it 
because they tried to realize the utopia of communism. The 
August 1991 putsch merely exposed what had been rotting for a 
long time -- both the system and the empire state. 
<H5>  What Have We Achieved During the Last Three Years? </H5>
  First. It was possible to get the breakup of the 
USSR under control through the establishment of the CIS. Russia 
was thereby able to avoid a full-scale civil war. 
Let us call all these things by their names. Russia was an 
empire. But it is unlikely that any of us living in Russia now 
would interpret the "soft breakup" of the USSR as a blessing for 
Russia. Even when we contemplate the sad experience of 
Yugoslavia, where force was used to impede a similar process of 
collapse. Too many negative consequences are apparent to us 
now. This assessment is the task of future historians. 
  Second. During the years since independence 
we have been able to dismantle communism as a value 
system. For a whole series of reasons, real socialism 
proved to be more deep-rooted in its homeland than in the 
"fraternal countries" of Europe. In our country, the "farewell 
to real socialism" dragged on for almost three years. Only the 
disappearance of the soviets made the revanchist task of the 
communist and patriotic forces practically unrealizable. 
  Third. I consider the adoption of a new 
Constitution and the holding of parliamentary elections to be an 
extremely important landmark in the development of Russia as a 
new democratic state. On the one hand, a line was drawn under 
the communist system that had existed in the country. On the 
other hand, the fundamental principles of a new social 
system were established, based on the same principles which 
exist in the most prosperous countries in the world. 
  However complex the composition of the present Federal 
Assembly, particularly the State Duma, it is nevertheless not 
the former Supreme Soviet. The Duma undoubtedly has a 
constructive core of deputies, and it operates as a lawmaking 
organ. 
  Fourth. Conditions have been created to implement the 
ideas of civil accord. It is not simply a matter of 
signing or not signing the Treaty on Civil Accord. We have 
started to address a task which goes far beyond the framework of 
the powers both of the present parliament and the president 
alike. This is an all-embracing task, the solution to which 
will affect the future of our nation and our country for years 
and decades to come. It is starting right now with the 
resolution of political problems. 
  It is no secret that some people who consider themselves 
supporters of democracy have reproached President Boris Yeltsin 
with not exploiting the situation that existed after the events 
of 3-4 October 1993; they urged him to use tough methods in 
order to speed up the establishment of social, economic, and 
other preconditions for a subsequent and more robust 
acceleration of democracy. But this would have meant replacing 
the reforms model wholesale and sending the country down a 
slippery path fraught with dangers. 
  Fifth. During the past few years we have 
managed to set in motion the flywheel of market relations. 
It is possible to give a negative assessment of our embryonic 
half-wild and half-mafia market. We can lament the fact that it 
has not become civilized with a wave of a magic wand. Generally 
speaking, it is easy for us to wallow in catastrophic 
predictions and gloomy prophecies regarding our sad future. 
  But we can also approach the matter in a different way. 
First of all, we can display a sympathetic understanding of the 
country we live in, its customs and traditions, and whether we 
are prepared to embark right away on building a civilized and 
highly cultured society after 75 years of communist supremacy. 
  It would not hurt us to open our eyes a little wider in 
order 
to appreciate what has been achieved and secured in the last few 
years. Not only the rights and freedoms that are being 
implemented in practice. There is also the abundance of goods 
we have never had before. We have seen the last of the "food 
trains," "food buses," and so forth. We no longer have to waste 
time looking for carrots and sausages. Opportunities the like 
of which we never dreamed before have opened up. 
  Yes, there are plenty of ugly features in our lives. We are 
strangled by corruption. We are oppressed by bureaucracy. And 
criminals are becoming more audacious every day. Economic 
reform sometimes operates at half cock or simply idles along. 
We must correct all this, refine it, and perhaps change it 
radically. Only without panic or hysterics. 
  And finally. A new reforms course has been mapped out, 
the fight against crime is being stepped up, and the Treaty of 
Civil Accord has begun to be implemented. 
  HOWEVER, WHAT HAVE WE NOT MANAGED TO ACHIEVE over the recent 
period? First, we have been unable to avoid acutely conflictual 
social development and confrontation between the various 
branches of power, which ultimately led to the tragic events of 
October 1993. Second, we have been unable to avoid a number of 
mistakes and errors in the economic sphere, mistakes which can 
hardly be termed inevitable. Third, literally right from the 
start of the reforms the reformers have been unable to establish 
a permanent dialogue with the people, something which would have 
enabled them to secure greater understanding and support from 
the people, including amendments to the reforms course. I am 
sure the social cost of the reforms could be reduced if a more 
skillful policy were to be pursued. 
  Finally, it has not proved possible to reduce the acuteness 
of the social discomfort experienced by many Russians, their 
loss of social and moral guidelines, and even their loss of 
faith in the future. Why has this happened? In my view, 
because the new authorities have not put forward in good time an 
attractive social model to replace real socialism and have not 
proposed a new system of moral and spiritual values. The 
mistake was that it was necessary to provide an answer 
straightaway to the questions which have been worrying society 
-- "What are we building?" and "Where are we going?" 
  Who knows, under our specific conditions we may not have 
made 
the worst of starts. At any rate Russia is by no means losing 
out when viewed against the backdrop of the other former USSR 
republics. Including countries like Ukraine, Belorussia 
[Belarus], or Kazakhstan, which initially tried to introduce a 
different, profoundly centralized reform model. It has not 
worked. This means that we are on the right track, however hard 
it may be.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for 
Environmental Security, by Lada Lyashenko; date, place not 
given: "Nature Does Not Forgive Carelessness"] 
  [Text] [Lyashenko] Aleksey Vladimirovich, you have 
frequently said that it is impossible for any country to have a 
future if it does not protect the environment. Will the new 
decree [On Russian Government Action Plan for Environmental 
Protection for 1994-1995] help our environment? 
  [Yablokov] Undoubtedly. This decree is the first step in 
carrying out the not unknown Edict of the President dated 4 
February of this year, which instructed the government to 
elaborate a specific plan of action for the protection of the 
environment for 1994-1995 and present a concept for its 
consistent development by 1 October. The plan of action has 
been elaborated by the Ministry for the Protection of the 
Environment together with the Ministry of the Economy, which is 
very important. For the first time, we are not setting the 
environment against the economy, but bringing them together. 
This step signifies the beginning of a new state policy in the 
sphere of the protection of the environment. After all, policy 
is when people who adopt decisions look far into the future. 
The shortcoming of today's politicians is that they most often 
adopt decisions for today. And after all, the environment is a 
matter of the future. 
  [Lyashenko] What basic guidlines for the protection of the 
environment have been elaborated in the government's plan of 
action? 
  [Yablokov] Primarily international cooperation. We need to 
determine how Russia fits into global ecological problems, such 
as the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect, and the protection of 
the oceans. Equally important are regional problems -- Lake 
Baykal, the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, and the Volga. After 
all, this is not just a matter of individual regions. The 
health of the population, which is deteriorating disastrously, 
is a special sphere. Despite the fact that the Ministry for the 
Protection of the Environment assures us that the situation is 
improving, there are grounds for concern. In 1993 alone, the 
average lifespan fell by three years. A boy born this year has 
no chance of even reaching pension age, since average life 
expectancy for men by that time will be 59. And after all, our 
health depends on the environment by approximately 30 percent. 
  The new decree is also important because all the federal 
programs and legislative acts named in it have been coordinated 
with the relevant State Duma committees. 
  [Lyashenko] Will it not turn out that we will once again put 
off ecological problems till later and our good intentions will 
be left hanging in mid-air? 
  [Yablokov] Unless we organize constant pressure on the 
government, and in the mass media too, then nothing will be 
done. Remember how it all began: The explosion of the 
ecological movement occurred in 1987-1989, then people forgot 
about it, and the economic confusion began. Today we have gone 
back to the original positions, because the burden of the 
environmental load is so heavy that the country may stumble and 
there may simply be no economic development. A very great deal 
in the implementation of the outlined program depends on the 
regions. After all, the government cannot operate by giving 
orders any more, like it used to in the past. And indeed this 
would not work economically: A large part of the money is in 
the localities. 
  [Lyashenko] Are you satisfied with the normative base of the 
decree? 
  [Yablokov] On the whole, yes. There are just a few sections 
of wording that do not suit me. For example, the law on waste 
from production and consumption. This concept is too broad. I 
think that we need a law on particularly dangerous waste. That 
kind of wording is more precise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Vladimir Avdiyskiy, chief of </F>
Russian Federation Tax Police Department Control and Auditing 
Administration, by Nikolay Ivanov; place and date not given: 
"The Tax Police Has Restored 630 Billion Rubles to the Budget. 
And This in Just Three Months"] 
  [Excerpts] Has the tax police succeeded in protecting 
state interests in the economic sphere? With this question 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's correspondent began his conversation with 
Major General Vladimir Avdiyskiy, chief of the Russian 
Federation Tax Police Department Control and Auditing 
Administration. [passage omitted] 
  [Avdiyskiy] Commercial structures account for most 
violations of legislation, for they outstrip state enterprises 
by almost 10 times in terms of this indicator. Partnerships 
with limited liability account for a large percentage (25 
percent), and then come private enterprises (11 percent), 
followed by closed-type joint-stock companies and joint ventures. 
  What methods are used? All sorts of international contracts 
and treaties constitute one of the most widespread methods 
today. To put it more concretely -- the transfer [peregon] of 
money. Look: I touch a computer key, and the state of 
Liechtenstein, let us assume, appears on the screen. What do we 
have there? There we have N., a certain Russian emigre, who has 
links with some 20 firms and private individuals in all the CIS 
countries. 
  [Ivanov] How many joint ventures do we have in Russia? 
  [Avdiyskiy] If I give the figure 6,359, this was how many 
joint ventures, organized with firms in 112 foreign countries, 
were operating last year. The United States, Germany, China, 
and Finland are in the lead here. 
  Only I am in no way saying that they are all definitely 
swindling. Certainly not. But many merit a certain monitoring. 
  [Ivanov] What of the results? What specifically has the tax 
police done for Russia? 
  [Avdiyskiy] Here we can now use the language not of 
percentages but of figures. During the first quarter of this 
year an additional 630 billion rubles [R], U.S.$2 million, and 
700,000 German marks were credited to the state's budget jointly 
with the State Tax Service. This was close to the indicators 
that we had during the whole of last year! This year over 300 
criminal cases have been instituted on the basis of tax police 
materials. The second quarter also promises to be no less 
"fruitful": Checks are being completed which already, in the 
preliminary work on them, entail the concealment of profits from 
taxation on a particularly large scale, i.e. they come under the 
corresponding article of the Criminal Code. There is also a 
growing number of offenses for which the sanctions are fines of 
R1 billion and more; whereas 69 such cases were registered last 
year, 42 were registered just during the first three months of 
this year. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Leskov: "International Forum Brings </F>
Together New Boys in the Computer World"] 
  [Text] The Fifth International Computer Forum, which 
traditionally assembles the world market leaders in information 
technology, has opened at the International Trade Center. The 
International Computer Forum is an elite gathering of computer 
people -- tickets for the event are not on sale, you cannot just 
"walk in" off the street. Each year the International Computer 
Forum marks a stage in the country's progress toward the 
assimilation of modern information technology. 
  This time around 600 computer industry leaders were 
registered in Moscow. Some of the ever-presents -- such as the 
famous "Borland" -- decided to miss out on this forum. On the 
one hand, this looks like a slight, but most often refusal is 
due to the fact that the leading computer firms in Russia 
already have a network of dealers and distributors, and they 
usually display only innovations at the Moscow forum. The 
International Computer Forum differs from the larger "Komtek" 
exhibition in that the forum is not a trade fair but a place to 
draw attention to your name. The practice of previous forums 
shows that invitations to the International Computer Forum are 
much in demand and are sold and resold at large "mark-ups." 
  In the opinion of Mikhail Mishustin, chairman of the 
International Computer Club Board, the distinctive feature of 
Russia's computer market in 1994 will be the increasing 
activeness of managers who have been trained in the West. 
Talented programmers who have surprised their colleagues with 
their output play a secondary role, while the businessmen, who 
just five years ago could make some kind of a living by 
reselling simple Western computers, are quite overshadowed. 
These changes show that Russia, following the example of the 
developed countries, is gradually organizing a civilized 
information technology structure. 
  The number of computers in Russia is currently put at 3 
million "PC's," while the software market is valued at $350 
million. Last year around 500,000 computers were sold in Russia 
-- still very few by the standards of the developed world. But 
attention is drawn to the increasingly widespread switch from 
286's to more modern processors. 
  The Fifth International Computer Forum was marked by the 
number of new boys in the computer world. The Banyan company, 
which has thrown down the gauntlet in the network operating 
systems market to the mighty Novell, was making its Moscow 
debut. "Entrepreneur of the Year" Dzherri Rodzhers [name as 
transliterated], president of the Cyrix firm, which destroyed 
Intel's long-standing monopoly in developing 386- and 
486-compatible processors, will be coming to Moscow. The forum 
is particularly valuable for the participation of Sisko [name as 
transliterated] Systems, the world leader in the market for 
internetwork communications -- which Russia needs more than 
anything. It is clear from the list of participants that the 
International Computer Forum is seen by Western participants as 
an important springboard for the veritable war that is currently 
being waged in the market for central processors. 
  The special events include the first presentation of 
certificates to the 100 most influential people in the Russian 
computer market -- whom we have now followed the developed 
countries in identifying. The "top 10" were also picked out. 
These included IZVESTIYA's hero -- Yevgeniy Veselov of 
"Mikroinform." Stepan Pachikov ("Paragraf") was named most 
influential person in the software sector, with Anatoliy 
Karachinskiy ("Ay-Bi-Es") getting the hardware award. The "top 
10" includes seven Russians and three foreigners.

  [Text] Ukraine intends to take part in the formation of a 
UN peace-keeping rapid deployment force. This was reported on 
Monday [13 June] to INTERFAX-Ukraine by a senior official at the 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Vladimir Yelchenko. 
  He said Ukraine is most likely to form a battalion of 
specially trained paratroopers who will be required to speak 
foreign languages. Kiev is also ready to offer Ilyushin-76 
transport planes for peace-keeping operations. 
  Yelchenko said that the final decision on the matter has not 
been made, as organizational and financial questions should be 
resolved first. He voiced hope that part of the spending on the 
formation of the Ukrainian contingent would be assumed by the 
United Nations. 
  Under the constitution the involvement of Ukrainian troops 
in 
operations overseas should be sanctioned by parliament. 
However, Yelchenko thinks that if the Ukrainian contingent is 
formed, the decision on its use will be made by the head of 
state after an appropriate appeal from the United Nations. 
  The idea of forming a UN rapid deployment force belongs to 
the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. In a letter to him last 
February President Leonid Kravchuk confirmed Ukraine's readiness 
to take part in the formation of the force.

  [Text] Moscow 13 June TASS -- Ukraine's Navy leaders 
protested on Monday [13 June] the illegal transfer of property 
from the Black Sea Fleet. 
  In a letter to the Black Sea Fleet commanders, Ukrainian 
Navy 
officers said that military equipment and property are being 
illegally transferred from the Crimean navy base and other units. 
  The letter recalled that the transportation of military 
equipment in Ukraine must be approved by the Ukrainian chief of 
general staff. 
  The authors of the letter regretted that such actions are 
happening at a time when the future of the Black Sea Fleet 
remains unclear and expressed the hope that the Black Sea Fleet 
commanders will ensure the enforcement of law and order in their 
units.

with CIS countries, above all Russia," he stressed. 
  The Ukrainian head of state believes that "the signing of 
the 
tripartite agreement, which gave the Ukraine clearcut guarantees 
for its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and financial, 
economic and technical assistance, has made a great contribution 
to improving the international situation." The president 
reminded his listeners that Ukraine was one of the first to sign 
the Partnership for Peace, and it has become a participant in 
the NATO program. But according to Leonid Kravchuk, 
"cooperation with the CIS countries remains a priority for us, 
and it was in this context that Ukraine signed all the important 
economic agreements." The president singled out Russia as "a 
traditional partner with whom we have signed over 75 documents 
of various kinds on the development of economic and political 
ties". 
  It was reported by Leonid Kravchuk that a broad-scale 
agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with 
Russia is currently being drawn up which, in his opinion, "will 
bring Ukrainian-Russian relations onto a qualitatively new level 
and will register fundamental clauses determined by our way of 
life, history, and the futures of the two countries." The 
president is reckoning on signing this document immediately 
after the problem of the Black Sea Fleet has been solved. 
  Touching on the issue of ways for Ukraine to extricate 
itself 
from the crisis, Leonid Kravchuk said that "first of all, a 
block of financial problems must be resolved: mutual 
computations, credits, the banking system." He reported to 
listeners that this program already exists and it has been 
agreed upon at all levels. The president thereby name the 
priorities for getting out of the crisis -- foodstuffs and 
energy resources. "The successful solution of these issues will 
give an impetus to the development of other sectors," Leonid 
Kravchuk stressed. In his view, it is also necessary to set up 
a normal investment climate in the country. "The laws on 
investments should be stable." 
  In his speech the president paid considerable attention to 
the issue of building a sovereign state. He thinks that "at the 
present time, it is necessary to stop any discussion on where we 
are going and what kind of society we are building." The 
forthcoming elections themselves will testify to the fact that 
the people are voting for a presidential-parliamentary republic. 
"Therefore," Leonid Kravchuk noted, "a new constitution must be 
adopted immediately after the elections, the relative power 
structures and a strong government must be set up and the 
necessary powers must be given to the president, and additional 
elections to the Supreme Soviet need to be held."

  [Text] In Lvov, Leonid Kravchuk called the local council 
elections of 26 June an attempt by Ukraine's Supreme council to 
put into practice a federative territorial state system Lvov: On 
12 June Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, visited the 
town, where he had a number of meetings. In particular, he took 
part in a conference of chairmen of rayon, oblast, and local 
councils, and between entrepreneurs and businessmen. In his 
speech Leonid Kravchuk called the local council elections of 26 
June an attempt by Ukraine's Supreme Council to put into 
practice a federative form of territorial state system without 
having elaborated the necessary legislative base, which could 
lead to an ungoverned society. 
  Together with Valeriy Shmarov, Ukraine's vice-prime 
minister, 
and Yevhen Sukhin, president of the "Ukranaftohaz" [Ukrainian 
oil and gas] joint-stock holding company, the president of 
Ukraine also attended the unveiling of a monument to Mykhaylo 
Hrushevskyy, first president of Ukraine. Later Leonid Kravchuk 
took part in the traditional Zankivchanski evenings at Lvov's 
Mariya Zankovetska state academic theater, where he held an 
improvised press conference. Leonid Kravchuk expressed himself 
in favor of a presidential-parliamentary republic and in favor 
of the election of executive, but not representative power. 
Leonid Kravchuk also noted that, notwithstanding world 
experience, he would not be influencing the general state 
process until his probable election. 
  The president noted that in the last few years there had 
been 
changes for the better in Ukraine's economy: In the 
metallurgical industry more had been done in four years than had 
been done in the 15 years up to 1990, the reconstruction of the 
oil industry is under way, Ukraine is developing its medical 
industry, and so on. 
  Describing relations with Russia, he observed that the 
accusation of Ukraine in isolation from Russia are groundless, 
because in the time since the independence of both states 
approximately 70 agreements and documents have been signed, 
including economic ones too. Namely, Ukraine was the initiator 
of free trade with Russia. 
  Replying to a question from a UNIAN correspondent about 
whether Ukraine would agree to concessions to Crimea, Leonid 
Kravchuk observed that there would not be a single concession 
regarding Ukraine's territorial integrity and that Crimea would 
remain a constituent part of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
correspondent Anatoliy Tabachenko on 13 June, place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, you are the 
incumbent president, the head of state. What is your view of 
the state of Ukraine's home and foreign affairs? 
  [Kravchuk] To be brief, we are, indeed, going through a very 
difficult time, and it is clear why. All nations making a 
transition from one system to another have gone through a 
similarly difficult time. That is why it is wrong to see only 
the negative, there is also a positive factor here. But, since 
life is very complicated, and with the rise of inflation, the 
fall of production, and various social problems involved, people 
sometimes fail to see the positive part of our life, while the 
negative factor is often used by different political forces. 
One must understand that it can be no other way, because in a 
democracy, where there is an opposition and a power struggle, 
all this is taken advantage of in a certain sense. What ways do 
we see out of this situation? First of all, we are taking very 
specific steps to create a proper industrial structure to live 
up to Ukraine's interests. 
  Second, we are solving problems concerning fuel supplies. 
Despite all the difficulties, we have been able, in the recent 
years, including the last one, to create conditions for sowing 
the harvest. The national economy continued to function in 
winter, and people were provided with heating and all 
necessities. Of course, all these factors, both positive and 
negative ones, unfortunately, negative ones to a greater extent, 
make an impact on people's feelings, socially and politically. 
  Political stability, too, has its roots in the economy, 
although there are other factors involved. We can see our 
miscalculations. Already, after two and a half years of my 
presidency, I can see how many mistakes could have been avoided, 
but, unfortunately, what has happened has happened, and we can 
only use these lessons to avoid similar mistakes in future. 
The one who wins this post can also use the mistakes we made to 
avoid repeating them in future. 
  Since Ukraine gained its independence, our foreign policy 
has 
been aimed at protecting Ukraine's interests by diplomatic 
means. The main effort was made to promote Ukraine's further 
integration with European structures, to strengthen economic and 
political relations, and to develop such relations with the CIS 
countries and with our neighbors, above all, Russia. Thanks to 
our consistent foreign policy, Ukraine has taken its place among 
world powers and is now occupying an important position on the 
international stage. The trilateral statement signed on 14 
January in Moscow made a great contribution to improving the 
international atmosphere around Ukraine. This has given us 
clear guarantees for the recognition of our sovereignty and 
territorial integrity and the granting of financial, economic, 
and technical assistance. This statement secured a world image 
for our state. Ukraine, as you know, was the first to sign 
Partnership for Peace and become part of this NATO program. On 
Tuesday, 14 June, I am going to Luxembourg where I will sign a 
document on Ukraine's accession to the European Union on the 
principles of partnership and cooperation. 
  Naturally, Ukraine as a European state will always lean 
toward close ties with Europe. But we take a realistic view of 
the situation, and we cannot follow one track only. Our 
greatest priority is cooperation within the CIS. Ukraine is 
part of the economic union. It has signed all the important 
economic agreements of the CIS. Within the CIS, we have a 
traditional, friendly partner, Russia, with whom we have signed 
over 75 documents, and agreements of various kinds regulating 
our economic, political, and other ties. A broad-scale 
agreement on cooperation, friendship, and partnership with 
Russia is currently being drawn up that will place our relations 
on a qualitatively new level and register fundamental principles 
of our relations predetermined by our way of life, our history, 
and our future. It is a very important document, and I hope we 
can sign it immediately as soon as we solve another urgent 
problem in Ukrainian-Russian relations, that of the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, what ways do you see out of 
the difficult economic situation in the light of your election 
program? 
  [Kravchuk] These ways are outlined in the election program, 
but let me focus our attention on them again. These problems 
are already being tackled today. First of all, this concerns 
the entire block of financial problems: Mutual payments, 
credits, and banking. They are the most painful and urgent ones 
today, and we not only declare them a priority, but we have 
agreed a concrete program and concrete ways of improving the 
situation with the Cabinet of Ministers and the management of 
the National Bank. 
  The second problem concerns the priorities that must be 
clearly singled out. I always put forward two priorities that I 
believe to be basic: Foodstuffs and energy. Any other problem 
can be solved in the course of time, but these two cannot wait. 
This is something a person needs every day. These two core 
priorities must be basic to all of our activities. The 
successful solution of these issues, that is the development of 
agriculture and power engineering with related industries, will 
give an impetus to the development of other sectors, because 
these are huge industries with a demand for a variety of other 
products, and will provide for the people's vital needs. 
  Another priority is the reduction of costs in all spheres of 
the national economy. This problem has never been seriously 
dealt with. Another concerns the creation of a proper investment 
climate both for domestic and foreign partners who are very 
sensitive toward any changes in our legislation and activities. 
Incidentally, Ukraine's (?constitutional) climate was extremely 
badly damaged by the cabinet's decrees amending two important 
laws passed by the Supreme Council. I attend dozens of meetings 
now that reveal a lack of confidence in ourselves. If we 
continue to change our laws as frequently, we will never be 
trusted. 
  Next are the banking, budgetary, monetary and taxation 
systems. Taxation must stimulate development. We have certain 
projects in this area that we are sending to the oblasts to 
develop them further and submit to the Supreme Council. It is 
clear that we will not be able to avoid a monetary reform. There 
is one basic principle: It cannot be implemented in a 
confiscatory manner. People must know that it will be 
implemented on the basis of social justice, openly, and without 
any secrets. 
  Next is social security. People who are today in need of 
support, pensioners, people with many children, and not all 
pensioners, but only a certain group, require both financial and 
direct aid, by means of special shops and special opportunities. 
Now, as we prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of Ukraine's 
liberation and the victory in the Great Patriotic War, 
provisions should be made and relevant directives passed on to 
the local authorities to make it work for the individual. The 
next aspect includes economic problems: Privatization and 
demonopolization. These must be pursued openly, under 
supervision. It implies problems, and there are ways of solving 
them. 
  [Tabachenko] Leonid Makarovych, how do you see further 
development of nation-building in Ukraine? 
  [Kravchuk] Nation-building currently boils down to the 
Constitution. The state must ensure the development of the 
individual, their rights and freedoms. The overriding principle 
must not be that of the individual for the state but that of the 
state for the individual. All this time, the state has been the 
best protected one. Now, we must protect the individual. But 
without a Constitution, without legal acts, this is impossible. 
Therefore, first of all, a Constitution must be adopted, 
together with elections that are already underway, and there is 
no denying that elections must be held. But the Supreme Council 
must pass laws before the elections to guarantee normal 
development of society, subordination, division of powers, and 
all related functions. Then it is necessary to stop all 
discussions as to what we are building and where we are going. 
I believe that we must be clear about what system and what form 
of government we should have. If the elections take place, and 
I am sure they will, and a president is elected, this will mean 
that the people will have voted for a presidential, 
parliamentary republic. This must put an end to all 
discussions, a Constitution must be adopted, relevant structures 
and authorities must be set up, a strong government, a strong 
president, and an authoritative Supreme Council must be formed, 
and we will proceed from there. 
  [Tabachenko] Another question, Leonid Makarovych. What can 
you say of the successes and problems in the spiritual sphere of 
our life. Because there are many complaints that it, too, is in 
decline. 
  [Kravchuk] You see, in such a period as this one, there is 
either a renaissance or a decline. Sometimes, economic decline 
may be greater, but revolutionary pathos may inspire a 
renaissance in the arts. Our development is evolutionary. This 
evolution may not be seen on the surface, which prompts some to 
say that there is some kind of a spiritual decline. I would not 
say so. No creative union has been closed down. All publishing 
houses are working, books are being published, newspapers are in 
circulation, television and radio is working, textbooks are 
being written. Yes, it is difficult, but it is there. 
Scientists are working, discoveries are being made. There have 
been a lot more discoveries and practical applications recently 
than before. We should not dramatize the situation, but look at 
it comprehensively. Yes, culture needs financial support. That 
is the way of the world. I believe that the next quarterly 
budget that will be submitted to the Supreme Council, and I have 
instructed the government to this effect, will again show 
support for the arts. 
  There are presidential decrees in support of science, 
culture, and publishing, but it is not enough. We must make 
clear budgetary provisions for such support. Using this 
opportunity, I would like to wish all radio listeners and all 
voters good spirits and good health. I hope they will all come 
to the polls, not only in the presidential but also in the local 
elections, and vote for those people who can ensure Ukraine's 
peaceful, democratic, and legal development, economic reforms 
and improvement in the people's living standards.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Plyushch, former speaker of the </F>
Ukrainian Supreme Soviet and current presidential candidate; 
place and date not given -- from the "Current Interview" feature] 
  [Text] [VYBIR] What powers must the Ukrainian president 
possess to efficiently run the country? 
  [Plyushch] If I become the president, I am not going to 
request any powers in addition to those specified by the 
Constitution. 
  [VYBIR] What about the proposals of left-wing factions in 
the 
parliament to provide the president only with representative 
functions? 
  [Plyushch] They propose this since our president was not 
able 
to efficiently use the powers delegated to him. Therefore, 
left- wingers want the parliament to possess such functions. 
However, to do this the Constitution should be amended which 
requires at least 300 votes. The left factions do not have such 
number of backers. They would have never gotten even 170 votes 
to elect the Speaker if they had not been supported by the 
president. 
  [VYBIR] Whom would you appoint to the key posts in the 
government? 
  [Plyushch] Too early to speak about that. Too early. The 
other day, I was going to go to Donetsk and came to the airport 
20 minutes before the flight but they did not permit me to enter 
the plane. They said I was 10 minutes late. Too early to speak 
about the government now. 
  [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the new speaker? 
  [Plyushch] He is an experienced politician. Mr. Moroz is 
supposed to do what he says. The speaker should have no party 
affiliation. Still, sometimes I do not understand Mr. Moroz. 
Look, he says that political council of the Socialist Party 
suspended his membership in the party, then he says that it was 
his party that nominated him as a presidential nominee, that 
communists supported him... 
  [VYBIR] What do you think of the president's proposals 
concerning the ruling posts in government? 
  [Plyushch] I haven't seen the list but I believe that a new 
premier will again become a scapegoat. 
  [VYBIR] What is your attitude to the memorandum, signed by 
communist parties of ex-Soviet republics, including Ukraine, 
concerning restoration of the USSR? 
  [Plyushch] My attitude is absolutely negative. Such activity 
of the communist party is illegal. 
  [VYBIR] Which international blocs are the most attractive 
for 
Ukraine. Where are Ukraine's interests -- in the West or East? 
  [Plyushch] We should enter the blocs which admit us. East or 
West does not matter much. We have state-of-the-art 
technologies but no investments to introduce them. We should 
try to reestablish the common market of ex-Soviet republics. 
Ukraine lost its market, sold it for nothing, for bribes. We 
gave it to false friends trying to get rich using our 
difficulties. 
  [VYBIR] Who is your chief rival in presidential marathon? 
  [Plyushch] The one who is governed by common sense. 
  [VYBIR] If you become the president, will you keep trying to 
create the Baltic-Black Sea zone? What is your attitude to the 
so- called Visegrad triangle? 
  [Plyushch] I will insist on the worldwide summit to solve 
the 
global problem facing all countries today. "Cold war" is over. 
Bipolar world exists no more. Each country has a great 
responsibility to the world community. Such summit must be 
similar to that held after WWII. Ukraine should initiate this 
process. The world community, not some countries, must be 
peace-maker today. Look, now Russia wants to be the peace-maker 
in the "near abroad" and the United Nations to play this role 
elsewhere. I am against any division of the spheres of 
influence. There are some questions as well -- today the Warsaw 
Pact does not exist, but what about NATO? 
  [VYBIR] Thank you.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 12 
June broadcasts a three-minute report by correspondent Aleksandr 
Skachenko on the upcoming elections, including an interview with 
Leonid Kuchma, former Ukrainian prime minister. 
  Skachenko begins his report by saying that the main battle 
is 
being waged in the press, where the current president, Leonid 
Kravchuk, is leading. Polls have revealed that there are three 
main contenders to the post--Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma, and 
Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the Socialist Party and parliamentary 
speaker. 
  Skachenko asks Kuchma the following question: Support given 
to you by western and eastern regions is totally different. Are 
you not afraid that your election to the post of the president 
will only increase confrontation between western and eastern 
regions of the country? 
  Kuchma replies: "I do not want to think about it because I 
think that in any situation, especially in a situation as 
crucial as this, we need to look for things to unite us. The 
economy and, naturally, the construction of a sovereign, 
independent, and democratic state ought to become our uniting 
factors. I am deeply convinced that only then will Ukraine be 
able to hope that life will be better, as they say, tomorrow. 
The economy will put everything in its place and this 
confrontation will exist no more." 
  Skachenko then says that Leonid Kuchma became head of the 
coalition government in October 1992 as a result of yet another 
political crisis. His team tried to implement market reforms 
and unsuccessfully fought against corruption. Market reforms 
died down by the spring of 1992 because of constant 
disagreements between the government and parliament. Opponents 
accused Kuchma of being too fond of Russia, of lacking strong 
will power and a united team. Kuchma resigned in the autumn of 
1993 but did not lose his popularity. He is especially popular 
with the Russian-speaking population in southern and eastern 
parts of Ukraine. 
  Asked about the possibility of Ukraine joining a new union 
with Russia, Kuchma says: "I do not know. But you know I am not 
used to being a slave. I am used to being a master and I want 
to be a master in my country, without anyone above me. I am 
really not used to it."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's people's deputy and presidential </F>
candidate Valeriy Heorhiyovych Babych by unidentified 
correspondents of the newspapers DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA, HOLOS 
UKRAYINY, URYADOVYY KURYER, KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, PRAVDA 
UKRAYINY, UKRAYINA MOLODA, NEZAVISIMOST, the Russian "Economic 
News Agency," and other mass media recorded by Yuriy Kornyev and 
Oleksandr Yaholnyk; place and date not given: "I Was Honest in 
Business, I Will Be Honest in Politics"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The newspaper NOVOSTI carried 
Leonid Kuchma's commentary on your participation in presidential 
elections in which he alleges that you are a "man of straw." 
What can you say in this connection? 
  [Babych] When I registered myself as a candidate for 
Ukraine's Supreme Council deputy, there were 17 persons 
altogether, who were put to the vote. I swore that I would not 
say a single bad word about any one of them and will not 
characterize their actions or conclusions. 
  I have now made the same promise to God: I will not say a 
single bad word about a single presidential candidate. I 
believe that our people are sufficiently intelligent and wise. 
Thus, both rank-and-file people and professionals will sort out 
various approaches and truths. I do not want to impose my 
opinion upon anybody instead of giving a direct answer. As 
regards the question that was answered by Mr. Kuchma, I can say 
this: I never was a prostitute in business and I will never be 
a prostitute in politics. I believe that this characterizes my 
actions in business in full. Those people who worked with me 
know: I never betrayed anybody and never changed my views. I 
went into politics for one simple and clear reason: I am sick 
and tired of pleading and persuading others -- "Rescue the 
economy." I have realized: Unless we ourselves assume control 
over the state and create a legislative foundation at the 
highest level, we will have to wait a long time for alms, but 
there will be no economic stabilization. Today, I have emerged 
from the "trenches," and I am ready to place my experience, 
knowledge, and views of life at the scaffold of politics in 
order to achieve a considerable improvement of the situation in 
the economy. 
  [Correspondent] Have you resigned as president of the 
investment company "The Ukrainian Financial Group" [UFG] in 
connection with your election as a Supreme Council deputy? 
  [Babych] Yes, on 13 May I signed a document on giving up my 
powers in connection with becoming a Supreme Council deputy and 
my nomination as a Ukrainian presidential candidate. My 
functions have been passed on to the acting president. I can 
only be relieved of my duties by the meeting of shareholders. 
The meeting was appointed for July-August. I would like to say 
goodbye to the shareholders and thank them for the confidence 
that they gave me for three years. I have already practically 
abandoned all these affairs. 
  It is physically impossible to combine the election campaign 
with running the UFG financial matters. That is why I have 
adopted this path. I have become fully immersed in politics. I 
am firmly convinced and will prove to others that today's 
politician must be an economist, financier, and market-oriented 
businessman, who has one goal: To enrich the state and the 
people. I believe that this is our time -- the time of the 
people who know how to do something real for the people. 
  [Correspondent] Who is financing your election campaign? 
And how? 
  [Babych] Within the framework of the Law on Elections. 
Quite a number of friends offer me funds and assist with 
technical means. As they say, I have not prostituted myself to 
any structure -- it is not in my nature. I went to elections 
with what I personally have and with the support of my friends. 
This question is emphasized because some people are lying in 
wait for me to take the first thousand dollars [as a bribe] in 
order to immediately trumpet it to the whole world and 
compromise me. 
  [Correspondent] The week of the parliament's work gives rise 
to sad reflections. If you become president, is it possible to 
work with such a parliament and implement what you have planned? 
  [Babych] You are not right. One should not be afraid of 
reaching compromise and must develop skills in finding a common 
language with different people. We must totally abandon methods 
of "coming to power" and for the sake of power, which ruthlessly 
suppresses particular groups of differently minded people. We 
must understand a simple thing: When people come to power and 
not to managing the state, the system will compel them to look 
up Communists, Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for 
Perestroyka] members, Greens or whites. I am convinced: This 
approach of the exclusive nature of one's own ideas and their 
exclusive correctness is pernicious for any nation or state. 
The programs of various parties or movements do not differ 
much. Their goal is the achievement of Ukraine's well-being. 
The question lies in something else: How to do that? Today, 
there are already people in Ukraine who know how to do that. 
  [Correspondent] Can Pynzenyk or Pylypchuk [economists and 
political figures] head the Supreme Council Economic Commission 
for Economic Reform? 
  [Babych] Reformers may head commissions. However, executive 
structures must be manned with professionals who know what to do 
and not by dilettantes who come with advice and collect advice 
on what needs to be done. For a long time, I worked in 
Derzhplan [State Planning Committee] and at the Council of 
Ministers and saw with my own eyes how much harm to the economy 
dilettantes may cause by their activity. I witnessed how two 
deputy chiefs, guided by purely ambitious motivations, refused 
to sign a joint document, even though, as a result, Ukraine lost 
hundreds of millions of dollars in old prices. 
  It is already clear to many people that a team must assume 
executive control. Whether good or bad -- a team. A creative 
team and not a team of those who will pocket wealth. That is 
why I am in favor of a stringent system of a team assuming 
control. 
  Regarding a legislative basis, I am quite comfortable in my 
attitude toward the assembly of people of different 
nationalities and political parties that have gathered at the 
Supreme Council. Yes, discussions must be held there, various 
issues must be disputed and resolved, and they must be 
implemented by a team. The main question, which was not 
answered by the preceding parliament and which must be resolved 
by the parliament of the present convocation, is what we are 
going to build. Inflation has driven the economy into such a 
situation that a question naturally arises: What methods will 
we employ in the management of the economy -- administrative 
state, that is to say socialist, or market-oriented ones? This 
question is presently the principal one. Unless we answer it, 
all our subsequent efforts will be in vain. The present 
mechanism is only advantageous for department bureaucrats. They 
successfully use what suits them best. For example, they get 
money through the state system and pay for communal and other 
services through the same system, but when it comes to dividing 
the capital earned by the enterprise, they suddenly recall that 
a market mechanism exists and that something must go to their 
own pockets. Therefore, either the administrative state system 
-- then it is necessary to introduce regulation, standard 
freezing of prices, subsidies, and so on -- nothing so terrible, 
in principle. Or, as I prefer, a different platform: I believe 
that, today, we should not return to what, as we have seen from 
our own experience, leads to an inefficient economy. We must 
proceed to a market economy. We must proceed, in our deeds, 
from the interests of the individual and his family. 
  [Correspondent] There recently was a session of the 
presidium of the All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises. What 
plans were adopted there? Did the Ukrainian entrepreneurs reach 
an agreement? 
  [Babych] The All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises 
practically unites all unions, with the exception of three -- 
the unions of cooperators, joint ventures, and small 
enterprises. It took us a long time to think about the 
expedience of holding the congress, because everybody is sick 
and tired of political battles and reasoning, such as "let us 
protect ourselves more." However, the majority of the members 
of the presidium agreed that it was, after all, worth getting 
together in order to feel the atmosphere of approaches and views 
prevailing in the nonstate sector. At present, the executive 
management elaborates the organizational aspect of the matter. 
It will complete its work in the near future, and we will 
announce the date for holding the congress. Everything will 
proceed in a businesslike atmosphere. We will exchange ideas on 
a number of problems, especially those that presently give rise 
to differences, for example, about the contractual form of 
ownership: Is it worth supporting it further or is it 
temporary? Small enterprises require serious analysis. We will 
also discuss specific commercial and finance proposals on 
international cooperation and will familiarize the delegates to 
the congress with proposals on credit lines that are presently 
being elaborated. 
  [Correspondent] When [Mayor of St. Petersburg] Anatoliy 
Sobchak was a people's deputy of the USSR, he published a very 
interesting book with a quite symbolic title: "The Coming to 
Power." It may be firmly stated: You, Valeriy Heorhiyovych, 
are already in power. How do you understand power as a 
Ukrainian presidential candidate? 
  [Babych] I understand the concept of power as such that 
needs to be taken away from the president and the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Power should not continue just to come. If [koly] I 
become president, I will try to see to it that more powers are 
transferred to lower structures, where they must exist in order 
to protect the interests of the people and of the individual. 
  Today, leaders of farms, departments, and even ministers 
come to power and not to the management of an industry or of the 
country. Therefore, we must put an end to this "Coming to 
Power." The U.S. president does not come to power, but to the 
management of the state. In our country, superpower is 
concentrated in the hands of subjective individuals, who cannot 
always guarantee objective resolution of particular issues. No 
matter how hard they try, this will be a subjective approach. 
On the other hand, if a person comes to MANAGEMENT, the range 
of his influence upon resolving state and economic problems is 
narrowed, and he can influence and interfere in the national 
economic and, even more, in the state system by about 10-15 
percent. There are restrictions that must be urgently applied 
to superpower. 
  [Correspondent] There is presently much talk on strong 
executive power. What is your interpretation of this issue? 
  [Babych] I believe that in working on a decision, it is 
always necessary to consult others and not just once. At the 
same time, a single person must manage the country's economy. 
Just imagine: Three plant directors have been appointed at one 
go. Will there be an effect? In this case, everybody realizes 
that there will be no result. However, why are we applying such 
a model to the whole state and hoping to achieve positive 
results? There will be none! There must be one tough team that 
will work for one goal -- tough, but not in terms of methods, 
but in subordination and mutual subordination. It must be 
headed by a single commander who bears the entire responsibility 
for the team and who is ready to be answerable before the people 
for everything. 
  [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the fact that 
the former leadership set the minimal fixed capital required for 
registering small enterprises at 37 million karbovantsi [K], 
having thereby placed a barrier to their joining the business 
sphere? Will not this affect the activity of big business, 
which you represent? 
  [Babych] Small businesses must exist. This is why: They 
create a potential medium for, let us put it this way, the 
emergence of promising businessmen and entrepreneurs. In other 
words, it is a desirable medium, which must discover the talents 
and abilities of a certain circle of people who want to dedicate 
themselves to business, which is, incidentally, very difficult 
and not for everyone. Every person must decide for himself what 
he wants to be -- master, performer, owner, co-owner, or a 
simple state official. The state does not stimulate small 
businesses. The state does not stimulate anything. The fiscal 
system of taxes that is presently in use has practically led 
production and the sphere of services, not to mention small 
businesses, to an impasse. 
  My position and my program in this respect are clear: The 
first thing that needs to be done today is to fully stimulate 
the production activity of any person who wants to work, whether 
in the state or nonstate sector. We are obliged to welcome 
those people and those persons who want to work and create good 
conditions for them. 
  First of all, there must be a sensible taxation policy, 
including in the sphere of external economic activity. The 
Ministry of Finance, which continues to degrade, must finally 
realize that contributions to the budget must come from the 
circulating capital that circulates in commerce and in 
production. Turnover alone must contribute to the budget. At 
the same time, it is desirable to lower taxes imposed upon the 
population and upon production, and the state must stimulate 
what it needs. At present, in our country, when the question of 
Ukraine's survival is at stake, I would say, the policy of the 
stumbling-block approach prevails. 
  Some people say: Russia has much oil -- let us also urgently 
look for oil in our country. Let us look for diamonds and gold. 
This must be immediately stopped, and we must abandon the 
principle of raw-material development. Today, the only 
salvation for the country's survival and for ensuring economic 
stability is in the technological breakthrough. The state must 
give urgent support to science, to the implementation of 
technologies, and to the efficient utilization of production 
capacities. I was, for example, surprised when I read that 
Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] agreed to introduce preferential 
taxation for builders. Those who are again going to put 
something down the drain, have again obtained preferential terms 
for taxation. This is not right. It is only science, 
technology, and the creation of scientific hi-tech production 
complexes, where science works for achieving the end result -- 
the output of absolutely essential technology, equipment, 
machinery, and consumer goods -- which have the right to 
preferential terms. Then we will emerge at the appropriate 
level. Otherwise, we will always remain an appendage to anyone 
-- Poland or Hungary. It is ridiculous: Hungary is presently 
supplying us with meat and so on. The tax constriction and the 
credits and finance system stifle the producer both in the state 
and nonstate sectors. Unless serious measures in the opposite 
direction are taken, the noose will choke the commodity producer 
and we end up with food rationing.... 
  [Correspondent] How do you assess the course of market 
reforms in Ukraine? 
  [Babych] We have found ourselves on the verge of ruining 
market reforms. The world community is watching us very 
attentively. Those people who sit in their offices do not, 
perhaps, imagine the lightning speed with which Western 
investment, banking, financial, and governmental circles respond 
to the events in Ukraine. After Mr. Moroz was elected chairman 
of the Supreme Council, foreign investments through the 
Ukrainian Financial Groups were immediately suspended. There 
was one question: Please give a distinct definition: Is he a 
Socialist or a Communist? Restoration of planned economy? 
Following the election of the two deputy Supreme Council 
chairmen, the reaction was similar. Therefore, those people who 
sit in governmental offices and in the parliament do not even 
realize that the adoption of any decision must conform to the 
interests of the state and world community. We have become too 
important and independent people. We have failed to realize one 
thing: There is no such thing as pure independence in this 
world. Everything is integrated, whether we want it or not, into 
mutual economic and financial relations. This must be 
distinctly understood by our young parliament, which is yet to 
learn the experience of statehood, since the first period in its 
work resembled the approach usually exhibited by teams on the 
block: Let us create teams on our block and start pulling the 
rope in order to determine which team is stronger. I believe, 
however, that in two or three months, people will realize that 
they did not come to the parliament in order to stand up for the 
interests of regions, departments, or factions, but for 
resolving nationwide problems. I hope that by the end of the 
year, if the people do not disband us by that time, real state 
work will start, and every faction and every deputy will realize 
that he is responsible for the state, and not for a party or 
industry; that he is responsible for the 52 million people 
living on this territory. 
  [Correspondent] An idea is being considered of how to 
stabilize credits -- to grant them in a different form, via 
authorized banks. 
  [Babych] Still, I consider the problem of elaborating a 
distinct and efficient mechanism for repaying credits to be a 
major one. Why do many of our structures not receive credits 
abroad? Because there is no mechanism for their repayment. 
  Behind all of this, one can see maneuvers of the Cabinet of 
Ministers, which is trying to create a semblance of activity. 
There are borderlines for any Cabinet of Ministers and for any 
person, and they are incapable of overstepping them. I call it 
a barrier or a limit to human possibilities. In most cases, 
people themselves put them. In my life, I repeatedly broke that 
barrier. One needs to have vigor to overstep it. Our 
government is made up of generally good and normal people, but 
they have a limit to the possibilities of elaborating a 
decision. They must do one of two things: Either take one step 
forward and say that we must proceed along the road of the 
market and implement specific reforms or honestly give way to 
others, who are not afraid to do this very difficult job. It 
takes courage to make such a step. This applies to the 
parliament, president, and Cabinet of Ministers. Unless this is 
done, there will be an impasse zone, a dead zone. However, 
there is a hope that people capable of overstepping that 
borderline will come and they will know what is the main thing 
and what to do next. 
  [Correspondent] As a candidate for Ukrainian president, are 
you in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity or do you admit 
some variants? Do you see ways for resolving the Crimean 
problems? 
  [Babych] My approach to this problem is unambiguous. Once, 
when Ukraine was disassociating itself from the USSR, we 
welcomed that event. We also believed that we were doing the 
right thing when the community of the people populating Ukraine 
voted for life in a separate state. They believed that it was 
correct. I believe that the process of the disintegration of 
Russia and possibly also of Ukraine has not been halted. 
  With regard to the Crimea, I have the following approaches. 
I will say openly: I personally and a group of my specialists 
made proposals well in advance, proposals which anticipated the 
present development of events in the Crimea and we offered 
recommendations for what had to be done for the Crimea not to 
raise the question of seceding from Ukraine. In all cases, I 
put the economic factor above all. Politics is a greater 
economy and not the other way around. We are constantly being 
misled. Those old times when states were divided by wars, 
cudgels, and so on have passed. At present, states, markets, 
and territories are divided at the expense of economic 
decisions. Therefore, the Crimean problem should have been 
resolved earlier, one and a half or two years ago, through 
giving the Crimea economic incentives and tying it to Ukraine, 
so that it would have simply been disadvantageous for it to 
secede. This was not done. There were hopes that the new 
constitution and possible use of force would restrain the 
people, who might suddenly want to leave Ukraine. Consequently, 
if the majority of the population votes for the Crimea's 
secession from Ukraine, then, I am afraid, there may arise a 
situation in which the constitution and the will of the people 
residing in the Crimea will not conform to the mutual interests 
of not only Ukraine, but also of the world community. We will 
be confronted with the problem of the emergence of a new state 
on the territory of Europe. I would also like to stress: There 
is no need to stir up passions around this question. It is 
necessary to try and convince the Crimea, just like any partner 
or friend, that it would be economically unprofitable for it to 
sever ties with us, and to promote a transformation of mutual 
economic relations. Even now, it is still not too late to 
create such conditions of mutual understanding precisely on the 
economic platform, so that it would be worthwhile for the Crimea 
to remain within Ukraine and work together. In my opinion, any 
other approach will be fraught with negative phenomena to the 
point of a civil war. 
  My position with regard to territorial integrity is 
straightforward: Ukraine is indivisible. However, I repeat: 
When the people have voiced their will, one needs to proceed 
from the position of what the people want. When 90 percent of 
Ukraine's population voted for the secession from Russia, should 
there have been a war with Russia? If Russia failed to keep us 
within the Union economically and to prove the expediency of 
such union, then let us also treat other peoples' will in the 
same way. We must learn to convince people and not to break 
them. 
  [Correspondent] How serious is the outflow of capital from 
Ukraine to the Crimea? 
  [Babych] Such a problem exists. During one of the meetings 
with head of the government Mr. Zvyahilskyy, I also asked: What 
measures have been taken in response to [Crimean President] 
Meshkov's economic edicts? I understood that the government, 
the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank did not react to 
Meshkov's step in any way. Meshkov has a rather good team of 
professionals who have found an ideal method of knocking out 
from under Ukraine its economic and financial footstool, not 
even stool, but precisely the footstool, the last footstool 
being taken away from it. A thoroughly considered economic blow 
below the belt. A huge amount of capital flows away from 
Ukraine. It is time for our major leaders to realize that they 
must react in time to these or other actions. I can say that 
Meshkov has made a brilliant move, which is advantageous for 
him, but if we don't make a reciprocal move, no monetary mass at 
all will remain in Ukraine. What then? To take submachine guns 
and go and get what money is available? Such a development of 
events can be predicted, but I do not think that the National 
Bank has sufficient combat capabilities. Other methods and 
approaches are necessary here. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see Ukraine's National Bank 
[NBU]? Is is worth placing the NBU at the mercy of the 
parliament? 
  [Babych] I do not share the opinion of those who believe 
that the National Bank must be thrown to the mercy of the 
parliament or Cabinet of Ministers. The National Bank must be 
at the head of the state's financial system. It must receive a 
distinct set of regulations on mutual relations, in other words, 
a financial policy, from the legislative body -- the Supreme 
Council. All other problems must be resolved by it 
independently. It must have a priority in the economy -- a 
stabilization of the national currency. Everything else 
constitutes levers of the mechanism for implementing reforms in 
the economy. Therefore, any economic reform which intensifies 
the inflation process has no right to exist. We must 
consciously agree to a certain inflation process, but a specific 
one, through the National Bank. Enormous masses of coupons and 
capital have been frozen, but the people wait. Circulating 
capital is simply insufficient. It is consequently immediately 
necessary to stop financing those industries whose output is not 
in demand and goes to warehouses, and to help such enterprises 
to appraise the situation. Here, the main thing for the state 
is to stabilize its national currency. 
  [Correspondent] President of the Russian "Economic News 
Agency" Sergey Turanov telephoned the Press Center and said that 
they learned with interest that a Ukrainian entrepreneur, 
well-known in Russia, has become a candidate for the Ukrainian 
presidency. On behalf of the agency, Sergey Turanov asked us to 
put the following question: "How do you see the future of 
mutual economic relations between Ukraine and Russia, especially 
today?" 
  [Babych] Much has already been said about this. I very 
seldom change fundamental approaches, especially when I am 
convinced of their correctness. In 1991, prior to signing the 
state agreement between Russia and Ukraine, we signed, at our 
own initiative, an agreement between the entrepreneur circles of 
the two countries. There is also my signature under that 
document. At that time, I had to hear everything from our 
National Guard -- that I was selling Ukraine and so on. I never 
sold anything. I am not selling anything now. Even to global 
and nonglobal problems, my approach is only from the economic 
point of view. Any restriction of economic possibilities and 
slow circulation of capital are economically harmful. I am in 
favor of integrating maximum possible conditions for production, 
circulation of capital, finance, and so on. I can answer the 
question in the following way: I am against creating closed 
economic circles. There must be specialization and the division 
of labor on an international scale. All possible and impossible 
industries should not be concentrated on a single territory. 
  [Correspondent] If you become president, how do you see the 
struggle against the mafia and corruption? 
  [Babych] I will say clearly: It is necessary to combat this 
evil. However, we should not forget this: When we blame the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and other bodies which must 
struggle against this phenomenon, we must remember that under 
the uniform and under the shoulder boards there is a human being 
who has a family and who needs a normal salary so that he will 
not look for additional sources of income. We must approach all 
these processes from the point of view of the economy. It is 
necessary for all our structures to have, in their everyday 
activity, the interests of the people at the foreground. It is 
only with methods of the economy that we can fight the corrupt 
mafia. 
  [Correspondent] It is known that an edict on currency 
regulation is sitting on the president's desk. The Supreme 
Council has also prepared such a law. What is your point of 
view? 
  [Babych] Currency regulation is what must be done. However, 
it is not a panacea for rescuing the economy. I think that 
practically nothing will change over the next two or three 
weeks. I read that project. It is ineffective and will not 
introduce any cardinal changes into currency regulation. I 
believe that, unless a new premier is elected within the next 
two or three weeks, a premier who would have freedom of action, 
nothing will change. All the more so since all the rayon and 
oblast leaderships have now practically given up management of 
the economy, are only interested in their own election affairs, 
and are occupied with elections of deputies, mayors, and 
governors. Therefore, a month of anarchy is guaranteed for 
Ukraine. However, I hope that this anarchy will end on 26 June. 
  [Correspondent] If, in the stage of the presidential 
election campaign, President Kravchuk introduces the hryvnya, 
how will this affect Ukraine's economy? 
  [Babych] I consider introduction of the hryvnya, without 
three main preconditions, to be a political adventure, 
irrespective of who initiates this action -- the president, 
parliament, or some other persons. This would be yet another 
case of deception of the people. I have become convinced: In 
our country the state is the worst thief -- it robs the 
population particularly badly. I can prove this on any examples 
-- not once did the state turn out the pockets of the population. 
  Introduction of the hryvnya is only possible on three 
conditions. First, the creation of a stabilization fund and the 
unconditional arrest of the hyperinflation. Second, indexation 
of the funds held by the population, so that the people would be 
encouraged not to spend and not to get rid of the coupons mass. 
Third, a change in the financial and credit and taxation policy. 
  It is only under such conditions that we will be able to 
resolve the question of introducing the hryvnya. I have long 
been insisting on introducing the hryvnya, because the hryvnya 
will resolve many problems. If we do this, we will eliminate 
the so-called panic buying. Today, nobody -- not a single 
person -- wants to keep coupons. If we stop this process we will 
see how the market will become saturated, not like today, when 
some leaders boast that a stabilization in the economy has 
occurred as well as a stabilization of the market, although it 
is a different matter: Meat stays on the shelves not because 
the market is saturated, but because the people have no money to 
buy it. I reiterate that introduction of the hryvnya without 
ensuring these conditions is a political adventure. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see the future of atomic power 
engineering in Ukraine? 
  [Babych] I am not a professional for making far-reaching 
forecasts. However, I am sure that we will not abandon atomic 
power engineering, even though the shadow of Chernobyl is 
hanging above us. I was a member of the Governmental Commission 
for Eliminating the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe. 
Let us hope, with God's help, that this will never happen 
again. I will be able to give a more detailed answer to this 
question after I study additional information on the problems of 
power engineering. 
  [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward privatization 
in Ukraine? 
  [Babych] It is negative toward that privatization, which is 
presently under way. We have not prepared economic or financial 
mechanisms for implementing privatization. At present, the 
state structures responsible for privatization have grown so 
corrupt that commercial structures, in their development, did 
not even dream of anything like that. Enterprises are handed 
over to unworthy persons. You know where the problem here lies? 
To distribute "bricks" among everybody is not a problem. It is 
more difficult to make those "bricks" provide profits. This is 
a very big problem. When we say that privatization is a gift for 
the people, we are once again deceiving the people. 
  I am in favor of the joint-stock form of ownership. This 
form is more open and more accessible. It does not tie up every 
one of its owners to some "property." If a person obtains his 
part in the form of shares, he can sell them, exchange, or 
deposit. With our privatization we have again tied up the 
people to the "brick," and have not made them owners of anything 
real. For example, in Great Britain, over two years, 5 percent 
of state property was privatized. We for our part want to carry 
out privatization of 90 percent of property. This is not 
serious. We generally tend to run now to the left and now to 
the right. This is not the way to establish market relations. 
This is not a basis for establishing a market. This is not a 
basis for establishing private ownership, but yet another shady 
enterprise. In my opinion, the present privatization model must 
be revised. The process of privatization must be halted in 
order to prepare a normal financial and economic mechanism and 
only after that advance forward. 
  [Correspondent] Valeriy Heorhiyovych, speak louder, so that 
you would be HEARD. At the parliament. 
  [Babych] My voters in Western Donbass have heard me. I was 
a complete stranger when I came there and said: "My principle 
is to come to you as a stranger and leave as a friend." If the 
people believe that I am not a stranger, I will probably become 
a friend to them.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1645 GMT on 13 June broadcasts, as part of its 
pre-election programs, a 15-minute interview with presidential 
candidate Oleskandr Moroz by correspondent Borys Oliynyk. Due 
to a technical problem several minutes of this broadcast were 
lost at the beginning. 
  Borys Oliynyk asks Oleksandr Moroz to explain his economic 
program. Moroz replies: "With regard to the economy, when there 
will be normal authority and when this authority adopts a 
strategy of economic reforms that will be accepted by the 
people, then society may be consolidated and these problems may 
be resolved. In the last few days I worked with a group of 
scientists on such a strategy. It is called the basic 
directions of establishing a national economy of Ukraine. The 
main point is to make the economy work in the interests of the 
working individual--an honest individual who earns a living with 
his labor and his intellect. People understand that it is 
impossible to live like this because it is not fair." 
  Moroz goes on to expound on his economic program. He says 
these were stabilizing the money system, changing the credit 
policy in order to protect the producer, changing the country's 
import and export policies, and reforming the banking system. 
"It is important that relations between the state and the 
producer are fair and they should be built on economic laws so 
that the individual has the possibility of realizing his work, 
intellectual, and other potentials," adds Moroz. He goes on to 
say that the economy should be based on a "state regulated 
market." He criticized the present system which, he said, some 
people called reforms but really meant that Ukrainian goods were 
being sold abroad for pennies. One result of this was that hard 
currency was being stored abroad and this was a crime that 
should be stopped. He also criticizes the shortage of books in 
schools and advocated supporting Ukrainian culture and education 
through raising the profile of the intelligentsia. 
  Borys Oliynyk then asks Moroz to comment on the rising level 
of unemployment and organized crime. Moroz replies: "Much has 
to be done in order to bring order to the state. You were right 
in saying that one of the biggest concerns for people's honor 
was the turmoil, uncertainty, and even fear." He adds that in 
order to fight organized crime it is necessary to make use of 
the security service and some military formations, as well as 
the internal affairs bodies. 
  By way of conclusion, Oleksandr Moroz says that Ukraine 
should be a powerful state in the world community and that he 
would like the people of Ukraine to build a state with a society 
that was in a process of progressive development.

  [Text] It is necessary to create proper conditions for 
working people. As far as social protection is concerned, it 
should be provided to pensioners, children, invalids, and other 
sections of the population that need it. Presidential 
candidate, Ukraine's Minister of Education Petro Talanchuk was 
saying this while in Zhitomir. 
  He believes that it is necessary to carry out a wise policy 
of taxation and crediting, using all possible means so that 
people be paid properly for the work they do. Talanchuk pointed 
out that, if elected to the high post, he would, first and 
foremost, carry out transformations in the agro-industrial 
complex. According to the candidate, the countryside would 
provide Ukraine with ample quantities of food in two years time.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Savchenko: "I Will Sing Someone Else's Song"] </F>
  [Text] And so it is done. On 3 June the Crimean Government 
finally put its ministers in key posts--the Ministries of 
Administration of State Enterprises, Agriculture and Food, and 
Economics and Finance. For these positions the Supreme Council 
approved the previously acting ministers Anatoliy Franchuk, 
Serhiy Nikolskyy, Andrey Chernyavskyy, and Lyudmila Zaytseva. 
  This was preceded by long discussions on the draft law "On 
Making Changes and Additions to the Law of the Republic of 
Crimea and On the System of Central Organs of State Power of the 
Republic of Crimea." The work, which was essentially to have 
been completed in the commissions, spilled over into the plenary 
part of the session. With incredible stubbornness the deputies 
defended one or another ministry or state committee, wanting to 
expand the government at their own discretion, no matter what. 
Many of the deputies were concerned most of all by the fact 
that the government could turn into a closed type of society 
since the number of ministries and state committees would be 
limited. 
  Ultimately the document prepared by the Standing Commission 
of the Supreme Council on State Construction, Legislation, 
Legality, and Law and Order was adopted with corrections and 
additions. 
  We turn the floor over to the deputies: 
  V. Brodin: I voted for the law on making changes and 
additions to the law on the system of central organs of state 
power. We must make it possible for the government to function. 
And the fact that the document was not properly prepared is not 
its fault. The deputies should have been given both the 
structure and the personnel composition of the ministries and 
committees beforehand. In 14 days we will return to the 
document on the structure of the government. 
  L. Grach:There is a situation in which a polarization 
process, which will not submit to any kind of normal analysis, 
takes place in the parliament's work. Those who shouted the 
loudest and defended the Constitution were zealously flouting it 
today. Naturally, I voted against it. The entire national 
economy of the Crimea was signed away. This means that in three 
or four months we will have a lamentable condition in the 
Republic, and in this case responsibility for the state of 
affairs will be born by the parliament, which made it possible 
to flout the Constitution. 
  These are two mutually exclusive opinions we heard during 
the 
recess after the voting. And when the session continued it 
turned out that certain deputies still did not understand the 
entire essence of the document for which they had voted. This 
is what happens when there is confusion and haste. One must 
assume that in two weeks, although this is an extremely short 
amount of time, the session will again return to the question of 
the government, but this time with carefully prepared documents. 
  This meeting of the session revealed another extremely 
serious and unfavorable aspect: There is no mutual understanding 
between the legislative and executive powers. In order to push 
the government to adopt the decision, President Yu. Meshkov 
spoke repeatedly at the meeting. "A failure to solve the 
problem of the government will place the economy of the Crimea 
in an even more difficult position which could be characterized 
as catastrophic. And instead of accepting the government in the 
form in which it is functioning and can function and endlessly 
improving on the law on the government, you are putting us back 
where we started. Be consistent. If you are responsible to the 
voters, you should follow their orders." These words from the 
president convinced a large number of deputies and they 
supported him. 
  The time itself requires rapid, resolute measures. The more 
so since for several months nobody has actually been doing 
anything about the economy and economic activity in the 
Republic. The new Crimean Government, which undertook to 
correct the reforms, must see the deputies as allies who will 
evaluate it for its actual activity. The deputies, who have met 
the government halfway, must be consistent in their subsequent 
decisions as well.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko, </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 14 June TASS -- "The existence of a fixed 
currency exchange rate is one of the main reasons of the fall in 
production in Ukraine, which has gone down by 40 per cent during 
the past four months," Viktor Pinzenik, people's deputy, said 
during the Ukrainian parliament's session which opened today. 
According to former vice-prime minister for economic reforms, 
"two currency exchange rates are restraining exports and those 
industries which depend on imports." 
  As is known, as of today, according to Ukraine's national 
bank currency exchange rates, the U.S. dollar is equivalent to 
16,500 karbovanets, but the "black market" rate is over 45,000. 
"As a result, the national bank has sold only $75 million during 
March, less than a half of what was sold before the introduction 
of the fixed exchange rate," Viktor Pinzenik said. According to 
the deputy, currently exchange offices are selling as much 
currency as the whole system of the national bank. 
  Viktor Pinzenik told deputies that as a result of such a 
ratio of internal and world prices, exports have become 
unprofitable. He proposed to change the currency regulation act. 
  The parliamentary session intends to consider the currency 
question this week. Deputies plan to hear a government report 
on social and economic state in the country and a report on this 
issue prepared by the Supreme Soviet chairman. 
  The election of Ukraine's prime minister will constitute a 
problem. The majority of deputies think that it is inexpedient 
to change the head of the government before presidential 
elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Vasyl </F>
Ivanovych Yevtukhov by Anatoliy Kraslyanskyy; place and date not 
given: "Reform -- Not at the Price of Ruining Our Own Economy" 
  [Text] Our conversation with Vice Prime Minister Vasyl 
Yevtukhov started with the following question: As is known, 
there repeatedly sound reproaches in the press, as well as in 
official circles, to the effect that economic reforms in Ukraine 
are being implemented sluggishly, at any rate, slower than in 
neighboring countries. What is your opinion on the situation? 
  [Yevtukhov] True, such statements already set one's teeth on 
edge. However, let us first decide what we mean by the notion 
"reform." Even specialists are not infrequently confused here. 
This is what I will say: Some people reduce this notion to 
something primitive. If the state diminishes its influence on a 
certain branch or enterprise, which start floating with the 
stream, to some people this already looks like reform. Under 
reforms, I understand such management of economic processes as 
would ensure a rise in the efficiency of production and, in the 
final analysis, the people's well being. It is precisely from 
this formula that I proceed, even though there are many critics 
of this approach. 
  For some reason, there is an opinion, even shared by some 
economists, that reforms imply an intensive development of small 
businesses (of course, through a weakening of the state sector). 
Indeed, small businesses are a necessary element in reforming 
the economy. 
  However, they have no plans of investing money in long-term 
projects or in the program for the state's strategic development 
and are in no hurry to engage in science-intensive production or 
in the fulfillment of other important and promising state tasks 
-- for example, defense, social protection of the people, and so 
on. 
  Therefore, while implementing reforms, we should not ruin 
our 
own economy for the sake of privatizing at any price something 
that we do not infrequently observe in our state. Reforms 
require a sensible correlation between the state and private 
sectors, as this is done in advanced countries, and a cautious 
approach to privatizing strong and well-established enterprises, 
at the same time providing wide possibilities for the 
development of small businesses. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] However, Vasyl Ivanovych, Western experts 
particularly criticize us for the fact that state control over 
the economy allegedly hampers reforms and stifles the 
development of private businesses. 
  [Yevtukhov] Our economy needs to be reformed proceeding from 
common sense and should not blindly copy someone's models, which 
are in many cases not the best ones. In this, I support 
academician Pakhomov, who expounded a whole scheme of resistance 
on the part of various countries of the world to those reforms, 
which are based upon a strictly monetary approach and upon the 
thesis to the effect that "the less the state's interference, 
the more extensive the reforms." 
  Japan became an economically strong country despite, and not 
owing to, such an approach. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Singapore, Indonesia, and now also Malaysia have also rejected 
such a model. 
  [Ludwig] Erhard [FRG postwar economics minister], whom we 
often quote, started not just with monetary reform but also with 
directives. He restored "in a Soviet manner" the severed ties 
and set economic mechanisms into operation through directives. 
In postwar Germany, there existed planning on the macro-level. 
It was only after the situation started to take proper shape 
and the economic transition to the conditions of market 
regulation started that prices were liberated. 
  As you can see, the economy of the aforementioned countries 
developed under the control of the state in order to concentrate 
efforts and prevent chaos. 
  I believe, therefore, that the thesis "the less the state's 
interference, the more extensive the market" is erroneous and 
even harmful. It is more suitable for countries with weak 
industry, where this model restricts possibilities of ruination. 
  In our country, with its colossal economic potential, 
including missile construction and biotechnologies, such actions 
are very detrimental to the development of science, up-to-date 
technologies, or to the elaboration of fundamental projects. 
  I am stressing: I am against administrative interference 
into the work of enterprises, but I am in favor of discipline 
and well-considered actions in all links of the economy. 
  With your permission, I will once again turn to foreign 
experience. By the resolution of 1 December 1986, the principle 
of free prices was introduced in France (mind you, as late as 
1986!). However, this document allows the government to take 
measures in the case of excessively high prices or in situations 
created by extraordinary circumstances, including crisis ones. 
They make it possible to establish ties between the market 
economy and the economy of planned distribution and, on the one 
hand, to avoid social shocks and, on the other -- to protect the 
national producer. 
  I am convinced that we are currently in the transitional 
period from the strictly administrative command economic system 
to a market one. That is why it is necessary to chose 
"transitional" methods without extremes and take into account 
the experiences of other countries, which must be studied with a 
pencil in hand instead of taking for granted what newspapers and 
magazines write. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] At sessions of the Supreme Council, the 
government was repeatedly admonished for its failure to have a 
distinct plan for emerging from the crisis. Do you have your 
own vision of such a plan? 
  [Yevtukhov] The government has a plan. I also know what 
needs to be done in the sphere of which I am in charge. I am 
convinced, in particular, that we must start with establishing 
order in the banking and credits system concurrently with 
restructuring the economy. Today, as you know, the nonpayments, 
the absence of credits, the failure to pay wages, the decrease 
in the population's purchasing power (and also a slump in 
production, since an illusion of overproduction is created), and 
financial abuses painfully hit the economy. It is only 
stringent normative regulation of Ukraine's banking and finance 
systems that may today rescue us from total chaos in this sphere 
and in the entire economy. 
  The banking legislation in the United States envisages, for 
example, state regulation of the functions of the credits and 
finance system to a larger extent than of other types of 
entrepreneurship precisely because the character of banking 
operations has the greatest influence upon the material well 
being of a society or upon its moods. 
  The second, in my opinion, important problem is a 
reorganization of trade, primarily external trade and the 
related system of currency regulation in mutual settlements and 
control over currency receipts. Export today is becoming 
unprofitable due to the fixed rate of exchange of the 
karbovanets with regard to the dollar. 
  The third problem is a complex of measures associated with 
the encouragement of the national commodity producer. 
  [Kraslyanskyy] You, Vasyl Ivanovych, have come from the 
Supreme Council. How do you see, from your new positions, a 
cooperation between these high-level state structures? 
  [Yevtukhov] We are jointly doing common work, and it is 
necessary to proceed from this. Everyone must be in his own 
place and be answerable for what he has been authorized to do by 
the law and by the Constitution. 
  Undoubtedly, the Supreme Council, as the state's 
highest-level body, must control the government's activity, but 
not by way of demanding monthly reports after the return of the 
deputies from provinces, as was the case in the past. 
  I would like to stress that reforms will not advance (even 
if 
supervised by a new Erhard), unless the power vertical and 
control over the economy are restored. Here, the Supreme 
Council, as the highest legislative body, must assume the 
responsibility. 
  I see as optimal such cooperation in which the government, 
jointly with working structures of the Supreme Council, submits 
its plans for consideration, deputies thoroughly study them, 
analyze, and, if necessary, amend, and then ensure their 
implementation through legislation. 
  I am against any confrontation, ambitions, or populism and 
favor constructive work and logic of mutual persuasions. 
  In conclusion, I would like to say the following. Ukraine 
may be rich and strong. For this, it is necessary to work more 
and not whimper or give rise to hysteria about the crisis or 
various disasters. No one, except us, will extricate our 
country from the difficult period in its state development.

<F P=106> [Article by Ukrainian Environmental Protection Minister </F>
Yuriy Kostenko "specially for VYBIR"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament's decision to lift the 
moratorium on nuclear power engineering development and to 
continue operation of the Chernobyl NPP [nuclear power plant] 
has given rise to a number of important questions. The main 
question is: Was that decision scientifically grounded from 
economic and ecological points of view or will it lead to the 
situation when, in 10 years, we will have to build several 
"sarcophaguses" like the one we have in Chernobyl today? To 
answer this question, I will try to briefly analyze the state of 
affairs in our nuclear power industry and the prospects of its 
development in Ukraine and elsewhere. There are 14 nuclear 
power units in Ukraine which are located in five sites, 
involving 10 VVER-1000 reactors, two VVER-440 reactors, and two 
notorious RBMK-1000 reactors of Chernobyl type. As far as the 
unit number is concerned, Ukraine occupies the seventh place in 
the world and the fifth in Europe. As for the nuclear capacity, 
equalling 12,880 MW [megawatts], Ukraine exceeds Great Britain, 
being inferior in Europe only to France, Germany and Russia. 
Despite that, our country remains part of the once single 
nuclear power complex and cannot exist outside it. Having 
become an independent country, Ukraine had a unique opportunity 
to set up the state of the art nuclear safety system allowing 
for domestic and world experience. However, unwillingness of the 
Ukrainian officialdom to solve this problem in a comprehensive 
manner, also the pressure on the part of pronuclear 
parliamentarian lobby created the situation when today we have 
the same obsolete system of the bodies responsible for nuclear 
and radiation safety, the system that existed in the USSR. This 
fact, also inadequate industrial infrastructure and 
scientific-technological support prevent Ukraine to ensure 
adequate safety of its NPP's. On the other hand, almost 
complete dependence of this country on Russia in the NPP 
operation domain makes it possible for the latter to regulate 
the development of Ukrainian nuclear power industry in its own 
interests. This is very important for Russia today when there 
appear cardinal changes in its nuclear power complex 
characterized by drastic labor cuts and closure of nuclear 
industry enterprises as a result of reduction in financing of 
military nuclear programs. Given this, the Russian Government 
tries to reorient its nuclear industry to fulfillment of civil 
programs. This is proved by the latest decisions of the Russian 
Government on financing of construction of new NPP units. The 
Russian Nuclear Engineering Ministry is going to promote both 
Russian and Ukrainian nuclear power programs, to support the 
relevant decisions taken by the Ukrainian parliament involving 
continuation of Chernobyl NPP operation and completion of 
construction of six new VVER-1000 units. Why? Because such 
decisions help provide new orders for the Russian nuclear 
complex and said ministry. So, it is hard to answer for whom 
our NPP's work -- Ukraine or Russia? Ukraine boasts rich 
deposits of uranium. We also have zirconium, hafnium, niobium, 
other rare-earth elements required for nuclear fuel cycle. The 
Ukrainian plants produce "heavy water" as well. We have a 
powerful scientific potential. It is worth underscoring that 
the fulfillment of the Ukrainian nuclear program depends on 
solution of the following main problems: 

  -  Improvement of competitiveness of domestic nuclear 
industry; 
  -  Raising the nuclear safety to the level excluding the 
possibility of grave accidents at the Ukrainian NPP; 
  -  Safe 
handling of radioactive wastes. 

  It is more profitable for our NPP's to use not enriched but 
natural uranium. For instance, fuel cycle of the Canadian 
reactors of CANDU type, that utilize natural uranium, is much 
simpler, cheaper and ecologically safer versus that of VVER or 
RBMK reactors which employ enriched uranium. There is no need 
to enrich uranium while the waste fuel in such reactors has a 
very small number of fissionable isotopes thus facilitating 
solution of the fuel storage and burial problem. Besides, CANDU 
reactors can be used to burn the fuel from VVER reactors. 
Usually, service life of nuclear reactors is 30-40 years but, 
in fact, it is about 15-20 years taking into account the safety 
requirements. For instance, today in the world, some 80 
reactors, that had worked 17-20 years, have been removed from 
service. The nuclear boom of the 1960's has been replaced in 
many countries by a "terrible hangover" in the form of closure 
of quite a few NPP's. This involves the growth of relevant 
expenses and the problem of nuclear waste utilization. 
According to the State nuclear power committee, removal of 
Chernobyl NPP from service will cost $2 billion. If this is 
true, the idea of nuclear power engineering development in 
Ukraine becomes rather doubtful. In the NPP's with VVER-type 
reactors, steam generators should be replaced in 7-12 years. As 
regards the CANDU reactors, their horizontal fuel channels must 
be replaced in 11-12 years, not in 40 years as the reactor 
designers believed. The RBMK reactor requires full replacement 
of fuel channels after 20 years of operation. We annually spend 
10-15 percent of our budget to fight against Chernobyl 
aftermath. One should also take into account the huge 
contaminated area and Chernobyl hazardous effect on human 
health. Chernobyl proves that there exist certain critical 
economic and geographic dimensions when the accident of such 
scale is capable of ruining the country's economy. 
  NPP's heat discharges twice exceed those of ordinary heat 
and power stations since their heat cycle efficiency is 30 
percent versus 50 percent of heat and power stations. This fact 
and the necessity to use the closed water circulation systems 
require creation of big cooling water reservoirs near NPPs which 
change ecologic balance there. An example of this is location 
of the Zaporizhya NPP close to a heat and power station which 
enhanced the negative effect of sulfur oxide and nitrogen 
discharges. Situation with radioactive wastes in Ukraine is a 
real catastrophe. Huge amounts of such wastes were produced by 
Chernobyl. There are over 100 radioactive sources whose use in 
national economy is not controlled adequately, more than 70 
million cubic meters of wastes stored in mining industry dumps. 
Such wastes are used as the fuel for NPP's but, at the same 
time, they are a powerful source of environmental contamination. 
Most radioactive wastes are generated by NPP's. Experts warn 
that absence of adequate technologies and national centers for 
treatment and burials of such wastes prevents to ensure proper 
safety of NPP's. The problem is aggravated by absence of the 
state strategy and infrastructure for handling the wastes. 
Solution of such problems is the chief prerequisite for 
development of domestic nuclear power industry. First of all, 
it is necessary to define the notion of the waste nuclear fuel. 
Experts from some countries (Russia, Great Britain, France, 
China, Japan etc.) maintain that this notion includes such 
valuable materials as uranium, plutonium, isotopes and 
rare-earth elements. Other experts (Canada, Sweden, United 
States) regard this fuel as radioactive wastes. It is evident 
that in the first case it would be unprofitable for Ukraine to 
give such valuable [materials] to Russia free of charge. On the 
other hand, at any time, Russia may refuse to accept such 
materials from our country. Should this happen, we must 
construct our own temporary "dry" storages where the wastes may 
be kept from five to 120 years. Then we can start thinking 
about the ways of wastes utilization and burial. Our efforts 
today should be channeled to raising the NPP safety and wastes 
utilization. Urgent measures in this field include: 
replacement of Chernobyl reactors by more reliable and safe 
VVER-type reactors in Zaporizhya, Rivno and Khmelnytsky NPPs; 
construction of temporary storages for nuclear wastes; 
production of fuel assemblies by the Ukrainian enterprises that 
will help improve the NPP safety. All of us are responsible for 
"nuclear future" of Ukraine -- either it will be bright or 
covered with radioactive clouds.

94] 
  [Text] Since very painful and complicated negotiations in 
Kiev (see UBN No. 23/1994) and significant concessions on the 
part of Ukrgazprom, Russia's natural gas supplier, Gazprom, has 
continued its extra supplies, which allows Ukraine to pool 
enough natural gas to sustain Ukraine through the customarily 
dreaded fall-winter period, without restricting domestic 
consumption. 
  Under an earlier agreement Gazprom undertook to pipe 10 
billion cu. m. [cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukrainian 
underground storaging facilities located predominantly in West 
Ukraine. 
  A part of the above amount will be redeemed by Ukraine, 
though the bulk of natural gas stocks are supposed to secure 
stability of Russian exports to other nations, whose gas 
consumption will naturally grow in the fall-winter period. 
  Gazprom supplied 5,257.9 million cu. m. of natural gas 
within 
the 1-10 June period, which exceeded the target figure by 174.7 
million. 
  Within the same period, Turkmenistan piped 601.9 million cu. 
m. of natural gas to Ukraine, which also exceeded the agreed 
amount, by 90.2 million cu. m. 
  Ukraine's aggregate natural gas consumption during the very 
same period totalled 756.2 million cu. m., which allowed to save 
450 million cu. m. of natural gas and increase Ukrgazprom's 
underground-stored pool by 4,103.6 million cu. m. 
  If natural gas supply rates are maintained at their present 
magnitude, Ukrgazprom will be able to pool the necessary 25 to 
30 billion cu. m. reserve by the summer season's close.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Asuyev] </F>
  [Text] Groznyy, 13 Jun -- The armed groupings of Ruslan 
Labazanov and Khoza Suleymanov, which rose up against Dzhokhar 
Dudayev, have been almost completely crushed, the republic's 
Ministry of Internal Affairs told ITAR-TASS. 
  As has already been reported, these two powerful groupings, 
equipped not only with infantry weapons, but also with seven 
units of armor, sent their men into central Groznyy over the 
weekend, making a number of demands of the present Chechnya 
authorities. Lengthy talks were unproductive. Furthermore, on 
Sunday evening the insurgents shelled the building housing the 
National Security Department and tried to hold a rally on the 
city's central square. The authorities decided to eliminate the 
groups. 
  By 0400 this morning forces loyal to Dzhokhar Dudayev had 
blocked the insurgents in one of the rayons of Groznyy and, 
following a long battle involving the use of armor, took by 
storm the four four-floor buildings that the insurgents had 
occupied. 
  Eight government soldiers were killed, including Khamzat 
Khankarov, the commander of the Chechen formations that had been 
fighting in the conflict in Abkhazia. 
  The number of victims of the other side and among civilians 
is still unclear. Khoza Suleymanov, badly wounded, has been 
arrested. It is not known what has happened to Ruslan Labazanov. 
  Chechnya's law enforcement bodies are carrying out a search 
for remaining insurgents who have disappeared in the city and in 
the republic and who may commit individual acts of terrorism. 
  An emergency sitting of the Chechen Cabinet has been going 
on 
in Groznyy since this morning. 
  [Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at 1300 GMT on 13 
June 
adds: "The press service of the Chechen Interior Ministry has 
told ITAR-TASS that by 1200 local time the operation conducted 
by the forces of the Interior Ministry, the State Security 
Department, and the Special Purpose Detachments of the Chechen 
Armed Forces in the outskirts of Groznyy was completed."]

  [Text] Bishkek 14 June TASS -- "It's no ethnic Chernobyl 
(nuclear disaster) yet, but `peak hour'", thus President of 
Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] Asker Akayev graphically assessed the 
state of current migration process from the republic. Akayev 
intends to find a way out of the prevailing situation during his 
meeting today with representatives of the Slav diaspora in 
Kirghizia. 
  At present the republic's over four million population 
consists of 56.5 per cent native Kirghizs, but the people of 
Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian nationalities account for 
21.1 per cent. 
  Four years ago there were 905.4 thousand Russian-speaking 
people living in Kirghizia. Now this diaspora has shrunk to 
almost 170 thousand. The process of migration is gathering 
momentum everyday. 
  According to the president, this process can be stopped only 
by giving official status to the Russian language, and 
introducing duel citizenship. But both alternatives run 
contrary to the Constitution of Kirghizia. The republic's 
present parliament has more than once demonstrated that it does 
not intend to amend or change the fundamental law. How to find 
a compromise, stop migration, without arousing a wave of 
nationalism, this is what is causing the present "headache" to 
President Akayev.

<F P=106> [Speech by Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze on 25 May to </F>
commemorate the anniversary of Georgian independence; place not 
given: "Let Us Build a New Independent Democratic Georgia"] 
  [Text] The date 26 May has entered into 20th century 
Georgian history as the anniversary of national independence. 
For the Georgian people, this date represents the apogee of one 
of the great historical stages of the centuries-old 
national-liberation movement and, at the same time, is an 
eternal symbol of the restoration of the Georgian sovereign 
democratic republic and Georgian statehood. 
  On this day, Georgian statehood was restored. 
  Today, on this great anniversary, I congratulate all 
Georgia's citizens. 
  The Georgian nation has created one of the oldest 
civilizations in the world. The history of Georgian statehood 
goes back to time immemorial. Therefore, it was wholly logical 
that a new Georgian democratic state and a new Georgian 
constitution should be born and the renaissance of the Georgian 
soul firmly established at the end of the 20th century. 
  We are celebrating 26 May this year in a particular concrete 
historical situation. Different forces assess this situation in 
different ways. However, there is one truth that cannot be 
disputed: Today, we are at the stage of a critical development 
of a democratic state and society; more precisely, at the 
transitional stage from crisis to stability. 
  In this situation, in spite of the difference of views, the 
domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Georgia, 
Georgia's geopolitical location, and its role and significance 
in the Transcaucasus and the Caucasus, Near Asia, the Black Sea 
region, the CIS space, and throughout the whole world are being 
increasingly strengthened and improved. 
  Georgia is today a full-fledged member of the community of 
peoples of the world. 
  During the last two years, many historical trends have taken 
shape that correspond to the impulse of 26 May. Today, I would 
like to emphasize only some of these. 
  In the economic sphere, the process of dismantling 
the totalitarian economic system of reforms and establishing a 
market economy has become irreversible, a process that is being 
steadfastly implemented by the state system -- the Cabinet of 
Ministers, parliament, and local municipal bodies of power and 
administration. 
  A fundamental governmental anti-crisis program and social 
and 
economic development programs up to the year 2000 have been 
elaborated on the basis of an edict of the head of state. 
  Following the edict of the head of state and discussion on a 
wide scale, the national program for overcoming the crisis was 
approved by a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  This program was assessed positively by the IMF, the World 
Bank, the European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development], 
and many other international organizations that have promised us 
help in implementing it. 
  It is now important that the program is transformed into 
reality. 
  We believe that the formation of a market economy signifies 
faithfulness to the ideas of 26 May, the creation of a free 
autonomously functioning economy, and the basis for political, 
constitutional, and state independence. 
  The bodies of state power -- the government and parliament 
-- 
are implementing planned special measures in order to strengthen 
the exchange rate of the coupon and carry out financial and 
economic reforms in the banking system. 
  Unfortunately, inflation and hyperinflation and other 
negative factors are hindering the efficiency of economic 
reforms. 
  Taking into account historical genesis in the sphere of 
reforms, we have an extremely interesting picture. 
  Inflation and hyperinflation in 1918-21 [years of Georgian 
independence] undermined the economy of the first Georgian 
republic and its monetary unit, the boni. 
  Unfortunately, in our contemporary republic as well, the 
temporary monetary unit -- the coupon -- is having a difficult 
time; the paralysis of the economy is the principal reason for 
its devaluation. 
  It seems that it is not so easy to form a national currency, 
national finances, and a national economy. It was difficult at 
the beginning of the 20th century and is likewise difficult 
today at the end of this century. 
  However, the main thing is that we have the basis for social 
and political optimism. I am sure that, in a year's time, when 
an independent democratic Georgia will again be celebrating the 
national holiday of 26 May, we will be faced with a different 
picture in the national economy that will have already been 
considerably revived. 
  This will be facilitated by the implementation of a 
wide-scale anti-crisis national program, balancing the budget, 
financial reform, the creation of a state treasury, wide-scale 
privatization, the formation and development of small, medium, 
and large business, our alliance with the IMF, World Bank, 
European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development], CIS, and 
countries in the Black Sea basin, credits and investments and 
humanitarian aid from other international organizations, the 
United States, Germany, France, Ukraine, Russia, and many other 
countries, and other types of economic relations that are being 
formed on the basis of a market economy and the principles of 
international law. 
  The state and private sectors of the economy will exist in 
the transitional period, but both sectors will function only 
according to market principles; monopoly will be excluded and 
free competition and free enterprise and commerce will be firmly 
established. 
  These will be some of the principal directions of our 
economic strategy. 
  Taking into account the achievements of national and 
contemporary world civilization, political strategy 
and state reforms have been implemented during the last two 
years with a mixed degree of success and in the face of 
resistance, but always along a firm democratic course and 
inspired by the ideas of 26 May. 
  We frequently say that the contemporary Georgian republic is 
the successor of the first Georgian republic of 26 May 1918 and 
this thesis is correct. This political formula is manifested, 
first and foremost, in our devotion to the ideas in the 1921 
Constitution and to its essence. 
  The constitutional law on power and the 1921 Constitution 
are 
in force today. However, these two fundamental documents are 
unable to fill the "constitutional and legal vacuum." They 
require amending and improving, taking into account Georgia's 
dynamically changing internal and international situation and 
the achievements of national and world constitutionalism. 
  The interests of state construction and political strategy 
call for an improvement in the structure, functions, and 
activities of parliament, the government, ministries, 
departments, and central and local bodies of power. 
  New steps need to be taken in the branch of state reforms. 
  During the last two years, in accordance with the demands of 
democratization, constitutionalism, and the specific nature of 
the transitional period, parliament, the government, and local 
administrative structures have changed and all such changes that 
have been carried out have been based upon the interests of the 
people. 
  The Georgian Parliament is the symbol of 26 May, 
of national and state independence and freedom and 
democratization and no matter how difficult and complicated it 
may be to administer its activities, no matter what kind of 
crisis it involves, we have to tolerate and improve its 
activities. I firmly believe that the future path of the nation 
will run along the foundations of democratic development. 
  Parliament has adopted many laws. The market economy, a 
rule-of- law state, and a civic society are acquiring a solid 
legal base. 
  At the same time, all factions in parliament, the 
opposition, 
and the parliamentary majority or minority should be aware that 
national energy and intellect and the nation's ability and 
spiritual culture should not be wasted aimlessly; it should have 
more constructive pathos than it has today. 
  Unfortunately, the contemporary stage of parliamentary 
development, at times, assumes a destructive character; there 
are often confrontations and violations of regulations and 
parliamentary ethical norms. 
  There is no need for confrontation between different 
branches 
of the national movement and political duels between factions in 
which forbidden ploys are used. History assigns everyone and 
everything to his and its proper place. 
  We should make a distinction between the oral declaration of 
national statehood, on the one hand, and its real construction 
on the other. 
  It is necessary to implement constitutional reforms. 
  Let us begin by examining either the whole or parts of the 
draft constitution. 
  According to the new Constitution, a new parliament and a 
system of executive power will be created and judicial power and 
local municipal bodies of administration and power will be 
formed alongside legislative and executive power. 
  One of the main events during the last two years has 
been Georgia's entry into the CIS; the beginning of the 
building of new relations with Russia. 
  Joining the CIS is necessary for Georgia so that it can 
attain in reality precisely the ideals of 26 May. 
  Without joining the CIS, it is impossible to overcome 
the economic crisis and settle ethnic conflicts and restore the 
country's territorial integrity. Therefore, no matter how 
unpopular the adoption of this or that decision may be, if the 
necessity of its adoption has been scientifically substantiated, 
the state and the government should adopt such a decision and 
patiently explain to the people the correctness of that 
decision. This action is dictated by historical inevitability 
and national interests. 
  Joining the CIS does not mean in any way that we will be 
paying less attention to the development of relations with 
western countries, the United Nations, the IMF, CSCE, the 
European Union, the alliance of Black Sea countries, and other 
international organizations. 
  Our country is and will be an independent, national, and 
sovereign state. 
  The social sphere and the social protection of citizens is 
the most burning issue confronting our reality. 
  Man is the measure of everything. Man is the 
supreme philosophical and political value. This forms the very 
basis of our democracy and humanism. 
  Therefore, care for the individual necessitates the creation 
of a humane rule-of-law state and civic society and three basic 
directions form the cornerstone of our policy: a market 
economy, a rule-of-law state, and a contemporary civic society. 
  Democracy, freedom, sovereignty, and the supremacy of the 
Constitution and the law -- this is our path toward the future. 
  All this is being created for man; therefore, the protection 
of man's civil rights, including social rights, at the level of 
the demands of contemporary civilization, is our most important 
task. 
  Unfortunately, today, we have a budget that is not balanced 
and a catastrophic budget deficit. By covering the deficit with 
bank credits, we are causing a further deepening of the economic 
and financial crisis. 
  The appropriate social funds and a different environment 
providing effective infrastructures have not been created. 
  Therefore, it should be clear that the social protection of 
the population is greatly lacking. Alongside hundreds of 
thousands of unemployed, we have up to 300,000 refugees and 
displaced fellow countrymen. They need to be looked after and 
helped, but we do not have enough provisions and resources. 
  The humanitarian aid sent by our foreign friends is a factor 
of great significance, but it is impossible to live in constant 
hope of charity. There are also deficiencies in the 
distribution of this aid; we are implementing emergency measures 
to eradicate these. 
  Ninety percent of the republic's population is living below 
the poverty line. The coupon has almost lost the function of 
money and, in conditions of inflation and hyperinflation, wages, 
grants, and pensions suffice for only two or three days. The 
main thing now is to resolve the problem of the national 
currency, improve finances, emerge from the economic collapse, 
resolve the energy problem, be prepared for next winter, and 
provide the essential minimum for the population. It is 
precisely this that is our main concern. 
  Central and local authorities and administrative bodies 
have elaborated an extensive national security 
program that is acquiring a new content. This means not 
only maintaining a basic standard of living but also improving 
the quality of life in the future. 
  Today, however, at the present stage, it is necessary to 
overcome the danger of starvation and poverty and ensure that 
the population is provided with the minimum amount of consumer 
goods. 
  A new system of national security signifies that the nation, 
the state, and each citizen is provided with political, legal, 
economic, financial, demographic, ecological, military and many 
other types of protection. 
  Certain achievements have been attained in 
strengthening our defense capability, forming an army and navy 
and border and internal troops, and in their combat, 
professional, and moral training. 
  Georgia's defense capability has been considerably 
strengthened following its entry into the CIS. 
  The CIS and NATO member countries will help us in the 
creation of our Armed Forces. 
  At the present stage, the Ministry of Defense and the 
command 
nucleus of the Armed Forces have been changed and strengthened; 
the new cadres have been supplemented with general officers and 
an officer corps; conscription call-up is proceeding better; 
national military and naval academies have been opened; an 
experienced general has been appointed as new [defense] 
minister; a large part of the bandit armed formations have been 
disarmed and the disarming of other formations is continuing; a 
single modern army and navy are being created that will be 
subject to a single military doctrine and iron discipline, and 
directly subordinate to the defense minister and the commander 
in chief of the Armed Forces-head of state. 
  Not only the Army, Navy, and border troops but also the 
other 
power structures of the state are developing dynamically and 
growing in strength; the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the 
State Security Service are improving their activities and also 
the Ministry of Justice, the court, and the Procurator's Office 
that represent the strong backbone of state power. 
  The new Constitution will form a new system of power 
structures -- ministries and departments -- at a more democratic 
and civilized level; it will improve further their combat 
ability and efficiency. 
  Judicial power is being formed on the basis of the new 
Constitution. Judicial reform is being implemented. This will 
be a big step forward along the path of the division of power 
and the construction of democratic institutions. 
  As a result of the effective, comprehensive, and integrated 
functioning of power structures, it has been possible to prevent 
a wide-scale civil war, defuse to a certain degree the criminal 
situation, disarm criminal bands, and strengthen the struggle 
against such particularly dangerous crimes as murder, 
kidnapping, rape, theft, burglary, banditry, armed robbery, drug 
addiction, the drugs business, and so forth. 
  All of this does not have only legal and criminal 
significance. Stability creates the preconditions for attracting 
capital from abroad and its effective investment in the Georgian 
economy. This requirement is demanded of us by all serious 
businessmen, bankers, financiers, and investors in the world who 
are attracted to Georgia by favorable conditions that have 
already been created in legislation, a relatively cheap work 
force, completely unexploited resources, and a whole range of 
other factors. 
  From the point of view of adopting a new constitution, 
state- 
territorial organization, and economic development, the 
settlement of ethnic conflicts acquires vital importance, 
as does the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity. 
  During the last few months, many things have been done to 
settle the Abkhazian conflict by peaceful means. 
  One should point out the certain positive results of the 
bilateral Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations in Geneva and Moscow, 
the efforts of the UN and the Security Council, and the positive 
role played by the CIS, the Russian Federation, and a number of 
other states in resolving the Abkhazian conflict. We have seen 
a turning point and change in favor of Georgia's territorial 
integrity and the restoration of Georgian constitutional 
jurisdiction on territories that have been temporarily occupied. 
In the near future, there will be the first big flow of 
refugees and persecuted fellow countrymen returning to Abkhazia 
under the aegis of the United Nations and with the constructive 
participation of Russia. 
  CIS member states and the Russian Federation will fulfill an 
even more constructive role regarding this problem. 
  The so-called "South Ossetian" conflict in Shida Kartli 
[area 
of Georgia historically comprising six regions into which South 
Ossetia was reincorporated under its historical name of 
Samachablo by the government of ex-President Gamsakhurdia] needs 
to be resolved. Conditions have now been created for political 
and diplomatic activity; the Georgian-Ossetian conflict will 
definitely be resolved taking into account the interests of 
Georgians and Ossetians. 
  I would not say that the world today is divided into spheres 
of influence between the giants of the East and West, between 
the superpowers, but one thing is clear: When the sun shines, a 
shadow is nevertheless cast somewhere on the earth. This refers 
with specific logic to certain regions. 
  The signing of the large package of treaties on friendship 
and cooperation between Russia and Georgia during Batoni 
[Georgian polite form of address] Yeltsin's visit to Georgia was 
a great event. 
  I believe these are viable treaties as they contain the 
rational balance of interests of two independent sovereign 
countries. 
  We should improve our democracy and multiparty system and 
firmly establish the achievements of modern world party and 
political science in our party and political life. 
  Many political parties are playing a positive and 
constructive role in parliament, the parliamentary majority, the 
press, and radio and television while, on the other hand, there 
are many that are forming a destructive opposition and negative 
public opinion.... 
  New political parties and political movements have 
appeared on the scene and it is significant that one of these is 
the Union of Georgia's Citizens that is trying, through 
specific actions, to bring economic, social, and political 
stability to society, implement an anti-crisis program, 
correctly forecast the parameters of economic and social 
development, and actively participate in carrying out cardinal 
economic and social reforms. 
  The Union of [Georgia's] Citizens is a party that advocates 
reforms and this is stated in its policy document "Market 
Economy, Rule-of-Law State, Civic Society." 
  I agreed to become the chairman of this political movement 
precisely because it aims to implement radical reforms and the 
implementation of cardinal democratic reforms represents my 
political credo. 
  I also want to say here that I initiated [the ruling] that 
the chairman of parliament should not participate in 
parliamentary elections on behalf of any party. This was 
already correspondingly reflected in the rules of parliament. 
However, many things subsequently changed. Parliament adopted 
a law on state power that is already in force, the institute of 
the chairman of parliament-head of state was established, and 
the necessity arose of creating such a party that would form one 
of the supports of the government's state policy so that the 
head of state, when requiring full agreement and support, from 
the point of view of the consolidation of society, the country's 
salvation, and determining new domestic and foreign policy, 
would not find himself hanging in mid air, as they say. 
  At the same time, the Union of [Georgia's] Citizens favors 
close cooperation with all progressive political forces. 
  Today, 26 May, I want us to extend the hand of accord to one 
another. Our united efforts will bring greater benefit to 
Georgia than our separation from one another. 
  Let us be together; let us love our nation, language, 
motherland, and faith; let us love our fellow man and render the 
greatest service to mother Georgia. 
  This is a reliable criterium today for [gauging] service to 
one's country and patriotism. 
  The national state idea should unite and bond a society that 
has been dismembered into parties according to political ideas. 
  Today, as never before, we need the unity of people and 
power, mutual understanding between parties, parliament, the 
Cabinet of Ministers, and local authorities and administrative 
bodies and their support and the unification of a fractured 
national consciousness. 
  Democratic Georgia is the motherland not only of Georgians 
but also of people of all nationalities and faiths and all the 
republic's citizens. 
  The Republic of Georgia is concerned with protecting the 
language and cultural development of all peoples living on its 
territory and their political rights. 
  The motto of the sovereign Georgian state is: People should 
save culture and culture should save people. 
  We often say: Georgian culture is a unique phenomenon. 
Unfortunately, in conditions of a market economy, particularly 
in the transitional period, when there is hyperinflation and a 
growing budget deficit that is not being covered by reviving 
production but by loans taken by the government from the 
National Bank, the state does not have the means to grant big 
sums and subsidies to science, education, the arts, the press, 
radio, television, and culture in general. However, there is no 
other way; certain sums should nevertheless be found so that 
Georgian literature and arts, music, cinema, theater, painting, 
architecture, and all branches of material and spiritual culture 
can again blossom. 
  This is the immediate concern not only of the authorities 
but 
also of patrons, sponsors, large, medium, and small business, 
free entrepreneurs, farmers, traders, well-to-do compatriots, 
and representatives of national business; it is a subject of 
concern for the private and state sectors of the economy. 
  It is interesting that the Committee for the Salvation of 
Georgian Culture is doing effective work; international contacts 
in the scientific, cultural, and educational sphere should be 
extended. 
  We should utilize in every way the experience of countries 
that have an advanced market economy in the sphere of creating 
cultural funds. 
  We should save Georgian culture and science and education. 
The epoch of the spiritual revival of the Georgian nation -- a 
new renaissance -- should be established once more. 
  The state policy of reforms cannot be changed. This is the 
road to our salvation. Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, 
all ministries and departments, local bodies of power and 
administration, all city halls, sakrebulos [administrative 
boards], and all rayon and village gamgebeli [administrative 
board chiefs] should be reformist in their form, essence, and 
activities. 
  There is no alternative to the policy of reforms. 
  It is necessary that all regions and centers unite and form 
a 
cohesive whole on the basis of a single strategy and tactics and 
that there be a consolidation of people and power at all levels 
around the policy of reforms. 
  This year, on 26 May, the sovereign Republic of Georgia will 
hold a military parade and the newly-born national Army will be 
on view. This is the Army that has to protect Georgia's 
sovereignty, its borders, its freedom, and all its historical 
achievements. 
  The 26 May parade and celebration will be a state 
demonstration of the new Georgian forces that are undergoing 
organizational development. 
  Dear fellow countrymen! 
  I congratulate you on the great national holiday of 26 May 
and wish you health, happiness, and success. God give us hope! 
Tomorrow will be better than today. 
  God bless mother Georgia now and forever!

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 13, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas, in his traditional Monday interview to 
Lithuanian Radio, said that no major problems exist in 
Lithuanian-Russian relations. 
  Commenting on last week's two-day round of talks between the 
Lithuanian and Russian interstate teams in Vilnius, Brazauskas 
described as "too long" the break before the latest meeting. 
  The Lithuanian president expressed satisfaction over the 
results of the latest round of negotiations. The delegations 
have started taking concrete steps to solve the issue of 
compensation by Russia for the damage caused to Lithuania by the 
Soviet Union since 1940, according to Brazauskas. The 
Lithuanian Ministry of Economics has been obligated to form a 
working group to figure out the damage and to foresee a legal 
basis for claiming a compensation. 
  Progress in talks on the debt of the former Russian 
Vnesheconom Bank to Lithuania "also gives grounds for renewed 
hope," Brazauskas said. A few years ago the Vnesheconom Bank 
expropriated Lithuanian people's savings worth over 7 million 
dollars and almost 150 million dollars belonging to Lithuanian 
companies. 
  Speaking about unsettled problems, the Lithuanian president 
mentioned the issue of Russian transit over Lithuanian 
territory. Talks on the regulations for the transit of Russian 
passengers and cargo, expected to be finalized by Lithuanian 
negotiators soon, as well as on a visa regime for Russian 
citizens are to resume in the near future, according to 
Brazauskas. 
  "Of course, a lot of problems remain in the fields of 
energy, 
fishing and environment. So in the future both our negotiators 
and the Foreign Ministry will have enough work," said the 
Lithuanian president. 
  Brazauskas reiterated Lithuania's position that the military 
potential in the Kalinigrad enclave of Russia should be 
decreased and the region should be demilitarized eventually. "It 
is an ideal area for the development of economic relations," 
said the Lithuanian president.

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin, 
before departure for Blagoveshchensk by air, told journalists on 
Tuesday that an understanding to "link the convocation of an 
international conference and the application of possible 
stage-by-stage sanctions against North Korea" had been reached 
during his long conversation with President Clinton on Monday 
night. 
  Apart from discussing the North Korean nuclear issue, the 
two 
presidents also examined some aspects of Boris Yeltsin's likely 
official visit to America in autumn. "Judging by the prospective 
time-frame, the trip will turn out well. Besides, it is planned 
that I will deliver a programmatic address at the U.N. General 
Assembly", Yeltsin remarked. 
  In this connection, Yeltsin said that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher are to meet in Brussels on June 15-16 to specify 
details of the forthcoming visit. 
  As far as the tour of Blagoveshchensk and the Republic of 
Tuva is concerned, Yeltsin voiced hope that foreign investments 
would be drawn to those areas, primarily from China, Japan, 
North and South Korea. "This may help those regions in earnest," 
he emphasised.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- A telephone 
conversation took place today between Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  According to the report received by ITAR-TASS from the 
Russian president's press office, the presidents continued their 
discussion of the situation that has developed around the North 
Korean nuclear problem and possible steps for its political 
resolution. In connection with this, Boris Yeltsin and Bill 
Clinton exchanged opinions on the UN Security Council resolution 
that is being prepared, and which should give equal weight to 
the ideas of both possible sanctions and an international 
conference to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula. The 
presidents agreed to instruct Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and U.S Secretary of State Warren Christopher to 
continue close consultations on these issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov: "Stop, Ferry.... Russian </F>
Transit Through Lithuania Still a Problem in Relations Between 
the Two Countries"] 
  [Text] After a period of active contacts between Moscow 
and Vilnius which made it possible to conclude a number of 
long-term agreements and to withdraw Russian troops from 
Lithuania, an incomprehensible lull has set in. The main 
problem is still the final draft of the documents on the transit 
of passengers and freight through Lithuanian territory between 
Russia and its Kaliningrad Oblast. Russia handed over a draft 
agreement on this question to Lithuania six months ago, but to 
date has not received a reply from its partner in the talks. 
Vilnius's official reason for delaying making the necessary 
decisions is associated with the fact that the Sejm has not yet 
approved the regulations for the shipment of dangerous freight 
through Lithuanian territory. But in my view the belief of a 
certain section of official Vilnius circles that Russia is 
creating a military fist in Kaliningrad Oblast is a still more 
substantial obstacle. 
  "Imaginary" is how the problem of the Kaliningrad enclave's 
posing a military danger was described by Viktor Isakov, head of 
the Russian delegation at the talks with Lithuania. He stressed 
that this is the latest card in the political game being played 
by those who have no wish to improve Russian-Lithuanian 
relations. Nevertheless, the latest round of talks between the 
two countries' state delegations, which took place this week in 
Vilnius, did not yield any impressive results. Only two 
agreements were signed: on the principles of reciprocal banking 
settlements and on cooperation between the customs services.

  [Text] Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was 
operated on at Moscow's Central Clinic last Friday to grind his 
gall stone by ultrasound. As Interfax has learned, the surgery 
was performed on recommendations by the German specialists who 
examined Chernomyrdin at the Mainz University Clinic last week. 
  The operation is reported to have gone well, and doctors say 
it will take the patient a few days to recuperate. A government 
spokesman has reported that Chernomyrdin is due to be back at 
work from a short leave on June 16. 
  As has been reported the premier is scheduled to travel to 
the U.S. later this month to attend a session of the 
Russian-American commission which he co-chairs with U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore. On his way to the U.S., Chernomyrdin 
plans to stop over in Italy. 
  He underwent a similarly successful operation at a clinic 
last autumn. However, surgeons recommended that he be examined 
at a specialized clinic abroad. It was after that examination 
that repeated surgery was recommended.

  [Text] Kiev, 13 Jun -- The all-Ukrainian political union 
"State Independence of Ukraine" [DSU] has made public a 
statement. In order to guarantee peace and calm Ukraine, 
particularly in Crimea, the DSU demanded the following from the 
Supreme Council, the president, and Ukraine's leading power 
structures: 

  -  To return the status of Ukrainian oblast to Crimea, 
dissolve the Supreme Council of Crimea, and abolish the 
institution of the Crimean president; 
  -  To confirm that movable 
assets (combat ships and auxiliary vessels) and the 
infrastructure of the shore provision (ship repair yards, firing 
ranges, airports, and so on) remain the property of Ukraine; 
  -  To 
demand the relocation of the Black Sea Fleet personnel, which 
did not take the oath of allegiance to Ukraine, beyond Ukraine's 
borders. 

  In the event that the Black Sea Fleet does not relocate its 
army beyond the borders of Ukraine, to consider the Russian 
military contingents as occupational forces, and to demand that 
Ukraine's Defense Ministry adopt all measures to renew Ukrainian 
authority in Crimea," reads the DSU statement.

  [Text] Simferopol--At a session on 13 June, the presidium 
of the Crimean Supreme Council examined the activity of the 
Council's working group at the talks between the parliamentary 
delegations of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. Serhiy 
Nikulin, chairman of the commission on state-building, legality, 
and law and order, noted that they had reached a new level of 
mutual relations as a result of the third round of talks. 
  "The Ukrainian Supreme Council's full understanding of what 
is occurring has been observed. Ukraine has agreed to the 
proposal to set up an informational and legal base and admits 
the possibility of developing relations on a constitutional and 
a treaty basis," Nikulin stressed. A new group was set up for 
talks, and its powers were stipulated. 
  The issue of the activity of Ukraine's Internal Affairs 
Ministry in reorganizing Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry into 
the main internal affairs directorate of Crimea was also 
discussed. The presidium's resolution notes that "the 
reorganization of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry does not 
facilitate the stabilization of the situation on the peninsula" 
and that mutual relations between Ukraine's Internal Affairs 
Ministry and the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry 
have become somewhat more complicated. 
  Financing is being carried out in accordance with a new 
system. Funds for maintaining the militia come from the main 
internal affairs directorate of Crimea under Ukraine's Internal 
Affairs Ministry, and not from Crimea's Internal Affairs 
Ministry. It was decided to inform Ukraine's Supreme Council of 
the impermissibility of the actions of Ukraine's Internal 
Affairs Ministry, and also to examine the issue of the Crimean 
government allocating funds for maintaining the Republic's 
militia. 
  In connection with this, Mykhaylo Bakharyev, a member of the 
presidium, noted that "hooligans with general's shoulder boards 
spit at their own Ukrainian laws. Therefore, we should state 
this in the form of an ultimatum and not hold talks until they 
fulfill our demands." 
  It was proposed that the old excise duties that Yuriy 
Meshkov 
had introduced be restored, in order to make it possible to 
remove tension from the budget, to find funds to repay the debt 
to Ukraine, which amounts to 761.8 billion karbovantsi, and to 
finance the Republic of Crimea's Internal Affairs Ministry.

  [Text] Tbilisi, June 13. (SNARK) -- By-elections to the 
Georgian Parliament, which took place on June 12, passed with 
gross violation of the Law on Elections. Such declaration was 
made today by Vice-speaker of the Georgian Parliament Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili. He informed SNARK of the facts which put in 
question the legitimacy of the elections. The Chairman of one 
of the Electoral Commissions and his Assistant had to leave 
their places to save their lives. Serious collisions took place 
at some election districts, at two of them arms were used. The 
candidates began blaming each other in using military 
detachments to get additional votes. 
  Mr. Rcheulishvili said in the towns of Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku 
and Salendzhikha 60-65 per cent of all the voters took part in 
the elections, when in Rustavi - only 10 per cent. 
  "Presumably, the Central Electoral Committee will find 
illegal the results of the by-elections in the towns of Western 
Georgia", declared the Georgian Vice-speaker.

<F P=106> [Interview with Head of State Eduard Shevaradnadze by Nato </F>
Oniani; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Good morning. We are presenting the 
chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of state, Eduard 
Shevardnadze's radio interview. Batoni Eduard, Russian Defense 
Minister Grachev's visit to Tbilisi was apparently the past 
week's major event. Yet another concrete step was taken in the 
handling of the Abkhazian conflict. 
  Considering recent developments could you please give yet 
another answer to a question you have been asked before. How 
interested is Russia in the settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict, I mean the Russia that celebrated the day of the 
declaration of its sovereignty yesterday and has just begun to 
apprehend its sovereignty and independence? You have also 
answered the next question before but it is more interesting to 
hear an answer today: Could this kind of settlement of the 
Abkhazian issue cause irritation in the West and especially in 
the United States? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. With regard to 
Russian Defense Minister [Pavel] Grachev's visit to Georgia, you 
know that I highly appreciated it especially because apart from 
this visit there were two rather significant telephone 
conversations with the Russian president, one at the beginning 
of the visit and the other after it. As you know, Mr. Yeltsin 
has already issued a edict on the deployment of peace-keeping 
forces in Abkhazia. In our second telephone conversation he 
confirmed that by signing the document he showed his 
understanding of the seriousness of the obligations Russia and 
the CIS are taking in providing assistance pertaining to this 
mission. 
  The UN Security Council is to meet soon. Provided the 
Security Council passes a resolution on expanding the mandate of 
its observers to which Russia's consent already exists, we shall 
be seeing quite interesting developments. The very deployment 
of troops will be related to preliminary measures on 
mine-clearing on roads, crossroads, bridges, and simply in a 
certain area and this is rather a laborious and risky job. This 
work, I mean the deployment of the troops, will apparently begin 
on the 15th or 16th [month not stated]. 
  I have said that we are dealing with a very interesting 
case. 
Why? One on hand, we have the CIS and Russia's peace-keeping 
mission as a regular organization, and on the other hand, a 
powerful institute of UN observers and the [UN] Refugee 
Commissioner's office whose activities will constitute a 
significant factor. Thus, the CIS, the Russian troops with a 
peacekeeping mission, the international control, and a very 
important team from the Refugee Commissioner's office which will 
provide refugees returning to their homes with as much material 
and financial assistance as possible. 
  For a country in our situation, this is an optimum variant. 
I would say an optimum and, taking into consideration this 
factor, an interesting variant. 
  I had three substantial and rather lengthy talks with 
Grachev. We considered almost all aspects of our relations 
including the situation in Caucasia through the spectrum of 
Russia and Georgia. We considered the present situation in the 
Georgian armed forces and the situation in the Russian troops 
stationed in Georgia. I have to say that they are grateful to 
the population of Georgia and the authorities who created normal 
living and service conditions. We have also considered 
important issues of mutual relations, especially Russia's 
participation in the building of Georgian armed forces. You may 
be well aware that without that we will not be able to create 
our national army. 
  We have often emphasized that Russian-Georgian cooperation 
and mutual agreement by no means contradicts the interests of 
other countries. On the contrary, it is directed toward peace 
and stability in Caucasia and even a broader region. In my 
opinion, stability meets the interest of Georgia as well as 
Russia and other countries. This was the topic of my telephone 
conversations with Mr. Boris Yeltsin. These conversations were 
a logical continuation of positive moves in Russian-Georgian 
relations which started after the Russian president's visit to 
Tbilisi. 
  As for the final part of your question, I have already said 
that a unique pattern of the settlement of a conflict is being 
created. [passage omitted] We can see the cooperation, mutual 
understanding, and mutual respect of Russia, the CIS, the 
Western countries, Georgia's friends [words indistinct] 
including the United States. In the event the plan is 
implemented, I think this experience will acquire great 
significance for the future, for the settlement of other 
conflicts. 
  Speaking of irritation, I consider this unfounded. I was 
gravely concerned by symptoms of confrontation between the 
United States and Russia which were seen recently. Fortunately, 
the leaders of the two states demonstrated sufficient wisdom and 
prudence to prevent these symptoms from transforming into real 
confrontation. The situation is quite normal at the moment and 
these two great states act in an atmosphere of mutual 
understanding. The settlement of the Abkhazian conflict may 
become a model for the implementation of new international 
relations. To speak of changes in a post-cold-war period, this 
may become a concrete and very characteristic example of the 
cooperation of the international community in handling a 
conflict. I also pin great hopes on UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali [words indistinct] 
  [Oniani] Batoni Eduard, last Sunday could be described as a 
day of elections. Despite the fact that certain circles 
expected something extraordinary from the elections, they were 
held in a calm and normal atmosphere in Zugdidi, Chkhorotsku, 
and Tsalenjikha. On the other hand, there were certain excesses 
in Rustavi. Grave violations were observed. Unsealed boxes 
containing papers were brought to some polling stations. Armed 
units appeared in the city and they exerted pressure on voters 
and even on members of the electoral commission. The chairman 
and some members of the commission were forced to flee from 
Rustavi and arrived in Tbilisi. This abnormal situation was 
observed in Rustavi at about 1800. 
  [Shevardnadze] The elections in Samegrelo, with such an 
active participation of voters -- according to official reports 
over 60 percent of voters came to the polling stations [words 
indistinct] -- were a great success. I would like to thank the 
citizens, the authorities, the electoral commissions of Zugdidi, 
Chkhorotsku, and Tsalenjikha as well as the Committee for 
Emergency Situations in western Georgia. [passage omitted] I 
congratulate all the elected candidates. [passage omitted] 
  As for what happened in Rustavi, this is very regrettable. 
However, I am not pessimistic. This event could be considered 
as a lesson for the citizens of Rustavi as well as for all of 
Georgia. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, the day of elections 
turned out to be very difficult. I want to draw one conclusion 
from this case. I am saying this for everyone to hear and 
everyone should consider it for the future. When money and 
force govern elections, elections have nothing to do with 
democracy [words indistinct]. This must be taken into 
consideration by all parties, all political forces, and all who 
intend to participate in elections in the future. This must be 
remembered by all. [passage omitted] The citizens of Rustavi 
and the electoral commission will be able to look into the case 
and make the appropriate decisions. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] In your previous interview you said that materials 
about the illegal activities of political parties and officials 
would again be published in the press. Certain facts were made 
public last week, too. Now, if we draw certain conclusions from 
those and previous publications and assemble the links into a 
chain, the question of who will be next arises. This question 
arises also because the scale of corruption indicates that it is 
not only one or two people who are involved in this criminal 
activity. There are indications that the topic of a struggle 
against organized crime and corruption will be given priority at 
tomorrow's parliament session. Last week, your address to the 
parliament was made public. The address called for drafting 
laws and adopting measures to fight this kind of crime. 
  [Shevardnadze] I do not know what the parliament will 
discuss 
tomorrow but I would say that the publication of individual 
facts should be welcomed. [passage omitted] 
  The main point is to create a system of fighting against 
corruption. It is essential to ensure state control and 
coordination of the system, to create a legislature taking into 
account all the changes that have occurred in recent years. 
[passage omitted] 
  I appealed to parliament to expedite the drafting of laws 
and 
make decisions on the fight against crime, and I hope they will 
do it as they did with drafting economic laws whose effects and 
signs of implementation we can already see. [passage omitted] 
  [Oniani] Processes that have been under way in our republic 
lately are a cause for optimism. Several important documents 
have been issued. An idea has been initiated in Kutaisi in 
connection with strengthening the coupon. They have created 
their own methods. The edict regarding the savings bank is also 
of a great importance. You have already talked about this but I 
think there may be some news about that because the process has 
started. 
  [Shevardnadze] I am grateful that you brought this issue 
forward. I would like to express my ardent support for 
everything done in Kutaisi. This is an autonomous way of 
managing a city, its economic and financial spheres. [passage 
omitted] I issued a special edict which gives the Kutaisi 
leadership more rights and possibilities to make large-scale 
decisions on certain issues. I have to say that the Kutaisi 
authorities have interesting plans about how to make the coupon 
stronger, although some people might say that it seems very 
difficult to imagine how this can be done in an individual city. 
[passage omitted] 
  I also issued an edict granting the Tbilisi mayoralty 
expanded rights and I can already see how the city has changed. 
We can speak of the city's artistic and creative life and many 
other things and all these result from conferring the right to 
take an initiative to the local authorities. 
  Taking into account the slight easing of the situation, I 
can 
say that the time has come for bold experiments. In this 
connection I would like to thank you for reminding me of the 
issue of the savings bank. It is a great thing as an 
experiment. This was initiated by the president of the bank 
together with his colleagues. [passage omitted] What is the 
point [of the savings bank experiment]? The point is that 
banking is being transferred to a market economy. Depositors are 
becoming shareholders, or rather owners of the bank. When the 
bank's president suggested that the state should reduce its 
share to the minimum in favor of depositors, I agreed to the 
idea. In this case a depositor becomes not a simple shareholder 
but a serious owner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi June 12 -- Murman Omanidze, who was the 
foreign minister in the Zviad Gamsakhurdia government, has 
returned home after a two-year exile and is now taking part in 
the elections of a deputy to the parliament from the Rustavi 
constituency. The new deputy will replace Zhiuli Shartava, 
chairman of the council of ministers of the autonomous republic, 
who died a tragic death in Abkhazia. 
  At first nine candidates were vying for the seat in 
parliament. Later three candidates withdrew from the electoral 
campaign, and two of them urged the electors to vote for Murman 
Omanidze. 
  Omanidze, 56, is in perfect health. In younger years he 
actively practiced sports and got the title of master of sports 
for unarmed self-defence. Aside from it, he showed a special 
gift for business, when he was still a student of the law 
department of Tbilisi university. Now he is vice president and 
executive director of the joint Austrian-Finnish firm Stellar 
with the turnover of hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and 
tens of billions of roubles. 
  Once speaking at a press conference, Omanidze said that if 
he 
came to power, he would make Georgia into a flourishing country 
in two to three years. He, a wealthy man with numerous 
connections in the business circles of Russia and other 
countries and without nationalistic prejudices, is giving 
priority to economic interests. 
  According to reliable sources close to the Georgian 
leadership, if Murman Omanidze is elected deputy to the Georgian 
parliament, he may soon become prime minister of the republic.

  [Excerpts] Tallinn, June 11, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart 
Laar took a landslide victory Saturday in a vote for the 
chairmanship of Pro Patria, the senior party in Estonia's ruling 
coalition. Whether this also means that Laar will continue as 
prime minister and that the Pro Patria-led rightist coalition 
will remain in power becomes clear after the four other 
coalition parties have announced their position on the issue. 
[passage omitted] 
  Laar in remarks after his victory said that allegations 
about 
Pro Patria's dissolution or abandoning of the political scene 
didn't hold true and that "there is much more that unites us 
than what separates us." 
  Laar in an interview with BNS said the decision made by the 
party general meeting had been a clearer one than anybody could 
have expected. "How strong will Pro Patria come out of the 
crisis now depends on what we do next and whether or not the 
diversities within Pro Patria can be healed," he said. 
  It now hangs on the decision of Pro Patria's coalition 
partners whether or not Laar can also continue as prime minister. 
  The parliament's deputy chairman, National Independence 
Party's Tunne Kelam told BNS Pro Patria's coalition partners had 
never unconditionally demanded that Laar should leave, but added 
that Laar's remaining in office had to be agreed upon with his 
and the other three parties in the coalition. 
  The so-called "small coalition", or the ruling parties 
beside 
Pro Patria, earlier have said they would announce their prime 
minister candidate Monday. Laar's rival candidate in Saturday's 
vote, parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis has predicted that the 
legislative body will fail Laar in a confidence vote. 
  Also one of Laar's fiercest rivals, his Cabinet's recently 
resigned Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, told BNS Saturday that 
the future of the current government depended on what the small 
coalition was going to decide. But Kannik declined to predict 
the outcome of a possible parliamentary confidence vote. 
  Parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis, showing regret over entering 
the conflict, said the election outcome for him had been an 
unexpected one. "If it wasn't for the coalition partners' 
proposal, I maybe shouldn't have become active in the election 
of the party chairman," he said. 
  The parliament leader said he had his own way in politics 
that didn't include becoming a prime minister. He added that 
what he did had been aimed at resolving the government crisis 
and helping the party on its way toward the next elections. 
  Kaido Kama in comments on the election outcome said he 
considered a split in Pro Patria unlikely. "There are no major 
program-related diversities between different wings in Pro 
Patria," Kama said. But he added that Laar's re-election was no 
solution for problems inside the party. 
  Finance Minister Heiki Kranich said he will hold his promise 
and step down. Kranich already last month said he will resign 
if the party congress re-elects Laar as chairman. 
  Kama after the vote said that his anti-Laar party suffered a 
defeat because having been unable to bring enough members of the 
anti-Laar opposition to the congress. 
  Kama said it would have been possible to bring some hundred 
more anti-Laar Pro Patria members to the congress. 
  All rival candidates in their remarks to the meeting before 
the vote criticized Mart Laar for failures in his performance as 
prime minister. 
  Kama warned the Pro Patria members that the party can retain 
good relations with its partners in the ruling coalition only if 
a new prime minister from Pro Patria is appointed to office. 
Kama promised before the vote that he as party chairman would 
"correct Laar's biggest mistake and restore a united team," and 
act according to guidelines by the party general meeting. 
  Ulo Nugis in his remarks said Pro Patria's coalition 
partners 
wanted to have a new prime minister. 
  "I have more power at the moment than the ruling party, 
because I have the support of a great deal of the parliament and 
of the Estonian people. Therefore, I was out for nothing when 
running for chairmanship -- I just wanted to extend my helping 
hand (to Pro Patria)," Nugis said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, June 13, BNS -- Eesti Gaas, the company 
running the natural gas distribution networks in Estonia, and 
Russia's Gazprom concern have finished drafting a supply 
agreement for the next 10 years, Eesti Gaas Director General 
Aarne Saar said. 
  The two companies by now have agreed on the amount of supply 
and conditions of delivery, while talks are going on to find a 
formula for price calculation, Saar said. 
  Price calculation formulas based on heavy oil and heating 
oil 
prices at the Rotterdam stock exchange, as generally used in the 
West, are not suitable with respect to Russia because of a 
higher percentage of sulphur in gas from Russia, Saar explained. 
  Eesti Gaas and Gazprom expect to sign the agreement already 
in August or in September. 
  The Russian concern owns a 30-percent stake in Eesti Gaas. 
The Estonian Government holds 39 percent of the company's 
shares. Fifteen percent of the shares are to be sold in Estonia, 
and another 15 percent, to some western company. Negotiations 
with potential investors are under way, Saar added. 
  Eesti Gaas turned over 0.5 billion kroons last year. The 
company's share capital is 38.8 million kroons.

  [Excerpts] The Baltic Council of Ministers which was set up 
today should provide a firm basis for Baltic cooperation. Anne 
Osvet reports. 
  [Osvet] During the Baltic prime ministers' meeting in 
Tallinn 
today the foundations were laid, among other things, for yet 
another cooperation body. I asked for more clarification from 
Alar Olljum, deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. 
  [Begin Olljum recording] As of today, the Baltic Council of 
Ministers has been set up. [passage omitted] The agreement 
which was signed today by the prime ministers of the Baltic 
states is to regulate cooperation between the newly formed 
Baltic Council of Ministers and the Baltic Assembly. This has 
been a firm desire, with Baltic parliamentary deputies, who were 
(?promoting) it already last fall when a scheduled Baltic 
Assembly meeting took place here in Tallinn. It was again 
repeated in Jurmala in Latvia [words indistinct]. The prime 
ministers are to decide the directions for the actual 
cooperation but I think that (?it will be what was discussed 
before), with economic cooperation and cooperation on security 
matters forming the most important (?spheres). Added to this 
will be energy problems, border issues [words indistinct]; we 
will, for example, begin talks with Latvia on the sea border.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  Moscow June 15 TASS -- Russian newspapers report President 
Boris Yeltsin's arrival in the far eastern city of 
Blagoveshchensk, the results of the founding congress of 
Russia's Democratic Choice party, which was created on the basis 
of Russia's Choice movement headed by Yegor Gaydar, and comment 
on presidential decrees. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on Russia's Democratic Choice party 
congress: 
  "The choice has been made in favour of a party. This means 
that illusions about a broad democratic orientation in 
post-Soviet society in Russia are finally receding into the 
past". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject. 
  "The congress went off well but nevertheless Russia's 
Democratic Choice party did not manage to resolve all 
differencies in its ranks. It can be supposed that main 
struggle inside the party still lies ahead, since Russia's 
Democratic Choice party is an organisation with a strong 
Moscow-based centre and weak regions. However, the centre itself 
is not monolithic either". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article headlined "Russia's 
Foreign Policy" by First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Adamishin. The writer of the article expesses his ideas in 
connection with the newspaper's earlier published article 
"Strategy for Russia" ("theses of the council on foreign and 
defence policies". 
  Adamishin believes, in particular, that "when advocating 
rapprochement with the west, which of cardinal importance for 
Russia, one should do so not by belittling what divides us, for 
we run the risk of deceiving ourselves, but must have a 
realistic understanding of the fact that the change of course 
from confrontation to cooperation, which in itself is 
exceptionaly salutary for Russia, does not guarantee 
positive-to-Russia solutions to problems that are inevitably 
encountered in the pursuance of this course in practice." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev's tour of Yerevan, Tbilisi and Baku: 
  "Notwithstanding the lack of specific accords in Baku, the 
tour can be regarded as succesful. The present round of 
military diplomacy strengthens Russia's positions in the 
Transcaucasus". 
  PRAVDA carries an article about Yuriy Andropov, former KGB 
chief and subsequently the general secretary of the Soviet 
Communist Party Central Committee, on the strength of 
reminiscences by people from his entourage, who worked side by 
side with him for many years. 
  TRUD comments on presidential decrees signed last Friday: 
  "As we see it, the new decrees are quite topical and are 
designed to expedite the reform process. It is important that 
they begin to work, not remain on paper. Much in this respect 
will depend on the government's ability and purposefulness..." 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA analyses the presidenttial decree on 
allocations to Russia's social insurance fund: 
  "Presidential decree no.1,004 is certain to get on a list of 
inane deeds of Russian reformers. At the hardest time, the 
state leaves the work collectives at the mercy of fate, 
depriving them of last support". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on North Korea's decision to withdraw 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency: 
  "The seriousness of the situation that has arisen in view of 
the statement is also compounded by the fact that North Korea 
continues to equate possible U.N. sanctions agains itself with 
a declaration of war. It follows from the North Korean Foreign 
Minustry statement that an expansion of sanctions, would entail 
a wider scope of Pyongyang's 'protective measures'".

  [Text] Russia and the United States have decided to request 
a UN Security Council debate on convening an international 
conference on North Korea and sanctions against it. As is 
known, Pyongyang has announced its withdrawal from the nuclear 
nonproliferation accord. 
  An appropriate Russian-American agreement was reached by the 
presidents of the two countries in a telephone conversation 
Monday night. In an interview with Interfax at Moscow airport, 
before flying off to the Far East on Tuesday, Boris Yeltsin 
reported that he had a detailed discussion with Bill Clinton on 
the North Korea issue, which he described "as a very serious 
matter," and about a resolution being drafted by the UN 
Security Council in regard to North Korea's nuclear program. 
  As a Yeltsin's spokesman explained after the conversation, 
the resolution on North Korea being drafted by the UN Security 
Council "should express along equal lines the possibility of 
both sanctions and an international conference for a 
comprehensive solution to the problems of the Korean peninsula." 
  In Yeltsin's words, Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and his U.S. counterpart Warren Christopher are to meet in 
Brussels Wednesday-Thursday to scrutinize the issue. 
  He also revealed that the issue of his visit to the United 
States next September had been set for good in his conversation 
with Clinton. During that visit, he intends to make a speech at 
the UN General Assembly. A tentative date for the address, 
according to him, is September 25. 
  Asked whether Russia could sign an agreement on partnership 
with the European Council at an EC summit in Corfu, Yeltsin 
replied: "I have been informed that an agreement with the EC is 
basically prepared. This is no good. When I am told it's 
completely ready, then I'll go for sure." 
  Meanwhile, as Interfax has learned, a group assigned to 
prepare a trip for Yeltsin has already been to Corfu. It was 
led by the Protocol Service's Chief Vladimir Shevschenko. A 
team of Russian experts is going to that Greek island soon. 
  Speaking about his current working tour of the Amur Region 
and Tuva, Yeltsin noted that he intended to learn more about 
regional problems on the spot and added that, in his opinion, 
Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean investments could be highly 
instrumental for the economic advancement of those areas.

  [Text] Moscow, June 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia would agree to 
phased sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang seeks to 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said on Tuesday. 
  In an airport press conference prior to his departure for a 
local tour, Yeltsin said, "If North Korea tries to push ahead 
with its withdrawal from the NPT, Russia would convene an 
emergency international meeting and agree to phased sanctions 
against Pyongyang." 
  He said he had a telephone conversation with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton Monday on the North Korean nuclear question and 
Korean situation. 
  Russian televisions and radios reported that in their 
telephone talks, it was agreed that President Yeltsin would make 
an official visit to the United States in coming autumn. 
  One of the major topics of the Yeltsin-Clinton meeting would 
be the North Korean nuclear question in addition to the issue of 
bilateral economic cooperation, they said. 
  Meanwhile, an ITAR-TASS report said a senior Chinese Defense 
Ministry official on Monday gave a strong-worded message to Choe 
Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the North Korean People's 
Army, that North Korea should not depart from its being a 
non-nuclear country.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, President Yeltsin set out to the Amur 
Region and to Tuva (Russia's constituent republic in 
southeastern Siberia). On the eve of his departure, he was 
interviewed by Interfax corespondent Boris Grishchenko. 
  Speaking about the goals of his trip, Yeltsin said that both 
of these far-away regions were "historically ill-fated", because 
despite their enormous riches they still remained economically 
and socially backward. The numerous state programs drafted in 
the Soviet time failed to bring about the expected results, he 
said. 
  Yeltsin also noted that he did not intend to propose any 
programs. "I will take decisions on the spot," he said. "It's 
clear, however," he went on to say, "that this region is badly 
underfinanced. It is rich in gold, coal, oil and other mineral 
resources which can benefit the people. I hope, therefore, that 
my visit will help encourage foreign companies--Chinese, 
Japanese and Korean (the Republic of Korea - Interfax) to 
invest in the local economy." 
  He also announced that on Monday evening, he held lengthy 
telephone talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two 
presidents will urge the U.N. Security Council to hold an 
international conference on the North Korean nuclear problem and 
on international sanctions against that country. "This is an 
extremely serious issue," said Yeltsin. 
  The Russian president's press service circulated a press 
release on Tuesday which says that the U.N. Security Council is 
drafting a resolution on the North Korean nuclear problem. 
"Possible sanctions and the idea of holding an international 
conference on the comprehensive solution of the problems facing 
the Korean Peninsula must be equally reflected in this 
document," says the press release. 
  To quote Yeltsin, on Wednesday or Thursday, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will meet in Brussels to discuss the North Korean 
nuclear problem. 
  Yeltsin also said that he had accepted Clinton's invitation 
to visit the U.S. next September. While in the U.S. he is also 
planning to deliver a policy speech during the U.N General 
Assembly. "This is likely to happen on September 25," he said. 
  Speaking about the possibility of signing an agreement on 
partnership with the EC during the meeting of the European Union 
leaders in the island of Corfu, Yeltsin said: "I was told the 
agreement had been almost drafted. This is no good. I will go, 
when I'm told that the agreement is completely prepared." 
  According to Interfax sources, a group preparing Yeltsin's 
visit to Corfu, led by Chief of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol 
Department, has arrived in Corfu. A team of Russian experts is 
to fly out to Corfu soon. 
  Informed Moscow sources believe that during his trip to 
Siberia and the Far East Yeltsin will give his go-ahead to the 
construction of Russia's Far Eastern cosmodrome in the city of 
Svobodny-18 (the Amur Region). Yeltsin is expected to visit 
this city during his stay in Blagoveshchensk. 
  A spokesman for the Russian Military Space Forces told 
Interfax that a feasibility study was being carried out on 
commission from the Russian government. IF Note: Previously, 
Svobodny-18 accommodated a strategic missile division. The work 
to rebuild this facility and adjust it to small boosters Rokot 
and space modules for them has got underway. 
  Commander of the Russian Military Space Forces Vladimir 
Ivanov stated that the first rocket would be launched in 1996 
from one of the five silos saved after the disbandment of the 
division in accordance with the treaty on the limitation of 
strategic offensive weapons. 
  In the future, Svobodny-18 will accommodate a new launching 
complex for heavy boosters Angara-24. Compared to the Proton 
boosters currently in use, the Angara-24 boosters will have 
higher ecological standards and be able to carry heavier 
payloads.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solton from the "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] The Korean Foreign Ministry stated that Pyongyang 
would withdraw immediately from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA]. Station commentator Solton writes on it as 
follows: 
  The decision Pyongyang adopted means in fact that it would 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. The 
Foreign Ministry statement said that Korea will realize the 
nuclear plan independently from now on and that it will not 
allow the international inspectors to enter the nuclear 
facilities. 
  This is a dangerous decision that would bring about the 
gravest consequences. By closing the door to the international 
inspection team, Korea supports the suspicion that it either 
already has a nuclear weapon or intends to develop one. 
  The Korean leaders claim that their nuclear development is 
peaceful in nature. Then why does Pyongyang avoid international 
inspection and intimidate the world community? Why does 
Pyongyang warn that sanctions would mean merciless war, while 
daring to subject itself to sanctions? 
  This could be interpreted to be designed for internal 
purposes. At any rate, the situation on the Korean peninsula is 
aggravating, and this is causing serious worries for neighboring 
countries, including Russia. 
  The presidents of Russia and the United States discussed the 
issue over the telephone yesterday. President Yeltsin and 
President Clinton exchanged views about the resolution being 
prepared by the UN Security Council. Both the possible 
sanctions and the plan to call international meetings should be 
equally reflected in the resolution to ensure the security of 
the North and the South and to ensure the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  There is still enough time to overcome the dangerous 
situation ensuing from Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the 
IAEA by sheer political means rather than by resorting to 
sanctions. However, unless Pyongyang shows a good-intentioned, 
sincere attitude for the solution of the problem, it will be 
impossible to solve the problem without resorting to sanctions.

  [Text] [Announcer Yevgeniy Grachev] The main news drawing 
everyone's attention abroad is the statement by the Foreign 
Ministry of North Korea on the pullout of the DPRK from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The Agency monitors 
how the non- proliferation treaty is being observed. The 
statement was the subject of numerous telephone conversations 
between heads of states and governments. One such conversation 
took place between the Russian and U.S. Presidents. But the 
most interesting thing is that 24 hours after its statement on 
withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea has sent no official 
notification about it to anybody as yet. We have already 
reported this in our Mayak Panorama. And now the report has set 
us wondering how this situation has arisen. I would like to put 
this question to my colleague, observer Vladimir Pasko. 
  [Pasko] You know, Yevgeniy Tikhonovich, this is not the only 
puzzling thing. Having announced its withdrawal from the IAEA, 
Pyongyang let it be known at the same time that it had not yet 
left the non-proliferation treaty. I will remind you that last 
year during a very similar conflict with the IAEA over 
inspections, Pyongyang was so careless as to state that it 
intended to pull out of the treaty. But having seen what 
reaction that decision had provoked, Pyongyang realized that it 
had gone too far and backtracked, saying that it would suspend 
its decision. So, now it has confirmed that that formula 
continues [two-second break in transmission] without stepping 
over the line which must not be crossed. But at the same time 
it has been loudly stating that it would not allow any unjust 
inspections of its nuclear sites. 
  [Grachev] In other words, as I understand it, Pyongyang is 
now in limbo, as it were. It is both party to the treaty and 
yet it does not subscribe to it. 
  [Pasko] All this, in my view, is just a publicity game, what 
is more, it is a publicity stunt for the benefit of the 
domestic, North Korean audience, since these verbal histrionics 
will mislead nobody else. Representatives of the IAEA said that 
they believe North Korea to be party to the non-proliferation 
treaty, and that as this is the case it is obliged to abide by 
all the requirements which are imposed on it by the treaty, 
including inspection of its nuclear sites for collecting 
information about the North Korean nuclear program. Pyongyang 
is refusing to let the inspectors in, while the IAEA, because of 
the absence of the information, is refusing to confirm that 
North Korea is not engaged in developing nuclear weapons. 
  [Grachev] You know, judging by the publications which I have 
read, nothing is clear. 
  [Pasko] You know, the argument over inspection is 
nevertheless of fundamental importance. If Pyongyang triumphs 
in this argument, it will set a precedent for others to start 
refusing inspection, and yet the IAEA is the only body guarding 
the non-proliferation treaty. To undermine its authority is 
tantamount to sawing off the branch on which one is sitting. 
  [Grachev] Then the question is how the DPRK can be made to 
comply with the IAEA's demands. 
  [Pasko] You know, sanctions are not out of the question. But 
a number of countries believe that there is no rush here. 
Pyongyang has been cunningly playing on this. Curiously, the 
statement in question was made prior to the meeting of the 
Security Council which must discuss the report by the IAEA and 
its decisions to stop technical aid to the DPRK. It is possible 
that the Council will raise the issue of sanctions. In its 
statement, Pyongyang reduces the essence of the argument with 
the IAEA to the issue of inspection, implying that this is too 
trifling a crime for a punishment as severe as sanctions. 
  [Grachev] That is not a trifling matter. 
  [Pasko] Some think, whether you want it or not, that this 
behavior means that Pyongyang keeps the door ajar for dialogue. 
But one cannot help seeing that the bargaining campaign which 
Pyongyang whipped up around inspection is fundamentally 
impermissible. The non-proliferation treaty is not an object 
for bargaining or exploitation. It can only be observed, and 
observed without reservations. All games must be stopped, in my 
view, in the most determined way. 
  [Grachev] Absolutely. All this is connected with nuclear 
weapons. Of course, things are too serious to start political 
games, you will agree. But I nevertheless think that sanctions 
are not the only measure that can be taken by the Security 
Council. I think the proposal made recently by Moscow on 
convening an international conference on nuclear-free status for 
the Korean peninsula must not be forgotten. 
  [Pasko] Of course, this proposal cannot be ignored. But it 
must not be mixed up with the question of compliance with the 
treaty on implementation of the IAEA's requirements. North 
Korea says it is against the idea of its argument with the IAEA 
being resolved collectively. It demands talks solely with the 
United States [two- second break in transmission]. 
  [Grachev] Many believe that they [as heard] will be 
continued. We have received a report from Japan today from 
which it is clear that the temperature of the water is being 
sounded. How will Americans react to such proposals? The 
Americans have thus said nothing. But I would like to note that 
proposals by Moscow seem to have been adopted by Pyongyang in 
recent days. Nevertheless I would like to draw your attention 
to the following: The issue of the argument with the IAEA seems 
to be akin to that of a conference on nuclear-free status for 
the Korean peninsula. Nevertheless they are not the same. 
  [Pasko] Indeed, they are not the same. I would like to 
remind our listeners that this was an opinion of our observer 
Vladimir Pasko.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Golts report: "On the Brink of Sanctions Which </F>
Can Solve Little"] 
  [Text] The nuclear poker game begun by the DPRK leadership 
is nearing a climax. The stakes are close to as high as they 
can get: In response to attempts by inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to clarify just how 
much weapons-grade plutonium the DPRK has at its disposal, 
Pyongyang has stated that it is leaving this international 
organization. Foreign agencies also report the possibility of a 
"definitive" DPRK withdrawal from the nonproliferation treaty. 
Pyongyang has declared its intention "to implement its own 
nuclear program autonomously." 
  In these conditions, the question of international sanctions 
against North Korea, the need for which is defended by the 
United States, Japan, and South Korea, shifts to a practical 
level. Washington is already carrying out direct work on a draft 
resolution for the gradual introduction of these sanctions. In 
a telephone conversation, the presidents of Russia and the 
United States exchanged views on the resolution, in which both 
the idea of sanctions and the holding of a conference for a 
comprehensive solution to the problems of the Korean peninsula 
are expected to be reflected on an equal footing. 
  Meanwhile, through its own news agency, KCNA, Pyongyang 
declares: "Sanctions against our republic signify immediate 
war, and war is marciless." Four years ago, I was in this 
country. The North Korean military explained how they were 
preparing to repulse a threat from the South. They showed me 
underground bases where 1960's Soviet fighters were located. A 
fortified region set up near the demarcation line was a source 
of particular pride for them. It constituted a huge granite 
mountain, in which, by dint of incredible labors, galleries and 
caverns had been forged. It was in these that artillery and 
machine gun pockets were located. 
  Even at that time, it occurred to me that the horrors of the 
last war, the merciless bombings by American aviation, had not 
been forgotten in the DPRK. And they are preparing for another. 
Although this probably bears only a tangential relation to 
resisting a modern army. But now, whether you like it or not, 
all these preparations have to be taken seriously. At the very 
least in South Korea, where right now they are stressing that 
Pyongyang has accumulated the requisite reserves in its 
underground stockpiles and it has sufficiently combat ready 
Armed Forces. 
  All of which indicates that an extremely alarming situation 
is indeed taking shape on the Korean peninsula. The world 
community cannot allow any country to ignore the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime. However, the introduction of sanctions 
in this instance is no more effective than transforming the said 
granite mountain into an "unassailable fortress" which you can 
easily go right past. 
  As shown by recent practice of applying sanctions, be they 
against Yugoslavia or Libya, they produce any results except 
those desired. And I see no grounds to believe that they will 
be effective in respect of the DPRK. This country's foreign 
economic relations are negligible, and a deterioration in the 
population's living standards is by no means a factor which may 
cause problems for the North Korean leaders, especially in an 
atmosphere of heightened military hysteria. In principle, they 
will boil down to calling a halt to the transfer of currency 
into the DPRK from the Korean community in Japan, and to 
restrictions on the already less than extensive economic 
relations with Russia, should it support the sanctions. That 
China -- the DPRK's chief economic partner -- will join the 
sanctions is fairly unlikely. 
  But I suspect that the very ineffectiveness of sanctions, 
the fact that they bear an almost symbolic significance, suits 
those who started this risky game. I do not think that it is 
Pyongyang's real aim to create its own nuclear weaponry. There 
is something else which is more likely: This program is the 
North Korean leaders' bargaining chip with the world community, 
as a result of which they want guarantees that Western states, 
and above all the United States, acknowledge the DPRK for what 
it is, with all the "specific" peculiarities of this regime. So 
that it can exist in the future without experiencing pressure on 
the subject of, say, observing human rights. In this sense, 
sanctions which isolate the DPRK meet this same objective to a 
certain extent. The idea of the country as a besieged fortress 
gives the rulers far greater opportunities even than 
international recognition of the regime. 
  The United States' desire to introduce sanctions is also 
understandable. Washington has yet to have much success in 
strengthening its position in the role of chief guarantor of law 
and order in Asia (this was especially clear after the retreat 
in the dispute about most favored nation status in trade with 
China). The introduction of sanctions, especially accompanied by 
some kind of military preparations in response to Pyongyang's 
threats, provides an opportunity to show just who is defending 
the Asian states. 
  Things with Russia are more complex. It, of course, has no 
interest whatever in a violation of the nonproliferation regime 
or the appearance of new nuclear states, especially not right 
alongside it. On the other hand, it has equally little interest 
in whipping up military tension on its own borders. The 
introduction of sanctions will inevitably lead to this. 
(Incidentally, of the potential participants in the sanctions, 
Russia alone has an embassy in Pyongyang.) This is why Moscow 
is firmly promoting the idea of an international conference 
during which it would be possible to eradicate suspicion over 
the DPRK's nuclear program and to allow the latter to "save 
face" at the same time. 
  Admittedly, as the visit by the South Korean president 
shows, 
the main thing which our partners have latched onto from the 
Russian stance is the possibility of its acceding to the 
sanctions, and its reluctance to support the DPRK in the event 
of a deterioration in the situation. Until recently the idea of 
a conference has hung somewhere in the background. As a result, 
the world is on the brink of sanctions which can lead to nothing 
except fueling tension. 
  The nuclear poker game is nearing a climax. It is not 
impossible that, when the time comes to show the cards, somebody 
will simply lose their nerve. The trouble is that it is by no 
means a candelabrum which will be aimed at the head of the 
opponent....

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Ivanov under the general heading: "DPRK </F>
Leaves International Atomic Energy Agency Under Wise Leadership 
of Kim Il-song. In Preparation for World War III"] 
  [Text] New York -- Pentagon Chief William Perry made a 
gloomy forecast in the middle of April this year as he was 
touring South Korea: The DPRK "will be able in a few weeks to 
develop at least four atomic bombs" with all the attendant 
consequences. 
  A month later CIA analysts concluded that as of early June 
Pyongyang would have between one and two atomic bombs. 
  In a recent brief interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Thomas 
Hubbard, deputy assistant U.S. secretary of state for Asian 
affairs, said that North Korea "has stockpiled enough plutonium 
to develop at least one nuclear device, and this process is 
proceeding fairly rapidly." 
  Washington's concern at the state of affairs on the Korean 
peninsula is still growing. The nuclear reactor in the Korean 
village of Yongbyon, which was to act as a plant for the 
development of "a deterrent weapon," was unloaded very rapidly. 
It had been thought that it would take the DPRK several months 
to remove 8,000 radioactive fuel rods from the reactor given 
that it had just one transporter. 
  Today the situation is extremely delicate. On the one hand, 
Pyongyang is clearly resisting U.S. pressure. On the other, a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council -- China -- may not 
respond appropriately to pressure from Washington. 
  "Mr. Hubbard, under these conditions does it look as though 
Russia's idea of holding an international conference on Korea is 
the only way of settling the problem?" I asked the U.S. State 
Department representative. 
  "Needless to say, this suggestion cannot be entirely ruled 
out today. But, believe you me, there is no time to be lost."

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- "Nobody knows how the recent 
crisis over Sarajevo would end if it were not for the initiative 
of President Boris Yeltsin", Radovan Karadzic said on Tuesday 
regarding Russia's support for Bosnian Serbs. At a meeting with 
Andrey Kozyrev in the Russian Foreign Ministry he said the 
Russian people had been Serbs friends over centuries. 
  Radovan Karadzic arrived in Moscow to receive a literary 
prize named after Mikhail Sholokhov that was awarded to him by 
the Russian Writers Union. Karadzic said he intends to meet 
representatives of various political trends. He said he will 
never forget priority role of the Russian Government and Russian 
diplomacy in the quest for peaceful solution to the Bosnian 
conflict. He said Bosnian Serbs are aware of Russia's 
objectivity so they believe it will not be biased in the 
approach to the events in the region. 
  "It is very difficult to end the civil war. Not only the 
armies but also civilians are involved in hostilities", Karadzic 
said. "We are sick and tired of the crisis lasting for several 
years. We need peace in order to build a democratic society and 
free economy".

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sergey Dorenko; from the "Vesti" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] [Russian Foreign] Minister Kozyrev said today that 
to unilaterally lift the embargo on arms deliveries to Bosnia 
could lead to a world war. Previously, only Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy had made such a gloomy forecast about the Yugoslav 
crisis. 
  Kozyrev's sharp statement was prompted by the fact that only 
President Clinton's possible veto separates the United States 
from lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the Bosnian 
Muslims. The [U.S.] Congress and Senate have already voted to 
lift the embargo. If Minister Kozyrev obviously fears that the 
U.S. gesture may provoke a reciprocal decision from Russian 
legislators, his guest today -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic -- evidently expects just such a response from Russia. 
  [Begin recording] [Karadzic] There is no embargo [for the 
Muslims], they receive weapons every day, very good new weapons, 
and sometimes I think it might be better for the Serbs if 
America lifted the embargo on weapons because other countries 
might lift the embargo against the Serbs. 
  [Dorenko] Can you name specific channels? 
  [Karadzic] They have been receiving them by parachute drops; 
they have been receiving them from Croatian territory, and some 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] elements are also working with 
the Muslims. I cannot say that there are high-level orders, but 
the field commands make unlawful deals with the Muslims and they 
get some very good weapons and if they did not have them, the 
war would be over in several months. [end recording] 
  [Dorenko] I met with Radovan Karadzic in the Yugoslav 
ambassador's residence after he returned from a meeting with 
Kozyrev. Russia is insisting on a new meeting of the foreign 
ministers of countries interested in the Yugoslav events in 
order to advance a new plan for dividing up Bosnia. This plan 
is supported reluctantly today, even by the Bosnian Serbs, among 
others. 
  [Begin Karadzic recording] We have 64 percent of our 
territory, we now control 73 percent, and it would be very 
painful for us to agree to 49 percent. [sentence as heard] But 
if we get good quality territory, perhaps, we could discuss 
this. We shall see how things go in Geneva. [end recording] 
  [Dorenko] Karadzic is afraid that the least valuable 
territories will be palmed off on him. At tomorrow's meeting in 
London with his Western counterparts, Vitaliy Churkin, among 
others, will decide what lands should be given and to whom. 
  Vitaliy Churkin is once again playing the role of diplomatic 
ambulance. He did not find time, however, to receive Radovan 
Karadzic after their latest quarrel, when Churkin accused the 
Bosnian Serb leaders of treachery. 
  [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you still on bad terms with 
Churkin? 
  [Karadzic] No, I do not think we are on bad terms. The thing 
is that when dealing with the Gorazde crisis we failed to agree 
on one point, but we achieved great successes since we managed 
to solve the crisis around Sarajevo. And for this we are 
grateful to Churkin, who brought a letter from President 
Yeltsin. This was a real solution to the crisis. I think we 
will work very successfully with Mr. Churkin in the future, too. 
We are not enemies. We are friends; we understand him. 
Working together, one can quarrel only with a friend, not with 
an enemy. [end recording] 
  [Dorenko] Karadzic hoped to meet the president, but he is in 
Blagoveshchensk. He still counts on a meeting with [Prime 
Minister] Chernomyrdin, but it is uncertain if Chernomyrdin can 
deal with Serb affairs after his recent kidney stone operation, 
especially considering the fact that this time Karadzic came as 
a private individual at the invitation of Yuriy Bondarev 
[chairman of the Russian Writers' Union]. As always he speaks a 
lot about his affection for the Russian Government, but can be 
seen most often in the company of the Russian opposition. 
  [Begin recording] [Dorenko] Are you not afraid that your 
contacts with the opposition here may compromise you in the eyes 
of the Kremlin? 
  [Karadzic] Each Russian is very important to us. First of 
all, we are working with the government and we are very grateful 
to the government, but I believe that this is one and the same 
thing, it is Russia, Russian people. [end recording] 
  [Dorenko] One of the reasons Karadzic came to Moscow was to 
receive a literary prize for his poetry from the Writers' Union, 
and not from the Writers' Union which is for democrats but from 
the one which is its opposite. In addition to Karadzic, prizes 
will be given to the chairman of the prize commission, his 
deputy, and a member of the board. 
  Meanwhile, it is not only the future of Karadzic but, to 
even 
greater degree, of the Moscow authorities that is being decided 
in Washington today. If the U.S. Administration, despite the UN 
and Moscow, permits the airdrop of weapons to the Muslims, we 
shall be able to see how big an American pill Moscow can swallow 
without taking active anti-American actions. Only a little time 
ago it seemed that the most difficult thing in the Yugoslav 
question was pacifying Karadzic and the Bosnian Serbs and now 
here is the outcome: They are pacified, and the main danger for 
Moscow's position comes from Washington. 
  All the best to you.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- After his exceptionally 
long talks at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Radovan 
Karadzic told Yugoslav reporters that "the Serb side presented 
its standpoints. I am very satisfied with the way we were 
received." 
  The talks were "useful and held in a good atmosphere," 
Karadzic pointed out. In his opinion, Russian diplomacy has 
assumed "an objective and impartial position," presenting the 
Serb interests in the Contact Group in the same way. 
  According to Karadzic, the territorial division of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, based on the 51 to 49 percent ratio, is problematic 
for the Serb side, but could be discussed if the quality and 
quantity of the territory were taken into account. In this 
case, Karadzic said, the Serb side would demand a certain degree 
of quality, compact territory, and a possible exchange of 
territory by giving "quantity for quality". 
  In Karadzic's view, the international community is dominated 
by forces that favor peace. In his opinion, some circles in the 
United States have so far opposed peace and are making proposals 
that the Serbs obviously cannot accept. "We are hoping that the 
Contact Group will act differently this time, that it will not 
come up with a proposal that is totally unacceptable to the 
Serbs. We would have to reject such a proposal," Karadzic said. 
He stressed a need for good relations with the Russian side so 
it can convey to the Contact Group what the Serbs can or cannot 
accept. 
  Asked whether Russia could support some Serbian stands 
regarding the maps, Karadzic said: "Today there was a 
considerable degree of understanding for some sensitive spots on 
the map," referring primarily to Brcko, Posavina [north Bosnia], 
and west and east Bosnia -- or the Drina region. 
  We believe it is very important that the fact be taken into 
account that both states -- the Muslim-Croat federation and the 
Serb Republic -- must be able to survive in a political and 
communications sense as well as in every other sense, the 
president of the Serb Republic said in conclusion. 
  Radovan Karadzic is expected to have more talks and meetings 
in Moscow. Tomorrow, he will receive the "Mikhail Sholokhov 
Award" from Russia's Writers Union at a special ceremony.

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS--"If there were no initiative 
from President Boris Yeltsin, nobody knows how the war over 
Sarajevo would have ended," Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
said in Moscow today, speaking of support extended by Russia to 
Bosnian Serbs. During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, the Bosnian Serb leader called the Russian 
people "friends of the Serbs for centuries." 
  Karadzic, who arrived in Moscow for receiving Mikhail 
Sholokhov Literary Award conferred on him by the Writers' Union 
of Russia, said that he plans to meet with representatives of 
different political movements. At the same time the Serb 
politician emphasised that he does not intend to forget the 
important role played by the Russian Government and Russian 
diplomacy in the search for a peaceful solution to the Bosnian 
conflict. According to Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbs are aware of 
Russia's objective stand, and do not expect any one-sided or 
unbalanced approach to events in the region. 
  "It is very difficult to end the civil war, because not only 
armies, but civilians are also involved in combat actions," 
Karadzic said. "We are getting tired of the crisis which 
continues for several years. We need peace, so as to construct 
a democratic society and a free economy," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- Russia is prepared in the near 
future to sign a framework document of the Partnership for Peace 
initiative together with a program of full-scale cooperation 
with NATO. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this here today 
by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the conclusion of 
talks with Mikhail Popov, his Moldovan counterpart. From 
Moscow's point of view, the Russian minister added, as far as 
deciding this particular question was concerned, it might be a 
matter of days, or even hours, rather than weeks. 
  Now, said Kozyrev, everything depends on how fast we receive 
a reply signal from Brussels to activate both the framework 
document and the Russia-NATO program, whose main principles were 
presented to the NATO leadership by Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev. According to Kozyrev, the program of cooperation 
with NATO is a very full of documents, which reflects Russia's 
importance in international affairs and the specific nature of 
its relations with the NATO, "without any mutual vetoes or 
surprises." 
  The Moldovan minister told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
his country, which signed the framework document in March of 
this year, also plans to submit to NATO in the near future a 
program of individual cooperation. Talking about the advantages 
Moldova will gain from participating in the Partnership for 
Peace programme, Popov noted in particular that if the republic 
finds itself under threat from outside, it will be able to hold 
consultations with NATO the in the interest of strengthening 
stability and national security.

  [Text] Moscow realizes the basic necessity to withdraw 
Russia's 14th Army from Moldova. There is no need to 
procrastinate this process, said Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
on Tuesday, upon conclusion of talks with his Moldovan 
counterpart, Mikhail Popov. 
  In answer to a question from Interfax Kozyrev said: "Russia 
clearly understands that there must be no foreign troops in a 
sovereign state. However it's not easy to prepare an organized 
withdrawal of the 14th Army. This process will take time." 
  According to him, "it's useless to speak about serious 
differences in the two sides' approaches to the times of 
withdrawal." "Both Russia and Moldova realize perfectly well the 
complexity of this issue, to which neither side has a clear 
answer. It's gratifying that no one has tried to tackle this 
problem unilaterally," Kozyrev noted. 
  For his part, Popov said that the presence of the 14th Army 
in Trans-Dniestria [Transdniester] is "the most inconvenient 
part of the Soviet legacy in relations between Russia and 
Moldova." "We do not blame Russia for the resulting situation," 
he stressed. 
  The head of Moldovan diplomacy said he hopes that the 
concrete times of withdrawal will be agreed upon during the next 
round of bilateral talks planned for July.

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- The president of Russia on 
Tuesday took a decision on the start of a peacekeeping operation 
in Abkhazia, Colonel-General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy 
minister of defence, has announced at a press conference. 
Kondratyev has been entrusted with an overall supervision of an 
operation to bring a peacekeeping force to the region of 
Georgian- Abkhazian conflict. 
  A peacekeeping force is to be brought to the region under an 
an agreement, signed in Moscow on may 14, this year, by the 
conflicting sides with the mediation of Russia. Georgia's and 
Abkhazia's final consent to the introduction of a peacekeeping 
force was obtained as a result of Russian Defence Minister Pavel 
Grachev's recent trip to the Transcaucasus. 
  Kondratyev explained that in line with President Yeltsin's 
decree on Russia's participation in a peacekeeping operation in 
the area of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the mission will be 
started by Russian units stationed in the Transcaucasus, the 
345th Paratroop Regiment, deployed at Gudauta, in particular. 
The regiment had participated in peacekeeping activities 
earlier. The start of a peacekeeping operation at such a 
strength does not require consent from the Federation Council. 
  The Russian Defence Ministry's operations group, led by 
General Kondratyev, is due to leave Moscow for the conflict area 
on Tuesday with a view to reconnoitering at the places of the 
introduction of a peace-making force and command post locations. 
  The peacemaking operation will be carried out in three 
stages. Combat engineer units are to be brought in during the 
first stage from June 15 to 21 for mine-clearing operations. 
Communications and control facilities are to be airlifted to 
set up the peacekeeping force's main headquarters in Sukhumi. 
  Headquarters are also to be set up in the western zone at 
Gali and in the eastern one in Zugdidi. At the same time one 
battalion from the regiment and two from the Russian group of 
forces in the Transcaucasus will be getting ready to enter the 
conflict zone on a peace-making mission. They are to enter the 
disengagement area from June 16 to 19 and take up combat 
positions at the disengagement line on both banks of Inguri 
river. 
  The second stage will begin after the presidential decree to 
this effect is considered at a Federation Council meeting which 
is scheduled for June 21. Those present are expected to be 
addressed by Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev as President 
Yeltsin's special representative in charge of the consideration 
of the matter. 
  In the event of a positive decision by the parliament, the 
Russian peace-making force in the region will be reinforced by 
two battalions from among the peacekeeping divisions from 
Leningrad and Volga military districts. The peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia is to be arranged in full by June 26. It 
will be carried out in close coordination and cooperation with 
the U.N. mission in Georgia. 
  On the whole, the peacekeeping operation is to involve about 
2,500 Russian peacekeepers on a purely voluntary basis and with 
contracts signed. 
  Kondratyev pointed out that the Defence Ministry's 
peacekeeping operation must be financed as a separate item 
outside the military budget. Last year the Defence Ministry 
spent 26,000 million roubles for peacekeeping actions. 
  The deployment of a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia, 
according 
to preliminary estimates, will cost Russia 2,000 million roubles. 
  Kondratyev did not rule it out that officers from Ukraine, 
Belarus, and Kazakhstan may join the peacekeeping operation at 
the second stage as observers.

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] A group of generals and officers of the Russian 
Defense Ministry headed by Deputy Defense Minister Colonel 
General Georgiy Kondratyev departed for Abkhazia on 14 June. 
The group is to oversee the beginning of the peacekeeping 
operation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. Slavyanka's 
correspondent Vladimir Orlov is among the delegation. He 
managed to have an interview with Georgiy Kondratyev just before 
take-off. 
  According to the deputy defense minister, the beginning of 
the peacekeeping operation is divided into two stages. The 
first stage will take place on 16-19 June. During this stage 
the engineer subunits will be deployed to carry out mine 
clearance operations in the region of the conflict. 
Communications equipment will also be installed and 
headquarters set up for the peacekeeping forces. There will be 
two such headquarters -- in Gali and Zugdidi. 
  During the first stage three battalions of the Russian 
Transcaucasian troops and the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment 
stationed in Gudauta are to be deployed. The peacekeeping 
forces' subunits will occupy disengagement lines along the 
Inguri riverbank. 
  The second stage will take place during 21-24 June. During 
this stage the number of peacekeeping troops in the conflict 
zone will be increased by two more battalions. The full-scale 
peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia will begin on 26 June. 
  Colonel General Kondratyev noted that the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry will have to bear all the costs of the 
peacekeeping operation, which will be about 2 billion rubles. 
He also noted that in 1993 the Russian Defense Ministry spent 
more than 26 billion rubles out of its own budget on 
peacekeeping operations. 
  To the question on the composition of the peacekeeping 
forces, Georgiy Kondratyev replied that only the Russian 
subunits will be involved. The CIS countries will be 
represented only by observers from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 
Ukraine. To our correspondent's question on who will be 
appointed commander of the CIS peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia, 
Kondratyev replied that this decision will be made on site.

Regiment started clearning mines from territory in Abkhazia's 
Galskiy [Gali] Rayon.

perdiod from 16 to 21 June after the mines have been cleared 
from the territory. 
  He said the batallion of the 345th Airborne Regiment, which

noted, the combatant sides should start pulling back their armed 
formations 12 km from the river.

few months. 
  "We presume that Russia might become a member of the 
European 
Council within the next six months, and not later than next 
spring", Galina Sidorova, a spokeswoman for Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, told reporters on Tuesday. 
  According to Sidorova, earlier, Russia's entering the EC was

European Council", she said.

  [Text] At the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow today, the first 
roundtable was held under the aegis of the Russian Unity and 
Accord party. Participating were representatives of the 
administrations of the CIS countries, politicians, and 
diplomats. The prospects for Eurasian integration were the 
subject of discussion. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey 
Shakhray stressed that the time had come to think about making 
the CIS into a confederation of an EEC type. That would not 
mean the reinstatement of the former USSR. In the EAU--short 
for Euro-Asian union--every state will be sovereign and 
independent. However, there is an obstacle in the way, Shakhray 
said; this is the continuing rise of nationalism in the 
countries of the CIS, including Great Russian nationalism. He 
said the key to solving the problem is the establishment of 
genuine federalism and local self-administration. 
  Marat Shizhirin, deputy head of the Kazakh president's 
administration, spoke about the mechanisms for the formation of 
the EAU today. In order to enter the EAU, it will be necessary 
to hold a referendum or to adopt a decision at the level of a 
country's parliament. At the same time, the alliance will not 
allow associate membership. The observation of interstate 
agreements will be an absolute part of the EAU code. The 
territorial integrity of the member states of the alliance will 
be rigidly observed. The main condition for membership in the 
EAU is the halting of combat actions. All this will create a 
new impetus for rapprochement of the former USSR's republics, 
both from a political and economic point of view, the speakers 
said.

round-table discussion in Moscow today Russian Vice Premier 
Sergey Shakhray highly appraised the initiative on establishment

Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  Shakhray said that the matter was not whether to unite or 
not

  Shakhray stressed that integration must be carried out in a 
civilized way, equitably and voluntarily, preserving the 
political sovereignty of the countries involved. Otherwise, he 
said, the result could be the use of force. 
  Shakhray said that the issue of uniting and restoring 
economic and other ties was now a factor of political stability 
in all CIS states, including Russia. 
  "The forms and the title of the new integration can vary," 
Shakhray said. He added that the CIS will be becoming more and 
more efficient and friendship with Russia will be the victor at 
the presidential elections in Belarus and Ukraine.

North Korea's case," said chairman of the Duma Committee for 
Defence, Sergey Yushenkov, when he met his British counterpart, 
Chairman of the Permanent Committee for Defence Nicholas Bonser, 
"Ekho Moskvy" radio reported on Tuesday night. 
  Commenting on North Korea's problem, Bonser pointed out that 
the most important thing in this crisis was to show firm 
determination so that other countries would not be tempted to 
follow North Korea's example. Otherwise, a potential threat of 
a nuclear conflict might appear for the first time after the 
Second World War, the British lawmaker said. 
  Yushenkov pointed out that the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme can play an important role in the prevention of 
conflicts similar to the Yugoslav and Korean crises.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in 
Russian at 1755 GMT on 14 June reports that Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the Russian State Duma told the visiting British 
member of parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the 
Commons defense committee, that currently the topmost task was 
to adopt the federal budget for the current year, ITAR-TASS 
said, quoting Rybkin as having said that "the principle of 
sensible sufficiency" ought to underpin defense spending in 
Russia. 
  Cooperation between both parliaments, world ecology, the 
stockpiling of nuclear arms, and the proliferation of nuclear 
technologies were discussed, ITAR-TASS said. Rybkin says that 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program was "a bit restricting for 
Russia." 
  Collective security in Russia was also discussed, with the 
Duma's Defense Committee Chairman Sergey Yushenkov in the chair. 
Despite the end of the cold war, it was impossible to prevent 
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, he 
said. Partnership for peace and Russia's participation in 
peacemaking missions were also discussed. 
  British members of parliament were told that Russia was 
concerned about its servicemen having to protect the CIS borders 
in what was a legally unclear area. "While analyzing the 
political and military aspects of the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the British members of parliament expressed 
the hope that democracy in Russia `works long-term,'" ITAR-TASS 
said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS Correspondent Evgeniy Belovitskiy] </F>
  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 15 TASS--Five foreign spies 
were exposed and arrested in Russia in 1994, including an agent 
recruited by the British Secret Service, according to Director 
of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Sergey Stepashin who 
visited the Sakhalin region in the Far East. 
  "Only this year there were five detentions of rather 
important recruited people, including by the British Secret 
Service", he told TASS on Wednesday adding that this proves that 
his service, which emerged after the collapse of the notorious 
KGB, is gradually reviving in its counterintelligence activities. 
  As far as the fight against organised crime is concerned, 
Stepashin urged "extreme measures" and said that certain human 
rights violations are inevitable as mafia is becoming very 
strong. However, he stressed that "there will be no serious 
violations although certain mishaps are possible". 
  He added that law enforcement agencies will work to defend 
the rights of the absolute majority of people and not of those 
"who believe that the law is not for them". 
  Stepashin said that a real gangland war had begun in Russia. 
This is a war "of mafia clans, a war without rules when 
criminals use the latest means of human destruction". In such a 
situation extreme measures are necessary as "other ways of 
struggle do not exist". 
  The Counter-Intelligence Service is going to sign a 
share-power and cooperation agreement with the Interior Ministry 
in the near future. Stepashin said four joint orders are being 
drafted which will share the powers and tasks of both agencies 
and promote their cooperation. 
  The KGB and interior Ministry were always at odds in Soviet 
years arguing about who is the most important. Stepashin 
believes this should no longer happen. "It is time to end the 
contrapposition between the two agencies which is rooted in the 
past". 
  He added that the "serious results" of the joint work of his 
agency, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office will 
be known in four-six weeks.

  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 15 TASS--The chief Russian 
counter-spy said his service is ready to cooperate with Japanese 
colleagues in fighting international crime and solving issues of 
mutual interest. "Regional bodies of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service have been o'kayed to establish 
direct contacts with their colleagues from the land of the 
rising sun", Sergey Stepashin told TASS on Wednesday after 
visiting the Kurile islands in the Far East. 
  Stepashin said it is necessary to join efforts of secret 
services of various countries to fight international crime. His 
service has concluded corresponding agreements with 38 partners 
in other states. Eight new agreements are being prepared, 
including with China, South Korea and Egypt, according to 
Stepashin.

  [Text] Murmansk June 15 TASS--The nuclear power station on 
the Kola peninsula can operate until its design service life 
expires, says a conclusion made by an IAEA commission which has 
just ended its inspection of the station. 
  The commission checked whether recommendations given to the 
personnel of the station by IAEA experts two years ago had been 
followed. It was recommended then to enhance the reliability of 
the safety systems of the first and second nuclear reactors and 
replace outdated equipment by a modern one. The IAEA inspection 
pointed out that half of these recommendations had been already 
fulfilled.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- "Russia and Vietnam step up 
trade and economic cooperation, and we are sure that the visit 
to Moscow by Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet will promote the 
further deepening of business ties between the two countries and 
enhance their effectiveness," Lev Antoshchenkov, deputy chief of 
the main agency for trade and economic cooperation with Asian 
countries and the Asia-Pacific region at the Russian Ministry of 
External Economic Relations, told ITAR-TASS. 
  The value of trade between Russia and Vietnam made up more 
than 300 million dollars last year, Antoshchenkov said. Both 
sides no longer establish rigid quotas on trade. Instead they 
coordinate the lists of goods in which they are interested. 
Russian consumers receive from Vietnam rice, meat, tea, coffee, 
vegetables and friut, spices, rugs and carpets, footwear, sewn 
articles, knitgoods and other goods. Incidentally, the 
exhibition of goods that opened at the Vietnamese trade mission 
in Moscow on June 14 shows Vietnam's export potentials. Vietnam 
is interested in purchasing from Russia road-building equipment, 
metals, fertiliser, timber and sawn timber. 
  Russia deliveries of sets of equipment for the construction 
of various facilities are of much importance to Vietnam, 
Antoshchenkov said. The construction of the Hoabinh hydropower 
station will be completed this year. The biggest hydropower 
station in South East Asia with a capacity of two million 
kilowatts will go into operation in September. A hydropower 
station will be build in Yali in the Danang District. This will 
make it possible to supply enough electricity to central 
Vietnam. The construction of the Laokai complex with an 
enrichment factory to produce 1.5 million tonnes of apatite 
concentrate a year will be completed this year. 
  Both sides expressed satisfaction with a successful 
functioning of the joint venture Vietsovpetro which extracted 
over 20 million tonnes of crude oil from the shelf of Vietnam in 
the period of the venture's existence. The volume of extraction 
will surpass six million tonnes this year. 
  Vietnam will continue goods deliveries towards repaying its 
debt to Russia, Antoshchenkov said. 
  During the visit of the Vietnamese Premier accompanied by a 
large group of officials from various ministries and agencies, 
representatives of the Vietnamese business circles will hold 
substantive talks for the speeding up of the implementation of 
the earlier achieved arrangements and will discuss projects for 
cooperation. A number of documents, including agreements on 
cooperation in the area of agro-industrial complexes and 
fisheries will be signed.

  [Text] Sofia June 14 TASS -- "Our visit to Bulgaria was not 
of so much parliamentary, as of state nature, more so, it was 
agreed to by the Russian president, government, and, in essence, 
precedes Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's scheduled for this 
fall visit to Sofia, when important documents for cooperation 
between the two countries are planned to be signed," Russian 
Federation Council (upper house of parliament) chairman Vladimir 
Shumeyko, who headed a Russian parliamentary delegation to 
Bulgaria, said at a press conference here today. 
  Shumeyko paid great attention to the question of further 
interaction in different spheres between Russia and Bulgaria. 
He expressed the view that "the development of relations 
between the two countries should not be allowed to take their 
own course." The Russian politician explained this thought, 
while answering an ITAR- TASS question regarding the assessment 
of the fulfillment of the interstate treaty on friendly 
relations and cooperation signed during Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to Sofia in August 1992. 
  "The treaty is being implemented in an unsatisfactory 
manner. 
Suffice it say that at that time an accord was reached to 
resolve the problem of mutual debts within a short period, but 
the problem has not yet been resolved," Shumeyko said. 
  In this context Shumeyko recalled the important role played 
by parliaments of both countries, which should assist "lawfully 
ensure" mutual cooperation, thereby removing different kinds of 
barriers which exist on the path to movement of capital, in the 
sphere of trade and setting up large industrial and finance 
groups. 
  On the whole, Shumeyko values Bulgaria as an important 
strategic partner of Russia on the Balkans, with which Russia 
intends to interact within the Black Sea economic cooperation 
framework. 
  As far as the Yugoslavian crisis is concerned, according to 
Shumeyko, Russia principly adheres to the stand of "achieving a 
compromise, reconciliation of the parties, and not punishing 
only one of them," the Federation Council chairman said. 
  According to Shumeyko, the dialogue held with the Bulgarian 
leadership has showed that the two sides, in principle, do not 
have any differences over the question of participating in 
integration processes taking place in Europe. This, in 
particular, applies to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" programme, 
and joining other European structures, including Council of 
Europe. Certain differences of opinion, which cropped up during 
the talks, bear rather tactical than strategical nature, he said. 
  Answering several questions regarding the implementation of 
democratic reforms in Russia and the society's present state 
asked by Bulgarian journalists, Shumeyko said that he does not 
consider it feasible to hold pre-term presidential elections, 
since he does not see "any potential basis" for this, as well as 
he does for any dramatic social shakeups in the country. The 
Federation Council chairman also touched on the recent 
pessimistic statements made by nobel laureate Aleksndr 
Solzhenitsyn about the prospects of the formation of a 
democratic society in Russia. Every man of letters is free to 
voice his opinion, but I do not share the great writer's 
pessimism, vladimir Shumeyko said.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Knyazkov under "Military-Political Review" </F>
rubric: "The Last of the 90,000.... Heavy Burden Falls to Lot 
of Russian Servicemen Still in Estonia"] 
  [Text] In 1990 there were 90,000 Soviet Army servicemen on 
Estonian territory. Now all that is left of the once mighty 
military grouping which Russia has taken under its jurisdiction 
is something in the order of 2,500 men and, as the Estonian 
press notes ironically, nowadays there is one Russian officer 
for every three soldiers. Surely not a single army in the world 
has such a ratio. Nonetheless the Russian military units, which 
are concentrated in only a few garrisons, are still being 
clamorously called "occupying" units, and Estonia regards their 
presence as a direct threat to the country's sovereignty. 
Special concern is apparently being caused by the two nuclear 
reactors at the naval base in Paldiski and the 144th Motorized 
Rifle Division, which has weapons and armored personnel carriers 
as well as around 30 tanks. In the republic capital itself an 
ammunition dump which originally contained 7,000 items in 
storage is under the constant attention of the Estonian 
military. True, now there are considerably fewer of them, since 
ammunition is being continuously taken off to Russia. 
  The Baltic Fleet has already withdrawn its ships, but 
something like around 12 half-sunken old "tubs" have been left 
at piers in Tallinn and Paldiski. 
  Citing these figures to Moscow journalists, the Estonian 
military observed that, besides the "purely military aspect," 
they are concerned by the fact that the Russian garrisons pose a 
danger "as a hotbed of crime and of weapons and metal 
smuggling." Something similar has already been voiced in a RIA 
report cited by Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar, so when given 
the opportunity to talk to the Estonian premier personally in 
Tallin, I asked him to clarify the facts cited. 
  "The Estonian police did indeed recently arrest a group of 
Russian servicemen trading in weapons and metals," Laar replied. 
"Incidentally, the Russian Prosecutor's Office is also working 
on these cases. But we are especially concerned by the trade in 
radioactive metals. According to our information the Baltic 
Fleet recently sold and exported from Estonia several ships 
containing a considerable dose of radioactive contamination." 
  I think the thesis regarding the "criminalization" of the 
remnants of Russian troops in Estonia is no accident, especially 
as certain incidents "have occurred." But by the way, it is 
relevant to recall that our servicemen are permitted to sell 
some metals and surplus property locally. All the funds earned, 
Colonel General Leonid Mayorov, commander of the Northwestern 
Group of Forces, stressed in a conversation with me, are going 
on the construction of housing for military pensioners in 
Russia. But in my view the issue here is that, by raising a 
delicate subject, officials in Tallinn are thereby trying to 
exert pressure on Moscow and to mold public opinion in a certain 
way. The aim is well known -- to get Russia to withdraw its 
troops before 31 August 1994. But the point is that, following 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn, when 
the signing of the appropriate troop withdrawal treaty started 
to look more certain, Estonia itself has been holding up the 
troop withdrawal willy-nilly. 
  "The Russian side is making active preparations for the 
transportation of nuclear reactors, fuel, and radioactive waste 
from Paldiski," Anatoliy Chizhikov, military attache at the 
Russian Embassy in Estonia, related. "Containers are being 
delivered and the necessary equipment and specialists are 
arriving: Unique work lies ahead! But instead of helping us in 
this the Estonian side is delaying the matter in every way 
possible." 
  It turned out that originally in order for the specialists 
to enter Estonia promptly they needed merely to put in a claim 
at the Estonian Foreign Ministry, which would the be transmitted 
to the border.... But visas were soon introduced, but for some 
time the Estonian border services did not even "know about it." 
  "Estonia is trying to hasten the Baltic Fleet's final 
departure," Vice Admiral Anatoliy Gavrilov, commander of the 
Tallin Naval Base, said. "We reached agreement with a Norwegian 
firm to help us raise four cutters that sank in Paldiski and it 
would acquire them as scrap. Three cutters were raised, but 
then Estonian representatives intervened. They protested the 
deal and, as a result, we had to...scuttle the cutters that had 
already been raised." 
  Vice Adm. Gavrilov categorically denied the Estonian side's 
suggestions that the Baltic Fleet is selling "contaminated" 
ships. According to him, before any trade deals go ahead the 
ships are "cleaned" of radioactive waste, if there is any. This 
process is strictly monitored. 
  It seems as though problems will even arise at the final 
stage of the troop withdrawal. Anatoliy Ivanov, 
minister-counselor at the Russian Embassy in Tallin, explained 
that we will have to hand over our military camps and their 
property under formal instruments [akty], and there is no doubt 
that the meticulous Estonians will count every last item. What, 
for instance, was the commander of a military unit near Tallin 
meant to do? In April the "Kaitseliit" (armed militiamen), 
which are structurally part of the republic's Defense Ministry, 
removed three 24-meter masts from the antenna field under the 
threat of force. And, despite a protest from the embassy, no 
apology was forthcoming and the antennas have not been returned. 
  Our military have long since disappeared from the streets of 
Estonian cities -- officers and NCO's switched to civilian dress 
a few years ago so as "not to traumatize" the local population 
too much. But within the garrison of the 144th Division, based 
on the outskirts of Tallin, everything is like a "normal" 
military unit -- uniforms and meticulous garrison duty at 
checkpoints, in the staff, and in the military subunits. 
  "Although there has been no political solution to the troop 
withdrawal, we are preparing to redeploy," the chief of staff, 
Guards Colonel Yevgeniy Lazebin, noted. "People's morale is 
good. An operational group is at work at the new site. The 
question of rented accommodations for officers' families is 
being resolved, and South Korea's Samsung has promised to build 
us residential quarters by August of next year. The first five 
blocks will be built by the end of the year." 
  But not everything has been so smooth -- combat subunits are 
having to be temporarily billeted in the field. In the absence 
of any accommodations in Russia, officers' families have been 
forced to send their personal effects and furniture to their 
relatives' apartments. 
  "And, incidentally, 30 percent of families have nowhere at 
all to put their things," Guards Lieutenant Colonel Gennadiy 
Kaverda, the division's psychologist, explained. "This means 
that some things will have to be sold off, and there is no need 
to mention how hard officers' families are taking it." 
  In conclusion, I would like to say the following. For a long 
time Russian troops were an important factor in the difficult 
dialogue between Estonia and Russia. Relying on this, Russia 
tried to solve the problems of social protection for military 
pensioners and the civil rights of the Russian-speaking 
population in Estonia. This tactic did not meet with any 
particular success. The negotiating process is deadlocked.... 
Meanwhile, the troops have been leaving for Russia and are 
being cut back locally. Some people in Estonia have gotten the 
idea that it is possible not only to insist on an immediate 
Russian troop withdrawal, but also, if necessary, on "making 
Russian servicemen withdraw by force." That was the sense of 
statements made by General Aleksandr Einseln, commander of the 
Estonian Defense Forces. Fortunately, sober-minded trends have 
prevailed at top political level in Estonia of late. The 
fruitful meetings in Tallin between the Estonian leadership and 
Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his 
deputy Vitaliy Churkin inspire hope that the disputes between 
the two countries -- disputes at the focus of which Russian 
servicemen have found themselves -- will be resolved in a 
civilized fashion.

SEGODNYA in the "Struggle" column: "The Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Promises Tough Measures Against 
Bandits. The State Duma May Not Support Them"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Security Council and the 
General Prosecutor's Office are to supervise the implementation 
of the 5 trillion ruble program to control organized crime. 
This was announced at a press conference at the end of last 
week by Security Council Deputy Chairman Vladimir Rubanov and 
Acting General Prosecutor Aleksey Ilyushenko. On 23 June an 
expanded collegium will be held at the General Prosecutor's 
Office on the issue of fighting organized crime. 
  The new program envisions international cooperation in 
controlling organized crime, as well as participation by a 
number of ministries and departments. According to Vladimir 
Rubanov, work is fully under way on implementing the program. 
  Counterintelligence chief Sergey Stepashin reported that in 
combating organized crime, all regular and covert operation 
means will be employed. Approximately 800 experienced 
investigators are to be involved. Stepashin said that there is 
preliminary agreement with major banks on cooperation. In the 
very near future documents will be signed on dividing functions 
between the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] and the 
Internal Affairs Ministry. Stepashin admitted that in 
implementing the program, to make sure that the rights of 99 
percent of citizens are protected, human rights will be violated 
to an extent. In this connection, the FCS chief expressed 
concern that the State Duma may not approve the proposed drastic 
measures. 
  Responding to questions from journalists, Aleksandr 
Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Press Service, who was present at 
the press conference, said: "If we recall history, in 1918 the 
capital was swept by robberies and lootings, with people afraid 
to go out into the street. And then a Moscow commission took 
emergency measures. The commission made sure that all criminals 
were caught and shot." In the present conditions, Mikhaylov 
said, "any tough measures which will be taken with respect to 
the criminal world will be supported by society."

  [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Despite all the reshuffling 
and financial difficulties, the Russian intelligence remains 
among the four best secret services in the world which also 
include the CIA, the Israeli Mossad and the British secret 
service. "We have always been in the league and, I hope, will 
remain there", first deputy director of the Russian Foreign 
Intelligence Service (SVR) Vyacheslav Trubnikov told TASS on 
Tuesday. 
  He did not specify who occupies which place among the four, 
but said that hardly any of the secret services would have 
succeeded to maintain the leading positions had they been in the 
same financial plight as the SVR. 
  "I am sure that had the personnel of our `competitors' been 
in the same conditions as the Russian intelligence is facing, 
hardly many of them would have tolerated that. And our men do 
serve and will serve", Trubnikov said. 
  The Foreign Intelligence Service which appeared after the 
collapse of the notorious KGB is no longer engaged in political 
persecutions. According to Trubnikov, "intelligence ceased to 
be a semi-state and semi-(communist) party body which it was in 
the times of the KGB". It no longer works for any political 
party, advocates no ideology, acts independently and according 
to law and is controlled by the legislative and executive 
authorities. 
  The task of the intelligence is to monitor and assess 
threats 
to Russian national interests. "In general the tendencies in 
world development are favourable for our country, however, the 
spectrum of threats remains rather wide", Trubnikov said and 
added that the major threat at present is the "hot spots" on the 
Russian borders.

compatriots abroad. 
  Vladimir Kozhemiakin, who headed Sergey Shakhray secretariat 
before his election to the State Duma, will replace Zatulin as 
secretary of the PRES faction in parliament.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1525 GMT on 14 June 1994 broadcasts a 30-minute 
program entitled "Debates" chaired by correspondent A.N. 
Kuryakov with N.T. Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission, and Doctor of Law Yu.A. Vedeneyev of the Institute 
of State and Law, in which they discussed the articles that have 
appeared in the press recently questioning the validity of the 
12 December referendum on the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Referring to the allegations, Ryabov starts by noting: "The 
newspaper IZVESTIYA has called them political dynamite but I 
would call them political soap because dynamite and soap are 
rather similar in external appearance but are quite different in 
their effect. Also, these press articles leave behind only soap 
bubbles. So, we have not paid any particular attention to these 
analysts and their deductions." 
  One of the main areas of criticism has been about alleged 
discrepancies in the total numbers of votes cast, "but these 
authors have either forgotten or have deliberately omitted the 
other five parties that took part in the elections. They did 
not surmount the five percent barrier, but some people did vote 
for them; they accounted together for 4.7 million votes. So if 
one compares the number of votes cast in favor of the 
Constitution with the number of votes cast for the party lists, 
one can see that the Constitution was passed." 
  Ryabov goes on to examine various details of the allegations 
and produced documentary evidence to show that they were untrue. 
He concludes: "There is not a single documented fact that 
proves these falsifications, and certainly none showing massive 
falsifications, which these few authors write about so 
ecstatically." 
  Legal expert Vedeneyev points out that the Supreme Court has 
issued a decision confirming the validity of the referendum. 
Ryabov recalls that on 16 March 1994 the Supreme Court had 
rejected the Russian Communist Workers' Party appeal for the 
referendum to be deemed invalid. International observers had 
also approved the validity of the voting, he says. 
  Vedeneyev says that the political forces which did not like 
the election results were trying to cast doubt on them. "There 
is also an attempt to instill uncertainty and dissatisfaction in 
the public consciousness and once again to initiate the 
atmosphere of crisis, which was characteristic of 1993." Ryabov 
agrees and goes on: "This sort of article is coming from 
representatives of certain political forces that are either 
outside the legitimate political system such as the Russian 
Communist Workers' Party or else are formally within the real 
political system, but because of the forms and methods of 
struggle they use cannot be fully part of this system." 
  Ryabov suggests that these allegations had been raised now 
in 
response to the draft law guaranteeing electoral rights, which 
has been submitted by the president to the Federal Assembly. 
  Ryabov concludes by recalling that all legal suits against 
the validity of the referendum had been rejected and the authors 
of the recent allegations "for some reason are not in a hurry to 
apply to the courts."

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Refugees" rubric: "There </F>
May Soon Be 6 Million Migrants in Russia. Despairing Deserters 
Get Together in `Death Squads'"] 
  [Text] Dmitriy Rogozin, leader of the Congress of Russian 
Communities [CRC], and Garold Zavadko, cochairman of the "Union 
of Russian Refugees," held a press conference yesterday at which 
they told journalists about the position of Russian refugees in 
Russia. They think it has deteriorated sharply today. As the 
"Union of Russian Refugees" stated, a campaign has begun lately 
to evict refugees staying in holiday hotels near Moscow. 
Several court cases have been heard and have reached a decision 
"to evict without providing [alternative] housing." In the 
opinion of Mr. Zavadko, there is "collusion between organs of 
state power against the refugees and a threat of their second 
deportation." 
  Speaking about prospects for migration of the "Slavic 
population" from CIS countries and the Baltic states to Russia, 
Dmitriy Rogozin expects that some 6 million forced migrants may 
arrive in Russia in the next two years. It was pointed out that 
the real number exceeds that registered by the Federal Migration 
Service. Pointing to the fact that under the government 
directives of 1 May 1994 each refugee should be issued with 1 
million rubles for resettlement, Mr. Rogozin told those present 
to figure out the sum that will have to be earmarked from the 
state budget. The CRC leader also sharply criticized the 
current relief system. Dmitriy Rogozin hopes that during the 
meeting which he may have with Boris Yeltsin during the coming 
month he will be able to convince the president to give a tax 
break to the charity tasked with providing real aid to refugees. 
  Mr. Rogozin and Mr. Zavadko singled out the problem of the 
Russian draftees who have deserted from national armies over 
politically motivated harassment by their fellow draftees. In 
the opinion of Dmitriy Rogozin, the despairing deserters, unless 
they get assistance, may take refuge in quarters close to the 
shadow economy or even form the basis for "death squads" which 
would "start taking vengeance on those to blame for their 
plight."

  [Text] Blagoveshchensk, 15 Jun -- At a meeting with Amur 
Oblast officials today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin spoke 
about the strategic purpose of reducing the strength of the 
Russian Army from three million servicemen to one and a half 
million. 
  Speaking about the provision of the Russian Army with 
technical equipment, the president said it did not need much 
equipment, but it needed mobile weapons which could compete on 
international market. 
  Boris Yeltsin spoke about an intention to share the arms 
markets for selling Russian military equipment and said that 
following the Malaysian example, Thailand and Australia would 
also be buying Russian weapons. "There are no ideological 
obstacles to this," Boris Yeltsin stressed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed feature under the "At First Hand" rubric: "Is </F>
There Opposition Within the Defense Ministry?"] 
  [Text] In recent months a number of publications have used 
various conversations behind the scenes or in the corridors of 
power, chance details, and sometimes even outright rumor and 
gossip to constantly raise the subject of official and personal 
relationships in the top military leadership. Conclusions have 
been drawn about the alleged existence of serious differences 
between the defense minister, his deputies, and other members of 
the Russian Defense Ministry Collegium. From time to time 
either one general or another will be dubbed an open or secret 
opposition figure by the press.... 
  Well, official -- much less, personal -- relationships, and 
at such high level, are a very delicate matter. It has always 
been considered inappropriate to make certain aspects of them 
public. But since things are now reaching the point where this 
problem is being intensively given essentially political 
overtones, we need nonetheless to make things clear. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Editorial Office asked a number of 
Defense Ministry leaders and members of the Defense Ministry 
Collegium to answer the following questions: 
  1. How do you assess the current state of official and 
personal relationships among the leading staff of the Armed 
Forces, and the atmosphere at Defense Ministry Collegium 
sessions and in general when highly important decisions on 
issues of the Armed Forces' life and activity are being made? 
  2. What is your attitude to articles -- including those 
about you personally -- which claim that relations within the 
Armed Forces are now complex and contradictory, and that there 
is a kind of split and an interpersonal struggle under way? 
  Andrey Kokoshin, first deputy defense minister: 
  1-2. There is a businesslike, constructive relationship 
within the Defense Ministry leadership. Not least I can note 
with satisfaction the equable, comradely relations with Army 
General P.S. Grachev, defense minister. 
  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed 
Forces 
General Staff and first deputy defense minister: 
  1. I cannot say what official and personal relationships 
within the Defense Ministry leading staff were like in years 
gone by. But I can state with complete authority that the 
current atmosphere at the Defense Ministry can be expressed in 
two words -- "working condition." Let me explain what I mean by 
this. The most important decisions on the issues of Armed 
Forces reform and their activity and everyday life are not at 
all reached in secret or behind the scenes -- as is sometimes 
claimed in the mass media. Also groundless are the claims that 
all the recent decisions on Armed Forces reform have been 
unexpected and have come out of the blue for most Defense 
Ministry leaders. 
  In confirmation of that I would cite a very recent incident. 
Literally the other day we were reporting our proposals to the 
defense minister on optimizing the organizational and staffing 
structure of the Armed Forces' central apparatus. In 
particular, this report clarified the list of posts taking 
account of existing realities. The preparatory work was done 
with the involvement of the commanders in chief of the branches 
of service, commanders of combat arms, and so forth. There were 
no behind-the-scenes games or intrigues. A representative of 
the Russian Federation Presidential Staff also took part in the 
work. This is important too -- it is yet more evidence of the 
growing civil control over the Armed Forces' activity. 
  A detailed report was made, analyzing why a certain decision 
was being made. The defense minister supported our proposals. 
Incidentally, as part of my job as chief of the General Staff I 
report to the minister highly important documents prepared by 
the General Staff. Some 95 percent of these documents -- maybe 
an even higher percentage -- are adopted on first submission. 
This too, I think, is typical of the level of working relations 
within the Defense Ministry. And it is nothing to do with me 
personally. It is a question of the prestige of the General 
Staff, which has highly professional officers and generals 
working for it. It is thanks to their supreme responsibility! 
For some reason I find it easy talking with my boss, the 
defense minister. 
  As for Defense Ministry Collegium sessions -- first and 
foremost, I should mention the openness between Collegium 
members. There are plenty of examples of issues being worked out 
at deputy minister or branch of service commander in chief level 
and then being reported to the Collegium as an initiative. I do 
not recall a single instance when the minister rejected our 
proposals. 
  2. I think that it is clear from my response to the first 
question that the press reports to the effect that people in the 
Defense Ministry take no account of the opinion of the chief of 
the General Staff are without any real foundation. I consider 
such articles an attempt to split the leading staff of the Armed 
Forces. What is the objective? It is, I think, to create a 
climate of distrust between us and, as a result, to get us 
involved in a political struggle on the side of various forces. 
Just look at what these articles are about.... They alleged 
that First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin 
had "not become part of the military collective." That "Afghan" 
generals oppose the others and, moreover, that there is fierce 
confrontation between certain groupings within the Defense 
Ministry. But what is typical is that nobody knows about such 
groupings -- they simply do not exist. 
  Now to the rumors which are also being put about in the 
press 
claiming that there is a strained relationship between the 
defense minister and the chief of the General Staff. All lies! 
Pavel Sergeyevich Grachev and I are not personal friends, but 
we have a good working relationship. And that is the most 
important thing when it comes to doing to the job. 
  Colonel General Boris Gromov, deputy defense minister: 
  1. There has indeed been some talk of late about serious 
differences among the Russian Armed Forces leadership. What can 
I say? To my mind, relations between the defense minister, his 
deputies, and the commanders in chief -- in other words, the 
Collegium members -- are now just the way they should be. 
Businesslike and calm. All our complex problems -- and we have 
no easy ones -- are being resolved. 
  As a rule, everyone gets to speak at Collegium sessions. As 
far as I am concerned, I express my opinion to the extent I 
consider necessary. There are no restrictions here. I think 
that this will be confirmed by the fact that there is always an 
atmosphere at the sessions that makes it possible to discuss and 
resolve any issues calmly and professionally. The defense 
minister's attitude to all Collegium members is very equable, 
businesslike, and -- I would particularly like to emphasize this 
-- respectful. This too, you will understand, makes it possible 
for everyone to say what they consider needs saying and to 
discuss important problems without any reservations -- just as 
their experience and their own assessments of the state of 
affairs prompt them to. 
  All the more so as I have things to recall. As commander of 
Kiev Military District, I had to attend the USSR Defense 
Ministry Collegium. When I was appointed first deputy defense 
minister, I naturally took part in the work of the Union MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] Collegium. The atmosphere at our 
sessions, if compared with those days, is considerably more 
democratic. And there are simply no advance instructions or any 
kind of pressure about how to speak or what to say. 
  It is logical to ask whether this happens outside the 
auditorium. We have normal relationships which allow us -- both 
individually and jointly -- to carry out our official duties 
normally. In short, there is nothing between Collegium members 
of the kind that has been reported in the mass media -- no 
hostility and no covert opposition to the minister. 
  2. There have been lots of articles about me, and, clearly, 
there will continue to be. I try not to comment on them. I 
think that anyone with a definite experience of life, a man of 
dignity and honor, and a man of some humor must ultimately take 
that attitude to articles about him personally. It is another 
matter when state interests are affected. I recall that I won a 
court case when Colonel Vilen Martirosyan, my colleague in the 
former Union corps of deputies and now a "genuine Ukrainian," 
called me a possible military dictator in a Kiev newspaper in 
1990. 
  If you take other articles, also written, as a rule, on the 
basis of rumor (I consider that articles about relationships 
within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry fall into 
precisely this category), then, of course, you would like to 
respond, not least in the press. But refuting fabrications and 
rumors is an ignoble task, and sometimes unnecessary. 
Nonetheless, the "bearers of the truth" cannot be dissuaded. 
They will continue their petty intrigues. One thing is 
reassuring -- there are far fewer of these people than there are 
of those who understand the position of the person talking or 
writing. And time will sort everything out. 
  Army General Konstantin Kobets, Russian Federation chief 
military inspector and deputy defense minister: 
  1. I would like to note straightaway that there has never 
been an instance when the Defense Ministry Collegium failed to 
reach any decision unanimously. Of course, there are disputed 
points. We receive in advance all the issues which it is 
planned to examine at the Collegium, and, naturally, we study 
them carefully. The opinions of the deputy ministers and 
commanders in chief are always taken into account. I repeat -- 
always! If we fail to reach a unified decision, a working group 
of experts from all Armed Forces branches of services has to be 
set up. All the "pros" and "cons" are taken into account. And 
only after this is the matter put to the Collegium session. 
  Respecting a different opinion is a typical feature of the 
defense minister's and one that I would particularly note. And 
this has become the rule for our relations at Collegium 
sessions. But if a decision is made, it has to be implemented. 
There can be no excuses or reservations about it. 
  On the whole, I believe that the Defense Ministry in its 
work 
professes the following main principle: We are all in the same 
boat and we are all working to the "commander's plan" -- that 
person being the supreme commander in chief or the defense 
minister, depending on the importance of the issue. But I would 
also like to say something about personal relationships. Our 
families often meet up outside of work -- on holidays, for 
instance. I think that this says a lot too. 
  2. Articles about allegedly strained relations between 
Defense Ministry leaders primarily surprise me rather than 
evoking hostility. Because there is not a grain of truth in 
them. Where does all this gossip come from? So I would say to 
journalists -- don't use random, unchecked information. Don't 
cheat your readers! 
  Colonel General Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of the 
Ground Forces: 
  1. It would be wrong to say that each member of the Defense 
Ministry Collegium cannot have his own opinion. After all, we 
prepare in advance for the discussion of the matters at issue, 
and we prepare seriously. It is normal that everyone should 
have their own opinion. I think that the defense minister is 
quite right to listen to his deputies and commanders in chief. 
I do not recall his ever saying "That's enough!" to someone, 
even if he disagrees with him. Or that he takes the view that 
he has formed his own opinion and that yours does not interest 
him.... All proposals are listened to attentively. 
  I am sure that the atmosphere at the Collegium should be 
like 
this. It is all the more absurd to claim that if some Collegium 
member has his own view of a specific problem, he becomes an 
opponent of the minister or, moreover, moves into opposition.... 
We have a normal working atmosphere. I personally do not know 
of any overt or covert opposition. So why are there constantly 
articles in the press about this? So as to set us Collegium 
members against each other? To sow distrust among us? A lack 
of trust in the minister on our part, and in us on his. 
Incidentally, one thing is absolutely clear. All such articles 
are aimed one way or the other at creating an unhealthy 
atmosphere around the Armed Forces. 
  The fact that once the Collegium has adopted a decision, the 
decree needs to be strictly monitored is another matter. We 
have been insufficiently demanding in this area [imenno zdes u 
nas prinizhen spros]. Clearly, that is the fault of the 
Collegium secretary, who has failed to provide timely 
information to the minister, and it is our fault -- us Collegium 
members. Previously adopted decisions can be forgotten about 
amid our ongoing work. That is something that should be 
criticized. 
  2. My opinion is this. Criticism of the Army has entered a 
new phase, if I can put it that way. In the Gorbachev era 
attacks were sanctioned from on high so as to ensure that the 
people had no doubt about the Union leadership's attitude toward 
the Armed Forces. And the USSR president himself set the tone. 
The people, as a result, started to lose faith in the Army's 
prestige. False premises typical of Gorbachev (talking, for 
instance, about cutting back some divisions, he sometimes tried 
to add: "I've taken the trough away from a few generals") were 
picked up on from below. Everyone knows what this led to. 
  Now, in my view, the attacks on the Armed Forces are 
connected with attempts by various political forces and parties 
to sow discord among the Defense Ministry leadership and to 
pressure the Russian Federation Defense Ministry Collegium and 
assert their own influence in military circles. Everyone knows 
that in our difficult time the Armed Forces are the only stable 
organism in the state. The Army can do a very great deal to 
strengthen Russian statehood. But certain politicians are 
simply uninterested in this. For them one slogan is acceptable 
-- the worse, the better. That is where the current criticism 
comes from. All kinds of rumors and fables get into the press 
by whatever means. For instance, I was struck by an article in 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY to the effect that Semenov is in opposition to 
the defense minister. But what is typical is that nobody, 
including the writer, could explain where this information came 
form. "Somebody told me, I heard it somewhere" -- those are not 
arguments. That is why I have the reaction to these articles 
that I have.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Defense Minister Yevgeniy </F>
Shaposhnikov, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given -- recorded; from the "Aty-Baty" program] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] When you became defense 
minister, how did you envision the new army, how did you 
envision the reforms of the army that we had and, in your 
opinion, how much were you able to achieve of what you had 
envisioned? 
  [Shaposhnikov] The Russian Army absorbed the major part of 
the Soviet Armed Forces and naturally, at that time it was, and 
still is, of great interest to me. I cannot remain indifferent 
to the issue of what is going on in the army with regard to 
reforms. I have several views, or rather, thoughts on the 
subject and I would like to share them. 
  The army has lost the simple and clear reference point that 
the concept of the enemy used to provide. When the civil war 
ended, our leaders, the leaders of the young Soviet Republic, 
began a tenfold reduction of the armed forces despite being 
surrounded by the enemy. Today, the opportunity exists and such 
conditions have been created that I am actually convinced that 
no one will attack us if we have reliable strategic forces and 
border troops. 
  I am not revealing any secrets by telling you that within 
the 
Defense Ministry, like in any other ministry, there is definite 
lobbying. Speaking unconditionally, or rather conditionally so 
as not to correlate it with anyone or anything, as an example 
let us assume that the General Staff, or the defense minister, 
gets an idea to abolish the Air Defense High Command. How will 
the Air Defense High Command react? He will make the rounds of 
all the directorates, all the services; he will load the problem 
onto all the scientific research establishments, the Academy of 
Sciences, and so on; and then he will come back to the minister 
and report that it is impossible to implement. This would be 
the same with the Air Force and so on. I will represent all 
these problems as a thick copse of trees. [Shaposhnikov begins 
to demonstrate with a pen on the table] 
  Let us suppose that the trees are standing here and it is 
decided to thin some of the them out, remove and forget about 
them. Then, when the minister or someone else grabs hold of the 
trunk, he finds that all the roots are intertwined below the 
surface and when he tries to pull the problem [trunk] out, this 
single trunk begins to rock all the rest of the trees. 
Consequently, the minister will find it very difficult to solve 
the problem in this way. 
  Therefore, there should be some kind of a state structure or 
committee, be it under the president or the government, that 
would concern itself with these reforms and the resolution of 
all the problems in the system without advocating their own 
various mercenary interests. 
  As you know, after the August events, we began with a 
Military Reform Committee headed by General of the Army Kobets. 
The committee did not develop for many reasons, such as the 
Union's disintegration and so on. However, if there were such a 
body composed of former military people, military scientists, 
civilian military experts, representatives of the military 
industrial complex, outstanding politicians, and various other 
specialists, then we could have done it impartially. 
  [Correspondent] Three years have passed and we still do not 
have that kind of a body. Why? How can we explain this? 
  [Shaposhnikov] That is not a question you should be 
directing to me. [passage omitted] The army should be 
apolitical, outside of the political stream. It has a more 
important and more serious course than adhering to the various 
political flows, movements, structures, leaders, and so on. 
Naturally, for me, these issues are also unpleasant, and now 
even incomprehensible, as they are for you. 
  For instance, let us take the latest event in Crimea where 
the situation is becoming supercharged. While the two 
presidents, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Leonid Makarovich 
Kravchuk are talking to each other about it and are working out 
some kind of a formula to prevent the conflict's settlement 
through force, suddenly we have Mr. Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense 
minister, coming out with the statement and virtually thumping 
the table with his iron fist saying: We will not be stopped by 
anything, let everyone remember that, we will take any, and even 
extreme, decisive measures. I think that as a military man he 
should be silent in these situations. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Has our officer, soldier, [pauses] the 
serviceman become the central figure in the armed forces? Has 
he, in fact, become the figure on whom our whole military policy 
is principally focused? 
  [Shaposhnikov] I would like to believe and think that. 
However, I am convinced that at present we are still far from 
that. Especially if there are some advances in this respect 
then, as we know, there is no limit to perfection in any 
situation.

  [Text] As MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned, recently yet 
another antiterrorist unit has been created in Russia. Now the 
task of freeing hostages captured on the border will be handled 
by specially trained border guard groups. 
  There will be no conscripts serving in this special task 
force. At present work is under way to select graduates from 
border guard schools and reenlisted men for this unit. 
Antiterrorist groups will not be very large: 15 to 20 people. 
So far it is planned to create five groups based in different 
regions of Russian, as a rule near the state border. They will 
be geared toward securing the release of hostages taken on the 
country's territory and taken abroad; that is to say, actions on 
the territory of other states. The special force will be used 
primarily to free Russian servicemen, including border guards. 
The decision to use the special unit will be made at a level 
not below Russian border guards commander. 
  According to some reports, these groups will be trained by 
the Alfa force and its regional subdivisions.

  [Text] Four State Duma committees today held hearings on 
problems of safety in the handling of radioactive waste. In 
Russia today there are 14,500 enterprises where there are over 
700 sources of radiation. In the opinion of the State Committee 
for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the most 
dangerous enterprises are those attached to the Ministry of 
Defense and the (Ministry of Atomic Energy). At our request, 
Nikolay Yegorov, first deputy minister of atomic energy, 
comments on this. 
  [Begin Yegorov recording] Those storehouses where, at 
present, radioactive waste is being dumped or stored do not 
satisfy contemporary requirements, in other words those 
requirements that were made following the Chernobyl disaster and 
which are in accordance with international requirements. But 
radiation safety at these storehouses is being monitored and I 
think -- from my point of view -- it is normal. Present-day 
requirements stipulate that storehouses should be protected from 
air attacks, from natural disasters -- earthquakes and a number 
of other extreme factors. These storehouses do not comply with 
these requirements because when they were designed such norms 
did not exist. [end recording]

"Beneficial to Foreign Companies"] 
  [Text] The question of the possible closure of the 
Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Station has been discussed 
increasingly often recently by the world community, not only at 
an environmental and social level but also at a political level. 
  Circles close to the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic 
Energy have stated that if such a step is taken it will have 
primarily political overtones. In the opinion of the experts, 
this will be beneficial first and foremost to the leading 
foreign nuclear power generation companies.

  [Text] Nalchik June 15 TASS -- A system protecting shelters 
and homes against radioactive fallout has been invented and 
tested at a special testing range by Kuzer Varukov, a scientist 
working at the university in Nalchik, the capital of 
Kabardino-Balkaria (Russian autonomy). 
  A republican commission concluded that "the inventor proved 
in practice the possibility of making apartments and industrial 
premises impervious to radiation and providing effective 
collective protection to urban and rural residents at a lower 
cost". 
  The invention can be used in the clear-up operations after 
accidents at nuclear power plants and other enterprises which 
deal with radioactive and toxic substances. It has been found 
effective by specialists of the Russian nuclear power ministry. 
In their opinion, it allows to localize emission of harmful 
radiation and substances for the duration of work aimed at 
preventing discharge of nuclides in the environment.

  [Text] Blagoveshchensk [center of Amur Oblast], 14 Jun -- 
Boris Yeltsin is concerned that a region of such rich natural 
potential as Amur Oblast should be living off subsidies from the 
federal budget. The Russian president stated this today on his 
arrival in Blagoveshchensk. 
  Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, 
Boris 
Yeltsin said that the Amur Oblast administration chief had 
visited him recently and they had put their heads together over 
how to revitalize the region. The president said that one of 
the aims of his trip to Amur Oblast and the Tuva Republic was to 
study the potential of these regions with a view to identifying 
measures to help extricate their economies from crisis.

  [Text] Blagoveshchensk June 15 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin on Wednesday visited the Blagoveshchensk shipbuilding 
plant. The workers and managerial personnel of the plant told 
Yeltsin about a variety of problems, the main of which is to 
find customers for the manufacture of fishing seiners. The 
president of russian and Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin 
made entries in the visitors' book promising the shipbuilders to 
promote a solution to the problem. 
  Shipbuilders told ITAR-TASS that they have not been 
receiving 
wages since February. Customers -- the fishery enterprises all 
over Far East, acutely need the plant's products but 
nevertheless are unable to pay for the completed seiners. This 
is why the plant managament sends workers on forced leaves. 
With the plant personnel numbering 1,300, the managament has 
already sent 1,000 shipbuilders on leave in June. 
  As of now, the default of payment for completed and building 
ships amount to 8,000 million roubles. 
  The defence and interior ministries owe about 1,500 million 
roubles to the plant. 
  The president toured a small fishing seiner of the latest 
make and visited the shipbuilding shop. 
  During a meeting with the management of the plant, Boris 
Yeltsin once again promised to give assistance in the search for 
customers for large fishing seiners and suggested making small 
boats, which farmers need, on direct, non-state orders.

of bankruptcy indicating bankrupt enterprises every month will 
be put into effect in the near future in accordance with the 
Russian president's decree. This was announced by Boris Yeltsin 
at a meeting with managers of enterprises of the Amur region on 
Wednesday. 
  President Yeltsin, currently on a working visit to the city 
of Blagoveshchensk and the republic of Tuva, believes that "the 
current task is to transfer reforms from a macro to a micro 
level, to the level of enterprises," which should more actively 
attract investments to boost production and resolve social tasks. 
  "The times when enterprises and whole regions lived at the 
expense of the state budget are over. It is necessary to find 
one's own resources to survive since living on subsidies under 
market conditions is a shame," Yeltsin said. 
  He recommended to regional heads to make use of the 
president's recent decree on the expansion of the activities of 
foreign banks on the territory of the Russian Federation and 
attract major Korean or Japanese capital into the region.

over video; correspondent identified by caption] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin completed his visit 
to Amur Oblast today, and he and his entourage have left for the 
Tuva Republic. Just a few hours ago Aleksandr Shkirando, our 
special correspondent, sent us a report from Blagoveshchensk on 
Boris Yeltsin's working trip to Amur oblast. 
  [Begin recording] [Shkirando, over video showing Yeltsin in 
a 
workshop talking to staff; Blagoveshchensk identified by 
caption] The itinerary of the Russian president's working visit 
to Blagoveshchensk is extremely full. In the morning Boris 
Nikolayevich visited the shipyard and met its workers. 
  [Yeltsin, surrounded by a crowd in workshop, addresses 
unidentified woman in the crowd] How much is your pension? 
  [Woman] Seventy-three. [not further identified] 
  [Yeltsin] Seventy-three. That is not much. 
  [Woman] Yes, that is a small amount. 
  [Yeltsin] Perhaps we need to raise pensions this year, in 
two 
or three months. I understand that your wages amount to about 
200,000, 25000 or 300,000. Am I right? Three hundred thousand 
is enough to live on, is it not? Without luxuries but enough, 
especially considering that both food and consumer goods shops 
are full. Those things of the past just do not exist any 
longer. One no longer has to suffer the humiliation of waiting 
in lines. One can buy everything. But...of course, things are 
expensive. That is without doubt. 
  [Shkirando] The president also talked about the problem of 
taxes, which is a dire problem for all Russian citizens. 
  [Yeltsin] All production taxes, according to the 15 economic 
decrees I signed, will be cut by about 10-20 percent this year. 
It will vary from industry to industry. 
  [Unidentified man] Production taxes? 
  [Yeltsin] Yes, production taxes. As to the income tax, there 
will be several levels to it. We have rich people who earn 5 
million a month. Their earnings must of course be properly 
chopped, while those who receive 300,000-400,000 or up to 
500,000 should be taxed proportionately and in a balanced way. 
  [Shkirando] To help the president address the whole range of 
issues, high ranking leaders and government officials, including 
Shokhin, Zaveryukha, and Shafrannik, arrived with him in 
Blagoveshchensk. Local authorities have expressed the hope that 
at long last a number of dire problems affecting all of the Far 
East will be addressed. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow June 15 ITAR-TASS -- The idea of building a 
new Russian space centre in the Amur region, which would help 
effectively solve the Baykonur problem, was supported by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Blagoveshchensk. 
  During the president's visit, the question was discussed 
with 
the chief of the space-equipment testing centre Major-General 
Aleksandr Vinidiktov. 
  According to Vinidiktov, he did not have to convince Boris 
Yeltsin that the new space project is advisable. The president, 
who is now touring Russia's eastern regions, was ready to 
support the idea. 
  The problem of Baykonur is associated with the fact that 
following the break up of the former Soviet Union, the country's 
main space centre found itself on the territory of a "foreign 
country", the newly independent state of Kazakhstan. Russia is 
now using it under a temporary agreement with Kazakhstan but 
needs independence for pursuing its own space policy. The 
Russian space forces and other interested parties are now 
working to expand the space centre in the northern Plesetsk and 
looking for a suitable place for a new space centre in southern 
Russia capable of performing a number of functions which 
Baykonur alone can handle at present. 
  The Government of Russia has prepared a draft resolution "On 
the Development of the Cosmodrome in Plesetsk and the Creation 
of a Space Centre in the Far Eastern Region of the Russian 
Federation". 
  Svobodny-18, a former military settlement in the far east, 
is 
probably the best choice as it has a ramified infrastructure 
worth several hundreds of billions of rubles and its personnel 
trained to service combat missile complexes can be easily 
retrained to launch boosters with space craft. The new space 
centre would also create new jobs for the Amur-Baykal main line 
builders and local machine-builders. 
  Ahead of the full-scale development of the new space centre, 
a space equipment testing centre is already operating at 
Svobodny as part of the Russian space forces. Its specialists 
are preparing the launches of the Rokot boosters scheduled for 
1996.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 14 Jun -- The latest meeting of 
delegations from Georgia, South and North Ossetia, and 
representatives of the CSCE, aimed at continuing the search for 
peace and reconciliation, which began after the dialogue on 12 
May, took place in Vladikavkaz today on the initiative of the 
CSCE mission in Georgia. 
  The parties agreed in particular on the need to carry out 
joint work to stabilize the situation in the conflict zone, to 
fight organized crime, to restore road and rail traffic between 
Tskhinvali and other towns, to begin cooperating on economic 
revival, and to restore housing and the appropriate 
infrastructure. 
  The meeting participants agreed to help keep peace and law 
and order in the conflict zone by means of observation by the 
CSCE mission. There are proposals for the practical and legal 
basis to be created jointly for the speedy return of refugees 
and for an appeal to be made to the peacekeeping forces for the 
preparation of the necessary conditions to guarantee the 
refugees safety and also for enlisting the support of the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jun -- Speaking on behalf of the Chechen 
government of popular trust, its leader Yaragi Mamodayev today 
expressed his condolences to compatriots over the tragic events 
in Groznyy. Commenting on the latest developments to an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, he said: "This bloodshed shows that the 
process of self-annihilation of the Chechen people, against 
which our government has been warning everyone for a whole year, 
is exacerbating." Yaragi Mamodayev cited as evidence of this 
the fact that forces which, until quite recently, could in 
effect have been described as allies, for one reason or another 
clashed in Groznyy on 13 June. 
  According to Yaragi Mamodayev, more people have been killed 
in Chechnya since the first bloody conflict in June last year 
than in the open war in former Yugoslavia. The number of 
casualties in yesterday's tragedy was also several times higher 
than official figures suggest. 
  It is precisely because each day and each hour of the 
confrontation is claiming more human lives that our government 
once again urges the present Chechen leadership to seek 
reconciliation, not just in order to ensure peace for our 
compatriots, but for the sake of the very future of the Chechen 
people, Yaragi Mamodayev stressed.

  [Text] The Chechen opposition stated that from 180 to 300 
people had been killed as a result of the armed clashes in 
Grozny last Sunday. 
  The Chechen Interim Council, which opposites [as received] 
to 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said that innocent people had 
suffered during these clashes, including women and children. 
  Official authorities in Groznyy refuted this information 
saying that no more than ten people had been killed and no more 
than sixty wounded. 
  The armed clashes between government forces and the militant 
group of Ruslan Labazanov took place in a district of Groznyy. 
The clashes followed the order to disarm illegal armed 
formations in Chechnya issued by Chechen Military Commander 
Sultan Geliskhanov. 
  The opposition headquarters refuted the government statement 
that a wide-scale and decisive struggle against crime had begun 
in the republic. The opposition said that the Chechen 
leadership had started the bloodshed in order to eliminate the 
members of the armed group whom it had considered as supporters 
not so long ago. 
  The Interim Council said that opposition activist Labazanov 
was a witness to many criminal actions by the leadership. That 
is why the decision was taken to kill him, an opposition 
representative, who did not want his name to be revealed, went 
on to say. 
  Labazanov has managed to flee with a group of militants.

<F P=106> [Igor Yemelyanov report in the "Visit" column: </F>
"Zhirinovskiy in Volgograd. The LDPR Leader Moved in a Fast 
Track"] 
  [Text] On Sunday Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived in 
Volgograd from Krasnodar and, after rushing along in an armored 
Zil limousine under the protection of several police Opel cars, 
plunged into the friendly atmosphere of a banquet at the 
Oktyabrskaya hotel, where from 2200 to midnight he discussed how 
to set things going in Russia with the governor and the chief of 
the internal affairs administration. An official meeting next 
morning was held behind closed doors. The participants declined 
any comment. After taking a tour around the city and laying 
wreaths at several historical sites, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
proceeded to the central part of his visit: meeting with the 
Volgograd electorate. 
  Some 5,000 to 6,000 people turned up to marvel at the 
principal Liberal Democrat. Judging by their mood, many were 
disappointed after a two-hour mono-rally: There was none of the 
former criticism of present state rulers, with the main critical 
focus shifted to heads of ethnic provinces. 
  The LDPR leader's presentation on oblast TV proved to be 
richer in concept. On a highly topical issue Vladimir 
Zhirinovsky announced that Russian peacekeeping forces should 
not be introduced into Abkhazia and Karabakh but withdrawn from 
there as a matter of urgency and that weapons should be sold to 
those countries, "leaving them to straighten things out among 
themselves." 
  The next meeting with voters heard statements that it was 
only thanks to unflagging activity by the LDPR faction in the 
State Duma that six unamenable ministers had left the government 
and that it was only Zhirinovskiy's trip to Serbia that had 
helped Yeltsin and Kozyrev correctly to assess the situation and 
prompted the West to take a more cautious line with respect to 
former Yugoslavia. The LDPR leader spoke in sharp terms about 
the State Duma speaker, the president of Kazakhstan, and the 
communist leaders, and then jumped into the black Zil and rushed 
off. 
  Before his departure he expressed his confidence that not 25 
percent but 50 percent of the Volgograd electorate will vote for 
him in the upcoming elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleh Hrusdzilovich on a news conference by </F>
Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb; place and 
date not given: "The CIS Has Prospects. Stanislaw Bahdankevich 
Does Not Violate Laws"] 
  [Text] CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya and 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb, who returned 
from St. Petersburg, where they participated in the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, organized a news conference for 
journalists. 
  Myacheslaw Hryb opened the press conference with a joke 
saying that the journalists were so occupied with the 
presidential race that they almost forgot about the Supreme 
Soviet chairman. Myacheslaw Hryb assessed the agreements signed 
in St. Petersburg and answered a range of questions. The 
Supreme Soviet chairman was convinced that interest in him and 
his personal opinions on some pressing issues of our life did 
not decrease. We paid attention to five key questions which 
Myacheslaw Hryb had to answer: on CIS prospects, on the 
initiative -- regarding the creation of the Eurasian union -- of 
the Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev, on unexpected 
changes in prices for bread, and on National Bank Chairman 
Stanislaw Bahdankevich's recent moves. 
  "Our St. Petersburg meeting was very fruitful. In my 
opinion, work aimed at strengthening the CIS has sense, and the 
CIS has prospects," is how Supreme Soviet chairman answered the 
first question. Following are his words regarding Nazarbayev's 
initiative: "The president of Kazakhstan proposes two versions 
of the so-called Eurasian union -- mild and tough -- with which 
we should acquaint our society. What I like in this proposal is 
that it plans to set a union of states with equal rights. 
Under these conditions, the obligations of the allies would be 
more specified because the union does not foresee associate 
membership. In my opinion, this proposal does not run counter 
to the CIS. However, I would like to emphasize that the 
attitude of the CIS leaders toward this initiative is different. 
  "I think that we should not change the text of the 
Constitution," stated Myacheslaw Hryb regarding the monetary 
merger. He confirmed his earlier position which is that the 
state requires a tough Constitution because only such a 
constitution can be respected. Myacheslaw Hryb said that when he 
spoke earlier with president Yeltsin, they agreed that the 
fifth, and, probably, the eighth clauses of the agreement could 
be redrafted. However, the text of the agreement was submitted 
to Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin and work halted for a while. 
  As for the unexpected changes in prices for bread and some 
other foodstuffs, Myacheslaw Hryb said: "The government adopted 
this decision when I was in St. Petersburg. My personal opinion 
is that currently we cannot do without state management of the 
economy. The majority of enterprises are state-owned but the 
state cannot even affect the prices for products of these 
enterprises." 
  "We exercised juridical expertise regarding recent decisions 
adopted by the National Bank. It confirmed that everything was 
done within the limits of competence," said the Supreme Soviet 
chairman in reply to the last question. "As for Stanislaw 
Bahdankevich who adopted presidential candidate Stanislaw 
Shushkevich's proposal to head his `shadow' cabinet, this is his 
personal affair. By the way, former Interior Minister Yladzimir 
Yahoraw also joined the Shushkevich team and became his campaign 
manager. Well, this is their personal position."

<F P=106> [Statements by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw </F>
Antonavich Bahdankevich in response to questions submitted by 
NARODNAYA GAZETA readers; place and date not given: "I Am Ready 
To Cooperate With any Movements and Parties That Will Be Able To 
Implement the Program of Economic Reforms"] 
  [Excerpts] [A. V. Potyko] You travel abroad often, and I 
believe, not as tourist. Did you acquire any experience during 
your travels which could be of use for our Republic? What is 
your attitude toward IMF activities and its proposals regarding 
the resolution of our financial problems? 
  [Bahdankevich] I have often been abroad as Belarusian 
representative to the IMF and the World Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development [as published]. The IMF allots a considerable 
degree of technical aid to the Republic. It aids our banking 
system, primarily by teaching the basics of market economy to 
our personnel. As for the European Bank, our relations are most 
productive. This bank has already issued four lines of credit 
on very favorable conditions for us. We are conducting 
negotiations on some 20 investment projects and we have 
principally agreed on opening a credit line for small and 
medium-sized businesses. 
  [Samusev] It seems to me that the independence of the 
National Bank cannot be compared to that of any central bank in 
Europe. Your bank is forced to execute such measures which lead 
to increases in inflation and other negative consequences. 
Should you not reconsider the status of our National Bank? 
  [Bahdankevich] Not only the Belarusian National Bank but 
also 
other central banks are experiencing certain pressure from both 
their governments and national business circles in terms of 
issuing loans. 
  In our state, increases in inflation are primarily explained 
not by the issuing of credits but rather by a lack of market 
levers regulating the economy under situations whereby the state 
has refused to directly manage it. Of course, the independence 
of the National Bank should be encouraged. However, the key 
point is not in the juridical independence of the bank but in 
the stalling of reforms. [passage omitted] 
  [Zhuk] Kebich blames the nonimplementation of the monetary 
union with Russia on Bahdankevich. Who is correct? 
  [Bahdankevich] The National Bank has never opposed the 
preservation and strengthening of economic integration with the 
Russian Federation. We favor such a union, which is based on 
equal rights and does not destroy our independence. We do not 
agree that a foreign state -- even a friendly one -- should 
begin to formulate our economic policy. We oppose the transfer 
of the National Bank -- with its assets and liabilities -- to 
the ownership of another state; the approval of the Belarusian 
budget and the amount of its deficit by the Russian Duma; the 
recalculation of our banks' and enterprises' funds on the basis 
of an unprofitable-for-us exchange rate. [passage omitted] 
  [Nalivayko] What about the unification of the Belarusian and 
Russian monetary systems? Proceeding from the words of our 
prime minister, I can understand that if not today, then, at 
least, tomorrow, the Russian ruble will become our legal 
currency. However, you told NARODNAYA GAZETA that there is 
virtually no agreement at all. I trust more in your 
professionalism. The second question is whether Russia has set 
similar -- with its domestic market -- prices for energy 
resources for Belarus? 
  [Bahdankevich] Many factories and businesses in Belarus can 
work normally only when they have foreign markets for raw 
materials and can sell their products overseas -- primarily, in 
Russia and Ukraine. The preservation and extension of markets 
is always a positive rather than a negative factor. We kept 
this in mind when we planned to establish an equal banking union 
between two sovereign states based on a common currency. 
However, I think that the monetary merger -- one based on 
conditions which violate our Constitution and contradict our 
economic and political interests -- should not be implemented. 
Instead of the monetary merger, it is possible to sign an 
agreement on bilateral payments with Russia. I would like to 
emphasize that in early June, the Russian side sent an official 
proposal and a draft agreement -- regarding measures to provide 
for the mutual convertibility of our national currencies aimed 
at establishing a monetary union based on their national 
currencies -- to V. F. Kebich. This testifies to the fact that 
the Russian Government also has no illusions as far as the 
monetary merger -- based on inadmissible and contradictory 
conditions for the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- is 
concerned. 
  The Russian side has not even lifted customs duties and 
taxes, while we lifted them back in April. All the statements 
made by our government do not correspond to reality, to say the 
least. The Russian Government has already drawn up a draft 
agreement regarding customs duties and taxes. Proceeding from 
this document, these duties and taxes will be lifted beginning 
on the day it is signed. I believe that this agreement will be 
signed in the next few weeks. At the moment, our Republic is 
experiencing huge losses. 
  [Lisitskiy] I think that it is the Cabinet of Ministers, 
headed by Kebich, which has ruined our economy. However, Kebich 
blames the National Bank for this. What is wrong with your bank? 
  [Bahdankevich] The National Bank opposes injections of 
"noncovered" money into our economy. This leads to increases in 
inflation and prices, to decreases in the exchange rate of our 
ruble. To cover the money, the government should pursue a 
rational price policy. Currently, one liter of milk in a shop 
costs 180 rubles [R] while it costs R1,860 to produce. This 
difference is covered from the state budget. This money is mine 
and yours. We believe that the government should issue 
subsidies not to producers, but to consumers to enable them to 
buy milk or bread. It is the price that makes the economy 
function. This is the key contradiction between the National 
Bank and the government, which wishes -- how can I put this -- 
to lay the blame on someone else. [passage omitted] 
  [Samalyuk] Would the economic situation in Belarus become 
stable if a national currency were introduced? Who has a real 
chance of becoming president of Belarus? 
  [Bahdankevich] Currently, I would not make any 
recommendations as to changes in the National Bank payment notes 
for a national currency. To stabilize the economy, it is 
necessary to promptly reconstruct it. This means, first of all, 
setting conditions for competition, capital investment, cutting 
the budget deficit and number of uncovered loans. In my 
opinion, a decrease in the inflation rate and stabilization of 
the economy -- merely on the basis of a tough monetary policy 
along with the introduction of a national currency -- are 
impossible. 
  I hold out hope that the Belarusian people did not lose 
their 
common sense. They will elect a president who will attract the 
best creative forces to the leadership of the state and will 
count not on Western or Eastern tips, but on the diligence and 
creative potential of its own people. [passage omitted] 
  [Petrov] Kebich met with intelligentsia in Nesvizh. He spoke 
unfavorably of the "chief banker." Why? Is this because 
Bahdankevich does not want to issue loans to the agricultural 
sector or because he opposes the monetary merger with Russia in 
the form the prime minister signed it? Kebich said if the 
National Bank does not issue a loan to the government, the 
government will then take credits in dollars from abroad and 
give them to agricultural workers. Who will pay back those 
dollars? Kebich or the people? Why were two people -- one from 
the Supreme Soviet and another from the Cabinet of Ministers -- 
included on the National Bank board? Does this mean that 
Bahdankevich has to resign? 
  [Bahdankevich] Mildly speaking, Mr. Kebich lied in Nesvizh. 
This year, the National Bank did not grant credits to businesses 
or the government at a 210-percent, or even higher, interest 
rate. We earmarked R1 trillion in credits -- with a yearly 
interest rate of 6.5 percent -- for the sowing campaign through 
the budget. In addition, we extended credits for advance 
payments for state procurement of agricultural products with a 
yearly interest rate of 20 percent, for investments -- 60 
percent; for production requirements -- 100 percent. 
  As for the refusal to grant regular credits to the 
agricultural sector, the truth is that our Republic has created 
conditions for setting a constant breakaway gap between 
procurement prices for agricultural products and prices on 
industrial products for the agricultural sector. The more milk, 
grain, or meat a kolkhoz or sovkhoz produces, the more 
unprofitable it is. By not restricting prices on industrial 
products for the agricultural sector and simultaneously 
restricting procurement prices -- given the lack of funds to 
cover the breakaway gap in prices -- we push agricultural 
producers toward bankruptcy. The government sees salvation if 
the National Bank issues free and blank credits. However, this 
is the path to nowhere -- to a dead end. 
  The National Bank has repeatedly recommended that the 
government cover the carrying costs by setting prices and 
issuing credits to agricultural businesses only for seasonal 
work and stock provisions. This year, 97.2 percent of National 
Bank assets were injected into the agricultural-industrial 
complex [APK]. We expected the government to at least adopt the 
necessary measures. However, it has done nothing. 
  Any nonexperts -- industrial or agricultural sector workers 
-- realize that in addition to the APK, industry, transport, 
trade, and other sectors of economy also require state credits. 
A continuous imbalance in supporting only one sector will only 
intensify our problems. Prime Minister Kebich should render 
support to the agricultural sector, however, he should not do 
this by means of such highly unprofessional moves. 
  As for the introduction of the Supreme Soviet and the 
Cabinet 
of Ministers' representatives in our bank, this was done 
according to changes introduced to the Law on the National Bank. 
I am not going to resign in the immediate future. Not because 
I care for the chair and a high salary. Were I a chairman of a 
commercial bank, my salary would have been at least twice as 
high as my actual salary from the state. [passage omitted] 
  [Tolkachev] How much time, do you think, will be required to 
stabilize the economy once the economic reforms are implemented? 
What will cover and support the national currency? Western 
credits or land mortgages? Anything else? How do you view 
Kebich's desire to join the Russian Federation? 
  [Bahdankevich] I believe that at least to minimally 
stabilize 
the economy -- that is, to reduce the inflation rate to a level 
of less than 10 percent per month, to stabilize the exchange 
rate of the Belarusian ruble -- we require between six and eight 
months. After this issue is resolved, we will need between two 
and three years to profoundly reconstruct the economy, to stop 
the drop in production, and ensure a gradual increase in 
economic productivity. 
  As for the introduction of our national currency, the 
national wealth -- at first, Belarus-produced products, goods 
and services, given the tough budget and credit policy -- will 
guarantee its stability. 
  [Bahdankevich] I would not comment on Vyachaslaw 
Frantsevich's position, however, I do favor the preservation of 
Belarus' complete political sovereignty and close economic 
integration with the CIS states and our Western neighbors. 
[passage omitted]. 
  [Bakun] Why did you, Stanislaw Antonavich, not clarify your 
position -- regarding the union with Russia -- earlier? Why 
only now? Also, I'd like to know which presidential candidate 
you will vote for? 
  [Bahdankevich] According to our verbal agreement with 
Chernomyrdin, it was decided that the final draft of the 
agreement could be changed after the consultations. However, 
you know that Russia did not accept any changes and even 
toughened its position. Therefore, I not only had to publicly 
express my opinion but to write a letter -- which contained my 
principal disagreement with the merger on such conditions -- to 
the Supreme Soviet.... I will vote for Stanislaw Shushkevich. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Kholod] Do you have a program regarding the stabilization 
of 
our "hare" outside of the ruble zone? 
  [Bahdankevich] Yes. We have recently discussed key trends in 
the money and credit policy for 1994. This program has already 
been adopted. 
  [Kholod] However, the government is pushing the Republic 
toward the money merger. At the same time, you have adopted a 
program of measures aimed at stabilizing the national currency 
outside the ruble zone. Why is there no single opinion on the 
issue? 
  [Bahdankevich] Currently, the agreement with Russia is 
virtually not effective. The expectation that it would begin 
functioning leads to big losses due to chaos in calculations. 
The point is that the Russian ruble was balanced and accounted 
on par with the Belarusian ruble. We virtually decreased our 
assets by 10 times.... [passage omitted] 
  [Burmako] What do you, an expert, think about the economic 
concept of the Belarusian Popular Front? Will you cooperate 
with them if they come to power? 
  [Bahdankevich] I am ready to cooperate with any parties and 
movements that will be able to implement a program of market 
reforms.

  [Text] A conference of heads of state structures, 
concerned with CIS matters in presidential and governmental 
apparatuses as well as in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Defense of CIS countries, is being held in Minsk. This is the 
first meeting at such a high level, organized for the purpose of 
working out the methods for improving CIS activities and the 
furthering integration of CIS countries. 
  The conference participants, in particular, considered the 
possibility of creating an economic union and a mechanism for 
implementing this union. They also discussed the proposal of 
Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev to create the 
Euroasiatic Union which, as specific to the CIS, would enable 
integration of the CIS countries into a closer economic and 
political union, that is, to perform those functions which 
formerly were attributed to the CIS. Commenting on this, CIS 
Executive Secretary Ivan Karatchenya told our correspondent that 
"the CIS, as an intergovernmental organization, could not prove 
its value. Initially, the CIS played a huge part in disuniting 
the single empire. A civilized "divorce" without blood and war 
has been accomplished, and this gives credit to the CIS and its 
bodies. However, many people, having felt that economically 
this leads to a deadlock, began discussing the need for a union 
on a new basis. In the first place -- an economic union, in the 
second -- possibly, a political or military union, or some other 
type of union. The point is whether the current politicians and 
all of us are able to realize that we need to live together on 
one-sixth of the dry land. Regarding Nazarbayev's initiative -- 
the creation of closer integration with the CIS through a 
creation of supranational structures -- many people doubt 
whether state heads will concede to it. At least, in the near 
future. Regarding the reasons why many agreements within the 
CIS framework do not work or work rather feebly, they are of an 
objective nature: First, every country lives according to its 
own laws. Second, many agreements have been signed only by some 
CIS members. Finally, third, there are difficulties with the 
ratification of adopted documents by the parliaments of CIS 
countries. Not to mention other reasons, even Russia has not 
yet ratified the agreement on the economic union; this agreement 
is currently being discussed by the Federation Council and the 
Duma, and there is no single opinion on this issue."

  [Text] Chairmen of village soviets and district election 
commissions have held a conference at the Vileyka Rayon 
Executive Committee. The conference was also attended by 
Colonel G. Lisovskiy, military commissar of the Vileyka military 
registration and enlistment office. 
  According to Vladimir Alfer, chairman of the Vileyka rayon 
organization of the United Democratic Party of Belarus and 
campaign manager for Shushkevich, the military commissar began 
his address with a proposal to distribute submachine guns among 
the chairmen of district election commissions and to either keep 
election observers from political parties at gunpoint or drive 
them out and prevent them from meddling. Mr. Lisovskiy next 
stated that before 22 June all chairmen of village soviets are 
obliged to organize meetings of participants in the Great 
Patriotic War, during which he will present medals and money, as 
well as congratulations from Kebich on the occasion of the 50th 
anniversary of the liberation of Belarus. Responding to a remark 
from chairmen of village soviets, which proposed to attach this 
event to the celebration of the Republic's liberation, the 
military commissar stated that he has received an appropriate 
order in this regard from Defense Minister Kazlowski.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Popular Front leader, presidential candidate Zenon 
Pozniak believes that entire Belarus should be a free economic 
and banking zone. He hopes this would make his country a more 
attractive place for economic activity and create additional 
incentives for foreign banks and investment companies. 
  Pozniak's election platform says crucial to the success of 
economic reform would be all the makings of statehood -- 
borders, customs, national currency, banking system, bank of 
emission and the leverage to protect state sovereignty. 
  In the state sector the opposition presidential candidate 
suggests dividing the functions of power and property. Power 
will be vested with share-holders, holding companies and 
concerns, while property management will be handed over to the 
Property Management Ministry. 
  Pozniak believers that the share of military spending must 
be 
no bigger than 6 percent of the GDP. 
  New budget policies proposed by the Popular Front leader 
imply forming the budget from below -- from the level of local 
self-government, a stop to subsidizing producers, slashed 
spending on the state apparatus, appropriate financing of the 
law-enforcement, defence, the health service and the program to 
eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
disaster. 
  Pozniak believes that order in the economy would help quick 
transition to free trade in all goods and resources, which is to 
economic reform. Without making enterprises fully independent 
economically privatization, defence conversion or a social 
safety net for the population would be impossible. 
  In order to consolidate the national currency, whose 
functions will be performed at the first stage by a settlement 
bill of the National Bank the opposition presidential candidate 
suggests shifting all businesses to commercial operation, 
introducing a law on bankruptcies and another one on the state 
debt and procedures of forming and paying it, and enforcing 
anti-trust policies. 
  Pozniak says that the privatization of land is not the end 
but a means to enhance the effectiveness of the economy. 
  If elected president Pozniak promises to promptly set up 
rural mortgage banks to credit farm producers, build homes and 
social facilities. 
  In foreign economic policy Pozniak sees as a priority the 
development of partnership with neighboring countries and steps 
to conclude agreements with them on free trade, on customs and 
currency unions and, in the long run, a common market. He 
believes that monopoly in foreign trade must be abolished. 
  Pozniak blames the current economic crisis heavily on the 
government's strong reluctance to conduct an independent 
economic policy and the lack of political will in parliament to 
map out the way of the country's development. 
  In case of Pozniak's election victory a future Cabinet will 
be led by the leader of the Popular Accord Party Gennadiy 
Karpenko, Popular Front coordinator Pozniak's election campaign 
manager Sergey Naumchik. IF Note: Earlier Gennadiy Karpenko 
himself was a presidential candidate, however his team failed to 
raise 100 thousand signatures in his support necessary for 
official registration at the central electoral committee. Under 
Belarussian [Belarusian] legislation registration requires 
presenting to the central electoral commission the signatures of 
no less than 70 members of parliament. At first Karpenko was 
supported by 78 members of parliament, however, eleven of them 
-- the supporters of the Social Democrats -- changed their mind 
later. Karpenko withdrew from the election race without waiting 
for the central electoral committee's decision whether the 
law-makers had the right to take their signatures back. 
  PF coordinator described Karpenko's agreement to conclude a 
political alliance with Pozniak as another step towards the 
unification of right-wing forces. Naumchik said that Pozniak 
would benefit from the alliance with Karpenko at least because 
the Popular Accord Party leader has important political 
connections in Russia and enjoys certain credibility with 
influential Russian statesmen. 
  PF coordinator has told IF that Pozniak's alliance with the 
right-wing presidential candidate, ex-parliamentary speaker 
Stanislav Shushkevich would be impossible. Estrangement between 
the two will mount as the election race picks up pace, he said. 
  The coordinating committee of the Popular Movement of 
Belarus 
(PFB) has decided to support the current Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich as the common candidate of the left-center 
alliance in the 23 June presidential election. IF Note: PMB 
unites 30 left-wing and centrist parties and non-governmental 
organizations, such as the Communists, the Liberal Democrats, 
the Slavyanskiy Sobor (Slav Assembly) party, the Officers' Union 
and the republican organization of veterans. Analysts say that 
the movement have local offices in all districts and regions and 
is a major political force. 
  Apart from V. Kebich, Z. Pozniak and S. Shushkevich the 
Belarusian presidency is contested by three other candidates -- 
the Agrarian Party leader Aleksandr Dubko, Communist Party 
Secretary Vasiliy Novikov and people's deputy Aleksandr 
Lukashenko. The latter is faced with the risk of being excluded 
from the race for abusing the election law. IF Note: According 
to reliable sources a truck carrying 20,000 color photographs of 
Lukashenko and leaflets calling to vote for him was detained on 
the Latvian border on 10 June. The accompanying documents said 
the printed matter came from Hanover, Germany. The Belarusian 
election law prohibits any direct or indirect participation of 
foreign organizations or nationals in financing the campaigns of 
presidential candidates or giving them any other assistance. 
The central electoral commission is empowered to cancel the 
registration of those presidential candidates who prove 
responsible for violating this rule. 
  Although under the accompanying papers the cost of the cargo 
is estimated at 9 million Belarusian rubles, experts say that 
the real cost is more than 100 million. According the papers 
the customer paid the contractor in D-marks. 
  Interviewed by IF the chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission Aleksandr Abramovich has said that the commission was 
not empowered to decide whether Lukashenko should be banned from 
the race until law-enforcement agencies officially proved 
Lukashenko's complicity. 
  In the meantime reports from Minsk say that although the 
cargo was arrested, posters identical to those detained on the 
border appeared on the walls in the city center. Law 
enforcement agencies believe that similar cargoes arrived in 
Belarus earlier.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS 10/6/1994 -- Today, the 
presidential spokesman made a statement saying that the recent 
[8 June] declarations by the president and government of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic are biased presentations of 
the reality, states a presidential press service communique. 
Previously, the Dniester officials denounced Chisinau for 
jeopardizing the negotiations with Tiraspol. According to the 
spokesman, on 28 April, soon after the joint [Moldovan-Dniester] 
declaration, the Moldovan president formed a group of experts to 
design the draft law on a special juridical status for the 
Dniester region. The Dniester party did not create a similar 
group, as was agreed. An agreement stipulating the reparations 
of the two bridges across the Dniester was signed. Following 
this agreement, the Ministry of Transportation three weeks ago 
signed a contract with an Odessa company to repair the bridges. 
The Dniester party does not carry out its obligations, said the 
spokesman. He also said that a branch of the Moldovan National 
Bank was opened in Tiraspol and that Dniester companies are 
opening accounts in lei at the authorized banks. According to 
an agreement signed by the State Administration of Civil 
Aviation and the parallel Tiraspol department, actions are 
undertaken to satisfy the passengers. President Snegur is 
permanently informed of the undertakings and told the experts' 
group head, Nicolae Osmochescu, to inform Richard Samuel, head 
of the CSCE permanent mission to Moldova, and Vladlen Vasev, 
representative of Russian president. The presidential spokesman 
stated that "Mircea Snegur appreciates at its real value the 
document signed on 28 April and expresses once more his hope 
that the Dniester party will prefer to act and not merely talk 
in order to establish the peace and understanding unanimously 
longed for by the people of entire Moldova."

  [Text] Tiraspol -- The press service of the president and 
the Government of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye made a 
statement concerning the negotiating process with Moldova on the 
political status for Pridnestrovye. For the first time, as Mr. 
Smirnov, the president of the Moldavian Republic of 
Pridnestrovye, stressed, we saw a sincere desire of the Republic 
[of] Moldova to settle long existing problems. 
  Apart from the main document, some other agreements were 
signed. The agreement between the National Bank of Moldova and 
the central bank of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye, the 
protocol of intentions on the social order, fighting against 
crime and other documents. The sides, in particular, decided to 
start the negotiating process without delay and preliminary 
conditions on all the questions the sides are interested in, to 
remove all the obstacles that block normal economical, social 
and cultural relations, provide to [as heard] their restoration 
and development, normalize business, trade, and financial 
relations for mutual benefit in interest of the entire 
population. 
  The sides came to the conclusion that it was necessary to 
determine the political and legal status of Pridnestrovye -- a 
step by step program of creating and carrying on political and 
legal relations on division of powers between [the] sides and a 
transitional period for realization of mutual agreements on 
every concrete direction of activity. Finally, on the necessity 
of creation of the system with mutual guarantees, including 
international ones in order to fulfill the reached agreements 
completely and unconditionally. [sentence as heard] 
  More than a month has passed. However, attempts of the 
leadership of the Moldavian Republic of Pridnestrovye to speed 
up the (?status) activity, face once again a (?solid) blockade 
which we know pretty well. The president of the Republic of 
Moldova, Mircea Snegur, actually evades further development of 
the negotiating process, specifying no reasons of such a 
behavior to the leadership of Pridnestrovye. 
  Relations between Abkhazia and Georgia, other hot regions, 
have now more and more good prospects on the way proposed and 
adopted by Russia. Agreements signed by Russia and Tatarstan 
may also be a kind of pattern for further work. It is being 
proposed to borrow from the experience of relations between 
Crimea and Ukraine. However, they reject the accumulated 
experience in reference to our region. Relations between the 
Republic of Moldova and Pridnestrovye are being frozen 
artificially again. 
  The position of the leadership of the Moldavian Republic of 
Pridnestrovye remains the same. Only peaceful and negotiating 
activity can settle all the problems. Besides, we don't see any 
reasons for the artificial delay of the settlement of vital 
problems and coordinating the determination of the status for 
Pridnestrovye with the problems of Gagauzia. Expressing his 
concern about the nonfulfillment of the signed statement and the 
number of documents, the president of the Moldavian Republic of 
Pridnestrovye, Igor Smirnov, addressed Russia's resident 
plenipotentiary envoy to Pridnestrovye, (Vasiv), with the 
request to use all his influence on the president of the 
Republic of Moldova, Mircea Snegur, in order to speed up the 
negotiating process and the realization of the signed document.

  [Text] President Mircea Snegur today denied an allegation 
by Tiraspol authorities that the Moldovan leadership is blocking 
the continuation of talks started under Russian and CSCE 
mediation on the peaceful settlement of the Dniester conflict. 
  As already reported, Igor Smirnov, leader of the Dniester 
region, accused Chisinau last week of silently blocking the 
dialogue to settle the crisis. He appealed to Vladlen Vlasov, 
the Russian president's special envoy at the talks, requesting 
that the latter use his influence over Snegur who, in Tiraspol's 
view, is avoiding talks. 
  A statement issued today by an official representative of 
the 
president of Moldova says that the Republic's leadership has set 
up a group of experts to draft a bill on the special juridical 
status of the region on the left bank of the Dniester River. It 
has been ready to begin work for a long time, but Tiraspol is 
delaying setting up a similar group for joint work on the bill, 
as agreed during the meeting held at the end of April between 
the leaders of Moldova and the Dniester region.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS 10/6/1994 -- Yesterday, a new 
round of negotiations between the Moldovan and Romanian 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs on facilitating the traffic of 
passengers and goods was held in Galati [Romania], states a 
communique issued today by the two ministries. According to the 
communique, "the delegations emphasized that their governments 
had decided to implement the provisions of the Governmental 
Agreement signed on 21 August 1992, according to which the 
entrance and exit through all border crossing points for 
international traffic or small traveler's traffic will be 
permitted without restrictions on the basis of identification 
documents or other travel documents issued by recognized 
authorities of the two states." The consular offices in 
Leuseni-Albita and Ungheni-Ungheni will suspend their activity 
beginning 1 August 1994. The Moldovan delegation specified that 
the suspension of the consular offices will not affect the free 
traffic of Moldovan and Romanian citizens. "Responsible 
authorities agreed to cooperate to prevent illegal crossing of 
the Prut river by citizens of third countries, especially of 
those with high emigration trends," states the communique. It 
was decided that the deliveries of goods and humanitarian and 
cultural packages will have priority. It was also decided that 
beginning 15 July 1994, the Sculeni-Sculeni and Oancea- Cahul 
points will be used according to international regulations for 
travelers' traffic, and the Giurgiulesti-Galati point following 
international regulations for goods traffic. The 
Leuseni-Albita, Ungheni-Ungheni, Costesti-Stanca and 
Stoianovca-Falciu points will function according to the current 
program. It was decided that new passage points at 
Braniste-Stefanesti and Lipcani-Radauti Prut will be opened in 
the future, mentions the communique.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- The 9th round of 
Moldovan-Russian negotiations on the 14th Army's withdrawal from 
Moldova led the parties to agreement on all articles of the 
General Accord, except Article 2, told BASAPRESS Nicolae 
Osmochescu, Moldovan vice minister of foreign affairs and head 
of the Moldovan delegation to the negotiations. He pointed out 
that Article 2 deals with the term of the Russian troops' 
withdrawal and that the Moldovan delegation insisted on 31 
December 1995 or January 1996 as the deadline for the 
withdrawal. "This is Moldova's official position based on the 
judgments of our experts," said Osmochescu. According to him, 
Russia insists on a period of three years, arguing that the 
withdrawal will have to take place through the territory of a 
third country. Some information media have reported that Moscow 
will demand four years for the withdrawal of its troops. 
Osmochescu also mentioned that additional issues, such as the 
utilization of the Tiraspol airport and compensations for 
repatriating the Russian officers were discussed. The Moldovan 
delegation considers that these compensations can be covered 
from the money gained through the selling of the flats and 
houses freed by the Russian officers, and not from the budget. 
The Dniester Republic's representatives in the negotiations 
tried to claim their share of the 14th Army's property. These 
claims were not accepted either by the Moldovan or by the 
Russian delegations. The 10th round of negotiations will be 
held in Chisinau in July or August this year, said Osmochescu. 
Nicolae Turtureanu, the representative of the Moldovan Defense 
Ministry, did not take part in the negotiations. Concerning 
this, Osmochescu said that "it is not exceptional; a large part 
of the Moldovan delegation had to be renewed." The head of the 
military delegation was Vasile Grosu, head of the Artillery 
Direction of the Moldovan Defense Ministry.

  [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- A meeting of the 
Union of Veterans of the Afghanistan War was held yesterday in 
Tiraspol. The meeting was attended by representatives of the 
Afghanistan war veterans' unions of Moldova, Ukraine, and 
Russia. The participants criticized the Tiraspol authorities 
for leaving the veterans and the families of Afghanistan war 
victims without social protection. Aleksandr Karaman, the vice 
president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic declared at 
the meeting that due to a very severe economic situation, when 
internal production has fallen by 26 percent, the leadership of 
Tiraspol is forced to make cuts in some social assistance 
programs. Aleksandr Lebed, the commander of the 14th Russian 
Army [currently stationed in Dniester], who also took the floor, 
declared that the leadership of Dniester is made up of swindlers 
who pretend that certain social organizations, including the 
Union of Afghanistan War Veterans, are taking an active part in 
the political life -- especially in the future elections to the 
leadership [sentence as received]. The meeting adopted a 
declaration which announces its intention to take part actively 
in the political life and future elections.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 10/6/1994 -- "The exaggerated 
tendency of the governing party to control all spheres of 
activity reveals its aspiration to return to the period and 
standards when Article 6 of the Constitution (on the role of the 
Communist Party) was the foundation," states a declaration of 
the Council of the Democratic Labor Party of Moldova (PDMM), 
published today by the newspaper GLASUL NATIUNII (VOICE OF 
NATION.) According to the declaration, "the policy pursued in 
the spiritual sphere has become aggressive; a total reversal of 
what was achieved during 1992 and 1993 is taking place here." 
The massive firing of democratic journalists, the 
monopolization of television and radio, and the regulation of 
the official press proves that the media financed by the entire 
population is becoming a slave to the interests of a single 
party, states the declaration. The PDMM says that "the 
extension of the results of parliamentary elections over local 
administration bodies is a grave transgression of the 
Constitution. Through presidential decrees of Mircea Snegur, the 
results of the 1990 elections for local administrative bodies 
are practically annulled. The dismissal of some mayors and 
chairmen of district executive committees is an abuse of the 
authorities and a serious violation of the millions of voters' 
interests expressed in the elections that no one annulled." The 
PDMM considers that the results of the presidential elections of 
1991 are put in question as the sole candidate, Mircea Snegur, 
did not represent any party. "The PDMM informs the CSCE 
representatives, the Council of Europe, foreign embassies, and 
all political movements in this country and abroad about the 
dangerous trends in the conduct of the current Moldovan 
leadership." The declaration also states that the party will 
"use in the future all legal means to prevent the real threat of 
restored totalitarianism and obscurantism in our country," 
concludes the declaration.

<F P=106> ["Decree of the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan on </F>
additional measures to ensure legality and law and order" -- 
KAZTAG headline] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- The low effectiveness 
of the measures being taken by bodies of state power and the 
administration to ensure legality and law and order on the 
territory of the Republic is creating serious obstacles to 
socioeconomic transformations and defense of the constitutional 
rights of citizens. 
  (?Especially) dangerous is the continuing growth in 
organized 
crime, corruption, embezzlement, and abuse by officials. Crimes 
committed with the use of firearms are spreading. There are 
considerable shortcomings in the organization of the work of law 
enforcement agencies. 
  With the aim of further strengthening legality, law and 
order, and discipline, and of ensuring the personal and property 
security of citizens, I decree: 
  1. To indicate to the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan and to local representative and executive bodies 
the untimely and ineffective implementation of the requirements 
of the acts of the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan on 
matters of the fight against crime and defense of the 
constitutional rights of citizens. To oblige officials of the 
state administration bodies to take exhaustive measures to 
strengthen legality and law and order in the Republic. To warn 
heads of ministries, state committees, and departments and heads 
of local administrations about their personal responsibility for 
ensuring public order and the safe-keeping of state property. 
  2. The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan is 
to: 

  -  Review the progress of carrying out the state program of 
priority measures in the fight against crime and strengthening 
law and order in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 1993-95 and take 
measures to invigorate the work being done. By 1 August 1994 
present proposals on making amendments and additions to the 
above program; 
  -  Draw up and by 1 September 1994 confirm 
government programs to fight drunkenness, alcoholism, and drug 
addiction [passage indistinct] 
  -  Work out an effective mechanism 
for transferring to law enforcement agencies the transport and 
technical property seized and confiscated by court order, and 
also part of the compensation paid for criminal damage. 

  3. The Council for Combatting Crime of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan is to hear reports from the Ministry of Justice, the 
Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Press and Mass 
Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan on work in legal 
education and training of citizens, propaganda, and explanation 
of legislation and legal policy among the population and raising 
the role of the mass media in the business of instilling respect 
for the law. 
  4. The General Public Prosecutor's Office, the Interior 
Ministry, the National Security Committee, and the Committee on 
State Finance Control under the Cabinet of Ministers of the 
Republic of Kazakhstan are to step up their work to control the 
following issues in order to expose and suppress abuses and 
other violations of legality: 

  -  To observe the order for issuing licenses giving the right 
to export goods, products, and raw materials from the republic, 
and implement the established rules on hard currency operations 
by export enterprises; 
  -  To check the validity of state property 
sales during the process of privatization which is taking place; 
ensure that all the money is received into special accounts; and 
check that the conditions for sale, exchange, and granting for 
temporary use are correctly observed, and that state enterprises 
borrow their main funds correctly; 
  -  To create various 
entrepreneurial structures under state enterprises, 
organizations, and establishments, and prevent any possible use 
of state money and resources for a wrong purpose; 
  -  To ensure that 
the state hard currency funds aimed at restructuring and 
modernizing industry and purchasing a limited range [words 
indistinct] important goods is correctly spent; 
  -  To ensure that 
state, joint-stock, and private banks observe legality and 
established economic norms during the giving of credits and 
loans, and in cash turnover, as well as in the use of state 
credit resources and the cash funds of legal entities. 

  5. The heads of the Republic's enterprises, organizations, 
and establishments are obliged to immediately consider and take 
measures in accord with presentations and directions of law 
enforcement agencies to eliminate any causes and conditions 
which could allow labor team members to violate the law or make 
criminal encroachments on cash funds, goods, or material 
valuables, regardless of the type of ownership. 
  The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan is to 
submit for consideration by the Supreme Soviet of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan a draft law envisaging greater responsibility on 
the part of authorities for violations of this matter. 
  6. There will be an amnesty for those members of the 
population who voluntary surrender by 1 September 1994 any 
firearms, ammunition, or explosives they may be illegally 
possessing. 
  Citizens who voluntarily hand in weapons, ammunition, or 
explosives will not be subject to the penalties laid down by the 
law. 
  The full weight of the law will apply to those who do not 
comply with this. 
  The Justice Ministry, together with the General Public 
Prosecutor's Office and the Interior Ministry of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, shall submit for consideration of the Cabinet of 
Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan a draft law to increase 
the penalties for carrying, keeping, purchasing, making, or 
selling weapons, ammunition, or explosives. 
  7. The General Public Prosecutor's Office of Kazakhstan, 
together with the Interior Ministry and the National Security 
Committee, should by 1 August 1994 examine the maintenance of 
standard issues, ammunition, and explosives in units and 
subdivisions subordinate to the Defense Ministry, the main

leaders of all ranks and dismiss those not appropriately 
fulfilling their obligations concerning the protection of the 
constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens, and the 
strengthening of law and order. 
  9. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan and 
the heads of local administrations, with the participation of 
the Interior Ministry of the Republic of Kazakhstan, should set 
up a taxation militia in accordance with the temporary 
resolution endorsed by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan. 
  The Justice Ministry of the Republic of Kazakhstan, together 
with interested ministries and departments, should elaborate and 
submit for consideration to the Cabinet of Ministers a draft law 
on a taxation militia. 
  10. The Transport and Interior Ministries and the heads of

December 1992 increasing the responsibility of officials and 
state power organs for the state of discipline, public order, 
and safety, and Resolution N1562 of the President of Kazakhstan 
of 11 February 1994 intensifying the battle against crime should 
be regarded as no longer valid. 
  [signed] President of Kazakhstan [Nursultan] Nazarbayev.

  [Text] Kiev--Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk signed an 
agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the 
European Union on 14 June in Luxembourg. He also signed a 
provisional agreement on the enactment of the main agreement 
while it awaits ratification by the parliaments of the 16 [as 
received] EEC members states. In a comment on the event, 
Natalya Zaruda, head of the Department for Strategic Analysis 
and Prognosis of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said 
that the agreement on partnership and cooperation between 
Ukraine and the EEC creates a mechanism for constant political 
dialogue and periodic consultations at different levels covering 
the entire range of political, economic, and cultural issues. 
  Ukraine and the EEC intend to cooperate in a stage-by-stage 
transition to greater freedom of movement for goods, services, 
and capital. In this connection, the agreement stipulates that 
Ukraine and the EEC discuss before 31 December 1998 the 
possibility of setting up a free trade zone between the European 
Community and Ukraine. The document also contains and agreement 
to hold regular meetings between top officials within the 
framework of the Joint Cooperation Council and to maintain 
contact within the Committee for Parliamentary Cooperation. 
  The agreement is also regarded as an expression of the EEC's 
support for Ukraine's intention to join GATT. Ukraine and the 
European Commission will soon begin negotiations on setting up a 
contact group on coal and steel and on trade in nuclear 
materials.

  [Excerpts] The signature of the agreement on partnership 
and cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union took 
place in Luxembourg on 14 June. This was an announcement made 
at a briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry. [passage 
omitted] 
  Speaking at the ceremony of signing the document, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk said the agreement was laying a 
qualitatively new legal foundation of our state's inclusion in 
European integrational processes. As well as being a matter of 
fundamental priority, he underlined, Ukraine's accession to 
European economic and political structures is a logical and 
necessary course of its external policy at the present stage. 
  The Ukrainian president added that the single Europe would 
also benefit a lot from cooperation with Ukraine in terms of the 
availability of transit roads across the territory of Ukraine, 
rich deposits of raw materials, and tens of millions of highly 
skilled workers. 
  If the boat of the Ukrainian state is rocked loose, Kravchuk 
warned, it can become a potential source of instability on the 
continent.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk arrived in 
Luxembourg today on a one-day working visit, following meetings 
there on Monday [13 June] and Tuesday of the European Union's 
Council of Foreign Ministers. Also today, he signed an 
agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the 
European Union. 
  The document confirms that the EEC member-states will 
support 
Ukraine as a sovereign and independent state within its existing 
borders. The agreement lays down the principles of, and a 
mechanism for, a permanent political dialogue between Ukraine 
and the EEC and systems of periodic consultations at different 
levels on the entire range of political, economic, cultural, and 
other issues. 
  The agreement also provides a qualitatively new basis for 
economic relations between Ukraine and the European Union on 
market economy principles. The sides will grant each other most 
favored nation status in trade, and will lift import 
restrictions with regard to trade agreements in coal, metal, and 
nuclear materials. Ukraine will also be able to sell its textile 
products on the European market. 
  The sides urge employers to lift discriminatory restrictions 
on employment of the partner country's citizens and ensure that 
the citizens' pension rights are preserved. 
  National terms are granted to European Union companies 
functioning on Ukrainian territory and with regard to access of 
trade ships to each side's ports. 
  The Ukraine and Luxembourg foreign ministers signed an air 
transport agreement. 
  The Chernobyl aid package to ensure complete shutdown of 
this 
nuclear plant and the safety of others will be finally agreed 
before the G-7 Summit in Naples. Leonid Kravchuk confirmed 
Kiev's consent to shut down the Chernobyl reactors if the 
international community assists Ukraine in this matter.

<F P=106> [Article by Viktor Nesterovich, RIA-NOVOSTI special </F>
correspondent specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The Crimean 
Knot"] 
  [Text] Simferopol-Moscow -- The situation on and around 
the peninsula is being normalized, but no fundamental changes in 
the various sides' positions have occurred. Confrontation may 
nevertheless be resolved through talks. 
  Claims that the situation in and around Crimea are now being 
normalized are unfortunately not true. In fact there has only 
been a drop in tension. Kiev and Simferopol have moderated the 
belligerent tone of their statements and have begun talking less 
about direct confrontation and conflict between the military 
units and other force structures on the peninsula. However, no 
fundamental changes in the various sides' positions have 
occurred. 
  The Republic of Crimea authorities are acting on the basis 
of 
the restored Constitution of 6 May 1992, which gives them 
extremely wide-ranging powers to resolve the peninsula's 
internal problems. As far as mutual relations with Ukraine are 
concerned, in the Crimean authorities' opinion there are no 
insoluble problems here. The Constitution clearly notes that 
Crimea is part of Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine is pointing to 
the incompatibility of this document with its own Fundamental 
Law. However, the Crimean authorities' everyday activities are 
being described by the Republic's capital as separatism dictated 
by a desire to leave the Ukrainian state. 
  In this confrontation President Yuriy Meshkov and the 
Crimean 
Supreme Council are relying on the unconditional support of an 
overwhelming majority of the population, which unequivocally 
gave its opinion on this issue in the poll of 27 March this 
year. Therefore, a comparison between Crimea and Bosnia is at 
the very least improper. 
  Regarding the Crimean Tatars, who, as was stated in the 
Assembly of the Crimean Tartar People, now comprise 
approximately 10 percent of the Crimean population, their 
pro-Ukrainian sympathies have their limits. 
  Today, all Crimea's influential political forces as 
represented in the republic's Supreme Council are stressing that 
they do not oppose incorporation into Ukraine, but only for the 
establishment of mutual relations with Kiev on a treaty basis 
[sentence as published]. The demarcation of the two side's 
powers should be defined as a result of negotiations. But 
nobody in Simferopol or Kiev knows when these talks will begin. 
For the time being the delegations from Supreme Councils of 
Ukraine and Simferopol [as published] have only managed to 
secure agreement on establishing a working group of experts 
which by 15 June are required to submit to the Crimean 
parliament their recommendations for eliminating inconsistencies 
between the constitutions and other legislative organs [as 
published] of Crimea and Ukraine. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov, vice prime minister and leader of the 
Crimean Council of Ministers, believes that the present process 
of talks between Kiev and Simferopol will begin after the 
presidential election in Ukraine. At the present time, serious 
talks between the two sides are impossible, because Crimea is 
one of the main topics of the election campaign. Nevertheless, 
he believes, Kiev will sooner or later arrive at a federative 
structure, bearing in mind that several more regions of the 
country are striving for greater autonomy within Ukraine. 
  For the time being, however, Kiev has practically reached 
the stage of imposing economic sanctions on Crimea. Emissions of 
finance to the peninsula have been suspended, which in the 
inflationary conditions that exist in Ukraine may certainly be 
regarded as a sanction. The construction of a water pipeline to 
Simferopol, where people can obtain water for just one hour 
every day, has been halted. Saburov also regards the policy of 
whipping up tension around Crimea as an element of the sanctions 
campaign, which has practically wrecked the tourist season. It 
represents a direct undermining of Crimea's economic base and an 
attempt to prevent revenue from reaching the Crimean budget. 
Sanatoriums in the greater Yalta area, for example, are only 30 
percent full, which right now means they are only just managing 
to survive. 
  It has not been ruled out that the situation will sorted 
out, 
that a normal talks process will be established between Kiev and 
Simferopol, and that the two sides will succeed in overcoming 
all their disagreements, primarily their deep suspicion of one 
another. In my view, this is currently the main obstacle on the 
path to finding a compromise. 
  As debates in the Ukrainian parliament regarding Crimea have 
shown, in this complex situation Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk] 
has successfully demonstrated his political skill and managed to 
secure the most advantageous position in the election campaign. 
He has been greatly helped in this task by the national 
radicals. Particularly useful, for example, has been the remark 
by Vice Admiral Vadim Kozhin, former Ukrainian Navy commander, 
who not only demanded the immediate imposition of presidential 
rule and martial law in Crimea, but also the withdrawal of the 
Russian Black Sea Fleet from the peninsula within 24 hours. 
Against this background, in the eyes of Ukrainian public 
opinion Leonid Makarovich looks like a serious and responsible 
politician who, while concerned for the unity of Ukraine as a 
power, is not ruling out other, more strong-arm methods of 
resolving the Crimean problem. 
  But the danger of a sharp deterioration of the situation in 
Crimea is possible even in the absence of any political 
complications. In an interview he gave to me, Colonel General 
Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security 
Service, who has been stationed in Crimea for a considerable 
length of time, put forward the idea of establishing a working 
group under the Crimean Supreme Council to clarify possible 
misunderstandings between the troops stationed on the peninsula. 
General Vladimir Lepekhov, head of the Republic of Crimea 
Security Service, basically agrees with this proposal. 
  Malikov believes that the situation in Crimea became acute 
in 
May because of, among other things, the lack of coordination 
between various military units which during that period were -- 
in accordance with Soviet tradition -- checking out the training 
which troops had received for the winter and spring period. 
There are more than enough troops in Crimea: The Black Sea 
Fleet, which includes a coast defense division and brigade of 
marines, naval units, a motorized rifle corps, a brigade of the 
Ukrainian National Guard, and in addition to this, the Crimean 
militia, which is subordinate to the Republic of Crimea 
Government. This whole mass of armed men is concentrated in a 
very restricted space; they are often practically on top of one 
another. 
  Nor should we ignore the various special services. According 
to my incomplete data, there are over 10 Ukrainian, Russian, and 
Crimean organizations of this sort operating at various levels 
in Crimea. 
  A mundane misunderstanding or fateful combination of 
circumstances is all it would take to trigger an uncontrollable 
sequence of events whose consequences would be simply impossible 
to predict. A powder keg cannot be kept in a fire-risk zone 
forever. Some day it will all go up in a ball of flames. 
  Therefore, alongside talks between Crimea and Ukraine on 
normalizing their mutual relations, and between Russia and 
Ukraine on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, a no less important 
task is the establishment of a kind of coordinating center 
comprising representatives of the power structures operating in 
Crimea. This center should at the very least coordinate the 
activity of power departments and provide the civilian 
authorities and the public with prompt information about all 
uncoordinated actions and misunderstandings between these 
departments. The situation will not deteriorate as a result of 
this. On the contrary, trust will develop between the various 
sides involved in the conflict, the people of Crimea will at 
last be able to breathe more freely, and the number of people 
deciding to vacation by the Black Sea will undoubtedly increase.

  [Text] Ukraine does not support Russia's intention to seek 
a special status within the framework of NATO' Partnership for 
Peace program, the chief of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's 
political analysis department, Igor Kharchenko, told IF. 
  In reply to a question from the INTERFAX-Ukraine news agency 
Kharchenko said that "practically all member-countries were 
against any advantages being granted to any country involved in 
that program, contrary to statements by Russian politicians that 
Russia's opportunities were far wider than those of other 
countries." 
  Kharchenko said that Russia's relations with NATO were 
crucial to European security. 
  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry official said that Ukraine 
was 
conducting "a consistent policy in order to take a decent place 
in the system of collective European security and not to drift 
either eastwards or westwards."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Kyrgyzstan will have to remain outside the big 
economy for many years, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev said last 
weekend during the conference `Kyrgyzstan is our single house' 
in Bishkek. 
  He believes that Kyrgyzstan was in an unfavorable 
geo-political situation since it had no access to the sea or 
other "trade communications." Akayev underlined that in the 
near future the Republic would depend on the neighboring 
countries, especially on Russia since Kyrgyzstan along with the 
whole Central Asian region was not in the sphere of interests of 
the economically developed countries. 
  Akayev suggested that no serious foreign investments were 
likely to be attracted by the industrial potential of Kyrgyzstan 
since the Republic was failing to maintain the industrial 
infrastructure. "Since Kyrgyzstan has no other choice, the 
government has to suspend activities of many enterprises," 
Akayev said. 
  Akayev emphasized that foreign investors were not eager to 
place their money to the Kyrgyz economy since they were lacking 
political stability in Kyrgyzstan and guarantees. "That is why 
it is hard to believe that the rating of Kyrgyzstan as a 
developing country will go up in the near ten or fifteen years," 
Akayev regretted. 
  He was sure that the economic and social problems 
experienced 
by Kyrgyzstan could be overcome only through cooperation with 
Russia. The main point here is to enhance the economic relations 
and mutually beneficial industrial cooperation with Russia. 
However, he had to stress that the trade and economic relations 
between the two countries were decreasing and coming to a 
critical point. (INTERFFAX Note: Before 1992 the trade turnover 
between Kyrgyzstan and Russia was 70 pct of the whole volume of 
that for Kyrgyzstan. In the first quarter of 1994 it 
significantly went down. Russia found itself in the third place 
after Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.) 
  Akayev suggested that a joint Kyrgyz-Russian holding company 
must be created with the authorized capital of 30 billion or 50 
billion Russian rubles. The company would focus on restoration 
of the bilateral trade and economic and industrial relations. 
  Akayev thought that the company must be accumulating money 
resources and ensure participation of Russian citizens in 
privatization in Kyrgyzstan. The company must also be carrying 
out trust operations with the real estate of the population 
leaving the Republic and contributing to development of the 
small and average business by Russian-speaking citizens. The 
company could also be organizing mass travel tours to Kyrgyzstan 
by Russian tourists. 
  Akayev regretted that Russia had not as yet responded to his 
proposals stated in 1993. 
  The Kyrgyz president also pointed out that since industrial 
relations with Russia were being broken the number of Russians 
migrating was increasing, especially of Russians working at 
industrial enterprises. 
  Akayev said that the emigration of Russia-speaking 
population 
was a catastrophe not only for Kyrgyzstan but also for Russia 
since it was difficult to receive hundreds of thousands of 
Russians coming from Kyrgyzstan. (INTERFAX Note: In 1990 there 
were about 918,000 Russians in Kyrgyzstan (21.2 pct of the 
Kyrgyz population). On 1 April 1994, there were about 750,000 
Russians living in Kyrgyzstan (17 pct). For the first time in 
the Soviet and post-Soviet time in Kyrgyzstan the total number 
of the Kyrgyz population has decreased due to the migration by 
Russians. Currently, there are about 4.4299 million people 
living in Kyrgyzstan (the number fixed on 1 January 1994). This 
is 40,000 people fewer that it was on 1 January 1993.) 
  Akayev pointed out that the departure of Russian specialists 
was doing a significant harm to the Kyrgyz economy. 
  Kyrgyz experts consider the deteriorating economic situation 
in Kyrgyzstan as the main reason for migration. Russian experts 
see social and political reasons as essential, Akayev said. For 
instance, Russian experts believe that the transition to the 
Kyrgyz language as the official one was forcing Russians out of 
many spheres. There were certain cases of discrimination in the 
sphere of entrepreneurship and of nationalism in everyday life 
which were not neither encouraged nor condemned by the official 
authorities. Akayev stressed he would listen to such conclusions 
by Russian experts. 
  However, Akayev categorically disagreed that Russians in 
Kyrgyzstan had no future. He said such suggestions had no 
ground and must not be admitted. 
  Commenting on the problem with the migration, Akayev said 
that its settlement would also depend on participation of Russia 
since Kyrgyzstan could not resolve all the problems on its own. 
  Akayev regretted that the proposal to adopt a declaration on 
the rights of ethnic minorities stated at the recent CIS summit 
had been put aside. 
  Akayev was certain that all ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan 
must have a quota in the parliament and in the local bodies. He 
thought that the Russian language must be made the official one 
in the regions mostly populated by Russians. Akayev spoke in 
favor of dual citizenship for Russians. 
  The Kyrgyz president suggested that the issue on dual 
citizenship could be solved following the example of the 
European Union after the Maastricht treaty. 
  Akayev refuted the allegations that he could not make an 
independent decision on this issue as a president. He just 
stressed that in accordance with the Constitution the issues on 
dual citizenship and state languages must be decided upon by the 
parliament. 
  Akayev said he could not confront the parliament which 
mostly 
was not in favor of adopting such decisions. The president 
believes that it is necessary to work with the public opinion 
before these problems be settled. 
  During a meeting with the heads of the local administration 
on Monday Akayev emphasized his intention to strengthen the 
state power. 
  He made it clear that the point was not to alter the general 
policy but to review the former concepts which had proved 
themselves illusory and inadequate. The new realities make 
change the guidelines. 
  Akayev stressed that he remain a faithful supporter of 
democracy. However, he believes that life has shown democratic 
means as inefficient and hindering implementation of the reforms. 
  There is no alternative to a strong state power in the 
Republic since the people were not ready for democratic 
self-rule, Akayev said. 
  The Kyrgyz president stated that he would remove everybody 
who would hamper implementation of state decisions and the 
program of the structural reorganization of the economy planned 
for the next three years. 
  Akayev said many people wanted a tough authoritarian regime 
to be established in the Republic similar to that in other CIS 
states. However, in his opinion, this would bring no results. 
  Akayev suggested that the parliamentarianism in Kyrgyzstan 
had made the Supreme Soviet get involved with political and 
criminal investigations rather than perform its legislative 
functions. The parliament had become a substitute for the state 
committee on security, the Interior Ministry and the courts 
which was frightening potential investors. 
  "Many people in Kyrgyzstan have regarded the parliament as 
an 
apotheoses of democracy. However, the activities of the present 
parliament are braking the reforms and create such a reputation 
to Kyrgyzstan, which makes it look as a scandalous country," 
Akayev said.

  [Text] The Russian language will be considered as a state 
one in Kyrgyzstan's regions mostly populated by the 
Russian-speaking population, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev 
stated in his decree, which he read out during a meeting with 
the Slav community on Tuesday [14 June] in Bishkek. 
  Akayev said the decree had been issued in order to prevent 
further growth in the number of the Russian-speaking people 
emigrating from Kyrgyzstan. 
  The Kyrgyz Government will try to ensure equal 
representation 
of the Slav community in the state and local administration. 
  The decree also provides for guaranteed representation of 
the 
ethnic minorities in all state power bodies. Within a month the 
Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry will work out proposals on the 
acquisition of citizenship for Russian-speaking inhabitants of 
Kyrgyzstan leaving for Russia and for those willing to come back 
to Kyrgyzstan from Russia. The proposals will be coordinated 
with the Russian party. 
  The Kyrgyz Interior Ministry and the National Security 
Committee will strengthen their struggle against nationalism. 
  Akayev suggested that the migration by the Russian-speaking 
population was causing large damage to the potential of 
Kyrgyzstan on the whole. He emphasized that increasing 
migration was due to the problems with the language, 
insufficient representation in the state bodies and other 
official structures and the display of nationalism in everyday 
life. 
  Akayev announced that he had prepared one more letter to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin asking Russia to help Kyrgyzstan 
to resolve the economic problems. Akayev stressed that these 
issues must be settled urgently if Russia was interested in 
ensuring the position of Russians living in Kyrgyzstan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Mainayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek 15 June TASS -- Kirghizian [Kyrgyzstan] 
President Asker Akayev has issued a decree on "measures to 
regulate migration processes from the Republic of Kirghizia" 
today in his bid to stop or at least beat down the wave of the 
Russian-speaking population's migration from the Republic. 
  The document demands to make Russian an official language 
together with the Kirghiz language in areas predominantly 
populated by Russian-speaking people. According to the head of 
state's instructions, it is necessary to do it in all vital 
branches of the country's economy, where the use of achievements 
of science and technology is linked with the use of the Russian 
language, such as public health, mathematics and technical 
sciences. 
  The decree instructs the government to extend the transition 
timetable set for the use of the national language in business 
correspondence, and secure a just representation of the 
Russian-speaking population in state structures from the highest 
to the lowest rung. 
  The Foreign Ministry has been instructed to coordinate a 
simplified procedure of receiving the Russian and regaining the 
Kirgiz citizenship with corresponding departments of the Russian 
federation. 
  This document concludes with a decisive demand from the law 
enforcement bodies to intensify combatting all kinds of 
manifestations of nationalism. 
  Among noteworthy "achievements" of documents, decisions and 
decrees issued during the past few years are either their slow 
implementation or their existence only on paper. For example, 
the preceding decree on the change over to the use of the 
Kirghiz language in business correspondence has almost been 
neglected. 
  The latest decree, which runs counter to the Constitution 
adopted on 5 May 1993, might become a restraining factor for the 
migration, and unite the opposition. More so, because almost 
all structures of power have become multi-national during the 
past three years. Decisive reshuffles of the personnel, as 
demanded by the presidential decree, may be sabotaged and 
eventually undermine Kirghizia's economy which is already living 
through a deep crisis.

  [Text] There is a natural gas problem in Kyrgyzstan again. 
RIA was told by the government's press service that debt for 
gas to neighboring Uzbekistan currently amounts to approximately 
10 million U.S. dollars. The lion's share of that sum consists 
of the debts of the Republic's industrial sector due to its 
insolvency. The government and local administrations are also 
unable to subsidize gas consumption for the private sector. 
Kyrgyz authorities have been instructed to review gas charges 
with a view toward raising them, as a solution to a situation in 
which Uzbekistan may, at any moment, turn off the tap of natural 
gas supplies.

  [Text] Baku, June 14 (TURAN) -- Azerbaijan's Prime 
Minister, Suret Guseynov, issued a protest against Judge Shahin 
Rustamov, who is presiding over the trial on the case of June 
events of 1993. 
  The Premier sent the letter to the Judicial Collegiate, 
which 
is examinining the crimes committed in the city of Ganja on June 
4, 1993, with a request to remove Shahin Rustamov, as concerned 
person, from his duties. 
  Suret Guseynov, who is testifying as a witness to the Ganja 
events, said that Rustamov was appointed Chairman of the 
Judicial Collegiate of Azerbaijan's Supreme Court by the former 
Chairman of the Parliament, Isa Gambar [Kamberov] who is himself 
presently on trial. Suret Guseynov also states that Shahin 
Rustamov was appointed to this office as an active leader of the 
PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan]. 
  Shahin Rustamov was himself involved in the process because 
following the June events he was stripped of his duties as 
Chairman of the Judicial Collegiate of the Supreme Court. 
  The trial concerning the Ganja events began on April 29 and 
has since been developing in an unfavorable direction. 
  As was earlier reported, on June 4, 1993 an armed conflict 
arose between the motor-infantry brigade headed by Suret 
Guseynov and govermental troops under the President Elchibey. 
  This accident inflicted a defeat on the Popular [People's] 
Front of Azerabijan.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("YERKIR" daily - Haylur), 06/14/94 -- A 
"Haylur" correspondent met Acting Chairman of the RMK [Republic 
of Mountainous Karabakh] Supreme Council Karen Baburyan, who 
just returned from St. Petersburg, and asked to comment on the 
results of the meeting. 
  "I met Chairmen of Armenian and Azeri parliaments, Chairman 
of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly V. Shumeyko, Chairman of 
the Kyrgyz Supreme Council and Chairman of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Group on Karabakh M. Sherimkulov, Special 
Envoy of the Russian President V. Kazimirov in St. Petersburg. 
  The essence of the meeting was that the Bishkek agreement 
exists, and (development in) this (direction) should continue. 
The session of the Interparliamentarian assembly discussed the 
ways of resolving the Abkhazian conflict. Several announcements 
were made regarding the Karabakh conflict, but no concrete 
documents have been signed. The agreements were mainly oral. 
One of the most important, is about creation and functioning of 
CIS peace-making forces. These were the most important problems 
discussed in St. Petersburg. 
  I may add that I visited Moscow before the St. Petersburg 
meeting, and met the leaders of the Russian parliament. We 
discussed the details and ways of resolving the Karabakh 
conflict. This all has once again been confirmed in St. 
Petersburg. Active work will start in a few days, in order to 
support the efforts of the parliamentarians by actions of 
executive bodies."

  [Text] Tallinn, June 14, BNS -- Talks continue in Moscow 
today between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
and a deputy chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, Raul 
Malk, a spokesman at the Foreign Ministry in Tallinn said. 
  Churkin and Malk held their first talks in Tallinn June 7 
and 
8 without any tangible result toward resolving the tangled state 
in relations between the two countries. But both parties at the 
Tallinn talks said they will continue active contacts. 
  Churkin told reporters before leaving Tallinn that "with 
good 
will, there is nothing unrealistic" about the Aug. 31, 1994, 
troop withdrawal deadline. In his words, there has to be a firm 
basis in terms of agreements to proceed energetically with what 
is necessary to complete the withdrawal. 
  The Russian diplomat said a "realistic agreement that is up 
to the very high international standards of human rights" is 
needed to remove the tensions in Estonian-Russian relations. He 
voiced hope that such an agreement will be concluded. 
  Both Churkin and his Estonian partner in talks were 
short-spoken when commenting on actual progress in hammering out 
such agreements. 
  "(There is) nothing concrete to announce at this stage," 
Malk 
said. "Over the course of two days we have had good talks. ... 
We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as possible." 
  Churkin, too, noted that talks with Malk were at a stage 
when 
it was premature to get more specific. In his words, an 
agreement was reached that the talks would soon continue and 
that Malk may go to Moscow already next week. 
  "It seems to me that (we talked) with a sincere attempt on 
both sides to solve as quickly as possible those questions which 
still remain, in order that we can turn the page, perhaps even 
finish an entire chapter in the history of our relations," 
Churkin told reporters June 8.

  [Text] Viktor Alksnis, former USSR Supreme Soviet deputy, 
today reminded us of his existence. 
  [Correspondent Irina Zaytseva] Viktor Alksnis, born 1950, 
Latvian, former deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the former USSR, 
soldier, resigned from the Army in order to fight for the 
restoration of the USSR. During the October events he left the 
White House with a head wound and was taken to hospital. 
  After a long interval Viktor Alksnis held a news conference 
today in the Slavjanskaya Hotel. He began it with a short 
statement, the essence of which comes down to the fact that the 
adoption of the Latvian citizenship law violates not only human 
rights, but creates the conditions for a conflict similar, in 
his opinion, to the ones in Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. It was 
not only the Latvian Government Alksnis accused of this, but 
also the United States. According to him, during the latest 
visit to the United States by [Latvian President] Guntis 
Ulmanis, sanction was obtained for the adoption of the 
aforementioned discriminatory law. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] And thus carte blanche was given 
for mild ethnic cleansing of the Russian speaking population of 
the republic. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Apart from that, Alksnis added, according to 
information received from reliable sources, certain circles in 
Moscow want conflict in Latvia. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] A certain scenario exists to drive 
a so-called security corridor along the route 
Daugavpils-Yekabpils-Riga where stringent ethnic cleansing of 
the Latvian population will take place in reply to the mild 
ethnic cleansing of the Russian population in order to bring 
so-called independent Latvia to its knees. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Journalists asked for more precise information 
about what Alksnis called reliable sources. 
  [Begin Alksnis recording] You understand that I cannot name 
these sources. But I can say that they are fairly 
authoritative. [end recording] 
  [Zaytseva] Asked what he intends to do, Alksnis said his 
opportunities are unfortunately limited, and that is why he is 
appealing to journalists. In his opinion, only joint efforts 
can bring this information to the attention of world public 
opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the 
coming tragedy.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- Ukraine's Acting Prime 
Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said in a report to the Supreme 
Council session today that the government has managed for the 
first time to control the situation without emergency powers or 
emergency measures and to stop the decline in the public's net 
money income and the gross national product, as well as the 
growth of the budget deficit. 
  "The government has been in office since September last year 
when the ongoing executive power crisis was worsened by the 
energy and payment crises which resulted from the ill-considered 
price and credit policy of the previous government," he said. 
"At that time forecasts were heard both inside the government 
and in the media that Ukraine would not survive the crisis and 
would lose its sovereignty. Therefore, the new government's 
urgent steps included, first of all, prevention of the payment 
crisis. The government allocated 2,300 billion karbovantsi in 
credits and 6,300 billion karbovantsi in budget grants for the 
harvest and spring sowing. Already 1.3 million of the envisaged 
2 million [metric] tonnes of oil products have been supplied to 
the countryside. The presidential decree `On provision of 
finance and credits toward food procurement' was aimed at 
creating more favorable conditions in agriculture." 
  One of the government's achievements, according to 
Zvyahilskyy, was the overcoming of the energy crisis. The 
energy complex was on the brink of collapse, therefore, the 
government used hard currency to improve the situation and 
deliver fuel supplies on more favorable terms than last year. 
Over five million tonnes of coal was supplied to electric power 
stations. Restrictions were imposed on the consumption of all 
types of energy in the industry and at home, "which did not make 
the government any more popular." However, a number of 
legislative acts were not passed, including a law on energy 
saving. The government coordinated the price, budget, and 
credit policies. "Price control by economic means must become 
part and parcel of our economic policy," Zvyahilskyy said. "We 
were warned that all government actions aimed at controlling the 
prices would lead to accumulation of inflation potential, 
therefore we had to keep looking for ways of curbing it 
irrespective of the economic situation. I believe that 
inflation would make progress if the present government's policy 
were suddenly changed. 
  "During our discussions with the National Bank we concluded 
that it was not necessary to subordinate the National Bank of 
Ukraine to the Cabinet of Ministers. The government was forced 
to propose a deficit-free budget to the Supreme Council." 
  As regards currency regulation, Zvyahilskyy believes, the 
government proceeds from the position that prices for 
energy-carriers, which condition prices for all other goods, 
including food, fuel and lubricants, and medicines depend on the 
level of the karbovanets exchange rate. The regulated exchange 
rate of the karbovanets, together with the government's other 
antiinflationary measures, facilitated the stabilization of 
prices on the domestic market. If the real exchange rate of the 
karbovanets in relation to the dollar fell by 43 times in 
commercial banks in the whole of 1993, and by 13 times in 
relation to the Russian ruble, then in five months of this year 
it fell by 45 percent in relation to the dollar, which 
corresponds to the volume of the National Bank's credit 
emission, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets in relation 
to the Russian ruble remains stable. Yukhym Zvyahilskyy 
expressed the conviction that the regulated exchange rate of the 
karbovanets should remain and that trading at the exchange 
should not be resumed until the karbovanets strengthens. 
Otherwise, on the first day [of trading] the measures to 
restrain inflation would have been exhausted. 
  The level of the average wage is periodically reviewed in 
order to ensure the social protection of the population. Thus, 
if the average wage was 81,000 karbovantsi in August last year, 
then it was 880,000 karbovantsi in April of this year. The 
poverty level is determined and payments in connection with the 
price rises have been established with the aim of increasing the 
targeting of payments. The regulation of consumption funds has 
been reviewed. 
  Foreign economic activity is an important factor in the 
development of the Ukrainian economy. This year, Ukraine's 
exports were $2.9 million, and imports were $2.9 million. The 
negative balance of foreign payments has been reduced by several 
times. 
  Among the main problems needing urgent resolution, Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy singled out the summer harvesting, timely 
preparations for the winter, and, the most important thing, 
overcoming the decline in production.

  [Text] Today the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet adopted a law on 
local power bodies and local rule. Deputies rejected the 
amendments providing for subordination of the local authorities 
to the Ukrainian president. Observers in Kiev say that this 
limited the powers of the president at a local level. 
  In accordance with the law, the heads of the local bodies 
will be subordinated only to the cabinet of ministers and to the 
Councils of a higher authority. 
  On 26 June (after the local elections) the powers of the 
regional administrations will be transferred to the chairmen and 
executive committees of the Councils. The Councils' deputies 
will have the right to be a part of the local executive power. 
  A member of the parliamentary commission on legal policy, 
Sergey Sobolev, called on the Ukrainian president not to sign 
this law since, he said, it contradicted the Ukrainian 
Constitution. In accordance with provision 89 of the 
Constitution, deputies of the local councils cannot be members 
of the executive committees.

  [Text] Kiev -- The Supreme Council of Ukraine evening 
plenary sitting on 14 June discussed the draft Law of Ukraine 
"On Changes and Additions to the Law of Ukraine `On Forming 
Local Authorities and Self-Government Bodies'." Two drafts of 
amendments had been put forward, one by the commission for 
issues of legal policy, judicial, and legal reform, chaired by 
Volodymyr Stretovych of the "Agrarians of Ukraine" grouping; and 
the other by the commission for issues of nation building, 
council activities, and self-government, chaired by Oleksandr 
Steshenko of the Communist grouping. Differences on positions 
of principle in them made sure the debate was heated. Virtually 
all amendments, proposed by the commission for issues of nation 
building, council activities, and self-government, were passed 
by a majority vote. 
  Most disagreement emerged in discussing the following 
articles: 

  -  Article 4, stipulating that chairmen of councils at all 
levels, including towns' rayon councils and their executive 
committees, be accountable and responsible to the relevant 
councils. In matters of exercising the state executive 
authority powers delegated to them, they are subordinate to the 
Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the chairman of the 
executive committee at a council of a higher level. The 
commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform was 
insistent a provision on subordination to the Ukrainian 
president also be added to this article. 
  -  Article 3, under which 
both the relevant council's deputies and individuals who are not 
deputies can be members of an executive committee. This 
amendment is effectively in breach of Article 85 of Ukraine's 
Constitution, where it is ruled that a deputy cannot be a member 
of an executive council. The view of some of the deputies is 
that the appropriate amendment can also be put forward in the 
course of examining the draft Law "On Ukraine's Cabinet of 
Ministers" and amendments to the Law "On the President of 
Ukraine", which it is planned will be considered this week. 
Appeals by deputies from the groupings of Rukh, "Reforms," 
"Statehood," Interregional Deputies Group, and others to 
Oleksandr Tkachenko, Supreme Council of Ukraine first deputy 
chairman, who was chairing the sitting, did not encounter 
support. 
  -  Article 8, saying that after the election of deputies 
and chairmen of all levels and the formation of executive 
committees at councils, the Law of Ukraine "On a representative 
of the Ukrainian president" shall become invalid and the powers 
of oblast, Kiev and Sevastopol municipal, rayon, Kiev and 
Sevastopol municipal rayon, and local administrations shall be 
transferred to the relevant councils' chairmen and executive 
committees. 

  The commission for legal policy, judicial, and legal reform 
proposed that added to this article be a provision that, in the 
event that elections fail to be held, or were considered not to 
take place, or there are any breaches of the legislation, local 
administrations carry on exercising their powers temporarily 
until the holding of new elections. The amendment was not 
passed, which gave its authors, notably Rukh's Oleksandr 
Lavrynovych, reasons to state that Ukraine was thus deprived of 
its state representative in Crimea as, indeed, it was possible 
that elections there would fail to take place. 
  In token of protest against these decisions being passed, 
some deputies of national democratic orientation left the 
session's chamber and did not vote on the changes to the law as 
a whole. Serhiy Sobolyev of the "Reforms" grouping has 
officially requested the Ukrainian president not to sign this 
law as it was passed knowingly in breach of Ukraine's current 
Constitution.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature, compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] A candidate for this month's presidential elections, 
the present head of state, Leonid Kravchuk, has said: if he 
gets elected he will press for adopting a new constitution. He 
also stands for sharing power between the president and 
parliament, which, in his view, excludes the possibility of 
monopolizing authority by one of the branches of power. 
  This is stated in Kravchuk's election program, which became 
available to INTERFAX. The program is called "To strengthen the 
state and speed up reforms through civic concord." 
  Kravchuk views himself as a supporter of unitarian state 
with 
well-developed self-government and broad economic independence 
for the regions. He stands for settling relations with the 
Republic of the Crimea legislatively. 
  Kravchuk calls for developing the CIS, for promoting 
economic 
integration in its framework, for having equitable relations 
with the neighbors, including Russia. 
  He finds it necessary to radically improve the climate for 
investment and enable the domestic and foreign entrepreneurs to 
be equally interested in making investments in Ukraine's 
industries. 
  Kravchuk is planning to speed up the implementation of a 
full-scale monetary reform and the introduction of the grivna. 
  He thinks it necessary to lower interest rates, separate the 
funds belonging to enterprises from national revenues and step 
up privatization under government control. 
  Kravchuk also finds it possible to have two official 
languages in the country -- Ukrainian and Russian. According to 
observers, Kravchuk's stand in favor of giving Russian the 
status of another official language is designed to ensure for 
him additional votes in elections in Ukraine's east and 
south-east, where the Russian speaking population is predominant. 
  Addressing students at the university in Zaporozhye on 
Monday, another presidential candidate, Leonid Kuchma, strongly 
criticized the present head of state. The people are capable of 
comparing their 1990 and 1994 living standards. If they want to 
continue destroying their economy for another four years, let 
them reelect Kravchuk, he said. 
  He stands only for an economic union with Russia, Kuchma 
pointed out. He never called for forming a Slav union. In this 
connection he dismissed the relevant statement by Kravchuk and 
added that it must be embarrassing for a president to tell open 
lies and attribute such ideas to him. 
  With reference to the Black Sea Fleet problem Kuchma 
stressed 
that today "we would not have spoken about the fact that Ukraine 
was defeated politically and economically in that area, had the 
Ukrainian leadership heeded his call for leasing the fleet to 
Russia a year ago." 
  IF Note: As regards the popularity of presidential 
candidates, Leonid Kuchma is in the lead. Witness the poll 
conducted by Socis- Gallap among 1200 voters in all areas of 
Ukraine. The poll shows that 19 pct of respondents give 
preference to Kuchma, 18 pct to Kravchuk, 6 pct to Ivan Plusch 
and 5 pct to Vladimir Lanovoy. The other contenders are trusted 
by less than 1 pct of those questioned.

  [Text] The elections of the president and local power 
bodies scheduled for 26 June in Ukraine can lead to a 
confrontation between the head of the state and the parliament, 
believes Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Speaking at a press conference on his return from 
Luxembourg, 
Kravchuk declared that a referendum would actually take place in 
Ukraine on 26 June. 
  "If the people come to elect the president they will 
actually 
give their backing to the presidential-parliamentary form of the 
state system," he believes. 
  Kravchuk underlined that in the course of the 26 June 
elections the president would be elected in accordance with the 
acting Constitution--both as the head of the state and the head 
of the executive power. 
  In this case, he emphasized, in the future the legislature 
should be brought in line with this provision. "If the Supreme 
Soviet refuses to do this then a confrontation will be 
inevitable," declared Kravchuk, who running for the presidency 
for the second term. 
  On Tuesday [14 June], Ukraine's Supreme Soviet declined 
amendments to the decree on the formation of local 
self-management bodies which stipulates that heads of local 
councils should be subordinated to the president. The present 
law preserves their subordination to the government and to the 
council standing above them. 
  According to observers, this will lead to a sharp 
restriction 
of the president's influence in domestic policy. 
  "Somebody wants to make these elections into a farce," said 
Kravchuk. He said that "at first the deputies voted for 
nationwide elections of the president" and then started to 
restrict his authorities. 
  Kravchuk was also critical of the position of communists in 
the parliament who speak about the need to abolish the 
presidency in the Republic. He called their actions "a 
strategy" which is intended "to bar movement forward."

  [Text] Lvov -- The political council of the New Wave 
Association has made its decision on support of candidates in 
the presidential election, Yuriy Shveda, chairman of the 
association's secretariat, told UNIAN on 14 June. "Only recently 
New Wave was inclined to support Ivan Plyushch," he said. "But 
today there are two presidential candidates who really stand a 
chance to be elected, Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk. 
Considering this setup, and also the fact that Kuchma 
represents pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, New Wave has decided 
to support and campaign for the current president of Ukraine, 
Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "Although we have certain reservations about him, and we are 
particularly dissatisfied with his indecisive attitude to 
economic reforms and his personnel policy, New Wave sees no 
alternative to Kravchuk," Shveda told UNIAN.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- In an exclusive 
telephone interview with a UNIAN correspondent yesterday, 
Vitaliy Masol stated that he is not sure whether his candidacy 
for the post of prime minister will be submitted for examination 
by Ukraine's Supreme Council on 15 June. Speaking about the 
probability of a group of deputies blocking this election 
because they fundamentally disagree with electing a government 
before the presidential election, Vitaliy Masol noted: "We are 
always searching for something -- to begin with, how to block 
the election of people's deputies, then [how to block] the 
elections to local bodies of power and the presidential 
election. If the reason for the protests is my candidacy, then 
I, unlike many people, am not striving for power, because I know 
what it is and what state the economy is in now." 
  Vitaliy Masol is convinced that the government should be 
elected without delay, because it is possible that a president 
will not be elected on 26 June, and the situation could be 
repeated in the second round as well. He agreed with the 
reasons of some politicians who believe that the election of a 
prime minister now is a risky affair, because a candidate could 
be proposed by Leonid Kravchuk, but Kuchma could come to power. 
But he is convinced that it is not permissible to delay the 
formation of the government for another two months. 
  In Vitaliy Masol's opinion, the prime minister should head 
the government, and not the president. "If we truly want to 
have an independent legal democratic Ukraine, then we should not 
do what we did in the last two years: We lost power and the 
governance of the state, and no one knows who is responsible for 
what." Vitaliy Masol declined to assess the actions of the 
government, led by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, observing that "the 
newspapers publish everything anyway." 
  Vitaliy Masol maintained that he will not be taking part in 
the 14 June discussion of the report by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy on 
the government's activity for moral and ethical reasons, because 
he does not want to repeat the mistaken practice of those who, 
while approaching power, criticized their predecessors. With 
regard to an action program, he observed that it is the affair 
of the government as a whole, and it will have to be elaborated 
together, and not with one person governing, "as happens now." 
  "In the event that I am elected, I will rely above all on 
balance and predictions, as is the practice throughout the 
world. The government must know how much breadgrain it has and 
whether it will be able to feed its people. Those who are 
against a planned economy have evidently never worked in such a 
system. I have devoted many years to this and know that there 
really is much in it which is not required, and if I were asked 
to head the state planning now, I would not agree to do it," 
Vitaliy Masol said. 
  In answer to a question about whether he would include in 
his 
team any of those whose candidacies for this post have recently 
been discussed, Vitaliy Masol replied that it is possible, and 
maybe even more than one of them, but he maintained that above 
all this would proceed from the point of view of their 
professionalism, experience, and understanding of the situation. 
He also expressed the conviction that young people should enter 
the government.

<F P=106> [Statement by Ivan Plyushch, Ukraine's people's deputy and </F>
presidential candidate: "My Program as Ukrainian President"] 
  [Text] After an objective assessment of the situation that 
has taken shape in our state's political, economic, and social 
spheres, I am deeply convinced that Ukraine has every 
possibility to stabilize the situation in the near future and 
gradually raise the standard of living to a level worthy of man. 
  My experience that I gained in life, work, and politics and 
my professional knowledge enable me to determine those 
priorities which are essential for overcoming the difficulties 
and crisis phenomena that have befallen us during this difficult 
transitional period and, finally, change the situation for the 
better and inspire people with hope and confidence in the future. 
  The first and main priority from which I will proceed 
concerns the needs and interests of the independent state and of 
the people, as well as interests of the individual. 
<H8>  Strategic and Tactical Trends in My Program </H8>
<H5>  In the Economic Sphere </H5>
  1. Economic Reforms -- only for the benefit of the people 
and 
not at the people's expense. I will not be guided by utopian 
programs, but by absolutely specific matters: 
  -- Reform in the banking, finance, and taxation systems; 
  -- The creation of reliable guarantees for a free 
development 
of civilized entrepreneurship; 
  -- Struggle against price-fixing extortion and inflation; 
  -- Balancing of prices and incomes. 
  2. An improvement of the course of economic reforms in such 
a 
way as to make it possible to put an end to the vulgar 
enrichment of some individuals at the expense of the 
impoverishment of the majority of people. 
  3. Ukraine's economic revival -- The building of a strong, 
efficient, and socially-oriented economy by way of its 
restructuring and implementation of up-to-date technologies. 
  4. Fair privatization by the people and the creation of 
reasonably equal starting conditions for every person 
participating in the privatization and the provision of equality 
of all forms of ownership and economic activity, so that every 
person would feel himself as a master of the means of production 
and of the results of his labor. 
  5. Comprehensive development of the agro-industrial complex, 
state support for both collective and individual farms, 
repayment of debts to peasants, and the establishment of a 
stable parity of prices of agricultural and industrial products. 
<H5>  In the Social Sphere </H5>
  1. Promotion of the spiritual revival of the Ukrainian 
people, the development of culture and language, the 
strengthening of the material and technological base of national 
education, of communal services, physical culture and sports; 
recognition of the role of religion in the rebirth of society; 
the maintenance of conditions for the development of fundamental 
science. 
  2. Consistent adherence in Ukraine to the principles of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as of other legal 
acts that guarantee free and comprehensive development of the 
individual and his reliable social protection. 
  3. Gradual improvement of peoples' standard of living based 
on an increase in the remuneration for labor worthy of the 
working people and a reduction of prices of goods. The latter 
may be achieved with the help of reducing taxes, price additions 
for intermediate trade, and production expenses. 
  4. Avoidance of mass unemployment, creation of the system of 
guaranteed protection for the low-income strata of the 
population -- war and labor veterans, pensioners, families with 
many children, handicapped people, single elderly people, 
students, and also those who have remained without a 
breadwinner; establishment of pensions and scholarships that 
would not be lower than the living wage. 
  5. True compensation for the population's savings, lost as a 
result of inflation, at the level of the purchasing power which 
prevailed in 1990. 
  6. An increase in the production of goods for children and a 
better care about women, young families, and young people. 
  7. Creation of healthy conditions of life, provision of a 
clean environment, the development of forestry, national parks, 
and ecological preserves. 
  8. Ecologically-oriented approach to the planning and 
building of towns, villages, and settlements; curtailment of the 
building of new and reconstruction of existing atomic plants and 
hazardous industries, introduction of ecologically friendly and 
waste-free technologies; particular attention to the improvement 
of the ecological situation in those areas that have been 
affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe. 
<H5>  In the Sphere of State Building </H5>
  1. Building of a humane and democratic civil society, 
achievement of well-being and spiritual freedom for the people; 
establishment of Ukraine's true state-political and economic 
sovereignty. 
  2. Adoption of a new Ukrainian Constitution with a distinct 
statement of the principle of the division of powers and the 
most suitable mechanisms for interaction among legislative, 
executive, and judicial power for building a law-governed state 
having the following main characteristics: 
  -- Recognition of the Ukrainian people as the only source of 
power and of the individual, his life, rights, and freedoms -- 
as the greatest values; 
  -- Cultural, linguistic, and religious uniqueness of the 
people of all nationalities residing in Ukraine. 
  3. Elaboration, taking into account the national 
characteristics and experience of advanced democratic countries, 
of such a legislation as would promote the formation of a 
territorial structure capable of harmoniously combining general 
state, regional, and local interests. 
  4. Improvement of the representative power bodies in the 
form 
of councils as organs of people's power and their reform based 
on the principles of local government and creation of a 
necessary legal and financial and economic foundation for their 
activity. 
  5. Maintenance of civic peace and harmony in Ukraine, 
strengthening of law and order, intensification of the struggle 
against organized crime and corruption, and a reliable 
protection of human honor, dignity, life, and health. 
  6. Building of Ukraine's Armed Forces and constant concern 
about the well-being of servicemen and their families. 
<H5>  In External Policy </H5>
  1. Extensive economic integration of Ukraine's national 
economic complex, first and foremost with CIS countries and also 
with other states, gradual merging into the European and world 
economic community, and the creation of a corresponding legal 
base and practical conditions for that. 
  2. Strengthening of Ukraine's international prestige as a 
great peace-loving and civilized European power, preservation of 
its territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. 
  3. Preservation of peace, prevention of armed conflicts, no 
matter where they might flare up, and establishment of Ukraine's 
status as a peace-loving, nonaligned, and nonnuclear power. 
  I will do everything in order that our young independent 
state could occupy a worthy position among advanced European and 
world countries as soon as possible.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Candidate for the 
post of Ukraine's prime minister, people's deputy Vitaliy Masol, 
said in an exclusive interview for UNIAN during a break in the 
session that he was doubtful as to his own need to accept the 
possible appointment. "It would not add to the image, and in a 
while there will be a lot of ruckus and I will be blamed for all 
sins." Masol believes economic management over the past two 
years has led to a great many irreparable losses. He stressed 
that his only motive was "being unable to remain on the 
sidelines after the Kuchma government has made, alas, so many 
ill-considered moves." Masol said he had seen the report by 
Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz, who will present his 
proposals on overcoming Ukraine's economic crisis at the 
parliament session on 15 June. He denied having drawn up 
Moroz's "main guidelines" himself, but said that a lot of it had 
been borrowed by the speaker from Masol's own book.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy by </F>
Aleksandr Kabanov; place and date not given: "Volodymyr 
Lanovyy: `When There Is No Responsibility, There Is No Democracy 
Either...'"; from the "Current Interview" feature] 
  [Text] [Kabanov] How do you envision the mechanism for 
people's deputies' responsibility before their voters? 
  [Lanovyy] No such strict mechanism exists in Ukraine, and 
this means, no matter how sad it seems to be, that there is no 
democracy. In the United States, for example, there are 18 
levels of state officials' responsibility for various crimes and 
misdemeanors. Have you ever seen a report by our finance 
minister on his work performed over the last six months? Under 
current political and economic circumstances, he simply must 
regularly explain how much of the state money is spent and for 
what. He must provide reports every month, and he must bear the 
responsibility for money resources working for nationwide 
interests, not for the interests of certain social groups. 
  [Kabanov] How do you assess your chances for victory in the 
upcoming elections? 
  [Lanovyy] I would like to appeal to the people: Look who 
has been leading you, and what these activists have achieved? 
Do you trust current President Leonid Kravchuk, former Supreme 
Council Chairman Ivan Plyushch, or former Prime Minister Leonid 
Kuchma? They had, in my opinion, every opportunity to introduce 
positive reforms. 
  I worked with them pursuing one goal -- to reform the 
Ukrainian economy as quickly as possible -- but apparently, I 
worked too fast -- I stepped on the throat of their personal 
desires and aspirations. As you recall, I was removed... 
  [Kabanov] In your opinion, are any of the other candidates 
for the presidential chair in a better situation than Parliament 
Speaker Oleksandr Moroz regarding propagandizing populist ideas? 
  [Lanovyy] As a matter of fact, having become speaker, 
Oleksandr Moroz is in the most convenient situation, even 
compared with the current president. He now has the rostrum, 
the microphone, and television -- all means to influence a 
sufficient number of voters. 
  [Kabanov] What is your opinion on the Crimean issue? 
  [Lanovyy] In terms of strategy, the Crimea must remain 
within Ukraine. They want to separate? They want to obtain the 
status of an independent state? This will not take place. Let 
them take advantage of any liberties, but the Crimean parliament 
must work in accordance with the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
resolutions. I am for a peaceful resolution to this issue, by 
means of agreement. 
  [Kabanov] How do you assess the activities of the Ukrainian 
National Assembly-Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNA-UNSO]? 
  [Lanovyy] When I was reading UNA-UNSO documents, the 
position presented in them seemed very attractive to me. 
Although I accept the actions of UNSO units in Georgia, similar 
actions should be planned at the state level without 
amateurishness. I respect both left- and right-wing forces for 
their confidence and willingness to act. Yet, it would be 
better if these forces agreed on one point -- on the need to 
work for the future and real reforms in our state. UNA-UNSO, as 
well as other public and political organizations, has the right 
to exist within the framework of the law. However, I do not 
support the methods, with the help of which the aforementioned 
organizations have been looking for self-affirmation. 
  [Kabanov] Who should have the initiative in all 
transformations within society, the president or the parliament? 
  [Lanovyy] The presidential authority has great powers in 
Ukraine. The president can make legislative decisions, he can 
even change the system of local administration. The parliament 
is waiting for the president's initiation, his program for 
socioeconomic reforms, outline of strategy for joint actions, 
and consolidation of all forces and means to resolve nationwide 
problems. The current president does not have any initiative. 
Here is a recent example: Kravchuk has recently stated that we 
do not have a law on presidency, and it therefore makes no sense 
to hold presidential elections. But why do we not have such a 
law? Who, if not Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] himself, should 
display initiative in the adoption of such a law? 
  [Kabanov] How do you assess the current economic situation? 
  [Lanovyy] Seventy percent of Ukrainian enterprises are 
currently standing idle. The government claims that there is 
stabilization. The rights to payments and credits have been 
restricted. This is why there is no money for trade. Nobody 
buys anything. Real stabilization of prices is maintained by 
balancing supply and demand through either an increase in the 
volume of production (either domestic production, or imports), 
or structural redistribution (surplus production in one sector 
is compensated by selling the overstock abroad and importing 
scarce products). In Ukraine, apparent stabilization has been 
achieved by the artificial damming of trade. 
  Someone once told me a very apropriate analogy: I want to 
pull you out of water because you are drowning. I throw a noose 
over your neck and pull. I will eventually pull you out of the 
water, but will this do you any good? Prices in Ukraine have 
been bridled in such a way that everybody will eventually die. 
Thus, all the talk about stabilization in groundless. As a 
matter of fact, another collapse and disorder is coming.

94] 
  [Text] Despite its 67 percent completion, construction of 
the Varyag (Varangian) aircraft carrier was frozen since Russia, 
the former Soviet Navy's successor, refused to finance it. 
  The Nikolaev Navy yard, which started the ship's 
construction, is said to have suffered colossal losses involving 
the ship's maintenance (see UBN no. 1/1993). 
  The Ukrainian Government remains undecided on the 
construction completion issue. 
  The Varyag, which was designed to carry as many as 80 combat 
aircraft and thus could be employed for naval task force 
missions, is said to be too costly (about $1 billion) to make 
prospects of its marketing abroad bright. 
  The Ministry of Engineering, MIC [military-industrial 
complex] and conversion is reported as studying the Varyag's 
utilization. 
  However, the almost completed Ulyanov aircraft carrier, 
which 
was scrapped for metal, failed to find buyers. The Chernomorski 
Navy yard, which was given the right to sell the scrapped ship, 
is reported as engaged in negotiations with a West German firm 
to this effect. 
  The ill-fated Varyag's replica, the Russian Navy's only 
aircraft carrier, the Admiral of Fleet Kuznetsov, which belongs 
to Russia's Northern Fleet, was built by the Chernomorski Navy 
yard, too. 
  This class ships' precursors included the Moskva, Leningard 
air-capable cruisers and the Kiev aircraft carrier.

  [Text] Odessa [no dateline as received] -- Warships that 
have been mothballed here for two years will soon undergo repair 
at a specialized Ukrainian Navy shipyard, which is being set up 
in cooperation with Odessa enterprise No. 108 and other 
specialized enterprises, Ukraine's navy commander Vice-Admiral 
Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy told UNIAN on 14 June. He added that the 
Ukrainian Navy command had cancelled a contract with the 
commercial company FTF [as received] for the repair and 
replacement of equipment at the large assault-landing vessel 
"Ilya Azarov" and other ships. 
  "We are planning to use the renovated ships to improve the 
combat readiness of fleet units rather than for holiday cruises 
in the Mediterranean," Bezkorovaynyy said.

<F P=106> [INTELEKT report: "Invaders in Their Own Country?"] </F>
  [Text] An anti-Ukrainian coalition -- Odessa's 
"Dostoyinstvo" [dignity] association -- stormily and operatively 
reacts to developments in Ukraine. It specializes in publishing 
and disseminating leaflets. The first appeared immediately 
after the well-known conflict between Ukrainian and Russian Navy 
men near Odessa. In this leaflet, Ukrainian servicemen are 
termed invaders. Another one came soon after the televised 
speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy regarding the 
situation in the Crimea. Apparently, the general wants to "throw 
us into the meat grinder of civil war." Therefore, the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council and the president should immediately 
remove him from the post of defense minister. The key 
expression in the leaflet is even more radical: "Dostoyinstvo" 
calls on Odessa residents to defy the next draft of young people 
into the Ukrainian Army, which is, obviously, an open violation 
of Ukrainian legislation. 
  The association is headed by Oleksandr Shteyman, recent 
candidate for Ukrainian people's deputy, whose real name became 
known to Odessa residents during the electoral campaign. Before 
that, he had been Kamenskiy for some reason. 
  The leaflet does not suggest under which army banners the 
Odessa youth should fight. Nor does it explain why the 
Ukrainian Army is considered invasive on Ukrainian territory.

Vladimir Konoplitsky] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk June 15 TASS -- President Boris 
Yeltsin is expected to sign a decree soon on a new phase of 
privatisation, Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
told journalists on Wednesday. 
  Yeltsin is to apply to the Federal Assembly and initiate a 
bill on a new phase of cheque privatisation which will meet both 
the interests of the country and those of regions and large 
cities. 
  This step by the president, in the opinion of the press 
secretary, develops and furthers the privatisation ideology 
worked out by the State Property Committee, and clearly 
differentates between federal, municipal and private property. 
Thus, the very dispute about privatisation methods at various 
levels will be politically settled. 
  Tackling this problem, the president proceeds from the 
assumption that under privatisation conditions, it is federal 
property interests first of all that must be upheld. No 
personnel reshuffles at the State Property Committee are 
expected. So, Anatoliy Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov 
will have nothing to argue about any longer, Kostikov said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Takes Emergency Measures </F>
in Fight against Crime Orgy"] 
  [Text] On 14 June, President B. Yeltsin signed the edict 
"On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population from Banditry and 
other Manifestations of Organized Crime." 
  Bearing in mind the acuteness of this problem, we are 
publishing the document in its entirety. 
  [Edict begins] For the purposes of protecting the lives and 
property interests of citizens, ensuring the security of society 
and the state, and to implement the Russian Federation Federal 
Program for Stepping Up the Fight Against Crime for 1994-1995 
prior to the adoption by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly 
of legislative acts in the sphere of combating crime, I decree: 
  1. That a system of urgent measures shall be enacted to 
combat banditry and other serious crimes committed by organized 
criminal groups; 
  --where there is sufficient evidence of an individual's 
involvement in a gang or other organized criminal group 
suspected of committing serious crimes and by agreement with the 
prosecutor's office prior to the institution of criminal 
proceedings, expert appraisals may be conducted, the results of 
which may be viewed as evidence in criminal cases of the given 
category and preliminary investigations may be authorized into 
the financial and economic activity and property and financial 
status not only of the individual in question but also his 
relatives or other persons residing with him in the previous 
five years and also in respect of physical and legal persons or 
public associations whose property, resources, or name may have 
been exploited or used by the suspect; 
  --for the preparation and implementation of investigations 
and the prevention and detection of crimes, active use may be 
made of information resulting from operational investigations, 
which may be regarded in the prescribed manner as evidence in 
criminal cases of this category; 
  --as preventive measures against those suspected or accused 
of the aforementioned crimes, the following shall not be valid: 
recognizance not to leave, personal guaranty of a defendant's 
appearance, guaranty provided by social organizations, or a 
bond, and the suspect may be detained for a period of up to 30 
days; 
  --bank and commercial confidentiality shall be no bar to the 
obtaining in the prescribed manner by the organs of the 
prosecutor's office, internal affairs, counterintelligence, or 
the tax police of information or documents relating to financial 
and economic activity, deposits, and dealings relating to the 
accounts of physical or legal persons involved in the commission 
of bandit attacks or other serious crimes carried out by 
organized criminal groups; 
  --the authorized representatives of the internal affairs and 
counterintelligence organs shall have the right to inspect the 
buildings and premises of enterprises, institutions, and 
organizations irrespective of forms of ownership, acquaint 
themselves with documentation characterizing their activity, and 
also examine transport facilities and their drivers and 
passengers. 
  2. The leaders of the executive of the components of the 
Federation shall; 
  --draw up a list of cities and individual localities which 
are to be kept under special surveillance in connection with the 
prevalence on those territories of cases of banditry and other 
manifestations of organized crime; 
  --instruct the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the 
Internal Affairs administrations, the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, [FCS], and FCS administrations to 
transfer the personnel of the internal affairs organs and the 
counterintelligence organs of those cities and individual 
localities to an intensified form of official operational 
activity for the performance of special operations in the fight 
against banditry and other manifestations of organized crime; 
  --ensure the targeted use of financial resources as material 
incentives for staffers of the internal affairs and 
counterintelligence organs and servicemen of the internal troops 
participating in special operations to combat banditry and other 
manifestations of organized crime and also those working in the 
intensified form of operations in cities and individual 
localities; 
  --elaborate and implement through the legislative organs of 
the components of the Federation additional measures of a legal 
character for the intensification of the struggle against 
banditry and other manifestations of organized crime. 
  3. The Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Russian 
Federation FCS shall, within 10 days, elaborate and send to the 
leaders of subordinate organs a joint instruction on the 
procedure for the practical implementation of the norms of the 
present Edict.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "President B. Yeltsin Makes </F>
an Inspection Tour of the Country"] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk -- On 14 June President B. Yeltsin 
once again set out on a tour of the country. This time he has 
come to the city of Blagoveshchensk, situated at the confluence 
of the Zeya and Amur Rivers, where Russian soil ends. 
  Economic matters constitute the chief reason why Yeltsin has 
made the many-hour flight from Moscow. More accurately, he 
intends to familiarize himself on the spot with the painful 
problems which get on the nerves of the population of Amur Kray, 
while adopted government decisions are still not being 
implemented. In other words, Yeltsin, freed from the grueling 
confrontation with the representative power in the form of the 
soviets, is returning once again to the practice of inspection 
tours and live contact with people. 
  The priority issues which the local leaders intend to 
discuss 
with the president include border trade, the creation of a free 
economic zone, and the kray's electricity supply. Each of these 
has had noticeable repercussions on a Russia-wide scale. 
Therefore, before the president left Moscow, Blagoveshchensk was 
visited by Vice Premier A. Shokhin; Yu. Shafranik, leader of the 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy; and representatives of the Ministry 
of Finance and other departments. To all appearances, the 
president does not intend to get away with promises to 
investigate everything but to adopt some decisions on the spot. 
  According to A. Korabelshchikov, his aide, Yeltsin is 
interested in the reaction of the regions' leaders to his recent 
economic edicts, particularly as another block of documents is 
being prepared in this field. He intends to speak about the 
progress of the economic reform at the final conference in 
Blagoveshchensk. In addition, Amur Oblast is one of the few 
producers of soybeans in the country. The oblast's people 
produce this crop with difficulty, but things are extremely bad 
with regard to reorganizing the matter. Therefore, local 
agrarian specialists have invited the president to a collective 
farm, that is to say, to the "Partizan" Limited Partnership. 
  After familiarizing himself with the problems of Amur 
Oblast, 
it is in Yeltsin's plans to fly to the Tuva Republic. Although 
this invitation is linked with a jubilee, the 50th anniversary 
of the former Tuva's joining Russia, the president will not 
merely attend a demonstration concert by local dancers who wish 
to show their art on a mountain pasture to the accompaniment of 
the guttural sounds of national instruments. Problems of 
developing national culture and museum work and the position of 
the intelligentsia will be discussed with the republic's 
leadership. 
  In parallel, just as in Amur Oblast, the president plans to 
investigate why a whole number of programs approved in Moscow 
with assurances of financial support -- particularly those aimed 
at developing the road network in the republic, creating an air 
bridge between Kyzyl and Moscow, and also constructing a plant 
for the processing of hides -- have come to a standstill or have 
not been started up at all. It was explained to IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent in the presidential apparatus, however, that the 
president will not take an aircraft full of money to Kyzyl, as 
was formerly the case at Barnaul. There will be a discussion of 
executive discipline -- which seems sensible.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Dineyev report: "Moscow Government Sitting. </F>
Moscow Authorities Ready To Override Laws"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's session of the city administration 
discussed a draft decree on progress made to carry out Mayor 
Yuriy Luzhkov's directive "On the Imposition of Special Rules of 
Sojourn in the City of Moscow, the Russian Federation Capital, 
for Citizens Permanently Resident Outside Russia." Speakers at 
the session put forward such radical ideas on tightening the 
rules in Moscow that they themselves came to doubt their 
legality. However, Luzhkov thought, Moscow will live in 
accordance with its own ideas of human rights even if they 
contravene the laws in force. 
  The Moscow administration has been more active of late in 
pressing for the recognition of Moscow as a city with a special 
status. Yesterday, for example, it was proposed during the 
session to further tighten the registration rules in force in 
Moscow by increasing liability and the size of fine for 
violating them. The majority of participants in the session 
felt that citizens trying to evade registration should be 
subject to "extremely large" fines, a detention for up to 30 
days, and subsequent expulsion from Moscow. 
  Yesterday's discussion, however, was not limited to the 
questions of registration of visitors in Moscow. Mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov announced a new presidential edict on combating banditry 
and organized crime which considerably widens the powers of law 
and order organs. The mayor thought the document gives the 
go-ahead for resolute actions by the Moscow administration. In 
this connection, Luzhkov proposed a series of steps aimed at 
freeing the city from "visiting thieves" and stabilizing the 
crime situation in the city. In particular he declared it 
necessary to demand that the Foreign Ministry tighten the visa 
rules for citizens arriving in Moscow from countries "with a 
complex situation," having in mind the developing countries of 
Africa and Asia. The Moscow government premier thinks that in 
imposing tough measures one should not be hidebound by 
legislation because "it is especially important to throw out of 
Moscow those who should not be here." 
  Sergey Dontsov, head of the City Hall legal administration, 
tried to argue against the view of his own boss. Dontsov thinks 
sending people outside the limits of Moscow and Russia is not 
only a violation of the right to freedom of movement, it is 
simply an ineffective measure because "those thrown out go back 
to the city without ever reaching their destination." "We 
override laws by bringing in new rules while you render the 
registration rule impotent," the mayor retorted.

"Kyrgyzstan is Our Common Home," which is in progress in 
Bishkek, are discussing the diversity of problems connected with 
the life of the Russian -- or even broader -- the Slavic 
diaspora in Kyrgyzstan. The forum was convened at the 
initiative and under the patronage of President Akayev. 
  It is not by chance that Akayev is taking an active part in 
all the events of the forum. Last Saturday [11 June] was a 
really Russian day in Akayev's life. Apart from his speech at 
the opening ceremony and his interested participation in a 
roundtable discussion on Russians in Kyrgyzstan, Akayev also 
spoke at the opera and ballet house during a solemn evening 
devoted to the 195th anniversary of Pushkin. 
  On the eve of the forum, in a conversation with Mikhail 
Romanov, ambassador of Russia to Kyrgyzstan, Akayev noted that 
it would have been much better not to exchange reprimands 
addressed to each other but to get together and to discuss in 
full detail the problems connected with the life of the Russian 
and other Slavic peoples in Kyrgyzstan. 
  The president has done his part to hold a discussion that is 
highly useful. First, a large group of the forum's participants 
was brought from Moscow to Bishkek at his personal invitation 
and on his personal plane--a group that included renowned 
political scientists, historians, lawyers, sociologists, former 
state figures who worked in Kyrgyzstan, and Russian and foreign 
journalists. [passage omitted] 
  Second, and important, the president provided the right 
direction for the discussion in his speech at the opening of the 
forum. This speech, in the opinion of the forum's many 
participants, was very deep, frank, and intellectually rich, as 
well as thought-provoking, analytical, and scientific, and it 
was based on facts and arguments rather than on emotions. 
  Discussing the Republic's economic prospects, Akayev said he 
had to be honest with his people and to admit that Kyrgyzstan 
would remain at the outskirts of the world economy for a long 
time--at least for the next 10 years. The Republic is not able 
to maintain its production structure and its infrastructure at 
the moment and has been forced to eliminate a number of specific 
areas of more or less outdated production and stop them. 
  Akayev said that Kyrgyzstan does not have any other way out. 
The population's living standard is very low. Possibilities to 
save on wage payments and on turnover capital attract foreign 
investors to us. Nevertheless, the profit of such investments 
is reduced to zero because of very low skill and labor 
productivity levels. In a nutshell, it is difficult to expect 
that the rating of our Republic will sharply increase with 
regard to foreign investments in the next 10-15 years. I cannot 
avoid speaking about such issues as the impoverishment of our 
liberal arts intelligentsia and the reduction of the number of 
students, coupled with the decreased quality of training, Akayev 
said. 
  The "Kyrgyzstan is Our Common Home" forum will end on 17 
June.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Geydar Aliyev by Pavel Alekseyev, </F>
datelined Baku and Moscow; date, place of interview not given: 
"Geydar Aliyev: We Only Want One Thing -- for the Truth To Be 
Known"] 
  [Text] [Alekseyev] It will soon be a year since you 
became president of Azerbaijan. Yet not many years ago most 
people were sure that G. Aliyev's political career was over.... 
  [Aliyev] You could say I did not come here at my own 
volition. After leaving the Politburo in 1987 because of 
serious disagreements with the USSR leadership, including 
Gorbachev personally, I did not engage in political activity. 
When, in late 1990, I was not allowed to live in Baku and found 
refuge in Nakhichevan, again I did not want to get involved in 
political life. But in 1991 a very difficult situation arose. 
That autonomous republic within Azerbaijan is detached from the 
state's main territory and borders on Iran, Turkey, and Armenia, 
and therefore, as a result of the war, it found itself 
blockaded. For some days the people held rallies in the 
squares, demanding that I become head of the republic's Supreme 
Council, and I was obliged to do so. I started work. It is a 
very complex region, our life was not without its difficulties, 
but it is at least peaceful, unless you count minor border 
clashes. 
  There is no war there now either, and there is not the same 
crime situation as before. Turkey has granted Nakhichevan $100 
million of credit. We immediately released $20 million of that 
to buy food, and that also alleviated the situation. And I 
thought that this autonomous republic would be my last abode. 
  But in June last year the power struggle in Azerbaijan was 
stepped up and the republic found itself on the brink of civil 
war. Then the Azerbaijani leadership, in the person of 
President Abulfaz Elchibey, appealed to me to come and help lead 
the republic out of the crisis. I did not want to return, but 
then I decided that it is wrong to stay on the sidelines if your 
people are in trouble. Unfortunately, two days after I entered 
on duty as chairman of the Azerbaijan National Assembly, 
President Elchibey left Baku in secret and has been in a 
Nakhichevan mountain village ever since. I was left alone. And 
for 11 months now I have been trying to sort out the situation 
in the republic. 
  [Alekseyev] What are the basic problems facing Azerbaijan at 
present? 
  [Aliyev] We are going through a very difficult period. The 
transition from a situation in which we were all part of a 
single Soviet state to the formation of independence and the 
consolidation of sovereignty is very difficult in itself. The 
situation is exacerbated by the fact that all the former USSR 
republics were very closely interlinked, especially in the 
economy, and the severance of ties had a very severe effect on 
Azerbaijan's economy. Then again, the republic is making the 
transition from one economic system to another, from the 
socialist economic system, with its laws and principles, to a 
free market economy. Finally, the third factor complicating the 
socioeconomic situation in Azerbaijan is the war. It has now 
been going on for six years, some 20 percent of the republic's 
territory is occupied, and there are more than 1 million 
refugees. 
  [Alekseyev] What can you say about the causes of the 
conflict, and what must be done to stop it? 
  [Aliyev] It was not the Azerbaijani side that started this 
war. There is no point now in analyzing what happened, but I 
will say one thing. When it all began, Azerbaijan was part of a 
single centralized state -- the USSR, and therefore the Union 
leadership could have prevented the outbreak of conflict. Or 
else, if conflict had begun, prevented it from developing. 
Unfortunately, this did not happen. The Karabakh conflict was 
the first on the USSR's territory, and look how many hot spots 
have developed now. 
  Azerbaijan is now waging a war to preserve its territorial 
integrity. But all this time I have been trying to put an end 
to the war through talks. There has been a cease-fire since 10 
May. Talks are now under way with the participation of the CSCE 
Minsk Group and Russia. Maybe it will be possible at last to 
reach an accord to eliminate the conflict. But on one 
condition: that the Armenian armed formations free all the 
occupied Azerbaijani territory, except, of course, 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Then we can conduct talks on the status of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  [Alekseyev] During the Bishkek talks there was talk of 
disengagement forces.... 
  [Aliyev] Look. Whatever happens, in order to stop the war, 
monitor compliance with the cease-fire accord, and ensure the 
withdrawal of Armenian armed formations, forces of some kind are 
certainly needed. The CSCE Minsk Group sees these forces as 
observers. Russia considers it possible to send in so-called 
CIS peacekeeping disengagement forces, but this question is 
still at the stage of talks. 
  [Alekseyev] How would you assess the situation in the 
Caucasus? There has been much talk recently of how Russia still 
has no clear political concept with regard to that region. 
  [Aliyev] It is hard for me to say whether Russia has a clear 
stance or not. But it is a fact that the Caucasus is a very 
complex region and requires a more thoughtful, considered, very 
wise approach. Russia is a great country. And the Caucasus has 
been part of it for more than 200 years -- be it czarist Russia 
or the USSR, in which the Russian Federation was dominant. And 
Russia should have the same attitude to all the republics of the 
Caucasus. If there is a slant in one direction or another, it 
will lead to complications, and, naturally, the loss of its 
prestige in the region. There should, I repeat, be a very 
carefully considered approach, irrespective of whether Russia 
had closer historical links with one people, irrespective of 
religion. It seems to me that Russia will then have more 
prestige in the Caucasus, and the Caucasus will be assured of 
greater tranquillity. And greater tranquillity in the Caucasus 
means greater tranquillity in Russia. 
  [Alekseyev] For two years now the former republics have been 
trying to resolve the problem of the severance of ties in the 
post-Soviet area within the framework of the CIS. How do you 
assess that organization's activity and future? 
  [Aliyev] The organization has a future, I believe. It is 
needed so that each republic can develop more successfully. 
That was why, when I became leader of Azerbaijan, I made great 
efforts to create an atmosphere of trust in the CIS and the 
right conditions for joining the Commonwealth. 
  To tell the truth, it was not easy. By virtue of various 
circumstances, a very negative attitude to the CIS had developed 
in Azerbaijan. I am not saying everyone felt that way, but the 
vast majority did. First and foremost, the events of 20 January 
1990 had very serious moral effects on the people. On the other 
hand, the People's Front, while in power, vigorously cultivated 
anti-Russian sentiments. So it took some months to overcome 
those sentiments in the public consciousness. And on 24 
September last year we joined the CIS. I think it was a 
necessary and important step, and Azerbaijan should remain in 
the CIS in future. But as for the Commonwealth's practical 
activity, I would not say the organization has really become 
established or is functioning properly as yet. It seems somehow 
that during the meetings of heads of state, which last a day and 
a half or two days, the CIS exists, but in the intervals between 
meetings it does not. Therefore, in my view, very energetic 
measures are needed to enable the CIS to function more 
successfully. 
  [Alekseyev] And what does that require? Some kind of 
supranational structures, perhaps? 
  [Aliyev] I do not consider that expedient. That implies the 
resurrection of a unified state, the possibility of impinging on 
national interests. The former republics are now independent 
states, and they cannot agree to that. But it is essential to 
have closer integration. 
  [Alekseyev] Previously, in the USSR, much was said about 
the friendship of peoples. In the CIS, they discuss every 
question under the sun expcept for this one. Does it not seem 
to you that now, of all times, this is what is needed? 
  [Aliyev] The question is indeed very important. At the 
meeting in Ashkhabad [Ashgabat], I stated officially that I 
consider it abnormal to have a situation whereby two states 
belonging to one alliance fight among themselves. But I got no 
response. A second time, in Moscow on 15 April, I again raised 
the question of how the CIS was created for the purposes of 
uniting to defend the interests of our alliance, which is why it 
is unacceptable for two members of the alliance to fight among 
themselves, and that such a thing had never been seen in world 
practice. And again this question was not discussed. But you 
know, alongside military and economic aspects, the CIS needs a 
moral climate: What is needed is the strengthening of the 
friendship of peoples as a means of avoiding future conflicts 
and hostility toward one another. The CIS should extend its 
functions to the humanitarian sphere too, to the strengthening 
of mutual relations between nations and peoples, but in order to 
do this it is necessary for mutual relations inside the CIS 
itself to be warm and friendly. 
  [Alekseyev] In your short time as president, you have shown 
exceptional diplomatic energy. How would you describe 
Azerbaijan's political orientation in the international arena? 
  [Aliyev] I deem it a success that I managed to turn around 
criticism of mutual relations between the Russian Federation and 
Azerbaijan toward a positive direction. I met with B. Yeltsin 
and V. Chernomyrdin and other officials, we signed a number of 
very important documents, and we joined the CIS. That is, my 
first steps were aimed at restoring good relations with Russia. 
And this policy will continue: For Azerbaijan, Russia is both 
a close neighbor, and a large country with which the lives of 
many of the republic's citizens, living both in Azerbaijan and 
Russia, are linked. 
  Naturally, we favor the establishment of friendly relations 
with all neighboring countries -- with Turkey, for instance. 
These relations were good before, but my visit to Turkey, and 
the treaty we signed, strengthened our relations still further. 
Another neighbor is Iran -- we have a very long common border, 
and traditional links. Admittedly, the previous leadership did 
not accord the necessary significance to relations with Iran, 
and a certain tension arose in our relations. But during a 
visit to Baku by President Rafsanjani in October, we signed a 
number of documents. 
  Georgia is also our neighbor -- 600,000 Azerbaijanis live 
there -- and President Shevardnadze also visited us. 
  As for other countries, as we move along the road toward 
building a democratic, rule-of-law state, so we have a great 
need to develop relations with Western countries with traditions 
and experience in the sphere of democracy and a market economy. 
Therefore, I accepted an invitation from the leaders of Great 
Britain and France, John Major and Francois Mitterrand, to visit 
those states, and we had fairly fruitful talks. 
  [Alekseyev] You spend a great deal of time on foreign 
policy, problems within the republic, the Karabakh conflict.... 
Who helps you in doing so? From the sidelines, just one figure 
is visible above Azerbaijan's entire political horizon -- 
President Geydar Aliyev.... 
  [Aliyev] I have already said that I did not return to Baku 
at my own volition and I did not plan to get involved in 
politics. This probably sounds rather high-flown, but the people 
called me. Therefore, I did not bring any team of my own with 
me, nor did I prepare one. Admittedly, I know Azerbaijan well, 
but I left in 1982 -- in this time, an entire generation of 
leaders has been replaced. I have no party of my own, I work 
with the people who are there now. 
  [Alekseyev] What would you like to say to ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
readers? 
  [Aliyev] I want them to know one thing: I, as president, 
will put all my effort into this job, and I will strive for 
friendly relations with Russia.

<F P=106> ["Statement by the Democratic Association `Ukrayina' </F>
Regrading the Deployment of Russian Cossack Formations in the 
Crimea"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Having opted for independence, the Ukrainian people 
have right away encountered a whole series of complex problems 
on the road to establishing the statehood. Against the general 
background of economic crises, the slow advancement of reforms, 
and the flourishing corruption and crime -- features that are 
more or less typical of all newly created states on the 
territory of the former USSR, Ukraine stood out as an island of 
stability and peace. This Ukrainian reserve and solid stability 
did not suit certain political forces outside Ukraine, in 
particular (and mainly) in Russia. 
  Our northern neighbor does not want to content himself with 
the preliminary results of putting pressure upon Ukraine -- the 
constant inflating of the Crimean issue and the creation and 
exacerbation of the "Crimean problem." With the criminal 
experience gained in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and the Dniester 
Region, Russia is deliberately exercising it on the territory of 
Ukraine. Let us recall: From the very beginning of the war in 
the Dniester Region, Russian Cossacks were actively deployed 
there. Two years ago, during an exacerbation of the Black Sea 
Fleet problem, aliens with whips already marched through the 
streets of our Crimean towns. At that time, war could be 
avoided. However, since that time, training courses and marches 
of Russian Cossacks in the south and east of our country have 
been repeatedly held and formations have been created that 
adhere to the laws of the Russian Federation and protect its 
interests. A few days ago, paramilitary formations of the 
foreign state impertinently held their conference -- the 
so-called "great circle" -- on our territory; they guard the 
Crimean antistate and anti-Ukrainian parliament, and they make 
trouble and rape women. We demand that Ukrainian citizens be 
protected from corrupt and armed aliens. 
  We stress that the formation, development, actions, and 
financing of the Russian cossackdom are under the immediate 
protection of the Russian Government. That is why we consider 
the Cossacks' arrival on our territory as Russia's interference 
in Ukraine's internal affairs. Particularly, since Ukrainian 
laws forbid the existence and stay of paramilitary public 
formations on our territory. 
  We demand the following: 
  1) From Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; to 
immediately submit a note of protest to the Russian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in connection with the deployment of Russian 
Cossacks in the Crimea and Russia's active interference in 
Ukraine's internal affairs; 
  2) From the Ministry of Internal Affairs; to expel Russian 
Cossacks from Ukraine and to put criminals from their formations 
on trial in accordance with the Ukrainian legislation; 
  3) From the State Committee for Borders; an urgent 
toughening of control over the situation at the border and the 
introduction of visas for entering Ukraine in order to put an 
end to the influx of criminals and to prevent the import of 
narcotics and weapons. 
  The passivity of power structures in the given question will 
be regarded by the "Ukrayina" Democratic Association as an 
encouragement of anti-Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces and as 
the involvement of Ukraine's governmental circles in stirring up 
separatism in the state. 
  The statement was adopted at the conference of 
plenipotentiary representatives of the Democratic Association 
"Ukrayina."
