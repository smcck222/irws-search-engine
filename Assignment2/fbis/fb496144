  [Text] The Crimean parliament continued today the debate on 
the status of the Crimean Supreme Council deputy. Members voted 
against the amendment requiring them to be guided in their work 
not only by the law, but by their conscience. They also 
rejected the amendment requiring them to take an oath of loyalty 
to the people of Crimea. However, the majority voted to allow 
deputies to carry personal weapons.

  [Text] The Georgian United Republican Party parliamentary 
faction has categorically protested the introduction of the 
Russian parachute regiment stationed in Gudauta (Abkhazia) to 
the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. 
  The faction, which includes 21 deputies, circulated a 
statement saying that this very regiment was fighting against 
the Georgian Armed Forces in Abkhazia and was the first to come 
to Sukhumi. 
  Deputy Jaba Ioseliani said in parliament today that under a 
special Russian-Georgian agreement the Gudauta regiment would 
not be brought to the security zone on the Inguri River. 
  Ioseliani intended to meet Russian First Deputy Defense 
Minister Georgiy Kondratyev on June 15 in order to discuss the 
details of implementation of the peacekeeping operation in the 
conflict zone.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Yesterday, 13 June, 
Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze received a World Bank 
delegation led by the head of the bank's Europe and Central Asia 
department, Mr. Blinkhorn. 
  The Georgian leader briefed guests on the current situation 
in the republic, stressing that as a result of reforms that had

privatization would create a real basis for the development of 
business. 
  For their part, World Bank representatives said that their 
program envisaged rendering aid to Georgia in the near future, 
particularly for the winter season. The program also envisaged 
investment in the republic and the provision of technical 
assistance initially to Tbilisi, Poti, and Batumi, and later to 
other regions. 
  The head of state thanked delegation members for their 
interest in Georgia and assured them of all-round assistance 
from the republic's government.

  [Text] Sukhumi June 15 TASS--Demining of the Abkhazian 
territory, where according to experts some 100,000 mines have 
been placed in two years of ethnic war, is the most complicated 
task of the first stage of deploying Russian peace-keepers in 
the region and its implementation will take a very long time. 
  "In two years of combat activities a huge amount of mines 
and 
explosives has been placed. There are no mining maps and 
sappers face a hard job which will last for several months", 
Deputy Defence Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, who is in charge of 
the peace-keeping operation, told TASS on Wednesday. 
  However, military experts believe the complete demining of 
Abkhazia will take years as the number of mines in the region 
exceeds that in another "hot spot", the Dniester region in 
Moldavia [Moldova], where demining has been going on for two 
years. According to experts, 40,000 mines have been placed along 
the Gumista River in Abkhazia. 
  Sappers will first begin working in places where command 
posts of the peace-keepers will be situated. The unified 
headquarters will be located in Sukhumi in the sanatorium of the 
Moscow Military District. The headquarters of the Western 
control group will be deployed in the city of Zugdidi. 
  After demining of the command post sites is completed, 
Russian paratroopers will begin deployment along the Inguri 
River which divides Georgia and Abkhazia. The warring units are 
to withdraw 12 kilometres from the river and concentrate their 
units and armoured vehicles in specified places.

  [Text] Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador in Moscow, has said 
that the Korean [choson] Government withdrew from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] because this agency's 
Board of Governors had recently adopted a resolution on the 
North Korean issue. 
  During a news conference, Ambassador Son Song-pil stressed 
that the IAEA Board of Governors' adoption of the resolution 
meant, in reality, the start of sanctions against the DPRK. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil also declared that imposing 
sanctions 
against Pyongyang and convening an international conference on 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula were in no way 
compatible.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- "North Korea does not have a 
nuclear bomb. There might have been insignificant research 
developments in this field which have most likely started the 
conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency," a Russian 
top official said. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the Russian-American press 
centre in Moscow on Wednesday, Lev Ryabev, first deputy minister 
of nuclear engineering, denounced North Korea's decision to 
withdraw from the IAEA. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that this step is North 
Korea's response to the threat of sanctions made by other 
members of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Ryabev 
believes that the nuclear problem in North Korea could be solved 
by peaceful, diplomatic means. 
  Speaking about the possibility of shutting down Russian 
nuclear power plants which use Chernobyl-type reactors, Ryabev 
noted that some of them will be modernised, others reequipped in 
order to increase their safety.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun [TASS] -- The treaty on the basis of 
friendly relations between the Russian Federation and the SRV, 
which had been prepared for signing by the Russian and 
Vietnamese governments, will not be signed today, an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent has been told by circles close to the Russian 
Government. 
  According to sources close to the Vietnamese delegation, the 
questions of the United Nations' role in the world and Vietnam's 
debt to Russia, following its succession from the former USSR, 
still need to be agreed upon. 
  According to Vietnamese sources, questions of the 
prospecting 
and joint extraction of oil and gas by the "Vetsovpetro" 
enterprise and problems of the Vietnamese community in Russia 
also remain unsolved. Nor has agreement been reached on the 
question of the base at Cam Ranh, as Vietnam has put forward a 
proposal to review the conditions of its lease.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- If the world community introduced 
sanctions against North Korea this would be an extremely 
unfavorable turn of events, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said today answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's 
questions after meeting the Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen 
Manh Cam. 
  The head of the Russian foreign political department 
recalled 
that Russia had put forward a proposal to convene a multilateral 
conference on the security and non-nuclear status of the Korean 
peninsula, and it is currently being debated along with other 
ideas. There is a proposal to introduce sanctions. We believe 
that, unfortunately, this can happen but this would be an 
extremely unfavorable turn of events, as much as the DPRK's 
complete break with the nuclear nonproliferation regime, the 
Russian minister said. 
  That is why, he continued, we propose to hold a conference 
so 
that one does not have to resort to these extreme measures, 
although, of course, the situation is very alarming and the 
announcement of the DPRK leaving the IAEA is a highly negative 
event. 
  I must say, Kozyrev added, that IAEA guarantees are 
enshrined 
in the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and not 
in an agreement with the IAEA itself. I do not think that 
everything has already been lost and hope that the door is still 
ajar. That is why we think that the conference might give an 
opportunity to all its participants, including the DPRK, to find 
a better solution than the decision to break the 
nonproliferation regime, which will make confrontation with the 
world community unavoidable.

Vitaliy Churkin is flying to London today to discuss the whole 
range of problems connected with ways to settle the conflict in 
former Yugoslavia. He is expected to hold talks with

Demurin, deputy head of the Information and Press Department of 
the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. 
  "The visit is to be viewed in the context of the overall 
efforts of the Russian Federation aimed at finding ways to a 
peaceful settlement in the region and at preparing a second 
meeting on Bosnia between the foreign ministers of Russia, the 
United States, and five countries of the European Union. The 
Russian side put forward the initiative to hold such a meeting 
some time ago," Demurin said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic said in Moscow on Wednesday that Russia had an 
objective attitude and was strongly and sincerely committed to 
peace in Bosnia, unlike the United States which he said was 
favouring the Bosnian Moslems and was, deplorably, not sincerely 
for peace. 
  Winding up his visit to Moscow, Karadzic said that Russia 
was 
not siding with the Serbs, but understood the Serbs' problems 
and was striving to find solutions which would be equally just 
or equally unjust to all three parties to the Bosnian conflict. 
  Speaking to Yugoslav reporters in Moscow, Karadzic asked 
whether it was possible to reach peace if only one side -- viz. 
the Serbs -- was working for it. He wondered that individual 
circles in the United States were supporting the fundamentalist, 
pro-Iranian regime in Sarajevo. 
  They have not only caused the war in Bosnia, but are keeping 
it alive with their skillful game of imposing unacceptable 
solutions on the Serbs and then accusing them of prolonging the 
war, Karadzic said and added that the Serbs did not want Russia 
to enter into a confrontation with the West because of them. 
  He explained that the Russian Parliament understood that the 
Serbs' peace efforts were sincere, that they had made better 
offers at the latest talks in Geneva, but had finally accepted a 
compromise for the sake of peace, even if it had to be for only 
a month. 
  At Geneva, the Bosnian Serb side had offered a ceasefire for 
a year, the international community proposed one for four 
months, but the Moslems and Croats, after painstaking 
negotiations, finally agreed to only a month's suspension of 
hostilities. 
  Karadzic said that the size of territory in the division of 
Bosnia was not the biggest problem in the matter of territorial 
delimitations, and that the Serbs were willing to agree to the 
offer of 49 percent of Bosnia (as against 51 percent for the 
Moslem-Croat federation) if they were given the right quality of 
territory. 
  He said that agreement could easily be reached if, for 
example, the Serbs were to get Sarajevo and Tuzla, but added 
that percentages as a means of dividing territory should be 
abandoned. 
  The important thing is that both the Moslem-Croat federation 
and the Bosnian Serb republic should be viable states, he 
explained. The Serbs are taking into consideration the Moslems' 
need to have a compact state, and the international community 
must take the same approach to the Serb state, he added, 
insisting that the Bosnian Serb state must not be scattered 
around like five Nagorno-Karabakhs, but that it too must be 
compact.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Interview with Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan </F>
Karadzic by Sergey Moshechkov: "Are the Politicians in Bosnia 
Really Going to Become Psychotherapists Again? In Conversation 
with Your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Correspondent, Bosnian Serb 
Leader Radovan Karadzic Was Extremely Frank"] 
  [Text] Until the beginning of the nineties, Radovan 
Karadzic was not well known in Yugoslavia. He was known in 
medical circles as a promising psychiatrist. Lovers of Serbian 
poetry used to read his sometimes very interesting doggerel. 
Karadzic's name could also be heard in sporting circles: He 
worked as a psychotherapist for the well-known Yugoslav soccer 
clubs Red Star and Sarajevo. 
  Now everyone in the Balkans knows him. And not only in the 
Balkans. 
  To some he is virtually an international criminal. To 
others, a fighter for his people's liberation. But no matter 
how diametrically opposed the assessments of the Bosnian Serb 
leader's actions may be, you cannot deny the obvious. 
  During the three years of the Yugoslav crisis Dr Karadzic 
has 
matured as a politician, possessing qualities essential for that 
job: diplomacy and toughness, tolerance and flexibility. He 
knows when to "beat the drum," when to "back off," and how to 
smile even when saying a categorical "no, never." 
  The Russian authorities tried for a long time not to notice 
the leader of the self-proclaimed Serb Republic in Bosnia and 
were happy to allow the Russian opposition the right to make 
contact with him first. Today the leaders of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, the chairmen of the State Duma and the 
Federation Council, and the top church hierarchy are in contact 
with R. Karadzic. During his present visit to Moscow he hopes 
to gain admission to the Kremlin. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA managed to talk with R. Karadzic after 
his talks with A. Kozyrev, who told him unambiguously that 
Moscow has no intention of showing the Bosnian Serbs any favor. 
However, Karadzic did not take offense at that. And he 
answered our questions patiently. 
  He began by talking about himself. 
  [Karadzic] I am 49. Before the war I had a good 
professional practice and I considered myself quite a wealthy 
man. My wife is also a psychotherapist. We spent a long time 
learning our craft -- in the United States and Britain. Our 
children decided to follow in their parents' footsteps. My 
daughter is completing her medical training and my son is just 
starting out now. Admittedly they are not very fond of 
studying. My daughter is working at a press center, my son is 
serving in the police reserve. We all live in our "Serb 
Sarajevo" -- Pale, the capital of the Serb Republic in Bosnia. 
  Before the war I was a very fortunate man. I had a happy 
family, good friends, a job that I liked, and poetry for my 
soul. I was keen on soccer, especially when I was working with 
our soccer clubs. 
  I took virtually no part in politics. I belonged to the 
Communist Party in my early youth -- we were enrolled in it 
without being asked. As I grew older I considered myself a 
dissident, although I did not take part in any actions. 
  However, my friends and I could not remain indifferent when 
Yugoslavia disintegrated. In Bosnia the old ideology of World 
War II began to be revived, but with the introduction of a new 
and very dangerous element -- Islamic fundamentalism. In the 
forties that ideology led to the deaths of 1.5 million Serbs. 
We really did not want a repetition of that genocide, which is 
why we entered the political struggle in the first place. We 
created a Serb democratic party. My friends made me join. Then 
there were elections, we entered parliament, and there was no 
longer any way back to peaceful scientific work for me. 
  Nevertheless, after the war I hope to return to my 
profession. I dream of opening a large, modern psychiatric 
clinic in my homeland together with my friends. Especially 
since staff for that clinic are already being trained in my own 
family. 
  [Moshechkov] Do you see any preconditions right now for the 
establishment of peace in the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Karadzic] The only pleasing thing is that the armistice 
that was signed in Geneva is being observed on the whole at the 
moment, if you disregard local clashes. Generally speaking, the 
situation is quite bad. The Americans are supporting the 
Muslims and are trying to lift the embargo on arms supplies to 
them. But no one has any intention of lifting the economic 
sanctions on the Serbs even though, I can assure you, that would 
be the shortest route to peace. Lifting the sanctions against 
us would mean the complete defeat of the Muslim side's plans for 
our "economic demise" and would also show that the world 
community takes an unprejudiced attitude to us. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does that mean that the economic 
situation in the Serb Republic in Bosnia is desperate? 
  [Karadzic] We are not desperate at all. Our enterprises are 
producing three times as much output as is needed for domestic 
consumption. There is enough fuel and food. There is even a 
surplus, which needs to be sold. 
  The Yugoslav dinar is our basic unit of currency. Just as in 
Serbia, it is equal to the German mark [as published]. But it 
is very difficult to maintain such a situation under sanctions. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] How do you see Bosnia's future? How 
many states will there be here? What will the Serb Republic's 
status be? 
  [Karadzic] It is hard to say how many states there will be. 
But it is accurate to say that it will not be one state. We 
Serbs dream of being with Yugoslavia as an independent federal 
unit or part of Serbia. If that does not happen, we will live 
autonomously. Reunification is inevitable in the future anyway. 
  Just as unification with the Muslims is impossible. 
Incidentally, the world community has begun to understand that 
Believe me, we are not opposed to Islam or Catholicism. But we 
will not allow those religions to suppress the Orthodox faith. 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] The question of the division of the 
territory has been the main issue at the talks on a Bosnian 
settlement for a long time. The Serbs presently control 73 
percent of that territory, before the war they owned 64 percent, 
and you are being offered 49 percent. Will you accept that? 
  [Karadzic] That will depend on the quality of the lands that 
we are offered. Perhaps we will agree to less if we get 
Sarajevo and Tuzla, for example (is that a joke? -- S.M. note). 
  [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What can you tell us about Moscow's 
position in the Yugoslav crisis? 
  [Karadzic] Russia is in a difficult situation now. It faces 
many acute problems. We understand that. And we are very 
grateful to the Russian people for showing us their 
understanding and sympathy. We regard Russia's diplomatic 
activity in the international arena as impartial and 
independent, notably with regard to the Bosnian crisis. 
However, the same cannot be said about other members of the 
world community. Of course we want Russia to be on our side, 
but we have no right to expect that. 
  The main thing, though, is that in Moscow we sense a revival 
of interest in the Balkans. This means that Russia is thinking 
about the future of its borders and the prospects for relations 
with its closest historical neighbors.

  [Text] Bonn June 16 TASS -- "Parliaments of Germany and 
Russia must work hard to elaborate the agreements reached by 
Boris Yeltsin and Helmut Kohl during the Russian president's 
visit to Federal Germany in May," Chairman of the State Duma 
(lower chamber of Russian parliament) Ivan Rybkin told 
journalists on Thursday after his meeting with the federal 
chancellor of Germany. 
  The speaker of the State Duma noted it was his first meeting 
with the head of the German Government and he hopes trustworthy 
relations may be established between him and the federal 
chancellor similar to those between the Russian president and 
Helmut Kohl. 
  Ivan Rybkin also said during the meeting Helmut Kohl and he 
were discussing history of the two countries' relations, which 
"in its greater part was a period of good relations and 
interaction for the good of our two nations." 
  Speaking of perspectives for cooperation between parliaments 
of Russia and Germany, the speaker said he had always stood for 
cooperation to be absolutely specific, that is "at the level of 
committees." At [as received] that, Rybkin said, if need be, it 
would be extremely useful to acquire experience of law-making 
activity of German parliament.

the former Yugoslavia, and NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative are the subjects that are expected to be the focal 
point of Russian- Swiss talks in Moscow today. They will be 
held this morning between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and Flavio Cotti, federal adviser and chief of the Swiss 
Foreign Affairs Department. [passage omitted] 
  Mikhail Demurin, a spokesman for the Russian foreign 
political department, said in Moscow on Wednesday that a 
protocol on cooperation between the Russian Foreign Ministry and 
the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs is expected to 
be signed during the talks. "Since a political dialogue between

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Filippov: "NATO: Its View of Moscow. </F>
Regarding the Results of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
Session in Istanbul"] 
  [Text] The session of the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council [NACC] which was held last week in Istanbul has 
demonstrated both the definite desire of the NATO states and a 
number of East European countries, primarily Russia, to find 
spheres of cooperation in the new situation following the Cold 
War, and also the difficulties of implementing them. 
  The present session is called upon to determine its attitude 
toward the Russian Federation within the NATO system, NATO 
Deputy Secretary General Sergio Ballanzino stated at its 
opening. This question, he said, is the most important one on 
the agenda of this exceptionally important forum. Russia is the 
only superpower in Europe and it will continue to maintain this 
position in the future. We attach great significance to 
cooperation with Russia. 
  For his part, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
indicated certain features in Russia's understanding of the 
position and dynamics of the development of military-political 
structures in Europe. 
  The creation of a new architecture of security in Europe 
cannot take place without Russia's participation, and still 
less, be aimed against it, the French LE FIGARO writes. The 
NATO countries, according to the newspaper, have determined a 
strategy for their actions which would meet two objectives: 
First of all, the establishment with Moscow of a "broad, 
individual, and far-reaching partnership program" based on 
"dialogue about common objectives in those spheres in which 
Russia is making a specific and important contribution." The 
second task, the newspaper believes, is "not to give in to 
pressure from the Russians," who take a dim view of "NATO's 
right to adopt its own decisions." Moscow will not be given the 
right of veto. 
  According to the Russians' ideas, Radio Liberty said in a 
broadcast, NATO should be subsumed into a new collective 
security system under the aegis of the CSCE. This would 
automatically place Russia on the same level as other 
participants in this organization, notably the United States. 
  Having theoretically decided for itself the question of the 
need to strengthen cooperation with NATO, and in particular 
through the "Partnership for Peace" program, Russia, which still 
possesses the acknowledged status of a nuclear superpower, is 
demonstrating its desire to play a fitting role in partnership 
relations with the North Atlantic alliance. Time will tell to 
what extent the NATO leaders will take this into account in 
their strategy.

<F P=106> [Article by Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov in the </F>
"In the World" column: "What I Would Take to NATO"] 
  [Text] If mutual extremism in assessments is ignored for a 
while, the logical question arises: Why, after the abolition of 
the Warsaw Pact, the breakup of the Soviet Union, the 
reunification of Germany, and the pullout of our troops from 
Eastern Europe, has the NATO bloc not dissolved itself too? And 
why, moreover, is it beginning to expand? 
  It is no secret that for several years now the bloc members 
have been casting around for a rationale for its existence. One 
of such "finds" is the Partnership for Peace program, which 
allows NATO to exist in a new, expanded composition, with 
camouflaged claims to establishing a "new world order." This 
can be seen in the obvious attempts to turn NATO into a UN 
muscle force (for instance, in Yugoslavia) and its aspiration to 
control the situation not only within the bloc's framework but 
also in other regions of the world. 
  The invitation to join the program has confronted Russia 
with 
a responsible choice. In the event of unqualified signing of 
the Partnership, NATO's influence will stretch to the borders 
with China, which will not only upset the balance of forces in 
the East but could also revive confrontation with our eastern 
neighbor. If Russia does not sign the Partnership, it could 
find itself in isolation while NATO pushes up against its 
borders. This could be followed by the erosion of trust between 
Russia and the West, which would provide fertile ground for 
restoring the "Cold War." Raising the question of a special 
role for Russia in the Partnership is not the best possible 
option because it is perceived negatively by other partners (due 
to analogies with the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact). 
  The most appropriate option for us would be one which, on 
the 
one hand, would save Russia from an unacceptable choice and, on 
the other, reaffirm its role as a member of the world community 
capable of proposing formulas matching Russia's authority and 
shared by other countries. 
  In my opinion, today the world community needs not military 
blocs but more civilized mechanisms for regulating their 
relations. Such mechanisms exist: the United Narions, the CSCE, 
and others. With some qualifications, the CIS can also be 
ranked among such organizations. But under the new conditions 
none of them is effective enough to ensure real trust and 
security. Therefore, the need arises, on the one hand, to 
improve both the worldwide organization (the United Nations) and 
regional organizations (the CSCE, CIS, and so forth), and, on 
the other, to transform military blocs into peacekeeping 
civilian mechanisms which would become constituent elements of 
these organizations. Herein lies the essence of a bloc-free 
existence of states. And this is precisely what Russia can 
propose. 
  The worldwide organization would attend to general and more 
important questions, while regional organizations would deal 
with specific ones (ecological, economic, social, information, 
security, and so forth), thereby complementing each other. Each 
of them should also have military bodies with peacekeeping force 
contingents which could be brought into action by decision of 
the United Nations or at the request of its regional structures 
at early stages in the evolution of a conflict and also in the 
event of natural disasters, accidents, and catastrophes and also 
for humanitarian deliveries. It is advisable to train such 
(coalition) peacekeeping contingents at special training centers 
in the regions (for action under tropical conditions, in 
mountain/desert terrain, and so forth) with maximally 
standardized equipment and control and support facilities, 
developed on a competitive basis. Therefore the military force 
of various states would have one common enemy: reckless 
adventurism, extremism, and terrorism. 
  Consolidation, let alone expansion, of one military bloc is 
hardly an alternative to this concept. It will serve not the 
creation of a new world order but a unipolar system which is 
unstable by definition. Naturally the NATO bloc today is not 
ready to dismantle itself for a number of reasons. The main one 
among them is the absence of confidence among its leaders that 
democratic processes in Russia are irreversible. But if there 
is such lack of confidence, why then should Russia be confident 
that the Partnership will only be good for it? 
  Russia and other CIS states have done much more in the name 
of trust than all the NATO countries, and more than the world 
community expected. Russia not only closed all loopholes 
undermining trust but is now beginning to retrench its interests 
and its authority. What will come next? It is difficult to make 
forecasts, but they could be deplorable not only to Russia. A 
most reassuring response from NATO would be its readiness to 
reorganize itself as a peacekeeping structure, say, of the CSCE, 
with Russia and other states participating in it on an equal 
footing.

Apollon Lelekhov: "United States Improving Command and Control 
of Strategic Offensive Forces"] 
  [Text] The organizational structure and procedure for the 
command and control of U.S. nuclear strategic offensive forces 
which existed until recently took shape back in the early 
sixties. It was then that the first ICBM's were placed on combat 
standby in the United States. Along with heavy strategic 
bombers, they were organizationally part of the USAF's Strategic 
Air Command (SAC) set up at the time. But, unlike the ICBM's 
and strategic bombers, nuclear missile submarines (SSBN's) were 
not made part of SAC. They were subordinate to fleets operating 
in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Mediterranean. 
  Thus the U.S. strategic nuclear triad that came about at 
that 
time was not a unified formation. Operational command and 
control of ICBM's and strategic bombers was effected by the 
Joint Chiefs through their command centers and the SAC command, 
with command and control of nuclear submarines and their 
ballistic missiles being effected by the Joint Chiefs through 
their command centers and a system of special communications 
aircraft. As for administrative control -- responsible for 
force organizational development, material and technical 
provision and other types of logistics and supply, and combat 
training -- it was exercised by the USAF SAC command in respect 
of ICBM's and strategic bombers, and by the relevant fleet 
commands in respect of SSBN's. 
  Although this system for the organization and command and 
control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was occasionally 
criticized, it existed right up to 1993, when an improvement was 
made to the structure and system of command and control. SAC 
was disbanded. It was replaced by the U.S. Armed Forces' Joint 
Strategic Command (JSC), which is operationally subordinate to 
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. All the combat-ready forces 
of the U.S. nuclear triad -- ICBM's, strategic bombers, and 
SSBN's -- have been transferred to the JSC's jurisdiction. 
  Why did the U.S. military leadership reform the 
organizational structure of its strategic offensive forces and 
abolish SAC? 
  The main objective was to enhance the effectiveness of the 
combat use of strategic offensive forces by optimizing their 
command and control under the new conditions of the disposition 
of forces in the world and the adoption in the United States of 
a military strategy termed a "regionally oriented" strategy 
[strategiya "regionalnoy napravlennosti"]. The U.S. 
military-political leadership has for the first time clearly 
separated the two lines of command and control of all strategic 
offensive force systems -- the operational and the 
administrative. Operational leadership is now handled by the 
Joint Chiefs and the JSC, which control all combat-ready 
strategic offensive forces. 
  Administrative control of the strategic offensive forces has 
not been united. Currently it is exercised in the following way 
-- ICBM forces are administratively controlled by the USAF Space 
Command (which includes the 20th Air Army), and strategic 
bombers are administratively controlled by the newly created 
USAF Air Combat Command (ACC), which organizationally includes 
all strategic aviation. As for the administrative control of 
nuclear submarines equipped with ballistic missiles, those 
functions remain under naval command and directly with the 
Pacific and Atlantic Fleet commands. 
  In the opinion of the U.S. military leadership, this 
reorganization of strategic offensive forces and command and 
control systems should lead to a significant enhancement of 
their combat capability and ensure centralization, efficiency, 
and flexibility on the part of the U.S. strategic leadership. 
  The idea of reorganizing the structure and system of the 
command and control of U.S. strategic offensive forces was 
carefully analyzed and discussed in advance. It was phased in 
beginning in 1991. Measures to enhance the efficiency of the 
system for command and control of the strategic offensive forces 
and the global system for the operational command and control of 
the U.S. Armed Forces as a whole were carried out first. Then 
improvements will be made in terms not only of organizational 
structure but also of technology, taking account of new 
technological developments in the sphere of the development of 
information systems, communications equipment and systems, and 
computers. 
  The JSC Command and Headquarters are located at Offutt 
military base (Nebraska). Planning for the combat use of all 
U.S. strategic offensive forces is carried out by the Joint 
Chiefs under a single -- or, as is sometimes said -- integrated, 
operations plan. 
  That is the state of play with regard to the organizational 
restructuring and reorganization of command and control of the 
U.S. strategic offensive forces. 
  The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 1,000 ICBM launch 
vehicles, including 50 MX ICBM's and 950 Minuteman 2's and 3's. 
They have more than 2,200 nuclear warheads. 
  The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 199 strategic 
bombers, 
including 85 B-1B's and 114 B-52's. They have around 1,700 
nuclear warheads. 
  The U.S. strategic nuclear forces have 30 nuclear submarines 
with ballistic missiles, including 27 with Trident ballistic 
missiles and three with Poseidon ballistic missiles. In total 
they have 600 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and more 
than 4,000 warheads.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia can begin only after a positive decision 
to that effect is made by the Federation Council of the Russian 
Federal Assembly. This view was expressed at a briefing today by 
Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of the press and information 
department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. 
  He said that a reconnaissance group of generals and officers 
from the Russian Defense Ministry has been in Abkhazia since 14 
June with the aim of organizing the deployment of a Russian 
contingent which would be part of the joint peacekeeping forces 
in the Abkhaz- Georgian conflict zone. 
  "Analysis of the situation has shown that any further delays 
in the deployment of peacekeeping forces may lead to 
unpredictable consequences," Mikhail Demurin said.

  [Text] Russia is refusing to supply additional Russian gas 
and raw oil to Georgian oil processing factories. "Extraction of 
fuel and energy in Russia is falling, investments for the 
development of the oil and gas industry are being reduced and 
this cannot but affect our relations with our partners," a 
top-ranking employee from the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry 
reported to the Oil Information Agency. 
  He added that "if there is a surplus, gas will be pumped via 
Ukrainian territory to Western Europe to prevent the disruption 
of exports." 
  A total of 6.9 billion cubic meters of gas are shipped 
annually along the Vladikavkaz-Tbilisi pipeline, 2.7 billion 
cubic meters of which are intended for Armenia. 
  Officials at the Fuel and Energy Ministry recognize that 
shipments of Russian raw oil to Georgia for re-processing in the 
republic are not possible due to the fact that Russian oil 
processing enterprises do not work to their full capacity. 
  Observers believe that this problem can be partially solved 
thanks to the setting up of joint Russian-Georgian ventures to 
extract or re-process oil in the Tyumen region. The ministry is 
ready to render assistance to interested enterprises both in 
Russia and Georgia. 
  "The issue of Russia's participation in the corporatization 
of the Georgian port of Poti cannot be solved positively because 
Russia intends primarily to render its financial support to 
Russian sea ports for their reconstruction and development," 
reported the employee.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Gavrilenko report: "Military Diplomacy </F>
Strengthens Russian Positions in the Transcaucasus. And This 
Has the Region's Support. Those Are the Results of Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's Visits to Yerevan, Tbilisi, and 
Baku"] 
  [Text] How right the wise man was who gave the world many 
centuries ago this brief but profoundly meaningful phrase: 
Everything is relative. He may not have thought then that a 
thousand years later people would use it to assess their past, 
weigh up their present, and look to the future. Thanks be to 
the wise man.... 
  In spring 1993 Pavel Grachev inspected the 145th Motorized 
Rifle Division of the Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus and 
the Gudauta airborne troops. It was then that he told 
journalists who besieged him in Batumi that Russia has always 
had and will continue to have national interests in the 
Transcaucasus. What a hullabaloo that caused.... This elicited 
an extremely irritable reaction from the Transcaucasian 
capitals. What hasn't the Russian military minister been 
accused of! Imperial thinking, aggressiveness, an unwarranted 
incursion into lofty politics.... But Pavel Grachev did not 
counter the insults. He kept himself in check. Since he 
realized that time and events would provide the best commentary. 
  A year has elapsed. And the Transcaucasian states, our 
former Union brothers, have passed this year in an amazingly 
similar fashion. Azerbaijan and Armenia have exhausted one 
another in the war in Karabakh. Georgia has proudly and 
unsuccessfully tried with weapon in hand to get back Abkhazia. 
Ostentatiously turning their backs on Russia the heads of 
states sought patrons elsewhere. It is needless to say 
blasphemous to compare diplomacy to soccer, but I will run that 
risk: Fortunes fluctuated during the game, but the ball is 
round, as they say. And the result is what counts. There were 
no sponsors to be found in the direct sense of the word. 
Cautious advice was provided. And a little help. 
  Aircraft carrying humanitarian aid have indeed begun to be 
heard in the skies of the Transcaucasus, but nothing more. 
People in the capitals of the Transcaucasus have probably begun 
to realize that turning their backs on Russia is tantamount to 
fouling their own nest and flying in the face of history [metit 
pod katok istorii]. And, regrettably enough, one once again has 
to realize that the "notorious" wheel of history cannot be 
stopped. And that Russia does indeed have and will continue to 
have its interests in the Trancaucasus. And there where people 
have always spoken ironically of Pavel Grachev's diplomatic 
efforts and statements, he has suddenly begun to be eulogized 
and his visits to each of the capitals have begun and ended with 
an honor guard and the thunder of a military band. And it 
suddenly became clear amid this thunder that not only do 
Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus really exist, but the 
Transcaucasus states themselves are committed to ensuring that 
the interests of Russia and the Transcaucasus do not wane.... 
  The Russian defense minister's visit to the Transcaucasus 
lasted over three days. In Yerevan Pavel Grachev saw that the 
Armenian leadership has no false illusions as to the nature, 
scale, and intensity of the development of Russian-Armenian 
relations in the military sphere. In their view, tackling the 
question of creating some kind of coalition organ for the whole 
Transcaucasus is a thing of the future. 
  The previous accord on retaining the two base components of 
the Russian Army as defined and envisaged by the relevant 
provisions of the interstate agreements and the norms of 
international law, on increasing the number of personnel, and 
giving Russian troops in the republic greater mobility while 
tangibly strengthening Air Force and Air Defense Force 
facilities was reaffirmed. 
  Tbilisi also clearly manifested a desire to change the 
Russian troops' status to the base principle taking as a 
foundation for this the Russian troops' current stationing 
locations. The sides agreed to set up groups of experts to 
draft decisions on this matter. Pavel Grachev's "drop" into 
Gudauta for a few hours and his meeting there with Abkhazia's 
head, Vladislav Ardzinba, was due to his desire to clarify the 
whole problem of bringing Russian peacemakers into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. That seems to have been done 
and the sides -- Georgian and Abkhazian -- are satisfied. So 
the peoples are waiting for the peacekeepers. 
  In Baku people were waiting for Pavel Grachev to confirm his 
intentions regarding the subsequent development of military 
cooperation. In particular, the Azerbaijanis displayed interest 
in the creation of a common air defense system with Russia. 
Talks on the Russian early warning station can also be 
considered successful: The station will operate; Azerbaijan 
also has an interest in that. As for the Karabakh conflict, 
Geydar Aliyev could not say anything more than that he is ready 
to observe the cease-fire and so the question of bringing 
Russian peacemakers into the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone 
remains open. 
  Those are the results of Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev's visit to the Transcaucasus. Despite the lack of 
concrete accords in Baku, the results can be considered 
successful. The current round of military diplomacy strengthens 
Russia's positions in the Transcaucasus. 
  So are we returning to the Transcaucasus? Perhaps we have 
not even left? At least we have not left the hearts and minds 
of the peoples.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi June 16 TASS -- India is looking into the 
possibility of buying a batch of Russian SU-30 fighter planes. 
A high-ranking delegation from India's military department, 
headed by Air Force Vice-Marshal Krishnaswami, has already 
departed for Russia, ITAR-TASS learned from a reliable source. 
  The Indian delegation intends to visit the Irkutsk aviation 
factory, which produces the SU-30 planes, and to hold several 
meetings with leaders in Russia's defence industry. Indian 
pilots will take the fighter out for a test flight, after which 
the contract negotiations will enter their final phase. 
  According to ITAR-TASS sources, Russia is ready to give 
India 
enough credits to buy 20 SU-30 fighters and to purchase a 
production license for the planes. India plans to manufacture 
them at the aviation factories in Nasik (Maharashtra State). 
This order should help India take advantage of the production 
capabilities it built up for the MiG-27 Soviet fighters-bombers, 
whose production license will soon run out. 
  Indian specialists stress that the Russian SU-30, equipped 
with all the latest technology, is as good as the American F-18 
and the European "Tornado", and is superior to the F-16 and the 
French "Mirage-2000". 
  The Russian fighter has powerful weapons: a 30-mm gun and 
ten 
rockets of various kinds. It is also equipped with the 
capability to refuel in mid-flight, which widens its ability to 
search out and destroy air and land targets.

  [Text] The chief commander of the Russian Baltic military 
fleet has said that the Lithuanian Defense Ministry was supplied 
with Russian armaments in accordance with an inter-governmental 
agreement, denying a number of allegations surrounding the 
transaction. 
  Admiral Vladimir Yegorov in his Wednesday interview to the 
Baltic News Service refuted accusations that Russia has supplied 
low- quality arms to Lithuania. A scandal broke out in 
Lithuania in March after searches were carried out in the flats 
of a number of former Defence Ministry officials and one man was 
arrested on charges of illegal actions when buying the armaments. 
  The Russian military official expressed his regret that 
these 
developments hampered Lithuanian-Russian relations. Admiral 
Yegorov also said, commenting on Russia's transit over Lithuania 
territory, that transit was vital to the Russian troops 
stationed in the Kaliningrad enclave.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Within Framework of Legal Norms"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday the Russian State Duma deputies expressed 
concern in connection with the edict published Tuesday by 
President Boris Yeltsin on urgent measures in the struggle 
against crime. At the suggestion of Deputy Viktor Pokhmelkin 
from the "Russia's Choice" faction the chamber decided to 
analyze the head of state's document at a plenary session, 
having studied the edict beforehand in the relevant 
parliamentary committees. 
  In Viktor Pokhmelkin's opinion the edict contains violations 
of a number of legal norms. During the discussion of the motion 
as to whether the question of the president's edict should be 
put on the agenda, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin stated that 
this document "must be accompanied by the relevant changes and 
additions to the criminal and criminal procedure codes" and by a 
relevant State Duma decree. 
  At the same session the deputies voted to hold a meeting of 
parliamentarians of Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus] on 
the question of the Belovezhskaya agreement and its results. 
The motion on this subject was submitted by Deputy Oleg Mironov 
in the form of a decree supplementing the agenda. 
  A decision was also made to invite Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev to the Duma on Friday to explain Russia's actions 
in fulfilling its peacekeeping mission in Georgia and Abkhazia 
and also Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to explain the 
situation surrounding North Korea.

  [Text] The Russian president's decree on measures to combat 
banditism and organized crime has aroused controversy in the 
State Duma. 
  The Russia's Choice faction will urge the president to 
recall 
the decree, one of this faction's leaders, Doctor of Law Boris 
Zolotukhin told Interfax. Although the importance of combating 
crime is not in question, the decree is at variance with the 
Constitution, the Criminal Code and international human rights 
legislation, approved by Russia. 
  Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party's faction Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy told Interfax that the decree did not cause any 
objections. He noted, however, that it would not work fully if 
it was not supplemented with a State Duma resolution. He 
announced that his faction was drafting a resolution which would 
reduce the circulation of cash to the minimum by introducing 
credit cards, impose a state of emergency in individual regions, 
set up temporary courts for emergency trials which would be 
granted the right to execute the ring-leaders of criminal 
groupings without trial or due process, close major cities and 
banish foreigners from them, and close the state border in a 
number of regions. 
  Leader of the Communist Party's faction Gennadiy Zyuganov 
stated that the decree "grossly violated the current laws and 
neglected the Federal Assembly." 
  Member of the New Regional Policy group, Vice Chairman of 
the 
Committee for International Affairs Aleksandr Dzasokhov told 
Interfax that the time had come to intensify the campaign 
against crime. "However, it must not be based on mass 
violations of human rights," he said. 
  He believes that the president's representative must make a 
proposal in the State Duma on amending the current legislation 
for stepping up measures to combat crime. 
  A leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Concord, Sergey 
Stankevich, said that whereas the importance of a resolute 
campaign against crime was indisputable, the methods listed in 
the decree were quite alarming. The decree gives everyone 
direct administrative access to commercial information, which 
goes against the constitutional norms, he said. 
  Leader of the Russian Way group Sergey Baburin said that the 
decree would give rise to administrative terror. He told 
Interfax that the decree neither defended human rights nor 
created mechanisms for combating crime. He also noted that he 
welcomed the State Duma's decision to include the discussion of 
the decree in the agenda of the next session. 
  Leader of the Democratic Party faction Nikolay Travkin said 
he would welcome the most ruthless measures to combat crime. If 
we fail to cardinally change the situation today, tomorrow human 
rights will be violated everywhere and more seriously than in 
the decree, he said. 
  The president's decree is an anti-constitutional act which 
is 
at variance with other Russian laws, Chairman of the State 
Duma's Committee for Security Viktor Ilyukhin (the Communist 
Party's faction) told Interfax. 
  The guarantor of the Constitution, the president violates 
the 
Constitution, he said. 
  He also urged Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko to 
respond to such violations of the law.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- The State Duma today adopted at 
its second reading the federal law "On State Protection for 
Judges, Officials, and Bodies of Law Enforcement and Control." 
  The law ensures protection for judges, officials, and bodies 
of law enforcement and control whose functions may put their 
safety in peril. 
  Viktor Mironov, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee 
for Security, who presented the law to the deputies, expressed 
the hope that "this law will make it possible for staff of the 
law enforcement bodies to start combating crime in earnest."

<F P=106> [Nikolay Oleynikov report: "The Duma Is Concerned Over the </F>
Right to Life] 
  [Text] Yesterday parliamentary hearings were held in the 
State Duma, subject: "The Right to Life: the Safety of Consumer 
Goods and Services." Apart from representatives of the 
ministries and departments concerned, delegates from consumer 
societies from various Russian cities took part. 
  Not only medics are concerned about the noticeably growing 
mortality of Russians as a result of injuries and poisoning: up 
2.35 times over the past six years. For instance, in 1993, 
51,000 people died of alcohol poisoning -- 4.3 times more than 
in 1987. Many consumer goods are becoming rather a menace. Our 
country is turning into a dump where foodstuffs, consumer goods, 
and household electronics are being brought from all over the 
world which do not meet accepted safety standards, with expired 
shelf life dates. Our own producers are also notorious enough. 
Many departmental laboratories have been closed "for economic 
reasons." If a traditional wholesale merchandiser refuses to 
take a dubious lot, it can be disposed of through small 
distributors. Cunning entrepreneurs have found ways around bans 
and obstacles put up by standardization and quality control 
bodies. 
  What is to be done? Experts with organizations and 
establishments concerned, primarily the Russian Consumers' 
Union, consider it necessary to draft a federal program for 
three years and under this program create a state system to 
monitor the quality and safety of goods and services, based on a 
package of laws and government resolutions establishing safety 
norms for goods and services.... 
  The project proposed by experts is good in all respects, 
even 
the idea of financing the federal program from an insurance fund 
with contributions from suppliers of potentially hazardous 
goods. Of course, money from the treasury is also needed.... 
But the main thing is clear: If Duma deputies like the draft, 
they will put it into action without a second's hesitation, 
taking a major step towards consumers' aspirations. And will 
thus justify this parliament's right to exist.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- A group of deputies from the 
Liberal-Democratic Union "December 12th" walked out of the Duma 
session on Wednesday, saying they will not attend house hearings 
any more. 
  Speaking at a news conference, the deputies explained their 
decision by the fact that on June 13 the Committee for the 
Organisation of Work of the State Duma canceled the Union's 
registration, saying that it did not provide the required 35 
applications by the day of registration. 
  Union member Boris Fedorov denounced the move, describing it 
as a provocation. He accused the Duma factions of the Liberal 
Democratic Party and Russia's Choice of backstage intrigues in 
order to get rid of the "wrong" deputies. 
  He also blamed Russia's Choice faction for actions aimed 
against their own allies. 
  Irina Khokamada, another member of the Union, believes that 
the decision has shown that the Duma is excessively politicised.

  [Text] An official delegation of the State Duma, headed by 
its chairman Ivan Rybkin, set off for a visit to Germany in 
order to study the experience of the German parliament. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent N. Miroshnik] Before the 
State Duma delegation left by air for Germany, delegation head 
Ivan Rybkin said that the program of the trip includes a visit 
to the Western Group of Forces, and a meeting with commander 
General Burlakov. On the subject of providing facilities for 
servicemen, the speaker gave assurances: 
  [Rybkin] The sums in the budget allocated for paying 
servicemen's wages are protected, that is they cannot be removed 
or reduced under any conditions. 
  [Miroshnik] Servicemen in this case, like cultural 
institutions, are put on a level with the least protected strata 
of society -- children and veterans. A total of 40.6 trillion 
rubles has been allocated for defense in the new budget, and, 
Rybkin believes, this sum is sufficient for the normal 
maintenance of the Army. 
  [Rybkin] For the first time in the past three years, the 
Army 
has a firmly fixed sum for its maintenance. 
  [Miroshnik] Furthermore, 1.2 trillion rubles has been put in 
a non-budgetary fund. It is expected that this money will be 
received from the income from monetary privatization. Experts 
believe that the actual income from that will be no less than 12 
trillion rubles, and in this case: 
  [Rybkin] All the income from privatization in excess of 1.2 
trillion rubles will go toward building housing for servicemen 
and toward conversion. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Kyzyl, 16 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "The Russian regions 
are starting at different levels and need differing approaches 
to building their statehood," said Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on the results of his working trip to Blagoveshchensk 
and Tuva at a meeting with the leadership of that republic. 
  "We must not create `standard republics'. They are never 
going to be the same, they all have their own features," the 
president believes. "When implementing economic policy we have 
to take account of the regional particularities of each 
component of the Russian Federation. We will be working out a 
specific line for relations with every republic, oblast, and 
kray," Boris Yeltsin noted. 
  Life in the Republic of Tuva depends on its relations with 
the outside world. Many difficulties could have been avoided if 
ties with the regions of the Russian Federation had not broken 
down. Tuva, the president noted, borders on Mongolia and has 
contacts with China -- these ties must be developed. The 
republic can only be brought out of its grave economic situation 
through pushing ahead with the development of contacts with 
other regions, in part through taking part in the "Siberian 
Accord" interregional association. 
  President Yeltsin stressed that strengthening the Russian 
Federation is the president's most important task. "The state 
must have a single economic space and a single body of 
legislation," he said. "This means opening up unique 
opportunities for every part of Russia on this basis." 
  Moving on to the economic state of the republic, Boris 
Yeltsin noted that basic indicators in Tuva are considerably 
worse than the average in Russia. This means the Republic of 
Tuva is unable to live by its own means. 
  Touching on his working visit to Amur Oblast, which ended 15 
May, Boris Yeltsin said that this oblast should not, by virtue 
of its economic structure, be subsidized. It can get out of 
that situation. But the president is not setting Tuva the same 
task: "The difference is too great between specific indices and 
the people's standard of living. It would be unfair to tell 
them to live by their own means. The people and the leadership 
there cannot do that and nobody is blaming them for that. That 
is how the structure of Tuva's economy has developed. 
Therefore, we must help the republic do enough to bring the 
standard of living of its people up to the standard of living of 
people throughout Russia." 
  Moreover, the president noted, he does not intend to confine 
himself to promises alone, but has given a guarantee to the 
leaders of Tuva that there will be solid assistance from the 
Russian budget. 
  The president called on the people of Tuva to work more 
actively on assimilating market relations and moving the reforms 
forward. 
  He noted the rich natural resources of Tuva. In the 
president's opinion, the republic could supply itself with 
timber and electricity and develop resort tourism. The most 
acute problem for the region in all this is developing the 
infrastructure and transportation links. 
  Boris Yeltsin expressed hope that the population in the 
republic will get their "second wind" following this meeting 
with the president of Russia. 
  In conclusion, the president said that two decrees which he 
signed in Tuva for the development of the economy and the social 
sphere in the republic must be implemented. The president noted 
that the former lack of trust between the center and the Tuva 
leadership has now been overcome and that the strained 
atmosphere among nationalities of two years ago no longer exists 
in the republic. The main thing now is therefore to act 
together to bring the republic's economy out of crisis in order 
to establish normal social conditions for the population of Tuva.

Hour" newscast of the "Morning Cruise" program] 
  [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, has begun his tour of the country 
with a visit to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. The government aircraft 
landed this morning at the oblast center's airport. The 
esteemed guest was met at the aircraft steps by Valiula 
Maksutov, chairman of the oblast duma; Nikolay Dolgikh, first 
vice governor of the oblast; Vladlen Sychev, commander of the 
Army; and other officials. We managed to get an interview for 
our program. 
  [Begin recording] [Bayandin] What is the aim of your visit 
to Sakhalin? 
  [Stepashin] Well, first of all to take a look at how people 
here live and work, including our department here. Now I do not 
know whether or not the president's new edict on the fight 
against crime has been received here.... 
  [Maksutov, interrupts] Of course it has. 
  [Stepashin] Well, that is one of the main tasks. I am a bit 
hoarse from the plane trip, so pardon my voice, but generally 
the president instructed me to go out and see all the regions 
and this is where Russia begins. 
  [Bayandin] Tell us please, how do you assess the work of 
Sakhalin counterintelligence agents in the past? 
  [Stepashin] How do you assess it? 
  [Reporter] Personally I assess it very highly because there 
were some operations involving the apprehension of smugglers 
which were carried out very well. 
  [Stepashin] Well, our assessment is also fairly positive. 
It was formed not only during the Putina operation. What used 
to be known as an open zone, I have Sakhalin in mind, has not 
worked out yet but the manifestations that we have seen from the 
neighboring state and others are being successfully realized by 
our administration, so our assessment coincides with yours. 
[end recording] 
  During the visit the director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service will acquaint himself in greater 
detail with the activities of Sakhalin counterintelligence 
agents and will outline ways for raising the efficiency of their 
work in the future. 
  And so the leaders of two key ministries engaged in the 
struggle with crime have visited our oblast during a short 
period of time. Does this signify that a serious challenge has 
been made to organized crime on Sakhalin? Will the crime 
situation in the region improve significantly?. Well, we must 
wait and see.

  [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS], held a news conference with 
journalists today at the oblast administration of the 
counterintelligence service. During the 30-minute meeting, he 
answered a wide variety of questions. 
  Sergey Stepashin characterized the country's current crime 
situation as critical. Soon the Russian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, headed by Viktor Yerin, and the FCS will sign a 
cooperation pact in the struggle with corruption and organized 
crime. However, the shortcomings of legal and judicial laws 
continue to serve as loopholes through which criminal elements 
escape from retribution. 
  [Begin Stepashin recording] What is particularly alarming 
today are the shortcomings in the judicial system. I remember 
when I was the chief of the St. Petersburg and before that the 
Leningrad administration of the (?KGB) and then the Security 
Ministry. We had 12 cases involving corruption among the 
highest echelons of power, at the level of heads of 
administrations, two deputy mayors, the former director of the 
Baltic Steamship Company Kharchenko -- you may have heard of 
that affair -- and they were all (?thrown out) by the courts. 
[end recording] 
  As far as the establishment of contacts between the Russian 
Mafia and their foreign colleagues is concerned, the FCS has 
already signed a number of agreements on joint cooperation with 
the special services of China, Korea, Egypt, and Japan. The 
director of the FBI will visit Moscow at the beginning of July 
to bridle the rampant mafiosi together with our 
counterintelligence agents. 
  The activities of North Korean citizens on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union also elicit very serious alarm since 
they are, under various pretexts, engaged in a search for 
components for nuclear weapons. 
  In conclusion, Sergey Stepashin told the news conference 
that 
the FCS plans to intensify its activities aimed at strengthening 
Russian interests. Tonight he will leave for Vladivostok to 
continue his visit to the Far East.

  [Text] Head of Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service 
(FCIS) Sergey Stepashin is in favor of extraordinary measures to 
combat crime. 
  Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday in 
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, he pointed out that "a real war of criminal 
clans is beginning in the country now. They use the most 
advanced technical means of destruction. That's why there has 
appeared an urgent necessity to adopt extraordinary measures," 
he stressed commenting the presidential decree on strengthening 
the fight against crime. 
  Asked about the situation concerning espionage, Stepashin 
said that his department is especially concerned at the activity 
of the special services of North Korea. He mentioned the recent 
deportation of five North Korean citizens from Russia who tried 
to find information on the components of nuclear weapons. 
According to Stepashin, three days ago several Korean citizens 
were detained in the Primorye Territory for similar reasons. 
  Having noted the active work of the US special service, 
Stepashin expressed his opinion that "the present level of 
openness is damaging our country." 
  On Thursday [16 Jun] Stepashin intends to visit Vladivostok 
and Nakhodka (Primorye Territory).

  [Text] Vladivostok June 16 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is about to set up a special 
department to detect and detain criminals, FCS chief Sergey 
Stepashin said at a press conference in Vladivostok today. He 
also said the special services of Japan, North Korea and China 
have stepped up their activities in the Maritime Territory. 
  Responding to an ITAR-TASS question about interaction 
between 
the local branches of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
and the local internal affairs authorities in light of the 
president's decree on emergency measures of protecting people 
from gangs of bandits and other forms of organised crime, 
Stepashin said he would sign an agreement with the Interior 
Minister Viktor Yerin next week to boost interaction and divide 
powers between the two government agencies. 
  According to Stepashin, it has been decided to put an end 
"to 
certain competition between the agencies". Counterintelligence 
agents will tackle corruption in the top echelons of state power 
and jointly with the Interior Ministry will trace a number of 
organised criminal groups active in in the field of 
international terrorism and the narcobusiness. The Federal 
Counterintelligence service will help the Interior Ministry also 
by supplying it with special equipment. 
  Stepashin said the president would soon sign a decree 
setting 
up a special department within the service in the centre and its 
territorial branches in the regions of the Russian Federation. 
They will enable the counterintelligence service to take direct 
part in detecting, detaining and destroying those who encroach 
on the law, human life and rights. 
  Stepashin said the president's decree was "very tough" and 
expressed confidence that it would be supported by an absolute 
majority of people in Russia. "But on one condition - if 
tangible results are achieved. If the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
and the prosecutor's office of the Russian Federation fail to 
implement the decree, the question will have to be raised about 
personal responsibility". 
  Stepashin left for Nakhodka today.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 16 June -- Today President Akhsarbek 
Galazov of the Republic of North Osetia met Shmidt Dzoblayev, a 
member of the public chamber under the president of the Russian 
Federation and secretary general of the Assembly of Democratic 
Forces of the North Caucasus, who has decided to act as 
intermediary in dialogue between the Russian and Chechen 
leadership. 
  The leader of the regional democratic movement told 
Akhsarbek 
Galazov that he had talked to the leadership of the Chechen 
Republic in Groznyy on 15 June. They discussed the restoration 
of normal relations with the Russian Federation, the role of 
Chechnya in settling Ossetian-Ingush relations, and ways to 
achieve stabilization in the North Caucasus region. 
  Shmidt Dzoblayev told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev is ready to meet Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and has said so many times. The Chechen 
side is considering establishing relations by treaty with Russia 
and is advocating the creation of guarantees against political 
repression. Dzhokhar Dudayev expressed readiness to promote the 
establishment of goodneighborly relations between the peoples of 
Chechnya, North Ossetia, and Ingushetia.

  [Text] Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said there was no 
political opposition in the republic. "There is no opposition, 
just ordinary criminals protected by Russia which seeks to get 
its way in the Chechen Republic," he said in an interview with 
Interfax. 
  Asked by an Interfax correspondent about the possible aims 
of 
the Russian leadership in Chechnya, Dudayev said it was trying 
to discredit the Chechen leadership, to deteriorate the 
situation. He said Russia was also involved in terrorism, 
sabotage and provocations which Dudayev believed, according to 
plans of Russian politicians, might lead to chaos and collapse 
in Chechnya. 
  Dudayev said Russia was carrying out a policy of aggression 
against Chechnya. 
  "When did Russia put an end to the Russian-Caucasian war? I 
think, it never stopped. The present situation is just a 
continuation of it but in a more sophisticated manner," Dudayev 
said. In Chechnya, aggression, occupation, genocide and 
violence have been going on for 300 years already, he concluded.

  [Text] In Chechnya the head of the opposition Provisional 
Council has declared that the opposition in his republic does 
not enjoy support from Moscow. 
  "Time will tell whom Moscow is going to deal with in the 
future, Umar Avturkhanov told Interfax on Wednesday, but at the 
moment political or economic support for the Chechen opposition 
by Russia is out of the question." 
  He also denied reports that Ruslan Khasbulatov is the shadow 
leader of the opposition and described them as groundless 
inventions. "We ask him for advice in one way or other, because 
he is also worried about the future of his people", Avturkhanov 
said. 
  According to him, the delegation of the opposition began 
talks with Russia with the hope of working out a draft bilateral 
treaty and resolving several economic problems. 
  "We would want Russian federal government bodies to take the 
Chechen question seriously, we want every official to know that 
deciding about Chechen matters he decides about the Russian 
state system", Avturkhanov said.

  [Text] Ruslan Khasbulatov expressed his condolences today 
to the families of the victims of the recent armed clashes 
between governmental troops and a militant group in Groznyy. 
  Today Interfax received a statement of Khasbulatov. For 
instance, the statement said, "I am shocked by this tragedy and 
by the fact that armored vehicles and armored equipment were 
used in the center of a densely populated city." He said it was 
inadmissible to use such extreme methods even when confronted 
with criminals if this could lead to the death of innocent 
people. 
  The armed clash took place last Sunday and Monday. The 
opposition headquarters told Interfax that the governmental 
forces had surrounded the group led by Ruslan Labazanov and 
subjected the residential areas of the district to heavy fire. 
  Such developments followed the order issued by Chechen 
Military Commander Sultan Geliskhanov on the disarmament of 
illegal military formations. 
  The opposition said that from 180 to 300 people had been 
killed during these events, most of them civilians. The 
official authorities said there were no more than ten people had 
been killed and no more than sixty wounded. 
  The opposition headquarters told Interfax that Labazanov and 
200 of his supporters had fled. Labazanov said he would enact 
what he called a bloody revenge on Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev and Military Commander Geliskhanov and on their 
relatives for the innocent people killed during these events.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Fomin] </F>
  [Text] Chita, 16 Jun -- This morning the broadcast on Chita 
radio was interrupted for an emergency report. The oblast 
administration appealed to the residents of the Trans-Baykal 
settlement of Yasnogorsk to maintain law and order. An 
explosive situation has taken shape in the settlement where the 
largest power station in Russia, the Kharanor state regional 
electric power station [GRES] is being constructed. The 
construction workers for the "Chitaenergostroy" [Chita power 
construction] joint-stock society have not received their wages 
for several months. In spite of this, on the decision of the 
federal bodies of authority, the Kharanor GRES is scheduled to 
go on stream this year, nevertheless the financing of this 
facility has practically been stopped. The residents of 
Yasnogorsk have repeatedly addressed a demand to the government 
of the Russian Federation and to the management of the 
joint-stock society of Russia's unified power system that 
overdue wages should be paid, but their voice has not been 
heard. The construction workers' hunger strike which was held 
in the run up to this did not help either. 
  In this connection, it has been decided to stage a mass 
action of protest at the Kharanor GRES. A strike committee has 
been set up here. The power construction workers intend to 
start an indefinite strike, starting 25 June. And today the 
strike committee is planning to hold a rally in the settlement, 
permission for which has been obtained from the local bodies of 
authority. But at the same time it would appear from the 
information coming in from the construction site of the GRES 
that it is not to be ruled out that part of the workforce will 
stage unlawful actions. In particular, the residents of 
Yasnogorsk have repeatedly stated that they will block traffic 
on the railway connecting the Trans-Siberian railway with China, 
using bulldozers, and other heavy equipment. 
  In the radio appeal to the power construction workers, the 
oblast administation which has fully supported the demands of 
the residents of Yasnogorsk regarding the payment of overdue 
wages, has at the same time asked the residents of the 
settlement to refrain from hasty actions. In their turn the 
bodies of authority of the Trans-Baykal region, as was stated in 
the appeal, are taking every measure not to allow a social 
explosion at the Kharanor GRES, to get the power station 
commissioned on time. In particular, the administration has 
sent detailed information about the situation in Yasnogorsk and 
its proposals for extricating the construction site from crisis 
to the president and government of the Russian Federation.

  [Text] "I am confident that a renovated Union will be 
revived," said Vyacheslaw Kebich, chairman of the Republic's 
Council of Ministers, at a meeting with the collective of the 
Minsk Kirov Machine Tool Construction Plant. He underlined the 
special importance of unity with Russia: "Should we be left 
without Russia, it would be our ruin. One should be a realist 
in politics and remember that the wheel of history can only roll 
forward, not backward." 
  Millions of people see no life without a single union of 
fraternal peoples. In Belorussia [Belarus] nearly 
three-quarters of the citizens are for the revival. The most 
consistent supporters of restoring the Union of SSR on a new, 
mutually acceptable basis are Belorussian communists. It was 
they who proposed to hold the next meeting of representatives of 
the communist parties of the former USSR republics in Viskuli 
where the shameful Belovezhskaya Forest agreement was adopted.

  [Text] A session of the Vitebsk City Council has resolved 
to address the Supreme Soviet with a request to consider the 
possibility of holding a nationwide referendum regarding the 
issue of granting official status to the Russian language in 
Belarus. The reason for such an appeal to the highest 
legislative body was a poll conducted among Vitebsk residents, 
which was held by an initiative group. The poll showed that 
5,000 city residents support the idea of holding -- on the same 
day as presidential elections -- a city-wide referendum 
regarding the introduction of bilingualism. Such a stance is 
also supported [words indistinct] by 52 people's deputies in the 
Vitebsk City Council.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from a meeting at the Belarusian </F>
Defense Ministry] 
  [Text] The Belarusian defense minister has held a meeting 
with Collegium members, chiefs of administrations, services, and 
departments of the central administration, as well as the 
leadership of the "Transaviaeksport" air transportation company. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, Colonel General P. 
Kazlowski 
said the election campaign has entered its final stage. 
Candidates for Belarusian president meet with working teams and 
servicemen and present their election platforms and views on the 
current political processes in the country on radio and 
television. They also criticize economic reforms carried out by 
our government in a bid to attract as many voters as possible. 
  To win the trust of the general public, they often resort to 
various tricks. Sometimes, not only are they untactful toward 
each other, but they also cast shadow on entire public groups, 
including the Armed Forces and their leadership. Facts, 
arguments, and proof mean nothing to them. What matters to them 
is smearing everything with black paint and adding as much 
slander and even lies as possible. These are the kinds of 
weapons they fight with. 
  The reason for this may be that teams of some candidates 
include people of dubious reputation. Unfortunately, their 
instructions are indiscriminately used in public appearances. 
  The Defense Ministry, Colonel General P. Kalzowski said, 
closely watches the election debates and will certainly react to 
attacks targeted at it. The objective of all commanders, staff 
officers, and educational structures is to help the personnel 
listen to televised addresses by the presidential candidates, 
carefully study them, and select the best one. It stands to 
reason that the future president will have to care for Belarus, 
its Armed Forces, and the people's well-being. Therefore, he 
should have a broad life experience, an extensive professional 
background, and have good organizational and personal skills. 
He should be a man who instead of wasting his breath, will 
wisely and consistently conduct socioeconomic transformations 
and protect the security of his country. 
  Lieutenant General N. Churkin, General Staff chief and first 
defense minister, presented a report at the meeting. He 
stressed that the Armed Forces is a state institution. The Army 
properly performs its constitutional duties, reliably protecting 
boundaries of its Homeland. Complying with the law, all 
servicemen will participate in the presidential elections. And 
they do care who will occupy the highest post in the state. 
This is why one needs to meet people constantly to explain to 
them the presidents' programs, and to help them properly 
understand the current situation so that the servicemen make the 
right choice. 
  Reports were also made by A. Tushinskiy, first deputy 
defense 
minister; Lieutenant General A. Zuyev, deputy defense minister 
for logistics; Major General A. Sikora, deputy defense minister 
for military construction and housing; Major General V. 
Lepeshinski, chief of the Engineering Troops Administration; 
Colonel V. Chekov, chief of the Relations and Information 
Administration; and other officials who expressed their attitude 
toward populist and groundless statements by some presidential 
candidates about the Armed Forces, and presented their proposals 
for involving servicemen, the full-fledged Belarusian citizens, 
in election campaign events. 
  The Defense Ministry Collegium adopted a declaration. It 
also examined other important issues.

  [Text] Belarus will sharply reduce grain imports this year. 
Last year it imported 1.6 million tons of grain. 
  Deputy Minister for Bread Products Mikhail Petrashkevich 
told 
INTERFAX that since the beginning of the year, Belarus had 
imported only 287,000 tonnes of grain (including 87,000 tonnes, 
purchased by the Ministry for Bread Products and 200,000 tonnes 
by individual enterprises). Grain is mostly imported from 
Denmark, Germany and France at $105 to $120 for a tonne. In 
addition, 5,000 tonnes of grain were bought in the Krasnodar 
Region and 15,000 tonnes in the Stavropol Territory. 
  Petrashkevich said that grain imports were reduced due to 
sharp cuts in the production of mixed fodder. Moreover, the 
population prefers to buy cheap rye bread (previously, wheat was 
the main import item.) 
  In 1993, Kazakhstan was the biggest grain supplier of 
Belarus 
(1 million tonnes). The other CIS countries exported a total of 
600,000 tonnes of grain to Belarus. 
  Petrashkevich noted that Belarus did not care from which 
country it imported grain. Whereas last year, Kazakhstan 
exported grain to Belarus at reduced prices, this year, the 
Kazakh Government is demanding $110 for a tonne on the condition 
that payment is made in advance. Wheat ranks first in 
Belarusian grain imports (about 600,000 tonnes a year). 
Observers estimate that as in 1993, Belarus is to harvest about 
60,000 tonnes of grain this year. The entire grain crop is to 
amount to 7-8 million tonnes, compared to almost 7.7 million 
tonnes in 1993.

  [Text] Russian oil and gas will be supplied to Belarus 
duty free. This is the essence of a resolution, which has been 
adopted by the Government of the Russian Federation. The 
document, signed by Viktor Chernomyrdin, determines the 
mechanism for facilitating oil supplies, including condensed gas 
[hazavy kandensat] and products of oil refining, to Belarus. An 
assent was granted to the proposal of our Republic to extend 
Russian pricing policies to cover energy resources and raw 
materials to Belarusian economic bodies beginning from the 
moment the two countries' monetary systems are unified. 
Appropriate ministries and committees of the Russian Federation 
have been instructed to safeguard organizational measures for 
implementing this resolution, which is one of the first concrete 
steps toward the accomplishment of the agreement -- signed by 
Vyachaslaw Kebich and Viktor Chernomyrdin -- on the unification 
of the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- After the 
Constitution is adopted, it will be necessary to inaugurate a 
Constitutional Court, declared to BASA Eugen Rusu, chairman of 
the parliamentary commission for appointments and statutes, 
mentioning that Moldova has no organ which could assure that the 
presidential decrees, governmental and other institutions' 
decisions do not violate the stipulations of the Constitution. 
He announced that between June 8th and 9th he participated, 
along with Nicolae Timofte, vice president of the Supreme Court, 
and Nicolae Uncu, vice-prosecutor of the Republic, at a seminar 
organized by the CSCE in collaboration with the Romanian 
Constitutional Court. At the Bucharest seminar, representatives 
of the constitutional courts of many European countries offered 
to give consultations on the organization of the Moldovan 
Constitutional Court. According to Rusu, the former Parliament 
elaborated a draft law on the Constitutional Court, which is to 
be sent to the Council of Europe's Commission for Democracy and 
Justice, whose headquarters are in Venice, to obtain eventual 
notification, and later to be examined by the Chisinau 
Parliament.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- A session of the 
coordinating Council of the "Pro Moldova" republican movement 
was held today in Chisinau. Vasile Stati, doctor of history, 
was elected president of the movement. Arcadi Dziubinschi [name 
as received], one of the movement's leaders, declared to BASA 
that after the first year of activity "Pro Moldova" has about 
500 followers. "We fight for the consolidation of Moldova's 
sovereignty, recognition of the notions of `Moldovan people' and 
`Moldovan language'," stressed Dziubinschi. He declared that 
"Pro Moldova" is not a party-like movement and is opened to the 
representatives of any political formation. "We are ready to 
accept into our organizations even the representatives of the 
People's Front -- of course all those who would reject the 
ideals of unification," declared Dziubinschi. In his opinion, 
"Pro Moldova" is unique because it is the first time a political 
movement has given priority to the idea of "Moldovanism."

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 13/6/1994 -- The Christian 
Democratic People's Front [FPCD] called together yesterday about 
5,000 people in a rally at the Great National Assembly Square. 
Party representatives discussed the social, economic and 
political situation in Moldova. This manifestation of the 
opposition is the first since the 27 February Parliamentary 
elections, said the organizers. It was stated that the economic 
recession, which the present rulers cannot stop, has severely 
affected the vast majority of the population, and the standard 
of living has reached its lowest level. Numerous social strata 
are under the poverty limit. FPCD deputy Eugeniu Garla, member 
of the parliamentary commission for budget and finance, said the 
industrial production for the first quarter of 1994 fell by 28 
percent compared to the same period of 1993, the production of 
mass consumption goods 37 percent and of non-alimentary goods 41 
percent. If this decline continues, by the end of the year 
Moldova's national revenue will be halved, Garla asserts. The 
participants also touched on the problem of freedom of 
expression in Moldova. Stefan Secareanu, editor-in-chief of the 
weekly TARA [THE COUNTRY], a FPCD leader, told BASA that the 
draft law on press due to be debated in Parliament "is the 
clearest sign of the reinstallment of communist dictatorship in 
Moldova." This document "violates a basic human right, that is 
the freedom of speech," Secareanu said. Despite the Chisinau 
Mayor's decree, the FPCD leaders organized the manifestation in 
the Great National Assembly Square. One of the speakers at the 
meeting warned that if celebrations devoted to Moldova's 
liberation from fascist occupation take place, the FPCD 
followers will organize protests.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- Yesterday's 
decision of the Parliament, according to which 24 August was 
declared the day of liberation, is an attempt to present events 
from the point of view of those who call themselves liberators, 
declared to BASA Alexandru Mosanu, leader of the Parliamentary 
Block of Peasants and Intellectuals. In Mosanu's opinion, the 
political aim of this decision was to induce more stress into 
the situation and to rehabilitate the communist occupational 
regime. The leader of the faction considers that the 
parliamentary majority "realizes the interests of those who keep 
an army of occupation on Moldovan territory." Characterizing 
the political situation in the republic, Mosanu stated that 
efforts are being made to reannex Moldova to the Russian Empire. 
"In this context, Parliament's decision yesterday is an attempt 
to falsify history," said Mosanu.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 13/6/1994 -- "The change of 
the national anthem only proves that the leadership does not 
have a diplomatic mentality, because a state that changes its 
anthem is not taken seriously by international organizations," 
stated today in a press conference held by the Peasants and 
Intellectuals Block Valeriu Matei, deputy to the Moldovan 
Parliament. They presented the declaration written by 11 
deputies of the Socialist Party and Democratic Agrarian Party 
demanding celebration of the "50th anniversary of Moldova's 
liberation from the Romanian-fascist occupation" on 27 August. 
The deputies demanded the day of 27 August be declared a 
national holiday. The Congress of Intelligentsia chairman 
Alexandru Mosanu, called the declaration "the beginning of the 
restoration of the communist regime." According to local 
observers, authors of this declaration try to give to Moldova's 
independence day celebrated on 27 August another colour. The 
Parliament voted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Moldova's 
liberation from the fascist occupation on 24 August. The 
deputies of the Intellectuals and Peasants Parliamentary Faction 
also opposed the draft law on press. They called it "the most 
anti-democratic law in any state." Alexandru Mosanu said during 
the press conference that, if this draft law passes, reporters 
will have to work under conditions of dictatorship. Valerie 
Matei stated that "a law on press which admits censorship cannot 
be democratic." He goaded the reporters at the conference to 
appeal without delay to international organizations to obstruct 
the adoption of this law.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- "Commanders of 
the Moldovan Military units periodically raised at the 
Ministry's consultations the necessity for resuming the courses 
of military training at schools," stated to BASA Grigore 
Guritanu, from the Defense Ministry. He argued that recruits 
are poorly prepared for military service. Military training in 
Moldova was suspended in 1990. Guritanu pointed out that the 
Defense Ministry has received letters from former teachers of 
military training proposing to resume these courses. He 
mentioned that the Defense Ministry has not yet begun to design 
projects on this matter. In his opinion, to adopt such a 
decision would mean large financial expenses not only for 
teachers' salaries but for restoring supplies which have lately 
drastically diminished. "Decisions on such matters are made at 
the Governmental level. As to the Defense Ministry, it would 
welcome the resumption of military training in schools, but it 
does not have the necessary financial resources for this," said 
Guritanu. Valeriu Senic, chairman of the Parliamentary 
Commission for Education, stated to BASA that the concept of 
general education is being elaborated: therefore, it is too 
early to say if military training will be resumed in schools. 
"In my opinion, all problems connected to the preparation of 
recruits can be settled in the physical training classes. But I 
will not oppose the resumption of military training in schools, 
if it is legally introduced," said Senic.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 11/6/1994 -- The Moldovan 
Ministry of Interior is carrying out for the third day "The 
Square" operation. Petru Harbur, head of the Chisinau Police 
Commissariat, stated to BASA that the main purpose of the 
operation is to stabilize the crime situation in Chisinau. 
According to him, there was a slight increase in the level of 
crime in the first quarter of 1994. Measures are undertaken to 
detect illegally held arms, criminals from the other regions of 
the CIS who have settled in Chisinau, cases of violation of 
passport regulations and raids on the usual criminal 
hang-outs-bars, casinos and restaurants. According to Harbur, 
the first two days of the operation resulted in a two fold 
decrease in the number of crimes. The police has detained four 
persons wanted by police and discovered illegally held arms. He 
said that forecasts about the efficiency of the operation are 
thus confirmed.

forces.

  [Text] Almaty 15 June TASS -- A Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry 
statement, circulated here on Wednesday, expresses the 
Republic's concern over the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
The situation has become seriously aggravated in view of North 
Korea's decision to withdraw from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "Thus, another spiral has been added to the crisis which was 
brought on by that country's withdrawal from the treaty on 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," the statement said. 
  Actions taken by North Korea of late "do not give grounds to 
affirm that the country lacks a military nuclear programme," the 
statement stressed. 
  "Emergence of nuclear weapons in the northern part of the 
peninsula would pose a serious threat to both regional and 
global stability and security. 
  "This is why Kazakhstan, which has joined the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear state, and which 
comes out in favour of strict compliance with the NPT regime 
calls on North Korea to resume dialogue with the world community 
to avoid a further exacerbation of the situation concerning the 
nuclear problem on the peninsula", the statement said. 
  The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry, positively appraising 
Russia's proposals to convene an international conference on 
security and on nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, with 
the participation of North and South Korea, the United States, 
China, Japan, and Russia, as well as U.N. Security Council and 
IAEA representatives, urged all the sides concerned to show a 
constructive approach with a view to settling the situation.

  [Text] As has already been reported, a NATO delegation 
visited Almaty for three days, led by General Peter Heinrich 
Carstens, chief of staff of the Supreme Headquarters [HQ] Allied 
Powers of Europe. They met the leadership of the Supreme Kenges 
and the Cabinet of Ministers, held talks at the Ministries of 
Defense and Foreign Affairs, and visited military units. 
  A news conference was held today on the outcome of the visit 
by Major General Alibek Kasymov, chief of staff of the main HQ 
of the Kazakh Armed Forces and Peter Heinrich Karstens. The 
NATO general told journalists that after the end of the Cold 
War, NATO is facing many qualitatively new objectives. Foremost 
is the expansion of the security area in the world, 
establishment of friendship with the former USSR countries and 
the Warsaw Pact. The Partnership for Peace program was 
designed with this aim in mind. Kazakhstan has already joined. 
One of the provisions of the program is cooperation in the 
military field. Later this year joint training exercises for 
ground troops will be held in Poland and Holland where Kazakh 
observers are invited to participate. One of the aims of the 
NATO delegation's visit to Kazakhstan is to establish links with 
the Kazakh top brass and learn more about their routine work. 
  As Alibek Kasymov said, nobody dictates any conditions to 
Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan itself now determines the degree of 
intensity of its participation in the program, taking into 
account realistic possibilities of the program's feasibility. 
The NATO delegation's arrival became an important benchmark in 
the establishment of cooperation between Kazakhstan and that 
organization, Kasymov stressed.

  [Text] The National Security and Defense Committee of the 
Kazakh parliament believes it premature to consider deploying a 
Kazakh peace-keeping battalion in Tajikistan. 
  The committee's chairman, Toktar Aubakirov, linked it with 
the Kazakh government's failure to develop a statute for 
peace-keeping forces. In an interview with INTERFAX Wednesday 
[15 June], he said the statute should stipulate the rights, 
duties and privileges of these units as well as every individual 
soldier. "Each soldier of this battalion must serve on a 
contract basis," he pointed out. 
  Aubakirov himself was ambiguous about sending a 
peace-keeping 
battalion to Tajikistan. On the one hand, Kazakhstan must 
comply with its obligations under the treaty on the joint 
guarding of CIS borders. "On the other hand, as a father I do 
not want my son to be killed in an alien country," he said. 
Aubakirov believes that the Tajik people should settle their 
issues themselves. In his opinion the peace-keeping forces 
"imposed their order on Tajikistan in a violent way." 
  Kazakh Deputy Defense Minister Alibek Kasymov told INTERFAX 
Wednesday that his republic was ready to fulfill its obligations 
to guard the Tajik borders. He said that a Kazakh battalion 
numbering 500 servicemen had been stationed in Tajikistan since 
1993. "The peace-keeping battalion is waiting for its turn to be 
deployed. If the Supreme Soviet ratifies the treaty, we will 
deploy it," he said.

  [Text] Prices for oil products have doubled in our Republic 
lately. The price of electricity has increased 2.8 times, 
heating supplies 3.3 times, and natural gas 3.6 times. Prices 
for railway cargo transportation has increased five times. 
Prices for sugar and alcohol have increased two to 2.5 times. 
Consumer goods from state- owned shops very quickly find their 
way to the hands of profiteers, and flea market prices have also 
skyrocketed. 
  At a republic meeting of the Congress of Entrepreneurs and 
Union of Industrialists held recently, Prime Minister 
Tereshchenko said that the price for electricity would be 
approximately double soon. Salaries and wages are worth nothing 
now. 
  Our people are very tolerant, but in many places people have 
begun to show their dissatisfaction openly. Of late, there have 
been street protests in the Aynabulak housing development of 
Almaty because the price for natural gas had been increased 
sharply.

  [Summary] Half of Kazakhstan's population is working in the 
agro-industrial complex. They produce 40 percent of the 
national income, which goes into our country's budget. This was 
said at the general meeting of the Kazakhstan Academy of 
Agricultural Science on 14 June. At the meeting, it was said 
that there are more than 60 soil zones in the Republic that 
differ from each other in nature and climatic characteristics. 
This means that each of the zones should be managed differently 
and use different kinds of cattle breeds and seeds. 
  The meeting also said that the Republic has a developed 
high-fleeced sheep breeding program and created a new fat-failed 
breed of sheep that can do well in harsh climatic conditions. 
It was noted that the Academy of Agricultural Science is 
suffering from a lack of financing. The gross share of budget 
allocations for scientific backing of the agro-industrial 
complex has decreased and comprises 15.5 percent against 18.9 
percent last year. Over a period of five months agricultural 
science has been granted only 34.8 million tenge. The meeting 
raised some other issues related to financing agricultural 
science. 
  Attending the meeting were Deputy Prime Minister [Sergey] 
Kulagin and Sagadiyev, the president of the National Academy of 
Agricultural Science. Also attending was Marat Ospanov, the 
deputy chairman of the Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek, 15 Jun--Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] has adopted a 
policy of protectionism. In line with a decision by the 
republic's government that was promulgated today, import duties 
of 200-400 percent are being brought into effect on imports of 
alcohol, tobacco products, furniture, carpets, motor vehicles, 
and domestic television and radio equipment. 
  According to competent bodies, the duties will also affect 
goods brought in across the border by tourists for personal use, 
even if this is just a single item. 
  Although these measures are of a temporary nature, if the 
decision is to be believed, local businessmen make no secret of 
their concerns. Experience shows that there was nothing more 
permanent in the former Soviet Union than temporary decisions.

  [Text] Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulkhashim Mutalov said that 
the state language legislation was not satisfactorily 
implemented. 
  He told the commission supervising compliance with the 
legislation at its meeting in Tashkent that posters in Russian 
were still on display in many parts of Uzbekistan. 
  He criticized the ministries and agencies which had not used 
the Uzbek language in their correspondence. 
  Mutalov attributed this to the want of national pride and 
patriotism in the mentality of certain officials. 
  Under the legislation adopted in 1990 only the Uzbek is the 
national language while the Russian is regarded as the language 
of ethnic communication. People of over 100 nationalities 
reside in Uzbekistan.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received the visiting CSCE 
delegation headed by Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk 
Group, today. Jan Eliasson recalled that today, 15 June, marks 
the first anniversary of Geydar Aliyev's return to Azerbaijan as 
a leading official after a long time and said that the 
Azerbaijan Government has taken important steps to end the war, 
which has continued for more than six years. He noted that the 
CSCE Minsk Group's close concern for the effort to end the war 
is the outcome of one of those steps. The guest stressed: 
Considering the proposals that have been recently made by the 
mediating countries and the UN organization and, in particular, 
focusing attention on the views expressed by the leading 
officials of Armenia and Azerbaijan, we are making an effort to 
end the war. [Words indistinct], that is the liberation of the 
occupied territories, return of the refugees to their homes, and 
restoration of the primary communications systems. That 
objective can be achieved only if the talks are maintained and 
the cease-fire agreement is heeded. 
  On his part, Geydar Aliyev said that Azerbaijan remains 
fully 
committed to the cease-fire in accordance with the agreement 
that was reached earlier. He said: We have stressed several 
times that we agree with the proposals that have been made by 
the UN organization, the CSCE, and other mediating countries for 
the finding of a peaceful solution to the Karabakh dispute. 
That we agree with those proposals should not be taken to mean 
that we will allow Azerbaijan's territorial integrity to be 
harmed. We support a just peace. We welcome the fact that the 
CSCE Minsk Group has recently adopted that concept in its 
activities. Azerbaijan's leaders have stressed in the talks 
that have been held on the question of the deployment of 
military observers in the region that the Armenians in Karabakh 
should not worry about their future when the Armenian military 
units begin to withdraw from the areas they have occupied. The 
UN and CSCE observers will give all the necessary guarantees to 
them. 
  Altan Karamanoglu, Turkey's ambassador in Baku and 
representative in the CSCE, attended the meeting. Speaker of 
the Azerbaijan National Assembly Rasul Guliyev; foreign policy 
adviser Vefa Gulizade; Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov; Defense 
Minister Mamed- Rafi Mamedov; and other officials also attended 
the meeting.

  [Text] Azeri President Geydar Aliyev favors the signing of 
a comprehensive political agreement, which would solve all 
problems associated with the Armenian-Azeri conflict in a just 
manner. 
  In line with the document, international forces or observers 
will be deployed in the region and the problem of security for 
Karabakh Armenians will be solved, said the president during the 
meeting in Baku on Wednesday with the chairman of the Minsk CSCE 
group, Jan Eliasson. 
  The president repeated the position of Azerbaijan according 
to which it is necessary to observe the cease-fire and achieve 
the liberation of the captured territory of Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev accused Armenia of dual policies towards the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, for example, 
of Yerevan's refusal to sign the CSCE plan for the conflict 
settlement, said the Azeri leader. 
  Eliasson said that the CSCE should act as a mediator in the 
settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict.

Khizi region near Baku and acquainted themselves with the 
refugee situation. 
  "Germany told the Russian government that it supports the

framework", said Dr. Manig, an employee of the political 
department of the Germany Foreign Ministry in his interview to 
Azadlig (Freedom) newspaper. 
  Mr. Manig noted that Germany does not approve of the 
bilateral talks held by Kazimirov, the special representative of 
the Russian President on Nagorno Karabakh. According to Manig 
these negotiations were not discussed with other members of CSCE. 
  Dr. Manig noted that Germany will insist on the settlement 
of both the Karabakh and the Abkhzia conflicts within the CSCE

<F P=106> [Interview with head of state Eduard Shevardnadze by </F>
correspondent Nato Oniani on 14 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Today or tomorrow peacekeeping forces 
will enter Abkhazia. [passage omitted] How hopeful are you on 
the eve of the introduction of peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia? 
  [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] The Russian president and I 
welcome the fact that this operation is carried out under UN 
supervision and with the UNHCR's [UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees] active participation. UN supervision and an active 
involvement and assistance of one of its structures, the UNHCR, 
combined with the participation of Armed Forces from Russia and 
the CIS, which is an interregional organization, create a fairly 
promising atmosphere. This should answer your question about 
the level of my expectations. 
  There is always some doubt before any such operation. I may 
have certain doubts too, especially if our bitter experience and 
the serious lesson we have been given are taken into account. 
But we had to make a choice. I think that the decision that we 
made was the only possible option at this stage. Moreover, as I 
told you, the peace-keeping operation will to a certain extent 
be supervised by international organizations. 
  Returning to your question about whether or not I am 
hopeful, 
I would say that yes, I am hopeful and I believe that this 
operation will certainly be a success. Tens of thousands of 
people will return to their homes. This problem, which is a 
matter of concern in Georgia and elsewhere, is now closer than 
ever to its solution. This is my opinion and my answer. 
  [Oniani] As regards the choice, the opposition has a 
different opinion. They believe that there was an alternative 
solution, which is something that Azerbaijan has opted for. 
Although Azerbaijan faces the threat of losing Ganja, it 
nevertheless would not agree to the introduction of Russian 
troops. 
  Parliament heard today [14 June] that Russian peace-keeping 
forces had already shown their true colors in Samachablo [South 
Ossetia] and Tajikistan. There was also dissatisfaction with 
the planned participation in the operation of the parachute 
battalion regiment stationed in Gudauta, which, to put it 
mildly, was giving us a lot of trouble during the war in 
Abkhazia. It was also said that Georgia was losing whatever was 
left of its sovereignty. 
  [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] It would not be right to 
draw a parallel between us and Azerbaijan just because it has 
lost a fifth of its territory but is still holding its ground. 
Such comparisons are not right because Azerbaijan has its own 
distinctive qualities, resources, reserves, and perhaps even 
some countries behind its back. All this requires a deeper 
analysis and serious consideration. A lot has to be taken into 
consideration before an accusation is made, especially when it 
is made in parliament. 
  I am not in disagreement with the Azerbaijan leadership at 
all. We have excellent relations and we often confer with each 
other. I have nothing to say that would be critical of Heydar 
Aliyev's position. But we in our position had either to take 
the current course of action or that of war.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has not 
ruled out that the position of the Georgian Parliament may cause 
a postponement of the introduction of Russian troops into the 
[Georgian-Abkhazian] conflict. Some of the Georgian 
parliamentary deputies assert that the Russian paratroops have 
been bought by the Abkhazians and, therefore, cannot act as 
peacekeepers. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The peacekeeping operation in 
Abkhazia has been postponed until 26 June. This was stated by 
Shevardnadze at a meeting of the parliamentary majority before 
parliament started work. The opinion of the opposition deputies 
differs markedly from Shevardnadze's point of view about the 
introduction of peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia. 
  In an interview for Georgian television Shevardnadze 
condemned the actions of the opposition and described them as an 
attempt to wreck the peacekeeping operation. Shevardnadze 
expressed confidence in the success of the peace process, the 
first stage of which, the return of refugees to Gali Rayon, will 
begin in the next few days.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- Russian field engineering 
units will be brought in to demine sites in Abkhazia on 
Thursday, in accordance with the first stage of peacemaking 
operation in the area of Abkhazian-Georgian conflict. 
  The announcement was made by Colonel General Vladimir 
Semenov 
at a news conference held in the main headquarters of Russian 
land forces on Wednesday. 
  Russian peace-making forces will be introduced in the area 
in 
accordance with Georgian-Abkhazian agreements and Russian 
president's decree, Semenov emphasized. 
  According to him, at present a task force of the Russian 
Defence Ministry led by Deputy Defence Minister Colonel General 
Georgiy Kondratyev is in the area, making a reconnaisance of the 
sites where the peace-keepers will be stationed and commanding 
points will be set up. They are going to demine these very 
sites. 
  Asked if Russian servicemen will be guaranteed security, 
Semenov underlined that a full guarantee could not be given. 
The main conditions for such a guarantee lie in demining the 
terraine in the 12-kilometer strip and building engineering 
facilities at the peace- keepers' checkpoints, he added. 
  Every effort will be made to prevent losses of Russian 
servicemen, he said. 
  In case of attacks upon the checkpoints run by Russian 
peace- 
keepers, the latter will shoot to kill, he emphasized.

  [Text] In the evening of June 14 Abkhazia cut back by 80 
percent the supply to Georgia of electricity produced at the 
Inguri power station. 
  Vice Premier of the Abkhaz government, Vladimir Mikanba, 
told 
Interfax that this was in retaliation at the acts of sabotage 
carried out by Georgian forces in the Gali region of Abkhazia. 
Electricity cables were destroyed leading to a loss of supply to 
a number of regions, including the capital Sukhumi.

<F P=106> [Giorgi Kalandadze article: "A Representation of the </F>
Austrian Chamber of Commerce Will Open in Georgia"] 
  [Excerpt] On 31 May, [Foreign Minister] Aleksandr 
Chikvaidze held a press conference devoted to the results of the 
visit he and Hamlet Chipashvili, head of the consular 
department, made [to Austria and France]. 
  On 23-25 May, Aleksandr Chikvaidze made a business trip to 
Austria where he met with the minister of the economy and the 
heads of the foreign ministry. A bilateral treaty was concluded 
on the establishment of economic ties. As it became known, the 
Georgian delegation had talks with their Austrian colleagues on 
the allocation of specific credits. The Austrian side decided 
that, in the near future, it would send a delegation to Georgia 
that would include a representative from the Ministry of the 
Economy and the Chamber of Commerce. He will study the 
prevailing situation in the republic and, on the basis of 
information gathered, the Austrian Government will decide what 
kind of credits it might allocate to Georgia. 
  As Aleksandr Chikvaidze stated, the Georgian delegation held 
a meeting with Austrian businessmen including the famous Leopold 
Bausbeck. According to the minister, Bausbeck will render 
assistance to the organizational committee of the "Bisec" 
session. 
  According to a statement delivered at the press conference, 
a 
representation of the Austrian Chamber of Commerce will soon be 
opened in Tbilisi. The opening of a similar service in Vienna 
is experiencing financial difficulties. 
  As regards the opening of Georgian diplomatic services in 
various countries, the minister stated that a Georgian embassy 
would soon be opening in Iran. In his view, it was essential to 
open similar services in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine and 
also in the CIS representation in Minsk. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kaliningrad, Russia, June 15, BNS -- The last 
Russian navy combat ship will leave Estonia by the end of this 
month along with all naval ammunition left in that Baltic 
country by that time, the head of Russia's Baltic Sea Fleet, 
Adm. Vladimir Yegorov, told BNS. 
  The admiral said Russia still had some 800 tons of naval 
ammunitions in Estonia. All this will be taken out from the 
country before the end of the month, if no what he called 
"unpredictable obstacles" will emerge. Also in the former 
Russian submarine crew training center in Paldiski is winding 
up, but it will still take long to complete all the work there, 
he said. 
  Remaining 52 staff at the naval base in Tallinn are active 
shutting down the base. In addition to them, there are 303 
families of Russian officers in Estonia for whom Moscow has been 
unable to provide housing in Russia. An agreement concerning 
such families has been signed with Latvia, but no respective 
document exists for the families in Estonia, the admiral said. 
  Yegorov also mentioned that the Paldiski naval training 
facility with its nuclear reactors was not his competence, but 
stood under direct authority of the naval headquarters in 
Moscow. The Baltic Sea Fleet is in charge of providing the 
necessary technical assistance and facilities for their 
dismantling, as well as taking away the gear. The head of the 
Baltic Sea Fleet couldn't say what was the timetable for the 
reactors' dismantling.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 15, BNS -- The parliament today voted 
down 48 to eight and one abstention the bill of ratification of 
a government guarantee for a loan from the American 
Export-Import Bank, the parliament press office reported. 
  The controversial loan guarantee, referred to after the name 
of the Estonian beneficiary company as the Lekto loan, has 
served as a main argument in the hands of anti-prime minister 
opposition during recent political disputes. The Lekto company 
and America's Western AG Resources in April last year signed an 
agreement on potato farming in Estonia. According to the 
document, the U.S. company was to supply the Estonian partner 
with quality seed potatoes, technologies and chemicals, as well 
as buy the yield grown on 400 hectares in Estonia. 
  The Estonian Land Bank at Lekto's instructions last May 5 
issued three letters of credit worth 1.055 million U.S. dollars, 
payable by the Bank of Washington. The American Export-Import 
Bank, acting as guarantor of the credit, sought the Estonian 
Government's guarantee for the loan. The guarantee was signed 
by Prime Minister Mart Laar May 20, 1993. 
  Shortcomings in the equipment supplied by the American 
company, delayed delivery of the seed potatoes, and choosing a 
sort not fitted for growing in the Estonian climate, led to a 
failure of the potato crop, Lakto says. The Estonian Land Bank 
has turned to an internationally well- known U.S. law firm to 
sue the American company for the damages. 
  The Estonian parliament earlier this month in a 18 to 16 
vote 
turned down the first proposal to refuse to ratify the loan 
guarantee. Finance Minister Heiki Kranich, who by now has 
entered his resignation, then said that in case of the 
parliament's refusal to ratify the loan, the American 
Export-Import Bank will reclaim the money from the Estonian Land 
Bank. Claims by the Land Bank would lead to Lekto's bankruptcy 
and takeover from the state, which currently owns 87 percent of 
shares in Lekto. Lekto's share capital is 4.63 million kroons. 
Kranich then expected the Land Bank to be able to repay the loan 
with money to be gained in Lekto's bankruptcy proceedings and 
from the bank's own reserve. The minister said that if the bank 
fails to manage with money from these two sources, the rest will 
be taken from government funds. The minister said his opinion 
was that the parliament should ratify the guarantee issued by 
the government, as refusal would negatively affect Estonia's 
credibility with foreign partners.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 15, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet 
yesterday ruled that the country will not render flight control 
operations in its upper air space to any foreign country, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said in a press conference. 
  The Finnish Aviation Department early last month delivered 
to 
its Estonian counterpart body its proposals concerning a 
possible takeover of the control by Finnish operators in 
Tampere. The plan was considered because of reports that the 
technical equipment used by fight controllers in Estonia is 
several decades behind the present-day level. 
  The Cabinet today decided that there were no serious 
political or economic grounds to hand over the control and that 
the step would contradict Estonia's responsibilities under 
international agreements. Laar said Estonia will start 
preparation of a long-term program aimed at purchasing 
state-of-the-art equipment for flight control. 
  Operations by commercial airlines in several international 
air corridors crossing Estonia in the upper air space, or higher 
than 6,000 meters above the ground, brought to Estonia some 30 
million kroons in fees last year. 
  "We have been able to ensure flight security so far also in 
the upper air space -- the question is on what level," Jaan 
Tamm, deputy head of the Estonian Aviation Department, told BNS. 
According to estimates by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO), Estonia needs 39 million dollars, or some 
530 million kroons, to update its flight control systems and 
train the personnel.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 15, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet accepted 
Tuesday a free trade agreement with the European Union (EU). 
The Latvian and EU delegations plan to sign the agreement on 
June 20, the Foreign Ministry's EU Affairs State Minister 
Olgerts Pavlovskis said at a press conference. 
  Pavlovskis said that the free trade agreement with the EU is 
very important for the development of Latvia's economy. 
  Pavlovskis stressed that the agreement will not negatively 
influence Latvia's agriculture and industry, because, according 
to the initialed agreement, Latvia will have a transitional 
period for four years during which the import duty tariffs for 
the EU states' agricultural produce will be gradually decreased. 
  The Agricultural Ministry's specialists support the ready 
for 
signing additional protocols to the free trade agreement, 
providing for the procedure of decreasing of agricultural 
products' import duty tariffs, because the agreement itself 
provides for protecting Latvia's inner market from flowing in of 
too much EU agricultural products, said Pavlovskis. 
  The free trade agreement with the EU will promote the 
flowing 
in of foreign investments in Latvia and establishing of joint 
ventures with the local producers, whose produce could be sold 
in the markets of the European states. 
  Pavlovskis noted that the quota for industrial and 
agricultural produce can be revised once in three years thus 
effectively regulating the development of Latvia's foreign trade. 
  The Latvian 5th Saeima plans to accept the free trade 
agreement with the EU in October.

  [Text] A regular session of the Cabinet of Ministers took 
place on Tuesday [14 June]. The almost 200-page free trade 
agreement with the European Union was approved there. 
  Olgerts Pavlovskis, state minister for foreign trade and 
European Union affairs, tells us the following about it: 
  [Begin Pavlovskis recording] The cabinet approved the free 
trade agreement concluded with the European Union and authorized 
the Latvian delegation to sign it in Brussels on (?20) June. 
  That was a long and very interesting and intensive way. This 
document is heavy and [word indistinct] -- both in the sphere of 
Latvian politics and the sphere of the Latvian economy. 
  In this agreement -- we often hear that agriculture will be 
destroyed, industry will be destroyed, and so on. Various 
mechanisms, various protection mechanisms so to speak, which 
will protect not only industrial (products), (when) some sort of 
a critical situation comes about, for example, in a newly 
created sector of industry, but also in agriculture, have also 
been [word indistinct] in this agreement. 
  We have opened the door for Latvian goods to the West. We 
cannot guarantee that the goods will be bought, we cannot 
guarantee the market, but at least we have created conditions in 
which Latvian producers and Latvian farmers will be able to sell 
their products in the West with reduced tariffs. [end recording]

  [Text] Vilnius June 15 TASS -- Lithuanian parliament 
speaker Ceslovas Jursenas swore in five new ministers at the 
morning session of the Lithuanian Sejm on Wednesday. 
  Three of them will be put in charge of absolutely new 
governmental departments founded in accordance with the law on 
cabinet activities. Namely, Bronis Bradauskas will be from now 
on minister of environmental protection; Vladislavas Domarkas - 
minister of science and education (until recently he was deputy 
foreign minister); and Dainius Trinkunas - minister of culture 
(previously, he was at the head of Ministry of Culture and 
Public Education). In accordance with the above-mentioned law, 
there will be two separate respective ministries from now on. 
  Another two newly sworn-in ministers stepped in the shoes of 
their predecessors. Sylviculturist Albertas Vasilyauskas will 
be minister of forestry and his namesake Aleksandras will be 
minister of economics. 
  Almost all of the new ministers are either members or 
supporters of the ruling Democratic Party of Labour.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Rodin from the "Collision" column: "The </F>
President Has Upstaged the Opposition in the Propaganda Contest. 
Although To Do This, He Had To Break the Current Constitution"] 
  [Excerpts] The State Duma is planning to react tomorrow to 
the 14 June Presidential Edict 1226 "On Urgent Measures To 
Protect the Population Against Gangsterism and Other 
Manifestations of Organized Crime." Putting to the vote a 
motion to include the question of the edict on the agenda, Duma 
speaker Ivan Rybkin said that "this edict should be backed up by 
a law on amendments and additions to the Criminal Law Code." 
According to Rybkin, the Duma may either soften or, on the 
contrary, tighten the edict propositions. Interestingly, it was 
the Russia's Choice faction that initiated a public -- albeit 
very weak -- reaction from the State Duma. The president's 
traditional opponents kept silent although reaction in the lobby 
was rather sharp. For instance, Legislation Committee Chairman 
Vladimir Isakov said that the edict goes way beyond the bounds 
of the current Fundamental Law. [passage omitted] 
  However, the most noteworthy part of the edict is the one 
that allows leaders of executive power bodies in Russian 
Federation components "to define lists of cities and particular 
localities which need to be placed under special control 
following proliferating instances on these territories of 
gangsterism and other manifestations of organized crime." It 
can be supposed that in the very near future, in particular in 
Moscow, this special control may well be imposed. It is known 
that an early issuance of the anticrime edict was prompted by, 
among other things, a well organized stream of appeals from 
representatives of the Moscow business community. Will the 
edict help fight the crime that most bothers the average 
man--street crime? Apparently not: Financial checks will not 
stop muggings in doorways and dark lanes. In the final 
analysis, the reasons for the edict's promulgation are 
political. Although some economic rationale can also be seen: 
The actual annulment of banking and commercial secrets is a 
good method of competition. 
  Yet political considerations prevail. The fact is that in 
the last couple of months presidential analysts have considered 
several scenarios for extending the term of the incumbent 
president or, to be more accurate, the political elite that is 
associated with him. The option of making amendments to the 
Constitution consolidating presidential power was rejected 
pretty soon due to its absolute nonviability. The attempt to 
introduce a state of emergency in the economy and through it 
cancel presidential, if not all, elections was postponed owing 
to resistance from the head of government. Presumably, the 
scenario of cracking down on crime was deemed most beneficial 
from this point of view owing to its high propaganda value, 
which automatically strengthens the president's authority: It 
should not be forgotten that crime will be dealt with by 
departments fully subordinated to Yeltsin. 
  Boris Yeltsin's retaining his post so far is advantageous to 
all rival groups around and under him because they are fighting 
exclusively for influence on the president. Therefore, one can 
expect a favorable reaction from regional authorities. The 
Federal Assembly, notably its lower chamber, will need to frame 
the edict, as soon as possible, with corresponding laws: 
Revoking it is impossible for political reasons since that 
would damage the deputies' image. The most that can be done 
with the edict is to tone down some of its more odious 
provisions--on 30-day detention, and so forth. It is 
interesting that the opposition's negative reaction--and it is 
precisely such--must be due to the fact that the president has 
outdone it in the propaganda contest.

<F P=106> [By CRIME-PRESS correspondents Olga Semyonova, Larisa </F>
Kislinskaya, and Yuriy Shcherban] 
  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- The presidential anti-crime 
decree of June 14 is important and very timely. It does not 
infringe upon civil rights and curbs only the rights of criminal 
groupings, a high-ranking Russian counterintelligence official 
said. 
  In an interview with the CRIME-PRESS news agency on 
Wednesday, Yevgeniy Sevostyanov, head of the counterintelligence 
service in Moscow and the Moscow region, said that the decree 
aims at protecting the population of Russia from organised 
crime. "The adopted measures limit only the rights of the 
members of criminal gangs and their direct accomplices." 
  Vasiliy Kuptsov, Moscow criminal police chief, said that the 
measures could have been even tougher. "If the old law does not 
provide adequate measurers against criminals, a new law is 
needed," he said. 
  "We should have resorted to such measures earlier, then 
there 
would be no such orgy of crime and innocent victims of criminal 
score settling," Kuptsov said. 
  "I believe such measures must be used also against other 
people who are suspected of participation in criminal gangs or 
serious crimes," he added. 
  This opinion was shared by Constitutional Court Judge Gadis 
Gadzhiyev. He told CRIME-PRESS that as a means of fighting 
crime the decree should have appeared three years ago. He 
believes the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, and the 
Federation Council, the upper house, must approve the decree as 
soon as possible in order to avoid the unnecessary criticism of 
the decree.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- The Russia's Choice 
parliamentary faction has qualified the Russian president's 
decree "On Urgent Measures for the Defence of the Population 
From Bandits and Other Forms of Organized Crime" as the 
violation of the Constitution, the criminal code and citizens' 
rights. 
  At a news conference held in the Russian State Duma 
representatives of the "Russia's Choice" called on the president 
to suspend the decree. Lawmaker Viktor Pokhmelkin pointed out 
that he proceeds from the necessity to carry out a resolute, 
efficient and step-by-step fight against bandits, but this 
should be done in strict compliance with the constitution and 
should by no means infringe on constitutional guarantees of the 
rights and freedoms of an individual, including in the sphere of 
criminal court investigation, which have been guaranteed today. 
  In the opinion of the "Russia's Choice" faction, the 
president's decree, and paragraph 1 in particular, contains 
clauses which obviously run contrary both to the Constitution 
and the Russian criminal code. 
  In particular, the decree allows to conduct an examination 
before criminal proceedings are instituted with the results of 
the examination considered as evidence. This runs contrary to 
Article 109 of the Criminal Code which says that no 
investigating activities can be conducted before criminal 
proceedings are instituted, except for the examination of the 
place where a crime was committed. 
  It is presumed that no sanctions shall be used against the 
suspects, such as a written promise not to leave the place, the 
release on bail or on security. According to Article 89 of the 
Criminal Code, the settlement of all these problems is in the 
competence of an investigator, a prosecutor or court only. The 
decree stipulates that it is possible to detain a suspect on the 
above-mentioned charges for the period of up to 30 days, while 
Article 22 of the Criminal Code says that a suspect can be 
detained for no more than 72 hours. 
  All this shows that the president has exceeded his 
constitutional powers and practically made addenda and 
amendments to the Criminal Code in effect today, while addenda 
and amendments to the Criminal Code can be made only by law, 
which shall be adopted by the Federal Assembly of the Russian 
Federation, the lawmaker said. At the same time, the "Russia's 
Choice" faction believes that provisions of the Constitution on 
the right of the defendant to defence, the presumption of 
innocence and compliance with the law when conducting a criminal 
investigation have been violated as well, the lawmaker said.

  [Text] Moscow's Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov described the 
presidential anti-crime decree Boris Yeltsin signed on Tuesday 
as "very strong". Luzhkov said he was certain that if 
implemented, it would push down crime rates in Moscow and 
elsewhere in Russia. Mayor Luzhkov was speaking at a banquet 
with US businessmen in the Slavyanskaya hotel. 
  He said that "touring criminals" were responsible for 40 
percent of crimes in Moscow and that the controversial 
registration of foreigners in the capital and improved supply of 
police with advanced hardware had had a certain effect already, 
although there was still much room for improvement. Luzhkov 
said that additional measures were necessary and he promised 
they would be taken in the near future. 
  Asked about the dispute between the Mayor's office and the 
State Property Committee over privatization in Moscow, Luzhkov 
said that he saw President Yeltsin's instruction to Anatoly 
Chubais "not to touch" Moscow as a victory of common sense, and 
not of the mayor. Luzhkov said that from now on property in 
Moscow would not be privatized indiscriminately, and not at next 
to nothing, but for real prices and on a contest basis to ensure 
that Moscow's real estate end up in the hands of real owners, 
and not black-market brokers. 
  Mayor Luzhkov invited US businessmen to be more bold in 
investing into joint projects, saying that in one year Moscow 
was capable of accepting up to two billion dollars of 
investments into all businesses. On guarantees for investors 
Luzhkov said that the government of Moscow had set up a reserve 
fund to compensate for losses that may be sustained by joint 
ventures in case of force majeure.

  [Text] A POSFACTUM correspondent has been told by competent 
sources that the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry [MVD] and the 
counterintelligence service are buying foreign weapons and 
ammunition at the instruction of Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. On the list are pistols, automatic weapons, and 
revolvers manufactured by famous Western firms. Tens of 
thousands of units of ammunition have been bought for each type 
of weapon. It seems that the authorities are set to undertake 
an uncompromising fight against bandits. But what form it is to 
take now can only be guessed at.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first </F>
deputy director of the Foreign Intelligence Service, by 
KRIM-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova specially for ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA; place, date not given: "Our Agents Are Serving and Will 
Continue To Do So!"] 
  [Text] [Semenova] The date 12 June was a holiday -- 
Russia's Independence Day. At the same time it marks the 
adoption of the declaration of Russia's state sovereignty. 
Needless to say, one of the components of any state's 
sovereignty is national security in which the Russian 
intelligence service is involved alongside other special 
services and the Army. Can I ask you to flesh out the 
contribution made by the Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] to 
ensuring that the new Russia really is a sovereign state? 
  [Trubnikov] Sovereignty is primarily security, protection of 
national interests, and an independent and active foreign 
policy. The intelligence service's role in all this is extremely 
important, despite not always being evident -- such is the 
nature of intelligence activity. The present transition period 
in international relations has been marked by rapid changes in 
all spheres of life. This affects Russia in particular. On the 
whole, the trend of world development is favorable to our 
country, but the range of threats remains extremely wide. 
Monitoring and assessing these threats is a central and key 
task of intelligence. At the present time Russia's interests, 
and primarily its security, are threatened by the appearance of 
"trouble spots" close to its borders. For the first time since 
World War II attempts are being made to revise borders on the 
European continent. The significance of economic and 
environmental security has increased. 
  Needless to say, some of these problems have predominantly 
domestic roots. However, we can also see external factors which 
exacerbate these problems. The task of intelligence is to 
uncover these factors. On a day-to-day basis Russian 
intelligence agents supply information for subsequent 
decisionmaking by the highest organs of power. Primarily 
regarding issues of foreign and defense policy. In addition, 
the intelligence service's remit includes the country's economic 
security, scientific and technical progress, and the 
environment. At home and abroad analytical reports by the FIS 
have been an authoritative voice on major problems affecting 
international security: On the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and NATO plans. We intend to continue the practice 
of preparing these documents. 
  Finally, the intelligence service not only obtains 
information; it also exchanges data with other special services 
on problems of mutual interest. These include information on 
the fight against terrorism, organized crime, and maintenance of 
the nonproliferation regime applying to nuclear and other types 
of weapons of mass destruction. 
  The need for the Russian FIS and its contribution to the 
cause of protecting Russia's national security was underlined by 
Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin when he visited FIS 
headquarters recently. His speech to intelligence operatives 
laid down future guidelines for all of us. 
  [Semenova] Incidentally, since you touched on the issue of 
weapons of mass destruction. Russian and foreign mass media 
have recently carried sensational reports regarding the problem 
of the development of nuclear weapons in our country. In this 
sphere, it seems, all the "laurels" belong to the intelligence 
service, and our scientists merely give enthusiastic assessments 
of the information obtained by intelligence. 
  [Trubnikov] This is nothing more than deliberate or not so 
deliberate repetition of old cock-and-bull stories about the 
Russians "stealing" the atomic bomb from the Americans. It was 
untrue 50 years ago and it remains untrue today. 
  In fact, the development of nuclear weapons in our country 
has been the result primarily of our own scientific efforts and 
our own scientific leading lights such as Kurchatov, Khariton, 
Zeldovich, and many others. The atom bomb is not some simple 
mechanism which it is possible to look over and then copy back 
at home. If our own scientists had not been able to fully grasp 
the secrets of the atomic nucleus, they would simply have been 
unable to understand and assess the information on nuclear 
problems which our intelligence service managed to obtain. 
  Today this is history, and there are frequently 
exaggerations 
in the way history is told: Sometimes silence is assiduously 
cultivated, whereas at other times, on the contrary, too much 
emphasis is placed. The intelligence service does not want 
"other people's laurels," as you put it. It is entirely 
satisfied with its own. And the service which intelligence 
provided in this case was to latch onto an important trend in 
the development of science and technology, a trend which had 
colossal military potential, and to obtain information which 
enabled us to speed up -- let me repeat, speed up -- work on 
developing nuclear weapons in our country. 
  [Semenova] Thank you, I think your explanation dots all the 
i's and crosses all the t's, at the same time precisely 
indicating the intelligence service's role in developing 
science. This is especially topical at the moment. 
  But in the former USSR Russia did not have its own security 
organs, including an intelligence service. Following the Soviet 
Union's disintegration how was the FIS formed -- on the 
"wreckage" of the USSR KGB First Main Directorate or, so to 
speak, from scratch? 
  [Trubnikov] The FIS was not formed on "wreckage" or from 
scratch. Russia received a strong existing intelligence 
service: the First Main Directorate's material and technical and 
organizational base and its cadres. 
  Furthermore, by that time Russia had already started to form 
its own security organs system. In March 1991 the Federal 
Security Agency was set up, which included counterintelligence 
and intelligence subdivisions. Many KGB and First Main 
Directorate staffers were sent to work in the Russian state 
security organs, and many of them now occupy leading posts in 
the FIS. At the end of 1991 the First Main Directorate and 
Russian intelligence subdivisions merged. 
  [Semenova] How does the FIS differ from the First Main 
Directorate in terms of its structure and from other 
intelligence services in terms of its tasks?... Or are the 
general organizational principles the same for all the world's 
intelligence services, like the laws of society's development? 
  [Trubnikov] The main difference is that the intelligence 
service has stopped being the quasi-state and quasi-party organ 
it was within the KGB framework. Hence all the changes: 
departyization, deideologization, organizational and functional 
autonomy, strict observance of the law, control from the 
legislative and executive branches, and such like. 
  Of course, the ending of the Cold War and the emergence of 
new geopolitical realities set us new tasks. Certain new 
subdivisions were formed to tackle them: economic intelligence, 
monitoring the nonproliferation of mass destruction weapons, 
collaboration with foreign special services. On the whole our 
intelligence service has a structure which is typical of all 
modern special services. It is determined by the very nature of 
intelligence and by the nature of its activity, and includes the 
extractive apparatus, analytical subdivisions, and auxiliary 
services. 
  [Semenova] What position does Russian intelligence occupy in 
the world "league table" of special services? 
  [Trubnikov] When we start talking about which intelligence 
services are in the premier world league and what positions they 
occupy in it, then the leaders most frequently mentioned are the 
U.S. CIA, the Israeli Mossad, the British secret service, and 
Russian intelligence. We have always been in this league and I 
would like to believe that we will always remain in it. 
  As regards the specific position, much depends on the 
parameters used to define it: the scale of activity, the size 
of the budget, the number of personnel, the professional 
standard of intelligence officers, their commitment to their 
duty, and how they turn their qualities into specific results. 
  Our people daily prove their loyalty to Russia in their 
deeds. I believe that, if the cadre personnel of our 
"opponents" were put into the same conditions in which Russian 
intelligence now finds itself, few would survive. But ours 
serve and will continue to serve! 
  [Semenova] Initially "civilian" leaders, mainly politicians, 
have also been appointed in other special services. But later 
they all received military ranks and already feel like real 
"military men." The FIS director is a politician and 
academician but has not become a general. Why? 
  [Trubnikov] The FIS director's authority is determined not 
by the number and size of stars on his shoulder boards or the 
lack of same. The main thing here is knowledge, analytical and 
organizational abilities, a commitment to the cause, and 
attention to people's needs. Yevgeniy Maksimovich Primakov has 
all this, and without a military rank. 
  [Semenova] Are there other academicians in the FIS? 
  [Trubnikov] So far none of the FIS cadre staffers has 
received this academic rank. 
  [Semenova] What currently attracts people to an intelligence 
officer's profession? 
  [Trubnikov] Not ultrahigh wages at any rate. Our staffers' 
salaries are not the lowest but, like those of all budget-funded 
employees and servicemen, are considerably lower than in the 
private sector. But roughly the same situation exists in other 
countries. 
  Young people are now coming into intelligence above all 
because this work gives them the opportunity to serve their 
country and to bring it benefit at our difficult time. An 
intelligence officer's profession allows a person to show 
himself as an individual, to realize his working, volitional, 
and moral qualities -- sometimes in extreme situations -- and to 
become a top-class expert. Our specialists in the fields of 
politics, economics, military matters, and science and 
technology are constantly abreast of the latest world events and 
achievements in the spheres of their activity. 
  People now want to come into intelligence not because it is 
"advantageous" but because it is important and interesting. 
  [Semenova] Spy -- is that offensive? Has the attitude 
toward intelligence changed, do people not continue to confuse 
it with a political police? 
  [Trubnikov] We are dealing with cadre intelligence officers 
or agents. It is our Federal Counterintelligence Service which 
mainly deals with spies, because a spy is considered to be 
someone who works against our country, whereas we work for 
Russia. 
  We do not engage in political investigation. In my opinion 
this is clear to an unbiased compatriot. 
  [Semenova] If you started all over again would you become an 
intelligence officer? 
  [Trubnikov] Of course!

  [Text] Certain politicians link the creation of the new 
political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, with the 
forthcoming campaign for the presidential elections. But, 
according to its leader, Yegor Gaydar, the purpose of the new 
party's program is to make sensible changes to life in Russia. 
  [Begin Gaydar recording] I founded this party to promote a 
worthy future for Russia, to prevent dangerous, totalitarian 
experiments, to prevent our country being drawn once more into a 
debilitating arms race or military adventures. Russia's 
Democratic Choice regards itself as the successor to the 
democratic movement -- one which strives to get rid of the many 
weaknesses in this movement, its lack of cohesion and 
organization, the endless internal arguments, instead of serious 
propaganda work and constant, convincing explanation of the 
truth about what is taking place in Russia to our electorate. 
  This is a party which strives to draw support from the 
calmest, worthiest and most sensible section of the Russian 
public, from those who are prepared to listen to sensible 
arguments, from those who are endowed with commonsense, from 
those who realize that our country will not get any stronger or 
become rich as a result of large-scale military expenditure, 
that serious military reform is acutely needed in our country, 
that armed forces' manpower needs to be cut, that conscription 
needs to be reduced -- while ensuring that the army has better 
equipment and supplies, that its weapons are modernized, that it 
is turned into a really combat-ready, mobile force. 
  It is the party of those who are convinced that pointless, 
large-scale subvention of inefficient enterprises will only 
perpetuate their backwardness, that such subsidies are only 
needed by those who would like to hold on to their directors' 
chairs. It is the party of those who believe that we need 
serious agrarian reform, without which our rural economy will 
never be efficient, that such reform is possible and essential. 
  It is the party of those who do not want imperialist 
adventures, who do not see Russia's greatness in the 
establishment of empire but in its citizens' well-being, of 
those who believe that our strength resides not so much in force 
of arms but in the great potential of our people, of those who 
agree with our policy priorities -- freedom, property and the 
law. 
  We very much hope that we will be able to have, as allies, 
the intelligentsia, entrepreneurs, skilled workers and that 
section of the peasantry which really wishes to work 
independently on the land -- all those who are capable of using 
their own hands to make their life richer, securer and calmer, 
who want to do this. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Vs.O. under the "Meanwhile" rubric: "Such </F>
Prospects Are Costly"] 
  [Text] "Russia's Choice," the most capital-intensive 
political association in the last elections, is continuing to 
organize itself. As was only to be expected, businessmen are 
flocking to the banners of radical economist Yegor Gaydar. They 
are not taking up rank-and-file posts under these banners 
either. For example, the Executive Committee of "Russia's 
Democratic Choice" was recently headed by Oleg Boyko, leader of 
the renowned "OLBI" Concern and of the less renowned 
"Natsionalnyy Kredit" Bank. 
  "OLBI" is known as a major trading house and as an open-type 
joint-stock company. Naturally, even the largest trading house 
is hardly capable of funding a national political movement. In 
other words, a direct financial interest in Boyko on Gaydar's 
part is unlikely. On the other hand, in the last elections 
"OLBI" actively supported "Russia's Choice," so that Mr. Boyko's 
new post may be regarded as political compensation of a kind. 
But there is also a third aspect, the most interesting one. 
  The point is that Mr. Boyko, "OLBI," and the "Natsionalnyy 
Kredit" Bank have strong ties (including partnership ties) with 
the "Vzlet" Science and Production Association, one of the 
flagships of the Russian defense industry. The interest of the 
military-industrial complex in Gaydar -- the leader of the 
largest Duma faction, which voted for broader budget spending on 
defense, and someone with access to the president -- is obvious. 
In addition, Gaydar must also be of interest to the defense 
industry as a radical market economist. They can complain as 
much as they like about the collapse of the defense complex as a 
consequence of the reforms. But only Gaydar's reforms can 
enable the leaders of large defense enterprises to participate 
seriously in privatization.

  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, will file another suit to protect 
his honor and dignity against the leader of Russia's Democratic 
Choice, Yegor Gaydar, and the board of editors of the daily 
newspaper Izvestiya. 
  This statement was made by Zhirinovskiy's lawyer, Sergey 
Belyak, in an interview with Interfax Wednesday. Gaydar's 
article "A Bet on Scoundrels" published by Izvestiya on May 17 
served as the reason for the suit. Belyak referred to Gaydar's 
phrase from the article: "Zhirinovskiy is the most popular 
fascist leader in Russia" and descriptions like "fascist 
populist." 
  On June 7, Zhirinovskiy signed a statement to withdraw his 
first suit against Gaydar made on December 7. According to 
Belyak, Zhirinovskiy made this step after the signing of the 
Social Accord Pact, wishing to show his readiness for 
compromises not only in words, but also in practice. At the 
same time, Gaydar's new insulting statements have forced 
Zhirinovskiy to file another suit against him, Belyak said. 
  "I have deep doubts that Gaydar understands anything in the 
history of fascism and Zhirinovskiy's works if he has ever read 
them," Belyak said. He explained Gaydar's actions by "the 
desire of an unpopular politician to curse a popular leader." 
  Zhirinovskiy evaluated the moral damage inflicted on him by 
Gaydar at 500,000 rubles.

  [Text] Moscow's law and order organs gave the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] a remarkable gift for 
Russian Independence Day. 
  The Investigations Directorate of the Moscow Main Internal 
Affairs Administration has turned down a request to start 
criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy from State Duma 
deputies and a STOLITSA magazine journalist who were injured by 
V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] on 8 April (owing to 
the absence of corpus delicti). Thus, the LDPR leader gets 
carte blanche to use the physiognomies of his political 
opponents to relieve the itch in his fists. According to 
KURANTY, however, the State Duma deputies do not intend to give 
up attempts to get Zhirinovskiy punished, even if not by court, 
for the fight in the Duma in April.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS--The acting prosecutor general 
Alexey Ilyushenko has lodged an appeal with the State Duma, 
asking to deprive the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of his parliamentary immunity. 
  The request was made in connection with the fact that the 
Russian prosecutor's general office believes that Zhirinovskiy's 
book entitled "The Last Breakthrough to the South" gives grounds 
for instituting criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy. This 
was announced by the chairman of the State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, at 
its session today. 
  The Duma Council is expected to look into the appeal on 
Thursday.

  [Excerpt] [Correspondent Ernest Matskyavichus] [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia leader, LDPR] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
today said that the construction of Yeltsin's edict on fighting 
organized crime was good on paper, but in reality lifeless. The 
presidential program for fighting crime will be effective only 
in conjunction with measures proposed by the Liberal Democratic 
Party. 
  Apart from that, the LDPR leader expressed his opinion on 
the 
motives of Acting Procurator General Aleksey Ilyushenko, who has 
lodged an appeal with the Duma on stripping Zhirinovskiy of his 
parliamentary immunity and instituting criminal proceedings 
against him. 
  [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I view this as a political 
provocation. He is undermining the agreement on accord. He did 
not agree this issue with the country's president. I am the 
leader of the party that won the elections and head a deputies' 
faction in the State Duma. This is a special situation. 
Therefore this is his mistake and I think that after this he 
will lose his post as acting Russian procurator general. This 
will be our contribution -- quickly filling this post with a 
worthy lawyer from our country. [end recording] 
  [Matskyavichus] Tomorrow the Duma council is to examine the 
appeal from Acting Procurator General Ilyushenko.

  [Text] The legislating creativity of the Russian president 
who has recently signed two packages of economic decrees is 
explained by the fact that the Russian government lacks the 
necessary powers and was acting quite slowly over the recent 
months. 
  This statement was made by Deputy Economics Minister Sergey 
Vasiliyev at a news conference in Moscow Wednesday. He 
categorically dismissed "speculations of various kinds" about 
"an alleged dual power in the management of the economy, that of 
the government and the presidential staff." 
  Vasiliyev pointed out that the first package had been 
prepared solely by government experts, while "only one 
representative of the presidential team attended to the 
development of the other one." 
  As another reason for Boris Yeltsin's interference into 
economics, Vasiliyev indicated the fact that the State Duma 
"could not bake laws like cakes" as there is a procedure for 
their adoption.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Latest Set of Economic </F>
Edicts Signed"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has signed the latest set of economic 
edicts. Three of them are devoted to problems of housing 
construction. In addition, he has also signed the edicts "On 
Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest Advertizing," "On 
Improving the Work of the Russian Federation Banking System," 
"On Some Measures to Encourage Investment Activity, Including by 
Attracting Foreign Credits," and "On Some Measures to Ensure 
State Management of the Economy." 
  Yeltsin's lawmaking activity is due to two factors, in the 
opinion of observers. First, the president is concerned at the 
slow progress of the reforms. Second, he has been forced to 
take some steps to compensate for the Duma's inactivity. 
  Whereas the first set of edicts, signed at the end of May, 
was prepared exclusively by government experts, the latter 
documents are the work of government economists collaborating 
with their colleagues from the president's team. All the 
documents have been presented for signature on the government's 
behalf. 
  In the opinion of Deputy Economy Minister Sergey Vasilyev, 
one of the authors of the edicts, the package of housing edicts 
occupies a special place. These are norm-setting documents, 
which prescribe incentives for the process of housing 
construction. They deal with the rules for the sale of 
unfinished apartment blocks and the provision of incentives for 
the creation of savings for housing. And in particular on the 
enshrinement of housing certificates in law. 
  During the preparation of the documents it was the edict on 
improving the banking system which sparked off the stormiest 
debates. This edict, in fact, stipulates the extent to which 
foreign banks are allowed to penetrate the Russian market. 
Russian commercial banks showed tremendous interest in this 
document. As IZVESTIYA has learned, the text of the edict was 
reworked after the president's press conference, where he firmly 
advocated that foreign banks be allowed access to the Russian 
market. 
  The edict "On Protecting Consumers' Interests From Dishonest 
Advertising" can begin working effectively as soon as a number 
of amendments have been made to the existing legislation. These 
amendments will regulate the work of the mass media and the 
advertisers. Meanwhile, this edict already makes it possible to 
apply fairly tough sanctions to advertisers themselves, even to 
the point of withholding their license. 
  In addition, restrictions are being placed on the ability of 
unlicensed organizations to attract funds from the population. 
At the moment only banks, insurance companies, and pension 
funds, on the one hand, and joint-stock companies, on the other, 
are allowed to do that. Their activity is regulated in the 
following way: There are restrictions on the ratio of outside 
resources and firms' own resources and there is also a 
prescription that a balance and the main technical-economic 
parameters must be published in the press. Before trying to 
persuade the population to subscribe money to a loan, 
joint-stock companies will have to declare their anticipated 
profit. 
  The edict "On Some Measures to Ensure State Management of 
the 
Economy" ought to have been adopted long ago. Essentially, the 
edict is designed to put an end to the absurd situation at 
present in which a director can dispose of an enterprise 
entirely as though it were his property but without bearing the 
slightest responsibility to the actual owner, the state, which 
can neither dismiss nor punish a negligent manager. 
  Mutual relations between the state and the director will 
henceforth be regulated not by labor law but by civil law. A 
contract will be concluded with a director for the right to 
manage an enterprise, the form of which is stipulated by the 
edict. The contract may be cancelled if the accords are not 
observed.

empowered by it;

  --social guarantees for the enterprise leader and members of 
his family, including in the event of the death of the

  --rights and duties of the enterprise leader in connection 
with the management of the enterprise, including the right to 
hire and fire enterprise personnel, delegate authority, and 
manage enterprise property; 
  --enterprise leader reporting procedure;

  --enterprise leader's liability for breach of contract, 
economic results of enterprise activity, and safekeeping and 
specific use of property, including material liability for 
damage caused to the enterprise as a result of the enterprise 
leader's actions or inaction. 
  3. It is to be laid down that representatives of the state 
in management organs of joint-stock companies (associations or 
other mixed-ownership forms of enterprise), whose holding 
(stock, share) is federally owned (hereinafter, companies), will 
perform their activities in the management organs of the 
aforesaid companies in accordance with the present edict and 
decisions of the Russian Federation Government and also of 
federal organs of executive authority or the Russian Federal 
Property Fund, on whose behalf they are acting in accordance 
with Russian Federation legislation. 
  4. The following can be appointed to represent the state in 
companies' management organs: 
  --state employees -- on the basis of decisions by the 
Russian 
Federation president, Russian Federation Government, the 
relevant federal organs of executive authority, or the Russian 
Federal Property Fund; 
  --other citizens of the Russian Federation (except those 
elected to representative organs of state authority or local 
self-government) -- on the basis of contracts to represent the 
interests of the state concluded in accordance with civil 
legislation. 
  Contracts with Russian Federation citizens to represent 
state 
interests will be concluded by the Russian Federation State 
Committee for the Management of State Property, the Russian 
Federal Property Fund, or their territorial organs and must 
incorporate: 
  --the term of the contract and the procedure for its early 
cancelation; 
  --the amount of recompense to be received by the 
representative of the state;

the contract to represent state interests. 
  Contracts to represent state interests in management organs 
of joint-stock companies (associations and other mixed-ownership 
forms of enterprise, whose holding (stock, share) is federally 
owned, are to be registered at justice organs. 
  5. State representatives in companies' management organs are 
obliged to agree in writing with federal organs of executive 
authority or the Russian Federal Property Fund on whose behalf 
they are acting: 
  --draft decisions of companies' management organs, which 
they 
will be submitting and supporting; 
  --their future vote on draft decisions proposed by other 
members of companies' management organs. 
  6. Draft decisions and voting on draft decisions on the 
following questions will be agreed in accordance with the

state representatives to consult on draft decisions and on 
voting on draft decisions on other matters which fall within the 
terms of reference of the corresponding company management 
organs, but which are not provided for in the present edict. 
  If there are several state representatives in a particular 
management organ, delegated by different federal organs of 
executive authority and the Russian Federal Property Fund, the 
common stance of these representatives will be determined 
beforehand, in accordance with the procedure laid down by the 
Russian Federation Government. 
  7. Any breach by state employees appointed as state 
representatives in company management organs of the established 
procedure for agreeing draft decisions and votes on draft 
decisions, and also votes that do not accord with the results of 
consultations or decisions by the Russian Federation Government 
and the relevant federal organs of executive authority will 
result in disciplinary action, even dismissal from state service. 
  Similar breaches committed by state representatives in 
company management organs who are not state employees will 
result in action envisaged by the contract to represent the 
state's interests. 
  State representatives in company management organs will also

Government. 
  9. It is to be laid down that in cases where all owners of 
enterprises conclude contracts with their leaders in accordance

the components of the Russian Federation apply the rules of the 
present edict when concluding contracts with leaders of state 
enterprises that are state-owned by the corresponding components

federal state enterprises operating on the basis of contracts

<F P=106> [Russian Federation President's edict "On Housing Credits" </F>
preceded by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA comment under general heading: 
"We Shall Construct a House and Live There"] 
  [Text] For the absolute majority of Russian the housing 
problem has always existed. In recent years the situation has 
deteriorated markedly. The state is no longer able to afford 
free housing for those on the waiting list. When it is a case 
of the cost of the housing going on sale, people blench. 
  The so-called middle class has found itself in the worst 
position. Those with special entitlements have hopes, albeit 
slender ones, of obtaining free municipal housing. The middle 
classes are now being asked to buy apartments. Here the bank 
credit interest rates are such that they protect the banks 
themselves against inflation. 
  The edicts of Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin signed 
on the eve of Independence Day finally create the necessary 
normative base for the legal activity of commercial structures 
which have been engaging "illicitly" in the issue of bonds 
guaranteeing that their owners will acquire housing in the 
foreseeable future. Conditions are being created for investments 
in the housing sphere and the foundation has also been laid for 
the development of a system of targeted credits, including 
mortgage loans. Finally, measures are being suggested for 
reviving the construction of the apartment blocks and 
residential regions "frozen" throughout the country. 
<H5>  Russian Federation President's Edict no. 1180 on Housing </H5>
Credits 
  With a view to rendering assistance to citizens in 
constructing (reconstructing) and acquiring housing I decree: 
  1. That it be established that: 
  Russian Federation citizens who according to the updated 
procedure have been deemed in need of improvement to their 
housing conditions shall receive free subsidies for the 
construction or acquisition of housing in accordance with the 
Russian Federation Government's 10 December 1993 decree no. 1278 
"On the Approval of the Statute on Granting Russian Federation 
Citizens in Need of an Improvement to Their Housing Conditions 
Free Subsidies for the Construction or Acquisition of Housing;" 
  Corporate bodies and citizens of the Russian Federation 
shall 
receive loans to construct (modernize) and acquire housing and 
also to develop land plots for housing construction on a

construction. 
  5. That it be recommended to enterprises and organizations 
of various forms of ownership that within the procedure for 
rendering assistance to their workers in improving housing 
conditions they give banks guarantees that they will extinguish 
the credits received by the enterprises' workers for the

<F P=106> [Report by A. Yevgenyev: "Different Poles of Reform"] </F>
  [Text] To judge by operational information from the State 
Committee for Statistics May has been a record month in terms of 
the decline in industrial production. In terms of physical 
volume it declined 6.5 percent compared with April and 28 
percent compared with May last year. As a whole over the first 
five months of this year 25.9 percent less output was produced 
than for the same period last year. 
  Of course a part was played by the fact that there was less 
working time in May than in April ("we were taking time off and 
enjoying ourselves"). Nonetheless we cannot fail to draw 
attention to the increasing stoppages of enterprises, mainly, as 
the State Committee for Statistics notes, because of the 
impossibility of selling their output. 
  The volume of production declined most in the sectors of the 
investment complex and nonfood consumer goods. Thus, while the 
fuel and energy complex showed a decline of 12 percent and the 
food industry a decline of 22 percent, the pulp and paper 
industry's production declined 32-34 percent, the chemical and 
petrochemical industry declined 35 percent, light industry 41 
percent, and machine building 45 percent. 
  Of 406 of the most important types of output taken into 
account in operational returns, the production of 20 articles 
increased compared with January through May last year while the 
production of 381 declined. 
  Capital construction continues to be reduced. Over the five 
months 25-30 percent fewer investments were channeled into the 
republic's economy and 40 percent fewer were channeled into the 
production sphere than a year ago. The commissioning of housing 
has declined 6 percent. 
  As for agriculture, as of 30 May agricultural enterprises 
had 
sown 50.6 million hectares to spring crops as against 53.2 
million last year. It is true that spring grain crops have been 
sown on 34 million hectares, which is 2 percent more than a year 
ago. A motley picture characterizes livestock raising. As a 
whole the production of meat and milk has declined 8-10 percent. 
But on private farms it has actually increased while at 
agricultural enterprises it has declined 15-16 percent. 
  In foreign trade exports rose 9 percent and imports declined 
28 percent, which ensures Russia a reliable positive balance. 
But little is changing in the structure of exports. Gas (20 
percent), crude oil (19.5 percent), petroleum products (7 
percent), and ferrous metals (10 percent) continue to 
predominate in it while machinery and equipment account for a 
miserly share (33 percent). Essentially it is the trade balance 
of a developing country. But we must realize that substantial 
changes here are possible only as a result of profound 
transformations in the entire economy. 
  In recent months inflation has been markedly checked. 
Compared with December 1993 consumer prices have increased just 
72 percent. Average wages have increased 5 percent compared with 
april (prices have increased 7 percent) totalling 180,000 rubles 
[R]. The highest wages are for workers in the fuel industry 
(R420,000), electricity (R381,000), and the credit and insurance 
sphere (R366,000). Real disposable monetary incomes (incomes 
left after counting essential payments corrected against the 
consumer prices index) increased 11 percent over the past year.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The state of affairs in Russia's economy is normal 
and whatever kind of market has been formed, the state's 
intervention in market relations has been minimal. This was 
stated today at a news conference by the heads of the 
government's Economic Reform Center. According to them, 
inflation over the last couple of months has remained at a low 
level -- 8 percent. However, there are certain trends toward it 
increasing. The ruble has been losing its value at a slower 
rate than prices have been rising, and the average wage has 
moved closer -- calculated in foreign currency -- to $100. 
  Meanwhile, according to the Economic Reform Center, there 
remains a considerable fall in output in the machine-building 
and fuel and power complex. The failure of enterprises to make 
payments are not too good, either. Their debts on wages remain 
high. However, according to Richard Yard, an economist from 
Britain, this type of nonpayment was reduced by 4 percent 
compared with April. Moreover, according to Yard, the overdue 
debts of enterprises are lower than the European average. The 
London economist noted that in the sphere of employment among 
the Russian population, as nowhere else in the world, the 
redistribution of the working people in production outstrips 
open unemployment. And the latter in our country increased by 
only 1 percent during the past 18 months. 
  The most comforting news was given by Sergey Pavlenko, a 
spokesman for the Economic Reform Center. Among the population, 
faith in financial institutions has increased. The citizens' 
savings are growing not in hard currency, but in rubles.

  [Text] The validity of vouchers will not be prolonged after 
June 30 and President Yeltsin may sign a decree on post-voucher 
privatization soon, Vice-Premier, Chairman of the RF State 
Property Committee Anatoliy Chubays said. 
  Interviewed by the Financial Information Agency on 
Wednesday, 
Chubays said that the program for post-voucher privatization 
approved by the government was to be submitted to President 
Yeltsin for signature no later than June 25. 
  Chubays said that the bulk of funds (51 percent) raised by 
the post-voucher privatization beginning on July 1 would be left 
to the enterprises. 
  About the mechanism of post-voucher privatization 
Vice-Premier said that simultaneously with the presidential 
decree effecting it the program would be presented to the State 
Duma for consideration. 
  Chubays said that discounts to staffs were one of the key 
features of monetary privatization. 
  Two types of discounts are planned. Under one option the 
employees will receive no more than 25 percent of privileged 
shares giving no right to vote free. Under the other the 
employees will be able to buy out 10 percent of simple (voting) 
actions at a 30 percent discount. The starting price of shares 
is expected to grow 600 to 700 percent, because the assets will 
be evaluated in January 1, 1994 prices.

  [Text] First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin has 
described Russia's military expenditure for 1994 as totally 
unacceptable and absurd. Kokoshin took part in a nationwide 
conference on the development of avionics in St. Petersburg 
Wednesday. 
  Kokoshin told Interfax that the budget proposed by the State 
Duma would not only fail to lead the defense industries out of 
the standstill, but would completely ruin them. 
  Pointing out that Russia could still trade arms, including 
warships, Kokoshin said that the problem was to find a buyer 
rather than to sell the equipment at a profit. 
  During his stay in St. Petersburg, Kokoshin visited the 
holding company Leninets, developing military electronic 
products, and the dock Severnye Verfi to see the construction of 
several warships. 
  Kokoshin is leaving for Minsk to meet Belarusian Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich on June 16.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun--Another artificial Earth satellite, 
Foton, designed for continued study of the properties of 
materials in space, was launched on 14 June 1994 from the 
Plesetsk cosmodrome by means of a Soyuz booster rocket. 
  Its 18-day flight program envisages experiments on the 
production of semiconductors, optical glass with a variable 
refractive index, and biologically active substances in 
microgravitation, as well as the development of technologies for 
their experimental industrial production. 
  In accordance with a commercial agreement, a Biopan 
container 
with equipment designed by German specialists has been placed on 
board the Foton satellite. 
  The satellite has been placed in orbit with the following 
parameters: 
  --initial period of revolution--90.4 mins; 
  --apogee--385 km; 
  --perigee--229 km; 
  --orbital inclination 62.8 degrees. 
  The apparatus on board the satellite is working normally.

  [Text] By the year 2010 the share of electricity generated 
at nuclear power stations in Russia will grow to 30 or 35 
percent compared to 14 percent last year. These figures were 
disclosed at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the Deputy 
Minister of Nuclear Energy Lev Ryabev. 
  According to the official, nuclear power engineering is 
going 
to expand as the production of oil and coal is going to decline; 
experts predict that only gas extraction is going to grow: from 
620 billion cubic meters now to 780 billion in 2010. 
  Between 2001 and 2009 Russia will shut down all nuclear 
power 
plants of the first generation. All of them were designed 
before 1973 and do not meet modern safety norms. Such 
generators are located at the Leningrad, Kursk, Novovoronezh and 
Kola stations. 
  Ryabev said that power units of the third generation are now 
being developed and are equipped with safety systems which do 
not rely on human actions. The first power station of the third 
generation should be built in 2000 or 2002. 
  The ministry is also working on reactors of the fourth 
generation which according to Ryabev will be based on principles 
of "natural safety." These plants would be designed so that no 
escape of radiation is possible under any condition, the 
minister said. 
  Russia is determined to develop a closed production circuit 
in nuclear power engineering: Usable uranium will be extracted 
from used fuel and most of the highly active wastes burned in 
fast reactors. 
  Ryabev stressed that Russia has enough nuclear fuel to last 
till the year 2020 and the uranium ore extracted in the Chita 
Region is being exported. He said the ministry is open to the 
question of changing forms of ownership. "So far nuclear 
facilities are government property, but we are not ruling out 
the possibility that they can be turned into joint-stock 
companies or sold to private owners," Ryabev said.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Maryukha under the "Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "From a `Little Fleet' to a `Little 
Creek' in Russia. Such Are the Various Wishes Expressed by 
Ukrainian Politicians 'Milking' the Dividing up of the Black Sea 
Fleet for Everything They Can Get out of It"] 
  [Text] According to an RIA report, Ivan Plyushch, 
contender for the office of Ukrainian president, has voiced a 
desire to "add" to Ukraine a "little creek" to Ukraine 
"somewhere in Kaliningrad Oblast or the Far East," through 
dividing up all the fleets of the former Union. Contrary to all 
agreements reached earlier, in the home straight of this 
election campaign Plyushch is again using the "zero option" of 
dividing up the Black Sea Fleet to put the cat among the 
pigeons: He is saying that everything stationed in Ukraine is 
Ukrainian, and this represents a new spiral of confrontation 
between Russia and Ukraine! 
  President Leonid Kravchuk is being more consistent in his 
plans. Speaking on Ukrainian radio, he announced his intention 
after resolving the Black Sea Fleet problem to sign a 
wide-ranging agreement between Russia and Ukraine which, in his 
opinion, "will put Ukrainian-Russian relations on a 
qualitatively new footing." Nevertheless, this and the definite 
progress which has been achieved in Kiev at talks to divide up 
the fleet have not prevented the Ukrainian leader from sending 
his defense minister, Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, on a 
"mission" to the United States, where one of the issues under 
discussion will be consultations on the problems of the Black 
Sea Fleet. 
  Meanwhile, the situation in the fleet itself is not changing 
for the better. Yesterday at about 0500 hours at one of the 
units of the Black Sea Fleet's shore-based forces near 
Simferopol there was an armed attack on a sentry guarding a 
military storage facility. The sentry sustained a flesh wound to 
the chest from a small caliber weapon. His life is not in 
danger, and an investigation is under way. 
  But it is the mythical withdrawal of materiel rather than 
the 
threat to the sailor's life which alarms the Ukrainian military. 
The Ukrainian Naval Forces Military Council is protesting about 
the alleged withdrawal of fleet materiel from the Crimean Naval 
Base, the Ochakov Division, and other places. The thought 
occures that we have not yet had time to forget how similar 
"protests" in Odessa ended up -- beginning with an attempt to 
detain the Cheleken, Ukrainian special purpose troops used force 
to "nationalize" a whole division of Black Sea Fleet ships.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The introduction of 
any sanctions at all against Pyongyang and the holding of an 
international conference on the problem of the Korean 
peninsula's nuclear-free status are incompatible. This point of 
view was expressed today by DPRK Ambassador to Moscow Son 
Song-pil. 
  Replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, he said: 
"At one time we displayed an interest in the Russian proposal to 
hold an international conference. Our side based its position 
on the fact that such a forum would promote a solution to the 
accumulated problems around the negotiating table on the basis 
of equal rights and mutual respect. There was no question of 
any sanctions at that time. Now we clearly state: Sanctions and 
dialogue are incompatible." 
  Regarding the DPRK's departure from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), the ambassador announced that on 13 June 
his government officially informed the U.S. Administration of 
this, the latter being the depository state of the IAEA Charter. 
He stressed that recently all the cooperation with the IAEA 
boiled down to carrying out inspections of North Korean 
facilities which were of a "far from objective nature". The 
IAEA has practically neither the time nor the inclination for 
constructive cooperation in the development of the DPRK's 
peaceful nuclear program as envisioned by the charter of that 
organization, the diplomat said, . 
  "The longer we stayed in the IAEA the more vigorously our 
peaceful nuclear activity was being restricted," Son Song-pil 
stated. He considers that the resolution recently adopted at 
the Council of Administrators of the IAEA on the "North Korean 
nuclear problem" effectively signifies the introduction of 
sanctions. This, in his opinion, is what forced the DPRK 
Government to make the decision to leave the international 
agency. 
  As for the Treaty of Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 
the 
ambassador said the DPRK reserved the right to so-called 
"special status". This is because his country announced its 
departure from the treaty but then declared its "temporary 
suspension."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- Minister of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation Andrey Kozyrev today levelled criticism at 
the Security Council draft resolution released by the American 
delegation to the United Nations, on a settlement of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. In his words, the draft 
resolution contravenes the accords reached in the course of the 
conversations beteen the presidents of Russia and the United 
States. 
  One can only express perplexity at the fact, he said, that 
"the American diplomats have released in New York a draft 
resolution containing a list of specific sanctions." Andrey 
Kozyrev said this was done by the American side despite the fact 
that during the telephone conversation between Presidents Boris 
Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, and then during the Russian Federation 
foreign minister's telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher "it was agreed absolutely clearly to 
act jointly, to work out a draft resolution jointly and not to 
put forward unilateral unitiatives." 
  "The release of such a draft resolution unilaterally will 
cause us serious difficulty in examining this document," A. 
Kozyrev stated. "We will not in any event support the range of 
sanctions which is being put forward without previous agreement 
with us." 
  For its part, Moscow, as indeed the heads of the two states 
agreed, A. Kozyrev announced, conveyed confidentially to the 
American side its own proposals on a draft resolution. They 
include both the idea of sanctions and specific ideas on an 
international conference on questions of security and the 
nuclear-free status of the Korean peninsula. In keeping with 
the accords of the presidents and of the heads of the foreign 
policy deparltments of the Russian Federation and the United 
States, in the resolution both these elements should be 
contained on an equal footing. 
  Expressing the opinion that "the work will be continued," A. 
Kozyrev at the same time stressed that "the unilateral actions 
of the American diplomats in New York only complicate the 
matter."

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today 
that North Korea must respect the treaty on non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 
  He said in an interview that he had information proving that 
North Korea had prepared a statement on withdrawal from 
International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the secretariat of 
the agency has as yet received no similar official statement. 
  Kozyrev underlined that if North Korea violated the Non- 
Proliferation Treaty, there would be no other way out but to 
impose sanctions. Kozyrev pointed out that the sanctions must 
be imposed gradually and be considered a last resort. 
  Kozyrev spoke in favor of an international conference 
initiated by Russia so that China, Japan, Korea, Russia, the 
U.S.A., France, Britain and other members of the UN Security 
Council could make the issue clear for themselves since North 
Korea had put forward a number of explanations of its position. 
  Kozyrev emphasized that North Korea must continue to 
participate in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and observe the 
conditions put forward by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Belyy: "Amur Oblast Has Every </F>
Opportunity to Stop Being Subsidized"] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin's working trip to Amur Oblast continued 15 June. In 
Blagoveshchensk he visited a shipbuilding plant where seiners 
for Far East fishermen are assembled and difficult orders 
connected with the defense industry are carried out. The 
president met with workers in the workshops and expressed 
interest in the course of economic reform at the major 
enterprise involved in conversion. Boris Yeltsin also visited 
one of the leading enterprises in the Amur region -- the 
multi-sector "Partizan" joint stock company. This enterprise 
alone produces more soybeans, for example, than the whole of the 
neighboring Khabarovsk Kray. 
  A detailed conversation about the fuller use of the Amur 
region's potential took place at the oblast administration. 
There the president briefly shared his impressions from 
meetings with Amur inhabitants and stressed that the people's 
mood struck him favorably: They are not hiding the 
difficulties, but, he noted, they are not panicking. Boris 
Yeltsin spoke critically about local trade, noting the small 
range of output in the stores. It was noted at the conference 
that a beginning has been made on the formation of a market 
infrastructure in Amur Oblast. 
  However, parasitical attitudes and contempt for the laws of 
a 
market economy at the primary level, in the enterprises, is one 
reason for the economic crisis and the fall in the volume of 
production. 
  Apart from the crisis factors common to the whole country, 
there are also purely regional factors. The cost of output is 
high because of transportation expenditure and the disparity 
between the price of industrial and agricultural output, as a 
result of which 100,000 tonnes of soybeans, produced last year, 
are left unclaimed in storehouses. The biggest problem of all 
is the lack of a base for processing agricultural raw materials. 
To overcome it, Amur Oblast needs to construct a major plant 
for processing soybeans; after all, the Amur region provides 
something in the order of 70 percent of Russia's soybeans. 
Right away, turning to A. Shokhin, the president gave the 
government instructions to work on this question and provide the 
necessary federal assistance. Similar instructions were given 
to develop a free trade and economic zone in the Blagoveshchensk 
area. 
  The task was set of bringing the oblast's mineral and raw 
material resources more quickly and fully into economic 
circulation; their overall value is assessed at $360 billion. 
There is a possibility of increasing the volume of gold 
extraction by a factor of 1.4-1.7 in the next five years. The 
overwhelming proportion of known reserves and predicted 
resources are concentrated in developed areas, so that growth 
can be achieved without using up big allocations. 
  In the evening of 15 June B. Yeltsin left Blagoveshchensk 
for 
Kyzyl.

  [Text] Tuva, 15 Jun -- The Russian president today arrived 
in Kyzyl, the capita of Tuva, from Blagoveshchensk, and has 
called for Russia's economic and social problems to be solved by 
the combined efforts of the center and the regions. 
  Before meeting Boris Yeltsin, Kaadyr-ool Bichelday, chairman 
of the Tuva Republic's parliament, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that the local authorities and population expect 
understanding of the region's special character to be shown 
during the visit. The leaders are counting on the president 
helping to solve the republic's transport problems. "If life in 
Tuva used to be dependent on vehicle wheels, then that has now 
changed to steamship propellers, since the use of wheels would 
mean doubling the costs of cargo transportation," Kaadyr-ool 
Bicheldey said. 
  Bicheldey sees Yeltsin's visit to the republic as a 
continuation of the policy of passing control over both the 
economy and politics from the state to the regions. Here, the 
parliamentary chairman described the existing contradictions 
between the constitutions of Russia and Tuva as "a matter to be 
agreed upon."

  [Text] Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb 
has received an official governmental delegation from the 
Republic of Cuba, led by Council of Ministers Vice President 
Lionel Soto Prieto. In the course of talks, Myacheslaw Hryb 
pointed out that Belarus is interested in consolidating and 
expanding economic cooperation with Cuba, which, unfortunately, 
is currently developing at quite a sluggish pace. The speaker 
believes problems of mutual payments are among the causes for 
that situation. According to him, however, this problem can 
also be resolved, given that not only Belarus has great interest 
in Cuban products but Cuba is also interested in Belarusian 
goods. The two sides agreed that in the near future it will be 
necessary to organize the work of experts who will draft 
economic agreements for 1995. In the course of the visit, the 
members of the Cuban delegation also held talks with 
representatives of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of 
External Economic Relations.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Ardayev: "Nazarbayev Proposes </F>
Amendments" ] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan has sent the Republic's Supreme Council 
a message entitled: "On the acceleration of market 
transformations and measures to escape from the economic crisis." 
  According to his assessment, the situation in Kazakhstan is 
characterized mainly by negative processes and unstable 
phenomena: "The crisis and its extreme manifestations in the 
form of the slump and rising inflation are nullifying many of 
our efforts to stabilize the economy and are a heavy burden on 
citizens' shoulders." 
  The speech and the president's message outline the main 
areas 
of what N. Nazarbayev sees as the best option for Kazakhstan's 
development. Center stage goes to a money-credit and banking 
reform "which takes real and not formal account of the sovereign 
state's demands on the market economy" in which the key task is 
to halt galloping inflation and strengthen the national 
currency. The president believes that Kazakhstan has only one 
path to financial stabilization -- the reduction of all state 
spending apart from the most essential: appropriations for the 
payment of wages, pensions, and social security grants. 
According to this program all subsidies to enterprises, both 
direct and hidden, are to be terminated with the result that 
loss-makers will face bankruptcy but the state will not bear any 
responsibility for that. It is necessary to cut spending on the 
upkeep of state agencies. In addition, prices for all types of 
goods and services are to be decontroled. 
  The head of state dwelt in particular on the problem of 
stability in Kazakhstan. He dealt in greatest detail with the 
sensitive question of migration, noting that he is enraged both 
by the "attempts to overdo it" and the "desire to embellish 
reality a little and pretend that there is nothing special 
happening." Population loss due to migration has been 
characteristic of Kazakhstan for a quarter of a century now but 
in recent years has increased more than tenfold, reaching 
222,100 people last year. 
  N. Nazarbayev cited factors which, in his view, have been 
encouraging non-Kazakhs to leave Kazakhstan and said that the 
prime reason was mistakes in language policy and the definition 
of the status of the state language. N. Nazarbayev asserted 
that "it is necessary immediately to adopt a new law on 
languages and remove all discrimination against the Russian 
language, which is just as necessary to the development of the 
Kazakhs and other peoples as it is to Russian-speaking 
population itself." A negative role, to use the president's 
phrase, was also played by the "distortion in cadre policy" and 
the "imbalance in the admission of school-leavers to higher and 
secondary specialized educational institutions." In addition, 
N. Nazarbayev believes that the time has come to draw attention 
to manifestations of vulgar nationalism and said that "there 
must be severe penalities for racial abuse." 
  All these conclusions are correct but are they not too late? 
  In addition, the author of the message ignored questions 
relating to the domestic political reorganization in Kazakhstan. 
He believes, among other things, that the best option would to 
be reform parliament as a bicameral body, empowering it to 
impeach the president and empowering the president to dissolve 
parliament. There must also be a fundamental restructuring of 
the legal system. 
  As for the activity of the government, which is presently 
receiving most criticism, the president said that the Cabinet of 
Ministers should be given carte blanche for 15 months in order 
to implement the updated program of anticrisis measures. 
  However, that did not stop N. Nazarbayev from carrying out a 
reorganization and a reshuffle in the government cabinet 
literally just a couple of days later. 
  The most interesting of the cadre reshuffles is the 
appointment of 40-year old Kozykorpesh Yesenberlin, head of the 
Alemsistem Finance and Investment Corporation, one of the 
largest nonstate production and commercial structures in 
Kazakhstan, to one of the key posts in the government -- 
chairman of the State Committee for State Property. Whatever 
else, it is hard to describe the change of holders of government 
portfolios as anything other than positive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Council Chairman Babken Ararktsyan </F>
by Liana Minasyan in Moscow under the "Peacekeeping" rubric; 
date of interview not given: "Loss of Momentum by Peacekeepers 
May Lead to Escalation of Karabakh Conflict. Chairman of 
Armenia's Supreme Council Babken Ararktsyan on Parliamentarians' 
Role in Settling the Crisis"] 
  [Text] [Minasyan] Does the situation in the national 
parliaments affect the work of the Interparliamentary Assembly 
[IPA], from whose sitting you have come to Moscow? Is it going 
to be a sort of a supra-parliamentary organ or will it remain in 
its present capacity? 
  [Ararktsyan] The IPA Council is indeed a "speakers' club" of 
sorts. But during plenary sessions it is not just the speakers' 
own points of view that clash, because the Armenian delegation 
and the other delegations represent all the political forces. 
Clashes are natural under these circumstances. Besides, inside 
the "speakers' club" itself there are very many different 
approaches, but since decisions are reached through consensus, 
proposals that cannot be accepted at once have to be given a 
"blander" form. I am going to speak about the question that was 
before the latest IPA Council in St. Petersburg. The Bishkek 
protocol recorded Shumeyko's and Sherimkulov's initiative that 
the parliaments of the CIS-member countries should approve the 
idea of creating CIS peacekeeping forces. The IPA Council was 
also asked to support this proposal, but Azerbaijan blocked it. 
  [Minasyan] Was anyone else against? 
  [Ararktsyan] Clearly not. Moldavia [Moldova] had some 
doubts, but had it come to voting, they would not have vetoed 
it, I think. Azerbaijan was against, and the decision was not 
made but will be taken up again in the autumn. 
  [Minasyan] What caused Mr. Guliyev's doubts? 
  [Ararktsyan] This is a very important question politically 
-- the presence on Azerbaijan's territory of peacekeeping forces 
of the CIS or Russia. They have either made no final decision 
or are against. 
  [Ninasyan] Maybe the whole thing would boil down to giving 
the Russian forces the flag of the CIS coalition? 
  [Ararktsyan] The peacekeeping forces are not only the 
subunits that are going to participate in peacekeeping 
operations. Many CIS countries are ready to give them material 
assistance, say, to supply technical equipment -- this is also 
participation. I know that some countries are ready to also 
provide military contingents. Thus, one should not identify CIS 
peacekeeping forces with Russian troops -- this of course causes 
anxiety in the political quarters of different countries. No 
one, Russia included, objects to the presence of international 
forces. But the CSCE has no peacekeeping subunits, only the 
United Nations does. The fears are that getting the mandate and 
finances may take time while the fragile truce that now holds in 
the conflict region may be broken at any time. Therefore the 
loss of momentum may amount to an escalation of the conflict. 
  [Minasyan] As a regional organization, can the CIS give its 
mandate to these troops? 
  [Ararktsyan] It can. International organizations, too, can 
give their own mandate -- no one objects to this. 
  [Minasyan] What caused Shumeyko's appearance among the 
mediators? 
  [Ararktsyan] Shumeyko was elected chairman of the IPA, the 
decision on the creation of a peacemaking group for Nagorno 
Karabakh was made back last year, and he was naturally supposed 
to join in this work. He also played a great role in the 
signing of the Bishkek protocol. 
  [Minasyan] How can this problem be solved at the level of 
parliaments? 
  [Ararktsyan] I, of course, realize very well that this is a 
job for the executive. Parliaments can only recommend these or 
other steps -- the Bishkek protocol also contained 
recommendations of this sort. But sooner or later, when 
agreements have been signed, they have to be ratified by the 
Supreme Council. And ratification will be made easier if 
parliament joins the effort at an early stage. 
  [Minasyan] Did the quadripartite meeting on Karabakh take 
place in St. Petersburg after all? 
  [Ararktsyan] There was a very exciting exchange of views 
between Shumeyko, Guliyev and myself, and Baburin. The very 
fact that this meeting was attended by the chairman of the 
Karabakh parliament shows that there is progress in the talks. 
Undoubtedly, that was an informal conversation that entails no 
obligations. 
  [Minasyan] Can the implementation of the Russian 
peacekeeping plan meet with opposition in the Armenian 
parliament? 
  [Ararktsyan] The plan suggested by Armenia's leaders for two 
years -- the establishment of a guaranteed peace with the 
bringing in of peacekeeping forces followed by talks on the 
political status of Nagorno-Karabakh -- is being backed in 
general forms by almost all political forces. The mechanism for 
carrying it through, of course, causes differences. Some 
radical forces have their own stance on the fundamental question 
-- they believe the status of Nagorno-Karabakh should be defined 
immediately. However, making haste on the question of status 
could deadlock the current preliminary round of talks. 
  [Minasyan] Does the possible presence of Russian troops in 
Karabakh cause displeasure? 
  [Ararktsyan] It does not. There are no important 
differences on this question.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Bank President Nodar Javakhishvili </F>
by Klara Grigolia; place and date not given: "How Are We To 
Overcome Hyperinflation?"] 
  [Excerpts] The process of hyperinflation is raging. In 
the view of our society, the prospects for halting it are 
hopeless. There is only one glimmer of hope -- the 
implementation of a severe financial and credit policy. We 
spoke about this vitally important problem to Nodar 
Javakhishvili, president of the Republic of Georgia National 
Bank. [passage omitted] 
  [Javakhishvili] How can we overcome hyperinflation? We have 
to start without delay to live within our means for at least two 
to three months; that is to say, the Georgian population and 
economy should use only what is produced. This concerns gas, 
electric power, food products, and, in general, everything. 
There is no perfect [system of] social justice. It is not 
possible to save our country in the situation it is in under the 
aegis of a perfect [system of] social justice. Far more 
injustice will be committed under the aegis of social justice. 
For example, the population is practically not being made to 
pay taxes and if it is paying something, this is not to the 
advantage of the state. The sole payer for the gas being 
consumed is the republican budget whose source is the credit 
emission from the National Bank; that is to say, with the money 
used to pay for the gas being consumed, we are increasing the 
amount of the money supply in circulation that has not been 
secured and, in this way, money belonging to all citizens of 
Georgia, including those who do not use gas, is being devalued. 
Tbilisi, Rustavi, and Kutaisi are being supplied with gas; that 
is to say, the price of gas consumed by me as an inhabitant of 
Tbilisi is also being paid for by a peasant from Kiziqi through 
the imposition of an inflationary tax; all the more so because, 
in the environs of Tbilisi, many families use gas for heating, 
hot water, and most importantly, for their hothouses. This 
means that we have to change our psychology -- proceed not from 
what we want or need, but according to our means; we should aim 
to extend those means and use them efficiently, that is to say, 
in reality, we should not have a budget deficit. A budget 
deficit means more is being spent than earned; it is another 
matter that we increase budgetary incomes (we are also obliged 
to do so) at the expense of levying taxes. We should refrain 
from issuing credits; this will bring instant stability to the 
money market, although it will also not be our final salvation; 
this will signify only a reduction of the temperature. However, 
if we reduce this temperature, international society and, in 
particular, the IMF, World Bank, and the European Bank [for 
Reconstruction and Development] are ready today to render us 
real and extensive assistance -- financial assistance -- that 
should revive production and gradually secure a saturation of 
goods on the consumer market. 
  At the same time, we should reduce the temperature with our 
forces; this is their one firm condition, that is to say, either 
we should continue to consume within today's parameters -- if we 
consume just gas to the value of $300 million annually and 
produce only one-tenth of this, we will alienate international 
financial institutions that are keen to help us -- or we should 
limit consumption for a few months in accordance with the 
country's real potential. 
  Reducing the rate of inflation means that there should be an 
improvement in the exchange rate of the coupon to the dollar and 
a fall in the value of the dollar against the coupon. For 
example, today, a salary of 500,000 coupons is equivalent to 
half a dollar; if we reduce the inflation rate by 50 percent, 
one dollar will be equivalent to 250,000 coupons. 
Correspondingly, the population's savings will become more 
solid and gradually increase in value in reality. We should not 
concern ourselves with increasing wages, but with making them 
more solid and strengthening the coupon. 
  Regarding the loans issued by the National Bank, retrieving 
them has been entrusted to the law enforcement bodies and a 
large part has already been recovered; however, there are still 
many things that have to be done regarding those persons who 
have left the republic. The law enforcement bodies are actively 
working on this. 
  However, the problem is that the basic loans that have been 
issued have been covered at face value, which we cannot call 
being covered in reality as 100 million rubles lent in February 
of last year is covered by 100 million coupons this year; this 
represents practically no cover. It is necessary that profit 
obtained as a result of the rate of inflation as hidden income 
should be retrieved to the benefit of the state budget by the 
corresponding law enforcement bodies, better still by the Tax 
Inspectorate; this will be the most serious blow against 
inflation and it is my firm belief that it will reduce the 
budget deficit as this amounts to approximately $300 million. 
  As for the coupon, from the very first day it was 
introduced, 
this was a temporary transitional unit of payment; as can been 
seen from its name, the coupon cannot be called money. It is a 
part of securities that are given to its owner to enable him to 
receive the dividend belonging to him. However, I believe that 
we should achieve stability on the basis of this same coupon so 
that we can protect real Georgian money. We are thinking of 
introducing the lari [name of future new Georgian currency] 
during the initial period of stability, but this will only 
happen when we are conceptually absolutely ready for monetary 
reform and, what is no less important, when we will have 
financial guarantees that it will not suffer the same fate as 
the coupon. The IMF is virtually giving us such guarantees 
provided we fulfill their demands. 
  My attitude to the ruble zone is a negative one as I cannot 
realistically envisage the creation of a ruble zone and our 
having any prospects within it. Nobody should think that Russia 
will accept such a country into the ruble zone and provide it 
with funds and notes whose level of inflation is 10 times 
higher, which in itself means that Russia will automatically and 
without compensation assume responsibility for nine-tenths of 
the country's general expenses. They will certainly demand from 
us that we do not allow there to be a budget deficit and that we 
bring credit emission and the inflation level into line with one 
another. In the event of our implementing such measures, our 
money will be on a par with the Russian ruble and the ruble zone 
will have no significance at all for us; it will have already by 
then resulted in the loss of the country's most important 
attribute of sovereignty. 
  Today, very many people are speculating about the European 
Union [EU] and the ECU although no one should think that the ECU 
is a real monetary unit in Europe. In spite of trying for 
decades and taking into account that the level of development of 
[Western] European countries is very similar in each case, they 
have been unable to achieve this aim in Europe; we can only 
think about this when the former Soviet republics will have 
similar economic levels, which, as in the case of the European 
Union, will take decades. 
  Managing the country's economy, particularly bringing it out 
of the very deep crisis, cannot be done by a monetary and credit 
policy alone; it is necessary for all levels of power and the 
whole of society to work in one direction; we are currently at 
war, that is to say we are struggling to save the country's 
statehood. 
  I view my minimum program as obtaining real assistance from 
the international financial institutions and my maximum program 
as building a truly independent state by means of a highly 
developed banking system. Probably the reason why I can never 
inwardly agree to the National Bank issuing loans today is that 
we are dealing here with credit emission or money that does not 
exist, which, in every case, leads to an acceleration in the 
rate of inflation and is a mechanism for levying taxes upon the 
population. 
  In today's conditions, there are very many things that we 
need to do. We have already begun the training of specialists 
for the banking system in Georgia, which is being undertaken by 
the German Banking Academy under the aegis and with the 
financial support of the European Union. There should be 280 
trained specialists within one and a half years.

  [Text] Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys has 
essentially given a favorable assessment to the meeting of the 
foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council held 
in Istanbul last Friday. 
  According to the minister, the politicians had an open 
exchange of opinions, but on some issues the dialogue was rather 
tough. Among such issues, Povilas Gylys mentioned at a news 
conference on Monday Russia's stance on the new partners of the 
West European Union. According to the minister, the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council intended to welcome the granting of 
the status of partners of the West European Union to nine 
Central European countries, including the Baltic states. 
However, under Russian pressure, it limited itself to 
mentioning this fact in the final communique of the meeting. 
  Povilas Gylys said that a strong and negative reaction by 
some participants in the meeting was provoked by Russia's hints 
about a possible revision of the treaty on the reduction of 
conventional arms in Europe. Russia endeavors to link the 
demilitarization of the Kaliningrad region with the possibility 
of maintaining larger armed forces on its northern and southern 
borders. This was categorically opposed by Turkey. 
  Minister Povilas Gylys stated at the news conference that 
Lithuania is interested in the demilitarization of Kaliningrad, 
but at the same time understands the importance of the treaty on 
the reduction of conventional arms in Europe. Lithuania cannot 
be excluded from the European context, Povilas Gylys stated, 
adding that it would not be practical to maintain that Lithuania 
can influence that process.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "The President Confirmed His </F>
Choice in Favor of Reforms and Democracy"] 
  [Text] On the eve of his third anniversary in the post of 
president of Russia B. Yeltsin made a number of statements at a 
news conference which give grounds for regarding this generally 
ordinary measure as the most important internal political event 
not just of last week. For the first time since the 12 December 
elections and referendum the country's public was able to gain a 
clear idea of the president's economic and internal political 
principles and plans. 
  Yeltsin's new political strategy was essentially made public 
at the news conference. Its essence seems to be that the 
president of Russia is largely restoring the status which he had 
at the end of 1991, once again becoming an informal prime 
minister, placing leadership of the executive under his direct 
control, reforming the economy, and governing the country with 
the help of edicts. At the same time the president's staff is 
becoming, as it were, a second branch of the executive, 
entrusted with formulating economic strategy. The tackling of 
current problems has been left to the government. 
  Yeltsin's statements also make it possible to conclude that 
there have been serious political changes in his position. The 
period of vacillation -- echoes of which, in particular, were 
reaching the public in the form of diverse rumors of cardinal 
reshuffles in the system of the executive -- seems to have ended 
for the president. Russia's economic situation has made him 
finally choose one of two options: Either movement toward 
building an open country with a civilized market economy, or 
reversion to a closed militarized state. The president, as far 
as can be judged from his statements, has definitely chosen the 
first option and thereby restored his image as a reforming 
democrat. 
  Thus, today it is possible to draw three definite 
conclusions: Yeltsin has chosen the optimum political and 
economic course, he has clearly demonstrated that he remains a 
reforming president, and, for the first time since the new 
Constitution was adopted, he has broken through the interests of 
the nomenklatura and shown himself to be a leader capable of 
making strategic decisions. Right now there are grounds for hope 
that Russia will succeed in extricating itself from the crisis 
with the minimal upheaval. 
  Undoubtedly, the economic situation will not yet improve 
quickly. Possible attempts to destabilize the economic and 
internal political situation cannot be ruled out. After his 
news conference the president has gotten two powerful -- both 
politically and economically -- new opponents: a section of the 
commercial banks and a section of the Army. He has confronted 
the former with the prospect of being squeezed in the vise of 
increased state control and increased competition from foreign 
colleagues, and the latter with the threat of radical reduction. 
Thus, a temporary tactical alliance between these forces and 
the opposition appears perfectly real. Nevertheless, there are 
grounds for believing that it is perfectly realistic to preserve 
political stability in Russia. 
  This is primarily borne out by the president's statement 
that 
he has no intention of changing the government or the premier. 
By taking on the formulation of economic strategy, Yeltsin has 
encroached upon V. Chernomyrdin's competence, since the 
worsening state of the economy was weakening the president's 
political positions. But at the same time he extended a hand to 
him at a difficult time by stating officially that there can be 
no question of any "surrender" of Chernomyrdin. Of course, 
something similar was also heard in the past in respect of Ye. 
Gaydar and Yu. Petrov. But in this case there are weighty 
reasons to believe that words will not be at variance with 
actions, at least in the immediate future. This assumption is 
also confirmed by the blow which the president dealt during the 
news conference to A. Chubays and V. Kvasov -- Chernomyrdin's 
opponents in the government. 
  A rather unique situation has been created. While having 
weakened Chernomyrdin as premier and as an administrator, at the 
same time Yeltsin has strengthened him as a political figure. 
And not just by refuting the rumors of a change of government. 
  After his news conference it will probably no longer be 
possible for Yeltsin to reach agreement with the opposition. 
But Chernomyrdin will be perfectly able to work with it. It 
could essentially be a question of creating a political alliance 
between the president and the premier in which the former holds 
the political right flank and the center, while the latter holds 
the center and the slightly left flank. It seems far from 
coincidental that it was precisely the center and the opposition 
in the Duma that supported the draft budget submitted by the 
government, as well as the fact that, to judge from statements 
by opposition leaders, they are not nurturing plans to remove 
the premier but advocate only a presidential election. Although 
the chief credit for the fact that the Duma adopted this, the 
most optimum version of the budget, should undoubtedly go to M. 
Zadornov, chairman of the Budget Committee, whose speech at the 
session placed him, without exaggeration, you might say, at the 
peak of the Russian political and economic elite, on a par with 
Gaydar and G. Yavlinskiy. 
  Yeltsin, to judge from his statements, has found his second 
most important point of support in the leaders of the Russian 
regions. The most graphic evidence of this is provided by his 
unequivocal support for Yu. Luzhkov in his conflict with 
Chubays. There is no doubt that the other regional leaders will 
also demand for themselves rights analogous with those accorded 
the mayor of Moscow. At any rate, a similar statement has 
already been heard from the leaders of "Siberian Agreement." If 
you consider the fact that an accord has already been reached 
between Yeltsin and the Russian governors on the transfer of the 
regional apparatus to their control, then it is possible to 
believe that these aspirations too will not go unsatisfied. 
Yeltsin has also managed to substantially improve relations 
with the republic leaders, as evidenced most vividly by his 
recent visit to Tatarstan. 
  Finally, the third support necessary for full stability 
seems 
to have been found in the leadership of the central bureaucratic 
apparatus. The president's phrase about the corruptness of 
precisely the middle echelon of managers may be regarded as a 
guarantee that top officials will not suffer such persecution. 
This, in turn, destroys the monolith of the bureaucratic 
apparatus, weakens its influence, and creates preconditions for 
establishing control over it. 
  According to information available in the editorial office, 
during the president's meeting with Gaydar at the beginning of 
last week Yeltsin complained, in particular, that the 
apparatuses of the government and of the president's staff have 
grown incredibly and become unmanageable. Previously the mass 
media repeatedly voiced opinions that the head of state was 
increasingly becoming a hostage of the bureaucratic apparatus. 
But now, as we see, the president is trying to break through 
this ring. 
  The distribution of forces on the Russian political scene 
following Yeltsin's news conference appears as follows: In 
addition to the national-communist opposition, a section of the 
Army and the military-industrial complex is becoming 
concentrated in the camp of the president's opponents, with a 
section of the commercial banks and also a section of the 
central bureaucratic apparatus as temporary, tactical partners. 
Mainly the middle link. Among the forces which support the 
president there are, above all, the government, the majority of 
the regional leaders, the oil and gas complex, and the West. 
The president can also count on the support of Russian 
democratic forces. Evidently, it was for precisely this reason 
that he did not even send greetings to the founding congress of 
the "Russia's Democratic Choice" party. Not wishing to tie 
himself to a single party, Yeltsin proposes, to all appearances, 
to rely on the whole spectrum of democratic forces, whose 
congress, as is known, is planned for the fall. Incidentally, 
such a strategy seems the optimum and probably also the only 
possible one for Yeltsin if he has already made the decision to 
run in the next presidential election. If this is so, it means 
that we are talking of a strategy virtually chosen by the 
president for the next two years. 
  Such a political balance and also the energy and the 
capacity 
for work which the president has been displaying for quite some 
time provide grounds for forecasting that, despite the economic 
crisis, the political situation in Russia will remain stable for 
the time being. No serious upheavals are expected, apart from 
some cadre reshuffles in the government.

  [Text] "...The staff should be seriously purged, led by 
Kvasov, they have gone and enrolled so many that it will take a 
long time yet to sort it out...." 
  The mention of Vladimir Kvasov, the government chief of 
staff, in direct connection with the problem of corruption is 
one of the sensational statements Yeltsin made during his recent 
press conference. There have been many rumors, being 
increasingly confirmed, about the influence Kvasov has gained in 
the power structures. Correspondingly, his now inevitable fall 
could reshape the pattern of connections between members of the 
staff and affect the moods of those holding a number of high 
positions. True, it is not clear if all this may lead to 
official or closed proceedings, as it is not clear from the 
statement what Kvasov is guilty of: making incompetent 
decisions that gave a free hand to corrupt officials, or 
deliberately conniving with them. 
  It is also tempting to explain the president's statement in 
terms of the desire to keep Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin "under 
control." However, the presidential initiative was clearly 
agreed with the premier: A conflict between Chernomyrdin and 
Kvasov who was trying to play his own cards and to gradually 
take the staff from under the premier's influence had long been 
brewing. Besides, Yeltsin vigorously denied rumors of 
Chernomyrdin's probable resignation, stating: "I'm not going to 
surrender Chernomyrdin." Still questions remain. First, the 
president used the same phrase about Gaydar well-nigh on the eve 
of the latter's quitting as premier. Second, it is not clear who 
Chernomyrdin should have been "surrendered" to. Unlike Gaydar, 
whose head was demanded on all sides, Viktor Stepanovich's 
position is firm, so the natural question is who is out to "get" 
him?

  [Text] North Korea will have to face hard times, Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists on Tuesday [14 
June]. 
  Commenting on the decision of North Korea to cease its 
participation in the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
Zlenko said he believed it would be very difficult to confront 
the whole world community which stands for the elimination of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Zlenko repeated that the position of Ukraine had been made 
clear during the recent visit of the North Korean foreign 
minister. He said Ukraine was hoping that North Korea was 
moving towards a non-nuclear status. On this basis, Kiev is 
ready to cooperate with North Korea, Zlenko added.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 16 ITAR-TASS -- "The president is 
resolutely supporting the Central Bank of Russia as the single 
federal body the regulation of which is Moscow's exclusive 
prerogative," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA writes today. "It is not only 
that local authorities have been trying to command Central Bank 
subsidiaries on their territories. The president's approach is 
dealing the final blow to the smoldering plans for turning the 
Bank of Russia into something resembling the U.S. Federal 
Reserve system with characteristically high autonomy of the 
regional banks within the system, plans resolutely opposed by 
the present leadership of the Central Bank". 
  The same newspaper carries an interview with Colonel-General 
Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the first deputy chief of the External 
Intelligence Service, who stresses that "as concerns the 
composition of the world's top league of intelligence services 
and the place different services occupy in it, we have always 
been in that league and, I would like to believe, we shall 
always remain in it. I am sure that should the personnel of our 
rival services be placed in the conditions in which the Russian 
Intelligence Service now finds itself, many would not be able to 
cope. While ours are serving and will continue to serve". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an open appeal of Russian and 
foreign specialists to the president, government and Federal 
Assembly of the Russian Federation, which reads, "Russia has 
three key sources of its unique potential for effective 
development and a sure place among the world's leading nations. 
First of all, the country has immense reserves of 
fuel-and-energy and mineral resources, fertile land and other 
natural riches. Russia's per capita resource potential is twice 
that of the United States, six times that of Germany and 18-20 
times that of Japan. Secondly, Russia has a unique potential in 
its army of highly-qualified specialists and scientists capable 
of solving the most complex problems in the field of science, 
technology and production. And at last thirdly, it has a mighty 
production base which is second to none in a number of fields. 
Nonetheless, a striking contrast exists between the country's 
colossal potential for prosperity and the bleak reality. 
Regrettably, Russia's economic potential has been used not to 
ensure its prosperity but to pay the cost of abortive economic 
experiments". 
  Commenting on the situation in Tajikistan the same newspaper 
says "eighteen months have elapsed since the end of open civil 
war in Tajikistan. But the triumph of "anti-Islamists" has 
brought about no long-awaited stability to the republic. There 
is no single Tajikistan any more. The republic is divided into 
dwarfish semi- feudal states with their regional armies and 
leaders. Incidentally it is not the traditional strongholds of 
the opposition which are the greatest danger to Dushanbe but the 
regions where the advent of the new power was greeted with 
enthusiasm in the not so recent past". 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA centers around the situation on 
the Korean peninsula: "It is quite possible that the story about 
the North Korean nuclear potential is another political bluff. 
When the winner bluffs people tend to believe him. If the 
bluff is eventually called, the loss will be relatively painless 
for one side, but the nerves of the less fortunate partners, 
already strained in the course of the game, might snap, and then 
more and more faulty moves are likely to be made". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comment on the same situation: "In the 
opinion of the majority of the countries no state can be granted 
"a special status" under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as 
sought after by North Korea. This is most important not only 
for nuclear security on the Korean peninsula but also for non- 
proliferation in the whole world, because precedent might be 
created which will tempt other states which wish to join the 
nuclear club". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that "the presidential staff 
and 
the security council are thinking about a merger of the Federal 
Counter- Intelligence Service and the Main Directorate of Guards 
of the Russian Federation. If the merger takes place, the new 
service will probably be headed by Mikhail Barsukov who is now 
chief of the directorate. FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin is likely 
to be appointed first deputy". 
  According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the leadership of Georgia 
believe that the beginning of Russia's peacekeeping operation 
in Abkhazia will accelerate the settlement of the conflict in 
the region. That Russia's politicians and military have taken 
up the settlement of the conflict is, in their opinion, a sing 
of Russia's peace-making potential for resolving conflicts on 
the territory of the former Soviet Union". 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes an interview with Army General 
Valentin Varennikov who refused to be amnestied for his role in 
the August 1991 putsch and demanded a new trial. The general 
said in the interview: "I understand that the authorities do not 
need the trial, they would rather have me agree to the amnesty. 
On the other hand since I put up a resistance, they undoubtedly 
feel like teaching me a lesson and demonstrate that all other 
members of the GKCHP (the State Committee for State Emergency 
which planned the abortive coup) are guilty. I do not rule out 
such a turn of events. But I still hope that we have people 
capable of doing justice impartially, on the basis of law". 
  PRAVDA reports that "while in Irkutsk Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
condemned Communism, the Soviet era and the changes now underway 
in the country. He said "Gorbachev destroyed the system that 
was, but it should not have been destroyed. It should have been 
revivified very slowly from below - beginning with the 
distribution of plots of land, with the organisation of small 
workshops and retail outlets". The writer added that "reforms 
are proceeding without a plan. The deregulation of the prices 
is robbery, privatisation is playing into the hands of 
criminals, and it should be dealt with by prosecutors and 
investigators. We now have oligarchy and not democracy". 
Solzhenitsyn was also skeptical about the Civic Concord 
agreement.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (TASS) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev today confirmed that he was prepared to meet U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the near future to 
agree on a common approach to a settlement of the situation on 
the Korean peninsula. An accord on such a meeting of the heads 
of the foreign policy departments of the two countries was 
reached in the course of the telephone conversation the other 
day between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. 
  Speaking in a talk with journalists about the date for this 
dialogue, Andrey Kozyrev said, among other things: "As for the 
meeting of ministers of which the presidents spoke, I proposed 
to my friend and colleague Warren Christopher specific dates for 
this meeting, and I am awaiting a reply from him on specific 
dates. It goes without saying that I am prepared to meet in the 
nearest future and at a time convenient for both sides, in order 
to continue the work as the presidents agreed, that is, to work 
out a joint approach to this extraordinarily complicated 
question."

<F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Moscow and Washington Trying to </F>
Work Out Unified Position on Korean Crisis"] 
  [Text] Pyongyang's statement that it is quitting the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, sharply exacerbating the 
situation on the Korean Peninsula, leaves Russia and the United 
States facing the need to work out a unified position so as to 
counter Kim Il-song's nuclear blackmail more effectively. 
  Tuesday's phone call between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton 
was mainly devoted to the Korea crisis. Judging by the 
statement made by the Russian president after the conversation, 
the Moscow and Washington positions are now essentially similar 
[sushchestvenno sblizilis]. The United States, as Yeltsin put 
it, no longer objects to the Russian idea, put forward a few 
months ago, of holding an international conference on Korea. 
The Kremlin, for its part, has agreed to discuss at this forum 
the question of introducing sanctions against the DPRK -- U.S. 
diplomats are insisting on on the need for them. 
  The Korean problem will be one of the main points on the 
agenda for the talks to be held very shortly between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. The exact date is not yet known. President 
Yeltsin had gotten somewhat heated and told journalists that 
Kozyrev would be flying to Brussels to meet with his U.S. 
colleague virtually tomorrow. But it transpired that the 
secretary of state has a Near East tour planned and will only be 
able to see the Russian minister once it is over. 
  As of the morning of 15 June the Russian Foreign Ministry 
and 
the State Department had not yet coordinated the question of a 
timetable for the forthcoming meeting. 
  IZVESTIYA was told by Kozyrev's entourage that, apart from 
the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the minister and 
secretary of state plan to discuss preparations for the Russian 
president's visit to the United States, scheduled for September.

  [Text] Moscow, 15 June -- The DPRK's departure from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been received with 
great concern in Russia. This was stated at a briefing today by 
Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of administration of the 
Information and Press Department of the Russian Federation 
Foreign Ministry . 
  "Our fundamental position is well known and remains 
immutable. Russia favors strengthening the regime of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and favors transparency of 
nuclear programs so that no doubts or fears will arise 
concerning the possibility of attempts to create nuclear 
weaponry. It is especially important that a state which is a 
member of the treaty and which has an agreement with the IAEA on 
guarantees should honestly and consistently fulfill its 
obligations. If this has not been done or is not being done, 
then the international community has the right to react 
appropriately," the Russian diplomat said.

  [Text] Mikhail Beliy, director of the First Asia Department 
in the Foreign Ministry, in an interview today to our television 
company, told us about Russia's reaction to N. Korea's 
withdrawal from the IAEA. 
  [Begin Beliy recording] We are not inclined to dramatize the 
DPRK's Announced withdrawal from the IAEA since we proceed from 
the basis that the DPRK remains a participant-member of the Non- 
Proliferation Treaty, and therefore has an agreement with the 
IAEA within the framework of that treaty. Therefore, 
inspections of nuclear sites in the DPRK should continue. 
  We are in close contact with the other five permanent 
members 
of the UN Security Council and we are beginning to prepare a 
draft resolution. An agreement has been reached that, in the 
very near future, the Russian foreign minister and the U.S. 
secretary of state will meet. [end recording] 
  Russia believes that tough UN sanctions against the DPRK is 
an extreme measure. However, if there is going to be talk of 
sanctions, then Russia will insist that they must be gradual and 
also take into account its own interests.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Filippov: "Dangerous Test of Strength. </F>
Pyongyang Does Not Intend to Yield"] 
  [Text] The unresolved state of the crisis connected with 
the verification of the DPRK's nuclear potential is making the 
situation in the East Asian region more complex by the hour, 
reviving gloomy recollections of the bloody Korean war into 
which the United States, China, and the USSR were also drawn. 
Discussions concerning the checking of nuclear installations in 
North Korea are giving way to open threats about the use of 
force, including military force. 
  The situation is dangerous because in the event of an armed 
conflict, apart from the North and South Korean Armies, the 
40,000-strong U.S. corps stationed in the south of the peninsula 
will also be drawn into it. 
  North Korea has completed preparations for war on the Korean 
peninsula, but as yet there are no particular signs in its steps 
of readiness for armed provocations against Seoul. ROK Defense 
Minister Yi Pyong-tae stated as much on Thursday, reading a 
report in the military commission of the South Korean parliament. 
  From what he said, toward the end of July 1993 a special 
staff was created in the DPRK to prepare for war, and weapons 
and other military industry output were accumulated in 
underground stores. Long-range self-propelled guns and rocket 
launchers, presenting danger to the South Korean capital, were 
placed in the foremost position near the DMZ dividing the 
peninsula. 
  According to information from North Korean sources in 
Moscow, 
if there is an armed conflict, all eight nuclear electric power 
stations on the territory of South Korea could be targets for 
bombing strikes. 
  After that, so specialists believe, Chernobyl will look like 
a light-hearted prelude to a real tragedy. 
  The Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN, citing the manual circulated 
among servicemen of the American contingent in South Korea, has 
published figures about the correlation of forces on the Korean 
peninsula. Becuase its forces are inferior to the U.S. and South 
Korean forces opposing them in terms of technical equipment, 
intelligence and tracking systems, and targeting and guidance 
systems, the DPRK is trying to compensate for this with enhanced 
maneuverability, training for action at night and in poor 
visibility, and concentrating troops in the main salients, and 
also by numerical superiority. In the event of an attack, the 
DPRK will outnumber the combined American and South Korean 
forces in manpower by six to one, in tanks and armored vehicles 
by five to one, and in artillery by eight to one. 
  A possible attack, the newspaper believes, could be 
organized 
in three directions: Along the west and east coasts of the 
peninsula, and also down the central valley. The most important 
role, U.S. intelligence believes, will be played in this by the 
60,000-strong DPRK special-purpose crack troops, whose mission 
is to disrupt enemy rear services. 
  "If Japan heads or joins any sanctions against the DPRK we 
will consider this a declaration of war, and Japan will not 
escape proper retribution," a North Korean Foreign Ministry 
statement transmitted by the KCNA agency says. 
  The worsening crisis is highlighting completely new problems 
concerning North Korea's nuclear potential. As THE NEW YORK 
TIMES believes, "North Korea could complete the process of 
enriching the nuclear fuel recently removed from its nuclear 
reactor in Yongbyon and obtain enough plutonium to make four or 
five bombs by the end of this year." 
  At the same time THE WASHINGTON TIMES, citing well-informed 
sources, writes that the operation to remove fuel from the 
nuclear reactor in Yongbyon has caused "renewed" alarm in U.S. 
intelligence departments. In this connection, concern is being 
expressed that Pyongyang "could" pass on a nuclear device, 
fissile materials, or technology to certain states in the Near 
East. The potential buyers are being named as Iran, Iraq, 
Libya, and Syria. 
  The powers with a profound interest in resolving the crisis 
on the Korean Peninsula have not yet arrived at a unanimous 
opinion on what action to take in the immediate future. 
  The United States has drawn up a draft UN Security Council 
resolution providing for the imposition of an economic embargo 
against Pyongyang but has not yet familiarized other countries 
with its text. This was reported to THE NEW YORK TIMES by "U.S. 
officials" at the UN headquarters. 
  According to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, "the most 
urgent task at present is for the UN Security Council to adopt a 
resolution on the introduction of sanctions against North Korea." 
  Moscow, despite increasing appeals to the DPRK over the 
suspicions that it is developing its own nuclear weapons, still 
believes that this problem should be resolved within the 
framework of the international conference proposed by Russia in 
accordance with the "six plus two" formula. This was confirmed 
in an interview with ITAR-TASS by Russian Federation Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. 
  "Our position remains as before: We advocate a conference at 
which this question must be resolved," the high-ranking Russian 
diplomat said. "Since the dialogue failed at the bilateral 
level, it must be resolved on a multilateral level." 
  This initiative has not yet met with support. 
  China is opposed to the use of sanctions against the DPRK, a 
spokesman for the PRC Foreign Ministry declared Thursday, 
reporting on the working talks between PRC Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen and ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu on the nuclear 
problem on the Korean Peninsula. 
  The speediest resumption of talks is the best way to resolve 
the DPRK nuclear problem. The use of sanctions can only 
exacerbate the problem and increase confrontation between the 
sides involved, the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out. 
  The likelihood of separate U.S., Japanese, and South Korean 
sanctions against the DPRK is "extremely low" at present -- so 
said a Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership spokesman at a Tokyo 
meeting Wednesday with foreign policy experts from the Liberal 
Democratic Party, the leading opposition party. 
  Tokyo does not believe, however, that there is any point in 
the present situation in giving serious study to Russia's 
proposals for holding an international conference on the Korean 
Peninsula with the participation of the two Korean states, 
China, Russia, the United States, Japan, the United Nations, and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. The ITAR-TASS Agency 
was told this by a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official. 
  He pointed out that Tokyo now intends to try to resolve the 
problem of Pyongyang's nuclear program mainly on the basis of 
close consultations with the United States and South Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Platkovskiy: "Why Does the Great </F>
Leader Need a Big Bomb?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Anything Can Be Hidden in </H5>
Catacombs 
  In the summer of 1990 Eduard Shevardnadze, who was foreign 
minister at the time, conducted exhaustive talks with the North 
Koreans, trying to explain to them the necessity of Moscow's 
imminent diplomatic recognition of Seoul. His Pyongyang 
counterpart, Kim Yong-nam, was under orders from Kim Il-song to 
employ every means to block Moscow's move, a move which 
undermined the leader's [vozhd] concept of the existence of a 
"sole legitimate state" on the Korean peninsula -- the DPRK. 
Having exhausted the range of diplomatic devices, Kim Yong-nam 
produced what was intended to be the trump card: Pyongyang 
"will consider itself free of all commitments not to create 
nuclear weapons" if Gorbachev starts cooperating with the "South 
Korean puppets." 
  Shevardnadze countered the blackmail bid in his 
characteristic emotional and trenchant manner. He attached no 
significance to the threat. Meanwhile Moscow did not believe in 
the seriousness of reports that American spy satellites had 
detected installations in North Korea for reprocessing nuclear 
fuel waste into plutonium. 
  The Russian intelligence service continues to deny today 
that 
Pyongyang has installations for manufacturing nuclear weapons. 
Our experts think that the North Koreans are banking on 
producing highly accurate intermediate- and long-range missiles. 
They can be equipped with chemical, bacteriological, or 
conventional warheads. These systems are sufficient, in our 
experts' opinion, for the purpose of "nuclear deterrence." 
There are nine nuclear electric power stations operating in 
South Korea, and a missile strike on them would be equivalent in 
its effect to a nuclear raid. 
  Our military specialists are struck by the naivete of the 
Americans in trusting the information supplied by their 
satellites: The North Koreans would never build a secret 
installation in the open. The North Koreans conceal all their 
strategic plants either underground or deep inside mountains, 
and these facilities are like whole cities on many levels. The 
North Koreans have built up a wealth of experience in this 
sphere since the war in the fifties. 
  There is nothing surprising in the fact that our and the 
American intelligence services differ in their assessments, 
although it may be that this is not a case where the truth will 
emerge out of controversy. CIA Director James Woolsey obviously 
has strong grounds for stating that there is proof that the DPRK 
has at least two nuclear weapons. According to the U.S. 
intelligence department chief, Pyongyang will be producing 10 to 
12 nuclear weapons per year in the future. 
<H5>  Cat-and-Mouse Games </H5>
  Pyongyang signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons in 1985. Just seven years later the North 
Koreans permitted inspectors of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] to carry out monitoring procedures. 
  IAEA representatives arrived in Yongbyon and made the North 
Koreans acknowledge that they had produced 98 grams of plutonium 
"for research purposes" from reactor waste in 1990, but 
investigation then established that this was not produced at the 
time indicated by the North Koreans. The inspectors threw up 
their hands in despair: How could they believe the statements 
that the North Koreans had no interest in plutonium -- it was 
deception. What they were doing in Yongbyon all the time there 
was no verification taking place could only be guessed at. 
  Another critical situation arose quite recently. It served 
as grounds for the IAEA to ask the UN Security Council to 
examine the possibility of introducing sanctions agaianst the 
DPRK. 
  A while ago the IAEA received information that in 1989 the 
Yongbyon reactor had been shut down in unscheduled fashion for 
100 days. The inspectors suspected something untoward: The 
shutdown of the reactor could have been used to remove some of 
the fuel rods and extract 10 to 16 kg of plutonium from them. 
The CIA immediately calculated that North Korea would be able 
to make four or five nuclear bombs with this plutonium. 
Patience was exhausted. An indignant Secretary of State 
Christopher demanded firm and resolute measures. Kim Il-song 
should not escape sanctions. 
<H5>  What Is In the Leader's Mind? </H5>
  A trade blockade is futile without the agreement of China, 
which supplies the DPRK with 70 percent of its oil and 60 
percent of its food. Beijing opposes sanctions against its 
ally. Logic suggests that in the event of a vote in the 
Security Council China would use its veto and block sanctions. 
Kim Il-song calculates that this is indeed what would happen 
and thus rests assured. Meanwhile he is making threatening 
gestures, stating that the DPRK will respond to a trade war by a 
real war. 
  What, then, is to be done about Kim Il-song? The first 
option is to introduce sanctions in one way or another and, if 
China refuses to go along with this, to do so sidestepping the 
Security Council, risking a conflict on the peninsula provoked 
by the North Koreans, with consequences which are difficult to 
guess. The second option is to resign ourselves to Kim 
Il-song's concealing plutonium for military purposes from the 
IAEA. 
  This latter scenario is absolutely unacceptable. Not just 
because it allows (even if only theoretically) the emergence of 
a new nuclear power -- the very idea of it fills you with dread. 
The most dangerous thing -- Washington, Moscow, Seoul, and 
Beijing are agreed on this -- will be the undermining of the 
international arrangements governing nonproliferation. And that 
will be a real nightmare. 
  But the first option is frightening by virtue of its 
unpredictability. 
  Observers come to the discomforting conclusion that there 
will be no sensible solution to the Korean nuclear problem at 
all as long as the present regime, which is concerned about its 
own survival and the upcoming transfer of power from Kim Il-song 
to his son, Kim Chong-il, exists in Pyongyang. Even if 
Washington does give diplomatic recognition to Pyongyang -- this 
is precisely what Kim Il-song is seeking, offering to freeze 
nuclear developments in exchange -- North Korea will find 
another way of keeping some other kind of "infernal secret" for 
new bargaining or blackmail purposes.

<F P=106> [Igor Galichin report under the "Contraband" rubric: "Kim </F>
Il- song Regime Increases Infiltration Into Russia. North 
Korean Citizens Bring Eight Kilograms of Heroin Into Russia"] 
  [Text] Your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned from 
competent sources that a successful operation was conducted in 
Maritime Kray a few days ago to stop an attempt to smuggle 
heroin from North Korea into Russia. The operation in this case 
was mounted simultaneously by several agencies: the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate for Combating Illicit 
Turnover of Drugs; the kray internal affairs administration; the 
Pacific Fleet Counterintelligence Service; border troops; and 
the local directorate of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service. According to information available to the editorial 
office, the events developed in the following manner: On 9 
June, operatives held two citizens of the North Korea on 
suspicion of smuggling in a big amount of narcotics from the 
territory of the DPRK. Their names have not been disclosed at 
the investigation's request. The detectives' expectations were 
justified: The check turned up eight kilograms of heroin in the 
possession of these citizens. Both North Koreans were arrested. 
Criminal proceedings have been instituted. The DPRK is a unique 
enclave where a Stalinist regime has been preserved in a 
classical form. The population in that country is under total 
surveillance by the special services, and to go abroad one has 
to go through the strictest screening. To smuggle such a large 
amount of the narcotic from North Korea without the deliberate 
connivance of the authorities appears most improbable. The 
value of the heroin seized from the DPRK citizens is $1 million 
at the going rate on the world drugs market, which is all the 
more impressive against the backdrop of the economic plight of 
Kim Il-song's regime.

  [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service [FSK], who is touring the Far East, 
today gave a news conference in Vladivostok. Stepashin gave the 
reasons for his Far East tour as: The increased 
counterintelligence activities of the Japanese, North Korean, 
and Chinese intelligence services in this region of Russia; the 
upcoming Federation Council discussions on Russian border 
issues; and to get acquainted with working conditions in 
regional FSK departments to find out how the Russian president's 
edict on combating organized crime and banditry will be 
implemented in practice. 
  According to the FSK director, the Chinese and North Korean 
intelligence services are actively recruiting people, and 
studying military technology and the drug business in the Far 
East territory. 
  Stepashin also said the document on joint action to 
implement 
the president's edict on combating organized crime will soon be 
signed with the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry. In the FSK 
director's opinion, this edict is very tough and even disagrees 
with some statutes of Russian law, but it is extremely necessary 
given current conditions. The document specifically permits not 
only lengthening the period of investigation, but also gives the 
right to legalize operational and technical information and hand 
it over to the court.

Il-song's Regime Increases Penetration Into Russia. Moscow 
Worried Over DPRK Special Services' Activity"; first two 
paragraphs published in a box] 
  [Excerpts] State Duma Deputy Vladimir Lukin told the 
public recently that Russia ought not to be guided by 
"ideological considerations" in relations with North Korea. He 
was thereby actually urging that it be treated almost the same 
as normal states. In the meantime, world community flare-ups 
with that country will obviously continue as long as the chuche 
idea has a state shape. This is a quite natural state of things. 
  Of course, the United States and the other countries shaping 
today's geostrategic balance cite rather sober arguments as the 
basis for a tough reaction to the North Korean threat. For 
example, a nuclear bomb in the hands of the irresponsible 
leaders of the chuche state is capable of scaring anyone. And 
if these leaders are bluffing, the very scale of the deception 
makes one believe that they are capable of unleashing a 
conventional war as well.

  Sergey Stepashin, head of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, stated at a press conference in

give an example, he recalled the deportation from Moscow of five 
North Korean citizens who tried to take out of the country what 
are called "components of nuclear arms production." [passage 
omitted] 
  Despite the fact that North Korea has long overstepped all 
the permitted limits, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
stated yesterday that international sanctions against the 
"nuclear blackmailers" from the DPRK "should be phased" and be 
regarded "as the last resort."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Andrey Bychkov and </F>
Andrey Kirillov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun (TASS) -- Talks between Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vo Van Kiet, the Prime Minister 
of the SRV Government, were concluded at noon today. 
Incidentally, the signing of the treaty on the basis of 
friendly relations between the two countries and other 
documents, which was expected immediately after the conclusion 
of talks, has been postponed until this evening. 
  Answering an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin stated that "in fact, there are no disagreements 
between us." Explaining the delay regarding the signing of 
Russian- Vietnamese documents, the head of the Russian 
Government noted that during a discussion "technicalities" 
arose, which require further work on the part of specialists. 
Thus, he added, the signing is being postponed until this 
evening. "We are convinced," Chernomyrdin stressed, "that we and 
Vietnam have all the possibilities and potential to increase 
traditional cooperation in the trade-economic, technical, 
scientific -- as well as other -- spheres". 
  For his part, Vo Van Kiet agreed with the assessment of the 
talks given by the Russian prime minister and added: "We need 
some time to better prepare these documents." 
  ITAR-TASS correspondents have learned from well-informed 
sources close to the Vietnamese delegation that disagreements in 
the position of the sides arose on the following issues: the 
problem of settling the debt of Vietnam to Russia, which the 
latter inherited from the former USSR, the conditions for the 
Russian Navy's use of the base of Cam Ranh, and a range of 
issues relating to Vietnamese citizens residing in Russia.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 15 June TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk has proposed making Vitaliy Masol, 66, Ukraine's new 
prime minister. A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Masol was 
the last head of the Ukrainian Government under communists. 
  Earlier he worked for 20 years at the Novokramatorsk 
machine-building plant, rising from assistant foreman to general 
director. He later worked on the state planning committee and 
headed the Ukrainian Government until October 1990 when he 
resigned in protest against the political and economic course 
approved by the then parliament under pressure from national 
democrats. 
  In the present parliament Vitaliy Masol has no party 
affiliation, although he says he remains "a communist at heart." 
The former premier has a good chance of regaining the post, 
because the communist majority in the parliament is expected to 
back his candidature. 
  Vitaliy Masol will present his programme to the parliament 
within the next few days.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at opening </F>
session of the Ukrainian Supreme Council in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed people's deputies. You will recall that 
when the Supreme Council session was opened in this chamber a 
preparatory working group submitted proposals and issues that 
were to be considered by the Supreme Council for the agenda. 
One of the first points after the organizational formation of 
the Supreme Council was the issue of the government. I also 
know that the overwhelming majority of deputies who announced 
their preelection programs also took into account the fact that 
one of the first actions of the Supreme Council of the new 
convocation would be the appointment of a prime minister and the 
formation of a government. It is completely fair that in the 
present situation it is necessary to have a government which is 
capable of conducting reforms, one that will take Ukraine out of 
the crisis and guarantee the stabilization, above all, of its 
economic development. 
  Taking into account that the Supreme Council of the present 
convocation has a functional structure and a party structure, 
that is, deputies' groups and groupings are present in it, I had 
a meeting with the Supreme Council Presidium and with members of 
groups and groupings at which candidates for the post of 
Ukraine's prime minister were proposed. They were discussed and 
analyzed during the meeting. The economic situation which our 
state finds itself in was also analyzed. Both the deputies' 
groups and the Supreme Council Presidium, with my participation, 
raised those issues which are constantly being raised both in 
the Supreme Council and in our society. These are: consistent 
implementation of economic reforms, [Ukraine's] emergence from 
the economic crisis, stabilization of the economy, and social 
protection of the population, particularly its most vulnerable 
sections. 
  Having such a structure in the Supreme Council, I submitted 
a 
proposal to debate in detail the candidacy, and, taking account 
of the present situation and the balance of forces in the 
Supreme Council, I propose Vitaliy Andriyovych Masol for the 
post of prime minister of Ukraine. I believe this nomination 
will be supported by the majority of people's deputies. This 
nomination is supported by some of the parliamentary groups and, 
as far as I understand, the majority of the Supreme Council's 
Presidium. Other candidates have been proposed, as you have 
been informed. But considering the situation, and knowing that 
other candidates do not have the support of a majority in the 
Supreme Council Presidium and the groups, I want to avoid 
putting these candidates in a position which could harm the 
appointment of the prime minister and mount political tension. 
I want to elect a prime minister in a constitutional manner 
without violating the procedure and the constitution. This is 
what I propose, and I would ask you to consider this.

<F P=106> [Speech by Deputy Vitaliy Masol at the Ukrainian Supreme </F>
Council following his nomination by President Leonid Kravchuk 
for the post of prime minister, in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed chairman, esteemed president, esteemed 
people's deputies: I would like first of all to extend my 
sincere appreciation to President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk for 
nominating me to the high and responsible post of Ukraine's 
prime minister. I am sincerely grateful to Supreme Council 
Chairman Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz for his support and to 
all the people's deputies who asked me long before my nomination 
as the proposed head of government to agree to this proposal. I 
hope that they intend to support me during the voting. 
  In agreeing to lead the government, if I am appointed today 
to do so, I am fully aware of the enormous responsibility placed 
on anyone making this decision during this difficult period that 
our young independent state is undergoing. I would like to 
assure you in all frankness that my intention and consent to 
take this important state office, if the nomination is 
successful, is not based on some personal ambition or selfish 
interest, but is based solely on an understandable desire to use 
my intelligence, my experience, and my skill to overcome the 
economic difficulties, improve the people's living standards, 
and strengthen our statehood. This was the main purpose for 
which our electors sent us to Ukraine's top legislative body in 
an expression of supreme confidence and perhaps their last hope. 
  You understand that each of the possible candidates for this 
post simply cannot today have a specific program of action for 
the future government. Such a document may be drawn up on the 
basis of an in-depth professional analysis of the state of the 
economy and the practical needs of our development with due 
account of proposals coming from the commissions and individual 
people's deputies. All members of the government who will be 
involved in the implementation of the program should take part 
in its preparation. 
  Taking this into account, let me only dwell on the key 
conceptual approaches and certain organizational and practical 
issues which in my opinion require urgent solutions, and set out 
my position, my views, on the most important sociopolitical 
problems facing our state. I believe I should also outline my 
ideas as to the principles of forming the new government and 
organizing its work. That is, of course, if you should trust me 
to head the government. 
  Esteemed deputies, my political orientation is based on the 
premise that Ukraine must continue to develop as an independent, 
law-governed, democratic state. Our common cause, regardless of 
party affiliation, must be a concern for the strengthening of 
Ukraine's sovereignty, preservation of its territorial 
integrity, and inviolability of its borders. This is the most 
important task for Ukraine's budding statehood. 
  Ukraine is a market economy, a state that cares for the 
social protection of its citizens. Ukraine means privatization. 
The economic crisis that we are going through has in the recent 
years enriched us with a considerable, though, unfortunately, 
mostly negative experience. To a great extent, it has become 
clearer what should not be done. We have come to realize 
particularly well that economic isolationism in all its forms 
and the breaking of economic ties with our age-old partners and 
neighbors were the main causes of the state's economic decline. 
  I am convinced that, while preserving its sovereignty and 
independence, Ukraine must, in its development, maintain good, 
equal, and friendly relations with all CIS countries, and above 
all, with Russia. Recognition of our national identity, our 
historic traditions, and our place in the world civilization 
must not lead us toward self-isolation and naive complacency. 
On the contrary, under certain conditions, it can become a 
reliable basis and a necessary condition for sovereign Ukraine's 
friendly relations with all peoples and nations, for our further 
coexistence and cooperation in an interrelated and 
interdependent world. Bearing the heavy burden of building 
Ukraine's statehood, we must at the same time accelerate the 
reforms in our economy and the transition to market relations, 
provide genuine safeguards for the proclaimed equality of 
different forms of ownership, and open the doors for 
enterprising, industrious, and bold people. 
  The monopolized economy has lately been hounded into a dead 
end; we need to find a way out of it as soon as possible. That 
should be done primarily by improving the health of state 
policy, increasing labor motivation, and halting the decline in 
production. Of course, this will take some time, something that 
we, unfortunately, of which we have almost run out. 
  I am profoundly convinced that, without implementing a 
program of wide-ranging support for entrepreneurship, 
particularly that which is evolving in the sphere of production 
and innovation, it will simply be impossible for us to carry out 
in-depth economic reforms in the very near future. Alongside 
forming various funds and centers to provide this support, 
including those with the participation of foreign investors, the 
government must introduce tax concessions for the 
entrepreneurial structures that are performing their activities 
in our state's priority spheres, such as agricultural growing 
and processing, construction and development in the construction 
industry, and the production of drugs and consumer goods. 
  A clear system of credit support, concessions in the 
provision of banking services, and commercial risk insurance 
should function here. I believe that the entrepreneurs working 
in industries of primary importance could be given wider 
opportunities in the use of facilities within the production 
infrastructure owned by the state. If we fail to do this, the 
development of economic reforms in Ukraine, as well as our 
entire economy, will for a long time remain in a state of 
decline and stagnation. 
  It is precisely this current situation that is well 
demonstrated by the results of the national economy's work in 
the five months of this year. The economy's performance, I 
would say, has been supernegative. What is more, contrary to 
(?pseudo-) optimistic statements being made publicly of late, 
the national economy's decline and crisis are constantly on the 
increase. 
  Out of considerations of an ethical and moral nature and for 
certain personal reasons, contrary to how things are very often 
done, I would not like to start analyzing the state of the 
economy by criticizing the previous government and quoting 
figures in order to confirm the rate of our speedy decline. I 
hope they are well known to you anyway. 
  Everyone of us, naturally, cannot help but ask the question: 
What can explain this agonizing state of our economy, and what 
are the main reasons for the steady rise in the tendency of 
decomposition, chaos, and disintegration that has been observed 
by us in the course of the last few years? I am absolutely 
certain that if we do not find the real causes of this and do 
not make the right diagnosis of our economy's prolonged disease, 
we shall not be able to find effective remedies for it. Nor 
shall we be able to take the right path to lead us out of the 
economic crisis in the shortest possible time. Anything other 
than that today not only has no future, but also poses an 
extreme threat to the fate of Ukraine. 
  Let me expound my reasons for saying this: I believe that 
the main reason is a lack of political will, courage, and a 
clear plan for reforming the economy, which are required and 
which for a long time now have not been found in our leadership 
structures; and the fact that we are constantly throwing 
ourselves from one economic program to another. For a long 
time, we trailed behind Gaydar's reforms and copied them, which 
led eventually to the stalling and blocking of important 
decisions. 
  I also believe that the catastrophic state of our economy 
can 
be explained not only by various power structures' tactical 
mistakes, but also, to a considerable extent, by a disregard for 
strategic macroeconomic thinking that could develop an 
acceptable model of Ukraine's national economy and determine the 
optimal means of moving toward curbing the crisis. Even if we 
were doing something at the microeconomic level, such as handing 
out credits, granting tax concessions, distributing hard 
currency, providing subsidies, and so on, almost no work was 
being done at the macroeconomic level. 
  I think that the budgetary and financial policy that has 
been 
pursued by our state for quite a long time now is not only 
politically, socially, and organizationally ill-considered, but 
also is fundamentally flawed and has effectively led to the 
collapse of the financial system. Although the emergency 
measures that have been taken lately to check inflationary 
processes have had some positive results, I still consider them 
temporary because they are based on erroneous principles and 
approaches. 
  Inflation today has simply been driven underground, and that 
has been done artificially. To a considerable degree, it is 
hidden, which was achieved by causing what I think is an equally 
distressing phenomenon: the artifically created absolute 
insolvency of most of our enterprises and essentially the whole 
of our population. The payment thrombus that has formed in our 
economy's financial arteries will ruin it utterly. 
  Can you tell me, please, who needed the budget without a 
deficit for 1994, contrived by (?the cabinet) and approved by 
the previous Supreme Council? Given the present state of our 
economy, it can be achieved only on paper. 
  By our ill-considered actions in the sphere of taxation, we 
have introduced, I will say openly, a wild system for taxing all 
subjects of economic management. If 22 percent of income is 
today being deducted from all enterprises, or more than 55 
percent of profits, then there cannot be any talk of 
entrepreneurship, particularly in the sphere of production. 
Such an ill-thought-out approach only causes profits to be 
concealed. It became the reason for the economic suppression of 
production and almost the complete suspension of Ukraine's 
investment process. 
  The government's shortsighted policy with regard to the 
so-called fixed regulated exchange rate of the dollar and the 
quite liberal manipulation of the hard currency legislation have 
led to the collapse of the domestic hard currency market. The 
concealment of hard-currency earning abroad is taking on an even 
larger dimension. According to IMF experts, hard currency 
receipts worth $1.3 billion were not returned to Ukraine in 
1993. That is, despite our difficulties in obtaining hard 
currency, last year we continued to invest our hard currency in 
production in Russia, European countries and generally anywhere 
so long as it is not here. Hard currency that remains abroad 
does not work for the benefit of Ukraine's economy. Life itself 
forces exporters to do this, for today it is the only way to 
somehow preserve the production of goods that are exported, 
because due to the high taxes and wild differences in exchange 
rates, Ukraine's export potential is being reduced everyday. 
  According to foreign experts, we lose around $100 million 
every month for these reasons. I consider that the government 
and the National Bank were not able to elaborate a clear 
monetary and credit doctrine, did not create a market of credit 
resources that was accessible to all, and took to this important 
affair in an amateurish way regardless of the fact that credits 
are one of the most powerful sources for the growth in the 
monetary mass. To a considerable extent, it was precisely 
because of this that today our karbovanets is no longer able to 
fulfill its main role as a means of accumulation and of 
financially guaranteeing investment and foreign economic 
activity. People do not trust, so to speak, our national 
currency and in conditions of crippling inflation have stopped 
saving their money in savings banks. Our money does not work 
for our economy. But you know that under market relations the 
most important thing is that money should work. 
  Esteemed colleagues, analyzing the state of affairs, one 
cannot help but ask oneself: Where is the way out? What is to 
be done in the first instance to rectify the situation? What 
are the main processes in our socioeconomic and spiritual 
revival? In the economic sphere, we must, first of all, work out 
a clear program of macroeconomic transformations, define their 
content, their stages, their speed and order, all of which would 
accord with a socially oriented model of market relations. Only 
on this basis will we be able to stop the destructive tendency 
toward the collapse of the country's productive forces and its 
intellectual and productive potential, and to minimize the 
social casualties of our reforms. 
  While giving the reforms a stronger impetus, the government 
must ensure state regulation of the economy, especially in 
strategic industries, which is being done in every 
market-oriented country. For us, these key sectors are power 
engineering, the coal, metal, and chemical industries. The 
state sector in this case would act as one of the players in 
market relations, while the state on the whole, without losing 
its administrative function, would have a greater influence on 
the regulation of economic processes. 
  But the situation that has emerged in the national economy 
today requires most radical and urgent measures of direct 
action, so to speak. First of all, it is necessary to launch as 
soon as possible the production of domestic goods at full 
capacity. This must be done using all possible stimulative 
factors that will encourage the manufacturer to produce the 
necessary goods that are affordable to most people. The main 
task today is not to collect enormous taxes and form an 
unrealistic budget, but to revive the economy as soon as 
possible by relieving the tax pressure, to allow labor 
collectives to work normally and allow people to receive what 
they have earned. 
  I would like to stress for deputies and for everybody else 
-- 
an earned salary and not one received through speculation in 
hard currency. If somebody today still has some hope that this 
can be done only by artificially speeding up payments between 
enterprises, by granting them more cheap credits to replenish 
their circulating resources, then I can assure them that these 
are illusionary expectations. The process of collapse and chaos 
has gone so far that a purely monetary approach can no longer 
change or rectify anything. I consider that we must now act not 
with traditional methods, but with those which at first glance 
seem almost paradoxical. It is necessary to change the entire 
philosophy and methodology of our state's financial and 
budgetary system. What is meant by this? 
  First of all, we must reject the pillaging principle of 
taxation, of collecting as much from taxpayers as possible, and 
to go over to the principle of leaving them with as much of the 
earned profit as possible. The policy of liberalizing taxation 
is fairly simple here: The more we leave for the taxpayer today, 
in the end, the more the state will receive tomorrow. I 
consider that the critical level of taxation from each 
enterprise should be about 15-17 percent of income -- but this 
is an issue for the future. Today, we should attempt to 
increase the profit part of the budget by increasing the level 
of production. At the moment, this is the main way of reducing 
taxation. 
  Second, while the state should support individual priority 
sectors of industry, we should nevertheless refuse to give 
subsidies to the majority of loss-making enterprises and 
organizations. As of today, they amount to about 25 percent of 
the total amount. We should finally understand that a 
philosophy based on supporting the weak, on enterprises that are 
incapable of working profitably, leads nowhere. On the 
contrary, brave, hard-working, and talented workers need every 
kind of support and encouragement at the state level. 
  Incidentally, bankruptcy, contrary to the understanding that 
is widespread in Ukraine, is, first of all, a financial and not 
a social concept. It does not mean that an enterprise will be 
liquidated without fail. Not at all. Simply that this factory 
or plant will experience a change in ownership. A new director 
will arrive and will make it profitable. In my view, already 
today some of these enterprises could be sold even to foreign 
investors, and not necessarily for a high price, but definitely 
with one firm demand: the new owner should invest as many 
resources in the production process that are required to ensure 
that the enterprise makes a profit and provides people with work. 
  Third, we need to define more clearly the priorities in 
deciding the most important economic problems. Among them, most 
attention should be paid to the development of the fuel and 
energy complex; power engineering, including atomic energy; and 
overcoming the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The 
government is obliged to develop and implement a long-term 
program of providing Ukraine with resources and critical imports 
-- first of all, oil and gas. 
  Today this problem, in my view, is usually being decided by 
the enthusiasm and personal possibilities of individual 
officials who, during periodic visits to Moscow after being 
warned in a threatening manner, succeed in asking for another 
round of credits or extract a postponement in payments and sink 
deeper into debt. They have already succeeded in selling off 
our national wealth. I consider that such a short-term policy 
is not only degrading for our state but is also generally 
extremely dangerous for our economic and state independence. 
You will agree that there is no bigger theat to us today than 
the $6 billion or or so that we owe mainly to Russia. 
  Esteemed people's deputies, I think you will agree that the 
former Supreme Council paid considerable attention to the 
development of the agro-industrial complex and the food 
processing industry and to solving the problems in these vital 
sectors. But in my opinion, these issues were separated from 
each other, there was no comprehensive approach and no strategic 
course was worked out toward resolving such complex issues as 
price parity between industrial and agricultural products; the 
form and size of the state procurement order; payment for 
farmers' products supplied to the state; as well as the tax, 
financial, and credit policy in the countryside. 
  No decision has been made as yet on land privatization. I 
believe that two approaches are possible. First, and this can 
be done in the near future, we can allow a 49-year lease of land 
for the construction of various social facilities. That will 
also be extended to foreign investors who can build hotels and 
everything else needed to develop our social sector. The second 
option is to make land available for lifelong use with the right 
of inheritance, but only to those who have worked in the 
countryside for a certain period and who have relevant 
experience and education to use the land efficiently. In this 
way, we will prevent speculation and the takeover of land by 
various rich dealers. 
  Undoubtedly, our electorate expect that the new Supreme 
Council will return to these problems in order to prepare 
concrete laws to boost the formation of a market economy and a 
viable market environment in the countryside. Flexible 
legislative work should demonopolize the food processing sector. 
I believe that it is due to the stalling of this process that 
food prices today are not free. I am sure that a comprehensive 
approach to these issues will allow us to create a reliable and 
efficient market mechanism to reduce food prices. It is 
extremely urgent today. 
  Esteemed colleagues, in the several days that our new 
Supreme 
Council has been in session, we have said a lot about the social 
protection of the population and the numerous complex issues 
that have cropped up and require immediate solutions. This is 
indeed so. In my opinion, the socioeconomic situation remains 
the most acute problem on which the government must focus its 
attention. The main task is to stop further decline in the 
people's living standards by means of resolute measures in 
pricing policy, and to search for opportunities for selective 
reduction of wholesale and retail prices for vital consumer 
products. I believe that the entire government policy must be 
based on the principle that rich citizens make a rich country. 
  While I stand firmly in favor of deep economic 
transformations in our society, I nevertheless emphatically 
disagree with those politicians who believe that before starting 
on a civilized road of development, we must wade through a 
swamp: economic and political degradation and drastic 
impoverishment of a considerable group of people who are denied 
reliable social protection, while an isolated group of slick 
dealers accumulate unseen wealth. I believe you will agree that 
we did not have to make people extremely poor and promise them 
that maybe some day they will become rich. It is time to 
realize that millions of poverty-stricken and faithless people 
will not create a rich and powerful state. 
  We all saw that for ourselves during numerous meetings with 
voters. We all remember how difficult it was to face 
reproachful questions from pensioners whose pension is not 
adequate to make ends meet. I do not know about you, but I was 
rather ashamed to face people who are living on pitiful minimum 
wages, especially educators, doctors, veterans of labor, members 
of large families, invalids, and other low-income groups of the 
population. Undoubtedly, all these issues require urgent 
discussion in parliament and practical actions on the part of 
the government to resolve them as soon as possible. 
  But to be frank, as a human being, I was most amazed by the 
horrible state of our humanitarian sector, first of all, 
science, health care, and education, especially in rural areas 
and areas affected by the Chernobyl disaster. We must do our 
best to improve the environmental situation in the state. I 
think, with all our differences and economic troubles, we will 
have no excuse if we do not break the standstill in these areas 
by means of relevant legislative acts. We are obliged to regain 
lost prestige in these sectors as soon as possible and give the 
people hope for an improvement in the situation, because the 
health of our people, their future intellectual potential, and 
our priceless possession, the nation's gene pool, in every sense 
depends on our ability to resolve these problems. 
  I am convinced that the country's government must pay more 
attention to the implementation of the program for the 
conversion of the military-industrial complex, problems existing 
in our army, its financial provision, and social protection of 
the military. You will agree that the Army's efficiency, 
reputation, and the respect it commands in society depend to a 
great extent on the way we manage to remove the existing 
difficulties and the way we care for our servicemen. I hope 
that all of us, irrespective to which political party we belong, 
will act in a like-minded fashion on these issues and will make 
mutual concessions to resolve them as soon as possible. 
  Another problem of overall state importance which has come 
to the fore and requires the Supreme Council's urgent 
intervention is the fight against crime, especially organized 
crime, bribery, corruption, and widespread economic criminal 
activity. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the criminal 
web is spreading a thick layer over our entire young, fledgling 
state. What are the proposed priority measures to be taken by 
the government and the Supreme Council? First of all, I believe 
that we need to strive for unity and consistency in the actions 
of law enforcement bodies and improve our penal legislation, 
which is clearly lagging behind in the crime marathon; and this 
is not least through the fault of the top legislative body, 
which was very slow in passing all the additions and amendments 
to the laws proposed in recent years. 
  Finally, I believe we need to considerably reduce budget 
expenditures for the state apparatus; revise the size of staff 
in our ministries, departments, and state committees; and adjust 
their functions to keep up with market conditions and the 
demands of the present time. We must be bolder in the 
transition from the sectoral to the functional management 
principle; quicker in renouncing interference in every detail of 
the work of enterprises, in renouncing sheer administrative 
control, authoritarianism, and pressure on production units. 
The structure and mechanism of executive power must fully 
accord with the deep transformations taking place in the 
economy, the society, and the state. 
  On the basis of the results of local elections which are 
soon 
to be held, we must work out and pass legislation on the concept 
of regional economic management and build a flexible and strong 
vertical structure of executive power. We must consider and 
introduce strict accountability of all these structures, from 
the Cabinet of Ministers to the village council. I also believe 
it very important that the key posts in state administration 
should be held by highly professional, competent people, with 
sufficient hands-on experience in management at the relevant 
level, trained for state leadership, who will take resolute and 
principled actions on the basis of their rights and the laws, 
will not be afraid to take bold decisions, and will be ready to 
bear responsibility for the results of their activities. If I 
am elected to the post of prime minister, I will be prepared to 
assist the appointment to government and other leadership 
positions of young and talented specialists, reformers in 
spirit, with sufficient hands-on experience in the sphere of 
management, and train them to be top-level leaders, irrespective 
of their political views. 
  Esteemed people's deputies, our internal economic policy is 
tied closely with our state's external economic and diplomatic 
activities and the fulfilment of its obligations to the world 
business community. I believe that the future government must 
continue active and balanced cooperation with international 
financial organizations. Ukraine's membership in the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help create 
favorable conditions for the implementation of our internal 
economic policy and our plans to reform the economy. Apart from 
this, active membership in these reputable institutions entitles 
us to participate in decision-making with regard to 
international financial policies and opens access to economic 
information. 
  I would also like to support the main principles and 
guidelines for the development of Ukraine's economy in the 
period of crisis set out by Oleksandr Oleksandrovych Moroz. In 
conclusion, I would like to stress once again that I have 
outlined here the main essential, conceptual points of the 
economic program that I will pursue, defend, and implement if I 
am elected prime minister. I would like to particularly stress 
that it can only be fulfilled by joint efforts of both branches 
of power, with your understanding, and with the Supreme 
Council's support of our state's new government, which in its 
work will be guided by the Cabinet of Ministers law, which is 
among the first that needs to be discussed and passed. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 16 June TASS -- Secret voting is to be held in 
the Ukrainian parliament on Thursday [16 June] on the 
endorsement of Vitaliy Masol's appointment as Ukrainian prime 
minister. The parliament adopted this decision on Wednesday 
after a programme statement by the candidate to the post of 
prime minister. 
  Masol, specifically, said he believes "Ukraine must continue 
developing as an independent democratic rule-of-law state. The 
strengthening of its sovereignity and preservation of 
territorial integrity should be common concern". Masol believes 
"Ukraine needs equal and friendly relations with countries of 
the CIS and above all with Russia in order to preserve its own 
independence". 
  Masol holds that to overcome the crisis it is necessary to 
step up the pace of economic reform, transfer to market 
relations and ensure equality of all forms of property. The 
government should ease taxation on entrepreneurial structures 
engaged in production and processing of farm produce, in the 
construction industry and in communal services. 
  Masol believes that support by credits, banking services on 
easy terms and ensurance against commercial risks should be 
offered to these areas. He said that the main purpose now is 
not to levy exorbitant taxes and drawing up an unrealistic basis 
but to ease taxation and envigorate the economy, enabling work 
collectives to work calmly and people to receive their earnings. 
Masol believes taxes should not exceed 17 percent of profits. 
  He said there are two approaches to land privatisation. Land 
can be rented for the construction of various social facilities 
for 49 years, also to foreign investors, or else land can be 
offered for long-term use with the right of inheritance. 
  Masol expressed the conviction that it takes the effort of 
all branches of power to solve all problems.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk intends to visit 
Crimea and, in particular, those regions of the peninsula which 
have suffered from the drought. 
  At a press conference held on his return from Luxembourg on 
Tuesday, Kravchuk reported that during this trip he intends to 
determine the scale of the aid which Kiev would render to Crimea. 
  Speaking about the present conflict between Kiev and 
Simferopol, Kravchuk said that Crimea would be gradually 
introduced into Ukraine's "constitutional regime" by means of 
reasonable compromises but not by force. 
  Kravchuk said there would be no coercive measures with 
respect to Crimea in the future and stressed that "Ukraine will 
never overstep this threshold and will not allow anybody to do 
this." 
  Kravchuk underlined that in accordance with the treaty on 
partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and European Union 
signed by him on Tuesday in Luxembourg, the European Union 
expresses its support to Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
sovereignty. 
  "Europe recognizes that this is a factor of European 
stability," Kravchuk said.

  [Text] Reporting from Simferopol in the Crimea, 
correspondent Vladimir Plotnikov said the Crimean Supreme Soviet 
today formed a new delegation for talks with Ukraine. The talks 
are to concentrate on "reaching cohesion between the 
legislations of the Crimea and Ukraine." 
  After the first round of these negotiations the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet severely criticized its own delegation for making 
too many unilateral concessions. "They demanded that the 
composition of the working group should be reviewed, and so 
today the new composition was approved. The criterion for 
inclusion was Crimean patriotism. Only those deputies who had 
voted for the restoration of the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 
1992 were included in the group." 
  The working group has been instructed to be guided by the 
1992 Constitution, and to "proceed from the idea that in the 
process of delimitation of rights and duties between Ukraine and 
the autonomous republic, the Crimea is of it own accord 
delegating some powers to Ukraine." These are very tough 
instructions, Plotnikov said, especially since Ukraine insists 
on the revocation of the 1992 Crimean Constitution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Draft Agreement Is Ready"] </F>
  [Text] On Friday night [10 June], a delegation of the 
Crimean parliament handed a draft agreement between Ukraine and 
the Crimea to the Ukrainian side. The negotiations between 
representatives of the sides within the framework of the 
interparliamentary Ukrainian-Crimean working group were 
completed in Simferopol. 
  As the agency INTERFAX-UKRAYINA was informed by the head of 
the Crimean delegation and representative of the parliamentary 
Commission for Legislation and Law Enforcement, Sergey Nikulin, 
the draft consists of three parts: Powers that the Crimea hands 
over to Ukraine; powers that Ukraine may hand over to the 
Crimea; and joint powers. However, he did not specify the 
content of those parts. 
  According to S. Nikulin, during the scheduled round of talks 
"the sides did not even try to discuss those articles of the 
Crimean Constitution that did not suit Ukraine." The Crimean 
delegation, he said, stated directly and unambiguously: There 
will be no revision of the Crimean Constitution. 
  The working group believes that just the first stage has 
been 
completed and insists that work be continued.

  [Text] Commander of the Ukrainian Navy Volodymyr 
Bezkorovaynyy accused the Black Sea Fleet commanders of removing 
property from the garrisons, which are to belong to Ukraine. He 
told INTERFAX-Ukraine on Wednesday [15 June] that the Black Sea 
Fleet commanders hoped to make the property of the Black Sea 
Fleet Russia's property. 
  "The removal of the property will inflict direct damage on 
the economic interests of Ukraine," said Bezkorovaynyy. 
  In his opinion, this question must be discussed during the 
next round of the Ukrainian-Russian talks on the division of the 
Black Sea Fleet. 
  He also announced that the headquarters of the Ukrainian 
Navy 
were considering the parameters of the Russian fleet's temporary 
stay in Sevastopol. 
  He said that the discussion of the division of the logistics 
property continued.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 15 June TASS -- A strong and authoritative 
power capable of making decisions and answering for their 
consequences is necessary for Ukraine to get out of crisis. 
"Nobody in the world has ever survived a crisis without a strong 
authority," said Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian presidential 
candidate, in a national radio broadcast on Wednesday. 
  If I am elected Ukrainian president, I will be ready to 
assume full responsibility for the state of things in the 
country, Kuchma emphasized. 
  "Ukraine needs to take a new political course which should 
be 
aimed at rejecting self-isolation, at restoring all mutually 
beneficial economic, spiritual and cultural ties with the former 
Soviet republics, and first of all with Russia," he said. 
  "Ukraine should be open to cooperation with the rest of the 
world, and only then state-of-the-art Western technologies will 
come here -- and application of these technologies holds the 
country's future," he added. 
  Kuchma, who is now a leader of the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, promised that his first move 
in the position of Ukrainian president would be "to form a 
united economic area with all the CIS countries." 
  At that rate, he will also "strive for Ukraine's full 
membership in the economic union," declare for reaching an 
agreement on hard currency and customs regulations based on 
equal rights among the CIS countries and for an urgent 
elimination of fixed karbovanets-US dollar exchange rate. 
  According to Kuchma, he will "strive for granting Russian an 
official status, while Ukrainian will retain its state-language 
status." 
  "I have never and nowhere risen the issue of restoring the 
Soviet Union. But I will do my utmost to develop good 
neighbourly relations with all those countries with which we 
have traditional historic, economic and cultural ties. I have 
always opposed building an independent state based on 
anti-Russian sentiments," he said. 
  In his opinion, land should not be sold or purchased, 
whereas 
public medical and education services should be free of charge. 
  "I would like to realize the plans which they stopped me 
from 
realizing in 1993," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Petro Talanchuk, </F>
Ukraine's education minister, by A. Polishchuk: "The Ukrainian 
People Must Wake Up"] 
  [Excerpt] Petro Talanchuk is a man well known in Ukraine 
as the rector of the Kiev Engineering College, deputy of the 
former Soviet Supreme Council, and current minister of 
education. He won public recognition and popularity during the 
late 1980's perestroyka. Elected to the USSR Supreme Soviet, 
Talanchuk assumed a clear democratic standpoint and supported 
sovereignty and independence of our then Soviet Republic. Soon 
afterward, he actively espoused revival of the Ukrainian 
national democratic movement. Having become the minister of 
education, he has proved to be an energetic leader with a 
comprehensive program for reforming the educational system. He 
is 56 years old; an engineer, doctor of technical sciences and 
professor, and the president of the Academy of Engineering 
Sciences of Ukraine. He has three children and four 
grandchildren. Professor Talanchuk is a well-educated man with 
broad views and willpower. He has his own way of seeing our 
country's way out of the current crisis. His earnest smile and 
peasant-like sturdy figure call forth sympathy. Such people are 
described "as strong as a wall." Would Ukraine survive if it 
leaned on him? Consider this for yourself. 
  [Polishchuk] By European and world standards, Ukraine is a 
large state. It is a prestigious and responsible matter to be 
its president. We are going to the polls, but we do not yet 
know who will be leading the state -- the president, the 
parliament, or the government. Their powers are not 
constitutionally defined. Petro Mykhaylovych, what do you think 
is the optimum way to resolve this problem? 
  [Talanchuk] Today, the most precious thing for us is time, 
and we must not waste it. Elections must be held, and the man 
who is elected will actually encounter misunderstandings. I 
would like to believe that, no matter who becomes the president, 
he will manage to come to terms with the Supreme Council, and to 
constructively resolve these problems, to resolve them quickly, 
because we no longer stand in one place -- we have started to 
fall down. Just as we need air, we need to step up reforms. I 
believe that we can do it best with a presidential form of 
administration. 
  [Polishchuk] You are talking about stepping up reforms. As 
a matter of fact, all we have is an economic decline, as in a 
tunnel, in which one can see no light. Why in Poland or the 
Baltics the reforms are moving forward, but we seem to be 
hampered? Is this our Ukrainian peculiarity -- "the inability 
to build a state"? 
  [Talanchuk] This is a difficult question. As you know, 
Dovzhenko [famous Ukrainian film director and writer] said: 
"Regarding great causes, we are nasty people." As I understand 
it, he had in mind our national consciousness. This is quite 
objective. Why is that so? 
  Each society develops successfully if it has even a narrow 
layer of innovative people. These are people who think 
unconventionally, unusual personalities. They can be found in 
the rural areas, among the workers, engineers, and the 
intelligentsia. 
  Let us recall our history. The majority of talented people 
were persecuted and exterminated. What impact did the 1933 
famine and the 1941-45 war have on the Ukrainian people? I read 
in LITERATURNA UKRAYINA about writers who were tortured to death 
and I think: "Good Lord, how many!" Our national elite was 
systematically exterminated. 
  While I was arguing with Americans over our difficulties, 
and 
I saw them swagger around, I told them: "I would like to see 
how your country would have looked if someone had done to you 
what was done to us." This argument baffled them. 
  Nevertheless, the Ukrainian people must wake up. We have 
wise people, and together, we are able to develop any 
socioeconomic model. If we agree, we will only have to act, 
implement, and not panic. This is a paradox: God gave us good 
crops last year, we harvested them, and now... we are talking 
about famine. Can anybody think of anything more horrible? 
  [Polishchuk] Petro Mykhaylovych, how do you see the 
mechanism for market reforms in line with the social, though 
illusive, guarantees, to which we were accustomed to under the 
Soviet authorities? 
  [Talanchuk] Currently, although it is impossible to draw a 
complete picture of our future state, I can see its outlines. 
There will be a mix of both planned and market economies, 
because if someone claims that he will jump into the market 
economy tomorrow, I do not believe him. This is unrealistic. 
The level of our people's culture is very low, including legal 
and production culture. It should be improved by 
command-administrative methods as well. People have to be nudged 
into doing good, because they do not know what that means. 
  The Supreme Council and the president should coordinate 
their 
actions, assuming that everything that is good for the people 
must be developed and supported. When we finally create decent 
conditions for work, an able-bodied society will be able to 
protect itself, its children, students, and our pensioners, who 
gave us wealth -- a potential to which we hold on. 
  I do not rule out state support for certain categories of 
people. But it is nonsense to speak about welfare for all. We 
have already bombarded the people with delusive promises such 
that they are already choking. It is time to abandon social 
demagogy. 
  [Polishchuk] There are currently many discussions about 
Ukraine's territorial-administrative system. What is your 
standpoint? 
  [Talanchuk] Based on our historic experience, I support a 
unitarian state, until we become accustomed to each other. We 
should introduce a Day of National Accord, in order to abandon 
the division into followers of Melnyk or Bandera [nationalist 
leaders during WWII], or communists, to raise common monuments, 
and to constructively look to the future. It is inadmissible to 
divide the country. Let us remember: History has given Ukraine 
a last chance to establish a state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Two cubic meters of water continue to leak every 
hour from a storage facility in the second power unit of the 
Chernobyl station, its chief engineer Viktor Vasilchenko told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  The leakage from the storage of processed nuclear fuel was 
detected on 11 June. 
  Vasilchenko said the leakage resulted from the way storage 
facilities of this kind had been installed. 
  Vasilchenko also said that the heating elements would be 
removed from the storage before Friday and the source of leakage 
would be found soon after. He thought that even if the storage 
facility was destroyed, nothing serious would happen. 
  Alexander Yelchishchev, chief of a shift in the station, had 
told INTERFAX-Ukraine that radiation in neighboring premises was 
normal.

Mykhaylo Melnyk in Kiev on 10 June: "The Radiation Situation Is 
Normal"] 
  [Text] An insignificant increase in the technological leak 
of contaminated water from the reservoir where used-fuel 
cassettes are stored was recorded at the Chernobyl Atomic 
Electric Power Plant [AES]. This was stated by Serhiy 
Nazarenko, chief of the emergency and control administration of 
Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy. According to him, 
the controlled system of drainage of technological waters, 
preventing their escape into the environment, guarantees the 
reliable accumulation of contaminated waters and their 
processing. At present, the radiation situation at the 
Chernobyl AES is normal, he assured.

<F P=106> [Two unattributed reports: "A Leak Has Been Revealed at the </F>
Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant"] 
  [Text] On 7 June, a water leak from the second power 
unit's decay tank, where cassettes with used-up fuel are stored, 
was revealed at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant [AES]. 
Head of the Chernobyl AES shift Oleksandr Yelchyshchev informed 
the INTERFAX-UKRAINE Agency that the leak amounts to two cubic 
meters per hour. He pointed out that this has not led to a 
change in the radiation situation in adjacent buildings. 
  According to him, the water leak does not constitute any 
special danger. O. Yelchyshchev also stressed that such 
incidents are "a disease of all atomic plants of this type." 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  As reported yesterday [14 June] by Ukraine's State Committee 
for Atomic Supervision, at the second power unit of the 
Chernobyl AES, beside the main system for adding water to the 
decay tank, where there were 480 cassettes, three additional 
ones have been prepared. Collection and purification of water 
that percolates through walls and ceilings of several chambers 
adjacent to the decay tank have been organized. The 
radioactivity of this water is about 1.0 microcurie per liter. 
It is mainly due to the presence of cesium. 
  A program has been elaborated for locating the leak, and 
work 
is based upon that program. In particular, 420 nuclear 
cassettes have been taken out of the tank.

  [Text] Ukrainian MP's who are members of the country's 
Officers' Union will insist that Ukraine stay nuclear if the 
Crimean parliament does not align the Crimean legislation with 
the Ukrainian laws. Vyacheslav Belous, the union chairman, made 
this statement in Kiev Wednesday. 
  Kiev wants Crimea to rescind the original wording of its 6 
May 1992 Constitution that calls for a treaty-based 
relationships between Crimea and Ukraine and enables the Crimean 
residents to have dual citizenship. 
  Belous said that his organization would support Leonid 
Kravchuk in the 26 June elections. 
  The Officers' Union, he said, opposes the attempts that 
anti-state forces inside and outside the Supreme Soviet mount to 
eliminate or disable the presidency in Ukraine. It regards the 
president as the guarantor of the country's unity and 
independence. 
  The Ukrainian Officers' Union has a membership of about 
10,000.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Kostyantyn Morozov, UKRAYINSKA </F>
HAZETA military columnist: "We Had and Still Have Security 
Guarantees in Our Hands. The Crimean Tension in Relations With 
Russia Is a Consequence of Ukraine's Nonnuclear and Nonaligned 
Status"] 
  [Text] From the first days of its existence as a state, 
Ukraine has been resolving the so-called Crimean problem on a 
daily basis. Even before the world felt this, it was already 
known in Ukraine that the Crimean issue would perhaps be a 
decisive one in the political relations between Ukraine and 
Russia. Due to the irresponsible steps taken by the Simferopol 
leadership, which adopted the course toward secession from 
Ukraine and rapprochement with Russia, especially at the 
beginning of May [1994], the world finally perceived a threat to 
peace in Ukraine, and in Europe, in these relations. Ukraine 
must now determine its attitude toward these issues. The 
history of the problem took shape right before our own eyes, and 
everybody remembers it. No matter how bitter one might feel 
about it, our Ukrainian mistakes and indecisiveness are largely 
responsible for the intensification of Russia's influence over 
the Black Sea Fleet and, through it, in Sevastopol and the 
entire peninsula. 
  In January 1992, the fleet commander [Admiral Kasatonov], 
who 
clearly occupied anti-Ukrainian positions, was not removed from 
his post. His presence in Sevastopol made it impossible for 
officers of the fleet to adopt a stand with regard to loyalty to 
Ukraine. Still, by the end of March 1992, the majority of the 
officer corps anticipated Ukraine's governmental decisions 
regarding the subordination to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. 
  Both the Ukrainian president and the government realized 
that 
special conditions for shaping public opinion in Sevastopol (the 
majority of its residents are former sailors and their families 
that arrived there from other Russian fleets; a great number of 
enterprises there depend upon the fleet; there are social 
problems for families of veterans and servicemen) also required 
special approaches, in contrast to the situation with the 
subordination of three military districts in Ukraine. 
  In April 1992, there was yet another attempt to subordinate 
the fleet to Ukraine. However, again, due to its 
indecisiveness, the government did not go beyond the creation of 
a parallel structure (the headquarters of the Naval Forces). 
Unfortunately, the headquarters was immediately discredited and 
its influence upon Black Sea Fleet officers who were supporters 
of Ukraine was insignificant. 
  Fearing complications, Kuchma's government even cancelled 
the 
decisions -- first steps of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense -- in 
the organization of the Black Sea Fleet financing through our 
Naval Forces. However, even then everybody understood that, 
soon, there would be even more problems. That was exactly what 
happened. 
  The unsuccessful provocative officers assembly held in 
Moscow 
at the beginning of 1992 demonstrated that, in Ukraine, the 
majority of officers had made up their minds. That is why 
efforts were concentrated mainly on the fleet. 
  As far back as in May 1992, active work, with the help of 
certain Russian forces, began in the fleet. The work was aimed 
at strengthening anti-Ukrainian sentiment among officers. The 
first step involved a considerable increase in personnel 
salaries. The activity of the officers' assembly resumed and an 
assembly coordination council was created. Active 
politicization of the officers' corps began. The 
intensification of Russia's influence on the Black Sea Fleet 
proceeded "on a legal basis" after signing the Yalta accord 
(August 1992). Since that time, the fleet, subordinated to the 
two presidents, has been taken away from the control of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, and the fleet activity of 
Russia's Ministry of Defense and the main staff of Russia's 
Naval Fleet was practically legalized. 
  Russia, implementing its financial expansion in the Crimea, 
artificially created for itself a priority in providing for the 
fleet. 
  At the same time, assistance to Sevastopol civilians (the 
majority of them are former servicemen) in the creation of 
public organizations and political parties of anti-Ukrainian 
orientation intensified. 
  A combination of intentions on the part of those parties and 
politicized officers over 1992-93 led to an intensification of 
anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Sevastopol and on the peninsula. 
  This situation was repeatedly discussed by a corresponding 
Supreme Council Commission, by the Defense Ministry's board, and 
by Ukraine's Security Council. Unfortunately, the commission 
was incapable of giving a proper evaluation of the events, the 
Defense Ministry's decisions did not find the government's 
support, and the Security Council took into account the position 
of the Crimean leadership. Both Bagrov, then chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, and Yermakov, then presidential 
representative in Sevastopol, did everything to hamper any of 
our initiatives and intimidated the government and President 
Leonid Kravchuk by claiming that "it would lead to an explosion 
in the Crimea." 
  That was precisely the reason for the July 1993 decision to 
suspend the formation in Sevastopol of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces Marines subdivisions. 
  Today, all of this is attributed to the president's 
indecisiveness. I find it necessary to throw light on the 
situation and include everybody. In the majority of cases, the 
president remained unassisted in looking for decisions that 
would not lead to an armed conflict. 
  Such a situation prevailed until the meeting in Massandra: 
The Supreme Council did not adopt decisions, and the government 
(of both Fokin and Kuchma) dealt with no military problems 
whatsoever. In the two years that I held the ministerial post, 
the military issue was discussed only once (in November 1991, 
the legislative bill "On Ukraine's Armed Forces"). 
  Under those conditions, Russia's influence on the Crimean 
problem intensified to the extent that virtually unprecedented 
territorial claimed were made upon Ukraine (the Russian Supreme 
Council decree of 9 July 1993 on the status of the Ukrainian 
city of Sevastopol) and pressure was put on it at the 
negotiations (Massandra, 3 September 1993). 
  We heard a lot about Ukraine's position with regard to the 
presidential elections in the Crimea, but no significant 
decisions have been adopted by Ukraine's Supreme Council nor 
actions by the government. Crimean separatists took advantage 
of the crisis situation in the country and, instead of looking 
for ways to overcome it, started manipulating it. The political 
forces and now also the leadership, artificially creating an 
impression that the Crimean population has the worst standard of 
living and deceiving the people, are, in fact, satisfying their 
own ambitions. 
  More than once I heard about an ethnic source of Ukrainian 
tension. Few people even in Ukraine speak of the political 
aspect of the tension or its artificial nature. In this 
context, the assessment of the situation by chairman of 
Ukraine's Security Service Yevhen Marchuk (KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI 
of 26 May 1994) seems to be not only authentic and patriotic, 
but also timely: "...the whipping up of panic among the 
population, the intimidation of the Crimean leadership, the 
shaping of an enemy image (naturally personified by Kiev), the 
selfless assistance by experts, the commissioning of groups for 
propaganda support, and many other things...." I agree with 
Yevhen Marchuk's conclusion to the effect that all of this will 
have a counter effect, against the Russian plans to split 
Ukraine, and that this force "...will become a consolidating one 
for Ukraine." 
  All of this has been said about our Ukraine -- our own 
fathers' home. External forces are shaking it loose, and we 
must rescue it and not moan that life is bad under these 
conditions. 
  Ukraine is an active participant in the European and world 
political process, which is establishing peace and harmony among 
countries. Many, if not all acts in this process tend to unite 
us with Russia. However, today, neither Ukraine's membership in 
the CIS nor bilateral interstate agreements guarantee security 
for Ukraine. 
  The fact that the program "Partnership for Peace" does not 
unite us with Russia is a serious warning. Russia is seeking a 
priority status in its relations with NATO. The formula "16 
Plus One" suits Russia better. It is clear to everybody that 
this bargaining is not to Ukraine's advantage. Perhaps we are 
expecting guarantees for our security in vain, or maybe those 
guarantees are still in our hands? 
  Why don't we also do some bargaining, now that Russia does 
not restrict itself by obligations to politically guarantee 
Ukraine's security? If, after the withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons, Ukraine becomes an arena for armed conflicts, maybe it 
is now time to halt the transfer of warheads and adopt a state 
program for political and technical measures to maintain them on 
our own? 
  At any rate, this will strengthen the Ukrainian position at 
the negotiations. 
  It is becoming obvious already that Ukraine's nonaligned 
status does not guarantee its security or noninterference into 
its affairs by other states. We see how Russia is increasingly 
exacerbating the Crimean problem in Ukraine. 
  Perhaps we should revise our striving for nonalignment and 
neutrality? Maybe a declaration of our intentions to gain 
membership of NATO would better guarantee Ukraine's security at 
least in the future? At any rate, it might strengthen our 
position at the negotiations. The United States must be invited 
as an intermediary and an authoritative monitor of the 
fulfillment of the accords. 
  In April 1994, the Ukrainian Academy of Original Ideas 
supported my initiative on the creation of an independent Center 
for Strategic Studies of Military and Political Problems in the 
National and Regional Security. On 28 May, the Ukrainian World 
Coordination Council, at its meeting, approved the idea and the 
draft concept of the center and thereby okayed the creation of a 
special nongovernmental fund. 
  I believe that the issues raised by me urgently require an 
independent investigation. The conclusions of such a 
investigation, in the case of the creation of the center at an 
advisory level, might be used by state structures for promoting 
Ukraine's interests. 
  The Russian Federation is our geopolitical neighbor, an 
ethnic homeland to large numbers of our citizens, and our 
potential genuine friend and brother. It is our strong desire 
that it be realized by it that not only Ukraine, but also Russia 
are "doomed" to maintain and strengthen this friendship by all 
possible means. Once again referring to the chairman of 
Ukraine's Security Service, I want to support his important 
conclusion: "There will be no split of Ukraine. We are not the 
Caucasus or Yugoslavia."

  An appeal to the Ukrainian Supreme Council was prepared at

the Ukrainian president and especially at the defense minister. 
Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy was reproached for the decline 
of combat readiness and discipline, the increase in the number 
of military crimes, and for the unprecedented increase in the 
number of generals and "showcase" exercises, all of which had no 
parallels in the Soviet period.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Kozin: "Petr Symonenko: 'Privatization Will </F>
Be Halted'"] 
  [Text] A meeting of journalists was held in Donetsk 
Saturday with V. Chuprun, a candidate for the post of head of 
the oblast soviet and the present chairman of the oblast soviet 
of people's deputies. Seats next to him in the presidium were 
occupied by P. Symonenko, first secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine [CPU]; A. Kiyashko, 
acting chairman of the political council of the Socialist Party 
[SPU]; and A. Gurbych, chief of the Donetsk Oblast press 
administration. 
  "The soviet must have executive authority." 
  "The reason for soviet authority is to reflect the interests 
of the people." 
  "The main figure is the working person, and not the 
speculator." 
  "We have had enough destruction." 
  "If a professor becomes a janitor or departs, this is a 
failure of the state." 
  "Land must not be turned into a commodity. Land must be 
state property." 
  "Physicians now receive a wage at a level that is lower than 
required for biological survival..." 
  That which we had occasion to hear at the meeting was rather 
predictable. The press of the whole world knows that staunch 
communists are enemies of healthy (and unhealthy, in their 
understanding) sensations; therefore, the measures that they 
organize always proceed smoothly and sensibly. There was no 
personal criticism of the contenders in the preelection 
campaign. There was a criticism of ideas that were alien to 
communists, there was criticism of the policy of the top 
leadership, and there was talk that someone, somewhere, was 
"passing" something to someone and interfering with normal 
living. 
  A substantial part of the questions was addressed to Petr 
Symonenko, CPU leader. Speaking about the results of the 
elections to the Supreme Council, he noted that there were 
numerically enough left-wing forces in parliament to block any 
antipopular law or decision. It is impossible now to disregard 
a party for whose representatives more than 10 million persons 
voted. However, it is impossible to claim that a victory was 
won and that authority was gained. As an example, P. Symonenko 
cited these figures: "Thirteen out of the 23 permanent 
commissions of the Supreme Council are headed by representatives 
of right-wing forces." The first secretary of the CPU Central 
Committee shared the anxiety of a number of journalists about 
the increase in the threat coming from extremists of 
ultranationalist organizations, he talked about this with the 
current president, and he reported to those assembled that this 
question will be raised sharply in the future. The journalists 
received information that the coal industry is now at the level 
of 1954, and that 56 percent of the GNP is the production of the 
agro- industrial complex... 
  P. Symonenko was asked: In the event that the CPU is 
successful in the elections to the local councils, do you plan 
to undertake efforts to change the pace and character of 
privatization? This was the answer: Privatization has an 
antipopular character. An analysis of it will be made. 
Privatization will be halted. 
  The journalists also heard from the conference participants 
that it was difficult for the Communists and their left-wing 
comrades to get through with a word of truth on the republic's 
television screens. The parliamentary newspaper GOLOS UKRAINY 
deals with the life of the regions in a way that is unbalanced 
and not objective. But the situation will be corrected, inasmuch 
as the Supreme Council commission on the legislative guarantee 
of freedom of speech and the mass media is now headed by V. 
Ponedylko, a decent person and a member of the CPU from 
Zaporozhye. 
  The two-hour meeting ended in a didactic way. The presidium 
called on "comrade journalists" to summon the citizens of the 
oblast to come to the ballot boxes on 28 June, for the local 
elections have far more than just local significance. 
  Besides the great and selfless love of the people, perhaps 
it 
is only this summons that is common in the positions of all 
participants in the election skirmish, from both the right and 
the left. However, this division in Ukraine is very conditional 
and is different from the main civilized world. In fact, none 
of those who are "from the right" are above us. There are 
right-leftists, left-leftists, and extreme leftists, and those 
for whom statehood is above all things. However, it seems that 
this has no bearing on the subject of the meeting that was held, 
and since this is the case, let us all vote!

<F P=106> [Article by L.M. Zaytseva, Crimean finance minister: "On </F>
Currency Regulation in Crimea"] 
  [Text] The Crimean president's edict, "On Currency 
Regulation and Currency Control," which actually does contradict 
Ukrainian legislation in terms of a number of positions, evoked 
an ambiguous reaction from official Kiev. In this connection 
many of our readers are interested in why the Crimean president 
was forced almost to enter into a certain confrontation with the 
leadership of Ukraine over this issue. 
  The factors that brought about the appearance of this 
presidential edict are explained by Crimean Finance Minister 
L.M. Zaytseva. 
  The fact is, says Lyudmila Mikhaylovna, that as a result of 
the establishment by the Ukrainian Government of a fixed rate 
for the karbovanets many enterprises of Crimea that have foreign 
partners, including Russians, were placed on the brink of 
financial disaster. For example, a critical situation developed 
with airline tickets in the Simferopol airport, where mostly 
Russian air carriers are based. 
  They were prohibited from selling airline tickets for 
Russian 
rubles and the sales were transacted for karbovantsy at the 
reduced exchange rate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Security. At 
the same time it was impossible to buy rubles at the low 
exchange rate and return them to their legitimate owners. But 
the aircraft still continued to fly, taking a loss. Even though 
in December the Crimean Council of Ministers adopted a 
resolution concerning the sale of airline tickets for Russian 
rubles, the situation has not improved, because Russian rubles 
were still subject to mandatory sale at the same reduced 
exchange rate. 
  In general, the exchange rate fixed below market turned out 
to be an extremely favorable environment for destroying domestic 
producers who were still capable of competing on the world 
market. At the dawn of Ukrainian independence there was not a 
single politician who did not emphasize that Ukrainian industry 
exports products to more than 100 countries of the world; now, 
to be sure, they try not to recall the times of the past Union, 
when this really was the case. Exports from Russian industry 
have fallen severalfold as well. 
  Crimea has ended up in an especially difficult situation. As 
a result of certain events it has lost the Russian market and 
has gained nothing except the karbovanets. In Ukraine only a 
small part of the commodity output finds its way to the world 
market, and the exchange rate of the karbovanets has been 
scandalously reduced. In addition to all that, they immediately 
permitted foreign economic activity without creating favorable 
conditions on the world market through intergovernmental 
agreements. And when domestic money began to rapidly lose its 
value, there appeared the idea of introducing a compulsory 
exchange rate below market for the dollar, but this was a 
struggle with an effect rather than a cause. 
  As a result the enterprises, in order not to be ruined, were 
forced to conceal foreign currency, and the already poor budget 
became even slimmer. Yet the exchange rates of the world 
currencies are changing every day. This means that our economy 
is being artificially slowed down, while on the market it is 
necessary to seize the moment. 
  But any currency is a commodity, and it is necessary to 
handle the commodity in one's own way and carefully, and the 
edict of the president of Crimea lays the foundation for this 
civilized attitude toward the Republic's main commodity. In the 
first place, currency revenues should be transferred to one's 
own republic and not left in foreign banks where they will 
circulate in the interests of anybody except Crimea and, in the 
second place, the earnings will be sold not at a fixed rate, but 
on the interbank currency exchange formed by the government. 
Even now there are branches of 85 Ukrainian banks operating in 
Ukraine and there can be no doubt that at the first signs of 
political stabilization and the formation of a civilized 
currency system dozens of Russian and non-Russian banks will 
come here. Bankers are well-to-do people and they can afford a 
good climate and peace. In any case, hope is inspired by the 
fact that Ukraine itself (which previously declared that 
Crimea's currency innovations were unacceptable) is following 
the Crimean path and preparing a package of documents providing 
for normal currency regulation. 
  Naturally, the creation of a foreign currency system worthy 
of Crimea is not a simple matter and we must not limit ourselves 
to the presidential decree alone. From the enterprises we are 
already receiving more letters with proposals to simplify the 
currency regulation system. On the other hand, certain Crimean 
companies will have to seriously revise their foreign economic 
activity and reorient it in the interests of Crimea. There is 
no other way.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 24, 6-12 June </F>
94] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Government has earmarked about 40 
billion krb. [karbovantsi] for survey and prospecting in 1994 of 
what might prove to be promising to exploit Ukraine's gold and 
silver deposits. 
  As Vladimir Tishchenko, the planning department 
superintendent of the State Committee for geology and mineral 
deposit utilization, disclosed in an interview to UKRINFORM's 
correspondent, 23 billion krb. have been allotted this year for 
specialized machinery and equipment to be installed in 
silver-and gold fields. Five pilot mines are supposed to be 
thus equipped in three regions after preliminary surveys, which 
allow to estimate their real silver and gold contents. The 
State Committee for Geology and Mineral Deposit Utilization is 
contemplating to channel 2.5 trillion krb., starting with 1994, 
to setting up and equipment of such pilot mines in the 
Dnepropetrovsk region (East Ukraine). 
  As experts with the State Committee maintain, the above 
stated sums will be sufficient for only the initial phase of the 
survey and prospecting project. However, there is hardly any 
need for more money pending the survey's results. 
  According to Mr. Tishchenko, it would be too premature and 
groundless now to conjecture the fields' warranted 
industrial-scale exploitation, since more or less conclusive 
evidence may be gathered not earlier than in 1996. 
  As preliminary survey data suggest, the Donetsk region's 
gold 
sulfide and silver Bobrinskoe and Zhuravskoe deposits appear to 
be most accessible in the Nagolny ridge (see UBN no. 17/1994). 
  The project also provides for surveys in virtually all 
regions of Ukraine, where precious metal deposits were found 
(Ukraine's Transcarpathia, Dnepropetrovsk and Kirovograd 
regions, and the Nagolny ridge). 
  The State Committee's Yuzhukrgeologia (South Ukrainian 
Geology), Severukrgeologia (North Ukrainian Geology) and 
Karpatukrgeologia (Carpathian Ukrainian Geology) agencies are in 
charge of survey in their respective regions of Ukraine. 
  In the meantime, Mr. Tishchenko cautions that the early 
survey's promising results need more substantiation before a 
feasibility study could be launched. Laymen's emotional 
optimism should be considered as irrelevant, for the time being, 
Mr. Tishchenko maintains.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on 
measures to combat banditry and organised crime. 
  "The state should have a single economic space and single 
legislation. The purpose is on that basis to tap the unique 
potentialities of each part of Russia," the newspaper quotes 
President Boris Yeltsin as saying at a meeting with the Tuva 
leadership during his three-day working tour of Blagoveschensk, 
Kyzyl and Novosibirsk. The tour ended on Thursday. 
  The newspaper carries an interview with police Major-General 
Gennadiy Chebotaryov, first deputy head of the Russian Interior 
Ministry's main department for action to combat organised crime. 
He comments on President Yeltsin's decree on the protection of 
the population from banditry and other manifestations of 
organised crime. 
  Chebotaryov said considerable resources have been brought 
into use of late to combat organised crime. Following the 
presidential decree, this work will be stepped up, he said, 
giving Interior Ministry data that the number of organised 
criminal groups in the country has increased from 785 in 1990 to 
5,600 by now. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, in an article headlined "a cavalry 
attack on crime. The State Duma prepares a tougher law on 
action to combat organised crime than is provided for in 
President Yeltsin's decree", points out that a bill to this 
effect envisages rather long prison terms ranging from three to 
thirty years. 
  In another article, the newspaper points out that "Russia 
will not be able to bust crime until all legal foundations of a 
democratic state are restored..." 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA quotes Leonid Cheshinsky, president of 
the 
federal Roskhlebproduct Bakery Product Contract Corporation, as 
saying tht "Russia will not buy grain abroad this year". 
However, he believes, bread prices will go up in the middle or 
end of summer as a consequence, primarily, of the purchases of 
grain in the country on credit at bank discount rates. The 
prices of bread will grow by 20 percent a month on average, he 
said. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs an interview with Boris Nemtsov, 
governor of Nizhny Novgorod and member of the Federation 
Council, who believes that in agriculture "the key task for the 
government, the president, the State Duma and the Federation 
Council is to carry out a land reform on a voluntary basis". 
  "If the principle of voluntary participation is observed to 
the end, a land reform will last ten-fifteen years in Nizhny 
Novgorod and in Russia", Nemtsov maintains. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR), in an article headlined "the 
state promised to protect us reliably from disasters. Is this 
task practicable?", writes about last year's growth of the 
number of breakdowns connected with discharges of toxic and 
radioactive substances into the atmosphere. 
  There were 1,180 emergency situations in Russia last year, 
with 10,133 people affected and 1,224 of them killed. The 
newspaper runs excerpts from this year's May governemnt 
resolution "On the protection of the life and health of the 
population of the Russian Federation in the event of an outbreak 
and elimination of the aftermath of emergency situations caused 
by natural calamities, industrial breakdowns and disasters". 
The resolution provides for the establishment of an all-Russia 
service for the provision of medical aid in the event of 
disasters. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Admiral Vladimir 
Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet. Now that Lithuania and 
Byelorussia have become independent states and the territorial 
isolation of Kalinigrad region from the rest of Russia has 
become a reality, "it is urgently necessary to have a logistical 
base for stockpiling and the preparation of reserves on Russia's 
main territory. The Baltic Fleet will play precisely such a 
role of the Navy's logistical base," Yegorov said. 
  TRUD interviewed State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin who believes 
that Russia has now already passed the "point of no return" with 
regard to her totalitarian 70-years-long past, notwithstanding 
by-effects and losses. "There is only one road now -- to a 
civilised future worthy of her people", Rybkin said. 
  In KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, Valentin Stepanov, head of the main 
directorate for space rocket technology of the Russian State 
Committee on the Defence Industry, describes the problems of 
Russian aid to North Korea in the development of its nuclear 
programme and how a mass departure of Russian missile technology 
researchers and their families to that country at the end of 
1991 was prevented. 
  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA raises the subject of growing unemployment 
in Russia, tracing how funds exacted from people in the form of 
two- percent insurance tariff are being used. The newspaper 
notes contradictions in jobless accounting methods which do not 
reflect an actual situation, and the lack of a federal 
employment programme up to now. 
  PRAVDA maintains that the number of strikes staged in the 
first quarter of this year in Russia, including those in 
Siberian regions, was larger than in the entire 1993. 
  In view of the threat of unemployment and mounting 
discontent 
of Siberian workers, regional trade union organisations have 
dissociated themselves from the treaty on social accord, the 
newspaper writes.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Feofanov: "Emergency Measures To Fight </F>
Crime Could Turn Into Arbitrary Action by Authorities"] 
  [Text] In all probability the Russian Federation 
president's Edict of 14 June "On Urgent Measures To Protect the 
Population From Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of 
Organized Crime" will get the approval of working people. For 
some reason I think that, had the edict talked of shooting 
gangsters on the spot without a trial or investigation, the 
approval would have been even more hearty. 
  True, the following question will remain open: Is it always 
the gangster who gets shot? 
  The state is entitled to take any number of strict measures 
to protect its citizens and public order from crime. In the 
United States they do not balk at sentencing minors to death. 
But over there a judge will free the most hardened criminal if 
the police violated the prescribed procedures when arresting 
him: If they entered an apartment without a warrant, bugged a 
telephone without authorization, or arrested and questioned him 
without an attorney. They are well aware that justice consists 
of procedures. 
  The president's edict does not correspond, to put it mildly, 
very much to these principles and norms. The craftiness of this 
act, equal in force to a law, is that it erodes the procedural 
guarantees which at least nominally guarantee our rights and 
freedoms. 
  We often hear and read that criminal proceedings have been 
instituted in a case or against a specific person suspected of a 
crime. Only after this are investigatory actions possible: 
seizures, searches, the confiscation of documents, detention, 
etc. Even justified suspicions must be procedurally recorded. 
This gives a citizen a guarantee from arbitrary action by 
administrative authority. By instituting criminal proceedings, 
by officially making accusation, the authorities put a person 
under the law's protection and give him the opportunity to 
resort to judicial control. The president's edict overturns all 
these guarantees. Of course, this is very convenient for the 
administrative authorities. In fact, an investigation can go on 
before criminal proceedings have been instituted. In the edict 
clear requirements of a procedural nature have been replaced by 
the empty words "by agreement with the prosecutor." 
  Yes, our business is to a considerable extent criminal; yes, 
many businessmen are associated with gangland and other criminal 
groupings. But there is also honest business. The edict hands 
it over to the full arbitrariness of repressive organs, which 
for some reason we call law-enforcement organs. Henceforth, 
under a law-enforcement official's directive it will be possible 
to violate a commercial secret, a secret regarding deposits, and 
the privileged nature of banking and financial documents -- that 
is, everything which forms the basis of business. But is there 
confidence that the intrusion into business will be dictated by 
the interests of the fight against crime and not by a bribe from 
competing structures? Given the total corruptness of the 
apparatus? And then...how will the market be affected? Because 
it cannot get along with a repressive regime. 
  Section 3, Article 1 of the edict is particularly confusing. 
It is worded with a fair dose of jesuitic craftiness. The crux 
of the matter is that people suspected of crimes who are going 
to be punished not under the criminal law but under this edict 
can be immediately arrested (detained) for 30 days. In the 
document the word "arrest" is neatly avoided: "a written 
undertaking not to leave, personal recognizance, recognizance of 
public associations, or a bond are not applicable." Of all the 
measures to secure a defendant's appearance, prison for a month 
is all that is left. Incidentally, the General Prosecutor's 
Office has been instructed to establish "constant oversight of 
the observance of legislation when this edict is being 
implemented." I wonder how it will be possible to exercise this 
oversight if one thing contradicts another? The document says 
nothing about an attorney's participation in the "edict 
procedure." Does it follow from this that his functions have 
been completely excluded? If so preliminary investigators and 
investigators are completely free to do as they please.... 
  About 20 years ago the CPSU Central Committee, protecting 
the 
population from hooligans, also issued a directive authorizing 
arrest on the spot; at that time we wrote, thrilled by the 
authorities' decisiveness: "Let the ground burn under the feet 
of criminals." Now this has been repeated word for word by our 
capital's mayor. If we count back about 50-60 years we get to 
other laws and edicts: "Ten years apiece for gleaning ears of 
grain, into the dock for being late for work. 
  I repeat again. It is not the law's severity which is 
terrible. It is the rejection of law that is terrible. Of 
procedural law above all. Stalin's mass repressions began with 
the simplification of the judicial procedure for certain 
categories of cases, then trials were eliminated altogether, 
being replaced by two-man tribunals, three-man tribunals, and 
lists.... 
  I am very frightened by the surge in gangland and any other 
crime; it has indeed exceeded all bounds. Yet the most terrible 
thing is legalized arbitrary action by the state. Here there 
cannot be any protection for anyone. We have already 
experienced this but we are trying to forget the experience, as 
though people in our country have not been tried under edicts 
which have supplanted laws, and under laws which have supplanted 
justice. If a gangster can be taken away without a trial and 
investigation today, they will surely come after an honest man 
tomorrow. There are no exceptions to this rule.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Aid Program"] </F>
  [Text] Russian President Yeltsin is apparently to 
promulgate, before the end of June, a program of aid to Russians 
living in the states of "near-abroad." This is expected to take 
place during an official meeting in the Kremlin with 
representatives of power structures and public associations, 
Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the commission on questions of 
citizenship under the Russian Federation president, has 
announced. The program, he said, would incorporate three edicts 
already drafted by the commission he heads. The principal edict 
is entitled "On the Concept of Russian Federation Policy in 
Regard to Fellow Countrymen Living Abroad." Mr. Mikitayev 
pointed out that a package of documents on a mechanism of 
putting the edicts into effect will be up for approval. The 
government is completing work on this package. The draft law 
"On the Concept," according to A. Mikitayev, proclaims Russia's 
initiative to formalize at an interstate level measures that 
would guarantee the observance of the rights of nonindigenous 
populations permanently resident in new independent states. The 
two other draft edicts envisage specific aid to retired 
servicemen resident in the Baltic states.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vice Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays by </F>
unidentified correspondent on the "Topical Interview" program in 
Moscow; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The words freedom, property, 
legality are written on the party's banner. 
  [Anatoliy Chubays] These words epitomize the essence of what 
the party sees as a goal for Russia as a whole and what the 
party has to offer as Russian values. [ passage omitted on 
Chubays expanding on the importance of the above concepts] 
  [Correspondent] Anatoliy Borisovich, the party has changed 
its name from Russia's Choice to Russia's Democratic Choice.... 
  [Chubays, interrupting] Yes, there were long and heated 
debates about the name. As a result, I believe a very correct 
version was chosen. Many people said that we should not do that 
because the word democratic had lost its attractiveness, and 
many people did not respond to it any longer. But I agree with 
those who argued that we should not try to recruit supporters 
from among those who are not our supporters. We have a position 
and a policy and our own view of things which we offer to anyone 
who is ready to listen to it. Yes, we support the democratic 
choice. We supported it when it was popular and continue to do 
so after it has lost its popularity, perhaps. Generally 
speaking, a true politician should not seek popularity, but 
popularity should find its politician, the one who does not 
change his position even in difficult conditions. That is why 
the new name Russia's Democratic Choice appeared. 
  [Correspondent] Upon whom do you rely most? 
  [Chubays] A report at the party congress [held 12-13 June] 
was devoted to just this question. We were told about a 
large-scale sociological study of those who voted for the 
Russia's Choice, that is, those upon whom we rely. What 
transpired was that if a general image of supporters of the 
Russia's Choice were drawn, it would show an educated person, 
though not necessarily a doctor or candidate of sciences. It 
could be a well-trained worker, or engineering and technical 
personnel, aged 25 to 45-50, as a rule. This person understands 
that the country and the economy are in a difficult situation; 
nevertheless, he does not think that everything has collapsed 
catastrophically, that life is over, and that the only thing to 
do is to commit suicide. This person is inclined to believe in 
himself, in his own capabilities, and has certain grounds for 
this, like education, positive thinking, and so on. In other 
words, this is the strata that has saved Russia and our economy 
through its work. So this sociological study we were told about 
is very encouraging. It shows that the party relies upon the 
people to whom the future belongs. 
  [Correspondent] Why should a vice premier, who has problems 
up to his ears, want to deal with party affairs? 
  [Chubays] I will not hide that I was a little sceptical, 
especially looking at our numerous parties, which are 
mushrooming and disappearing without having really changed 
anything. I will tell you frankly that the congress itself, the 
people who gathered and the serious, substantial, and committed 
way the congress' real work was done had a very strong effect on 
me. There were fears that it could turn into some kind of 
democratic tea party, with senseless discussions of procedural 
matters, like why Article Five or Six of the Charter uses a 
comma instead of an and or why this wording was chosen over 
another. However, it turned out that the overwhelming majority 
of the people who gathered at the congress and who devoted 
themselves to the cause are people who understand very well what 
is really important and significant, people who are ready to 
devote themselves to this work. Being fully aware that, on the 
whole, this work is unlikely to be a bed of roses, and many can 
even expect to be hurt because many of them have difficult 
relations with local authorities, people came, nevertheless, and 
people are and will be working. They have already had the 
experience of last October and March 1993 and many other events 
which they have lived through in Russia where they work and 
live. Looking at these people, one understands that this is not 
empty talk, not a ticket to an ego trip, but a real cause which 
requires real strength and work. That is why I worked, work 
now, and will continue this work despite all my government 
duties. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think a breakthrough will come 
and in what shape? When will the country see a better life? 
  [Chubays] Naturally we discussed this issue. I must say, 
though, that the congress discussed such noneconomic issues as 
military reform, relations with CIS countries, the 
countryside--a lot of attention was paid to this. As regards 
your question, there is the following view: If the policy that 
is being implemented in Russia today, the government's and the 
president's policy, retains a reformist component of the kind 
represented by the latest package of presidential decrees, 
experts from the Russia's Choice believe that there is quite a 
real possibility that 1994 can become a year of stabilization 
and 1995 can become a year when the Russian economy starts 
overcoming the crisis. 
  [Correspondent] What other steps should be taken to make 
reforms irreversible and then to bring if not prosperity then at 
least a certain amount of well being the shortest possible way? 
  [Chubays] A lot has to be done. First, the legislative base 
of reforms is still very inadequate, that is, the very word, 
legality, we mentioned earlier. Today, unfortunately, the 
largest part of economic foundation is made up of presidential 
edicts, not laws. After six months of work the Duma can 
scarcely credit itself with any major legislative decisions. 
But this is very important because law is a kind of stable 
long-term foundation on which stable economic relations, stable 
investments, and so on can be built. 
  [Correspondent] Does the president support you? 
  [Chubays] One must mention that Yegor Gaydar has discussed 
with the president more than once our work within the framework 
of Russia's Choice. The president supports our activity, and 
the party supports a reformist president, something that was 
stated officially at a news conference. I am convinced that if 
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is a candidate in the 1996 
presidential elections, Russia's Democratic Choice will be a 
party which will unequivocally support Yeltsin's candidature. 
  [Correspondent] Are you going to nominate a candidate of 
your 
own? 
  [Chubays] But Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is our candidate.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Borodulin in the "Russian Government </F>
Session" column incorporating commentary by the economic policy 
department: "The Premier Has Called on the Government to Work 
with Its Head, Not Its Feet"] 
  [Text] A feature of yesterday's session of the Russian 
Government was its extremely jittery atmosphere. Calls from 
some ministers to keep calm gave way to apocalyptic predictions 
by others. At times presentations turned into a bitter 
squabble. Meanwhile the premier, who had just returned from 
leave, appealed to his subordinates to put first the interests 
of Russia, not their departments. Government "back-benchers" -- 
apparatus officers -- tired by the stuffiness of an overcrowded 
room, did not particularly try to fight off an overpowering 
drowsiness. 
  The reason for this situation, generally uncharacteristic of 
the Viktor Chernomyrdin cabinet, was the issue discussed at the 
session. Putting aside all other items on the agenda, the 
participants concentrated on summing up the results of the first 
half-year. Strictly speaking, there was no particular need for a 
report by First Deputy Economics Minister Yakov Urinson: 
Exactly a week ago the government examined the economic 
situation. However, having returned from his leave, the premier 
decided to familiarize himself with the situation. 
  According to Urinson, the industrial recession has reached 
26 
percent in the first six months of this year, nearly halving 
compared to 1991. An analysis of the decline pattern done by 
the Economics Ministry for the first time is noteworthy. 
Ministry experts attributed 35 percent of this slump to cuts in 
military spending; another 15 percent, to cuts in budget 
investments; 10 percent is linked to falling demand for oil in 
the CIS countries (caused by high prices), and 10 percent is due 
to declining effective demand among the Russian population. The 
remaining 30 percent has been caused "by the effects of market 
mechanisms, poor adaptability among enterprise managers, and the 
breakdown of economic links." 
  The gist of the conclusions made by ministry experts is 
this: 
A basically new economic situation has emerged in Russia. Its 
signs include the weakening of nonmarket factors and the effects 
of demand constraints, which has brought about a sales crisis. 
Urinson stopped short of calling this state depression. 
  There is no particular point in recounting the content of 
subsequent reports by sector ministers: a standard (with rare 
exceptions) set of excuses and a minimum of sensible 
propositions. Viktor Chernomyrdin's reaction to these 
presentations surprised even the veterans of the government 
apparatus. One of them recalled Aleksey Kosygin, usually a very 
discreet premier in the USSR Government, who yelled at his 
subordinates only once: When he lost patience with immoderate 
sectoral claims by then ministers and their total disregard for 
state interests. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin yesterday chose a similar vocabulary and 
tonality. "We shall not give anything to anyone for free"; 
"ministries must reflect the interests of the entire state, not 
just of their own enterprises"; and "we will not be bossed 
around by anybody" are quite happy expressions of gratitude to 
the president for his determination "not to ditch Chernomyrdin." 
  The premier also reacted to the president's criticism of the 
government's performance. "Well, enough is enough; we shall not 
put up with this any more" and "I shall have enough political 
will for everything" -- these words are apparently to be one of 
the last warnings to the sluggish intermediary government level. 
True, weekly public sermons to subordinates have now been 
practiced for more than a month. 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  The draft presidential edict "On Amendments to the Russian 
Federation President's 23 May 1994 Edict No. 1004 On Certain 
Questions of Tax Policy", moved by the Russian Social Insurance 
Fund for government consideration, was taken off the agenda at 
the very beginning of the session. The draft envisioned 
revoking instructions to the government to submit to the State 
Duma a draft law on reducing the rate of payments to the social 
insurance fund to 3.6 percent from 5.4 percent. Apparently, 
serious substantiation will be needed to encourage the president 
to cancel one of his proposals to alleviate the tax burden. So 
far the fund's case boils down to a shortage of funds: Revenues 
in the second half will fall by 2 trillion rubles, as a result 
of which the fund will not have enough money to pay even the 
benefits stipulated by the law. True, temporary disability 
allowances, for example, are paid out of the fund's money held 
in enterprise accounts. If the fund's figures are correct, this 
will primarily affect the poor, who get their benefits through 
social security bodies, which is promises an aggravation of 
social tension. 
  The fact that the draft edict was taken off the agenda does 
not mean anything: Even if the government insists on reducing 
the rate, the same can hardly be expected from the State Duma. 
  Meanwhile, unless the Duma remembers, in the very near 
future, about the need to establish a new rate for contributions 
to nonbudget funds (or extend the old one), beginning with 1 
July they may not be paid at all. 
<H5>  Main macroeconomic indicators in the first half of 1994 </H5>
  Gross domestic product in current prices will total 248 
trillion rubles. At constant prices GDP will fall by 18 percent 
compared to the same period last year. 
  The volume of industrial output will decline by 26 percent 
compared to the first half of 1993. 
  Exports will grow by 3.6 percent, reaching $20 billion. 
Imports will grow by 18 percent to approximately $15 billion. 
The balance of trade will be $5 billion (a fall of 24 percent). 
  The exhange rate of the national currency will fall by 60 
percent compared to December 1993, exceeding 2,000 rubles per 
$1. The purchasing power of the ruble, compared to the dollar, 
will increase by 18 percent. 
  Real estimated monetary incomes will grow by 14 percent. 
  The number of officially registered unemployed is estimated 
at 1.4 million, which is 0.6 million people more than at the 
beginning of the year.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Aleksandr Shashkov] </F>
  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, opening 
today's Russian government session, was strict as usual. He 
began by removing two questions from the agenda since Cabinet 
members had not had time to acquaint themselves with them, and 
by recognizing as correct the criticism of the government 
expressed by the president at a news conference. 
  The report by the deputy minister of economics on the 
preliminary results of the first six months of this year 
bristled with figures. On the basis of them, Yakov Urinson drew 
the conclusion that the government program for stabilizing the 
situation in the economy is beginning to bring real positive 
results, and that any talk of the collapse of the economy or of 
it being on the brink of collapse is groundless. 
  Without denying the claims of the Economics Ministry, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin nevertheless cast doubt on the figures on which 
they are based. As it turned out, statistics today follow the 
imprecision of the statistics of the Soviet Union, with the 
difference that if previously the indices received by the State 
Committee for Statistics were exaggerated in the name of the 
transient red banner, then now they are underestimated in order 
to avoid taxes, which also confirms the movement of the economy 
toward market relations.

Banks Ask for Respite"] 
  [Text] The Association of Russian Banks [ARB], in the 
person of its president Mr. Yegorov, at a news briefing 
yesterday, asked their foreign partners to call a moratorium on 
their activities in Russia until 1 January 1996, the date 
determined by the presidential edict of 23 November 1993. This 
request is motivated by the inability of 75 percent of newly 
formed Russian commercial banks to compete owing mainly to the 
generally low qualification of their staffs. At the same time 
Mr. Yegorov noted the need for all-out support for banks with 
mixed capital. The ARB president made his statement in the 
presence of the heads of Moscow City's major banks "Stolichnyy," 
"Menatep," and "Mostbank."

Improving the Work of the Russian Federation Banking System"] 
  [Text] With a view to curbing inflation and enhancing the 
efficiency of the work of the banking system and protecting bank 
investors' interests I decree: 
  1. That it be recommended to the Central Bank of the Russian

credit institutions, ensuring that comprehensive checks on their 
activity are carried out at least once every two years; 
  --in conjunction with interested organizations elaborate 
within three months and submit to the Russian Federation 
Government proposals for the development of consumer credit. 
  2. That to ensure the protection of the savings of Russian 
Federation citizens, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 
accelerate the creation of the federal fund for insuring the 
assets of Russian Federation banking institutions which attract 
the money of Russian Federation citizens. 
  It must be established that in cases envisaged by Russian 
Federation legislation the safekeeping of deposits can be 
guaranteed by the state using money from the federal fund for 
insuring the assets of Russian Federation banking institutions 
which attract the money of Russian Federation citizens. 
  3. That the Central Bank of the Russian Federation ensure 
that its representatives and auditors take part in the work of 
liquidation commissions when liquidating commercial banks, 
including for insolvency (bankruptcy). 
  4. That it be deemed expedient to continue until the 
adoption of new banking legislation to ensure the mutual 
representation of the Russian Federation Government and the 
Central Bank of the Russian Federation with a view to

  5. That it be deemed intolerable for the organs of state 
power of the Russian Federation components to adopt legislative 
acts and carry out actions which violate the unity of the 
Central Bank of the Russian Federation's system, proceeding from 
the premise that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is a 
federal bank and the regulation of its activity in accordance 
with the Russian Federation Constitution comes within the 
exclusive competence of the federal organs of state power. 
  6. That it be established that the restrictions envisaged by 
point 1 of the Russian Federation president's 17 November 1993 
Edict No. 1924 "On the Activity of Foreign Banks and Joint Banks

Russian Federation Territory" do not extend to: operations with 
people who are residents under Russian Federation legislation 
indicated in licenses issued by the Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation before publication of this edict to foreign banks and 
joint banks with the participation of funds belonging to 
nonresidents; or with banks established on Russian Federation 
territory which are from countries in the Russian Federation's 
relations with whom agreements on the encouragement and 
protection of capital investments that have come into force are 
applied. 
  That there shall be agreement with the Central Bank of the 
Russian Federation's proposal for the issue of licenses for the 
improvement of banking operations for foreign banks and joint 
banks with the participation of funds belonging to nonresidents 
on Russian Federation territory on condition that the relevant 
states observe the principle of reciprocity with regard to 
Russian banks which open branches, offices, daughter companies, 
and joint institutions abroad. 
  7. That this edict enters into force from the moment it is 
published.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Lantsman under the "Reform" rubric: </F>
"Machine Builders Press for Pro-Inflation Measures To Save Them 
From Structural Reform"] 
  [Text] According to the forecasts of the Russian 
Federation Government Working Center for Economic Reforms, the 
tendency for inflation to stabilize at 8 percent of GDP will 
persist no longer than 1.5 or 2 months. In midsummer the 
government is "sure to take a series of pro-inflation measures 
to rescue the country's machine building industry." This was 
announced by Sergey Pavlenko, head of the Working Center, at a 
press conference at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel. 
  In addition to the supposed government measures, some other 
factors too point to increased inflation, Pavlenko said. For 
example, cash emission went up by a factor of 2.5 or 3 in April. 
Nevertheless, the three-month financial stabilization yielded 
indisputably positive results. First and foremost it gave the 
population an opportunity to adapt to economic change. A normal 
reaction by citizens can be seen in the growing sums in savings 
accounts, control of which is confidently switching from the 
Russian Federation Savings Bank to commercial banks (the Savings 
Bank share has fallen to 50 percent). The population's trust in 
the government's financial policy can also be seen, according to 
Mr. Pavlenko, in the lower proportion of hard currency savings. 
According to Sergey Vasilyev's [as published] forecast, if the 
existing draft budget is adopted for implementation the 
population will continue to have faith in the financial policy 
of the state and the future inflationary surge will not exceed 
the 10 percent of GDP ceiling planned for the year's end. 
  Assessing the aftermath of the production crisis in Russia, 
Mr. Pavlenko pointed out that, despite the psychological shock 
the government experienced at the absolute figures for the 
production decline in January, the crisis reflects what is now a 
definite pattern -- a decrease at the start of the year, some 
recovery of production in May through June, another decline in 
the fall, and a rise toward the year's end. Today, according to 
the Working Center, there is a slight recovery in the fuel and 
energy complex, in ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, and in 
some sectors geared to the consumer market. The steady negative 
indicators in machine building are natural and point to the need 
for structural reform. The important thing, the Working Center 
experts think, is for Chernomyrdin's cabinet not to panic. 
  Analyzing the current state of the Russian economy, 
Professor 
Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, who is in 
charge of a group of foreign advisers at the Working Center, 
pointed out that the main problem with the state budget is 
insufficient tax revenue. Budget revenue in the first quarter 
of the current year was 36 percent of the planned level. 
Assessing the real consumption figures, Mr. Layard said there 
is insufficient official information. According to the method 
used by the State Committee for Statistics (real incomes minus 
real savings), social consumption has grown 11 percent. If you 
rely on the results of a households study, the figure will be 18 
percent in the first quarter of the year. 
  Analyzing the labor market, Mr. Layard stated that Russia 
has 
discovered a unique method of regulating unemployment. Open 
unemployment has not grown more than 1 percent this year. The 
main levers to regulate it are the great differentiation of 
wages in various sectors and methods of latent unemployment 
(enforced vacations and shorter workweeks). In the first 
quarter shorter workdays affected 2 percent of people in 
employment, and enforced vacations affected 4.4 percent. As 
little as 1.5 percent were affected by personnel reductions out 
of 25 percent of the total number employed in production. 
During the same period, the number of people hired for jobs 
amounted to 21 percent of number already in employment. For the 
time being enterprises are managing to preserve jobs by cutting 
wages. But this tendency, Mr. Layard thinks, will not last 
long. Then open unemployment will grow, but it will be lower 
than in the Eastern European countries, the English professor 
hopes.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Burbyga incorporating interview with </F>
Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of Russian Armed 
Forces General Staff; place and date not given: "So Just How 
Big Is Russia's Military?"] 
  [Text] According to Defense Ministry data appearing in the 
press, the Russian Army now has 2 million men. On 15 June, 
however, during a meeting with the leaders of Amur Oblast, 
President B. Yeltsin gave a different figure. Speaking about 
the reform of the Army, he declared that its strategic goal is a 
reduction from 3 million to 1.5 million men. 
  So just how many men are serving in the Russian Army, and 
what is its authorized strength? In order to answer these 
questions, we turned to the Ministry of Defense for an 
explanation. 
  It turned out that the ministry itself had not prepared or 
passed to the president any data on the size of the Armed Forces 
during these days. In the opinion of the military, the 
discrepancy in the figures which the president has now given and 
which the Defense Ministry has announced at various times arose 
because account is not always taken, when talking of the Army's 
quantitative composition, of the fact that numerical strength is 
subdivided into authorized strength (the number of posts 
provided for by the prescribed strength level) and actual 
strength (the number of servicemen actually fulfilling duties). 
At the same time the authorized and actual strengths change 
constantly. For example, as of 1 May 1992 the prescribed 
strength level stood at 2.8 million servicemen, and the roster 
at just over 2 million. The difference between the prescribed 
strength level and the actual strength constituted the degree of 
undermanning. 
  In the opinion of Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief 
of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff, when speaking in Amur 
Oblast the president might have had in mind all those who wear 
military uniform in Russia. But these are servicemen not only 
of the Defense Ministry but also of other ministries and 
departments. 
  "In particular," M. Kolesnikov continued, "there are the 
border troops, who number 50,000 men, the internal troops with 
350,000 men, and the railroad troops with 70,000. The Ministry 
of Communications, the Dalstroy [expansion unknown], and the 
Moscow Special Construction Trust have their own military 
subunits. In all, approximately 800,000 men in addition to the 
Defense Ministry. If you add this number to our composition, 
you will get a total of almost 3 million." 
  [Burbyga] What is the specific strength of the Armed Forces 
as of 16 June? 
  [Kolesnikov] We have reduced them by 700,000 in the course 
of two years. The authorized strength today is 2.002 million 
men. But the actual strength is considerably less. 
  [Burbyga] How many of them are generals? The largest number 
in the world, so the newspapers write? 
  [Kolesnikov] I would not dramatize this question. Speaking 
of the world, we hold the "golden" mean, as it were. For 
comparison: We have twice as many generals per serviceman as 
the United States and China, but half the number of Britain and 
France. We have provided for a significant reduction in 
generals' posts. Whereas there were 4,343 of them in 1989, 
2,070 are now left. A reduction to 1,780 is envisaged in the 
long term. 
  [Burbyga] The Army is frequently rebuked for reforming 
itself only slowly. Can the Armed Forces be reduced more 
quickly? 
  [Kolesnikov] Reform is primarily the business and concern of 
the state and the executive, not of the Army itself. We can 
take the role of experts and executors. For some reason the 
reform has been entrusted to us today. But all the executive's 
attention to the reforms is limited to the following demand: 
Carry out reduction more quickly.... But the Army needs 
considerable funds to carry out the reform, and we do not have 
them. It is a paradox, but it is more advantageous to us to 
transfer an officer to the reserve than to discharge him. This 
is because, before discharging an officer, it is necessary to 
pay him a posting allowance, to provide him with housing.... 
Otherwise there could be a sharp increase in social tension in 
society. 
  [Burbyga] It was reported recently that 25-30 people in the 
Army die every day for one reason or another. Is this so? 
  [Kolesnikov] There are people who have made themselves a 
career out of speculating with such figures. But the reality is 
that an average of three or four people die in the Army every 
day for various reasons. There are road transport accidents, 
injuries, suicides.... In 1992 1,746 servicemen died, in 1993 
1,359, and this year 417. We deeply regret every loss and death 
and endeavor to take all measures to avoid tragedies. 
  [Burbyga] A final question: How is your relationship with 
Army General Pavel Grachev, minister of defense? There are many 
contradictory rumors about this. 
  [Kolesnikov] I will say bluntly that I cannot count myself 
among the minister's personal friends. But we have a good 
working relationship. The first report to the minister every 
day is mine. I give him personally the most important documents. 
He signs the overwhelming majority of them. This attests to 
his trust both in me and in the General Staff.

  [Text] Reports about the outflow of nuclear materials from 
Russia have the sole goal of proving that the presence of 
nuclear weapons in Russia is dangerous to the world community 
and that Russia should be relieved of this burden, Russia's 
First Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy Lev Ryabev told INTERFAX. 
  These reports also reflect the ongoing struggle for the 
markets of nuclear expertise, he said. Some western countries 
have concentrated their attention on the traditionally Russian 
markets and are trying to discredit Russian science and 
industrial and nuclear potential. 
  He said that out of the 10 cases of theft of nuclear 
materials over the past 18 months, nine involved depleted 
uranium-238 which cannot be used for making a nuclear bomb. 
  He announced that highly enriched uranium-235 was stolen 
only 
once at the research center Luch in a Moscow suburb, when one 
staff member managed to steal about one and a half kilograms of 
this material. 
  "But even this amount is insufficient for making a bomb," 
said Ryabev. No other instances of theft of nuclear materials 
which can be used in nuclear weapons have been registered, he 
said.

  [Text] Most Black Sea Navy personnel disapprove plans to 
divide the fleet, a Naval Commander Aleksandr Penkin said in an 
interview with INTERFAX. 
  "The Fleet must be single, powerful, and battleworthy. It is 
in the common interests of Russia and Ukraine -- two great 
brotherly Slavic nations -- to secure the southern sea 
frontiers," Rear Admiral Aleksandr Penkin remarked and added 
that the Black Sea Navy Command was always prepared for 
constructive dialogue and smooth civilized ties with its 
Ukrainian counterpart. 
  If Ukraine takes over more than 160 ships through navy 
division, there will not be anyone to serve aboard the vessels 
since "the overwhelming majority of commissioned and 
noncommissioned officers in the Black Sea Navy are unwilling to 
join the Ukrainian Armed Forces." 
  Penkin suggested that there would also be problems for the 
Russian crews if the seamen who have sworn allegiance to Ukraine 
leave. He said that at the moment the navy is made up of an 
equal number of Ukrainians and Russians -- about 15,000 men on 
each side. 
  Penkin runs for the office of Chairman of Sevastopol's City 
Council from the Black Sea Fleet and the Sevastopol-Russia 
electoral bloc. 
  Local and presidential elections in Ukraine will take place 
on June 26.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentina Nikiforova and Pavel Filippov: "In </F>
Circumvention of the Constitution. The Presidential Edict Is 
More Ado About Crime"] 
  [Excerpts] On 14 June President Boris Yeltsin signed an 
edict "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population Against 
Gangsterism and Other Manifestations of Organized Crime." It 
talks in particular about enacting a system of urgent measures 
to combat it. Primarily total -- including criminal prosecution 
-- investigation not only of suspects but also their relatives, 
friends, and other individuals and corporate entities. [passage 
omitted] 
  Here is how the edict was assessed by Duma Security 
Committee 
Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin: 
  "The first impression: The mere fact of signing such an 
edict is a gross violation of the Constitution, a departure from 
criminal law procedures and substantive criminal law norms, and 
a violation of human rights and freedoms. The president has 
once again shown that he has not observed and is not going to 
observe the Constitution -- even the one that he drafted and 
spent enormous efforts to have approved. 
  "Second: Under normal conditions this regime cannot function 
or stand up to crime. In the end, nothing prevented the 
president from inviting the Duma to draft and approve a law to 
fight crime. And the situation would have changed drastically. 
In that event this struggle would be based on a clear-cut legal 
foundation. But no matter what may be said in presidential and 
government structures, there have been no results. And the 
edict is just a warning to criminals: Be more careful."

  [Text] The State Duma's Security Committee has unanimously 
described the Russian president's edict on urgent measures to 
protect the population from gangsterism and other manifestations 
of organized crime as contradicting the Constitution and 
existing legislation. This was stated on Thursday in an 
interview to Interfax by Viktor Ilyukhin. He noted that this 
fact was reflected in the State Duma's decision, which had been 
prepared on this matter. 
  The lower chamber plans to discuss the president's edict at 
a 
plenary meeting on Friday 17 June. Ilyukhin stressed that in 
conditions when the Constitutional Court is temporarily not 
operating, only the president can halt the operation of the 
edict. A recommendation to Boris Yeltsin to do this is also set 
out in the draft State Duma decision.

<F P=106> [Commentary by State Duma Deputy Boris Fedorov: "What Kind </F>
of State in Sovereign Russia?"] 
  [Text] During the celebration of Russia's sovereignty I 
have become extremely alarmed by the increasingly deep-rooted 
trend in our country of using the slogan of the state's 
interests to adopt decisions which are contrary to the laws and 
common sense. 
  In parliament there is an increasingly widespread idea that 
it would be no bad thing if deputies were to extend their own 
powers and perhaps those of other institutions of authority. 
  The Federation Council is examining questions which it has 
no 
right to examine and is trying to give advice cum injunctions to 
the State Duma (just try to imagine that sort of thing happening 
in relations between the Senate and the Congress or the House of 
Lords and the House of Commons!). 
  Many questions that fall within the competence of parliament 
are being decided by decrees and edicts. 
  A vast number of laws, edicts, and decrees are being 
implemented only partly or not at all. 
  The components of the Federation are adopting laws which 
conflict directly with the laws of the Russian Federation and 
sometimes conclude what are, to put it mildly, bizarre 
agreements with the "center." 
  What is there in common between all these and many other 
facts from our life? It is the fact that in all these cases the 
laws are being violated but everyone is pretending that nothing 
has happened and that nothing special is going on. But everyone 
is sitting in his own corner demanding benefits, subsidies, and 
aid for himself, his region, or his enterprise. And no one 
gives a damn for Russia. 
  The impression is being created that there are no citizens 
of 
Russia, there are only citizens of the military-industrial 
complex, the agro-industrial complex, Metrovagonmash [plant 
building subway cars], and the like. No one particularly wants 
a conflict: The protection of Russia from collapse in the 
direct and indeed any other sense of the word is not a topical 
issue. 
  At the time of the collapse of communism and the USSR there 
was much talk about the creation of a rule-of-law state and the 
final departure from the arbitrary rule and lawlessness which 
existed for decades. 
  Today, however, neither the democrats nor the lawyers say a 
word when the laws, beginning with the Constitution, are broken. 
No one is particularly bothered. An incredible toleration of 
lawlessness has developed. 
  Can you imagine the deputies of even one parliament in the 
civilized countries which might vote for an extension of their 
powers beyond those for which the electors voted? No matter how 
bad the electoral rules are, this is unacceptable. 
  No matter what the circumstances are, I personally will 
regard 12 December 1995 as the last day of my lawful mandate as 
a deputy. Especially since, given the absence of a real majority 
in parliament today, the elections should be brought forward, 
not put back. Otherwise the state will mark time. 
  The Federation Council, the State Duma, the government, and 
the president must operate strictly according to the 
Constitution and the laws, no matter how bad they seem. If 
unlawful legal acts are adopted in the components of the 
Federation, the state is obliged to repeal them, not to sign 
bizarre agreements. If individual parts of the country are, 
essentially, in revolt and declaring sovereignty, you cannot 
close your eyes to that fact. 
  Four years after the proclamation of its sovereignty, Russia 
is still not a rule-of-law state from the purely human 
viewpoint. Hence the absence of order, the crime, and the 
corruption, for which no one wants to bear responsibility. I 
hope that Russia will be able to celebrate both the fifth and 
the 10th anniversary of the restoration of its sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Asin: "Duma Perpetuates Serfdom In </F>
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] That was the assessment made by democrat deputies 
of the law "On Agricultural Cooperatives," which has passed its 
first reading in the lower house of the Russian parliament. 
This document consecrates the "indivisible land" of the 
existing collective farm-cooperatives and makes it impossible to 
allocate a plot (a share) of land to a collective farmer who 
wants to break away. The peasant's unconditional right to 
freely determine his own fate is replaced by whatever decision 
is reached by a general meeting, which is easily manipulated by 
our rural feudal lords. In approving the law the deputies were 
not deterred by the fact that many articles in the above law 
contravene the Russian Federation Civil Code which earlier also 
passed its first reading in this same Duma. 
  Igor Lukhashev, a deputy in the "Yabloko" faction, described 
the passing of the draft law as "perpetuating the basis for 
feudal relations in agriculture." In the voting, the document 
was supported by 248 deputies, with 50 voting against. Such is 
the real value of the present attempts by people in the Duma to 
pose as fighters for human rights.

Transportation Ministry to resume flights from Moscow to Groznyy 
that were suspended ostensibly for security considerations. 
  The ministry's letter emphasized that the situation was 
quiet 
in Groznyy. 
  The Chechen Foreign Ministry described the unilateral 
suspension of flights by Moscow as a violation of international 
law which does serious harm to bilateral relations.

Chechnya, Chechen Foreign Minister Shamsudin Yusef said today. 
He accused Moscow of refusing to normalize relations between 
the two countries. He mentioned the recent attempt on Dzhokhar 
Dudayev's life as an example of anti-Groznyy actions. 
  In the meantime, the military commandant of Chechnya has 
today demanded that illegal armed formations disband themselves 
and their leaders give themselves up. This decision by Sultan 
(Geleskhanov) is connected with recent clashes in Groznyy.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Boris Yeltsin by A. Shkirando at </F>
welcoming ceremony in Tuva; date not given; from the "Novosti" 
newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Shkirando] Boris Nikolayevich, you have just 
visited two very different regions of the country. How did this 
visit help to convince you about the unity of Russia? 
  [Yeltsin] This is an interesting question. You see, the 
unity of Russia does not mean a uniform way of living. It means 
unity of spirit. It is the unity of people's attitudes toward 
their motherland. I have seen confirmation of this in Amur 
Oblast as well as here. In relation to the living conditions, 
of course, there is a big difference. After all, when people 
earn 300,000 rubles there while a shepherd here gets 
100,000-120,000 rubles working in the hardest of conditions, 
having to move his flock and his campside every 15 days--this is 
not fair. This is a consequence of the mistake made on the 
federal level in setting the price for wool, and this mistake 
should be corrected. 
  [Shkirando] In the political sense, how close have these 
regions become to you as president and head of state? 
  [Yeltsin] You should put this question to them. 
  [Shkirando] But what are your impressions? 
  [Yeltsin] I think that they did come closer. 
  [Sherig-Ool Oorzhak, president of Tuva] We think that the 
subjects of the Russian Federation are getting closer day by 
day, strenghtening our common Russian statehood. 
  [Kaadar-Ool Bicheldey, chairman of the Tuva parliament] The 
visit of Boris Nikolayevich fulfills this task perfectly. We 
will be doing everything to make sure our people understand and 
appreciate this correctly. And we ourselves will be guided by 
the attention with which we are honoured.

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Frolov from the "Space" column: </F>
"Strategic Missile Base Will Become Cosmodrome"] 
  [Text] As SEGODNYA reported earlier, at a conference with 
representatives of the Amur Oblast Administration Boris Yeltsin 
discussed the question of building the Svobodnyy-18 cosmodrome. 
Now it has transpired that the president promised Major General 
Aleksandr Vinidiktov, chief of the Space Equipment Test and 
Operation Center, that he will make available 4 trillion rubles 
over the next 10 years to convert the former strategic missile 
base into a cosmodrome. 
  Until recently there were 60 launch silos at the base. Now 
the majority have been dismantled. Only five silos remain 
mothballed. But even this number is more than is required to 
launch small satellites: Only relatively small spacecraft can 
be launched from the silos. It was decided to keep only two of 
them. From 1996 satellites weighing up to 1.5 tonnes will be 
put into orbit from the territory of Amur Oblast with Rokot 
rockets. The whole project for building the new cosmodrome will 
call for substantial financial and manpower resources. Some 
10,000 people will be engaged in building various cosmodrome 
installations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen </F>
Ivanov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- In the near future a specially 
convened "council of professionals" will adopt an official 
decision on Russia's creation of a new cosmodrome in the Far 
East. One can evidently bank on a positive decision on this 
problem after the Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his 
support for the idea of the creation of a space test-range 
during his visit to Blagoveshchensk. 
  The sum of four trillion rubles specified by Boris Yeltsin 
as 
being necessary to upgrade the former missile division at 
Svobodnyy is the equivalent of approximately $2 billion dollars, 
while the continued operation of Baykonur for 20 years on the 
terms of its lease from Kazakhstan will cost 2.3 billion. If one 
considers that in its version of the lease agreement for 
Baykonur Kazakhstan has raised the price of its lease to $480 
million a year, 2 billion will be "run up" in just a few years. 
  In addition at the expiry of the period of lease the 
Kazakhstan side will be left with all the launching pads, since 
there is no question of the equipment being dismantled and 
removed. A number of experts consider therefore that it would 
be more beneficial to invest the same funds into the creation of 
Russia's own cosmodrome within its own territory, since it is 
hardly likely that anyone could make territorial claims on Amur 
Oblast. 
  The oblast itself is according to Vladimir Polevanov, its 
head of administration, "all for the cosmodrome." Indeed 
Svobodnyy-18 could right now accept 10,000 people to start its 
full-scale construction. In all the space port would provide 
56,000 people with jobs. 
  Meanwhile, prior to the convening of the "council of 
professionals", which will involve designers, producers and 
operators of space rocket equipment, planning work is already 
under way at Svobodnyy-18 to upgrade the rocket silos for the 
launching of Rokot carrier-rockets, the first of which is due to 
be launched in early 1996.

Yeltsin made a stopover in Novosibirsk this afternoon on the way 
to Moscow from eastern Russia. 
  Boris Yeltsin had a conversation with leaders of the oblast. 
During the conversation, Ivan Indinok, head of the oblast 
administration, said important problems in the oblast were 
touched on. He assessed the conversation with the president as 
very interesting and full. The head of administration said that 
the president had agreed to a request to send a government 
commission to the oblast to work with local experts on an 
analysis of the functioning of the administration and to 
consider aid issues. 
  Boris Yeltsin also asked about the outcome of the sowing 
season and expressed concern about the difficulty in harvesting. 
Ivan Indinok asked for combines to be sent to Novosibirsk, as 
the pool of vehicles is going to be greatly overloaded. 
  The president gave an instruction that sending a thousand 
combines to the oblast should be considered. This would be a 
tremendous support for us, the head of adminstration said about 
the president's decision.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
returned to Moscow on Thursday evening from a three-day working 
trip to the cities of Blagoveshchensk, the Tuva Republic capital 
Kyzyl and Novosibirsk. 
  The president visited Kyzyl on the final day of his tour. 
The Tuva Republic heavily depends on its relations with the 
outside world. Many difficulties would have been avoided if not 
for destroyed relations with other Russian regions. 
  Yeltsin noted at a meeting with the Tuva leaders that the 
republic borders Mongolia and has contacts with China -- it is 
necessary to develop these relations. The republic can be 
pulled out of the deep economic crisis only through stepped up 
development of contacts with other regions and through 
participation in the inter-regional association called "Siberian 
agreement". 
  Turning to the economic situation in the republic, Yeltsin 
noted that the main indices in Tuva are worse than the Russian 
average. The republic cannot live, relying only on its own 
resources. 
  The chief executive stressed that the strengthening of the 
Russian Federation is the president's most important task. "The 
state should have a single economic space and single 
legislation," he stressed. "Proceeding from this premise, it is 
necessary to tap unique possibilities of Russia's every region." 
  Speaking of his working trip to the Amur region on May 15, 
the Russian leader said that that region, according to the 
structure of its economy, should be self-sufficient. It can 
live without subsidies. The president did not put forth the 
same task before Tuva. 
  "The difference between ratios and living standards is too 
great. It would be unjust to say: live, relying on your own 
resources. People and leaders are not to blame for a shortage of 
resources, and nobody reproaches them for this. 
  "This is the way Tuva's economy has shaped up. Therefore, we 
should help the republic so much as to bridge the gap between 
the living standards of its people and those of entire Russian 
population." 
  The president noted that he does not intend to limit himself 
only to promises but gave guarantees to the Tuva leaders of a 
substantial aid from the federal budget. 
  Yeltsin pointed to Tuva's rich natural resources. In the 
president's opinion, the republic can provide itself with 
timber, electricity and develop tourism. The development of 
infrastructure and the transportation system is the pressing 
problem of the region. 
  The chief executive said in conclusion that efforts should 
be 
made to implement two decrees he signed in Tuva to develop the 
economy and the social sphere in the republic. The president 
noted that the former mistrust between the centre and the Tuva 
leadership has disappeared, and the republic has removed the 
tense racial atmosphere which was present there two years ago. 
  Therefore, the main thing now is joint actions to pull the 
republican economy out of the crisis in order to create normal 
social conditions for the Tuva population, Yeltsin concluded. 
  En route to Moscow, the Russian leader made a stopover in 
Novosibirsk where he had a meeting with the regional leaders. 
Head of the regional administration Ivan Indinok who 
participated in the meeting, described it as very interesting 
and substantive. 
  He said that the president agreed with a request to send to 
the region a government commission which should examine, 
together with local specialists, the administration's activities 
and consider questions of rendering assistance. 
  Yeltsin was also interested in the results of the spring 
sowing and expressed concern over the coming difficult 
harvesting. Indinok told the chief executive that 30 per cent 
of ploughland were sown with substandard seeds. However, the 
region managed to avoid cutting acreage under spring crops. 
  The regional leaders expressed a request to send combine 
harvesters to the region, since the workload on the present 
fleet will be very great. 
  The president gave instructions to examine the question of 
delivering 1,000 combine harvesters to the region. "This will be 
a serious support for us," Indinok commented on the president's 
decision.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Sugak] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov 
has qualified the Russian president's decree on urgent measures 
for the defence of the population from bandits and other forms 
of organised crime as a very important and timely measure. 
Luzhkov pointed out that an extremely tense criminal situation 
in the country and ways out of it are the most important 
problems faced by the city today. 
  He pointed out that the situation in the city had acquired 
an 
entirely different character by now. Earlier, mafia structures 
used to settle scores between themselves, building up tension in 
the city without directly affecting the life of city residents, 
whereas today, the level of criminal activities not only 
expanded in scope, but acquired an entirely different quality. 
It affects major businessmen, bankers and other business people 
who are involved in the formation of new economy in the city. 
  A recent statement made by the board of the "Logovaz" joint 
stock society in connection with an attempt on the life of its 
director general has exasperated the city authorities, Luzhkov 
said. Apart from prominent activists, major state and 
commercial agents, common people die, who have nothing to do 
with this but and who happened to be on the scene of the tragedy. 
  "To transfer the police to a reinforced system of 
maintenance 
of law and order - this is what the new decree provides for," 
the mayor said. He pointed out that the city is prepared to 
meet the interests of the most important department for ensuring 
the city's well-being as never before: police stations are 
being provided with new premises and funds are being allocated, 
including hard currency, to provide the police with the 
necessary facilities and equipment.

  [Text] Moscow June 15 TASS -- Moscow's police continue the 
operation code-named "Mak" (Poppy) on the Moscow metro in an 
attempt to curb the rising wave of crime in the Russian capital. 
  Over the two weeks since the beginning of the operation, the 
police have seized over 20 kilograms of drugs. 
  On Tuesday, on one of the metro stations they detained a 
resident of Tajikistan who was carrying one kilogram of opium. 
An investigation was launched. 
  The operation is generally viewed as part of the federal 
anti-crime programme approved by the president. The government 
plans to spend about five trillion roubles to implement it, 
hoping to receive back twice as much. 
  The programme largely expands the rights of law enforcement 
bodies and provides for a greater role of counterintelligence in 
fighting organised crime in Russia. Counterintelligence service 
leaders said they will set up a special body to take active 
measures to combat the rising wave of crime and will act in 
cooperation with other crime-fighting organisations. Similar 
bodies are planned to be set up in several big Russian cities, 
including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. 
  On Tuesday, President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree giving 
Russia's police new powers to fight organised crime which has 
been lately terrorizing most Russian cities. 
  To prevent possible criticism of the decree, a high-ranking 
Russian counterintelligence official said earlier today that the 
decree does not infringe upon civil right and curbs only the 
rights of criminal groupings. Yevgeniy Sevostyanov, head of the 
counterintelligence service in Moscow and the Moscow region, 
said that the decree aims at protecting the population of Russia 
from organised crime. "The adopted measures limit only the 
rights of the members of criminal gangs and their direct 
accomplices," he said.

  [Text] Is it true that there are radioactive waste storage 
facilities on Moscow territory? 
  [signed] A. Pecherskaya, Krasnoyarsk. 
  As we were told at the Russian Federation Federal 
Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor], 
there are 49 nuclear research installations on the capital's 
territory. These include the research reactors belonging to the 
Kurchatov Center, which is located in a densely populated part 
of the city. The amount of radioactive waste stored both at the 
center's own site and at other establishments is in excess of 
200 tonnes. The Gosatomnadzor inspectorate for the capital 
believes that all this waste represents a threat to the safety 
of the city's inhabitants. However, the government has not 
allocated the resources for removing the radioactive waste and 
dismantling the reactors. It will cost around 15 billion rubles.

  [From the "Kray News" program] 
  [Text] The Khabarovsk Kray Committee of the Russian 
Federation Communist Party adopted two announcements: The first 
states that the communists, like all Russians, support friendly 
and good neighborly relations with the PRC. At the same time, 
the communists believe that the development of Russian-Chinese 
relations should be developed while taking into account 
interests of the Far East territories and the inviolability of 
existing borders. Thus, they fully support the Khabarovsk Kray 
administration's position and demand that the Russian Government 
renounce the 1991 border agreement as incompatible with existing 
realities and signed without coordination with Khabarovsk Kray. 
They further demand full and profound talks with China with the 
participation of kray representatives. 
  Another announcement states that lately, some mass media 
have 
been actively commenting on the situation of DPRK loggers 
employed at logging camps in the Far East in accordance with an 
agreement signed by the Russian Federation and the DPRK. This 
coverage has especially intensified by several steps taken 
lately by South Korean authorities and aimed at examining the 
so-called human rights question. These acts go as far as the 
kidnapping of North Korean loggers from Russian Federation 
territory. The kray communist party believes that the South 
Korean authorities' actions amount to no less that interference 
in the internal affairs of sovereign states who have signed the 
appropriate agreements, are completely impermissible in 
relations between states, and constitute an attempt to sabotage 
the mutually profitable economic relations between Russia and 
the DPRK. According to the kray party committee, this 
encourages ethnic hostility and confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula, which is fraught with many negative consequnences.

  [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev and Abish Kekilbayev have 
arrived in Mangistay Oblast. The same day, on Monday [13 June] 
afternoon, they had a meeting with representatives of different 
national cultural associations. They were briefed on the work, 
which is being carried out by them, and which is aimed at 
strengthening friendship and peace between representatives of 
different ethnic groups of the region. The head of state 
assured them that he will do everything so that peace, civil 
accord, and understanding prevailed in the area. Without this 
the republic would not be able to achieve success in its market 
reforms and raise the living standards of Kazakhstanis. 
  The next day Nazarbayev and the speaker of the parliament 
familiarized themselves with the work of the chemical and 
hydro-metallurgical works and the produce that it manufactures. 
This is the unique enterprises and it manufactures mineral 
fertilizers which are quite popular in the local market. The 
works have recently started the production of scandium which is 
in great demand both in the CIS and other foreign countries. It 
also intends to manufacture some other rare earth metals. The 
head of state stressed that their main task is to meet our 
country's needs in these produce and only then to think about 
selling surpluses to foreign partners. There are many orders 
from foreign partners at the moment. 
  Nazarbayev and Kekilbayev held a meeting at the works with 
leaders of industrial enterprises of Aktau and the region. The 
chairman of the council of directors Marabayev briefed them on 
the situation in the region and the problems that cannot be 
tackled on their own. In particular, he said that with all this 
oil and gas condensate, and other minerals that the region is 
extracting and making an essential contribution to the 
republican economy with, Mangistay still cannot create 
appropriate social and housing conditions for its citizens. 
  Nazarbayev promised his support in tackling these issues and 
at the same time he said that this depends mainly on the efforts 
and efficiency of the works. Mangistau is a sort of a nature 
monument with monuments from the paleolithic age up to the 
present day. No other region of the Republic can be compared to 
it. There are more than 20,000 archeological and architectural 
monuments. Each of them is extremely valuable. Some of them 
were visited by the leaders of the Republic. Nazarabyev noted 
that what has been created by our ancestors and by nature is 
irreplaceable. Therefore, no matter how difficult it is we 
should find resources to protect them and pass them over to the 
next generations.

  [Text] The mutual payments for delivered and repaired 
military equipment between the armed forces of Russia and 
Belarus will be performed at prices set for the two countries' 
own armies, Russian First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin told a news conference in Minsk Thursday [16 June]. 
  He said that according to a protocol signed with Belarussian 
First Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Tushinskiy Thursday all 
contracts between the two countries' military enterprises will 
be concluded directly, without mediators. This will enable both 
countries to significantly reduce their military expenditures. 
  For his part, Tushinskiy pointed to the importance of the 
agreement to start bilateral consultations on the utilization of 
components of the fuel used for surface-to-air missiles and 
bombs. At present, Belarus lacks its own technologies and 
equipment for this, Tushinskiy said. 
  Representatives of the two countries' commands supported the 
creation of joint military enterprises and financial and 
industrial groups to manufacture a wide range of products.

<F P=106> [Speech by Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich at </F>
the Kirov plant in Minsk; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Unfortunately, the 
termination of political opposition between East and West did 
not make the world absolutely safe or stable. Differences and 
contradictions are currently beginning to appear between large 
and small states, those which have the potential for raw 
materials and those who depend on shipments of the latter [words 
indistinct]. In light of this, the nature of Belarusian 
conditions for reforming the economy is quite specific; it 
cannot be understood without taking into account the role of the 
Belarusian economy in the single economic complex of the former 
USSR. Under the conditions of a centrally administered planned 
economy, huge enterprises were concentrated on Belarusian soil, 
engaged in the processing of raw materials and semifinished 
products, as well as the manufacturing of end products. Those 
enterprises used to be linked with suppliers in all regions of 
the USSR within the framework of a single national system. 
  Then the collapse occurred and brought about a dramatic 
disruption in existing economic relations. As a result of this, 
the Belarusian economy found itself overnight in dire straits. 
Administrative levers have been, for the most part, lost, while 
the structure of market motivation has not yet been created. 
Unfortunately, economic reform, a need for which has matured in 
our society, actually turned into a curse word for many people, 
just as with the word perestroyka. Our numerous compatriots 
cannot psychologically accept reform, because who needs reform 
when it encroaches on the vital interests of the people? It is 
a well-known fact that territorial-ethnic conflicts on the 
territory of the former USSR, and not just conflicts but wars 
too, were primarily caused by the dramatic plunge in people's 
living standards. With regard to this, I would like to point 
out that certain politicians in our country, driven by unknown 
motives, are trying to transform economic reform into interstate 
conflicts and prevent natural civilized rapprochement between 
Belarus and Russia. As you know, ideological cliches -- which 
are absolutely alien to Belarusians -- are being used to block 
this process: Russia is depicted as an imperial state that is 
heading in a different direction. I want to state this with 
full responsibility: We have been carefully examining all new 
trends in the theory and practice of contemporary interstate 
economic relations. Yes, we, earlier than anybody else, 
assessed the so-called economic theories of our local opponents, 
who envision reorienting the Belarusian economy from the 
traditional union with Russia along the East-West axis, toward 
the allegedly new North-South axis, also called the Baltic-Black 
Sea belt. I would put it this way: The obsoleteness of this 
theory becomes evident given that as long ago as the turn of the 
20th century the geopolitical senselessness of such views and 
their economic and political deficiency were proven, as well as 
the impossibility to implement this idea in light of the 
existing balance of forces in the world arena. Our economy's 
current problems and hardships were not caused by its internal 
incongruities, but rather by dependence on external factors. 
[passage omitted] 
  We were finally demonstrated who feeds whom. We once used to 
holler that all the republics feed Russia. We were shown the 
contrary quite fast. We were trying to (?discuss) the Orsha 
defeat [reference to victory of Lithuanian-Belarusian troops 
over Russia in the mid-16th century]; meanwhile, our gas and oil 
supplies were cut off. It was not in 1500 or so that we lost or 
won that battle; we lost the battle now, following the economic 
sanctions that had been used against us. Let us not forget 
this. [passage omitted] 
  Let us look at Europe, which has came close to creating the 
European Union in the form of a single state structure built on 
the basis of federalism. What do we see? We see the evident 
striving by European states to secure free movement of people, 
products, services, and capital. They have decided to adopt a 
common monetary unit, introduce single European citizenship, and 
(?form) the European Parliament. Thus, Europe, having lived 
through two world wars, has chosen a new path of development -- 
one of economic and political integration. We are actually 
dealing with the formation of a powerful integrated structure of 
a single European state. Nobody says that the expansion of 
supranational powers among the European structures will in some 
way limit state sovereignty. I am quite positive that in the 
near future we will also come to realize the prospects and 
actual advantages of the integration of the newly independent 
states, and find ways to achieve closer rapprochement. 
Otherwise, we will not survive. We will collapse. That is why 
I clearly state that as long as I am the head of the Belarusian 
Government, the latter will not change the course of integration 
with Russia, Ukraine, and other independent states. Yes, we 
support the economic union and the single ruble zone. The 
creation of supranational structures similar to the European 
Parliament may become a natural continuation of this process. 
At the same time, dear colleagues, I am not speaking about 
surrendering our Republic's sovereignty and independence. 
Simplicity and primitivism of such views on state construction, 
as represented by People's Deputy Lukashenka, are alien to me. 
The wheel of history can only roll forward and cannot be 
reversed. I will never, nor under any circumstances agree to 
surrender sovereignty and give up the state independence of 
Belarus. Never. 
  I am sure, however, that the union will be revived in a new 
form and Belarus will enter it as an independent, sovereign 
state. Speaking of preserving our sovereignty -- for there is 
much criticism on this issue -- I want to point out that it is 
easy and simple to declare sovereignty. State sovereignty, 
however, must be protected. Without protection there can be no 
sovereignty. I am more than positive that if today we are left 
without Russia, no matter who is at the helm, we will be thrown 
10 to 15 years back into the past, or even face economic 
collapse. Believe me, we calculated these things both on 
computers and by other means -- various options. Go to Europe? 
Who is admitted into Europe? Great Russia is not admitted into 
Europe! There are just promises and nothing but promises. All 
markets were divided long ago. Both oil and gas used in Europe 
come from Russia, and not from any other state. Shall we go to 
the West to buy Russian oil from middlemen at a higher price? 
No! We would rather look to the East. All products and raw 
materials will be supplied to Belarus duty-free. This will lower 
prices by 35 to 40 percent, lower productions costs, and retail 
prices, which swelled solely due to customs duties and not due 
to our inability to work. [passage omitted] 
  Russia's economy is sick, but it is not dead and buried. 
Many times in its history Russia has surprised the world with 
the power of its spirit, with its might, and always risen up 
from the ashes. This time, these processes are also beginning in 
Russia. We are facing difficulties, but let us not dash aside; 
history, future generations, our conscience, and dignity would 
never forgive us this. [passage omitted] 
  The Constitution adopted in March by our legislature 
preserved the vertical system of soviets. History has proven 
that this system corresponds to the national and political 
traditions of our people better than other variants. The 
history of the last two years has taught us what may come of 
neglecting those traditions. Workers and farmers have 
practically been pushed out of the soviets. Their voices cannot 
be heard there. They were replaced by photographers, 
archaeologists [reference to Popular Front Chairman Zyanon 
Paznyak], and Leopold cats with doctorate degrees [reference to 
former Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich, who, like the 
cartoon character, often appealed for accord]. Whose interests 
these people represent, I do not have to explain to you. 
[passage omitted] 
  Why do Paznyak and Shushkevich so furiously attack our union 
with Russia, accusing me of everything short of national 
treason? Despite their mediocre organizing skills and total lack 
of economic and technological experience, they understand all 
too well that there will be no place for them on the political 
field of the Belarusian-Russian union. However the provincial 
[word indistinct] of one of them and the taste for cushy 
executive jobs of the other, urge them to engage in adventurist 
irrational activities. That is not a big deal. We, the people 
who grew up in plants and factories, have strong nerves. We 
will withstand both ridiculous political aspirations and 
primitive slanders. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It is quite probable that in the near future the 
Defense Ministry of Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] will embark on the 
formation of another subunit forming part of the CIS peacemaking 
forces. As an RIA correspondent has been informed, it is 
envisaged that Kirghiz servicemen will defend the interests of 
the Commonwealth on the mobile [podvizhnaya] border between 
Georgia and Abkhazia. This was occasioned by the agreement 
between Russia and Georgia on introduction of Russian 
peacemaking forces.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Kotov] </F>
  [Text] Delhi, 17 June -- India is seriously interested in a 
dialogue between the Government of Tajikistan and opposition 
groupings on national reconciliation, which is being conducted 
at the United Nation's initiative. However, the Indian 
Government has decided to leave open the issue of its 
participation alongside with Pakistan and Iran as an observer at 
these talks, a regular round of which will take place in 
Islamabad soon. 
  Salman Khurshid, Indian minister of state for external 
affairs, stated this position of the Republic during his visit 
to Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent was informed by sources in the Indian Ministry of 
External Affairs that the minister of state informed Prime 
Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in detail about the results of his 
talks with the leaders of the central Asian countries and in 
particular about the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. In 
the opinion of sources at the Indian Ministry of External 
Affairs, the situation on the border between Tajikistan and 
Afghanistan will be discussed during the upcoming visit of the 
head of the Indian government to the Russian Federation 29 
June-2 July. 
  India intends to maintain close contacts with all the 
participants in the inter-Tajik through its embassy in Dushanbe 
talks because it is very concerned about the situation on the 
border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan. In New Delhi's 
opinion, it influences the situation in the entire region and 
can affect India's security, which is anxious that the conflict 
in Tajikistan not become threatening and not become a repeat of 
the bloody Afghan war. 
  Nevertheless, representatives of the Republic's Ministry of 
External Affairs stressed that India's official participation in 
the talks between the Tajik Government and opposition as an 
observer is deemed inexpedient as such a precedent may lead to 
Pakistan intensifying its demands to be included in possible 
talks between the Indian Government and Muslim political 
groupings on normalizing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

  [Text] On 16 June in Tashkent a joint sitting of the 
Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet of the Republic was 
held. It was chaired by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. The 
introduction of the national currency, replenishing the home 
consumer market with necessary goods, strengthening the export 
potential of the enterprises in the Republic, and the new system 
of state and social protection of families with children were 
discussed. The president said the main prerequisite for 
establishing an independent state, providing for the welfare and 
[word indistinct] of the people is the creation of a highly 
developed and independent economy. The main aim of the current 
economic reforms being carried out in the Republic is directed 
at this. An independent economy requires that the country has 
its own currency with a high purchasing power and credibility. 
  The national currency, like the flag, the hymn, and the 
constitution, is one of the symbols of the state and the people 
and is a sacred symbol of independence. We prepared ourselves a 
long time ago for introducing the unit of national currency. 
Our specialists carefully studied the experiences of foreign 
countries and CIS countries in this field. During the first 
phase the sum-coupons will be circulated along with this 
national currency, and we have gained sufficient experience in 
this area and carried out necessary checks. With the help of an 
intermediate currency we tackled a number of financial tasks, 
and now the time has come for the full national currency, said 
the president. It is well known that one cannot fulfill great 
aims only with the introduction of a new currency. It is, 
therefore, necessary to start preparing now for increasing the 
purchasing power of our currency and provide it with credibility 
at world standards. This demands that we replenish the consumer 
market and ensure the priority of exports over imports. This 
requires sharp increases abroad in the sale of goods produced in 
the Republic. A mechanism for a finance and credit policy in 
the country, reliable social protection for the needy, 
particularly families with children, is necessary for the 
country. 
  At the session Mullojonov, chairman of the directorate of 
the 
Central Bank; Deputy Prime Ministers Usmonv and Sultanov; and 
[name indistinct], first deputy minister for labor, talked about 
the issues in question. The order and time of transfer to the 
national currency, the government measures to be taken in 
relation to this, the new structure of the state, and social 
protection of families with children were discussed in detail. 
There is an old saying that the humanity of any state and the 
spirit of the community comes from respect for women and 
children, said the president. Improving the structure of the 
social protection of families with children, aimed at their 
material support, is of great importance. In essence, a child 
up to 16 years old will be under the care of the state. The 
budget's contributions to this will be increased many fold. 
  In conclusion, the president noted that independent 
Uzbekistan is on verge of a taking a great step. We are taking 
another big step on the path to economic independence and will 
have our own currency. This is also a great step. We should 
fully understand that our national currency is like a newborn 
child of which we should be proud and at the same time take good 
care of it and protect it. We all must work for increasing the 
value and the purchasing power of our sum. Prime Minister 
Mutalov; Bugrov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet; chairmen 
of the committees of the Supreme Soviet; and deputy prime 
ministers and heads of corresponding ministries, departments, 
organizations, and banking institutions participated in this 
session.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("LRAGIR" daily), 06/16/94 -- The RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] military experts believe, 
despite several defeats in winter and spring, Azerbaijan still 
has a significant attack potential, and keeps expansive 
intentions. 
  Attempting to defeat the RMK at any price, Azerbaijan 
violates the international agreements it has signed. 
Particularly, based on the agreement on normal [conventional] 
armaments in Europe, this country was only allowed to have 220 
tanks. Nevertheless, according to the RMK military 
reconnaissance, the Azeri army has long exceeded the allowed 
limits. In parallel with this, based on Aliyev's special order, 
a number of large enterprises in Azerbaijan are producing and 
modernizing weaponry. 
  "All these alarming military preparations, as well as fast 
militarization of the economy are originating from the 
all-Turkish idea of creating a Great Azerbaijan," declared 
Deputy Commander in Chief of the RMK defense army Murad 
Petrosyan. "This country has territorial claims to, in fact, 
all neighboring countries and particularly for the Bolnisi and 
Marneuli districts of Georgia, southern districts of Dagestan, 
northern regions of Iran and Zangezur district of Armenia. The 
RMK has become the first target of the Azeri hegemonists, who 
receive military-political support of Turkey". 
  On Petrosyan's opinion not only the future of the RMK 
people, 
but fortunes of a number of countries in Close East and 
Transcaucasia depend on the results of the Karabakh-Azerbaijan 
war.

<F P=106> [Report by the Russian Federation Embassy Press Service in </F>
Armenia: "Declaration of the Russian Federation Embassy in 
Armenia"] 
  [Text] Articles of anti-Russian orientation have 
recently been published on the pages of certain local 
newspapers. These articles are clearly written by a foreign 
author. 
  We know that he who pays the piper calls the tune. 
  It would be possible not to pay attention to this were it 
not 
for the fact that hidden behind these published materials, which 
in a number of instances bear the nature of personal attacks 
against the Russian ambassador to Armenia, are the coordinated 
actions of certain forces that are pursuing the objective of 
slandering the foreign policy of Russia with respect to 
countries of the near abroad. 
  Clearly it is no accident that the appearance of such 
articles coincides time-wise with the shift beginning to be seen 
in the Karabakh settlement, achieved to a great extent thanks to 
the active peacemaking efforts of Russia and the 
interparliamentary assembly of the CIS. 
  Russia does not dictate its will to the sovereign republics 
of the former USSR, does not interfere in their internal 
affairs, does not seek any advantage from the difficulties they 
have to endure, and does not impose on its friends. Such policy 
is alien to Russia. 
  Russia is interested in peace and stability along its 
borders 
and in the regions adjacent to it, so as to give its undivided 
attention to accomplishing its own internal political, economic, 
and other tasks. 
  There can be no doubt but that all the attempts of enemies 
and those pretending to be Russia's friends to impede the 
development of Russian-Armenian relations, which are on the 
rise, and to sow seeds of mistrust between Armenia and Russia 
are doomed to failure.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric] </F>
  [Text] The republic's parliament has approved two draft 
laws on entering and exiting the country, and on identity cards 
for citizens of Azerbaijan. Under the "entry and exit" law, 
exit is restricted for those convicted of crimes, under 
investigation, or drafted for military service, as well as for 
persons under obligations not to divulge state secrets. Three 
types of external passports have been approved: civilian, 
service, and diplomatic. The law on identity cards for citizens 
of the republic calls for two types of identity cards: for 
those under 16, and for those past that age. The plastic cards 
will include the name in full, nationality, age, marital status, 
eligibility for military service, and a photograph. All the 
information on the cards will be put in a unified bank of data 
about the country's citizens open for use by the republic's 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of National Security, and 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The introduction of identity cards 
will be financed from the budget at a total cost of nearly six 
million manats. All passports of the former USSR are supposed 
to be replaced by identity cards before the end of 1996.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Geydar Aliyev by unidentified </F>
INTERFAX correspondent -- place and date not given; "Exclusive" 
report No. 24] 
  [Text] INTERFAX: The first question is about the political 
situation in Azerbaijan. The removal of two leaders of the 
Popular Front from the National Assembly has been regarded by 
the opposition as the president's blow against democracy. How 
true is that? 
  Aliyev: Not at all. There is no threat to democracy in 
Azerbaijan. The country has 43 registered political parties. 
It publishes scores of newspapers and only one of them 
"AZERBAIJAN" is official, it is a newspaper of the parliament 
and carries official documents. 
  Even the Popular Front functions normally despite all the 
unlawful, anti-government actions of some of its members. When 
it launches a campaign based on mildly speaking unconfirmed 
facts, official bodies only warn it. 
  That is what happened when the Popular Front attacked the 
Bishkek protocol. (The protocol signed in Kyrgyzstan on the 
separation of forces in Nagorno-Karabakh with the help of an 
international force. - IF) Supporters of the Popular Front are 
invited to settle all their problems in parliament. I must say 
that they do not always heed such suggestions. 
  As for the dropping of two Front members from parliament, it 
is quite normal. At the end of 1990 Azerbaijan elected a 350 
seat parliament. Later when the Popular Front fought against 
the Communist leadership it forced Communists to make 
concessions and set up a 50 member National Assembly in which 25 
members represented the Popular Front and the rest were 
Communists. 
  When Ayaz Mutalibov (the Azeri Communist leader -IF) was 
removed from power and the Popular Front governed the country, 
it denied all deputies not belonging to the National Assembly 
the possibility to perform their duties. Some tried to collect 
signatures under protest petitions, but the Popular Front 
stopped these efforts even though that was a crying violation of 
the rights of deputies. When the National Assembly was formed, 
the rotation of its members was implied. Now this right was 
exercised: two members were dropped from the National Assembly 
and replaced by two other deputies. Still like others they 
remain full-fledged deputies. 
  INTERFAX: But they have no rights. 
  Aliyev: That is not quite so. They did not have any rights. 
But when I was elected the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, I 
announced that all deputies have the right to attend sessions of 
the National Assembly. Earlier they were not allowed to do that. 
  INTERFAX: The restrictions on the freedom of speech and the 
press in Azerbaijan are often criticized by the media in CIS 
countries. 
  Aliyev: Newspapers in Azerbaijan are published regularly. As 
I said "AZERBAIJAN" carrying official documents is the only 
government newspaper. Such newspapers as "BAKINSKIY RABOCHY" 
which used to be a newspaper of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party, "KOMMUNIST" now called "VYSHKA" and "BAKU" are 
now independent. I want to emphasize that the State Council 
does not try impose its ideas on journalists. 
  INTERFAX: You said the deputies dismissed from the National 
Assembly keep their rights, is that true? 
  Aliyev: Yes, they do. When I was elected the chairman of the 
Supreme Soviet I announced that all deputies have the right to 
attend sessions of the National Assembly, but I failed to cancel 
an earlier decision denying them the right to vote. 
  Later I started inviting uninvolved deputies to 
parliamentary 
committees. A normal parliament should have at least ten or 
twelve committees, but if there are only 50 persons and some of 
them might fall ill, committees would consists of three or four 
people. Could they be called parliamentary committees? 
  Thus I think I managed to somewhat raise the standard of 
democracy in the country. Therefore I think that the 
replacement of two deputies by way of rotation is quite normal. 
Besides, I see no reason why such matters should be linked with 
my name -- it is a parliamentary affair. 
  INTERFAX: In other words you want to say you have nothing to 
do with the change of the deputies? 
  Aliyev: Absolutely nothing. By the way, I learned about it 
only at the end of the day and was quite surprised. I think the 
racket around my name in this context is necessary only for 
opposition parties as a pretext for aggravating the situation. 
  INTERFAX: Azerbaijan now has a Supreme Soviet and the 
National Assembly. This two-tier system of elected bodies 
resembles the last years of the USSR: the Congress of People's 
Deputies, the Supreme Soviet. Don't you think Azerbaijan needs 
new parliamentary elections? 
  Aliyev: I do. Firstly, because the parliament was elected 
under the Communist regime. You know my attitude to the 
Communist Party: I officially left it. Secondly, the Supreme 
Soviet was artificially squeezed by an arbitrary decision of the 
Popular Front that was working toward its own goals. By the 
way, there is no clause in our constitution allowing such 
decisions. Neither is there such a provision in other former 
Soviet republics. Still from the legal viewpoint there is a 
year left till the next elections. 
  It should also be remembered that 20 percent of Azeri 
territory is occupied (by the armed forces of Nagorno-Karabakh 
and Armenia, according to Baku's interpretation - IF). There 
are about one million refugees in the country. There is a war. 
Thank God, we have brought about a cease-fire, but minor 
exchanges of fire continue. In these conditions, I think, 
elections must not be held. 
  However, as president I am convinced that the country needs 
a 
new parliament democratically elected by the people. It is not 
so important whether it will have 100 or 200 members. The main 
thing is that it should be professional and permanently 
functioning. 
  INTERFAX: Do you think elections are possible only after 
the restoration of peace and with the participation of Karabakh? 
  Aliyev: Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, therefore its 
participation in the elections is necessary. In reality, 
though, it is difficult to expect people of Nagorno-Karabakh to 
be able to cast their ballots in the near future, even though 
the election law has been worked out. 
  INTERFAX: There is an opinion that now that the war is under 
way, the parliament is blocking the transition to presidential 
rule which would make the country more controllable. What do 
you think of that? 
  Aliyev: I must say that I have heard such proposals from the 
public. It was suggested, for example, that the president 
declare martial law, introduce a curfew in certain regions. But 
I did not agree to that because such steps would restrict 
certain democratic rights and orders proclaimed by me. My main 
objective is to strengthen democracy in Azerbaijan. 
  INTERFAX: Another question in this context: a coalition 
government and the approval of a new constitution. There is 
much talk on the subject now in Azerbaijan. 
  Aliyev: The two matters are interconnected. Can the present 
parliament which is actually crippled adopt a new constitution? 
I think a new constitution is necessary. As president I could 
suggest my own version of the fundamental law and submit it for 
a nationwide debate and have it approved through a referendum. 
But that would also require a parliament. 
  Besides, ill-wishers would interpret that as an attempt by 
Aliyev to grab all power. Still I believe the adoption of the 
constitution is a prerogative of parliament while the president 
can only submit proposals and drafts. 
  I would want to repeat, though, that the country needs a new 
constitution as we now live according to a constitution approved 
in 1978 by the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan, not an 
independent state. 
  As for a coalition government, it is out of the question. 
What right do the Popular Front and other opposition groups 
have to join the cabinet? The country has a popularly elected 
president who in keeping with the law appoints ministers. 
  INTERFAX: Do you as president feel that your orders are 
being 
carried out, that you are in control unlike your predecessors? 
  Aliyev: There are no doubts that I have the power and it is 
also clear that I can use it. 
  There is another thing I would want to say. When in June 
1991 in Moscow I announced my resignation from the Communist 
Party and returned to Baku, life there was made unbearable for 
me: the local authorities ostracized me. A commission was set 
up to look into my past activities etc. 
  Then I went to Nakhichevan where the situation changed after 
the August coup attempt in Moscow: the regional party committee 
was closed. I was a member of the local parliament then. It 
was in session for two days to elect a new chairman. Over 
60,000 people rallied in the town and did not disperse for two 
days demanding that I come to parliament and lead it. I assumed 
the responsibility. 
  In those days Mutalibov still worked in Baku and he set the 
date for presidential elections for September 8. I said in 
parliament that the elections should be postponed because 
Mutalibov is not worthy of the post and is responsible for the 
developments in January 1990 and supported the coup leaders in 
Moscow. Besides, he was the only candidate. Mutalibov sent 
troops to Nakhichevan, but the people supported me. 
  After Mutalibov's resignation the public demanded my return 
to Baku: I was nominated candidate to the post of speaker of 
parliament. However, I turned the proposal down. A member of 
the Popular Front was elected speaker and Abulfaz Elchibei 
president. 
  After a time these persons started pressuring me, but the 
people saved me again. However, in Nakhichevan I remained in 
isolation. 
  Finally after the tragic developments last June when the 
country was practically in the state of civil war the speaker of 
parliament, prime-minister and president persuaded me to come to 
Baku. I refused for a long time, but finally agreed. I want to 
say that I returned not because I wanted that -- I did not fight 
for power at all -- the course of developments brought me to 
presidency. 
  Besides, after becoming the head of state I left old 
officials in my office, members of the Popular Front, even 
though some of them sabotage my decisions. This is a fact. 
  Nevertheless I believe that my power is so strong that I can 
bear all that for the sake of keeping the principles of 
democracy. 
  INTERFAX: Now let us switch to the complicated question of 
Karabakh. Negotiations now continue with the mediation of a 
special envoy of the Russian president V.Kazimirov. Has there 
been any progress? 
  Aliyev: I would not want to disclose the matter yet. In 
general terms I can say that I want an end to war and a peaceful 
settlement of the Karabakh question. The war will not be 
victorious for either Armenia, or Azerbaijan. 
  But the question should be settled on a fair basis, on the 
basis of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and 
inviolability of Azerbaijan. 
  In this context I would want to say that the CSCE Minsk 
group 
for Karabakh has done little to settle the conflict, even though 
I find the involvement of the international organizations in the 
process necessary. Russia is a member of the Minsk group but it 
also makes its own efforts to stop the war. 
  INTERFAX: What is your attitude to the sending of a 
separating force to the conflict zone? 
  Aliyev: We cannot do without it, but it should act under the 
auspices of the CSCE. 
  INTERFAX: But can Russian troops be its part? 
  Aliyev: They can, but with a mandate of the CSCE, not as a 
purely Russian army. 
  INTERFAX: Wouldn't you want to invite for talks the leaders 
of Karabakh regardless of Armenia? In that way it would 
probably be easier to agree... 
  Aliyev: I have many plans to this end. Probably, some of 
them will materialize. 
  INTERFAX: There is an opinion that the problem of Karabakh 
could be resolved through an exchange of territories with 
Armenia. How realistic would that be? 
  Aliyev: That is not a new idea, it is very old. In the past 
the late Andrey Sakharov came out with it. I was outside of 
political life then. It is hard to tell now how suitable the 
idea is. If the question arises again, it can be discussed. 
  INTERFAX: Our readers are quite interested in your attitude 
to relations with Russia. 
  Aliyev: I have nothing to complain about. For a time 
relations between Azerbaijan and Russia were quite cold and Baku 
was to blame for that. I felt that when I worked in 
Nakhichevan. My attitude to such a stance of the Azeri 
leadership was generally negative. Therefore when I was elected 
the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, in my very first speech I 
declared that the improvement of relations with Russia is one of 
the key tasks. 
  However, it was not easy for me to reach this aim. Once the 
Azeri parliament even blocked the question of the country's 
membership in the CIS. 
  I cannot say that the CIS is an organization that fully 
stands for its name: I felt that having attended three summits 
of the Commonwealth. Can it be normal that countries belonging 
to one association are in a state of war like Azerbaijan and 
Armenia? I suggested discussing the matter separately at a 
conference of CIS members, however, others evaded the matter. 
Therefore I cannot describe the efforts of the Commonwealth as 
satisfactory, still I am convinced that the organization is 
necessary. 
  INTERFAX: What are the priorities of Azerbaijan in foreign 
policy? 
  Aliyev: I am convinced that Azerbaijan should have equal, 
mutually-beneficial relations with all countries, primarily with 
its neighbors, of course. In the recent past Baku, and that is 
because of the country's leadership, had strained relations with 
our southern neighbor Iran with which we have a long frontier. 
Besides, many Azeris live there. I took steps to correct the 
mistake. Now relations between Azerbaijan and Iran are 
developing normally. 
  Speaking of relations with the West I want to say that I 
find 
them very important too. That is why I visited the NATO 
headquarters in Brussels and on April 4 signed the Partnership 
for Peace program. Firstly, it brings Azerbaijan closer to the 
Western world. Secondly, it creates conditions for more 
successful economic cooperation with countries of the North 
Atlantic Treaty. 
  INTERFAX: And the last question: how do you feel? 
  Aliyev: Very well. People surrounding me are much younger, 
but they find it hard to keep up with the pace of my work. That 
is what I can say.

  [Text] Odessa 16 June TASS -- Russo-Ukrainian relations are 
normal and from now on will be a top priority, they should be 
developed and reinforced in every way, President Leonid Kravchuk 
of Ukraine told a meeting of industrialists, agricultural 
workers, businessmen, students and representatives of various 
political parties and movements at the polytechnic university on 
Thursday. 
  As president, I will do my best to restore ties with the 
Russian Federation, to make them work both for Russia and 
Ukraine. 
  "Ukrainian president should protect interests of his 
country, 
and (president) of the Russian Federation -- those of his 
country. This is normal," Kravchuk emphasized. 
  Touching upon his relations with the newly elected Ukrainian 
Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol, Kravchuk described him as an 
educated and experienced person who has changed his views in 
many respects since his resignation. Judging by his programme 
presented to Ukrainian parliament, Masol has changed his 
approach to settling economic problems and sees clearly how to 
lead the country out of crisis. It is important now that Masol 
select a strong team and that nobody interfere with his work, 
Kravchuk said.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol to Supreme Council </F>
in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed chairman, esteemed president, esteemed 
people's deputies, esteemed citizens of Ukraine! First of all, 
I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all those 
people's deputies of Ukraine who supported me and voted to elect 
me to this honorable and very responsible post of prime minister 
of Ukraine. I would also like to thank those who did not vote 
for me today, and I hope we can cooperate together. I regard 
your considerable degree of support and trust as a pleasant sign 
of a certain solidarity in the deputy corps, as a sincere desire 
of the new Supreme Council deputies to unite in their 
intentions, efforts and practical actions toward joint work on 
solutions to acute economic problems facing our new independent 
state. I am convinced that each of us sitting in this chamber 
today is well aware that we are living and working in a time 
difficult for our homeland, and that the top legislative body 
and the government of the country are facing a huge 
responsibility to strengthen its statehood, sovereignty, to 
overcome the crisis in the economy, raise the living standards 
and improve the people's well- being. 
  It would not be an overstatement to say that we are living 
in 
a historic time, a time of choice and resolute action in the 
name of the Ukrainian people, in the name of the young 
independent Ukrainian state. I would like to assure you, 
esteemed people's deputies, in all frankness, that I am fully 
aware of the complexity of the economic and political situation 
in our country, and that I have a deep understanding of what a 
tangible moral burden, what a huge responsibility I am 
undertaking once I am elected prime minister of Ukraine. 
[sentence as heard] I hope I will have enough strength and 
experience to live up to your trust and the people's 
understandable expectations and high hopes that we can stop the 
country from sliding into an abyss and bring an improvement in 
the lives of our people. Of course, the success of the 
government that you have trusted me to head will considerably 
depend on the individuals who agree to work there, their level 
of competence and sense of responsibility. I would like it to 
be a government of like-minded professionals who will pursue 
modern economic views, stand firmly on a market platform, and 
who will be guided in their practical work by Ukraine's national 
interests, rather than their own, and will be beyond politics. 
In my understanding, economics is the highest form of politics 
for a government official of any level. At the same time, I 
fully understand that the political factor, the atmosphere 
around the government and society on the whole, must play an 
extremely important role in creating proper conditions for the 
revival of national economy and for its progress. In the past 
few years, we have seen for ourselves, in our experience and 
that of others, that deep economic reforms are impossible if 
there is no national concord, civic unity, and an atmosphere of 
understanding and full support for the government's economic 
policy in the society. 
  On this premise, I would like to propose that all political 
forces, millions working in various sectors of the national 
economy and all citizens of Ukraine refrain for a while from any 
destructive actions, by which I mean first of all strikes and 
other forms of stoppages in the production. It is particularly 
dangerous now in the coal industry and in the entire fuel and 
energy complex. Of course, we are not going to live in some 
conflict-free, totally peaceful society. But I am convinced 
that even in today's extreme situation all misunderstandings and 
contentious issues that may emerge can be solved in the course 
of work, by studying all the circumstances and negotiating, 
without resorting to extreme measures. 
  Our life and work will not be easy, because the crisis has 
not passed but continues to deepen, and its worst consequences 
are probably yet to come. We may be yet in store for an 
explosion, but the government must do everything in its power to 
minimize its socially negative consequences and prevent further 
economic destabilization in the country. Moreover, the Cabinet 
of Ministers, together with the parliament will take effective 
steps toward gradual improvement of the people's living 
standards, pay, pensions and social benefits. But all this will 
be done together with the livening up of production and an 
increase in the national income. Although the government will 
give unconditional priority to the social sphere, I believe that 
a change for the best in our life and stabilization of the 
economy will not begin until a year or a year and a half from 
now. I don't think we should make promises we cannot keep. 
  I have already said this, and I want to say again that we 
must create a government with full powers, with a genuine 
responsibility for the state of the economy. I proceed here 
from the fact that the competence and efficiency of any 
management structure primarily depends on how well the powers 
and responsibilities vested in it accord with its practical 
activities. There should be a clear and direct correlation. On 
this basis, I support the provisions of the draft law on 
amendments to the Constitution, which stipulates that the prime 
minister of the country must be head of executive power, 
personally accountable to the Supreme Council and the people for 
the implementation of the laws, resolutions and economic 
programs adopted and their social consequences. 
  We should say bluntly that today, with the existing split 
and 
duality in the executive power, our government does not have 
this status, and it cannot help but affect its efficiency. We 
must draw a clear and rational line between the functions and 
responsibilities of representative and executive bodies, of the 
center and the regions, giving local authorities powers to 
resolve all issues concerning local life, provided that they 
unconditionally support the overall state interests and preserve 
Ukraine's territorial integrity. We are in great need of a 
flexible and effective vertical power structure, without which a 
state cannot exist. We have certain intentions to that effect, 
and I hope that our parliament will come to an agreement on this 
important issue and will pass relevant laws. Using its right 
to initiate legislation, the government will be active in 
creating a reliable legal basis and preparing laws necessary to 
accelerate economic and political reforms. We must make 
relevant changes in some of the acting laws and as soon as 
possible renounce outdated legal acts which are slowing down the 
recovery of our economy and society on the whole. Undoubtedly, 
I am counting on joint constructive work with the parliament, 
its commissions and people's deputies. Of course, in the current 
situation, neither the government nor myself can count on any 
chance of quiet work in comfortable offices. I am not even 
thinking of that, but I do hope that the new Cabinet of 
Ministers will be given a chance to work fruitfully, fulfill its 
potential and do all in its power to improve our economic 
situation. During this work, I will always be ready to consider 
any anticrisis proposal from people's deputies, one which would 
be well-grounded, backed up by relevant economic calculations 
and offering positive consequences of its implementation. To 
that end, the doors of the Cabinet of Ministers will be open to 
anyone. But, on the contrary, I believe there is no need today 
to queue to the prime minister's office to beg or snatch 
something from the state treasury. Give us a chance to work, 
and if there is any emergency, we will see you. There is almost 
nothing left to hand out at the government level, and, moreover, 
in the market conditions that we are adopting the functions and 
powers of the government will be totally different. 
  In conclusion, esteemed people's deputies, allow me to 
express again my sincere and deep gratitude to all of you for 
the great deal of trust you have placed in me. Thank you for 
your attention.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol by </F>
Larisa Zhalovaga; place and date not given: "Vitaliy Masol: 
`If There Were Market Relations in Our Country, I Would Be an 
Independent Man Today'"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament is currently waiting for a 
new prime minister. Among the most probable candidates is 
Vitaliy Masol, former head of the government, who resigned from 
his post after the 1990 students demonstrations. It is quite 
possible that Masol's "second coming" to the Cabinet of 
Ministers will become a reality, since he enjoys support from 
the leftist majority in parliament. We present to our readers 
an interview with the candidate for prime minister by a 
KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI correspondent. 
  [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, what do you think of the 
prospect of again sitting in the prime minister's chair? 
  [Masol] If I am to work in the government, I should know 
that I will be supported by parliament, to avoid the following 
situation: I am appointed as head of the Cabinet of Ministers 
today, and tomorrow, I will be asked why the economic situation 
is still unstable. Stabilization will take place in neither 
three days nor a month. Thus, when the three main state 
officials live like a swan, crayfish, and pike in the same lake, 
I want to be neither a swan, nor a crayfish, nor a pike. 
Moreover, I am currently morally pleased that I had once 
properly assessed the situation. Three years have already 
passed, and these years have confirmed that my conclusions were 
correct. I said, and still say, that I very seldom make 
mistakes in my predictions. I was against the introduction of 
hard currency. Ukraine was not ready for that; we should have 
established a banking system first. People were shouting: 
"Conservative, Moscow's protege!" When I was saying that we 
should not break ties with Russia, no one believed me: "We are 
feeding Moscow!" Tell me what real grievances, regarding the 
economy, were presented against the Masol government in 1990? 
None. It was simply -- "Down with Masol!" 
  [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, the leftists have 
overwhelmed the new government. Will they be able to assume 
responsibility for forming the government? What kind of a 
government could there be? 
  [Masol] Personally, I would like very much that the leftists 
be able to form the cabinet. I would like that new 
politicians-realists appear, first of all, in the Executive 
Branch. In my opinion, among the recently elected deputies 
there are people who are able to soberly assess the situation 
and begin implementing reform. Regarding the leftists, they 
must establish a unified bloc with the centrists. They must 
cooperate to stabilize the economic situation. Decrees that 
have been blocking production must be rescinded, the system of 
taxation must be reformed, and the pricing mechanism must be 
altered. 
  [Zhalovaga] You were against shock therapy... 
  [Masol] We have not had shock therapy. We have had a 
stress-shock therapy, because no economic policy has been 
conducted. It was decided: "We will not meddle in the life of 
enterprises and kolkhozes. Do whatever you want to do." That 
was all. But first, there should be discipline and order in the 
state. How are you going to maintain and oversee them is 
another question. 
  [Zhalovaga] To which period of history can Ukraine's current 
situation be compared? 
  [Masol] I think that there have been no analogous situations 
in world history. It is simply ridiculous to compare today's 
Ukraine with postwar Germany -- these are two incomparable 
situations. Although we had relative wealth, we ended up in 
poverty. Currently, I am categorically against our heading 
toward poverty while promising wealth at the same time. I do 
not know how many years we need to reach the same volume of 
agricultural production as we had three years ago. 
  [Zhalovaga] So you believe that our country has its own way. 
How would you describe it? 
  [Masol] Russia was, is, and will remain for many years our 
primary market. No one will allow us to enter the West with our 
meat, milk, or butter. There are strict market relations. 
Fight. Ukraine is currently losing the Russian market, and at 
the same time, the West is conquering it. Plus, there has been 
a resolution to introduce customs duties! If Ukraine loses the 
Russian market, it will be very hard for us to survive, because 
the agricultural sector is a priority in our country. We were 
delivering a great volume of agricultural production to Russia, 
which was allowing us to pay for gas and oil deliveries. 
  [Zhalovaga] Vitaliy Andriyevych, would you like to be an 
owner? 
  [Masol] If there were market relations in our country, I 
would be, if not a rich man, at least not poor. I would be an 
independent man today.

  [Text] Poltava [no date as received] -- Ivan Plyushch, 
Ukrainian people's deputy, former speaker, and presidential 
candidate, replied to UNIAN's question at a news conference on 
16 June about his reaction to Vitaliy Masol's appointment as 
prime minister: "I spoke to Masol about a month ago or before, 
and he had a different attitude then. I do not know what 
pressure made Masol change his mind. I also do not know who 
needed to elect a prime minister 10 days before the presidential 
election, but I am not about to make a tragedy of this 
appointment. I know Masol as an experienced economist and 
statesman, and if I were to work with him, I think we would 
agree on a mutually complementary decision on this or that 
issue." 
  Asked by UNIAN to explain his differences with Leonid 
Kravchuk, recently coming to light in an ongoing indirect 
debate, Ivan Plyushch said: "I think Leonid Makarovych is the 
kind of politician who is very adept at adapting to public 
opinion. I believe a politician is a person who forms public 
opinion and leads it forward."

  [Text] Kiev, 16 June -- Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman 
has left for Simferopol. Mr. Moroz told UNIAN that the main 
purpose of his visit was to meet Crimean Supreme Council 
deputies. "The Crimean authorities' alienation from the center 
does not contribute to the settlement of Crimean problems," said 
the Supreme Council chairman. Considering the frequent bias in 
some of the media coverage of the Crimean issues as well as 
third party political manipulations "by Russia," Oleksandr Moroz 
plans personal meetings with Crimea's residents and labor 
collectives in person. There will be no time for a meeting with 
the Black Sea Fleet command, although the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council chairman said he was willing to hold one.

  [Text] We arrived here to fill the gap between the 
authorities of Kiev and Crimea, said Oleksandr Moroz, Supreme 
Council chairman of Ukraine, while speaking in the Crimean 
Supreme Council today. Our task, he pointed out, is to establish 
business and emotional contacts. However, we have prospects 
only on condition that we work in a single constitutional field, 
said Oleksandr Moroz. 
  According to the Ukrainian Supreme Council speaker, the 
aggravation of the situation in Crimea was caused not only by 
the local authorities' actions, but also by the mistakes made by 
the Kiev authorities. 
  Touching on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Oleksandr Moroz 
pointed out that this is a zone of special interest of Ukraine 
and Russia. In the opinion of Oleksandr Moroz, the Black Sea 
Fleet should be used jointly by both countries and it should 
have a joint command. However, the Supreme Council chairman 
pointed out, Ukraine and Russia should maintain and be in charge 
of their own parts of the fleet. 
  Oleksandr Moroz held a news conference for journalists 
during 
which he, in particular, spoke out against the federal system in 
Ukraine, saying that the time has not yet come for this.

  [Text] "We are again in the stage of struggling for an 
independent state. We are facing a Rubicon: Either for Ukraine 
or against it," this is how newly elected leader of the 
democratic association "Ukrayina" Dmytro Pavlychko characterized 
the present political situation in the country. He also pointed 
out that National Democrats are challenged by two main tasks: 
To see to it that representatives of anti-Ukrainian forces do 
not win in the presidential elections and to try and gain 
victory in the run-off elections of 112 Ukraine's people's 
deputies on 24 July 1994 in order at least to slightly change 
the alignment of political forces in the Supreme Council. 
According to D. Pavlychko, a coordination council of chairmen 
of political parties has already been created. However, it has 
not yet worked out a single approach as to whom of the 
presidential candidates to support, but has already resolved not 
to provide any support for the programs of [presidential 
candidates] L. Kuchma or O. Moroz. With regard to the run-off 
elections, said D. Pavlychko, 73 democratic candidates have been 
agreed upon and nominated. "It would be good if at least 
one-half of that number win," said the "Ukrayina" leader.

<F P=106> [Report by Serhiy Pavliv] </F>
  [Text] The second session of the opposition parliament, 
the Crimean Civil Council [HRK], took place in Simferopol on 5 
June. The Secretariat summed up the work carried out to organize 
the session. After that, its members reviewed events occurring 
over the two weeks since the last session. Among particular 
items discussed was a report released by UKRINFORM and picked up 
by Russia's Ostankino television and Mayak Radio regarding HRK 
activities allegedly directed at overthrowing the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet, which was labeled a provocation and as not 
corresponding with the truth. 
  "The goal of the Crimean Civil Council is to preserve 
Ukraine's territorial integrity, decisive resistance to 
chauvinist demands by Crimean separatists, and the resolution of 
a number of issues related to social, educational, and cultural 
problems of the Ukrainian community in the Crimea, as well as 
the problem of the deported nations -- not the struggle for 
power," states the report by the HRK Secretariat. 
  Participants in the session approved the time limit, formed 
the Presidium and several commissions, and appointed respective 
heads. 
  Serhiy Lytvyn was elected head of the Crimean Civil Council, 
while Oleksandr Kulyk, chief editor of KRYMSKA SVITLYTSYA 
[Crimean Room] newspaper and head of the National T.G. 
Shevchenko "Prosvita" Association, was appointed as his deputy. 
Also approved was the line-up of the following HRK commissions: 
for issues of national policies and deported nations; culture 
and education; mass media and public relations; and analytical 
and internal problems. 
  The session adopted an appeal to the electorate in 
connection 
with the presidential elections voicing support for L. Kravchuk 
and vowing a large-scale campaign against L. Kuchma and O. Moroz. 
  Members of the opposition parliament went home equipped with 
clear goals and plans regarding the explanation of HRK goals and 
rallying people in the hinterland who care about the Crimea as 
part of Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by G. Staroverov: "Russia Stretches Out Helpful </F>
Hand to Sevastopol"] 
  [Text] Upon his return from a trip to Moscow, Sevastopol 
City Council Chairman V.M. Semyonov held a press conference. He 
said that at present, Ukraine is not capable of providing 
subsidies to Sevastopol and that the goal of his trip was to 
ensure that the Russian budget finances the part of city's 
infrastructure and social sector that is connected with 
servicing the Black Sea Fleet (which represents about one-fourth 
of all expenditures in this sector). It is expected that 52-53 
billion rubles will be earmarked for this purpose. 
  This amount was announced during the last trip by V.M. 
Semyonov to Moscow, last April. At that time, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin jotted "Please take this into consideration when 
drafting the budget" on the written appeal. 
  Aid to Sevastopol should not be a one-shot deal, but 
permanent. This is Russia's duty, V.M. Semyonov stressed, 
because the Black Sea Fleet is, and will be, Russian with its 
base located in Sevastopol. 
  In Moscow, the mayor of Sevastopol reached an understanding 
with Russian Finance Minister Yuriy Dubinin and N. Gonchar, head 
of the commission for budget and currency regulation and tax 
policies in the Federation Council. Russia's budget 
participation and the financing of Sevastopol's needs will be 
conducted on the basis of interstate agreements. 
  In his report, V.M. Semyonov touched upon the mechanism for 
funneling funds from the Russian budget to Sevastopol. This 
issue was also discussed during his visit to Moscow. He held 
meetings with a number of leaders of large industrial companies 
and enterprises. In particular, interest in Sevastopol was 
expressed by one science and production amalgamation from the 
machine-building industry, also known as the major enterprise 
manufacturing "Proton" carrier rockets, "Polet" satellites, and 
"Salut" and "Almaz" space stations. It proposed to use 
high-technology developments in the manufacturing of solar 
energy collectors and generators, as well as water purification 
equipment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Nikulin by N. Gavrileva; place and </F>
date not given: "Rossiya Will Not Depart From Its Program"] 
  [Text] Quite a pile of material, in which people ask to one 
extent or another what has happened to the Rossiya bloc, why has 
it become virtually in opposition to the president, and much 
else, has accumulated at the newspaper recently. We put these 
questions to Sergey Nikulin, Rossiya faction chairman. 
  [Gavrileva] So what has happened to the Rossiya bloc since 
the elections? People say that it has ceased to exist.... 
  [Nikulin] Truly, the bloc did end its existence 
simultaneously with the conclusion of the elections to the 
Supreme Soviet--this is legally unexceptionable and should not 
be a cause for any concern. But the bloc's traditions and 
continuity have been preserved in the Rossiya faction, which has 
absorbed almost all the supporters of this election bloc--more 
than 40 persons; they are united by its program. Please recall 
that it is based on the program of the Crimea Republican Party, 
(Crimea republican movement), the party that secured election 
victory for the president and deputies of the Supreme Soviet. 
  [Gavrileva] But, at a news conference the Respublika faction 
declared that you had departed somewhat from the joint election 
program and, how to put this as gently as possible, that you 
observe somewhat different moral principles.... 
  [Nikulin] As far as the program is concerned, let anyone 
find 
even one insignificant clause in which this has been manifested. 
For example, we spoke to our electorate about the restoration of 
the constitution of 6 May, it was done, it was restored. We 
spoke about the protection of Crimean conscripts--it was done, 
the law on the service of Crimeans in Crimea--it was adopted. We 
spoke about privileges for needy families--a decree on the 
cancellation of VAT on children's passes was adopted. I could 
continue.... 
  [Gavrileva] Enough for the time being, time is clearly 
short.... 
  [Nikulin] As far as moral principles are concerned.... It is 
sufficient to hear how representatives of the Respublika faction 
behave at plenary meetings--they have not submitted a single 
constructive proposal, everything is geared to destructiveness 
according to the principle of the worse, the better. I, truly, 
cannot recall a serviceable proposal coming from this group. 
  [Gavrileva] Please explain, if possible, the faction's 
position in regard to parliament's relationship with the 
president's team. 
  [Nikulin] Let us begin with the fact that the contradictions 
between the president's team and the Supreme Soviet are clearly 
exaggerated--there are certain forces in Crimea and outside that 
are endeavoring to split the two branches of power--this is 
really in vogue, note, and not only here in Crimea. 
  An attempt was made to accuse the leaders of the Rossiya 
faction and the Republican Party of an endeavor to push through 
"their" people into government. For heaven's sake, the 
Republican Party is the victorious party, and throughout the 
civilized world it is the victorious parties that form the 
government. It was assumed that this was how it would be with us 
also. This is a normal process. We have a fine team and the most 
experienced and professional specialists of all sectors of the 
economy. The list by which Mr. Saburov and MESHCHANSKAYA GAZETA 
attempted to put us to shame was prepared by us at the behest of 
the president of the Republic of Crimea and Sergey Pavlovich 
Tsekov (at that time still simply leader of the party) and at 
the request of V. Minin, leader of the Office for Public 
Administration. So these are not "our" people, if by this is 
implied people selected according to the principle of nepotism 
and family relationships, but the people of the president of the 
Republic of Crimea, who secured his dazzling victory at the 
presidential elections and who are recognized specialists in 
their fields. We should be speaking today, rather, about the 
others being appointed as a counterweight to our proposals and 
according to the principles mentioned above, what is more. 
  Nonetheless, I have complete confidence that the government 
will treat our recommendations correctly because we have already 
shown our competency in the building of the statehood of the 
Republic of Crimea. 
  But I see nothing extraordinary in the events connected with 
the situation surrounding the government: The normal mutual 
adaptation of two branches of power only just recognized and 
supported by the people is taking place. And inappropriate 
emotions should not be added to this. 
  [Gavrileva] Sergey Vladimirovich, what can you say about the 
fact that both in our editorial mail and in telegrams to the 
Supreme Soviet your faction virtually is being accused of 
betrayal of the president? 
  [Nikulin] Moreover, we are being accused of having been 
elected to the Supreme Soviet on an oath of loyalty to the 
president and of not fulfilling it! But let us take these things 
in order. We have supported the president in all his 
undertakings, except for his being granted decree-issuing 
authority: We believe that it is necessary to operate not from 
the position of a state of emergency but on the basis of a 
profoundly calibrated and practicable plan. It was this plan 
that we wanted to hear from Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov 
and his ministers. It is not our fault (or misfortune) but 
theirs that they were unable to present it to the Supreme 
Soviet, and this is why additional time for the conclusive 
formulation of their intention was determined. Nonetheless, 
those whom the president has proposed have been appointed 
ministers, and as quickly as possible, what is more. 
  And apropos the "oath of loyalty" I will say that the same 
"oath" was given by the president of the Republican Party to the 
Rossiya bloc--this oath being the actual program of the bloc, 
which both we and the president intend to fulfill.

<F P=106> [Speech by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz at the </F>
Ukrainian Supreme Council in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Today, we are supposed to examine the issue that 
concerns the main principles of the directions of establishing 
Ukraine's economy in the period of crisis. The establishment of 
Ukraine as an independent and sovereign state is only possible 
under conditions of a reliably functioning economy. It should 
be based on an integral and effective economic system. It is 
promoting the creation of this economic system that these main 
principles, as the legal basis of (strengthening) control of the 
economy by the state, are called upon. The methodological 
approaches that the main principles are based on envisage a 
systematic and comprehensive nature of setting up the state 
regulation of the economy, taking account of its organic 
synthesis with market regulators and the developed countries' 
postwar historic experience of overcoming crisis. The main 
principles originate from objectively analyzing the cause, 
nature, and scale of the systemic crisis in Ukraine and the 
persistently continuing trend of its deterioration. After two 
years, state authorities have failed to make effective use of 
Ukraine's high scientific and technological level, rich land 
resources, and its people's great industriousness. 
  The analysis shows that the state of the economy endangers 
Ukraine's sovereignty. Large-scale deindustrialization of the 
economy is being carried out, with hi-tech industries degrading 
most of all. The average annual rate of the decline in the 
production sphere is more than 13 percent, and almost 30 percent 
over the first six months of this year. The production indices 
have decreased by 50 percent as far as the 50 most important 
kinds of products are concerned. Construction has been sharply 
curtailed. The average annual decline in agricultural 
production exceeded 18 percent. As to the consumption of animal 
husbandry products, Ukraine has been thrown back 30 years. As 
compared with the developed countries, the production of meat, 
milk, and eggs per capita amounts to only 60 percent. 
  The main causes of the crisis are the absence of a clear-cut 
political and socioeconomic strategy of Ukraine's development, 
the chaotic destruction of the planned-administrative system of 
management without it being adequately replaced by the market 
mechanisms and infrastructure, the collapse of the USSR 
national-economic complex, and the fact that the mechanisms of 
Ukraine's independent economy functioning have not been formed, 
distorted formation of a market economy by means of a mechanical 
implantation of the other countries' experience in the national 
soil, ill-considered liberalization of prices and foreign 
economic activity and privatization, boosted by the inadequacy 
of the legal basis and the absence of a reliable state 
regulation, the unskillful sale and appropriation of national 
property, penetration of crime elements into the economic 
activity, partial merger of the state apparatus with the shadow 
structures, absence of an economic mechanism of the mixed 
economy functioning, groundless hopes that in conditions of a 
transition toward market economy the state alienates itself from 
the economy. [passage omitted] 
  I believe that the state withdrawing from control over the 
economy and the role of market self-regulation being 
groundlessly exaggerated in the economic policy of Ukraine's 
power structures, were some of the main causes of the economic 
crisis. The main principles make provision for the necessary 
adjustments in the government's actions in order to establish 
the optimal ratio between state and market regulators in the 
economic system. 
  The aims and sequence of state regulation are as follows: 
The main and the nearest objective of the state control over 
the economy, which is determined by the main principles, is to 
stop the crisis and stabilize the socioeconomic situation in 
Ukraine. The strategic objective of the socioeconomic 
transformations in all spheres of life is to bring Ukraine to 
the way of building a society of progressive development with 
the state being subordinated to citizens's interests in real 
terms. 
  Generally speaking, in terms of economy this means the 
creation of highly developed production, financial, scientific 
and technical infrastructure of Ukraine's economy, ensuring 
highly technological energy and resources-saving and 
ecologically safe development of all its industries and their 
competitiveness on the world market, ensuring Ukraine's 
accession to the world community on an equal footing with other 
states. 
  As far as the protection of the state is concerned, the 
objective is to ensure the high enough military might of the 
country and the ability to protect and defend its territorial 
integrity and national interests. 
  In the social and cultural spheres the objective is to 
ensure 
the modernization of the high scientific and technical level of 
production, consolidation of the positions of Ukraine's science 
in the world on the basis of raising the general education level 
of citizens, guaranteeing possibilities for them to receive 
proper education and qualification, creating conditions for the 
all-round development of all the branches of culture, 
literature, and the arts, multiplying the features of high 
spirituality inherent in the people of Ukraine. [passage 
omitted] 
  The socioeconomic transformations will be implemented in 
three stages. A considerable part of the tasks, envisaged at 
these stages, will be simultaneous, i.e. will coincide and be 
held as a set. 
  The first stage is the determination of the state 
priorities and mechanisms to ensure them, a gradual transfer 
from chaotic economic relations to regulated market relations. 
The task of this stage is to stop the decline in production and 
begin to raise it, stabilization and implementation of an 
effective employment program. During the first stage it is 
envisaged to create by the end of 1995 favorable economic 
conditions for the effective industries and enterprises of all 
forms of ownership that determine the economic potential of the 
state. At the same time production units lacking prospects will 
be closed down gradually, with those employed at these 
production units being socially protected. [passage omitted] 
  The second stage is stabilization. At this stage a reliable 
stabilization of production is achieved approximately by the end 
of 1997. A gradual increase in output begins. At the end of 
this stage the output of industrial and agricultural products, 
most probably excluding animal husbandry products, should reach 
the level of the late 1980's, with the improved structure of 
these products and their significantly higher quality. During 
this time it is necessary to create the required industrial 
capacities to ensure the priority trends in the development of 
the economy, especially for agriculture and the processing 
industry, to stimulate an increase in the volume of capital 
construction and modernization of enterprises, housing 
construction, the development of the social and market 
infrastructure with conditions being created for the involvement 
of the money of the enterprises that do not belong to the state. 
[passage omitted] 
  The third stage is socioeconomic growth. The effective 
implementation of the tasks of the first two stages should 
create a reliable basis for the country's entry to the next 
stage of the socioeconomic development. In general terms, its 
main task is to complete the structural reorganization, to form 
an effective, competitive, socially-oriented market economy, 
develop and introduce the world standard technologies along the 
main trends of the scientific and technical progress, to bring 
the Ukrainian citizens' living standards closer to the level of 
the industrially developed countries. 
  The main prerequisites of state regulation policy are these: 
  Laying the main foundation of state regulation in the 
economy 
must take account of certain social, political, and 
organizational conditions of principal importance. Among them 
the category of social conditions should include such areas as 
the social security of the population, maintenance of its living 
standards at a level no lower than the poverty line, and 
provision for constitutional and social guarantees of this. The 
political conditions are state independence, international 
cooperation, and good-neighborliness, developing democracy and 
self-government, strengthening society's legal basis, and 
political accord in society. The organizational and economic 
conditions are ensuring the stability of the economic system, 
averting shock methods in economic transformation, supporting 
economic, scientific and technological priorities, stopping the 
fall and ensuring an increase in the productivity of 
agriculture, and production in society in general. 
  The state management of the economy must be carried out 
comprehensively and extend to all spheres of production in 
society, i.e. production proper, distributive relations, the 
sphere of monetary circulation and eventual consumption. 
  Let us look at the directions and methods of influencing 
economic development. The menacing depth of the crisis requires 
the lack of state control over the main economic processes in 
Ukraine to be ended. The effectiveness of the following changes 
depends upon the precision of the steps opted for at the first 
stage. It is exactly these steps that the document focuses on. 
  The aim and form of implementing structural changes is as 
follows: 
  The main form of making structural changes is a policy of 
state priorities based on drawing up national programs and the 
state stimulating them. The aim of the state priorities policy 
is supporting the quicker development of the national economy 
industries and enterprises manufacturing competitive goods of 
priority importance. 
  One should remember that the real state of Ukraine's economy 
in the past and at present, its unique level of concentration 
and integration with neighboring countries, combined with the 
incomplete technological cycles, naturally requires the use of 
large-scale (organizational) and economic formations, including 
between industries, functioning on the basis of diverse forms of 
ownership and up-to-date scientific and technological policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  Ensuring a balanced development of regions, with their 
speciality and orientation taken into consideration; overcoming 
structural deformations, which of late have become worse and, 
under these conditions, Ukraine retaining productivity; 
organizing effective cooperation in production between 
enterprises and industries within Ukraine, and restoring the 
necessary economic ties within the framework of the CIS and with 
other world countries, and establishing new relations. 
  The policy of restructuring must be consistent and gradual 
and make use of pin-point investment; (a new type of) 
cooperation between enterprises, targeting complete 
technological cycles within the state; institution of national 
and transnational companies on the basis of various forms of 
ownership; competition between enterprises of raw materials and 
semi-raw material industries, on the one hand, and machine 
building industries, including those with the participation of 
foreign investors, on the other; diversification of industries 
and (purposeful) programs of restructuring; and gradual shutdown 
of unproductive enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  Provision is made for transforming facilities, and, at the 
same time, forming a normative basis to restructure the 
machine-building complex in order for it to manufacture 
components for common use in industry, agriculture, and 
processing; and ensuring a rise in the volumes of enterprises' 
reconstruction, housing construction, and the social 
infrastructure. [passage omitted] 
  In view of Ukraine's economic, scientific, and technological 
potential, the needs of its population and the task of entering 
the world market, the following industries should be identified 
as a matter of priority at the first stage of restructuring: 
These are agriculture and the processing industry, the fuel and 
energy complex, industries making extensive use of science and 
capital construction, including housing construction. 
  Taking account of world competition and social orientation 
of 
consumer goods -- I emphasize consumer goods -- and food, 
agriculture, regardless of its forms of ownership, is heading 
for specialization and greater industrialization by way of 
developing the sphere of the agro-industrial complex, 
preserving, processing and selling produce, thus stimulating 
production in low-cost production regions. 
  To that end, the structure of agro-industrial production in 
Ukraine should be optimized. 
  At issue is a really complex and topical task. In 
particular, the structure of grain production should be revised, 
not only from the viewpoint of (requirement by) agro-industrial 
complex industries but also from the standpoint of its energy 
consumption. [passage omitted] 
  This task [optimization of agricultural production] is also 
important because agricultural production and rural areas in 
general -- on the basis of the mentality of the people and the 
traditional system of family life -- recreate the sources of the 
viability of society and the state, and improve the demographic 
situation. 
  This was addressed the other day at a meeting with the 
leadership of the city of Kiev, and the conclusion that is being 
made today by local authorities is that resolving the housing 
problem by the methods used before has no future. So, individual 
construction should be more widespread. To put it rudely, 
people should be sat on the land and given an opportunity 
themselves to resolve this problem. 
  The formation of energy policy comprises measures on energy 
saving and the wider-ranging use of renewable energy carrier 
sources. At issue is liberating the agro-industrial complex 
from its energy dependence primarily upon, indirectly, Russia. 
  The development of industries making extensive use of 
science 
is based on the experience of world trends, Ukraine's 
achievements and possibilities, the state's strategy and 
scientific and technological policy being determined. 
  The development of general machine-building industries, 
adapted to world standards, is acquiring particular 
significance, of which I have already spoken. [passage omitted] 
  As for reforming ownership and privatization relations, the 
implementation of privatization must make provision for setting 
up a mixed economy in Ukraine, with the economy's state and 
nonstate sectors clearly delimited; legislatively distinguishing 
the state-owned industries and facilities forming the foundation 
of Ukraine's economy and economic security and not subject to 
privatization; safeguarding the interests of large and 
medium-size enterprises and protecting them from their ruination 
as integral property complexes; and privatizing social 
infrastructure enterprises and facilities, with their profile 
and jobs retained. [passage omitted] 
  Provision is made for regulating a mechanism for the 
workforce to exercise its priority to choose a form of 
privatization and ensure its implementation at the same time as 
ensuring the principle of all Ukrainian citizens' equal access 
to property; determining conditions for foreign capital to 
participate in privatization processes and the methodology of 
assessing the market value of facilities being privatized, with 
account taken of inflationary processes; the state mandatorily 
supervising the privatization of state property; legislatively 
determining a procedure of receiving earnings from privatization 
and ways of using them. [passage omitted] 
  Provision is also made for settling the issues of social 
security of those working at the facilities being privatized; 
improving the methods of assessment and control of the 
legitimacy of the privatization processes; a possibility of 
privatizing state and municipal property with the guaranteed use 
of all the privatization papers by the workers engaged in the 
budget-supported sphere, pensioners, youths, as well as 
compensation with the state property of the citizens' indexed 
deposits in the savings bank, with their consent; liquidating 
opportunities for corruption and uncontrolled privatization. 
[passage omitted] 
  The right to private ownership of land is granted by way of 
privatizing plots of land to be used as personal subsidiary 
farms or gardens, for individual housing construction or for the 
construction of garages, with the right of buying and selling 
the above plots of land. The right to private ownership of land 
is granted to the citizens of Ukraine only. Land can be 
provided to foreign legal and natural persons and to persons 
without citizenship for use only, including the use of land on 
conditions of a lease and, first and foremost, on conditions of 
a long lease. 
  Farmers use land for their production needs on condition of 
a 
long hereditary lease or under condition that the land will be 
sold to the state, as is being done in the majority of countries. 
  The right of citizens to housing is ensured through the 
privatization of the apartments belonging to the state housing 
fund and accelerated cooperative and individual construction of 
housing. [passage omitted] 
  As for the state regulation of economic processes, it, as a 
rule, has to do with price formation, the finance and credit 
policy, the taxation, credit, budget, currency, and wage 
policies, regulation of investments, scientific and technical 
policy, and foreign economic activity. Let us look at each of 
them in turn. 
  Pricing: The state policy is to stop the chaos in price 
formation, to take measures to stimulate [as heard] the price 
rise and achieve stabilization of prices, to remove distortions 
within the price system so that prices could become a 
stimulating regulator of production, registration and 
consumption of goods and services. The pricing policy must 
ensure support for an intersector pricing parity, particularly 
between agriculture and other sectors; and a close connection 
between prices and tariffs on the most important goods and 
services, on the one hand, and the level of the minimum pay and 
pensions, on the other. The regulation of prices for consumer 
goods should be effected through the margin of profit and the 
size of trade brokerage mark-ups, acknowledging the need to 
reduce superfluous brokerage operations and, probably, 
superfluous brokerage structures. 
  Financial, credit, and taxation policy: Reforming the 
taxation system in Ukraine must aim to stimulate the development 
of the national economy, increase the gross output, form a fully 
fledged budget, and settle social issues. 
  Profit, land, immovable property, and citizens' incomes 
should be liable to taxation. The tax rates should be 
substantiated. It is envisaged to improve the mechanism of the 
annual declaration of incomes by all the subjects of taxation, 
carry out strict control and step up responsibility for the 
fullness of the taxes paid by all the legal and natural persons. 
  Credit policy: Credit policy is to be aimed at creating 
favorable economic conditions for the effective use of the 
credit resources, the acceleration of the structural 
reorganization of the economy and its social orientation. 
[passage omitted] 
  The population's deposits should be index-linked in line 
with 
the actual rates of inflation. They could be further used as 
additional means for the privatization of property or returned 
on another basis, which is to be stipulated by law. At any 
rate, it seems to me the time has come to turn to using 
citizens' funds in deposits, which will act as deposit accounts. 
Otherwise, we will never be able to protect the citizens from a 
loss of their savings or restore their trust in the state. 
  Strict economic sanctions should be introduced for delays in 
payment for the products delivered, work performed, and services 
provided. A mechanism of control by the National Bank over the 
policy of interest rates should be worked out. Commercial banks 
should -- in economic terms -- be made more interested in 
crediting priority industries and the sphere of production by 
way of reducing the rates of payments to the budget as taxes on 
their incomes from such crediting. 
  Separately, there is the issue of commercial banks in 
general. They are now in a state of anxiety, caused, on the one 
hand, by the uncertainty as to what the attitude of the 
legislature and authorities as a whole toward their fate will 
be, i.e. whether they will be somehow oppressed and so on; and, 
on the other, by the impossibility of investing the colossal 
monetary resources they are sitting on, because what is in fact 
happening is that they are looking to inflationary processes in 
expectation of another round of inflation so that money could 
then produce more money, which mechanism is now well-known to 
everybody. 
  Everything possible should be made to involve the credit 
resources, the possibilities of commercial banks in the 
production sphere, to make them finance production, provide 
people with jobs, ensure the profitability of production and 
therefore, consolidate and stabilize the finances in the state 
and the budget in particular. 
  We should set up special funds within the state budget to 
provide credits and finances for priority industries by means of 
state contract and state order, which above all concerns 
agricultural produce and raw materials; and increase state 
control and the responsibility of the National Bank and 
commercial banks to ensure that credits are used for the purpose 
intended. [passage omitted: Moroz emphasizing the need for the 
Supreme Council budgetary commission to establish greater 
control over credits to prevent their misuse] 
  Budgetary policy: In budgetary policy, the state's actions 
should be focused on rationally using budgetary funds, combined 
with stimulating a reduction in the deficit. Increasing the 
budget revenues should be based on an (effective) taxation and 
tax collection system at the same time as essentially reducing 
concessions in taxation and issuing state securities to cover 
the budget deficit etc. Decreasing budgetary expenditure must 
be achieved by reducing the cost of maintaining the state 
government apparatus, transferring many of its structures to the 
system of profit and loss management, stopping subsidies to 
loss-making -- and I would like to emphasize loss-making through 
no fault of the state -- enterprises and stopping financing 
capital investment in the production that has no future. 
  The use of social programs funds for the purpose intended 
and 
the correspondence of budgetary allocations to social norms 
should be monitored more closely. 
  Also, our foreign trade deficit should be eliminated and the 
state's debt reduced by stimulating export and optimizing import. 
  It is envisaged that the stability of the financial system 
will be improved through strictly delimiting the state and local 
budgets and the budgets of state enterprises. This can also be 
viewed as a way toward the regionalization of the economy. 
  Currency regulation: At the first stage it is necessary to 
set the exchange rate of the national currency in relation to 
hard currencies and to the ruble proceeding from the real 
purchasing capacity of the currency. I would only make one 
remark at this point. It is necessary to stop using the Russian 
ruble as an oil- ruble, because this will finally destroy our 
economy. This distorts the entire price policy and all economic 
relations as a whole. 
  It is necessary to regulate the circulation of foreign 
currencies on Ukraine's territory ensuring the exchange of 
currencies through banks and their representatives only, and 
this can be done immediately without waiting for any special 
conditions. 
  The system of registration and constant control over 
currency 
circulation should be sorted out, strengthening its normative 
and legislative basis and stimulating the use of currency for 
the purpose intended and ending the granting of concessions to 
enterprises in terms of their currency relations with the 
budget. A tax on earnings in currency or the sale of 100 
percent of it should be introduced. 
  At present, 50 percent are sold at a fixed exchange rate and 
even through the mechanism of tenders -- which seems to be 
necessary for the state as it has to control and concentrate 
currency -- however, this undermines the interest of the 
commodity producers in export activities and, generally 
speaking, their earnings in currency only result in losses. I 
believe, this must be radically changed. 
  Forming the appropriate stabilization fund is a prerequisite 
of carrying out a monetary reform. 
  Wages and incomes policy: A state policy in the sphere of 
labor and wages will presuppose that the minimum wage at 
enterprises of all forms of ownership cannot be lower than the 
minimum subsistence level. We are not publishing any data on 
the consumer basket anywhere today because it will only confirm 
that we will not be able to provide anything for that basket. 
In the deputy prime minister's speech and questions yesterday 
[14 June], the opinion was voiced that it looked as though the 
economy was stabilizing. All earnings of citizens today, 
however, are in fact being used to procure food, which is the 
first sign of the population's total impoverishment. 
  Pay should be regulated by the state by way of developing 
recommended differentiated ratios between wage rates, salaries 
of the post, and certain additional payments, taking account of 
the conditions and complexity of labor affecting the cost price 
of products. 
  Bonuses and additional payments at enterprises of all forms 
of ownership are to be paid from the profit made without 
limitations, after the production funds, required by them, are 
formed. This must stimulate conscientious, inspired labor. 
  A mechanism of monthly index-linked wages and payments 
according to the level of inflation is being worked out. 
Conditions for a changeover to paying wages and salaries weekly 
are being prepared. Here, strictly speaking, we are talking 
about the implementation of the law on index-linking wages that 
was already passed. 
  The tariff system of a directive nature is (becoming more 
widespread). It is regarded as a reference point for the 
intersector and interqualificational differentiation of pay, 
except, certainly, for the budget-supported sphere. 
  Investment policy: The main objective of the state's 
investment policy, at the first stage, is to channel resources 
to developing and setting up production, above all in priority 
industries, at enterprises manufacturing competitive goods, 
which would be needed by the consumer. 
  I would like to underline here that we previously, in the 
past months, made a mistake in concentrating on support for 
products that would be competitive on the external market. What 
we need to do is to focus our attention on protecting the 
producer supplying goods to the internal market. [passage 
omitted] 
  The main sources for financing city investment projects 
should be state, enterprises', and the people's funds. With the 
aim of stimulating investment activity, a mechanism of 
encouraging a mixed form of financing investments should be 
elaborated that would include foreign investments and they 
should be protected from inflation. The state, first and 
foremost, promotes foreign investments that are directed at 
manufacturing, construction, and agriculture. [passage omitted] 
  Scientific and technical policy. At the first stage the 
state should direct its efforts at overcoming the innovation 
inertia of enterprises. To do this it is necessary to 
considerably increase state support and improve the economic 
mechanism of managing scientific and technical progress in all 
stages. It is necessary to envisage the creation of an 
integrated system of stimulating innovation activity by 
corporate bodies. The financing of scientific programs should 
be carried out on a competitive basis. It is necessary to carry 
out an inventory of all of Ukraine's scientific potential, renew 
scientific schools in the main areas of science and technology. 
[passage omitted] 
  Foreign economic activity. With the aim of state 
regulation of foreign economic activity, it is necessary to 
regulate the system of control in the following areas: To 
ensure the timely receipt of hard currency earnings and payment 
of customs duties, taxes, and other payments that would benefit 
the state. It is necessary to guarantee state control over the 
quality of imported goods and that they comply with 
international standards. It is necessary to ensure that all 
corporate bodies fully abide by the hard currency regulation. 
It is necessary to stimulate an export hard currency policy and 
create a reliable mechanism for protecting and forming an 
internal market. It is necessary to argue for critical imports 
and to protect the domestic producer from imports that could be 
manufactured in Ukraine. [passage omitted] 
  Regulation in the sphere of consumption. The main criterion 
for the state regulation in the economy should be to raise the 
living standard of the people of Ukraine as well as to increase 
the population's consumption of goods and services. The main 
principles envisage defining the subsistence level based on the 
people's minimum necessary requirements and on the possibilities 
of fulfilling them in the present phase. The legally fixed 
minimum consumer budget is guaranteed by the state and is 
reviewed with the purpose of increasing it in accordance with 
the improving economic situation in Ukraine. The state 
guarantees the legislative regulation of protecting consumer 
rights, promotes the involvement of a broad mass of the public 
in carrying out public control over maintaining legislative 
demands with regard to prices, the range of products, their 
quality, and the terms on which they are offered for sale and so 
on. We are talking about control over the organization of 
imports so that we do not have the situation that we have today. 
I will not talk about this phenomenon. 
  The state's stimulation of increasing mass demand and 
consumption is an absolute precondition for raising production, 
successfully overcoming the crisis and laying the foundations of 
the principles of Ukraine's national economy. The strategy of 
legal policy with regard to stabilizing the development of 
Ukraine's economy is closely intertwined with these tasks and is 
precisely the subject of our activity. For this reason, I will 
dwell in greater detail on this section. 
  The legal policy in the formation of a new stage in 
Ukraine's 
statehood is based on the principles of its economic 
independence. Politically and legally it is fixed in the 
declaration of state sovereignty of Ukraine, which announced 
that the policy of the legal act was approved by the people at a 
referendum and cannot be abolished. 
  In spite of this, instead of introducing the necessary 
changes to the basic law of Ukraine in October 1990, a law on 
suspending the activity of 19 articles of the Constitution was 
adopted, Section II, Articles 16 and 17 with regard to the 
basics of Ukraine's economic system, the legal regime for forms 
of ownership, the constitutional guarantee of citizens on 
sources of their well-being through socially useful work, a 
planned economic and social development of society, forming 
Ukraine's state budget. [passage omitted] 
  The main aim for a strategy of legal policy is to guarantee 
state regulation of economic relations in the state sector, a 
parallel implementation of legal reform to formulate a mixed 
economy; the creation of a legal base for regulating the 
activity of various corporate entities that compete with each 
other and that have diverse forms of ownership, the consistent 
and legal guarantee of the state market regulation of the market 
with its social orientation. The realization of the strategy of 
the legal policy and carrying out reforms is directed at an 
effective use of actions, object economic laws in an optimal 
ratio of various forms of ownership and later the growth in 
production with a view to the stage-by-stage introduction of a 
mixed economy. In order to implement these stages it is 
envisaged: 
  To repeal the law on suspending the activity of Section 2, 
16, and 17 of Ukraine's constitution and the corresponding 
introduction of changes and additions; to firmly strengthen the 
equality of all forms of ownership -- state, collective, 
private; to regulate legislation and to guarantee the 
accessibility of law-abiding acts; to improve adopted laws, to 
review first generation market legislation that cause discord in 
the market today; to complete the organizational and legal 
building; to form an institution of legislation and so on. 
[passage omitted] 
  The legal methods of ensuring stabilization of the 
development of the economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to adopt 
the following: Codifying economic legislation as one of the main 
ones with which to legally regulate the economy; liquidating the 
heritage of the administrative-command system, which is based on 
various instructions and legal acts; using agreements in various 
spheres of the economy and promoting socially useful 
entrepreneurship, and improving the structures of legislation 
and maintaining the hierarchy of legally binding acts, using 
contracts in various spheres of the economy and promoting 
socially useful business activity, and improving legislative 
structures. The key problem was building a model of a new 
constitution for Ukraine and the move away from the concept of 
the new constitution adopted in June 1992, and also abolishing 
the constitutional regulation of the economy on the part of the 
state, the establishment of democracy, the protection of human 
rights, free education, health-care, social guarantees, and the 
formation of economic conditions for the people's well-being. 
[passage omitted] 
  Apart from adopting a new constitution, it is expected to 
complete work on Ukraine's civil and criminal procedure, and 
trade codes, as well as on various other administrative codes 
and on the issue of the military and Ukraine's national defense. 
Particular attention should be paid to corporate bodies; the 
procedure for destatifying ownership, legislation on foreign 
investments; on privatization; on securities and the stock 
exchange; on banking activity; intellectual property on 
stimulation of production through taxation; assets funds; 
transport and customs legislation. 
  The carrying out of measures envisaged by this document 
envisions a sharp increase in the responsibility of officials 
who break the law. 
  A real fight against organized crime, corruption, and the 
shadow economy is envisaged. We are talking about a certain 
purge of the apparatus depending on the current demands and the 
specifics of the situation in the economy. It is time to renew 
state control for using state property, rationalizing 
privatization, and subordinating it to criteria of economic 
effectiveness. Increasing state discipline and bringing order 
to all spheres of social life does not necessarily mean 
increasing control over the actions of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
It should have the freedom of actions as defined by the law. 
  The Supreme Council together with the higher level executive 
structures should take upon themselves the responsibility for 
carrying out the stabilization of the economy and are obliged to 
speed up the creation of a system of legal instruments to adapt 
civilian and economic legal norms, the taxation and budgetary 
systems, state regulation, and supporting economic activity in 
order to legally guarantee a normal economic environment that 
would motivate productive work by all participants in the 
process of production, distribution, and consumption. This is 
the main content of the basic principles, which is being 
proposed for your attention. [passage omitted] 
  I would just like to stress one more thing. We, the Supreme 
Council, will use our constitutional right to confirm the 
candidate for the post of prime minister, which will be proposed 
by the president, and we should also proceed on the basis to 
what extent he agrees with such an economic policy. At the same 
time we should divide the responsibility for implementing this 
policy between the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the 
Supreme Council. I think that such an approach is also expected 
by the electorate because they do not divide the authority of 
deputies, members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, and 
the president. You are in the constituencies and therefore, you 
are responsible for it. Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] At the beginning of June, 101,500 unemployed with 
the corresponding status were registered in Ukraine. This means 
that, over a five month period, their number has increased by 
18,500 persons, and Ukraine feels confident to be among those 
European countries, which enjoy the lowest level of unemployment. 
  At the same time, the Ministry of Statistics maintains that 
about 2.5 million actually jobless citizens do not have official

<F P=106> ["Statement Adopted by the Meeting of the Organization of </F>
Ukraine's Idealists"; place and date not given: "They Do Not 
and Will Not Succeed"] 
  [Text] The situation in the Crimea was created 
artificially. It was instigated by secret "activists," who, by 
stirring up interethnic conflicts, in particular, between 
Russians and Ukrainians, are trying to accomplish their hidden 
plans. We know well who (at any rate, during World War II) 
dreamed about an "autonomous republic" in the Crimea. It would 
be an illusion to see the present situation on the peninsula 
outside the context of those dreams. To push the two great 
peoples -- Ukrainians and Russians -- into a confrontation and 
gain from that -- these are the schemes of internationalists 
hiding the signboard of the Meshkov [Crimean president] quandary. 
  They do not and will not succeed. 
  Every Cossack, who arrived from Don, Kuban, or other places 
to give support to the president of cossack extraction, must 
know that he is fulfilling the role of that proletarian, who, in 
1917, brought to power the Marxist-Leninist mafia, which then 
drew the peoples of the czarist empire into the terrible turmoil 
of self-destruction -- terror, civil wars, famines, 
concentration camps, and the all- embracing economic and 
political devastation. 
  We call upon all the peoples of the world that are exploited 
by Jews [zhydy] to unite in the noble cause against the servants 
of the Devil and localize them in their national state -- 
Israel. Let them show, to their full extent, the talents of the 
people chosen by God. We are convinced that, as soon as they 
get together in their own home, genuine brotherhood will prevail 
on our planet, and benevolence and peace will reign among all 
peoples. 
  The policy of Ukraine and Russia in the Crimean issue must 
be 
unambiguous: Not a single armed Ukrainian or Russian in the 
Crimean conflict. 
  Our slogan: "Free Ivan Demyanyuk, or Rid Ukraine of Jews!" 
helped release our fellow countryman from the Israeli prison 
where he had been tortured for seven years. 
  Our slogan: "Peace to the Ukrainian Crimea, or Rid Ukraine 
and Russia of Jews!" will caution the two Christian peoples 
against the confrontation, which will be pernicious for them, 
and which has been provoked by enemies of Christ. 
  Jews make a charming impression when they live in their 
national state and honestly and conscientiously earn their bread. 
  We call upon all clergymen of Ukraine and Russia to hold 
sermons for peace in the Crimea and pray to God so that He would 
instruct Jews to take care of Israel on their own territory and 
to pray for the triumph of a single holy United Apostle Church. 
  We call upon all political parties, public organizations, 
and 
all people of good will to hold rallies: "Peace for the 
Ukrainian Crimea! Away With Insidious Provocateurs!" "Down With 
Jewish Communo-Fascism!" 
  Let all states of the world cherish their national values, 
their national spirit, and moral traditions proceeding from the 
principles of humanism and good, and purify themselves from the 
international evil. 
  Mykhaylo Mankovskyy, chairman of the leadership of the Lvov 
Oblast Organization of Ukraine's Idealists.

  [Text] Kiev [No date as received] -- A plenary meeting of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council today approved the resolution "On 
anticrisis measures in the agro-industrial complex," taking into 
account proposals by government officials, ministries, 
departments, and parliamentary commissions. The draft 
resolution included a provision for exemption from value added 
tax on fish, seed, and livestock products from 1 June 1994 for 
agricultural procurement and processing enterprises. 
  The Supreme Council also approved amendments to the law of 
Ukraine "On election of deputies and chairmen of village, 
township, rayon, town, city district, and oblast councils." The 
new law allows council chairmen to be elected on a 
noncompetitive basis. Following proposals from a number of 
deputies, parliament ruled that a council chairman is considered 
to be elected provided at least 25 percent of the electorate 
vote in his favor. A council deputy is considered to be elected 
provided he is voted for by at least 10 percent of the 
electorate.

  [Text] Kiev, 16 June -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres signed a joint communique and a number of agreements 
following a meeting with government officials at the Cabinet of 
Ministers. The documents include an agreement on encouragement 
and mutual protection of investments, a trade and economic 
agreement, an agreement on cooperation in law enforcement and 
crime prevention, a program of cooperation in education and 
culture in 1994-96, and a protocol on special measures in the 
field of education toward implementation of the agreement 
between the Governments of Ukraine and Israel on cooperation in 
education. In addition, the Israeli foreign minister met a 
group of editors in chief of the Ukrainian media. Shimon Peres 
announced that a large group of Israeli businessmen, about 100 
people, were expected to arrive in Ukraine on 18 June. Touching 
upon the issue of confidence in the process of the Middle East 
settlement, the Israeli minister said he assessed favorably all 
that had been done and the present state of affairs. At the same 
time, Peres noted: "If there is something left to do, we will 
not leave the room." 
  Asked by UNIAN about Israel's view of the Crimean problem, 
Shimon Peres stressed his country's firm stance in support of 
Ukraine's territorial integrity. In reply to a question about 
the tension between the two countries caused by the Ministry of 
Justice statement on the activities of Sohnut agency, he said 
that the differences had been settled. The activities of 
Sohnut's branch in Ukraine are no different from the work of the 
same agencies in the United States, Great Britain, France, and 
other countries, he said.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The Israeli and 
Ukrainian foreign ministers, Shim'on Peres and Anatoliy Zlenko, 
held a joint news conference today at Ukraine's Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. Zlenko, in particular, said the development of 
relations between the two countries has deep roots. "To many 
sons and daughters of the Jewish people, Ukraine has become a 
homeland encouraging the evolution of their talent. We regret 
that some of the best and most highly qualified professionals 
are leaving Ukraine. Our country does not object to the natural 
process of Jewish emigration as long as it proceeds in a 
civilized manner," Anatoliy Zlenko said. 
  The Ukrainian foreign minister underscored his country's 
readiness to contribute to ending confrontation in the Middle 
East region on a multilateral basis within the framework of the 
United Nations. 
  Shim'on Peres said this was his first visit to Ukraine and 
he 
could see differences between the situation in Ukraine and the 
way it is described by some of the mass media. He expressed the 
opinion that cooperation in the sphere of culture and business 
could be particularly fruitful. 
  As for Ukraine's role in settling Middle East issues, 
Shim'on 
Peres emphasized that Israel would welcome Ukraine's possible 
participation in the peace process in the Middle East region. 
  As far the Crimean issue is concerned, the Israeli foreign 
affairs minister underscored that Israel has already expressed 
its support for the Ukrainian Government's policy and that 
position remains unchanged. 
  Shim'on Peres also said that he will stay in Ukraine for one 
more day and on 17 June will visit Odessa where, he said, 
Israel's consulate is to open in the very near future.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Odessa 16 June TASS -- "Ukraine is ready to consider 
the problems of the Black Sea navy by taking interests of the 
Russian Federation into account, but the Russian Federation 
should take into account Ukraine's interests, too," President 
Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine told servicemen of Ukraine's First 
Aeromobile Division stationed in the Bolgrad district. 
  "The Russian Federation now admits that Crimea is a 
constituent part of Ukraine. We are quite satisfied with this 
approach. However, Ukraine should play a leading part in solving 
the problems of the Black Sea Navy," Kravchuk said. 
  Touching upon differences between Russian and Ukrainian 
approaches to these problems, Kravchuk pointed out that Ukraine 
cannot accept the formulation which Russia wants to force upon 
it, namely that Sevastopol is a base of the Russian Navy. 
  "Sevastopol cannot be a base of the Russian Navy," he said. 
Ukraine proposes another formulation: "A base of the Russian 
Navy in Sevastopol" rather than "the Sevastopol base of the 
Russian Navy." 
  "The whole thing should be adopted in accordance with 
international principles and agreements. Naturally, it may be a 
matter of other bases of our country, too, where ships of 
Russian and Ukrainian Navies may be placed," Kravchuk added. 
  When in the division's quarters, Kravchuk familiarized 
himself with the servicemen's combat readiness, their way of 
life and watched them taking part in demonstration exercises. 
  Kravchuk will leave Izmail for Odessa late at night.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, member of the Crimean </F>
Cabinet of Ministers, and Doctor of Economic Sciences Vladimir 
Remyga, chairman of the Crimean State Committee for Foreign 
Economic Relations, by Aleksandr Ryabushev in Simferopol under 
the rubric "In Governments"; date not given: "Prosperity Lies 
in Unity"] 
  [Text] "How does Crimea see the new government in the 
future?" Our correspondent put this question to Yevgeniy 
Saburov, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, and to Doctor of 
Economic Sciences Vladimir Remyga, chairman of the Crimean State 
Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. 
  [Answer: speaker not identified] Well, first of all, I see 
the top-priority strategic task in the foreign economic policy 
sphere as determining a place for our Republic on a federative 
basis with Ukraine, and in Kiev's giving us economic autonomy. 
Full autonomy, according to the pattern of mutual relations 
between the governments of Tataria and Russia, and the 
settlement of contradictions between the Crimean Constitution of 
6 May 1992 and the legislative acts of the former Ukrainian 
parliament. But once these contradictions are definitively 
resolved by means of talks between Crimean and Ukrainian 
parliamentary commissions, then we will start to implement our 
own foreign economic program, which the Crimean Supreme Council 
has already submitted to us for ratification. 
  [Ryabushev] But talks could go on for a month, or two 
months, and the reforms will remain on paper only. 
  [Answer] No, we are not standing still. One of Yuriy 
Meshkov's first edicts was to open a trade mission in Moscow, 
and treaties on economic cooperation have been signed with 
Tatarstan and Krasnodar Kray. Not long ago the Crimean 
president flew out to Cyprus. We are now preparing to sign a 
similar agreement with Cyprus. In addition, a memorandum has 
been signed in Moscow with the trade representative of Taiwan, 
which wants to participate in the creation of a joint, 
transnational, "Kerch-Taiwan" free economic zone. A working 
group is already forming under the aegis of an international 
association for the development of free economic zones. In 
general terms, the priority concepts of our foreign economic 
program are: to attract foreign investment into Crimea and 
technical assistance within the framework of UN international 
programs; to secure the establishment in Crimea of an office of 
the agency for international cooperation with and investment in 
Ukraine, and offices of corresponding Russian and UN 
organizations; to organize cooperation with Ukrainian and 
Russian trade and economic missions; to establish 
telecommunications links and obtain the right of access to the 
information systems of the Russian and Ukrainian Ministries of 
Foreign Economic Relations; and to secure for Simferopol a 
regional office of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry consular 
administration. We are also planning to open a Crimean currency 
exchange and a center for clearing accounts for making payments 
between Crimean and Russian enterprises, and also to sign an 
agreement with Russia on a single certificate of safety for our 
output issued by the Crimean standardization service. As soon 
as political passions die down, we are planning to examine a 
project for the construction of a bridge linking Kerch with 
Krasnodar Kray. In a word, as is written on our Republic's 
emblem, prosperity lies in unity.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey Krasnoshchekov </F>
and Konstantin Oribytkov] 
  [Text] Crans-Montana (Switzerland), 17 Jun -- The 
deployment of CIS peace-keeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict zone is an important step along the path towards a 
comprehensive settlement of the conflict. This was stated in an 
exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Georgian 
Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia. He is heading Georgia's 
delegation at the international forum devoted to the problems of 
East-West relations which started here on Thursday. 
  "We regard this action with hope," the head of the Georgian 
Government noted, "and think that it should not be restricted 
solely to the bounds of Gali Rayon." He called the results of 
the visit to Georgia by Russian Federation Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev "encouraging," having stressed that "common 
approaches were achieved which allowed a number of agreements to 
be signed." "In relations with Russia," O.Patsatsia said, "we 
are returning to what it ought to be -- to friendship. We 
cannot get away from that." 
  At the same time, it is necessary to continue the active 
quests for ways of attaining a peaceful political settlement to 
the conflict, the prime minister pointed out, having admitted 
that "this process will be a lengthy and delicate one." In 
Crans-Montana he intends to discuss this issue with (Eduard 
Brunner), the special representative of the UN secretary general. 
  Commenting, at the request of ITAR-TASS, on the stand taken 
by the Georgian prime minister, Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy 
chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation, 
who is head of the delegation at the Crans-Montana forum, noted: 
"This is not the first time we have been able to see for 
ourselves that Georgia's progress, the prospects for development 
that are opening up before her are directly linked with Russia. 
There is no other way. Russia has saved Georgia from internal 
division and outside threat more than once, and therefore 
orientation on Russia corresponds to the interests of Georgia." 
This is also important for Russia, he continued, since any 
destabilization in this region has a direct effect on us too. 
It is sufficient to recall that approximately 100,000 refugees 
from Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been forced to seek refuge 
on the territory of Russia. R. Abdulatipov spoke out in support 
of the decision of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to 
deploy peace-keeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict 
zone and expressed the hope that, in discussing this issue on 21 
June, the Federation Council would also express itself in favor 
of this measure. 
  In the opinion of the deputy chairman of the Federation 
Council, "Russia is not interested in servicemen from other 
states taking part in the peace-keeping forces since it is a 
question of the zone of her national interests." The 
interference of any other forces, he thinks, will not promote 
stability in the region. "For the moment I can only remind you 
that it is largely thanks to the Russian peace-keeping forces 
that they have practically managed to put an end to the war in 
South Ossetia, and thanks to Russian soldiers and officers peace 
is being maintained there and the situation is gradually getting 
back to normal," R. Abdulatipov pointed out.

  [Text] The Georgian Defense Ministry press service has 
circulated a report stating that, in accordance with a plan 
agreed upon at the Abkhaz-Georgian Moscow negotiations, the 
deployment of Russian troops in the conflict zone was intended 
to begin on 17 June and be completed on 19 June. 
  However, because of curt statements made by some 
representatives of the parliamentary opposition, urging that the 
implementation of the mission by a Russian peacekeeping 
contingent should not take place, the stationing of troops in 
the conflict zone may presumably be postponed for an indefinite 
period.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi June 17 TASS -- The Russian army group in 
Transcaucasia is holding a tactical military exercise on a 
regimental scale on a Black Sea coast near Batumi, Adjaria, on 
Friday. The aim of the exercise is to improve actions to rebuff 
an enemy landing party. 
  Marines are landing from Black Sea Fleet ships and 
helicopters, simulating air and artillery strikes, while 
defenders will hold out under the onslaught of superior enemy 
forces and defeat them. 
  President Eduard Shevardnadze and Georgian brass hats 
departed for the war games. Journalists interpreted this move 
as a pretext for a meeting with Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze. 
  According to earlier reports, the latter temporarily 
combined 
the duties of parliament speaker (he dissolved parliament last 
year by his decree) with the duties of Adjarian premier. 
Reports say that this was done "at the suggestion of the heads 
of ministries and departments of the autonomous republic". 
  This move caused anxiety in Tbilisi which is concerned that 
Adjaria is increasingly disassociating itself from Georgia. 
  Despite the fact that the list of Russian journalists was 
compiled and agreed upon in good time, they got up at early 
hours and arrived at the Tbilisi airport in advance. 
  Nevertheless, they were removed from the plane, as ITAR-TASS 
learnt, "due to overload". Therefore, journalists have to be 
content with paltry reports received at the press centre of the 
Russian army group in Tbilisi.

  [Excerpts] On 23 May, a meeting of the Georgian Workers 
Communist Party, the Georgian Union of Communists, the political 
organization "Stalin," and the international organization 
"Remembrance of Stalin" was held in the conference hall of the 
Officers House in Tbilisi. 
  Major General Panteleimon Giorgadze, member of the bureau of 
the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central Committee, 
delivered the opening address. He congratulated those 
participating in the meeting on the unification of 
socialist-oriented parties and organizations in Georgia and 
wished them fruitful labor in the struggle for Georgia's happy 
future. 
  Those participating in the meeting unanimously supported the 
proposal made by Communist Pilipe Makharadze that the 
socialist- oriented political parties and organizations in 
Georgia unite to form one party that would be called "the 
Georgian United Communist Party." He pointed out: "Our 
strength and invincibility lies in unification. In order to 
form the right and effective leadership of the united parties, 
it is necessary to create a provisional political council in the 
period prior to the congress; this council will, at the same 
time, supervise preparations for the party congress." 
  On his proposal, those participating in the meeting -- there 
were 452 Communists present -- adopted the decision that the 
current meeting of socialist-oriented parties and organizations 
should be called the United Congress of Parties Adhering 
to Socialist Ideas. 
  A decision of the congress participants confirmed KOMUNISTI, 
the press organ of the Georgian Workers Communist Party, as the 
Georgian United Communist Party paper. [passage omitted] 
  Following discussion of the question, the congress adopted a 
resolution and elected the members of the Georgian United 
Communist Party Political Council. 
  At the same time, a Georgian United Communist Party 
Political 
Council session was held at which the rules of the party were 
approved by a majority of votes. The rules are published in 
this edition of the paper. 
  At the session, Panteleimon Giorgadze was elected chairman 
of 
the Georgian United Communist Party Political Council. 
  The following were elected deputy chairmen: Sergo Rigvava, 
Grigol Oniani, and Vilhelm Makharadze. [passage omitted] 
  On 3 June 1994, a Georgian Workers Communist Party Central 
Committee plenum was held. The plenum discussed organizational 
matters. 
  1. Ivane Tsiklauri was released from his duties 
as first secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party 
Central Committee and was removed from the bureau. 
  2. Shalva Berianidze was released from his duties 
as secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central 
Committee and removed from the bureau. 
  3. Panteleimon Giorgadze was elected first 
secretary of the Georgian Workers Communist Party Central 
Committee, Vilhelm Makharadze was elected second 
secretary, and Manana Kevanishvili secretary.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 16, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) adopted amendments Thursday to the law on radio and 
television stipulating free distribution and use of state-owned 
radio and television program charts. 
  Consequently, legislators rejected the previous version of 
the bill that applied copyright norms to state-owned radio and 
TV programs. 
  Democratic Party's Ilga Grava supported the new version 
claiming that a broadcast schedule is not creative work but "a 
showing of work content of state institutions." 
  The paid publication of the programs would soar newspaper 
prices and tax-payers would have to make additional investment 
into the maintenance of state-owned radio and television, 
speakers said.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 16, BNS -- Aloyzas Sakalas, the head 
of the parliamentary faction of the Lithuanian Social Democratic 
Party (LSDP) and deputy parliament chairman, presented the 
Seimas [parliament] Thursday with a draft vote of no confidence 
to the Lithuanian government led by Adolfas Slezevicius. "We 
cannot look indifferently at how our economy has been 
deteriorating," Sakalas said. 
  The Social Democratic faction who initiated the motion of 
non- confidence blame the government for failing to stabilize 
the national economy or "to make the life of Lithuanian people 
easier." 
  However, the LSDP says that the main motive for no 
confidence 
to the Cabinet of the governing Lithuanian Democratic Labor 
Party (LDLP), is the failure to carry out the commitments the 
party took on in the pre-election period last June. "Then it 
/LSDP election program/ was the best basis for reforming the 
Lithuanian economy," said the chairman of the LSDP faction. 
  "The left-wing government has fallen short of coming up with 
an industry restructuring programme foreseeing the directions of 
its development; the best ways of using energy resources, 
scientific and labor potential; and sales on foreign and 
domestic markets," said Sakalas. 
  85 percent of foreign loans assigned to Lithuania was used 
by 
the government for consumer purposes. Each Lithuanian citizen 
owes foreign creditors $120 which were "eaten up instead of 
investing," according to the LSDP lawmaker. 
  In the sphere of agriculture the government has failed to 
coordinate the production of farmers and food-processing 
industries, Sakalas said. 
  He termed the tax and budget policy as "being badly 
implemented. Heavy taxes burden people who live merely on their 
salaries, while no indexing of budgetary expenditure is carried 
out and inflation rates are not taken into account." 
  The Social Democratic MP stated that the Slezevicius-led 
government has also neglected its pledge to set equal salaries 
for state-employed specialists with equal qualifications. "Why 
are teachers, physicians, and culture workers paid 2 to 3 times 
less than employees in the energy system?," Sakalas said. 
  The government missed the most favorable moment for indexing 
people's savings devaluated by inflation -- this should have 
been done while introducing the national currency, according to 
the chairman of the LSDP. 
  The only consequences of the Slezevicius-led government is a 
decrease in the Gross Domestic Product, industrial production, 
and construction of flats by 35, 46 and 38 percent, 
respectively, during the year 1993, Sakalas said. 
  The economy has failed to be stabilized, the savings of 
people are further being devaluated by the ever-widening gab 
between prices and interest rates. "The standard of living has 
declined, social stratification has been on the rise 
dramatically, while no stabilization was reached in either the 
economic or social developments," Sakalas pointed out. 
  The head of the Social Democratic Party noted that the 
curbing of inflation processes "does not guarantee economic 
stability as always stressed by the prime minister." 
  After the statements of the Social Democratic faction, 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, who is also 
chairman of the LDLP, answered question put forward by members 
of parliament.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 16, BNS -- "The government is 
implementing in consecutive order the main principles of its 
program," said Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius 
replying to the draft resolution of no confidence presented to 
parliament by the Social Democratic faction Thursday. 
  Slezevicius said the Sixth Cabinet entered upon office at a 
time when the national economy was increasingly deteriorating. 
Among the most pressing circumstances were exorbitant 
inflation, a catastrophic decline in people's real income, an 
entirely ruined agriculture, declining industry, high crime 
rates, and a nearly $100 million debt to Russia for imported 
energy resources, according to Slezevicius. 
  "The average salary at that time was $27.00 while the 
average 
pension stood at merely $8.00. In the three years that had 
preceded a site was not allotted for the construction of an oil 
terminal on Lithuania's Baltic Sea coast. Instability reigned 
in Lithuania's monetary system and the foreign and economic 
policies were inefficient," Slezevicius enumerated. "At that 
point Lithuania was desperately lagging behind Latvia and 
Estonia. This was stated by both foreign experts and our 
neighbors who ruled out any possibility of economic cooperation 
under the circumstances," said Slezevicius, adding that 
"therefore the government was first of all trying to overcome 
the difficulties and stabilize the economy." 
  The prime minister stated that a boost was given to the 
economy after the government fixed adequate prices for energy 
resources, abandoned unnecessary subsidies, liberalized exports 
and imports and -- most significantly -- introduced, together 
with the Bank of Lithuania, the national currency, the lit. 
Later a law on the stability of the currency was passed. 
  The prime minister said that inflation decreased from its 
high 1,160 percent in 1992 and 189 percent in 1993 to the 
present level of 20.3 percent within five months of the fiscal 
1994. "Inflation is the main macroeconomic indicator of the 
state of things in the whole economy," Slezevicius noted. 
  The premier said that the real income of the Lithuanian 
population in 1992 had dropped by 69.2 percent, but a 12.7 
percent increase in it was achieved the following year. 
According to Slezevicius, "this is not much but a certain 
progress has been made." This year, in spite of inflation owing 
to the newly introduced Value Added Tax, the growth of the real 
income was 4.8 percent, according to the prime minister. 
  Comparing the growth of people's income in the three Baltic 
States, Slezevicius said that in Lithuania the average salary 
has increased 2.8 times, while the respective figures in Latvia 
and Estonia are 1.9 and 1.3. "Taking into account the 
differences in prices for municipal services /in Lithuania, 
Latvia and Estonia/, we can state that the former two and a half 
times gap in the purchasing power has been evened entirely," 
said the prime minister. 
  According to him, all international financial organizations, 
including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, 
are predicting good prospects for economic development in 
Lithuania. 
  The prime minister said that 55 percent of all investment 
into the Lithuanian economy last year came from oversees, "which 
illustrates the growth of foreign investment". 
  The prime minister regretted that, in their draft resolution 
of no confidence to the government, the Social Democratic 
faction failed to notice even a single positive shift in the 
governing Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's [LDLP] policies. 
Their accusations are presented "in a very biased manner search 
narrow political interests," Slezevicius said. 
  The prime minister also reminded members of parliament that 
nearly all Lithuanian political forces have refused to take part 
in "the constructive activities," but opted for "the road of 
traversing and opposing" the activities of the LDLP, its 
parliamentary majority and government. 
  "All political forces were invited to take part in the work 
of the government, but the proposals got no response," 
Slezevicius said. He added that "the government is determined 
to continue the reforms and critically evaluates its own work." 
An amended program of action drawn up by the government is 
expected to be handed in to parliament soon.

  [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia has abolished air 
communications with its break-away southern republic of 
Chechnya. The Russian Ministry of Transport has sent a message 
to Groznyy that it suspends all flights from Russian airports to 
Chechnya as well as those from the Chechen capital to any 
airport of Russia, Shirvani Pashayev, an aide of the Chechen

  [Text] Bishkek, 16 Jun -- "The som has strengthened its 
position," said Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov in an interview 
with a KYRGYZKABAR correspondent. "Judge for yourself. The 
inflation rate in February this year was 16.9 percent and in 
June, 3.5 percent. The national currency has also stabilized. 
One dollar now costs not 12.35 soms as in February, but 11.4. 
In March-April, production became more brisk and the tendency 
could have been maintained had inflation slowed down, but [word 
indistinct] on all kinds of industrial goods over a month has 
decreased by 28 percent. All of the national economy's 
indicators have deteriorated. To improve the situation, we need 
investors from outside, and we are looking for them. I recently 
met Salem Ehasesom [name as received], the representative of the 
World Bank. The topic under discussion was attracting 
investments to the mining industry. We have been told that the 
World Bank is looking for the funds to carry out a tender so as 
to finance geological surveys in this area. The problems are 
expected to be settled during a meeting in June in the U.S. city 
of Houston. We know that the donor countries, such as Norway, 
will render us consultative services not only for surveying oil 
fields, but also in elaborating the law on the use of nature. 
  "The Government of Kyrgyzstan is eager to render any kind of 
support to foreign entrepreneurs in surveying and developing gas 
and oil fields. 
  "The issue of investments will be the main topic on the 
agenda of the second meeting of the Japan-Kyrgyzstan economic 
commission, which is due to take place in November. I have the 
honor of being the chairman of this commission. We have 
prepared a number of projects for joint ventures with Japan in 
the food industry, for example, in the production of rice, baby 
food, silk, leather, and also in the mining industry. We should 
invigorate prospecting for oil and gas. Kyrgyzstan will give an 
advantage to those companies who have experience in developing 
oil and gas fields. He also said [as received] that in the near 
future we intend to open a free economic zone centered in 
Tokmak, near the capital. 
  "We can only add here that over one month, the money income 
of the population has decreased by 3 percent and spendings and 
savings have increased by 12.9 percent. In reality, 
accumulations have been minimal. In January-May, the savings 
bank of the Republic has attracted 5-percent less in savings 
than during the same period last year. 
  "There has also been a slowdown in business activities. For 
example, a number of commodity and raw materials exchanges has 
decreased twofold. More than 60 percent of their turnover comes 
from the machine-building industry, diesel fuel, and timber. 
  "In a nutshell, inflation has been brought to a minimum, but 
we have not yet started the structural transformations in 
industry. The Republic is awaiting a large Western credit, but 
it has not created conditions for invigorating investment 
activity."

  [Text] The Inter-Tajik negotiations will be conducted in a 
difficult situation due to a wave of terroristic acts which have 
been conducted by the armed opposition in the Republic, believes 
leader of the governmental delegation Shukurjon Zuhurov, 
Tajikistan's Labor and Employment Minister. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX Thursday [16 June] he said 
that 
Dushanbe hopes for a favorable outcome of the next round of 
negotiations with the opposition which was started on 18 June in 
Teheran. Zuhurov said the governmental delegation intends to 
discuss three packages of issues at the negotiations -- on 
peaceful settlement of the political situation in the Republic, 
complete return of refugees, and on the constitutional system 
and consolidation of the state. 
  According to Zuhurov, the issues related to the return of 
refugees are already at the stage "of active implementation" in 
accordance with the agreements reached at the first round of the 
negotiations on 5-19 April in Moscow. Zuhurov reported that as 
many as 3,500 refugees from Afghanistan and about 10,000 people 
from CIS countries have returned over this period of time. An 
official commission to render aid and assistance to the forced 
migrants and refugees has started its work in Moscow to help 
them to return to their homeland. It consists both of 
representatives of Dushanbe and the Tajik opposition. 
  The governmental delegation is due to fly to Tehran on 17 
June.

  [Text] The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency predicts that 
Ukraine will disintegrate this year for both ethnic and economic 
reasons. This was stated by Ukrainian presidential candidate 
Leonid Kuchma at a meeting with Zaporizhzhya residents at the 
"Dniprospetsstal" industrial complex. Therefore, the entire 
activity of the future president must be directed toward 
maintaining peace and quiet. History offers Ukraine its last 
chance to build an independent state. The road toward that is 
through economic union with CIS countries and adherence to 
current legislation.

able to defend their land, sovereignty and inviolability of 
state borders. In spite of the financial and material 
difficulties, Ukraine has a ready-for-combat army. It does not 
threaten anyone, however," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
told servicemen of the First Ukrainian Aeromobile Division 
stationed in the Bolgrad District. 
  Touching upon "Crimean issues," Kravchuk emphasized that 
they 
should be solved only within the framework of Ukraine's 
Constitution. "Member states of the European Union and other 
countries support this position. Russian officialdom, including 
President Yeltsin, is of the same opinion. According to the 
acting Ukrainian Constitution and the trilateral agreement, 
Ukraine is a sovereign state and no one is entitled to break its 
integrity," Kravchuk said. 
  "We will not hamper the autonomous republic's drive for more 
independence. The official Kiev is ready to consider (Crimea's 
proposals to this effect). However, it should not be a matter 
of territory. The territory of our sovereign state is 
untouchable and no one should surpass the red line. We shall 
defend our integrity in accordance with the Constitution and 
shall not permit anyone to neglect our laws," Kravchuk 
emphasized.

  [Text] Kiev, 15 Jun -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
received Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres during the 
minister's visit to Ukraine. 
  "Ukraine attaches great importance to the development of 
friendly bilateral relations with Israel," the Ukrainian 
president stressed. "This visit opens a new stage in Ukraine's 
relations with Israel." 
  Leonid Kravchuk spoke warmly about his visit to Israel in 
January last year when he signed a memorandum on mutual 
understanding and fundamental principles of cooperation between 
the two countries. At the same time, Ukraine's and Israel's 
foreign ministries signed a protocol on consultations. The two 
countries also signed intergovernmental agreements on 
cooperation in education, culture, science and technology, 
agriculture, and air transportation. 
  "To us, Israel is and has been a sovereign state with which 
we are keen to develop relations," the Ukrainian president said. 
"We are neighbors, and many of our countrymen are now citizens 
of Israel. They live there and they wish Ukraine to be happy. 
  "We have worked out a considerable legislative basis for the 
development of our relations. The main thing is that the people 
of Ukraine want to have friendly relations with Israel, and 
there are no problems that we cannot solve."

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "NATO Invites Kozyrev to </F>
Brussels"] 
  [Text] At the latest session of the NATO Council the North 
Atlantic alliance member countries' permanent representatives 
adopted a decision, as the press release says, "to invite Russia 
to immediately begin talks in Brussels" on the problem of 
developing broader relations. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry has been informed of this 
decision but has not yet received NATO's proposals which would, 
on the one hand, augment the Partnership for Peace program, 
which has already been signed by 18 European states not 
belonging to the bloc, and on the other would take into account 
Russia's special significance and role in European and 
international affairs. 
  To judge from paragraph nine of the NATO Council decision, 
which gives a quite extravagant account of Russia's significance 
and talks of the need for the alliance to develop ties with it, 
Brussels is aware that there can be no hope of the further 
strengthening of stability and security in Europe without it. 
Furthermore, the principle on which the new relations will be 
based -- the "deepening of partnership without reciprocal vetoes 
and surprises" -- causes no objections either in Moscow or in 
Brussels. In other words, Brussels need not fear that Moscow is 
going to interfere in NATO's affairs and Russia can expect to be 
consulted when pan-European affairs are being decided. 
  Moscow has set out its vision of Russia's ties with NATO 
twice -- the first time in Brussels during Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev's visit there, and again last week in Istanbul, 
where they were developed by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
Outwardly at least NATO reacted quite coolly to the Russian 
proposals, fearing criticism from the East Europeans for 
compliance toward "Moscow's expansionism" and hoping that the 
active campaign for Europe's affiliation to the Partnership for 
Peace program will force Russia to make major concessions. 
  When asked what compromise Moscow might make, one 
well-informed Russian policy expert replied that Russia will not 
be opposed to formulating additional measures in relations with 
NATO in a separate protocol and will undoubtedly insist on 
creating some kind of consultative mechanism, which would make 
it possible to conduct a broad dialogue on the whole range of 
policy and security questions. 
  Brussels is expecting the Russian Foreign Minister for talks 
as early as next week. At the Russian Foreign Ministry 
IZVESTIYA was told that Kozyrev did indeed intend to visit 
Brussels and launch large-scale cooperation with the North 
Atlantic alliance.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- A unit of Black Sea Fleet 
ships has left its base in Sevastopol for the Greek island of 
Corfu, a source in the fleet's press centre told TASS today.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Portanskiy: "Last Obstacle to Russia-EU </F>
Agreement Removed"] 
  [Text] The announcement of the fact that President Boris 
Yeltsin will be setting off 24 June for the Greek island of 
Corfu to sign a partnership and cooperation agreement between 
Russia and the EU was made to Russians with reference to the 
Greek deputy foreign minister, who revealed the news in 
Luxembourg Tuesday. The report was couched in the affirmative 
-- not "intends to come," but "will come." 
  The most interesting point is that at the time of the Greek 
deputy minister's speech nobody in the Russian leadership, 
including delegation heads at the talks with the EU or even 
Boris Nikolayevich himself, could officially state that the 
Russian president would be flying to Corfu -- although 
everything was headed in that direction. 
  There are indeed no points at issue in the text of the 
partnership agreement, and intensive technical work to prepare 
it for signing is currently under way. 
  The other day Boris Yeltsin voiced the intention to sign 
this 
important document, but only in the event of its being utterly 
complete. I would recall that the Russian Federation president 
was invited to sign this agreement a year ago in Copenhagen, but 
the ceremony did not go ahead because we were dissatisfied with 
the quality of the agreement. 
  Moscow is right to announce that Boris Yeltsin will be 
flying 
to sign the partnership agreement, at least after having 
examined and confirmed the draft at a government session which 
has not yet been held. Otherwise, we would have a situation 
where EU ministers had held their own council of ministers 
session, as arranged, and given the green light to the signing 
of the document with Russia and would have automatically nodded 
through a similar decision on Moscow's behalf -- even though, I 
would repeat, Russia is striving to move to a new level of 
relations with its West European partners no less than the EU is. 
  Also on Tuesday in Luxembourg President Leonid Kravchuk 
signed the partnership agreement between Ukraine and the EU. 
Ukraine has thus become the first CIS republic to sign such a 
document with the EU, which is something to celebrate and to 
sincerely congratulate our Commonwealth neighbors [sosedyam] on. 
  At the same time, this has allowed certain observers both 
here and abroad to talk about some kind of advantageous position 
for Kiev in obtaining a specific result in relations with West 
Europe. In actual fact, although Russia-EU and Ukraine-EU 
relations are similar, there are also some quite fundamental 
differences between them. 
  From the economic standpoint Ukraine is still seen by the 
countries of the "12" as the same as the former Union -- that 
is, as a state with a centralized economy. On the contrary, 
Russia is recognized as having the status of a country with a 
transitional type of economy, which has rejected a 
state-controlled trading system. The Ukrainian document does 
not have a provision on trade in uranium, whereas in the Russian 
document it has been a stumbling block in the final stage. 
  For the EU the last obstacle to an agreement with Russia is 
being removed as a result of the signing by President Yeltsin 
the other day of an edict restoring the rights of five West 
European banks in Russia.

  [Text] Washington, 17 June -- On Thursday the World Bank 
approved the granting of two loans to the Russian Federation for 
the development of agriculture. 
  One of them -- for $240 million -- is intended for 
accelerating the process of reforms in the agricultural sector, 
for creating a network of information and consultation services 
for farmers, for help in organizing individual, highly efficient 
enterprises. The other -- for 80 million dollars -- should 
assist in the process of land reform and privatization. 
  The loans are being granted on what are customary conditions 
for the World Bank, the repayment term is 17 years.

  [Text] Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
told Interfax that although Pyongyang's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] complicated matters, 
Russia was not withdrawing its call for an international 
conference on the Korean peninsula. 
  He said it was not Pyongyang's decision to withdraw from the 
IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that called for 
sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a country for 
this kind of decision, Panov said, because any country had the 
right to join a treaty or withdraw from it. 
  Panov went on to say that the international community was 
discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and 
cooperate with the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA had failed to 
get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and had 
moved to raise the issue of sanctions. 
  Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested 
in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for 
an international conference was gaining support, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 16 Jun -- North Korea is not yet ready to 
make an atom bomb in the opinion of Viktor Mikhaylov, the 
Russian Minister of Atomic Energy. It is too complicated a 
process, he said today when he was asked by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent whether the DPRK will be able to produce enough 
plutonium to make atomic weapons. 
  As for the DPRK's departure from the IAEA, Viktor Mikhaylov 
considers that "this is more a cry from the heart on North 
Korea's part." He urged a dialogue between Russia and the 
United States on the issue of sanctions against the DPRK, 
observing that the country cannot be isolated, even if it 
announces its departure from the IAEA. "I think," he 
emphasized, "that on the North Korean issue dialogue will 
prevail and the DPRK will remain in the IAEA."

  [Begin Moyiseyev recording] We believe the draft resolution

Pyongyang -- not just Pyongyang alone but other countries

any positive results and after all other political methods of

then can step-by-step sanctions be applied. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by M. Ponomarev: "Heightened Hysteria Envelops the </F>
the Pentagon Too?"] 
  [Text] The unimaginable commotion in the U.S. mass media 
over the problems in the nuclear sphere which have emerged on 
the Korean peninsula is spreading. It seems that the U.S. 
Defense Department has also given way to the hysteria being 
fueled by some newspapers and television companies. 
  THE WASHINGTON TIMES asserts that concrete plans are being 
hastily drawn up in the Pentagon in case of an outbreak of 
military actions. As far as can be judged, it is primarily a 
matter of reinforcing the South Korean troops deployed in the 
region of the DMZ dividing North and South Korea. Pentagon 
experts believe that the configuration of forces there is now 
clearly to Seoul's disadvantage: The South Korean Army has only 
a few large combined units in the vicinity of the Zone, totaling 
21 divisions, whereas the DPRK has concentrated two-thirds of 
its armed forces there, comprising 1.2 million men in all. 
  Because of this, it is reported from Washington, the 
Pentagon 
is examining options for transferring U.S. troops into the DMZ 
area. Right now the number of American troops on the Korean 
peninsula totals 36,000 men. But they can quickly be bolstered 
by a further 26,000 Marines stationed in Okinawa. It is also 
planned to move additional armaments to the threatened region 
and to top up reserves of equipment and ammunition, in 
particular the so-called "bunker bombs" designed to destroy 
hardened underground targets. Among such targets the U.S. 
generals primarily class installations associated with the DPRK 
nuclear complex in Yongbyon. 
  Citing "informed sources," the U.S. press writes that the 
intelligence services have already transferred additional 
skilled staff to South Korea. They are being employed to 
analyze and evaluate information received from artificial earth 
satellites, reconnaissance aircraft, and bugging devices located 
at sea and on land. 
  Citing the magazine DEFENSE NEWS, ITAR-TASS also reports 
that 
the U.S. Defense Department intends to make use of the latest 
acoustic technologies to identify and chart underground passages 
and tunnels which it is suggested that Pyongyang has 
constructed. These installations, allegedly created for "covert 
penetration" of South Korean territory, are supposed to be 
revealed by studying the concussion [detonatsiya] resulting from 
exploding special charges, using a method developed by the 
"Eliant Techsystem" [name as transliterated] company. 
  These are just a few of the items appearing in the U.S. 
press 
on the subject of Pentagon preparations for a possible war on 
the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Soltan commentary] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang still has the time and the possibility to 
avoid sanctions. One thing only is needed for that: North Korea 
must change its present stand, which only generates more 
suspicion that the country already has or intends to have its 
own nuclear weapons. The Moscow proposal still holds about 
calling a many-sided conference to postpone sanctions. The 
conference might work out effective measures to safeguard the 
sovereignty and security of the two Korean states, that's on the 
one hand, and on the other to guarantee a nuclear-free status 
for the Korean peninsula. 
  North Korea is among many countries that considers such a 
conference feasible, but its conduct so far, especially its 
withdrawal from the IAEA, makes one think that the country opts 
for a path of upsetting the nuclear nonproliferation regimen. 
If that is the case the international community has no other 
choice but to introduce sanctions. Russia's foreign minister, 
Andrey Kozyrev, says such a development would be highly 
undesirable. 
  The United States draft resolution put before the United 
Nations Security Council offers an embargo on arms supplies to 
North Korea, curtailing financial transactions with it and 
suspending United Nations relief aid, but even if the draft is 
passed the sanctions will be phased, not introduced immediately. 
Pyongyang still has the time to prove to the world that its 
nuclear program is strictly peaceful. 
  As for brandishing arms, this is something fully applicable 
not only to Pyongyang but also to Washington and Seoul. That 
can have serious complications on the state of affairs on the 
Korean peninsula and in the rest of northeast Asia.

<F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "Fear Is Receding, but the </F>
Threat Still Exists"] 
  [Text] A truly symbolic fact. Today not one of the many 
hundreds of our strategic nuclear missiles located in silos, on 
mobile systems, and on board submarines is any longer aimed at 
any target on U.S. or British territory. Nor do the United 
States and Britain now target their strategic missiles on 
targets in Russia or on any other former Soviet territory. 
  The abandonment of reciprocal missile targeting confirms 
that, for all the complexity and ambiguity of the international 
situation and despite all the conflicts, including armed 
conflicts, which are poisoning the atmosphere in the world, the 
threat of nuclear war is receding. It is doing so slowly, 
getting held up time and again on the intervening borders, but 
nonetheless increasingly noticeably even to the naked eye. At 
the same time fear of the possibility of such a threat is also 
receding. 
  More and more evidence of this is coming to light. KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA said not so long ago that the United States had adopted 
the decision to abandon the "Doomsday" program, which provided 
for the creation of underground shelters for the purpose of 
ensuring the continuity of the country's political and military 
leadership in the event of a nuclear conflict. This program, 
which, so THE NEW YORK TIMES writes, had recently appeared 
merely "a pale shadow of the concept approved by President 
Reagan in 1983," has now been deemed to have lost its urgency. 
  The FRG Government intends to follow suit and take a similar 
measure. A shelter designed to accommodate top government 
establishments in the event of a nuclear war had been 
constructed back in the sixties near Bonn -- between the towns 
of Ahrweiler and Dernau. It was reckoned that this would enable 
3,000 people to survive such a war. Galleries many kilometers 
long, with working and living premises, storehouses for food and 
other supplies, and even a cemetery-crematorium, were tunneled 
at a depth of over 300 meters beneath the slopes of a mountain 
covered with vineyards. 
  The question of ending further funding (more than 10 million 
marks annually) to maintain the government shelter and its 
defenses in working order is now at the decision stage. At the 
same time supporters of such a measure recall that nuclear 
shelters are already being sold off in Britain, and 
approximately 800 of them have already acquired new owners, who 
use them as wine cellars or mushroom farms. 
  Russia, incidentally, is also starting to take the same 
path. 
The majority of Yaroslavl's 200 shelters, constructed in the 
past to save its residents in the event of war, are now being 
fitted out as offices, stores, sports halls, production shops, 
warehouses, and even auditoriums. At the same time the lessees 
are obliged to maintain the shelters' equipment in working order 
and to vacate them if an emergency should arise. 
  There is also, of course, far weightier confirmation of the 
fact that the nuclear threat and also, at the same time, the 
fear of it are increasingly receding into the past. It is 
possible to recall that Britain has also recently begun to take 
measures to reduce nuclear armaments by approximately 25 
percent. In particular, the British Ministry of Defence has 
abandoned plans to fit nuclear warheads to the 50 Tomahawk 
cruise missiles being purchased from the United States and 
earmarked for installation on Trafalgar-class attack submarines. 
As for France, whereas only quite recently it was planned to 
build six nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear ballistic 
missiles, Paris has now decided to stop at four. 
  These are just a few examples which show, in fact, that the 
fear of the possibility of a nuclear missile war being 
unleashed, which hung over mankind for long years like the Sword 
of Damocles, is gradually beginning to recede. But it is still 
too soon to bang the drums -- suffice it to recall the grave 
misgivings aroused by the situation taking shape on the Korean 
Peninsula in the nuclear sphere. The threat of the uncontrolled 
proliferation of nuclear weapons still seems real. No way can 
this be disregarded.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Washington Proposes First </F>
Sanctions Against Pyongyang"] 
  [Text] Washington -- The United States has proposed the 
first package of measures for economic sanctions against North 
Korea to the United Nations. While former U.S. President James 
Carter enticed the DPRK foreign minister at a state dinner in 
Seoul with prospects of extensive trade, respectful relations, 
and mutually advantageous trading exchange between the despotic 
Pyongyang and Washington, leader of the free world, M. Albright, 
U.S. permanent representative at the United Nations, clearly 
showed that her government was tired of waiting. 
  The sanctions against North Korea -- which has left the 
international organizations that inspect and coordinate all work 
with nuclear materials -- have put the United Nations face to 
face with the need for action. The United States has taken the 
lead, as usual in recent years. The first set of measures 
proposed by Washington on Wednesday does not look very 
impressive. It is believed that the United Nations will only 
approve two points: discontinuing weapons trading with the DPRK 
and discontinuing all air flights except for passenger flights. 
  Observers maintain that this is just the first step. If 
Pyongyang does not listen and continues its policy, tougher 
sanctions will follow. In particular, the next step will be to 
freeze all the DPRK's assets in international banks and exclude 
this country from transnational financial activity. 
  North Korea has repeatedly stated that it will consider any 
economic sanctions to be an act tantamount to a declaration of 
war. However, a group of journalists who arrived in Pyongyang 
together with Jimmy Carter did not discover any outward signs of 
preparation for combat operations. 
  The magnificent reception given to Ex-President Carter by no 
means signifies Pyongyang's readiness to respond to his 
initiative. Carter's idea briefly boils down to North Korea 
being promised serious political and business contacts, and 
talks about this would start straight away as soon as the DPRK 
restores access to its nuclear reactors for international 
inspection. However, these promises have met with no response 
in Pyongyang. 
  Many people believe that the DPRK will continue with its 
tough brinkmanship [protivostoyaniye na grani voiyny] until it 
receives real diplomatic recognition in the West and until the 
blockade, which has become particularly painful following the 
disintegration of the USSR and China's greater involvement in 
the world economic process, is broken. 
  However, all the indications are that North Korea's 
intentions do not end there. As one expert on the region said, 
"through its activity in developong [sozdaniye] an atomic bomb, 
Pyongyang wants to achieve two aims. The first is to achieve 
international recognition. The second is to obtain an atomic 
bomb." 
  Analysts believe that the aged North Korean dictator Kim 
Il-song can foresee a time when the unification of Korea into a 
single state will become inevitable. Possessing nuclear weapons 
may be a the deciding trump card both at the unification 
negotiating table, and, equally importantly, under the table.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK's decision to withdraw from the IAEA has 
created new tensions with regard to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. Our station commentator (Krichevskiy) writes: 
  Pyongyang has taken a new, very dangerous measure to beef up 
its confrontation with the international community. By so 
doing, Pyongyang tries to free itself from the IAEA's 
intervention with regard to the nuclear issue. However, this 
measure does not mean that the DPRK can ignore the IAEA's right 
to continue the inspections. This is because the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] stipulates such a right. The DPRK 
is still a signatory of this treaty. 
  Pyongyang's decision immediately has caused a greater worry 
worldwide. A problem facing governments of many countries and 
the United Nations is what they should do. The United States 
more strongly demands that sanctions be imposed immediately. 
  Russia has begun to refer to sanctions more often. Russia 
does not like to see a country -- that violates the NPT and 
possesses nuclear weapons -- appear in its neighborhood. Russia 
does not like to see the situation along its border aggravated, 
either. 
  However, sanctions will inevitably bring such results. 
Therefore, Moscow has tenaciously pursued the possibility of 
imposing sanctions step by step and a proposal for convening an 
international conference attended by representatives of Russia, 
China, the United States, the DPRK, the ROK, the IAEA, and the 
United Nations. 
  There have been some results. After talking to U.S. 
President Clinton over telephone on 14 June, President Yeltsin 
said that they agreed to convene an international conference on 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. They assigned the 
Russian Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Secretary of State to the 
task of linking the issue of holding of the international 
conference to the issue of imposing sanctions on the DPRK step 
by step. 
  China still plays an important role in coping with the 
crisis. China expresses a grave worry over the DPRK's decision 
and the future development of the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Observers say that as it did before, Beijing opposes 
sanctions on the DPRK, demands the resumption of direct talks 
between Korea [choson] and the United States, and keeps silent 
on Russia's proposal for convening an international conference 
with China in attendance. In short, a complicated situation is 
prevailing. 
  However, there is still hope. This will be especially true 
if Pyongyang signals aspirations for resolving the complex knot, 
instead of bringing the issue to a deadlock.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin failed to receive Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
on Friday because he has to solve urgent problems which have 
accumulated during the three days of his absence from Moscow, a 
high-ranking Kremlin official told TASS on Friday adding that 
"there are no politics behind the cancelled meeting". 
  He added that the meeting was planned only in a preliminary 
way. "As far as the Russian-Vietnamese documents are signed at 
the level and upon mutual agreement of the prime ministers of 
both countries, Boris Yeltsin who has been absent from Moscow 
for three days, is busy with urgent state affairs today", the 
official said. He did not elaborate. 
  Yeltsin spent three days touring the Russian Far East. 
  The TASS correspondent who was at the government Vnukovo-2 
Airport on Thursday when the president returned back to Moscow 
reported that the presidential escort waited for 45 minutes 
while Yeltsin was talking right at the entrance to the airport 
with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, chief of his staff Sergey 
Filatov and Interior Minister Viktor Yerin. There was a feeling 
that a lot of questions have been awaiting the president in 
Moscow since his departure.

  [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- The problem of the use of the 
Camranh Base in Vietnam by the Russian Navy should be resolved 
on the basis of new principles in keeping with the spirit and 
demands of our time, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, who 
is on an official visit in Moscow, said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS today. 
  "The crux of the matter is that," the Vietnamese leader 
recalled, "the agreement dates back to the period, when the 
Soviet Union still existed. That is the reason today we are 
signing a new interstate treaty with the Russian side, renewing 
and improving previous accords." Vo Van Kiet did not elaborate 
on details of the agreement, but he noted that the principles it 
is based on "will conform to conditions prevailing in our both 
countries today." 
  The Camranh base on the Vietnamese coast of the South China 
Sea was modernized during the years of war waged by U.S. forces 
in Vietnam. After America's retreat from Vietnam this facility 
was changed into a material-technical support centre for the 
Soviet Union's Navy. Currently the Camranh Bay is being used by 
Russia on the basis of the agreement signed by the former Soviet 
Union and Vietnam in 1981. The validity of the agreement 
expires in 2004. The strength of the servicing Russian personnel 
has been reduced to almost the one-fourth compared with that in 
1980, and coordination with the Vietnamese side has been 
converted to commercial basis.

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told 
Interfax after talks with his Swiss counterpart Flavio Cotti 
that the drafting of the U.N. Security Council resolution on 
sanctions against North Korea was proceeding unsatisfactorily. 
  He also expressed surprise that the U.S. had circulated its 
own draft resolution which contains a list of sanctions against 
North Korea. 
  He said that this resolution went against the agreement on 
joint work, reached during recent telephone conversations 
between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. This plan was also 
confirmed during a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, said Kozyrev. 
  "We decided to work together on a resolution that would 
provide for sanctions on the one hand, and for an international 
conference on the North Korean problem on the other," he went on 
to say. "We also agreed not to advance unilateral initiatives," 
he said. 
  The American diplomats' moves complicate the solution of the 
problem, said Kozyrev. "We shall not support sanctions which 
have not been discussed with us. This will complicate the work 
of the Security Council," he added. 
  He announced that Russia had confidentially sent Americans 
its own ideas on the draft resolution which attached equal 
importance to sanctions and the international conference. 
  Kozyrev also told Interfax that during a telephone 
conversation with Christopher, he named a date for a meeting in 
accordance with the agreement reached between the Russian and 
American presidents. "Christopher will respond. I'm ready to 
meet with him at any convenient time," said Kozyrev.

  [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia and Switzerland are 
interested in seeing the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE) play a "central and increasingly important role 
on the continent", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said 
at a press conference today. He was summing up the results of 
the talks held with Switzerland's head of federal department of 
foreign affairs Flavio Cotti in Moscow today. The head of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry and his Swiss counterpart signed a 
protocol on cooperation between foreign policy departments of 
the two countries. 
  Andrey Kozyrev called Bern's stand on international issues 
"responsible and constructive". He noted that the Russian 
foreign policy has been rid of "not only of the ideology 
syndrome, but of the complex of gigantomania as well". Kozyrev 
emphasised: In Moscow we have "learnt to value a partner, even 
if it seems to be a small country." "Switzerland, which is 
situated in the very centre of Europe, is our reliable friend 
and partner", he said, ascertaining that bilateral relations are 
quite intensively developing in all directions, including 
economic". The Russian foreign minister also noted personal 
friendly relations which he had established with Flavio Cotti 
during the head of the Russian foreign department's first 
official visit to Switzerland in 1992. 
  The Russian minister said that during today's talks they 
discussed regional problems. Kozyrev highly praised activities 
of Swiss diplomat and U.N. secretary-General's special envoy in 
Georgia Edouard Brunner. He called the latter's peace efforts 
an "example of concrete participation in settling the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict together with Russia." 
  Flavio Cotti thinks that Russia's peacemaking activities, 
naturally within the framework of international decisions, are 
in common interests". According to him, envoy Brunner also 
shares this conviction. The Swiss head of department of foreign 
affairs said that he agrees to Brunner's mission in Georgia 
being extended to an additional period, and he had recently 
spoken about it to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in 
Geneva. Taking into consideration the situation in Georgia, we 
are of the view that Brunner's mandate will be more directed 
towards organizational, legal and institutional issues. Besides 
this, in Cotti's opinion, it concerns the continuation of the 
traditionally peculiar to Switzerland diplomatic activities of 
mediation and rendering good services.

Boris Krivoshey] 
  [Text] Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia should remain the 
"locomotive of reform", and the stronger the Russian state will 
be politically and economically, the better it will be for the 
other CIS countries and integration, according to Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Speaking at a Foreign Policy Council meeting devoted to 
further integration in the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
Kozyrev noted that Russia is also interested in the all-round 
strengthening of the CIS member-countries, so that she would be 
surrounded by stable states. He said Russia was ready for as 
much integration as its partners desired. 
  Kozyrev pointed out that there are a lot of far-reaching 
ideas being bandied about now, such as Kazakhstan President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal to create a Euroasian Union, or 
ideas about forming a confederation. 
  From Russia's point of view, any of these proposals would be 
acceptable. However, "it would be best to avoid a situation in 
which the proposal and discussion of such promising ideas does 
not hinder us in solving specific pressing problems, or distract 
our attention from them", Kozyrev said. He stated that it was 
most important to concentrate joint efforts on coordinating 
legislative activity and searching for ways to make the CIS 
interparliamentary assembly more effective. 
  The Foreign Policy Council's meeting was attended by 
representatives from the parliament, various ministeries and 
departments, political and public organisations, and the clergy.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Amanova and Lev Aleynik under the "Self- </F>
Determination" rubric: "National Minorities Explain Their 
Position to Council of Europe"] 
  [Text] Representatives of the Congress of Ethnic 
Associations of Russia [CEAR] met with Council of Europe experts 
in the Department for Human Rights of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The CEAR was represented by the 
German, Korean, Moldovan, Ukrainian, Polish, Karaim, Tatar, and 
Jewish communities, as well as the Ingush and Ossetian 
organizations representing the territorial "autonomous 
entities." The Council of Europe was represented by members of 
the commissions for human rights and political issues and of the 
judicial chamber. The experts were led by the head of the court 
department of the Council of Europe's human rights commission, 
Prof. Bernard, who said that "the group is here to listen rather 
than speak because Russia has started the process of joining the 
Council of Europe, and one of our tasks is to find out about the 
position of national minorities." 
  However, a number of participants in the meeting believed, 
the experts "were unprepared for it" because "national 
minorities are nonexistent as far as Russia and all its parties 
and the Council of Europe are concerned." According to 
statistics, non-Russians account for 30 percent of Russia's 
population. The notion of a "national minority" has not been 
defined in legal terms. 
  The main demands of the CEAR were expounded by, Roman 
Spektor, member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish 
Congress. The CEAR is pressing for the right of national 
minorities to be "represented in the organs of power or under 
their auspices," for which it offers to create a "consultative 
structure in the shape of an Assembly of Peoples." The second 
demand is the implementation of the right to national-cultural 
autonomy, which can be "territorial and ex-territorial." The 
CEAR is trying to "hold consultations with parties and 
democratic political movements, and it is ready to cooperate 
with them not in order to compete for seats in the Duma but 
rather in order that the parties whose electorate we are ready 
to join should take account of our interests and match them at 
the legislative level." 
  Two days after the meeting with the Council of Europe 
experts 
there was a meeting with Yegor Gaydar which discussed the 1996 
elections and the CEAR stance in them. As Mr. Spektor stated, 
"we can become partners as we cooperate on certain questions if 
some of the parties become our lobbyist."

  [Text] London June 16 TASS -- The "contact group", 
comprising Russia, the United States and the European Union is 
holding a working session in the British capital today in its 
bid to work out a peaceful solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its future constitutional and territorial 
set up. Russian presidential special envoy and Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin is taking part in the meeting. 
  The British Foreign Office told ITAR-TASS that all parties 
at 
the session are striving to agree to the last details of the 
"geographical division" map of the Former Republic of 
Yugoslavia. The whole package is to be approved at a 
minister-level meeting of Russia, the U.S., Great Britain, 
France and Germany, which is scheduled to take place within the 
next two to three weeks. 
  Later the documents, which are in informed circles regarded 
as ultimatums of their own kind, will be handed over to the 
Serbs, Croats and Moslems, the hostile sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The range of the issues discussed by the 
"contact group" is extremely complicate, the British Foreign 
Office representative noted. For this reason, the possibility 
of the talks being extended until friday cannot be ruled out, he 
indicated. 
  According to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, the 
international committee has only a few days left at its disposal 
to put an end to the Bosnian conflict. Speaking in London on 
Wednesday, Hurd noted that there exists a real danger of a new 
war braking out in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which may spill over 
beyond its borders.

  [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service and a member of Russia's Security 
Council, is on a tour of the Far East. He has arrived in 
Vladivostok from Sakhalin, where he held a news conference. 
Asked by our correspondent Sergey Padenko about the activities 
of special services of adjacent states, Sergey Stepashin said: 
  [Begin recording] [Stepashin] I will not name any names, but 
representatives of the Chinese and North Korean intelligence 
services have been very active recently in the Maritime Kray. 
They use methods of direct recruitment and especially military 
espionage. After all, Vladivostok is a military town. Narcotics 
is also involved. Despite the fact that most states surrounding 
the territory of the former Soviet Union have become our 
partners rather than potential opponents and enemies, their 
special services have become more active than before. 
  [Padenko] Here is his answer to the question about borders: 
  [Stepashin] You know the position of the Chinese side. China 
is very active on the subject and has a viewpoint of its own. I 
believe that our Foreign Ministry and those who are empowered to 
conduct negotiations on border guard troops must take a much 
tougher line. We lost our people on Damanskiy Island. We gave 
away about 1,200 islands. Therefore we will be discussing this 
at the Security Council. 
  [Padenko] And here is Sergey Stepashin's answer to the 
question about interaction between the Interior Ministry and the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
  [Stepashin] Next week Interior Minister Yerin and I will be 
signing an agreement enshrined in a range of judicial documents 
on interaction and the demarcation of powers. Several joint 
orders will also be signed. Whereas in the past there was 
competition, as you know, and sometimes even confrontation 
between the two departments, now Minister Yerin and I have 
agreed--and we will do it, I can assure you--to put a stop to 
this confrontation. Our departments will be collaborating in 
the investigation of corruption among the top ranks of state 
power. We will also be investigating a range of groups involved 
in organized crime where we have our agents and therefore have 
the opportunity to work. We will be investigating cases of 
international terrorism and international drug trafficking 
Jointly with the Interior Ministry. In addition, in the very 
near future the president will sign an edict on setting up a 
directorate and other appropriate bodies on the territory of 
operations in progress. [sentence as heard] We will also have 
the opportunity to take direct part in the detention, search 
and, if necessary, elimination of those who are breaking the law 
and encroaching on human rights and life. [end recording]

<F P=106> [V. Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F>
program] 
  [Text] China's Heilongjiang Province, which is our 
country's main partner in the PRC, is threatening to switch its 
trade contacts with Russia to the dynamically developing states 
of Southeast Asia. The province's leadership made a statement on 
revising foreign economic priorities due to the new situation in 
the region. Simply put, our Chinese neighbors are very unhappy 
about the new Russian visa regulations and new customs dues. 
These measures significantly reduced the flow of goods across 
the border -- according to Chinese sources, the reduction 
reaches 45 percent. Official Beijing has already adopted 
retaliatory measures that limit the import of raw material and 
semifinished products from Russia, and Heilongjiang firms have 
been advised to look for new foreign sources of income. Only 
time will show how real these threats of our affronted neighbors 
are, but China is far from being our only partner in Asia to 
justify our creating some kind of special conditions for it. It 
is hardly worth to dramatize the reduction of goods exchange -- 
after all, the reverse side of the frantic trade relations with 
China has amounted to the noticeable complication of the 
situation in Far East border districts. 
  The first stage of the `Foreigner' [inostranets] operation 
carried out in the Maritime Kray showed the necessity of 
tightening the monitoring of entry of Chinese, Vietnamese, and 
DPRK citizens. Many of them break visa regulations, forge 
documents, and try to stay in the Maritime Kray through fair 
means or foul. During the 10 days of purposeful inspection, 
about 1,000 foreign citizens who had broken Russia's laws were 
deported from the kray. However, the number of PRC tourists who 
have lost their way here amounts to thousands, and, therefore, 
operation `Foreigner' will not be limited to the first stage.

  Moscow June 16 TASS -- Russia is trying to maintain 
friendly relations with not only the CIS country-members, but 
with the Baltic countries as well, according to Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Kozyrev, speaking at a foreign policy council meeting on 
Thursday, said civilised dialogue was being strengthened between 
Russia and the three Baltic states. The questions of human 
rights violations and the rights of the Russian-language 
population and other minorities in the Baltic region are still 
on the agenda, he said. The Russian foreign minister noted that 
the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic 
countries would not lead to a decrease in attention paid to 
those questions.

<F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Master" column: "Yuriy </F>
Luzhkov Wants to Extend the Life of the Voucher. And Calls on 
U.S. Businessmen To Be More `Go-Go'"] 
  [Text] At a meeting with representatives of the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Russia, in Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov 
expressed regret over the fact that the U.S. business community 
is pursuing an "overcautious" line in the sphere of joint 
cooperation and investments in Russia and Moscow. After 
enumerating a number of projects executed and in the process of 
being implemented by Moscow authorities with foreign (non-U.S.) 
companies, the Moscow mayor admitted the existence of problems 
both in the legislative sphere and in ensuring security for 
businessmen, and called on representatives of U.S. business 
circles to be more forthright in pointing out existing 
shortfalls to the Moscow authorities: "We cannot be reproached 
for not wanting to listen to foreign businessmen." Yuriy 
Luzhkov described as "absurd" rumors about Moscow city officials 
demanding bribes and payoffs from U.S. business people. Talking 
about the efforts by the Moscow authorities to create a 
favorable climate for foreign investments, the Moscow mayor 
spoke about deposit funds to ensure against "force majeur" 
circumstances. According to Yuriy Luzhkov, the services sector, 
tourism, and construction are the most promising areas for 
foreign investment in Moscow. In the construction sphere alone, 
according to Luzhkov, at least $2 billion worth of investments 
is needed annually. 
  Touching on problems of crime control, Yuriy Luzhkov 
admitted 
the complexity of the current situation, noting that in the past 
year the Moscow authorities have done their utmost to improve 
the situation. According to Luzhkov, work along these lines is 
under way, but additional legislative measures are called for. 
In this connection the Moscow mayor highly appraised the latest 
presidential crime control edict. Yuriy Luzhkov denied elite 
militia formations would be created to defend entrepreneurs. 
  On the issue of his disagreements with Vice Premier Chubays, 
Yuriy Luzhkov pointed out that the president's decision about 
privatization in Moscow is a triumph not for Luzhkov but for 
common sense. Accusing "democrat Chubays" of implementing "the 
worst possible communist principles," Luzhkov declared that 
"voucher" privatization has been a flop. At the same time the 
Moscow authorities intend to find ways to remedy the situation, 
in particular, according to the Moscow mayor, by insisting that 
the life of the privatization check be extended. Furthermore, 
the Moscow authorities plan "actively and expeditiously" to 
translate into reality their own model for the second stage of 
privatization the result of which will be the sell-off of 
property to "real masters" at realistic prices.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Cherkovets: "U.S. Landing Force Rushes to </F>
Russia. If It Doesn't Work at the Center Then Try It at the 
Edge"] 
  [Text] No sooner had a report gone out in the mass media 
about a Russian military ship -- the destroyer Neustrashimyy -- 
taking part in joint naval maneuvers involving as many as 15(!) 
states in the southern part of the Baltic Sea (but against whom 
was the Neustrashimyy, together with seven NATO countries, going 
to maneuver, and into whom was it going to put fear in these 
parts?!), than new information of the same kind emerged. It 
turns out that joint exercises involving Russian and U.S. 
marines to "perfect rescue missions" are due to take place in 
the waters around Vladivostok. 
  Well, the Americans really want to step in their hobnail 
boots onto our soil! If you don't hit the bull's-eye in the 
center of Russia -- the Totskiy training ground -- then try at 
the edge. Never mind that it's 10,000 versts from Moscow, but 
what a place this is: It was a little less than 75 years ago 
that the Americans were chucked out of this very location, 
Maritime Kray, or were at least asked to leave, and now they 
will again be entering it, albeit only at its very edge. What a 
pleasure this is: To tweak the Russian bear's nose while the 
occupiers of the Kremlin are tying its paws behind its back. 
  What is significant is this. Citing AP, the MOSCOW TIMES 
newspaper reported that in the maneuvers a U.S. Navy ship should 
land 250 marines and 12 combat bridge vehicles. It has also 
been proposed to drop another 250 U.S. warriors with appropriate 
equipment on the Totskiy training ground in Orenburg Oblast. 
Does this mean that they want to insinuate by hook or by crook 
a strictly determined number of "bodies" with equipment into our 
land -- in order to perfect a particular operation? What 
particular operation?

  [Text] Bonn June 16 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian State 
Duma Ivan Rybkin who is on an official visit to Germany as the 
head of a delegation of the lower house of the Russian 
parliament, met with journalists in Bonn on Thursday. 
  "We have agreed with our German colleagues to develop close 
contacts between committees of the State Duma and the German 
Bundestag which deal with economic issues. I believe that 
Bundestag's experience in this field will be of great interest 
for us, especially in matters concerning the economic boost on 
Germany's eastern lands," Rybkin said. 
  He pointed out that during his talks with German leaders on 
Thursday the sides touched upon problems faced by Germans 
residing in Russia and Russians in Germany. "We must do our 
best so that hundreds of thousands of these people could feel at 
home both in Russia and in Germany," Rybkin said. 
  Touching upon problems existing in Russo-German relations, 
Rybkin singled out the problem of mutual return of cultural 
values, removed from Russia and Germany as a result of the 
Second World War, as the most difficult one. 
  Asked about the interaction between the Russian president 
and 
the State Duma and the extent to which the lower house of the 
Russian parliament supports the course of reforms pursued by 
Boris Yeltsin, Rybkin said that "from the very first days of our 
existence we have been acting together with the president and 
shall continue to do so in future to find a way out of the 
quagmire of the crisis".

speaker of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly said that 
during the talks a wide range of political and economic issues 
connected with relations between the two countries were touched 
upon. 
  Rybkin said Weizsaecker showed great interest in the coming

detail the economic processes that are under way in the Russian 
Federation and also the situation in the agro-industrial 
complex.

  [Text] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- The Russian Nuclear Energy 
Ministry in Moscow has denied reports by the environmental 
organization Greenpeace that plutonium fuel rods from Germany 
are to be transported to the southern Urals for use at Beloyarsk 
nuclear power station. "We have no information confirming these 
reports," a spokesman for the ministry told DDP/ADN news agency 
today in response to a query. He pointed out that it is 
"technically extremely difficult" to use foreign fuel rods in 
Russian nuclear plants. 
  Greenpeace says 123 fuel rods originally intended for use in 
a fast breeder at Kalkar are to be "disposed of" in Beloyarsk. 
It said research conducted in the southern Urals reveals that 
an Essen- based operating firm, 
Schnell-Brueter-Kernkraftwerksgesellschaft (SBK), a subsidiary 
of RWE, wants to transport the fuel rods to Beloyarsk for use in 
the BN-600 breeder, which is regarded as unsafe. Greenpeace 
bases its report on comments by the chief engineer at the power 
station. 
  A malfunction at Beloyarsk in early May resulted in a fire 
in 
the plant's third reactor which took several hours to put out. 
Radioactivity did not escape. 
  The 123 fuel rods, which Greenpeace says contain 1.1 tonnes 
of plutonium, are currently being stored in a Siemens-owned 
bunker in Hanau under federal supervision.

  [Text] Tehran, 16 Jun -- Russia will provide assistance in 
completing the construction of the nuclear power station near 
the town of Bushehr in the south of the country. At present 
Russian specialists are completing the technical research. It 
is expected the power station, which is to produce one seventh 
of Iran's demand in electricity, will be ready for operation in 
five years' time. 
  The construction of the nuclear power station was started in 
the seventies by two German companies, however it was stopped 
before the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian 
leadership wavered for a long time as to whether it would be 
expedient to complete the construction, but when Tehran decided 
in an affirmative way Germany abdicated its commitments because 
of fears that the nuclear program might acquire a military 
direction. 
  IAEA inspections to the Bushehr nuclear power station did 
not 
confirm the fears. 
  In addition to participating in the construction of the 
nuclear power station, Russia will receive a contract to build a 
gas-fired thermal power station in the same region. According 
to political observers, new Iranian-Russian relations in the 
field of power engineering will boost bilateral cooperation in 
the political and economic spheres and will also bring to Russia 
hard currency it so badly needs.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Sarishvili under "In Nearby Foreign </F>
Countries" rubric: "Risk Is Too Great"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- Let us omit the details of the story as 
a result of which your correspondent was the first Georgian 
journalist to get hold of a document sent from the Armenian 
Supreme Council and meant only for internal use in Georgia's 
supreme legislative organ. Sooner or later it would have become 
public property. We decided that sooner was better than later. 
  We know that, under a government edict [ukaz], 
recommissioning work has been under way at Metsamor AES [Nuclear 
Electric Power Station] for over a year now. Moreover, despite 
the recommendations of international organizations (the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, Framatome, and so on) it is 
envisaged that demothballing will be carried out within a 
compressed time scale. This was a forced decision, because 
Armenia has been facing an energy disaster for several years 
now, and the shipment of energy sources across Azerbaijani and 
Georgian territory has been made extremely difficult because of 
terrorist acts and the general unstable situation in the region. 
But the blood in our veins runs cold from the risk factors 
listed in the document. 
  The reactors at the Metsamor AES (of the water-cooled, 
water-moderated 440/230 type) are known for their imperfection 
and unreliability in operation. Furthermore, in the event of an 
accident there are no protection measures in the form of a 
containment vessel or underground drop-down mechanisms 
[mekhanizmy podzemnogo obrusheniya]. The problem of burying the 
radioactive waste remains an open one. Under the station there 
is a multilevel artesian well from which water is distributed 
throughout the region. Bearing in mind the current military 
situation in the region, the danger of terrorist acts is quite 
real. 
  The document, signed by S. Shaginyan, chairman of the 
Armenian commission for the protection of the environment and 
natural resources, says the following: "Total economic blockade 
has put Armenia under the threat of extinction.... Sensible 
warnings about the danger of starting up the AES receive no 
response. The situation has now gotten out of control, and the 
threat of an ecological explosion has become real." 
  In the light of all the aforementioned risk factors it 
becomes clear that starting up the AES cannot be considered 
Armenia's internal affair. Georgian ecologists are ready to 
sound the alarm. We possess another document, signed by 
Professor Tamaz Chelidze, director of the Georgian Academy of 
Sciences Geophysics Institute. It says that, according to a 
seismic zoning map in existence since 1989, the site of the 
Armenian AES falls into the category of a zone with a 9-point 
seismic risk. This figure speaks for itself. We can add to it 
that the AES is capable of meeting only 25 percent of Armenia's 
needs -- and then only for electricity; other energy sources 
will still have to be imported. So it is not too clear whether 
starting it up is economically advantageous. 
  But something else is clear: When a baby dies from the cold 
in front of your eyes (and this has happened many times in both 
Armenia and Georgia), you will not only start up the AES but you 
will also open up a Pandora's box. But maybe there is still a 
chance to take safety measures?

  [Text] Lieutenant General Leonid Ivashov, secretary of the 
Council of Defense Ministers of CIS member-states, is in favor 
of formation of "a military or a defensive union" of CIS states 
which would provide for "the creation of joint or single armed 
forces of CIS countries." 
  Speaking at the sitting of the forum Towards New Accord on 
Saturday in Moscow, Ivashov said that "such union will solve the 
problem of restoration of the spirit of confidence between the 
peoples, will prevent possible threat to CIS states, and, in 
case of an aggression, will help to repulse it by joint efforts." 
  As many as 80 representatives of 17 parties and 30 public 
organizations and movements of the former Soviet republics with 
the exception of Turkmenistan are participating in the forum. 
  Ivashov called "creation of a security system in the Asian 
region with the participation of the states neighboring CIS 
countries" among the necessary "political and legal tasks" to be 
solved in the near future. 
  In Ivashov's words, the Eastern-European system of 
collective 
security could include the armed forces of Belarus, the group of 
the Russian armed forces, and the Kaliningrad grouping which 
would subordinate "to a body like Council of Defense" headed by 
the Belarussian president. 
  He proposes "to unite military systems of three 
Transcaucasian states in the Caucasian region" with Russian 
military presence and command and control center in 
Rostov-na-Donu. 
  Military systems of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and "in 
accordance with its readiness" Turkmenistan can be united in the 
frameworks of one more military grouping. 
  The system of collective security in the Urals can include 
the armed forces of the Ural military district and the armed 
forces of Kazakhstan. 
  "Now it's time to adopt a political decision," declared 
Ivashov. However, as he said, despite the fact that "there exist 
different military threats the Russian Foreign Ministry strictly 
adheres to the position of a non-allied existence." In 
Ivashov's opinion, "when there exists one bloc (NATO - Interfax) 
which does not want to be disbanded, there is a real necessity 
in our defensive union."

<F P=106> [Report by Gleb Cherkasov under the "Intentions" rubric: </F>
"Three Parties Want To Reunite CIS Slavic Republics. Ivan 
Rybkin May Receive Their Leaders"] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Tikhonov, chairman of the "Consolidation" 
party; Igor Karpenko, leader of the "Slavic Unity of Ukraine"; 
and Nikolay Sergeyev, chairman of the "`Belaya Rus' Slavic 
Assembly" party, yesterday circulated an "Appeal to the Heads of 
State and Parliaments of the Republic of Belarus, the Russian 
Federation, and the Republic of Ukraine." The appeal contains a 
call to pass "legislative acts on the unification of the 
sovereign states to form a confederation or some other mutually 
acceptable state entity." In the opinion of its authors, "the 
creation of a confederation will make it possible to prevent 
disintegration of the unified community and to solve political, 
economic, and defense tasks." 
  Speaking at a press conference devoted to the promulgation 
of 
the appeal, the leaders of the parties stated that the 
pro-integration feeling prevalent among the peoples of the three 
countries does not always meet with adequate understanding among 
members of the political elites of Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belorussia [Belarus]. At the same time, according to the 
assurances of the "Consolidation" chairman and State Duma deputy 
Aleksandr Tikhonov, Speaker Ivan Rybkin intends to meet with the 
authors of the appeal as early as 21 June. Mr. Tikhonov thinks 
the speaker's stance is drawing closer to proposals expounded in 
the appeal. 
  As for practical steps to create a unified state entity, it 
is suggested that referendums be held in all the three republics 
following which the supreme organs of representative power could 
take specific actions to carry into effect the peoples' will. 
In the view of the authors of the appeal, the new Slavic 
statehood ought to have unified armed forces, a unified "ruble" 
system, and equality of state languages. 
  It is worth pointing out that the very fact of signing such 
an appeal is, to a certain extent, a new method in the political 
struggle both in Russia and in the Ukraine, as well as in 
Belarus. Until recently pro-integration and unification 
sentiments were mainly exploited by radical-communist and 
national-patriotic organizations, so the same sentiments 
expressed by "centrist" associations may have greater 
repercussions.

<F P=106> [Viktor Mayuchiy video report; from the "Utro" program's </F>
"Mir" feature] 
  [Text] Good morning, friends! Our greeting comes to you 
from Belarus. To be more precise, it is from that unique place 
where the borders of the three sovereign states, Russia, 
Belarus, and Ukraine, converge. 
  A meeting of the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian, and 
Belarusian Agrarian Parties took place this spring here at the 
Friendship Monument. Worldly wisdom tells us that peasants 
should be growing grain and not be engaged in politics. 
However, the reality of our life proves otherwise. 
  A number of documents that will coordinate the parties' 
activities were signed at this meeting and the opinion of those 
gathered here was that this political act today could become the 
beginning of the movement toward the re-creation of the union of 
the three Slavic states, and possibly, a single state. 
  [Begin recording] [Biryukov] These are not political 
ambitions. Even with the most cursory of analyses, we can see 
the worsening situation and the decline in the standard of 
living of the peasants, and the population of Russia in general. 
Probably the same situation exists in Belarus and Ukraine, and 
it shows that the basic reason for it is this artificial, forced 
breakdown of the former great state. 
  [Sharetskiy] The peasants are the most landed sector of the 
population and that is why we, before anyone else, sensed that 
the purely human need to produce, to recreate that which we had 
and lost. 
  [Dovgal] I think that the Belarus and Ukraine state systems 
will regenerate and strengthen if we work in a unified space 
like this. [end recording] 
  The peasant politicians' pronouncements, like the documents 
they signed, so far are nothing more that a beautiful gesture, 
the same as the sowing of seed that took place at the monument 
near the border of the three sovereign states. Belarus' and 
Ukraine's mutual relations with the third brother, Russia, will 
most probably depend to a great degree on the results of the 
presidential elections. Namely, the Belarusian and Ukrainian 
Republics' future political and economic directions will be 
determined after the elections.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA frontpages 
an article dealing with the deployment of a peace-keeping force 
in the zone of the Georgian Abkhazian conflict. The seriousness 
of the situation in central Asia and the Transcaucasian region 
cannot but worry the Russian leadership. The governments of 
Western countries should be equaqlly interested in the 
settlement of armed conflicts, specifically, in the 
Transcaucasian region, the newspaper writes. 
  "However, quite unexpectedly for us, the West assumed a 
negative stand on the issue," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA points out. 
According to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Buturs-Ghali, the 
U.N. would not object to Russia's peace-keeping efforts in the 
Transcaucasian region, but Moscow will not be given the status 
of U.N. troops. The newspaper quotes the words of Russian 
Deputy Defence Minister Georgy Kondratiev, now visiting 
Abkhazia, who emphatically refuted reports saying that the 
peace-keeping operation had already been started, and stressed 
that "the planned reconnaissance of the terrain is now under 
way, which should ensure the preparation of the peace-keeping 
operation." 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also carries a material on this subject, 
specifically, an interview with Gennadiy Fedosov, ambassador at 
large of the Russian Foregn Ministry, who believes that it is 
necessary to move Russian peace-keeping troops to the zone of 
the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. "The whole experience of the 
conflict shows that it is impossible to maintain peace, which is 
shaky enough, without a peace-keeping force," the newspaper 
writes. According to Fedosov, Russia needs peace in Abkhazia in 
no smaller degree than the conflicting parties. "Another 
outbreak of bloodshed in Abkhazia is fraught with the threat of 
a dramatic expansion of the conflict. It may easily spread 
across Georgia's borders," the newspaper stresses. 
  Aleksandr Livshits, head of a group of experts of the 
Russian 
president's administration, comments in ROSSIYSKIE VESTI on the 
president's decrees dealing with housing loans, housing 
certificates and the sale of unfinished apartment houses. In 
his opinion, the decree on housing certificates is the most 
important one, because it gives a chance to all those who want 
to buy a flat on the instalment system. "of course, additional 
instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank 
will be needed. However, a way to bringing down the acuteness 
of the housing problem has been cleared," Livshits writes. 
  TRUD carries a statement of the Russian union of 
industrialists and entrepreneurs, who express concern over the 
growth of crime and violence against Russian business people. 
"It is necessary to understand clearly that the situation is 
getting out of control, which means that extraordinary measures 
should be taken. On their part, Russian industrialists and 
entrepreneurs are ready to support any resolute steps of the 
president, the federal assembly and the government, aimed at 
imposing law and order and ensuring the guarantee of the 
individual safety of Russian citizens," the statement says. 
  "A criminal terror has swept Russia. The presidential decree 
alone is not enough to put an end to it," KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
writes. The newspaper points out that crime is threatening today 
not only the safety of individual citizens, but also the very 
foundations of Russia's statehood. This is why society is 
demanding resolute actions from the authorities. "The 
president's decree, whether it is good or bad, is actually the 
only real step taken by the authorities in this direction," the 
newspaper stresses. 
  PRAVDA continues to discuss the crime problem in the country 
and the president's decree "on urgent measures for protecting 
the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of 
organised crime." The newspaper carries an article on this 
subject by A.Murashev, former head of the Moscow Interior 
Ministry department and now deputy to the State Duma from the 
Russia's Choice Movement. According to Murashev, "the decree 
will not affect in any way the organised crime. It will affect, 
in the first place, ordinary business people and will become an 
extremely dangerous weapons for settling scores between them." 
  Touching upon this subject, NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA 
quotes 
the opinion of Issa Kostoev, chairman of the committee for 
constitutional legislation and judicial and legal issues at the 
Federation Council. He points out that "some of the provisions 
of the decree are obviously at variance with the Constitution 
and the criminal procedure code of the Russian Federation" and 
expresses hope that the prosecutor-general's Office, the 
Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
will issue instruction, which will rule out a possibility of the 
abuse of power by the authorities.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Igor Porshnev, </F>
Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksander Panov 
told Interfax that although Pyongyang's withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency complicated matters, Russia 
kept effective its call for an international conference on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  In case no diplomatic solution was found for the nuclear 
problem, Panov said, the UN Security Council should attach equal 
importance to the call for an international conference and 
possible sanctions against Pyongyang. Panov saw the problem as 
extremely delicate. 
  He reminded Interfax that last year Pyongyang declared its 
decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
One day before it was legally entitled to act on it, Pyongyang 
suspended its decision. In other words, Panov said, it remained 
party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  According to Panov, it was not Pyongyang's decision to 
withdraw from the IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that 
called for sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a 
country for this kind of decisions, Panov said, because any 
country was privileged to join a treaty or withdraw from it. 
  According to Panov, the international community was 
discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and 
cooperate with the IAEA. Day in and day out it remembered to 
attach conditions to whether it would or would not allow 
inspections of this or that facility, which translated, 
according to Panov, into a refusal to meet its pledges under the 
treaty and IAEA regulations even though it remained party to the 
treaty and a member of the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA failed 
to get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and 
moved to raise the issue of sanctions. 
  No IAEA report claimed Pyongyang had enough plutonium to 
produce nuclear weapons. The IAEA only stated its inability to 
get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program, Panov 
said. 
  In Panov's view, the possible introduction of anti-Pyongyang 
sanctions should be, if anything, gradual. Instead of being 
tough, the sanctions ought to spell a word of warning. They 
must remind Pyongyang that the international community meant 
business and wanted it to comply in good faith with its 
commitments. The further course of action would depend on 
Pyongyang. 
  Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested 
in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for 
an international conference gained growing support, he said. 
  Panov saw media reports on plans for President Yeltsin's 
visit to South Korea as premature. The recently-held 
Russian-Korean summit failed to discuss that issue in detail, he 
said, although President Kim Yong-sam had, indeed, invited his 
Russian counterpart to visit Seoul and the invitation had been 
accepted. The two national leaders agreed, though, Panov said, 
that diplomatic officers would discuss when exactly the visit 
was to take place.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Jun -- Qian Qichen, PRC State Council 
vice premier and foreign minister, will within the next few days 
visit the Russian capital. Andrey Kozyrev informed State Duma 
deputies of this on Friday. 
  Asked at what level and with what effectiveness the 
situation 
concerning the Korean Peninsula is being discussed with Beijing, 
the Russian foreign minister said in particular, that there is a 
regular exchange of views. Over the past two years alone the 
head of Russia's foreign policy department "has had five or six 
meetings with the PRC foreign minister, and on each occasion 
this problem was discussed." 
  "Like Russia," A. Kozyrev said, "China is also definitely 
against the DPRK breaking with the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime and in favor of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. In 
other words, it favors neither one of the Korean states 
possessing or taking steps to possess nuclear weapons." 
According to the minister "this is the fundamental basis of the 
coincidence and fundamental closeness of the approaches of 
Russia and the PRC." Of course, he went on to say, there are 
nuances of detail and tactics, but in the main the positions of 
the two countries coincide.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev has refuted claims that Russia will not prolong 
the treaty on friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with 
the DPRK whose validity term expires in two years. No decisions 
to the effect have been taken, the minister told Duma deputies 
here today. 
  "The question of treaty prolongation will be raised in fall 
1995," said the minister. In his words, the Russian president 
will take a decision after possible consultations with the 
parliament. 
  A more updated interpretation of the treaty, including 
Article 1, with due account of today's realities is being 
discussed, he added. The thing is that some document wordings 
"reflected political thinking of two socialist states and 
include terms of that period -- on protection of common 
socialist values and so on. That is why, we certainly have a 
modern interpretation of the treaty text," said the minister.

  [Text] Moscow, 17 Jun -- The nuclear problem on the Korean 
Peninsula "contains a potential direct threat to the national 
security and state interests of the Russian Federation," Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said at the State Duma today. 
  First, he noted, what is involved here are steps to violate 
the nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime in a direct 
proximity to our borders, on the Korean Peninsula, where the 
situation is tense at times as it is. Therefore, the 
possibility of a nuclear state appearing in a zone of tension 
directly affects our security and interests. The second 
circumstance, in his words, is the fact that, apart from the 
DPRK, there is a "whole number of states that are on the 
threshold of adopting similar decisions aimed at acquiring 
nuclear weapons in one way or another." 
  "If one state," the minister continued, "is allowed to 
embark 
on this road and follow it through from start to finish, in 
other words, if one begins by violating the monitoring regime, 
then leaves the treaty and acquires nuclear weapons, there is no 
way other states could be kept away from this." But the "most 
unpleasant" thing, he stressed, is that the potential possessors 
of nuclear weapons are in conflict zones, moreover, the 
overwhelming majority of them are situated in a direct proximity 
to the Russian or CIS borders. Therefore, Kozyrev said, "what 
is important for us is not only the Korean issue but the 
precedent itself, and we cannot allow it to happen." 
  The international community has various means at its 
disposal 
with which to convince the DPRK to refrain from further hasty 
steps. First and foremost there are diplomatic contacts, which 
are now being exploited to the full, including those between 
Moscow and Pyongyang. The minister went on to recall Russia's 
proposal to convene an international conference on security and 
the nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula. 
  "One of the most extreme methods for exerting influence in 
such cases is to impose international sanctions in accordance 
with a decision by the Security Council," Andrey Kozyrev said. 
"It is quite obvious that if the DPRK goes as far as wrecking 
the nonproliferation regime and providing itself with nuclear 
weapons, then the international community, we included, will 
have no other option than to use the extreme method, that is, to 
impose sanctions." 
  Nevertheless, we believe that their introduction should be 
only gradual, the minister continued. "We should begin from the 
milder sanctions of a warning nature," Andrey Kozyrev said. 
"Considering the present circumstances, the Security Council 
should work in two directions: Preparing an international 
conference and, at the same time, defining the possible range of 
sanctions that may be applied if the DPRK fails to reconsider 
its policy."

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev got a letter on Friday from United States 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher with information about 
ex-President Jimmy Carter's trip to North Korea. Kozyrev told 
State Duma deputies that the letter was evidence of "an 
intensive exchange of information through diplomatic channels" 
about the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The former U.S. President met with the higher leadership of 
North Korea, including President Kim Il-song. As Christopher's 
message states, Carter's private mission seems to have given 
rise to some hope that the North Korean side is closer to an 
agreement with the world community concerning verification of 
its nuclear sites. 
  "I think that can only be welcomed," said Kozyrev. He also 
added that Christopher, besides describing the results of the 
mission, cautioned that all the circumstances have yet to be 
made completely clear.

<F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report in the "Position" column: "Andrey </F>
Kozyrev: Hopeful Signs Are Emerging"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
has described the situation around the DPRK as "tense." 
According to him, Pyongyang's actions "contain a potential of 
direct threat to Russia's security." This concerns its 
statements on pulling out from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and the IAEA (true, no official documents have been 
submitted yet) as well as the North Korean specialists' recent 
"reloading" of their nuclear reactors, which, experts believe, 
makes their inspection virtually impossible. 
  The minister said yesterday in the State Duma that the 
emergence of a nuclear state in a "zone of tension," such as the 
Korean Peninsula, and also in immediate proximity to our 
borders, directly affects Russian interests. The situation is 
complicated by the fact that the majority of "threshold" states 
(i.e., those that are practically ready to produce nuclear 
weapons) are located close to Russian Federation borders. So 
far, Andrey Kozyrev said, they do not announce their nuclear 
status, and it is important that "none of them should openly 
defy the nonproliferation regime." "A precedent would be 
impermissible," he stressed. According to the minister, we 
already have a neighbor comparable in its nuclear-space 
potential to the "superpowers" (presumably India -- P. Zh.). 
  One of the last resorts to influence North Korea, Kozyrev 
said, are sanctions, and if "the DPRK goes to the end in 
withdrawing from the nonproliferation regime, then the 
international community will simply have nothing left to do" but 
apply them. Talking about the position of China (which has so 
far objected to sanctions), the minister noted that the PRC 
unequivocally favors a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and here 
"our positions coincide," although "there are nuances about the 
details." 
  At the same time, Andrey Kozyrev stated, Russia continues to 
insist on an international conference on the DPRK. Therefore 
there is no question about an immediate imposition of sanctions 
so far. Especially considering that, according to Kozyrev, 
"signs for a hopeful turn of events seem to be emerging." The 
Russian minister was advised about them by his U.S. counterpart 
Warren Christopher, who was briefed by Jimmy Carter upon the 
latter's return from the DPRK.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs, </F>
by Leonid Mlechin; place and date not given: "The North Korean 
Lobby in the Duma Is Acting Against Russia's Interests, Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Who Granted an Interview to 
IZVESTIYA Correspondent Leonid Mlechin, Believes"] 
  [Text] [Mlechin] Does North Korea really represent a 
serious danger, and could it become a second Iraq, against which 
the United Nations had to wage war? 
  [Kozyrev] I do not believe that North Korea already 
possesses a nuclear bomb or will create one tomorrow. Experts 
reckon that this would take Pyongyang between three and seven 
years. 
  [Mlechin] Do other Russian departments, which also take an 
interest in international affairs and security problems, hold 
the same view? 
  [Kozyrev] I rely on all information coming into Moscow, and 
not just the information which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
possesses. 
  [Mlechin] Do military and political intelligence familiarize 
you with all the information that they possess? 
  [Kozyrev] I believe that they familiarize only the president 
with all the information. We, incidentally, do just the same 
thing. But we have now arranged a normal mutual exchange. 
  [Mlechin] Is President Yeltsin dealing with the Korean 
crisis, or is this a third-rate problem for him? 
  [Kozyrev] The president himself had talks with South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam. Then he spoke with him by telephone. 
He has also spoken with President Clinton. Boris Yeltsin 
approved our proposals, conveyed to the Americans, down to the 
last comma. Much presidential time has already been spent on 
this crisis. 
  [Mlechin] Does the Russian leadership hold a unanimous 
viewpoint on the policy toward the DPRK, or do disagreements 
exist? 
  [Kozyrev] A unanimous viewpoint. 
  [Mlechin] Is it possible to speak of the existence of a 
pro-North Korean lobby in Moscow? 
  [Kozyrev] It exists in the Duma. They are ultranationalists 
and a certain section of the Communists and Agrarians. I have 
been struck for the umpteenth time by the perverted nature of 
their ideas of patriotism. Maybe these people proceed from the 
premise that the North Korean regime is so good that the bomb 
would only be good for it -- one bomb more in the socialist 
camp, after all.... But it is striking that ideological 
sympathies can make people forget the interests of their own 
country. Do they really not understand that, after North Korea, 
nuclear weapons would be acquired by regimes which are certainly 
not socialist and which would threaten our country too? 
  [Mlechin] If Kim Il-song does not have the bomb, why is the 
world so alarmed? 
  [Kozyrev] The chief danger is that the DPRK wants to pull 
out of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 
The nonproliferation setup has hitherto been considered 
unshakable. 
  [Mlechin] How does this threaten Russia's interests? 
  [Kozyrev] First, the Korean Peninsula is, if you like, the 
near abroad for Russia. 
  Second, if even one country refuses to observe the 
nonproliferation regime and gets away with it, then a chain 
reaction can be expected. Some states are lying in wait, 
waiting for their turn to come. Unfortunately, they are strung 
out along the perimeter of Russia's borders or, at any rate, the 
borders of the CIS. A nuclear belt could be formed along 
Russia's southern borders by the end of this millennium. 
  [Mlechin] What is your attitude to the prospect of 
sanctions? 
  [Kozyrev] If the DPRK is stubborn and inflexible, if it 
refuses to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, and if it withdraws from the Nonproliferation Treaty, 
then sanctions are inevitable. We advocate their phased 
introduction. We should start with a selection of "soft" 
sanctions. Then, if these prove ineffective, we should move up 
to tough sanctions. At the same time, we need to draw up a list 
of sanctions and to prepare for the international conference 
proposed by us on the problems of the Korean Peninsula. 
  [Mlechin] What is the purpose of the conference? 
  [Kozyrev] The DPRK uses various political reasons to justify 
its actions. Of course, the nonproliferation regime makes no 
exceptions -- the domestic or foreign problems of a state 
hankering after nuclear weapons are not an issue. There are no 
circumstances that would justify the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons. 
  But the DPRK is experiencing some real political 
difficulties. And the United States, which is the main butt of 
Pyongyang's criticism, acknowledges this. So it has entered 
into talks with the North Koreans. It is an entirely pragmatic 
and versatile approach. 
  [Mlechin] How soon can sanctions be imposed? 
  [Kozyrev] It will take around a month's work for the experts 
to prepare the package of sanctions. There is no hurry. The 
sanctions must be mild at the initial stage not only for the 
DPRK, but also for those imposing them. Preventive sanctions 
must represent as small as burden as possible for Russia. 
  [Mlechin] When will your meeting with the U.S. secretary of 
state take place? 
  [Kozyrev] On 13 June President Yeltsin and President Clinton 
instructed me and Secretary of State Warren Christopher to meet 
as quickly as possible and agree on all this. We were in touch 
on the telephone the same day. I had the idea of meeting in 
Brussels in the next few days and, at the same time, finally 
signing there the "Partnership for Peace" program and launching 
the "Russia-NATO" program. We would be able to finalize the 
document in a couple of nights. But the secretary of state said 
that he had a very busy schedule, so the meeting was postponed 
until next week. In the meantime we agreed to give the job to 
the Russian and U.S. representatives in New York. But there too 
there was an unexpected problem. 
  We passed our proposals to the Americans on 15 June in a 
confidential form, since we had agreed to exchange proposals 
without making them public, to promulgate only the general 
position. The next day we suddenly discovered that the 
Americans had already distributed their own draft resolution 
among the permanent members of the Security Council together 
with a list of proposed sanctions that no one had discussed. 
  And it was done in such a way that I was informed of the 
appearance of this draft by our representative in New York, 
Yuliy Vorontsov, two hours after it was reported by CNN. When 
Christopher called me and said he was prepared to meet on 21-22 
June... 
  [Mlechin] In Brussels? 
  [Kozyrev] Yes, he accepted that idea... I expressed 
bewilderment over the strange way in which the U.S. mission at 
the United Nations operates and said that we find it hard even 
to take this document seriously, because we had agreed on 
something else. It is a further example of the hiccups that can 
occur in relations with the Americans, when top-level accords 
are undermined by stupid actions. 
  [Mlechin] North Korea wants to deal with the Americans. 
Russia appears to be impeding the Americans. And the proposal 
to hold a conference is something no one particularly wants. So 
Russia would seem to be on the sidelines... 
  [Kozyrev] I am actually pleased we are not directly involved 
in this squabble. Part of our society has an inferiority 
complex: It thinks we should be first everywhere and in all 
things. First in ballet, in space, in trade. But not in 
international scandals. Better to stand aside and say nothing. 
Our role is to secure the adoption of a sensible resolution in 
the UN Security Council. 
  [Mlechin] Isn't the talk of sanctions rather abstract -- 
since China would veto such a proposal? 
  [Kozyrev] Absolutely right. Therefore submitting a draft 
resolution with a specific list of sanctions means running into 
a categorical "no" from China. So our conference proposal is 
more pragmatic. We should not present one another with a fait 
accompli, we must work together, and that includes working with 
China. 
  [Mlechin] Can one seriously expect sanctions to influence 
Kim Il-song and his son? 
  [Kozyrev] Ultimately the sanctions will bite. 
  [Kozyrev] In the case of Iraq, the international community 
still had to resort to military action. 
  [Kozyrev] For the DPRK to develop a bomb it must mobilize 
its entire potential, but sanctions will damage its economy. 
Anyway, what choice does the international community have left? 
Either it does nothing at all, or its responds in some way. Of 
course, sanctions are not an ideal response, but an extreme 
measure. But what is the ideal response? Military intervention? 
  [Mlechin] If the sanctions do not work, will the world 
settle sooner or later on the need to stop nuclear weapon 
development in North Korea by military means? 
  [Kozyrev] It is too early to discuss this. I repeat once 
again: An international conference is a realistic proposal, not 
fantasy. 
  [Mlechin] There are rumors that Boris Yeltsin is prepared to 
meet with Kim Il-song. Are there any grounds for these rumors? 
  [Kozyrev] I know nothing of this. 
  [Mlechin] At what level are you conducting a dialogue with 
North Korea? 
  [Kozyrev] We have an embassy in Pyongyang. There is a North 
Korean embassy here. 
  [Mlechin] Are Russian diplomats in Pyongyang in contact with 
sufficiently senior officials? 
  [Kozyrev] We have normal contacts.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russia has expanded its 
formula of the international conference on security and 
non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula. Moscow thinks that 
the forum can be attended by other interested states, including 
France, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told State Duma 
deputies here today. 
  "We have suggested the international conference in order to 
discuss the nuclear problem and security on the Korean 
peninsula, do away with any concerns of the DPRK as regards its 
security," said the minister. 
  "We have suggested a conference with a clear number of 
participants. These are, first of all, Russia. It is also the 
United States which concern most of the claims of the DPRK. 
These are China and the neighbouring states of Japan and the 
Republic of Korea. Other states, including France, have shown 
their interest in the conference." 
  In the opinion of Andrey Kozyrev, France can participate in 
the forum "the more so it is a nuclear power and a permanent 
member of the Security Council."

  [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- "The North Korean [DPRK] 
Embassy in Moscow does not have to worry: None of its staffers 
have been `recently' expelled from Russia or will be expelled in 
the near future. The stir about diplomat-spies was caused by 
misinterpretation," head of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service's public relations center Aleksandr Mikhailov told 
ITAR-TASS today commenting on media reports about the expel of 
North Korean Embassy staffers from Moscow. 
  In the words of Mikhailov, currently on a Far Eastern trip 
together with service head Sergey Stepashin, the latter has 
noted the recently-boosted intelligence activities of some 
secret services, including those of North Korea, China and 
Japan. Stepashin thinks a reason for this is the location of 
Russian nuclear-powered submarine fleet in the region. 
  As for the North Korean diplomats expelled for the attempts 
to purchase materiel, it was really so, said Mikhailov. The 
Russian counterintelligence, intelligence and border guards held 
an operation to prevent drug trafficking from the DPRK to Russia 
before the arrival of Stepashin in the Far East. Some could mix 
the two events which resulted in misunderstanding, said 
Mikhailov.

energy, by NHK Russian Bureau Chief Kazuo Kobayashi on 17 June; 
place not given; from NHK news -- Mikhaylov in Russian with 
Japanese translation provided in subtitles; translated from the 
subtitles] 
  [Text] Regarding North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development, Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Mikhaylov 
disclosed his belief on 17 June that North Korea needs more than 
10 years before being able to acquire nuclear weapons. He then 
criticized the movement to impose sanctions, saying that the 
international community should not isolate North Korea. 
  Energy Minister Mikhaylov explained his understanding of the 
attitude of North Korea, which rejected IAEA inspections, saying 
that the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is making 
excessive demands on North Korea. On the current state of North 
Korea's nuclear arms development, he said as follows: 
  [Begin Mikhaylov recording] I believe that North Korea does 
not have nuclear weapons. It will take them from 10 to 20 
years, even if they begin producing nuclear weapons right now. 
[end recording] 
  [Begin Kobayashi recording] Russia is opposing the movement 
in the United States and other countries to impose sanctions 
against North Korea. Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that no 
prior consultations had been made with Russia regarding concrete 
proposals on the sanctions. However, the foreign minister's 
opposition and Energy Minister Mikhaylov's recent remarks 
reflect their twisted feelings that Russia is being treated 
lightly. 
  Russia is saying that not isolating North Korea is a better 
approach. This is the outcome of such a stance, and is Russia's 
appeal and advice to the international community. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Solton from "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] The UN Security Council began to discuss the U.S. 
draft resolution calling for sanctions on Korea because it 
rejected the international inspection of its nuclear sites and 
withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
Station commentator Solton writes as follows. 
  Pyongyang still has a chance to avoid sanctions. This is 
possible if Korea changes its present position of encouraging 
suspicion that it already has a nuclear weapon or intends to 
have one. 
  The Moscow proposal for the convocation of a multilateral 
meeting is producing results. This meeting will be able to 
prevent sanctions. The international meeting can formulate 
measures for effective steps that will safeguard the sovereignty 
and security of the North and the South on one hand, and ensure 
the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula on the other hand. 
  Pyongyang and many other countries admit the appropriateness 
of the meeting, but the Korean action, particularly the 
withdrawal from the IAEA, leads people to suspect that it is 
leading to the North's withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. If this is true, the international 
community has no alternative but to resort to sanctions. This 
development is very disadvantageous. Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev agrees. 
  The resolution is to contain such measures as an arms 
embargo, restriction of financial transactions, and suspension 
of UN assistance. Yet even if this resolution is adopted, the 
sanctions will be taken not at one stroke but step by step. 
  Pyongyang has time to prove to all people that its nuclear 
project is peace-oriented. Wielding weapons affecting not only 
Pyongyang, but Washington and Seoul as well, can bring about 
consequences seriously aggravating the situation on the Korean 
peninsula and the entire Northeast Asian region .

<F P=106> [Commentary by (Krichevskiy) from the "Focus on Asia" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The DPRK has withdrawn from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Sanctions against the DPRK are 
being prepared. How to settle this problem peacefully is still 
the focus of international attention. 
  Regarding this, station commentator (Krichevskiy) writes: 
  "To be or not to be, that is the question." The statement 
Prince Hamlet asked himself in the famous tragedy written by 
William Shakespeare is well suited to the current Korean issue. 
That is, the question is to impose sanctions or not to impose 
sanctions. 
  The United States and some other countries are in a hurry. 
They have already drafted a resolution on phased sanctions. 
The draft is going to be discussed by the UN Security Council. 
It expects a gradual retrenchment of relations with the DPRK 
[chosongwaui yongyerul tangyebyollo chuksohal kosul naedabogo 
issumnida] in various fields, such as embargo of weapon exports 
and suspension of all financial business with Pyongyang. This 
may result in a blockade [i modun kosun pongswaerul choraehal su 
issumnida]. 
  Russia expressed regrets over the DPRK withdrawal from the 
IAEA. Russia is invariably insisting that the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] must be strengthened. Moscow has 
proposed an international conference of representatives from 
Russia, the United States, China, the IAEA, and the United 
Nations. 
  Regarding sanctions, Russia views that the so-called 
sanctions should be imposed as the last resort [choehu sudan] 
under the prevailing situation. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev said on 15 June that imposing sanctions on the DPRK 
would make the situation develop into extremely unfavorable 
conditions [sabyonui kukhi pullihan palchon], such as the DPRK's 
complete withdrawal from the NPT. 
  China assessed the DPRK withdrawal from the IAEA as an 
extremely unfavorable turning point [satae palchonui kukhi 
pullihan chonhwanuro pyongga] and appealed to the United States 
to maintain tranquility [pyongon]. 
  In light of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman's recent 
statement, Beijing is resolutely opposing sanctions and still 
expects the resumption of peace dialogue between the DPRK and 
the United States. Regarding this, however, China does not 
mention any specific grounds for the possibility of resuming 
dialogue between them. Observers pay attention to Beijing's 
stern denial of the report that it will render military 
assistance to Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikolayev and Pavel Vasilyev: "Why Viktor </F>
Chernomyrdin Is Heading Abroad"] 
  [Text]A Commission in the United States 
  Ridding ourselves as rapidly as possible of Cold War relics 
in the sphere of Russian-American business cooperation -- both 
sides have been working on a solution to this highly important 
task in recent years. The working trip to the United States by 
Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin 21-23 June could be the next step 
along this road. On this occasion the government head is acting 
in the role of co-chairman of the Russian-American 
Intergovernmental Commission for Economic and Technological 
Cooperation. He will participate in its third session, to be 
held at Washington's Jackson Place Conference Center. 
  According to advance information from reliable sources, in 
contrast with the two previous sessions this meeting will not 
only embrace a wider range of questions but will also proceed 
without previously prepared draft decisions on the issues under 
discussion: These will be hammered out in the course of debate 
and reached through consensus. So the experts will have to 
sweat it out a little and put in some solid work. The sides' 
efforts will be concentrated in six committees: space, energy, 
defense sector conversion, the development of business 
cooperation, ecology, and science and technology. 
  The forthcoming business meeting, as we can see, promises to 
be highly interesting and productive. Its results will be 
expressed not so much in the specific value of prospective deals 
as in the content of the talks: the thrust lies in developing 
an all-round Russian-American partnership and establishing a 
balance of interests in various spheres. 
  In this sense the Committee for Business Cooperation headed 
by Ministers Oleg Davydov and Ronald Brown is of vital 
significance. Its field of vision embraces reciprocal access to 
the two countries' markets and customs, taxation, and 
export-import policy. We, of course, are interested in securing 
recognition -- which we already have from the EU -- of Russia's 
status as a country with a transitional economy. The American 
side wants to break into the Russian market. At the same time 
it is noted that our products are more competitive than 
America's, as they cost less owing to cheap labor. 
  It is planned to sign a number of agreements. But it is 
still too early to talk about them. Nevertheless, experts 
preparing the working documents believe that it could prove 
possible, for example, to sign a treaty on the construction of 
an international space station (the United States is prepared to 
allocate $400 million for the first two stages of the project). 
  The upcoming three days of talks will be complex because 
eventual agreement will depend not only on the degree of mutual 
understanding between the Russian and American administrations. 
Here, indeed, in the experts' view, very few difficulties arise. 
However, finance for the programs lies in the hands of Congress: 
Its viewpoint on Russian-American cooperation differs somewhat 
from that of Bill Clinton's team. Our premier, as is obvious 
from the preliminary program for the trip, does have a chance to 
meet with the U.S. congressmen, to talk to America's business 
community about the projects under preparation, and to harness 
their support in favor of plans to deepen the bilateral 
partnership. 
  It looks as though Viktor Chernomyrdin's U.S. visit will be 
packed with meetings with business people and invitations from 
top companies and corporations. The program's details are still 
being finalized but even now, on the eve of the trip, it is 
quite clear that some tricky work and a packed and hectic 
schedule await the Russian premier. 
<H5>  ...And a Congress in Italy </H5>
  On his way to the United States Viktor Chernomyrdin will 
stop 
off in Italy to address participants in the 19th International 
Gas Congress, to be held 20-23 June in Milan. 
  The largest delegation at this forum will probably be from 
Russia. Apart from Viktor Chernomyrdin himself, Rem Vyakhirev, 
president of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint Stock Company, is also 
expected to deliver a speech. The conference participants have 
a special interest in Russia because Russia supplies the bulk of 
Europe's gas. It is characteristic that the conference 
participants include representatives not only from countries 
producing gas but from those consuming it too. 
  It is not ruled out that while in Milan the Russian premier 
could meet with his Italian counterpart, Silvio Berlusconi.

  [Text] Russian Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is 
confident that next July the G-7 countries will grant Russia 
political membership of their club. The Big Seven are planning 
to hold a summit conference in Naples. 
  Talking to newsmen Sunday at a Moscow airport before 
boarding 
a flight for Milan where he is to attend a session of the World 
Gas Union, Chernomyrdin said there was a direct link between his 
trip to Milan and the Naples summit. He said he would discuss 
Russian membership of the G-7 club with his Italian counterpart 
Silvio Berlusconi who is to chair the Naples summit. 
  When he visited Washington on June 21, Chernomyrdin would 
discuss the issue with President Clinton. He felt there were no 
obstacles for Russian integration into the G-7 club. 
  According to Chernomyrdin Russia wait with a request for 
economic membership of the G-7 club. Moscow realized, he said, 
that it could be invited to work on political issues first and 
only then join G-7 economic efforts. 
  In Milan Chernomyrdin would be planning to discuss Russian- 
Italian relations with Prime-Minister Berlusconi and clear up 
where the two countries stood on the package of agreements he 
signed in Italy last January.

  [Text] As he visits the United States on June 21 to 26, 
Russian Prime-Minister Chernomyrdin will raise the problem of 
discriminatory restrictions in trade relations with Russia. 
  Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before 
boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the United States 
had failed to meet its year-old pledge to lift all restrictions 
on trade with Russia. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, that although the United States 
suffered as much damage from the Jackson-Vanik amendment as 
Russia did, it kept stalling with moves to repeal it. [sentence 
as received] 
  Chernomyrdin said Russia wanted equitable relations with, 
and 
no special privileges from, the US. It would not tolerate 
discrimination, he said. Chernomyrdin hoped to find a solution 
to that problem during his visit to the United States. 
  His plans to visit the Livermore nuclear center proved, 
Chernomyrdin said, what progress Russian-US relations had made. 
Chernomyrdin will be the first Russian leader to visit the top 
secret center. 
  Chernomyrdin and the US leaders will be expected to focus on 
formerly "unmentionable" issues on the order of nuclear 
cooperation.

Russia and the world have broad prospects for developing diverse 
economic and political cooperation. We cannot go without each 
other," said Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, speaking at 
the opening ceremony of the 19th World Gas Congress here on 
Monday. 
  The premier stressed that Moscow is waiting for concrete 
proposals from the G7 countries on cooperation in regulating 
investment flows and on development of adequate and specific 
mechanisms for their encouragement and insurance. 
  "Russia wants that the partners in the coming Naples summit 
should recognise it as `a country with a transition economy' and 
made new concrete moves to improve conditions of access of its 
goods to foreign markets," Chernomyrdin said. 
  "I'm sure that the turning of the G7 into a G8 will bring 
about basically important and positive changes in the 
geopolitical balance and create new favourable conditions for 
Russia's full-fledged participation in the world economic 
system."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Bychkov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 18 June -- Russia and Vietnam consider the 
results of Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's official 
visit to Moscow, which ended 17 June, on the whole to be 
successful. Russia and Vietnam converge in the opinion that the 
visit will contribute to future progress in Russo-Vietnamese 
relations, upgrading them significantly, says a report 
distributed to the press by the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs today. 
  The ministry notes that the treaty signed by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Federation Government, and 
Vo Van Kiet on the bases of friendly relations between the 
Russian Federation and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam 
"formulates the basic principles of cooperation between the two 
countries in light of the changes that have occurred both in 
Russia and Vietnam and in the international arena on the whole." 
  Also taking into account the three intergovernmental 
agreements concluded, which regulate capital investment problems 
and matters of cooperation in areas such as fishing and the 
agroindustrial complex, Russia and Vietnam now have 
approximately 15 intergovernmental documents, the result of work 
over the past two and a half years. 
  However, Moscow and Hanoi do not intend to stop there. The 
two countries' governments have thought it expedient to continue 
work on compiling a list of the treaties, agreements, and other 
intergovernmental documents concluded between the former USSR 
and Vietnam. It is planned to step up efforts to implement 
existing agreements in practice. 
  The fuel and power complex, including hydroelectricity, was 
described at the talks as being among the most promising areas 
of cooperation. The press release stresses that cooperation 
between individual regions of the two countries, particularly 
the Russian Far East and Vietnamese provinces, occupies an 
important place in the development of Russo-Vietnamese 
relations. 
  In discussing the international situation, the governmental 
heads of Russia and Vietnam confirmed that their views either 
coincided or were close on most of today's most urgent problems 
and called for the expansion of constructive cooperation aimed 
at creating a new, nonconfrontational system of interstate 
relations in the Asia- Pacific Ocean area and Southeast Asia, in 
particular. 
  Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Nyugen Manh Cam went 
into greater detail on matters of international politics. They 
exchanged opinions on specific ways of coordinating the work of 
the Foreign Ministries "under the conditions of perceived 
changes for the better in the international climate."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey Krasnoshchekov </F>
and Konstantin Pribytkov] 
  [Text] Crans-Montana (Switzerland) June 18 TASS -- The West 
should switch from aid to East European countries to mutually 
advantageous and equal cooperation with them, Speaker of the 
Byelorussian [Belarus] parliament Mechyslav Hryb said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS here on Saturday. 
  According to the speaker, equality in trade and economic 
relations should mean, above all, "an increase or complete 
abrogation by the West of export quotas", since only this can 
evoke interest from both sides. 
  The idea of the need for establishing equal partnership 
between East and West European countries key-noted the first two 
days of the international forum in Crans-Montana devoted to 
East-West relations. Forum participants spoke about this at 
plenary meetings, seminars and at intervals between sessions. 
  In turn, Ivan Korotchenya, executive secretary of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), said in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS that the West's aid was inefficient to a great 
extent. For instance, the refusal by Byelorussia to take 
humanitarial aid has not virtually affected the situation in the 
republic in any way. 
  Therefore, he noted, relations between CIS republics and 
Western partners should be built on quite another basis: to 
develop contacts at all levels --from small enterprises to 
state-owned companies. "It is humiliating for our states to 
receive just aid," the executive secretary said. 
  The forum is discussing specific projects of cooperation. 
Korotchenya said that some delegations from CIS countries are 
already discussing proposals from potential Western partners. 
  Speaking at a plenary meeting, Swiss Economics Minister 
Jean-Pascal Delamuraz noted that success of international 
cooperation would be determined, above all, by stability in East 
European countries and consistency with which they would pursue 
reforms. 
  Interdependence of the countries in the old world has 
graphically demonstrated itself: The economic slump in the West 
negatively told on export opportunities from Eastern Europe. 
  Commercial relations is an important factor for economic 
growth. "Therefore, our aim should be the development of trade 
with the East and not aid," he summed up his speech. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Moldavian [Moldova] 
President 
Mircea Snegur called attention to the fact that the present 
forum considerably differs from other similar meetings: It 
examines not only economic but also political problems. 
  "Economic reforms and the development of relations are 
linked 
here directly with measures to ensure political stability on the 
continent," he stressed. This is of great interest for 
Moldavia, since "it is forced to overcome the consequences of a 
short armed conflict in 1992 up to this time".

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Yuriy Kozlov] 
  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- Russia cannot afford not to 
hold the peace-making operation in Abkhazia, a zone historically 
close to it and an area of its major and comprehensive 
interests, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told the 
State Duma deputies here today. One cannot abandon peoples 
Russia lived with in one state in the recent past, he added. 
  Preparations for the Commonwealth peace-making operation, 
whose core will be Russian servicemen, have begun. This will be 
done on request of the Georgian Government and the Abkhazian 
leadership. The operation will aim to prevent new clashes, 
ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and peaceful life in the 
area. 
  The peace-making mission in Abkhazia is absolutely lawful, 
said the minister. Russia does not need any additional powers 
or "legitimization". An appeal of the sides, including the 
legitimate government of the sovereign state, and a decision of 
the Russian constitutional bodies, including the president and 
the Federation Council, are enough. 
  Kozyrev hopes that the Russian parliament's upper chamber to 
re- consider the issue in the immediate future will view the 
problem in the light of Russian state interests. One should not 
forget that there is no vacuum in such situations, if Russia 
refuses to play its geo-political role, there will be others 
wishing to bring order in "our common home", said Kozyrev. 
  Speaking of the Crimean situation, the minister noted that 
this region is not an international hotbed and the Russian 
leadership is working to prevent aggravation of the Crimean 
situation. The minister is sure that the people of the Crimea, 
a sovereign republic within Ukraine, the Ukrainian people and 
the people of Russia will solve all the problems calmly and 
peacefully in a democratic way. It is very important that 
extremists pushing the peoples towards fratricide do not involve 
in the situation. 
  As for the fate of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Kozyrev 
reminded deputies of negotiations Russia is holding with 
Ukraine. "They are very specific and detailed. A regular round 
of the negotiations has just finished and the impression is more 
inspiring than it was before. Certain quantitative parameters 
have been found, and the sides are closer to an understanding 
that Sevastopol should be the Russian naval base," said Kozyrev. 
  It seems that the negotiations will be completed or any 
final 
decisions will be taken after the Ukrainian elections. Russia, 
naturally, "will respect the choice of the Ukrainian people and 
keep business-like mutually beneficial and fraternal relations 
with any leadership to be elected," said Andrey Kozyrev.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- "The need for a peace-making 
operation in Abkhazia is evident, the war cannot be stopped 
without the introduction of peace-makers," First Deputy Head of 
the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Colonel-General Vitaliy 
Zhurbenko told a State Duma plenary here today. 
  The report was delivered by Zhurbenko instead of Russian 
Defence Minister General of the Army Pavel Grachev who was 
absent from the Duma plenary on health reasons. 
  The general expressed the wish that the peace-making 
operation to be held in Abkhazia involve not only Russia but 
also other Commonwealth states. He told the deputies that some 
3,000 Russian servicemen - two motorized infantry battalions, 
three air-borne battalions, engineering units and a helicopter 
squadron - will be sent to Abkhazia under the plan approved by 
the Russian president. 
  Asked about the Russian-U.S. drill at the Totsk grounds, the 
Orenburg region, Zhurbenko called for their holding bearing in 
mind the drill aims to train peace-making operations. In his 
words, a similar drill in the U.S. with Russian participation 
will cost Russia three or four times more.

  [Text] Russia's Deputy Defence Minister, Cl.-General 
Grigoriy Kondratyev, has said he hopes that on Tuesday the 
Federation Council will ratify the presidential decree on 
conducting a peace-keeping operation in the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict area. 
  According to him, if the upper chamber of Russia's 
parliament 
resolves this issue positively, military aircraft will start 
lifting Russian peace-keepers to the conflict area on Wednesday. 
  There are plans to despatch 5 Russian battalions to the 
conflict zone. The number of "blue helmets" is to total 25 to 
30 hundred men. 
  This week General Kondratyev visited Abkhazia and inspected 
the locality, where the disengagement of the conflicting sides 
is to take place along the River Inguri. "The military have 
already done all they could to ensure success for the proposed 
peace-keeping operation," he told Interfax on Saturday.

"Iraq Waits for Zero Hour"] 
  [Text] For the last six months Smolensk Square has been 
awash with rumors that Russia will support lifting the embargo 
against Iraq. Moscow is concerned for the fate of the $7.5 
billion which it has lost owing to the embargo. The United 
Nations decided to clarify just what the thinking is on this 
score in Moscow, and dispatched Rolf Ekeus, executive chairman 
of the special commission for the disarmament of Iraq, to us. 
  Addressing journalists at a briefing, Mr. Ekeus kept 
repeating phrases like "we have destroyed, closed, mothballed, 
and dismantled".... Unfortunately, the UN representative 
carefully side-stepped the problems of proffering aid to the 
impoverished civilian population of Iraq. 
  "The question of lifting the embargo on Iraq has been 
actively whipped up in Russia of late. Have you noticed changes 
in the Russian approach to this question?" -- We couldn't stop 
ourselves from asking this. 
  Obviously, the guys in the Kremlin and on Smolensk Square 
are 
in resolute mood, as, in his reply, Mr. Ekeus merely mentioned 
general humanitarian values, saying not a word about Russia's 
position. 
  The situation was clarified by a high-ranking staffer from 
the Foreign Ministry. He reported that, in contacts with the 
Iraqis, the Russian leadership is demanding a "softening" of 
their approach. Moreover, Russia intends to propose that the 
United Nations give Iraq a chance in the form of a six-month 
trial period. If in this time Baghdad "behaves in a civilized 
manner," then matters will move on to lifting the embargo. Nor 
can one forget about the ships containing equipment worth tens 
of millions of dollars from Russia, destined for Iraq, which, it 
emerges, have been moored in the harbors of Persian Gulf states 
for three years already, waiting for its hour to come. Judging 
by information from Mr. Ekeus and the Foreign Ministry, this 
hour may come as early as this year.

  [Text] Bonn June 17 TASS -- "The Russian-German military- 
technical cooperation should not lag behind the interstate 
relations," Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin told a news 
conference here today after meeting German Defence Minister 
Volker Ruehe. 
  "It was a saturated and constructive conversation to state 
we 
are almost ready to discuss the conclusion of a Russian-German 
intergovernmental agreement on termination of dangerous military 
activities whose draft has been prepared," said the speaker. 
  I have invited Volker Ruehe to visit a military settlement 
in 
my hometown of Volgograd together with Russian Defence Minister 
Pavel Grachev. The settlement is housing officers and soldiers 
of the 8th Guard Army, the former 62th Army of Marshal V. 
Chuikov. It is being built with participation of German firms. 
I am glad to say they are working well. The army was not 
withdrawn without proper accommodation. It is a good example of 
Russian-German fruitful cooperation." 
  In his turn, the German defence minister told the news 
conference he has accepted the invitation to visit Volgograd 
with pleasure. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about his attitude to the upcoming 
Russian 
signing of the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels on 
Wednesday, the minister said he is very glad this will be done. 
  Describing the NATO-Russian relations, he said that European 
stability cannot be achieved without Russia. This country 
cannot be treated as Albania or Tajikistan, he said. The 
minister noted the upcoming Russian-German naval exercises in 
the Baltic Sea and other exercises scheduled for future. He 
said none would believe this is possible two years ago. 
  On the same day the State Duma delegation met Bundesrat head 
Klaus Wedemeier and State Minister in the German Foreign 
Ministry Helmut Schaefer.

  [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- Today, on the last day of an 
official visit to Germany, a State Duma delegation, led by its 
Chairman Ivan Rybkin, laid a wreath at the memorial to Russian 
liberator soldiers in the Treptow Park, Berlin. 
  After two days of meetings and talks with leaders and 
prominent politicians in Bonn, Russian legislators arrived in 
the German capital on Saturday, where they familiarised 
themselves with the experience of privatization of state 
enterprises in the eastern part of the country, as well as the 
examples of the participation of foreign business people in that 
process. During their visit to the Kvo Kabel plant, which now 
fully belongs to a British firm and supplies half of its output 
to Russia, as well as during their conversation with Berlin 
Burgomaster Eberhard Dipgen members of the delegation got very 
interesting and useful information, Rybkin told ITAR-TASS. 
"There should be 101 ways of privatization of state-owned 
enterprises instead of just one," Rybkin pointed out. He said 
that at present there are some 1,500 industrial enterprises in 
Russia which may go bankrupt. In the opinion of Rybkin, their 
situation calls for a comprehensive approach. 
  The Russian delegation will have a meeting today with heads 
of the Berlin chamber of deputies in the Palace of 
Charlottenburg. The guests will also visit the Reichstag 
building. In the afternoon of the last day of the visit they 
will have meetings with the command of the Western Army group 
and the personnel of the Berlin Brigade.

  [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- A delegation of the Russian 
State Duma led by the Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin ended its visit 
to Germany on Sunday. 
  During the four-day visit Rybkin met with the German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and German President Richard von 
Weizacker, Bundestag Chairman Rita Suessmuth, government 
officials, leaders of parliamentary factions and different 
political parties. 
  Russian parliamentarians reached an agreement with their 
German colleagues to develop close cooperation, primarily at the 
level of the Duma committees and commissions of the German 
Bundestag dealing with economic issues. 
  On the final day of the visit Russian lawmakers visited 
Russian servicemen from the Berlin Brigade of Western Troops. 
Addressing soldiers and officers of the Russian military 
contingent who will be the last to abandon the German territory 
in August, 1994, Rybkin declared that "their motherland would 
welcome them with a generous heart." Rybkin pointed out that 
looking into the state budget, lawmakers found "inner reserves" 
for the Army's needs worth 3.5 trillion roubles. Apart from 
that, funds are expected to be raised during the second stage of 
privatisation beginning in July, which, according to experts' 
estimates, will amount to 15-20 trillion roubles. The State 
Duma has decided to use these funds, in particular, for the 
construction of housing for servicemen and conversion projects, 
Rybkin said. 
  Late on Sunday the delegation of the Russian parliament left 
Berlin for Moscow.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast; passages within quotation marks </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent M. Lillevyali] The State Duma is in 
its own way a microcosm of our society and we went there today 
to put a question to some of the elected representatives: How 
do you feel about the president's edict on new means for 
fighting crime? 
  [Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Communist Party of Russia] "I 
take a dual position here. On the one hand, I would support any 
measures aimed at stopping gangsterism. But on the other hand, 
they must be within the law." 
  [Yekaterina Lakhova, leader of Women of Russia faction] "The 
president's edict cannot exceed the Constitution and cannot 
exceed federal law. All those who drafted the edict, and I 
understand that it was the president who drafted the edict, the 
people who drafted the edict, drafted a completely 
unconstitutional edict. I am very concerned by some of the 
individual formulations -- the legislative committee discussed 
them yesterday -- that tally directly with 1937 formulations." 
  [Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Liberal Democratic Party 
of 
Russia] "They should have added our program. An emergency 
should be introduced in certain regions of the country. In 
certain cases, we should resort to the court martial system and 
throw the Armed Forces into the fight against crime. The 
militia cannot cope. It needs to be given the right to hold 
additional weapons. The right of the citizen to bear arms 
should be defended. That is the only way. It would be 
temporary. The country's leadership introduced such an edict in 
1947. It was very effective." 
  [Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of Yabloko faction] 
"Introducing 
the atmosphere of a free-for-all and giving some people the 
chance to break all sorts of laws in order to tackle other 
criminals will not in any way solve things." 
  [Lillevyali] We would like to finish with the point of view 
of a professional lawyer -- the chairman of the State Duma 
Security Committee, Viktor Ilyukhin. 
  [Ilyukhin] "It is first unconstitutional and contradicts the 
Constitution. Second, it torpedoes the complete judicial system 
now in existence. As a lawyer, I have every reason to question 
the ability of judicial bodies, which have always been guided 
only by the Constitution and only by the law, to implement it. 
What will the reaction of the court be when a sentence is 
passed on the basis of the edict and not the law?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F>
Federation Federal Assembly State Duma, by Vil Dorofeyev 
(POSTFACTUM -- specially for TRUD): "The `Point Of No Return' 
Has Been Reached"] 
  [Text] [Dorofeyev] It is said, Ivan Petrovich, that when 
you were in the old lower chamber building you ordered portraits 
of four chairmen of the Russian Empire State Duma to be hung in 
your office. What was it, a tribute to those who founded 
Russian parliamentarism at the beginning of the century? Or a 
reminder to yourself that the country now has the chance to 
storm the heights of parliamentary democracy "at the fifth 
attempt"?... 
  [Rybkin] There is much argument today about parliamentarism 
-- what form it should take. Yet the foundations of 
parliamentarism existed in Russia much earlier than in many 
Western countries. There was Novgorod the Great, with its veche 
[general meeting of the townspeople]. There was the Assembly of 
the Land, where representatives of all estates of trouble-torn 
Rus elected the 16-year-old Mikhail Romanov czar. (Why the 
original organs of representative authority in Russia were 
subsequently transformed is another matter.) Finally, at the 
beginning of our era, a rather unwilling emperor was forced to 
build the institution of the Duma into the state mechanism. 
  The empire's first State Duma lasted for two months and 10 
days. The second lasted three months and 10 days. Ours -- the 
Russian Federation State Duma -- started work 11 January. So we 
have outlived the two first Russian parliaments. Although you 
know yourself what a wide spectrum of views is represented in 
the first State Duma in the history of the Russian Federation: 
eight factions with variously opposing views. The election of 
the Duma chairman was a typical example. I was elected to the 
post by a majority of only one vote. In the days of the Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet this fact would no doubt have sparked 
off a long debate. But the majority of deputies in the present 
State Duma decided not to focus attention on this, but to seek 
consensus. 
  [Dorofeyev] I remember as soon as the election results were 
known political scientists were predicting a prolonged 
argy-bargy among the factions in the State Duma. But this 
apparently did not occur.... 
  [Rybkin] Of course, there was a reluctance to repeat the 
fate of the Khasbulatov Supreme Soviet. But the main reason why 
the State Duma rapidly established itself lies elsewhere, in my 
view. In the first place, most of the people elected to it, 
despite all the flaws in the embryonic multiparty system, are 
sincere and passionate about the country's future. Second, the 
professional standard of most of the deputies is high. Many 
have experience of practical work in senior posts in the regions 
and in central departments in postcommunist Russia. Finally, a 
part was played by the recognition by the majority of deputies 
of an apparently simple truth: The country is tired of 
confrontation between the authorities, of the constant talk. 
  Look what an interesting situation has developed. 
International affairs committees were the most "popular" among 
deputies in all supreme soviets. But the most authoritative 
committee in the present State Duma is the Committee on the 
Budget, Finance, Banking, and Taxes, headed by M. Zadornov, from 
the "Yabloko" bloc. Well, in all civilized countries it is the 
budget that is the focus of parliamentarians' attention, the 
foundation of their activities. 
  The second example is the Committee on the Economy, headed 
by Sergey Glazyev. It, in conjunction with government experts, 
has the job of devising a program to extricate the country from 
the crisis.... 
  [Dorofeyev] But society is up to here with anticrisis 
programs, just as it is with advertisements for Snickers. 
Academician Abalkin's program, the "500 Days" program, Gaydar's 
monetarist program. They were all adopted as a "basis" for 
work, but for political reasons they resembled a very powerful 
truck with an empty tank. No legislative base was created for 
any of the programs. 
  [Rybkin] That is why the State Duma's priority program today 
is the urgent elaboration of a large package of laws. I would 
divide them into two groups. The first is based on the Civil 
and Land Codes. It is essentially with their help that the law 
will consolidate the radical changes currently taking place in 
our country with regard to property. 
  The second group of laws bears directly on the economy. But 
here the task is more complex. Because, in my view, this group 
of laws should not merely reinforce the current progress of 
economic reform, albeit slow -- but work to accelerate it. This 
will take more time and closer collaboration with the 
presidential and government structures. Not confrontation, as 
in the recent past, but very close collaboration. 
  I foresee a question concerning the events of last October 
in 
Moscow and my attitude toward them, since I was a member of the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and was in the "White House" 
during what were tragic days for Russia. Seven months on, now 
that emotions have abated, giving way to a ruthless analysis of 
the situation and of oneself, I believe that what happened in 
Moscow on 3-4 October was a general defeat for the authorities, 
both executive and representative. So I take a dim view of 
those who have not calmed down, who are trying to exploit human 
tragedies, crisis phenomena in the economy, the inability of the 
authorities.... 
  I want to stress once again that the president and 
government 
are pretty happy at the moment with the State Duma's work on the 
blocks of laws. And the first part of Petr Stolypin's 
celebrated utterance, addressed, incidentally, to the deputies 
of the second State Duma: "You need great upheavals..." I 
believe is now part of the past, God willing, as far as Russian 
reality is concerned. 
  [Dorofeyev] And the second part: "...We need a Great 
Russia"? How realistic is it in the foreseeable future? 
  [Rybkin] Stolypin's words about Great Russia came back to me 
on several occasions during the State Duma delegation's visit to 
the United States. Particularly after a frank discussion with 
Vice President A. Gore. He told me: "I am surprised when I 
hear people in your country say that America is preventing 
Russia from advancing along the path to a democratic society, to 
economic reform. On the contrary, we want Russia to become a 
rich and, most of all, stable country. To be frank, most of 
your people are better educated than Americans. There is no 
need to mention the raw material potential. It is just that you 
need to understand yourselves first and foremost. Your people 
have talent".... 
  [Dorofeyev] But what Mr. Gore says is an outsider's view. 
What about the people living in Russia and trying to overcome 
the problems of the transitional period. For example, those 
"nonpayments"? 
  [Rybkin] In my view, this is one of the most disgraceful 
phenomena of the economic reform. Recently I put it to Yegor 
Timurovich Gaydar: If he had gone to the market in Moscow with 
a sack and filled it with goods from the stalls, without paying, 
what would people have thought of his behavior? Not paying the 
farmers for delivering the harvest from July through the 
December snows is a comparable phenomenon. I agree there should 
be market arrangements, but all those involved in the market, 
whoever they are, must be paid in accordance with their labor. 
This is the foundation of all the reforms. Therefore one of 
the State Duma's first steps was a decree on ensuring the 
functioning of the agro-industrial complex in 1994. We will 
seek to ensure its implementation at all costs, including a 
separate entry in the budget. 
  [Dorofeyev] But doesn't this decree smack of outright 
lobbying, since the chairman himself was a prominent member of 
the agrarian faction before being elected to this high office? 
Indeed, your entire life has been connected with the 
countryside: Volgograd Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, 
mechanical engineer on a major kolkhoz in the oblast, then 
postgraduate work at the institute and teaching work.... 
  [Rybkin] I have also reflected on the fact that an 
institution of authority like the State Duma is headed by an 
agrarian. Perhaps in what is a crucial period for the country, 
it should finally address the farmer in a real, statesmanlike 
way. After all, it is my firm belief that Russia is a 
self-sufficient country. You say "lobbying." But before the 
Duma adopted this decree I visited Yaroslavl, Tambov, and 
Voronezh Oblasts. The land is different in these regions, but 
the situation in the countryside is similar. Only recently many 
politicians were pinning great hopes on private farming. Let us 
give peasants land, they would say, and we will solve the 
country's most nagging problem -- the food problem -- at a 
stroke. Some 280,000 private farms were set up in Russia. Some 
10 million hectares of land were distributed. But the return 
from private farming in terms of the aggregate social product is 
1 percent so far. I would not want to blame anyone. There was 
no systematic, deliberate support for this on the part of the 
state. Why did it happen? I have repeatedly tried to give an 
answer to people in the government, citing the experience of the 
developed countries. There, whatever they were developing, 
whether it be "socialism with a human face" or "people's 
capitalism," state support for the agrarian sector was assured. 
Look at the experience of the 26 most developed countries of 
Europe. There the cost component of state support for 
agricultural production is up to 40 percent. In Japan it is up 
to 80 percent,. Why do the capitalist countries, where they 
know how to husband resources, do this? Well because they 
realize there is nothing worse than strategic food dependence. 
I profoundly believe this is something we must learn from them, 
and learn well. 
  [Dorofeyev] But the state simply does not have the 
substantial funds to provide specific support for the 
countryside in order to avoid strategic food dependence in the 
immediate future, as the "budget furor" in the State Duma 
demonstrated. The treasury is in debt.... 
  [Rybkin] First, the Duma "budget furor." Essentially the 
country has been living without a budget for three years. No 
budget has been presented to parliament, foreign economic 
activity has not been dealt with at all, and hard currency has 
not featured. For the first time, on 23 March, the Duma 
insisted that it be informed of all the budget items for this 
year. The budget was adopted on first reading on the old 
legislative basis, on the basis of the old tax normatives. But 
what concerns me more is the 1995 budget. By law it has to be 
submitted to the lower chamber eight months before the start of 
the fiscal year. Since the Russian economy is going through a 
transitional period, we are insisting that the government submit 
the draft budget for next year to us in September. This is 
essential: Through the budget we will get a sense of the 
government's economic program, if there is one. It is my 
profound belief that we will not get anywhere without making the 
economy controllable again. 
  Now we come to debts and loans. We owe $90 billion. We are 
owed $160 billion. A number of countries is prepared to repay 
debts to us, large ones at that. One $1-2 billion, another $3 
billion, a third $1.5 billion. They must be grabbed as quickly 
as possible. And the debts that will not be repaid, sell them 
on. At 0.6 to 0.8 of the face value. Let people collect them 
if they can. I can foresee your objections -- but what about 
political aims.... But politics is politics and economics is 
economics. If it is "inconvenient" for the state to press 
debtors, then let our private entrepreneurs deal with the 
problem. In two words -- no charity. This applies also to 
technical credits to CIS countries. It is time they and we 
started to live within our means. I totally agree here with the 
Germans: "Good accounting does not spoil friendships." 
  [Dorofeyev] At the meetings in Volgograd you were repeatedly 
asked, and in a rather peremptory manner: "What are we 
building, then?" and "Where are we going?" You are a member of 
the Russian Federation Communist Party, elected to the State 
Duma to represent the Agrarian Party, ideologically the closest, 
some of my colleagues believe, to the Russian Federation 
Communist Party. At the same time, your career and your 
position in the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, and 
indeed your present position, indicate certain beliefs that are 
different from those derived from [Stalin's] "Short Course of 
the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)." 
  [Rybkin] Well, you were probably in the CPSU, like many 
current radical democrats, but you did not live in accordance 
with the "Short Course." All of us who are nearly 50 or more 
are children of the same era. A contradictory era, stained with 
blood, it is true, unfortunately. But I would not renounce what 
I have lived through as easily as many tried to do in the 
romantic fervor of perestroyka. Incidentally, neither would I 
blame Mikhail Gorbachev alone for all our ills. He did a great 
deal for Russia. He essentially gave impetus to the reforms. 
And I do not intend to renounce the military endeavors of my 
father and the old men of my village. The paths they trod, the 
enthusiasm with which they led their lives -- a difficult life, 
without rights, but an honest life -- are part of my life as 
well. 
  I regard the decade from 1975 through 1985 as a lost decade 
for the country. But that is the past. And we must think about 
the future. What kind of national consciousness will eventually 
emerge from the remnants of the current morbid, wounded imperial 
arrogance? No state can exist without this consciousness. It 
is arguable what is harder: To reform the economy or to form a 
national consciousness. 
  As for the answer to the question: "What are we building?" 
-- in this case I would prefer the Swedish model of socialism. 
But the "infantile disorder of leftism" will continue to be 
part and parcel of our mass consciousness for a very long time 
to come, no matter what political movement a Russian citizen 
relates to. 
  Airmen have a very precise term: "the point of no return." 
When an aircraft has already expended a large part of its fuel 
it cannot return to the airfield where it took off, so all it 
can do is continue on its way. In my view, Russia has now 
passed the "point of no return" with regard to its 70-year 
totalitarian past. At a cost and with losses, but it is now 
past. There is only one way to go now -- into a civilized 
future worthy of its people.

  [Text] Berlin June 18 TASS -- "There should be one and not 
101 variants of privatization of former state enterprises," 
believes Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin currently here as part of his 
official visit to Germany. 
  The Duma delegation has visited the Berlin Kvo cable plant 
that belongs to British investors and supplies half of its 
products to Russia. The guests were especially interested in 
the plant's transition to the market. The plant heads said that 
the main thing is to adopt marketing as a new production 
philosophy. 
  Rybkin told ITAR-TASS that the visit to the plant and a 
meeting with Berlin Burgomaster Eberhard Diepgen informed the 
deputies about privatization aspects. The deputies will take 
this information into account. 
  "Russia has some 1,500 plants which may become bankrupt. We 
need a comprehensive approach to this problem and I agree with 
the stand of Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov and experienced 
businessmen," said Rybkin. 
  The Duma speaker laid a wreath to the memorial on Unter Der 
Linden and the monument to Soviet soldiers in the Berlin borough 
of Tiergarten.

<F P=106> [Manfred Quiring report from Moscow: "No Suitable Successor </F>
for Yeltsin"] 
  [Excerpts] In the opinion of Ivan Rybkin, president of the 
Russian State Duma, social explosions in Russia are very 
unlikely, despite predictions to the contrary. Before 
yesterday's anniversary of Russia's sovereignty declaration of 
12 June 1991, the Moscow politician said yesterday in an 
interview with BERLINER ZEITUNG that he currently does not see 
an alternative to President Yeltsin. [passage omitted] 
  He affirmed that in the Russian Duma there is a far-reaching 
consensus on the development of all forms of ownership -- both 
state and private ones. "All parliamentary groups, also the 
communists, advocated this." There are only differences on the 
share of the state property in the economy -- at present, it is 
still two-thirds. 
  Duma President Rybkin regularly meets with President 
Yeltsin. 
He had just visited him in the Kremlin, in order to discuss 
important domestic and foreign policy questions, he reported 
rather casually. "My relations with President Yeltsin -- on a 
factual level -- are the very best, they are constructive." The 
relations between the parliament and the president -- marked by 
confrontation in the time of the old Supreme Soviet -- have also 
changed. Rybkin is convinced that a vast majority in the 
parliament and the state structures proceeds on the assumption 
that President Yeltsin will exercise his full powers until June 
1996, which is, according to the Constitution, the scheduled 
date of new elections. 
  Talks on candidates at a time when the present president 
will 
be in office for another two years are simply not correct. 
Moreover, he does not see a suitable candidate anywhere. "I 
know those who want to become president very well and I can tell 
you: With the limited experience that they have, the 
presidential responsibility will simply collapse on the day 
after the election and nothing will be left." In order to 
anticipate the consequences of decisions made in Moscow for the 
most distant parts of the country, great experiences of life and 
leadership are required. All the differences that exist in 
Russia have to be unified, he said. 
  He admitted that the previous economic policy has resulted 
in 
an extreme differentiation of the living conditions in Russia. 
The rich earn 45 times more than the poor. However, the Duma 
president claimed that, during his numerous trips through the 
country, he ascertained that "the reserves of endurance are 
sufficiently large." The people keep above water with second 
and third jobs, he said. 
  Meanwhile, the majority in the country has realized that 
"the 
time of speedy solutions" is over. He is convinced that "the 
people have understood that daily work is in demand now." The 
president's latest edicts and the Duma's work is now aimed at a 
revival of production, on the one hand, and at letting 
ineffective enterprises go bankrupt, on the other, he said.

Authorities at the Expense of Subsidies"] 
  [Text] The Communist Party faction in the State Duma 
yesterday tried to wreck the work of the lower chamber by 
declining to vote on the agenda. The cause for this political 
demarche was the refusal by the Pressa publishers to print 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, whose chief editor Valeriy Chikin is himself 
a deputy. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY found out, yesterday's issue of 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA did not see the light for economic, not 
political, reasons. Pressa Deputy Director Mikhail Trushin said 
that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA had loaned newsprint from the publishing 
house and now owes it for 345 tonnes. Furthermore, the paper is 
not paying for printing services: Since the beginning of the 
year its debt has approximated 84 million rubles. SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA does not disclaim its debts and therefore, according to 
editor Vladimir Polyakov, is trying to obtain subsidies through 
the State Duma in order to continue the paper's publication.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Chugayev: "Communists' Faction Announces </F>
Strike"] 
  [Text] The practice of boycotting State Duma sessions 
seems to be becoming traditional for legislators. Following the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the "12 December" 
group, at the 17 June plenary session the Communists' faction 
resorted to this form of protest. 
  The faction's spokesman, G. Selezneyev, said at the start of 
the session that the reason for the action was the "Pressa" 
publishing house's decision to halt the publication of 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA 16 June because of nonpayments. In the 
deputy's opinion, the newspaper's debts arose with its temporary 
closure after the events last October. 
  The representatives of the Communists' faction demanded that 
members of the government be called to the session to give the 
relevant explanations. As a result it was decided to instruct 
Duma Deputy Speaker G. Chilingarov to investigate the matter. 
  The boycott by the Communists' faction and also the 
generally 
small number of deputies present at the session led to the point 
where it proved very difficult to make any decisions. 
  In particular the Duma refused to include on the agenda the 
question of acting General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko's appeal on 
the deprivation of V. Zhirinovskiy's rights as a deputy. In the 
deputies' opinion, the acting prosecutor, in accordance with the 
Constitution, does not have the right to send such documents to 
the Duma. Only the general prosecutor has this right. The day 
before the Duma council adopted the decision to send a 
representation to the mandate commission for study. But some 
deputies, representing mainly the "Russian path" group, saw in 
this an element of compromise and attacked the Duma council, 
demanding a vote of no confidence. 
  The proposal from Deputy Loginov to examine the question of 
protecting MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI correspondent Zhilin who, the 
deputy says, has been threatened with reprisal since the 
publication of his article "Generals' Business" on abuses in the 
Western Group of Forces did not get through either. On the 
other hand, the deputies decided to examine once again how their 
decisions on the creation of a parliamentary television and 
radio company are being fulfilled. 
  The rejected motions also included the idea, put forward by 
LDPR faction speaker V. Marychev, of sending an urgent telegram 
to summon I. Rybkin, who is on an official visit in Germany, to 
the session. Yet in the absence of the speaker on 17 June the 
Duma set a kind of record. Debates around the agenda, which did 
not lead to any serious changes to it, lasted exactly one hour 
40 minutes.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- A total of 145 amendments to 
the law against corruption have been discussed today by the 
State Duma deputies. 
  The second reading of the law has brought no results, as the 
deputies failed to agree on categories of responsibility of 
officials. In the opinion of Deputy Artem Tarasov, "One cannot 
compare the responsibility of the Central Bank head and the 
minister of education". He also thinks that the prime minister 
should not resign without giving an account of his work. 
Tarasov gained no support of deputies. 
  The deputies want to prohibit high-ranking officials to 
deliver lectures for payment. They also want state secret 
information submitted to the tax inspection to remain 
undisclosed. Some suggested to demand that all officials 
produce their income declarations. 
  After a break the deputies will continue to discuss the 
draft 
law against corruption.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Lawmaking" rubric: </F>
"Combat Against Corruption To Continue 22 June. Law Has Not 
Been Passed"] 
  [Text] The State Duma's second reading of the draft law on 
combating corruption opened with a report by Security Committee 
Chairman Viktor Ilyukhin. He reported that the committee 
examined 145 amendments and that the final text of the document 
had been toned down. 
  The approach to bribe-takers has been made differentiated: 
An official holding an especially senior position shall be 
liable for any bribe, an average-ranking official shall be 
liable beginning with a major bribe, while a non-official person 
(director of a commercial store) shall be liable for a 
considerable bribe. One may suppose that a rank-and-file 
non-official (a cleaning woman, for example) shall be liable 
only for receiving a bribe on an especially big scale. 
  Earlier, the deputies could not receive money for creative 
or 
teaching work; now they can. Because the country's system of 
payment is poorly developed, the ban on paying for big 
transactions through the bank or by credit cards has been 
lifted. Finally, only officials shall be obliged to declare 
their incomes. 
  In additions to those amendments that the Security Committee 
has approved, it has begun discussing those to which it 
objected. Deputy Pokhmelkin of the "Russia's Choice," for 
example, proposed several amendments aimed at excluding from 
among those designated as "officials" those unrelated to public 
service, that is to say, at excluding one of the main goals of 
the draft law (government control over private businesses). 
Deputy Tarasov suggested that categories of liability should be 
strictly defined so that the head of a commercial organization 
would be liable under the proposed law only to the extent of the 
powers delegated to him by the authorities. Even Deputy Baburin 
agreed with the opinion of his fellow deputies, noting that one 
cannot infinitely expand the notion of corruption. 
  To the joy of Mr. Ilyukhin, not a single amendment proposed 
from the various flanks of the political spectrum was approved. 
The discussion itself was extremely incomprehensive, 
disorderly, and wild because of both the deputies' extreme, 
disparate postures, and because Valentin Kovalev, a less 
experienced deputy speaker, was sitting in for Speaker Ivan 
Rybkin. As a result, Mr. Baburin's call -- "the best answer by 
the Duma to the Edict on Combating Banditry is a law on 
combating corruption" -- so far remains unheeded by his fellow 
deputies, and the discussion will continue on 22 June.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- An attack on Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin has not been supported by the majority 
of deputies in the State Duma. Independent Deputy Nadezhda 
Verveyko of the Krasnodar territory suggested at a plenary 
meeting of the Duma on Friday that an item on the Russian 
president's oath be put on the agenda of the session. She 
asserted that for several months now the Russian president has 
been working without being sworn in. A minority of deputies of 
the State Duma voted for her proposal. 
  Deputy from Russia's Choice group Anatoliy Yushchenko who 
spoke in the debate pointed out that Nadezhda Verveyko, a 
trained jurist, should know that under articles of the new 
Russian Constitution for the transitional period the president 
need not be sworn in a second time. Nevertheless Verveyko has 
insisted on the voting. 
  It is surprising that despite the clarity of the matter she 
was still supported by 178 votes.

  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- The Council of the Russian 
parliament lower house relegated a representation by Russian 
Prosecutor-General Vladimir Ilyushenko on divesting Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, of 
a legislator's immunity to the house's credentials commission 
for examination, Valentin Kovalev who chaired the chamber's 
plenary meeting on Friday, said here. 
  It will be remembered that the acting prosecutor-general 
claims in his representation that Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last 
Leap to the South" is liable to criminal prosecution. 
  The report by Kovalev provoked a lively response from 
legislators. For instance, Deputy Andrey Dorovskiy from the 
LDPR group insisted that lawmakers should vote to return the 
representation by Ilyushenko who, in the deputy's opinion, had 
no powers to sign such a document, since he "was not approved as 
prosecutor-general". 
  Another proposal -- to put the item on the representation on 
the session's agenda -- did not pass either: The motion was 
short of 20 votes.

  [Text] Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sharply criticized the decision of 
the State Duma to transfer to the mandate commission the appeal 
of acting Prosecutor General Aleksey Ilyushenko asking for the 
consent of the Duma for bringing Zhirinovskiy to justice on 
warmongering and inciting ethnic hatred charges. 
  Zhirinovskiy stated that Ilyushenko himself was "nobody and 
is sitting in his office only because the president wants it." 
  Ilyushenko motivated his appeal by the results of the 
preliminary investigations due to the publication of 
Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last Push for the South." Ilyushenko 
referred to provisions in the Criminal Code against warmongering 
and inciting ethnic hatred.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "CIS" rubric: </F>
"Russian Mass Media Favor Wrong Men. Konstantin Zatulin 
Becomes Still Dearer to Sergey Shakhray"] 
  [Text] A press conference by Konstantin Zatulin, Duma CIS 
Affairs Committee chairman, was devoted to presidential 
elections in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus]. The last week 
before them, the Duma man thought, will be decisive. In both 
sovereign republics there are two main candidates for the lofty 
position: Mr. Kravchuk and Mr. Kuchma in Ukraine, and Mr. 
Kebich and Mr. Lukashenko in Belorussia. Mr. Zatulin pointed 
out the high probability that a second round of voting in both 
countries may be required to determine the winners, whereas just 
recently no one doubted the victory of Mr. Kuchma and Mr. Kebich. 
  From then on, however, the committee head remarked, it is 
the 
Russian mass media that played a negative role. For example, 
the media resolutely sided with Leonid Kravchuk although, Mr. 
Zatulin thought, "Ukraine's policy under this president has been 
marked by craftiness and a lack of sincerity, and by the desire 
to oppose Russia in things big and small, from the United 
Nations, to NATO, to the CIS. Leonid Kuchma's program calling 
for closer and friendlier links between an independent Ukraine 
and Russia is liked much more by the Duma man. The latest 
"pro-Kravchuk" publications in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and especially television's Channel One's 
taking a program about Mr. Kuchma off the air, appear more than 
strange to him. 
  Also obvious is Mr. Zatulin's Belorussian affection -- 
Vyacheslaw Kebich. Albeit he cannot understand a few things 
there: Why should the Duma, on a cue from the Agrarian faction, 
give the floor to the chief opponent of today's Belorussian 
premier, that "local version of Gdlyan." The CIS Committee head 
likened Aleksandr Lukashenko's report with the report of his 
fellow committee chairman, Mr. Ilyukhin, head of the Security 
Committee, during the reading of the Law on Combating 
Corruption, referring to both as "a method of squaring accounts 
with entrepreneurship." Mr. Lukashenko's victory would mean 
compromising the idea of mending fences between Belorussia and 
Russia, concluded Mr. Zatulin. He also pointed to the danger of 
a polarization of the heretofore calm Belorussian society once 
supporters of recent speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich and of 
People's Front leader Zenon Poznyak unite on one flank. 
  In winding up, Konstantin Zatulin explained his quitting as 
executive secretary of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord 
faction in the State Duma by his being too busy in the CIS 
Committee, in the party, etc. He specially stressed the absence 
of differences with Sergey Shakhray, and even pointed out the 
now established harmony because resignations are something the 
Party of Russian Unity and Accord has come to live with.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Parliamentary Observer Vladimir Yermolin </F>
under the general heading "When Adopting the Federal Budget the 
State Duma Accepted Reduced Defense Spending" accompanied by 
list of deputies who voted for, against, or abstained and those 
who did not register a vote] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Parliamentary Observer Commentary </H5>
  It should be borne in mind that by voting for the adoption 
of 
the government version of the federal budget, the deputies were 
thereby accepting the defense budget which, when the proposals 
of Mikhail Zadornov and his committee [the Committee for the 
Budget, Taxes, Banks, and Finances] were taken into account, 
amounted in total to 40.6 trillion rubles [R]. This figure, 
according to the most modest estimates of specialists from the 
Defense Ministry (and indeed the ministries of finance and the 
economy, too), will not meet even the minimum level required. 
That will require around 15 trillion more. 
  Thus, in saying "yes" to such a budget it may be presumed 
that the deputies were leaving the Army to sort out its own 
problems, saying to it: "you'll manage somehow." It is curious 
that even those deputies who just the day before considered it 
almost a crime to agree to military spending of less than R55 
trillion somehow suddenly decided to make do with scarcely more 
than R40 trillion. Look at the results of the voting and 
remember the deputies' public statements... The figures speak 
for themselves -- only 40 parliamentarians felt it necessary to 
say "no" to this budget. Of course, not all of them are 
concerned for the fate of the Armed Forces -- the present budget 
will also reduce science, culture, and health care to starvation 
rations. But those who said "yes" to the government draft law 
did agree to a defense budget of R40.6 trillion. And that means 
that they agreed to a level of officers' pay which is a pittance 
by present-day standards, to a chronic shortage of housing in 
the Army, to ships which will have to perform combat duty even 
though they can barely stay afloat because there is no money to 
pay for repairs, to aircraft which have been standing idle for 
months for want of fuel, to test ranges overgrown with weeds, to 
a defense industry which is paralyzed... There are many things 
that those deputies agreed to when they voted so hastily for the 
government version of the budget. 
  An analysis of the results of the vote clearly show that the 
following factions did not consider it necessary to fight for a 
decent defense budget: the Communists, the Agrarians, the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, Women of Russia, the 
majority of deputies from New Regional Policy, the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord, and the Democratic Party of Russia. A 
section of Russia's Choice preferred to abstain while another 
section did not vote at all. Only the Yabloko 
(Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin) faction actively opposed the 
government's draft budget. And even that faction objected not 
so much to the reduced military spending as to the general 
approach to budget policy itself. 
  Strange as it may seem, the members of the State Duma's 
Defense Committee also accepted the loss of R15 trillion. None 
of them voted "against." To be fair it should be noted that 
until recently the committee sought to influence the 
government's position and acted as an ally of the Defense 
Ministry. Thus it is all the more incomprehensible why members 
of the committee surrendered their right to vote without a 
battle, as it were. How else is one to interpret the failure to 
take part in the voting? Eight committee members actually said 
"yes" to the budget. Although at the moment that the vote took 
place, Aleksandr Piskunov, for example, was actually standing at 
the microphone making one last desperate attempt to persuade his 
colleagues not to rush into the adoption of the budget. 
Incidentally, Sergey Glazyev, who recently told KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
readers (see the 7 June issue) how it was possible to get 55 
trillion for the Army without increasing the budget deficit at 
the same time, decided for some reason against making such an 
attempt. 
  To cut a long story short, there is one conclusion which 
instantly springs to mind: The rumors about a 
military-industrial lobby in the State Duma proved to be 
exaggerated, to put it mildly. There is no reasonably cohesive 
force, faction, or party in the State Duma today which would 
seriously defend the military's interests. Barely more than a 
dozen [yedva li bolshe desytaka] members of the entire corps of 
deputies sincerely care for the Army and the country's defense. 
  I do not want to resort to conjecture or cast a slur on 
people whose absence from the session or failure to vote may 
well have been due to factors which are even quite valid. The 
results of the voting are in front of us. One vote out of many. 
No more than that. True, these results may affect the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of people and indeed the fate of the 
Russian Army itself. I hope that the deputies were aware of 
this when they decided which button to press or whether to press 
a button at all. The results of the voting which took place at 
1647 hours on 8 June may prove historic. And when in the future 
we look at the names of the people's elected representatives, we 
will have a special feeling when we think of the first State 
Duma in post-Soviet Russia and its attitude to the defense 
capability of the Armed Forces, the problems of the Army and 
Navy, and its concern for the "man with the gun." 
<H5>  The Roll-Call Vote Shows Who is Who </H5>
  The discussion of the 1994 federal budget at the second 
reading took place behind closed doors, as is well known. And 
the decision was also made "in-house" -- in the absence of the 
press and television. However, among the people there was, for 
quite understandable reasons, considerable interest in this 
vote. Within the Armed Forces, too, the logical question was 
asked: Which of the people's elected representatives said "yes" 
to such an patently meager defense budget? 
  In response to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA readers' requests, we now 
publish the results of the roll-call vote on the 1994 federal 
budget (second reading).

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Ishchenko: "Uranium Transported in a </F>
Passenger Railcar and Stored in a Cool Place -- Details About 
the Exposed Affair of the Misappropriation of Uranium-235"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg-Moscow -- It was at the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service St. Petersburg Directorate that the 
details of the abortive sale of 3 kg of highly enriched 
Uranium-235 stolen from a plant near Moscow (see NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA for 9 June) were conveyed to our 
correspondent. 
  It is probably a good thing that Lenya Golubkov had the idea 
of making money on shares from the MMM Joint Stock Company. 
Otherwise, this extraordinarily henpecked proletarian, in his 
search for money to buy boots for his wife and other joys of 
family life, might also have been drawn into a venture somewhat 
more hazardous to those around him than trading in wallpaper. 
The newspapers nowadays are simply bursting with articles 
explaining, in the greatest of detail and from the lips of 
prosperous people, how best to deceive the state (to obtain fake 
licenses, to evade customs duties, or to avoid tax inspections), 
and how to pocket a fair sum of money from doing so. 
  So it is, for instance, that one particular butcher, living 
until recently in the city of Pushkin in Leningrad Oblast, after 
closely studying the headlines in the central press, decided 
that there was no better way to improve his lot than through 
uranium. It has to be said that, to an experienced businessman, 
the transaction would not have appeared particularly complex -- 
to judge from the newspapers, it is possible to sell uranium on 
virtually any street, while actually getting hold of it is even 
simpler. Not for nothing has that distant relative been working 
for so many years at that Ministry of Atomic Energy closed 
enterprise near Moscow (in the interests of the investigation, 
we were asked to name neither the city nor the surnames), and he 
is all but treading this actual uranium underfoot.... 
  The month was February. The Moscow region was covered with 
snow. Security, it seemed, had also gone into hibernation for 
the winter (given, of course, that we proceed on the assumption 
that in summertime the vigilance of the courageous armed guards 
actually increases). It was on one such frosty evening that the 
Moscow relative, without any spying aids (such as a suitcase 
with a false bottom, a secret pocket in his clothing, or, if the 
worst should come to the worst, simply a pocket) calmly marched 
through the entrance to his beloved enterprise, calmly giving a 
little wave with a bulging mitten (it was there that, a few 
minutes earlier, he had poured a little of the uranium-235, 
90-percent enriched). Of course, no chase ensued: The plant 
managers only learned of the loss several months later, at the 
same time as the world public. However, there is nothing to be 
surprised about here -- it is most probable that the manager 
placed too much trust in the words of Atomic Energy Minister 
Viktor Mikhaylov, who declared at roughly the very same moment 
that all fissionable materials at Atomic Energy Ministry 
enterprises were monitored in the strictest possible manner and 
that, personally, he did not know of a single documented 
incidence of "radioactive larceny." 
  At home, using scales normally employed for weighing 
potatoes, our hero weighed up his spoils -- the arrow on the 
scales stopped at 3 kg (the primitive instrument ignored the 
50-gram makeweight). Then the precious brown powder was 
concealed in an ordinary closet prior to the arrival of the 
"businessmen" from the northern capital. You have to agree that 
the technique for handling radioactive materials typical of some 
workers at Atomic Energy Ministry enterprises arouses at the 
very least respect for the heroic profession of the "nuclear 
scientists" -- for people such as these, even 10 Chernobyls are 
nothing to fear! 
  The butcher and his St. Petersburg friends -- a plumber and 
a 
man temporarily out of work -- did not delay but came for the 
goods on the very next train. They proved themselves somewhat 
more skilled: They asked their host for packaging to ensure 
safe transportation. However, not all the powder would fit into 
the small metal tube proffered (which, if we are honest, is also 
a doubtful defense against irradiation), and the remaining grams 
were put into an ordinary half-liter can. The commodity was 
transported in a regular passenger car on a Moscow-St. 
Petersburg train, and the totally unsuspecting passengers would 
have been highly surprised, had somebody happened to have a 
dosimeter to hand. 
  When, on arrival in Pushkin, the "merchants" put the uranium 
in a refrigerator (so as not to let it spoil?) and set off 
around the city markets in search of purchasers, their every 
move was already being monitored by the St. Petersburg secret 
service (it was impossible to ascertain at what stage precisely 
which respectable citizen "grassed" to the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service). The counterintelligence agents 
did not intent to pounce on them immediately -- it was essential 
to establish how many people were mixed up in the uranium deals. 
However, the quest for purchasers dragged on without success -- 
in many ways because, out of ignorance, the butcher and the 
plumber were asking exorbitant prices, some five or six times 
over the real value per gram of strategic raw material. The 
counterintelligence agents could no longer allow these guys to 
continue freely roaming the streets of St. Petersburg with 
samples of uranium -- this was dangerous, and the time had 
finally come to think about the health of the people living next 
door to the ill-fated Pushkin apartment with the uranium lying 
on a shelf in the refrigerator. Following the operation to 
intercept the men carried out by officers from the "Grad" 
operative-combat group, the apartment had to be decontaminated. 
  Despite the fact that the counterintelligence agents have 
not 
succeeded in identifying the channels through which radioactive 
materials are flowing out from Russia to the West, this 
operation can be considered a success -- after all, the entire 
quantity of uranium, down to the last gram, was returned to the 
state. Admittedly, nobody will undertake to guarantee that it 
will not "disappear" without trace at another Atomic Energy 
Ministry plant -- except, perhaps, a few top officials from the 
Ministry for Atomic Energy itself, who according to our 
information our preparing another denial for disingenuous 
critics. We will report on this at another time.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Krayukhin: "Necessary to Do Without </F>
Electricity During White Nights"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- The "Lentransgaz" Production 
Association has delivered a tough ultimatum to the "Lenenergo" 
Joint-Stock Company -- it is threatening to stop supplying gas 
to all St. Petersburg's power stations as of 21 June as a result 
of outstanding debts. 
  The penalty [neustoyka] has reached the immense figure of 60 
billion rubles. While cast in the role of debtor, the 
"Lenenergo" Joint-Stock Company, for its part, cannot obtain the 
money owed to it by its own big customers -- enterprises in the 
former "defense sector." For the people of St. Petersburg the 
result of this clash between the two giants could be that their 
apartments will be lit at the end of June not by electricity, 
but by the dim glow of the white nights.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- President of Russia's 
breakaway Chechen Republic Dzhokhar Dudayev accused Russian 
authorities of "political blackmail" after the Russian Transport 
Ministry suspended all regular flights to Chechnya since the 
latter failed to guarantee safety of aircraft over Groznyy. 
  "The action has shown the world community once again that 
the 
Russian leadership does not adhere to any principles, except to 
those of political blackmail and terrorism", Dudayev said. 
  A source in the Chechen Information Ministry told TASS by 
telephone that the action is assessed in the republic as a 
declaration of an air blockade of Chechnya ordered by Russia's 
political leadership. 
  The Chechen Foreign Ministry's statement circulated on 
Friday, qualified the decision to suspend flights as "not 
corresponding to the norms of international law and delivering 
serious damage to the relations between the two countries". 
  The statement suggested the flights to Chechnya be resumed 
and qualified the reference to the alleged lack of flight safety 
as not corresponding to reality.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Pachegina under the "Chechen Republic" </F>
rubric: "Opposition Had a Hand in 12 and 13 June Events, State 
Security Chief Geliskhanov Thinks"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It has emerged from a 
telephone conversation with Sultan Geliskhanov, head of 
Chechnya's state security department, that the earlier quoted 
figure of 50 criminals was greatly understated. Geliskhanov 
maintained that at least 300 to 400 bandits offered resistance 
to the government troops in the residential district. The 
ringleaders' names, he said, are still being checked out, but it 
is now clear that in addition to Labazanov who is hiding from 
justice (he and his close associates escaped from the sealed 
area 30 minutes before the storming leaving his fighting men to 
the mercy of fate) and a heavily wounded Suleymanov (who is 
being treated as an outpatient and being closely guarded by 
state security operatives of Chechnya) there were men from 
another group -- the one led by Temishev -- acting among the 
criminals. The head of the Chechen security service has no 
doubt that the names of some other "activists" will become known 
in time. But these facts and the operational-detection work 
begun by his department give grounds to assert that leaders of 
the anti-Dudayev opposition were directly involved in the 12 and 
13 June events in Groznyy. Geliskhanov assured NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA that he has at his disposal information that the armed 
action by the Labazanov-Suleymanov group was only part of the 
action planned by the opposition for 13 June. For reasons still 
unknown to Geliskhanov's department, the opposition let down the 
"criminals" by breaking an agreement on a joint action against 
the authorities. 
  The confidential tone of the conversation with NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA must have been what made it possible for Geliskhanov to 
declare that the war of the republic's authorities on the 
criminal world will continue, and very soon. The place of 
deployment, the numerical strength of the gangs and the weapons 
they have -- all these things are known. The government troops 
will begin in the coming few days to eliminate three more groups 
like the one already destroyed. In the opinion of the head of 
the state security of Chechnya, both the attempt on the life of 
the president in late May and the Labazanov-Suleymanov armed 
rebellion (for which purpose, Geliskhanov thinks, Khoza 
Suleymanov was released from the Russian "Butyrka" prison) were 
organized by Russia, which took advantage of the anti-Dudayev 
opposition's burning desire to come back to power in the 
republic. In his exclusive wish to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Sultan 
Geliskhanov remarked "it's time to stop trusting people who bill 
themselves as politicians," and added that "both in Chechnya and 
in Russia they have paid in blood for this sort of myopia."

    [Editorial Report] Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in 
Russian at 1118 GMT on 17 June broadcasts a report from 
Krasnoyarsk where Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray 
is leading a special commission at work there today. He 
assessed the situation regarding the delivery of cargo to the 
Russian far north as an "emergency." 
  He says that the Russian Government will do everything 
possible to ensure that fuel and food are delivered in full to 
the northerners, though there will be difficulties with 
technical cargo and building materials, most of which have not 
yet been delivered to the river and sea ports. 
  The Yenisey River Shipping Line manager has said that only a 
third of its 2,200 vessels are ready for the navigation season 
since customers have failed to pay for the 1993 delivery season 
and conclude new agreements for this season. This has resulted 
in many of the staff being sent off on enforced holidays. Some 
have started resigning. 
  It was pointed out at a meeting between the government 
commission and heads of administration of the northern regions 
of Krasnoyarsk Kray and the Taymir and Evenkiy autonomous 
districts that money had been allocated from the federal budget, 
but only for the delivery of goods. 
  Shakhray told ITAR-TASS on the issue of northerners leaving 
the north that a total flight of people from there should be 
prevented. Northerners should be given assistance in relocation. 
He hopes that they will be relocated to eastern regions of 
Russia where the climate is similar to that of the northern 
regions and where the jobs' issue is not so difficult. 
  Shakhray stresses that the Russian north and polar regions 
are very important to the country's economy and they have a 
future. People should work on a shift basis and not live there 
permanently. 
  The deputy prime minister also points out at a final news 
conference that "in spite of all the economic difficulties, we 
will continue to allocate money for the needs of the indigenous 
peoples of the north. These people have nowhere to go and they 
must have a humane standard of living."

  [Aminov] At a news conference given straight after the 
signing of the agreement it was said that an agreement of this 
kind strengthens Russia as a great and distinctive state that 
contains many curious phenomenon. 
  Boris Yeltsin is perhaps the only person in Russia's 
leadership who really understands what a federation is, Yuriy 
Spiridonov said. It is good that he is president, Mintimer 
Shaymiyev said, agreeing. Both leaders believe that the time is 
not far off when the federation treaty issue will have to be 
tackled again and the federation will be built up from below, 
taking into account the interests of the republics and the 
regions. 
  Russia's oil-producing regions, which include Tatarstan and 
Komi, today founded a consortium to jointly manage the export of 
fuel. The agreement promises to be mutually advantageous. 
  Both leaders agreed on closer cooperation at the Federation 
Council level, too, although they were of the opinion that that 
body had yet to assume a proper role and did not have any real 
influence on the situation.
