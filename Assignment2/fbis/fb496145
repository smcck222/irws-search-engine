<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>
  [Text] Kazan June 20 TASS -- Vice-President of Tatarstan 
Vasiliy Likhachev characterised the Russian-Tatarstan 
power-sharing treaty as a "most functional document". He 
praised Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree ordering the 
foundation of a committee to regulate the implementation of the 
treaty. An analogous committee has already been formed in 
Tatarstan. 
  The vice-president said his republic's treaty with the 
Russian Federation was the first document in Russia's history 
which established constructive cooperation between a region and 
the centre. He noted that the Tatarstan commission already has 
a specific programme for the agreement's realisation. For 
example, Tatarstan plans to play a role in federal-level 
economic programmes, such as the ones for the production of 
Tu-204-200 aircraft, cars, and oil-tankers. 
  Yeltsin's decree is a significant step forward in the 
implementation of radical reforms aimed at turning Russia into a 
truly democratic federation, Likhachev commented.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "B. Yeltsin Has Made </F>
Suggestions To His Subordinates Concerning Results of His Trip 
to the Amur District, Tuva, and Novosibirsk"] 
  [Text] President B. Yeltsin's return from a three-day tour 
of the country -- he visited Blagoveshchensk, Tuva, and 
Novosibirsk -- has not been covered by television and the 
newspapers. But it was at this concluding stage of the program 
that the impressions which the president took away from his trip 
seem to have emerged. At an improvised conference at the 
airport lounge (O. Soskovets, A. Shokhin, A. Zaveryukha, P. 
Grachev, A. Kozyrev, V. Yerin, S. Filatov, and other 
high-ranking officials were present) the president imparted his 
impressions and, most important, demanded an investigation of 
many problems which have become obvious to him. 
  In Blagoveshchensk he agreed with the oblast leadership's 
suggestion to leave up to 20 percent of the gold that is mined 
in the local budget. But with regard to the privatization of 
gold mines he said: "We still have to look at the matter...." 
Obviously he was informed of the unhealthy situation in the 
oblast connected with the auctioning off of the Pokrovskoye 
deposit. According to local journalists it was sold for 12 
billion rubles [R] while its real cost is something like 2-3 
trillion. And for some reason the auction was organized in such 
a way that the opportunities for bidding were limited and as a 
result the titbit went to the "Tokur zoloto" company. In this 
connection even the local prosecutor's office has protested. 
  The president demanded that his subordinates investigate the 
privatization of large industrial establishments and mineral 
deposits around which fighting between the "money-bags" has 
broken out. 
  In the Amur district there was also a discussion of the 
project to construct a cosmodrome on the basis of a strategic 
missile division. The president did not make a decision there 
but promised to think it all over. In Moscow he demanded that 
the military department and other officials work on this 
scenario and submit their ideas to him very soon. 
  At the airport there was also talk of the situation in Tuva. 
In Kyzyl after a conference with the local leadership B. 
Yeltsin, at a meeting with workers of Tuva's power structures, 
promised to give money for the construction of a sheepskin 
factory. "We will give as much money as you can assimilate," he 
said, which gave rise to applause from the workers of the 
president's apparatus and the Supreme Hural. He also promised 
help for the development of their water transport. According to 
some calculations at least R40 billion will be required for this 
just for a start. Then an unexpected phrase was heard which 
shocked many people, primarily A. Shokhin. 
  "I forbid all government officials and all presidential 
structures from demanding that the republic earn money for 
itself and not be subsidized. That is impossible. The 
necessary economic infrastructure does not exist in the 
republic. It must be created gradually. The Amur district is 
another matter. Everything necessary exists there and I 
criticized the local leadership for its lack of initiative." 
  At "Vnukovo-2" he said more or less the following: Not all 
republics can be treated the same. From this demand of the 
president's it may be concluded that today he prefers to pay off 
Kyzyl with money rather than have political problems. As we 
know the republic has adopted a Constitution which opens up an 
opportunity for it to leave Russia. Local nationalists are 
exploiting this subject, although they have no real support 
among the people.

  [Text] The Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCIS) 
intends to take an active part in ensuring security in the free 
economic zone Nakhodka situated in Russia's Far East. 
  Chief of the FCIS Public Relations Center Aleksandr 
Mikhailov 
reported to Interfax Saturday that Director of the service 
Sergey Stepashin who was on an inspection trip throughout this 
region this week commissioned local counterintelligence officers 
to fulfil this task. 
  In Mikhailov's words, separate criminal clans use the 
opportunities of the free economic zone to inflict damage to the 
economy of the country as a whole and to the economy of the Far 
East in particular. 
  Stepashin called counterintelligence officers to adopt all 
necessary measures to ensure normal functioning of Nakhodka free 
economic zone.

  [Text] Stage two of a large-scale border operation, 
codenamed Putina (Fishing Season), has got under way in the 
Pacific. 
  As Colonel Aleksandr Suvorov, a spokesman for the Russian 
border troops, has told INTERFAX, the action aims at curbing 
border infiltration, halting trawling in Russia's territorial 
waters and export of illegally caught sea products, as well as 
safeguarding the environment. 
  Units of the North-Eastern Border District and Pacific 
District resumed the operation on Sunday. Taking part will be 
up to 60 percent of the border district's ships and aircraft, 
and about 10 percent of its arms have been set aside for reserve. 
  During Putina's first stage that lasted from April 20 to May 
10, four Japanese and 16 Russian boats were detained for border 
violations. The sum of imposed fines amounted to 202 million 
rubles and 15,000 dollars. Legal proceedings were initiated 
against two Russian captains. 
  The prevented damage is estimated at 120 billion rubles.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy: "`Rostselmash' Is Not </F>
Producing Combines"] 
  [Text] Industry in Rostov, the largest industrial center 
on the Don, has been practically paralyzed. Since the start of 
the year not a single combine has been produced by the 
"Rostselmash" Joint-Stock Company, the flagship of national 
agricultural machine-building. At the same time there are no 
crowds of unemployed people on the city streets. 
  The reason is that the firm's directors are trying by every 
possible means to preserve jobs, thereby creating hidden 
unemployment, which has exceeded 5 percent in the city. At the 
same time official unemployment stands at less than half a 
percent. Of course, this policy prevents a social explosion, 
but at the same time it also hampers structural restructuring of 
the economy and the flow of cadres into spheres where they can 
be more profitably used. Many people believe that the reserves 
of this policy have been exhausted, and when the real 
bankruptcies of cumbersome monsters begin, the number of people 
wending their way to the employment service will increase by an 
order of magnitude. Are they ready for this? 
  "We are ready," I was told at Rostov City Employment Center. 
"We have more than 150 specialists and all our work stations are 
computerized. Over 100 computers link Rostov City Employment 
Center with eight rayon employment centers, and with the 
imminent introduction of modems these will be linked in a single 
information network. This will make it easier for the 
unemployed to find work." 
  A number of strong service departments have been formed 
within the center. The main one aims to facilitate job 
placement and employment support. Since the start of this year, 
half of the 5,000 people who have come to this department have 
found work. This is not a bad result in the present 
circumstances. Unemployment benefit is also issued here, and is 
received by approximately 1,500 people. 
  But the most important aspect, the center believes, is the 
accelerated creation of new jobs and an active policy on the 
labor market. Over 2 billion rubles have already been earmarked 
for this since the start of the year. Of these, 100 million 
have been received by the "Bearing Plant" Joint-Stock Company, 
where they have started assembling KamAZ trucks using Volga 
components. They have already returned the money.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr </F>
Tushinskiy by Captain A. Lebedev; place and date not given: 
"Conversion Needs a Strong Legal Base"] 
  [Excerpts] [Lebedev] Since the definition of conversion by 
some media is pretty vague, could you specify the meaning of 
this word? What are the goals of conversion and since when has 
it been under way? 
  [Tushinskiy] Speaking about conversion, it is very important 
that we distinguish between changing the profile of defense 
industry enterprises and exploiting their capacity -- as a 
result of trimming the Belarusian Armed Forces potential -- for 
civilian needs. Both are otherwise connected with the Army. 
  Of course, the goals of these two directions of conversion 
are different. Conversion in the defense industry enterprises 
is designed to reduce military production and reorient their 
capacity and employees, which were left without any work, toward 
civilian production. On the other hand, conversion of military 
potential is aimed at consistently engaging the Army's part of 
scientific and human potential, available as a result of 
military scale-downs, in the social sphere of industry. 
  Both directions began in 1991 and are proceeding in several 
stages. This year marks the beginning of a transitional period. 
Today, the scientific and technical support of conversion is on 
the agenda. 
  [Lebedev] Do those conversion programs have specific 
managers? 
  [Tushinskiy] We established conversion departments at the 
State Industrial Committee and the Ministry of Economy, as well 
as the Department of International Security and Disarmament at 
the Foreign Ministry. Their role is limited to providing expert 
judgment concerning proposed programs. Legally, all 
enterprises, including those working for the military, are 
independent; so they bear single-handed responsibility for 
conversion, as well. Our ministry has the Conversion of 
Military Facilities Department. 
  Technically, the "pie" of responsibility for conversion 
seems 
to be carved up. However, the industry covered by conversion is 
very important as it is closely linked with national security. 
This is why this industry has no place for the provincial 
mindset. Conversion must be managed by a single center which 
would coordinate efforts of all links of the conversion chain, 
including the Defense Ministry and enterprises. For this 
purpose, we have already sent the Cabinet of Ministers a 
proposal to set up the State Commission for Conversion and 
Military Industrial Questions that could become such a center. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Lebedev] Conversion of defense industry enterprises reduces 
military orders. The intention is clear: One is supposed to 
live by his means and spend money wisely. I am wondering, 
however, where are the limits beyond which a drop in production 
is inadmissible? After all, we are putting at risk our national 
defense potential. 
  [Tushinskiy] Of course, one should not live beyond his 
means. 
However, the fact is that more than half the industrial capacity 
of developed countries is dedicated to the defense of their 
states, compared with only 4 percent in Belarus. Unfortunately, 
we have long overstepped those limits. 
  There are many reasons for this. The reduction of military 
orders was caused by the collapse on the domestic market of 
Russia's Defense Exports Committee, with which we cooperated. 
However, we must not let conversion devour something that we 
will need tomorrow to maintain our combat readiness -- our high 
technology and the expertise of our professionals. The military 
industry needs orders. To get them, our state should make bolder 
efforts to enter those foreign markets where our technology is 
more advanced. 
  However, some of our politicians do not think about it. The 
most important thing for them is to play their political card 
and make a career. Take, for example, Deputy Lukashenko, who 
said that by trading in arms Belarus discredits itself as a 
neutral country. He is doing a great disservice to his country 
and its combat readiness. I do not know about his professional 
skills, but he does not seem to understand the principles of a 
market economy and conditions that are vital for our combat 
readiness. If anyone, a deputy must understand this. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Lebedev] As we know, the Belarusian conversion plan is 
carried out with the help of U.S. investments as part of the 
U.S. Nunn-Lugar act. Can you say a few words about its goals 
and advantages? 
  [Tushinskiy] In the opinion of U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry, the financing of our conversion plans removes the 
nuclear threat to the United States on the part of Belarus. The 
Americans have earmarked $20 million for this purpose. However, 
this aid does not come in the form of money. They directly put 
their investments into the reequipment of our enterprises and 
retraining of our personnel. The joint conversion plans 
primarily cover Minsk defense giants, such as "Integral," the 
"Computing Equipment" Science and Production Amalgamation, and 
BelOMO. This promotes the integration of Belarusian enterprises 
into the world market. So it is to each side's advantage. This 
year, Belarus will receive a total of $100 million. 
  [Lebedev] America called upon its allies to join the 
Belarusian conversion program. Did it receive any response? 
  [Tushinskiy] Yes, as of today, we have received a response 
from Japan. Our governments signed an agreement securing $5 
million for Belarus to conduct a number of measures preventing 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the installment 
of ecologically safe storage conditions for radioactive 
substances. 
  [Lebedev] Defense enterprises in all countries are closed to 
unasked eyes, especially foreign. In Belarus, foreign 
specialists were invited to work at these kind of facilities. 
Do we not fear for our super-advanced technologies? 
  [Tushinskiy] Let me disagree with you on only one thing. 
Western defense enterprises are open, even to foreign eyes. I 
myself had the chance to visit a couple of them as a member of 
military delegations. The production process at such sites is 
exactly the same as at civilian enterprises. The time of 
"underground plants" is long past. 
  Presently, enterprises protect only the most advanced 
technologies, which you cannot see with a trained eye. 
Generally speaking, so-called intellectual property should be 
protected by law. Belarus has not yet developed such a law. So, 
we will guard our national "know-how" with a package of 
administrative measures. 
  [Lebedev] The collapse of the Soviet Union introduced 
substantial corrections into the material and technical support 
of the Belarusian Armed Forces. But we still need weapons, 
equipment, ammunition, and production. Do the national 
conversion programs take this into account? 
  [Tushinskiy] By all means. For example, the Minsk 
Automobile Plant is finishing development work on two models of 
transportation vehicles for our Armed Forces. 
  [Lebedev] Has the conversion of Belarusian defense 
enterprises and the military potential of the Belarusian Armed 
Forces produced any specific results? 
  [Tushinskiy] I think it would be more correct for me to 
simply point to a number of enterprises which have successfully 
changed their profiles. These are first of all our leaders, 
BelOMO and "Integral." The Homel Radio Equipment Plant has also 
succeeded in this. What should be noted about this plant is 
that until recently, it turned out 90 percent of all military 
production. Now, it manufactures the same amount of civilian 
products. 
  As part of the conversion process, the Lida Optics Plant now 
manufactures glass lenses instead of optical equipment for space. 
  The U.S.-Belarusian "Belkonvers" joint venture can also be 
called a fruit of conversion. Based on U.S. technology, it 
recycles conventional ammunition. Also deserving of attention 
is the experience of the "Transaviaeksport" company, which 
employs IL-76 transportation aircraft to train military crews 
and fill commercial transportation orders serving the Republic's 
interests. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Rostikov: "Zenon Pozniak's </F>
Anti-Russian Accent"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The people of Belarus, whose diligence, 
composure, and tolerance are legendary, are not changing 
character as they approach their first presidential elections. 
They are well aware that, out of the six registered candidates, 
only incumbent Prime Minister V. Kebich and A. Lukashenko, a 
former state farm director and former chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet Anticorruption Commission, have the best chance of 
success. 
  Clearly pressuring them, Z. Pozniak, leader of the 
Belorussian [Belarusian] People's Front [BPF], has been making 
great advances recently. Head of a rural club, a professional 
photographer, theater expert, and archaeologist, he entered the 
political scene in the late eighties on the wave of revelations 
about Stalin's crimes. He became well known throughout the 
region for discovering and publicizing the site at Kuropaty near 
Minsk where NKVD prisoners were gunned down. 
  Pozniak has irrevocably chosen the path of nationalism. This 
method has already worked well on the territory of certain 
republics of the former USSR and has yielded its adherents good 
dividends. Nationalism is the last phase of communism, the last 
attempt by an obsolete ideology to rid itself of responsibility 
for the past. It is always foreigners who are to blame -- that 
is every nationalist's conviction. Nor does it take long to 
work out who those foreigners are -- the Russians. 
  In Belarus, which has always lived in the closest union with 
Russia -- the two peoples were united by the deepest ties of 
kinship -- this niche naturally remained unfilled. Pozniak 
filled it and tirelessly set about exposing "imperial Russia" 
and the "imperial Russian people" who brought to Belarus nothing 
but an "anticulture, boorishness, dissoluteness, drunkenness, 
Russian foul language, idleness, hatred, and lies." 
  Who forms the basis of the support of the BPF and its leader 
Pozniak? There is the community of dilettantes in various 
spheres of intellectual activity, first and foremost in science 
and art. As a rule, these people are from an urban background 
and their knowledge of life comes from the communal kitchens and 
from narrow gatherings of like-minded people who are alienated 
from the profundity of a world culture which seems hostile to 
them and who assert their national culture at the level of 
amateur folk events. There is another force on which the BPF 
leader is undoubtedly counting -- the steadily growing stratum 
of society's dregs, whose only occupation since the very 
beginning of perestroyka has been to huddle together at rallies 
and processions and, with raucous cries, voice the "people's" 
indignation. This is not just the lumpen proletariat, but a 
special variety of it -- the lumpen intelligentsia. From their 
midst emerged a belligerent and fairly well organized detachment 
-- the Belorusian Association of Servicemen -- which donned 
uniforms and was not averse to a little saber rattling. Small 
businessmen have been infiltrating this circle, making money 
from the rampant rise in prices and the customs barriers which 
operated until recently in the east. The national card is also 
keenly played by the men of letters, who want to preserve the 
privileges that they enjoyed in the communist era -- the 
enormous print runs which no one ever bought, the royalties, 
and, most importantly, the attention lavished on them by the 
authorities. It is typical that the culture minister in 
Pozniak's "shadow" government has been publicly stating that the 
Russian language should be excluded from school syllabuses and 
could be "temporarily banned" altogether, that the publication 
and study of Russian writers should be stopped, and that such an 
"anti-Belarusian" work as Glinka's opera "Ivan Susanin" should 
be removed from the stage. And, of course, the "foreigners" 
should be thrown out. To these people a foreigner is anyone who 
uses Russian. "There is no place for them on Belarusian soil. 
These people should be sent back to Russia. The Russians and 
Belarusians are different people." Yet it is Russian that the 
bulk of the Republic's population speaks! 
  Just who are these foreigners who have filled our land? 
For a long time now the Vietnamese have only been seen trading 
in the market places and the Chinese have not reached Belarus 
yet. The Americans and other Western "staffers" are only to be 
seen at the BPF's headquarters and hardly constitute a "foreign 
work force." It is more likely that they provide work for 
others. So the logical question to put to the zealous 
presidential contender is this: If the inscription 
"nationality" is to be removed from Belarusians' passports, will 
he not introduce the inscription "native language" so as to 
immediately determine who is a citizen of Belarus and who is a 
foreigner? And will this paragraph not be ratified by the law 
barring certain people from certain professions, which is 
already tacitly operating in some parts of our country now? 
  Five years ago no one could even have conceived that many of 
the newspapers and magazines in Belarus would be filled with 
anti-Russian articles or that an entire congress of writers 
would stand to greet with rapturous applause a presidential 
contender who insulted a fraternal Slav people with these words: 
"This is a rag-bag of a people without a clearly defined 
national territory, alternating with Finno-Ugric, Turkic, Mongol 
and other enclaves, and scattered among colonies in Siberia and 
Asia. Its dominant consciousness is not national but imperial 
in essence...." And the presidential contender's special wrath 
is aroused by a Russian minister's statement that "they intend 
to defend the rights not just of the ethnic Russians but of the 
Russian speakers...." 
  It goes without saying that Pozniak calls the existence of 
the Russian state itself into question. Indeed, in the 
presidential contender's mind it no longer exists. "Siberia, 
Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Far East, Ukraine, Moldova, and 
Belarus must find their own paths.... The creation of a Russian 
national state is not ruled out," Pozniak graciously adds. 
  His hatred of Russia and the Russians knows no bounds. But 
is it only the Russians? 
  Pozniak's ideas extend even further: "...The question of the 
return of the east Belarusian lands will be raised again. Along 
with the questions of compensation for the Chernobyl disaster, 
the USSR gold reserve, property abroad, and so forth. Further 
efforts will be made to...create a Baltic-Black Sea association 
of states and, in the long term, of all the states of East and 
Central Europe -- the former `socialist camp' -- apart from 
Russia." 
  He is categorically opposed to any unification of the 
currency system between Russia and Belarus and promises that "a 
stable Belarusian currency will be introduced. That will stop 
inflation and the rise in prices. It will fill the stores with 
high-quality goods." 
  Pozniak has been intimidating the voters by saying that 
"Russia will wage an economic war aimed at destroying the 
republic's economy." 
  Recently some Moscow newspapers have begun claiming that Z. 
Pozniak had a drastic change of attitude toward Russia on the 
eve of the presidential elections. Would that it were so. Here 
is his statement to a correspondent from SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA 
(9 June 1994): "Your view is wrong. Russian policy toward 
Belarus has not changed for centuries. Therefore, my attitude 
toward that country is unchanged, too. Russia, as a vast 
Eurasian state with an imperial history and ideology, still 
exists, no matter how it is dressed up -- it was, is, and will 
remain the enemy of our Belarusian independence and our freedom. 
We must proceed from this incontrovertible truth and it alone 
when building our real state relations with the East." 
  Pozniak has mounted his favorite hobby horse and, spurring 
it 
on with nationalist and anti-Russian ideas, is clearly setting 
his sights at the presidency. 
  But is he not overestimating his own chances of success?

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Refugees Occupy `Radioactive' Villages"] </F>
  [Text] Under the onslaught of refugees from Central Asia 
the Gomel Oblast authorities have been obliged to "open up" 
villages clogged with radioactive weeds. 
  Having learned of the opportunity for acquiring housing, 
refugees are rushing here from the CIS trouble spots. They come 
knowing that the local inhabitants are subject to enforced or 
voluntary removal. They are fleeing poverty and dobule-dyed 
nationalism and, they say, are choosing the lesser of two evils. 
In all of last year alone, about 2,300 people including over 700 
children arrived in radioactive Gomel Oblast. This year the 
oblast took in a further 300 refugees.

  [Text] Epidemiologists in Brest are alarmed. In some 
villages near the center of the oblast, outbreaks of an 
especially dangerous and infectious disease -- swine plague 
[chuma sviney] -- have been recorded. This is an unusual 
incident, because the disease wipes out pigs of any breed and 
any age. The (?greatest) danger is posed by the meat of the 
infected pigs, which are being slaughtered. Their meat may only 
be safely used after thermal processing and even then, only for 
preparing stewed sausages and canned meat. 
  The Brest Rayon Executive Committee has imposed a quarantine 
in all infected regions. During this quarantine, all exports 
and imports of pigs, as well as the grazing of cattle at 
collective farms, are forbidden; transportation movement is also 
limited. Other regions of the oblast are also alarmed; free, 
large-scale swine vaccination campaigns are already being 
implement in those areas.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Valeriy Demidetskiy, </F>
Anatoliy Kholodyuk] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau], 19 Jun -- The second 
anniversary of the Bendery tragedy was commemorated in the 
Dniester region today. 
  Exactly two years ago, this area on the banks of the 
Dniester 
river was engulfed in a bloodbath, which left hundreds dead and 
thousands refugees. The madness was halted on 21 July 1992 when 
an agreement was signed in Moscow between Moldavia [Moldova] and 
Russia and a contingent of combined Russian, Moldavian, and 
Dniester peacekeeping troops was sent into the conflict zone. 
Thanks to their efforts, a fragile peace has been maintained in 
the area and talks have begun on finding a peaceful settlement 
for the crisis. Russia and the CSCE are mediating at these. 
This was announced at a rally today in Bendery attended by 
thousands in memory of those killed. 
  At the rally, a speech by 14th Army Commander General 
Aleksandr Lebed was greeted by whistles when he criticized the 
leadership of the Dniester region, accusing it of corruption and 
reluctance to solve the conflict by peaceful means. Among other 
things, the general said in his speech that the Tiraspol leaders 
repaid Russia with base ingratitude when it sent its fighters to 
Moscow during last year's October events.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Vladimir Nikishin, commander of the </F>
Regiment of Russian Peacemaking Forces in the Dniester Region, 
by Senior Lieutenant Artur Gulko; place and date not given, 
under the "Life of the Troops" rubric: "Peacekeeping Forces in 
the Dniester Region: Too Soon To Return Home Yet"] 
  [Text] The regiment of Russian peacemaking forces 
commanded by Colonel Vladimir Nikishin recently fulfilled its 
peacemaking mission in the Dniester Region. This is the second 
time. The regiment's officers and men separated the opposing 
sides in summer 1992. 
  Our nonstaff correspondent's conversation with the regiment 
commander focused on the everyday lives of the peacemaking 
troops from the Volga Military District. 
  [Gulko] Vladimir Fedorovich, what is the situation like 
today in the region where your regiment was operating? 
  [Nikishin] Just like last year, the regiment fulfilled its 
duties in the heightened security zone on both banks of the 
Dniester River. It served at five posts in accordance with the 
documents of the joint control commission. On the right bank it 
served together with peacemakers from Moldavia [Moldova] and at 
seven posts on the left bank together with people from the 
Dniester Region. There are also posts in Dubossary, Bendery, 
and at the Kitskany bridgehead... 
  Our main mission was to perform the functions of military 
observers, to monitor the movement of combat hardware and 
troops, and to inspect transport which might possibly be 
carrying weapons, ammunition, explosives, or drugs. Thanks to 
strict monitoring the shipment of this entire range of goods 
through the Dniester Region has virtually ceased. But this does 
not mean that the peacemakers are no longer needed here. 
Everything is peaceful in Moldavia today but the Russian 
soldiers are still the guarantors of stability in the region. 
  The attitude toward our officers and men on the part of 
local 
inhabitants on both sides of the Dniester is the very best. And 
that is true despite the reports filtering into the Moldavian 
mass media about the urgent need for the withdrawal of the 
peacemaking forces from the region. 
  [Gulko] The specific conditions of your service have surely 
had an impact on the combat training process. What are the 
characteristic features of that training in the Dniester Region? 
  [Nikishin] Exercises were planned and organized according to 
the program for the training of Russia's peacemaking units. 
They were held on a daily basis, according to a schedule, and 
involved all personnel apart from those on actual service. Fire 
practice took place at the 14th guard's army range, the 
remaining subjects were studied at our own base at Bendery in an 
old fortress reminiscent of the Russian Army in Aleksandr 
Vasilyevich Suvorov's time. 
  Admittedly, the shortage of officers and NCO's at 
platoon-company level took its toll: We had 10 officer 
vacancies and 17 NCO vacancies. People were in no hurry to come 
here, for understandable reasons... Including social reasons. 
  [Gulko] But it has been stated numerous times at various 
levels that the social and everyday problems facing men serving 
in the "hot spots" have all but been resolved. There are, after 
all, laws which provide various privileges... 
  [Nikishin] Those privileges have not been prescribed for us. 
The peacemaking forces are only covered by the defense 
minister's order on privileges -- unlike the 14th Army, which 
enjoys privileges laid down by edict of the Russian Federation 
President for servicemen serving in the "hot spots." Why is 
that? Formally speaking we are serving in the Volga Military 
District. However, we were stationed in the Dniester Region not 
through choice, but from the state's need, a fact which is not 
taken into account. 
  Of course, we made our own efforts to obtain privileges for 
officers and NCO's. For example, we are doing a lot to that end 
at the winter quarters in Totskoye. Officers, NCO's, and men 
were sent on regular furloughs. In short, we tried to keep 
people's spirits up. But all that, of course, is not enough. 
Now we have been relieved by the regiment under the command of 
Colonel Aleksandr Grigoryev and I hope that our wishes will be 
taken into account when it comes to providing backup for its 
service.

for this step was that the government did not involve her in 
tackling many of the painful and urgent problems, and that 
proposals submitted by her ministry remained unheeded.

  [Text] A regular Security Council session, chaired by 
President Nazarbayev, was held yesterday. At issue were 
questions related to the state of equipment of the Armed Forces 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan with technology, armaments, 
material, and technical resources. The concept of formation and 
implementation of long-term defense programs and development of 
the defense complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan were also 
examined. General Sagadat Nurmagambetov, the defense minister, 
and Economy Minister Mars Urkumbayev presented reports. An 
exchange of opinions was held, summed up by Nursultan 
Nazarbayev: We must precisely decide what an army needs -- how 
many men we need -- he said. We should urgently tackle all 
questions connected with equipping the Armed Forces, we should, 
to a maximum degree, reduce import of military products from 
outside, and to the best of our possibilities manufacture such 
products in Kazakhstan. The head of state set an objective--in 
one week's time--to set up a commission on the military 
industry. Its chairman will be directly responsible for the 
situation in this important sphere, which should provide 
reliable defense capability for our sovereign state. 
  By their decision, the Security Council approved of the 
concept of formation and implementation of long-term defense 
programs and development of the defense complex. The council 
also endorsed several changes in its membership. In particular, 
Bulat Baekenov was appointed secretary of the council. 
  Speaker Abish Kekilbayev, Akizhan Kazhegeldin, first deputy 
prime minister, Deputy Prime ministers Galym Abilsiitov and 
Asygat Zhabagin, and heads of a number of ministries and 
departments, as well as responsible officials from the 
presidential administration and that of the Cabinet of Ministers 
participated in the session.

  [Text] An edict by the president of the Republic of 
Kazakhstan on the regulations connected to publishing and 
implementing the president's legal acts. With the view to 
upgrade the procedure for publishing and making valid legal acts 
by the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan, I decree: 
  1. Acts by the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
should be published in the brochure "The collection of acts by 
the president of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the republican 
government" published in the issue right after its endorsement 
and also in the newspapers EGEMENDY KAZAKHSTAN, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA 
PRAVDA, KHALYK KENESI, and VESTNIK of KAZAKHSTAN. 
  2. The publication of presidential acts by the above organs 
is regarded official. Presidential acts could also be published 
by other mass media sources, TV and Radio, send by fax, 
telegraph, and distributed among the relevant state and other 
organizations. 
  3. Presidential acts, which contain secret information,

  [Excerpts] A meeting of the union of Kazakh consumer 
cooperative societies was held in Almaty on 17 June. [passage 
omitted] The union is the largest in the Central Asian system, 
which ensures reliable provision to the rural population of 
food, industrial goods, and various services. It is a powerful 
organization that purchases agricultural raw materials and 
provides quality prosessing of it in a most beneficial way. It 
is a full-fledged member of the International Cooperative 
Alliance. Its Kazkoopvneshtorg branch maintains direct trade 
contacts with companies of 35 foreign countries. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Kulagin read out a greeting 
from 
President Nazarbayev. The union of consumer societies, it says, 
have come a long way; its history has been inseparable from that 
of our state. At each stage of the country's development, 
cooperatives made a significant contribution in the improvement 
of the rural population's living standard and strengthening of 
ties between the city and the village. 
  The president suggested that the members of the Republic's 
cooperatives, using their long experience of organization of 
market relations, should quickly restructure their work in 
conformity with the demands of the times.

<F P=106> [Report by KAZTAG correspondent Yesenkul Bekbulatova for </F>
TASS] 
  [Text] Almaty 17 June TASS -- A rally of the Kazakh Attan 
popular movement protested today in front of the Chinese Embassy 
in Almaty against the Chinese nuclear test held at the Lob Nor 
nuclear testing grounds 300 kilometers away from the 
Kazakh-Chinese borders. 
  The rally supported a statement of the Kazakh Foreign 
Ministry, which lamented over another nuclear test in Lob Nor 
fraught with grave consequences for the regional ecology. 
Kazakh residents, which have lived through the 40 years work of 
the Semipalatinsk testing grounds, are especially concerned over 
the fate of future generations, as well as the neighbouring 
areas of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan which also have borders with 
China. 
  "Our demand to stop tests in Lob Nor is not an interference 
in Chinese internal affairs," leader of the Attan Anti-Nuclear 
Movement Amantai Asylbekov told the rally. "It is concern over 
the health of millions of citizens of many regional states. It 
is alarming that the test was held by China while other nuclear 
powers observe the nuclear test moratorium." 
  The peace march that began today near the Chinese Embassy 
will finish on 29 August in New York City near the United 
Nations headquarters. The Attan members together with U.S. 
anti-nuclear activists want to attract the public attention and 
pull efforts to achieve closure of all the nuclear testing 
grounds throughout the world.

  [Text] A massive meeting organized by the Attan public 
movement was held yesterday in Almaty in front of the Chinese 
Embassy to Kazakhstan. The participants of the meeting were 
protesting against nuclear tests held at the Lop Nur testing 
site, which is located only 300 km away from the Kazakh border. 
Multiethnic participants of the meeting expressed support for a 
statement released by the Kazakh Foreign Ministry in connection 
with the explosion at Lop Nur. 
  Kazakhstanis are especially concerned about these tests 
because they have suffered for over 40 years from the tests at 
the Semipalatinsk site and are worried about the fate of their 
future generations. The Kazakh people, who have contributed so 
much to the closure of the Semipalatinsk site, are protesting 
together with the peoples of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, who also 
border on China. There are no borders to protect us against 
nuclear radiation and its consequences. The meeting and rally, 
which began yesterday in front of the Chinese Embassy, will 
finish on 29 August in New York in front of the UN headquarters.

  [Text] President Askar Akayev met a large group of senior 
citizens, veterans of war and labor from Bishkek and all oblasts 
of the country. A long, open, and interested conversation about 
the plight of the Republic, responsibility of the authorities, 
and the nation's unity took place. Without these things there 
is no way out of the crisis and no well-being for the people. 
  The president told the veterans about the situation in the 
Republic, about the authorities' efforts to lift the country out 
of the economic crisis and stabilize the situation. Akayev paid 
special attention to such a worrying tendency as a growing rift 
between the representative and Executive Branches of power, 
between the president and the Zhogorku Kenesh. 
  Dangerous political gambling, intrigues, blackmail, and 
hysterical witch-hunting by certain media will not result in 
anything good. They threaten to divide society and bring about 
a situation similar to those taking place in Tajikistan or 
Russia. 
  The president asked the veterans to use all their wisdom and 
lifelong experience to persuade both deputies and public opinion 
that a course towards confrontation, elucidation of relations, 
and discredit is fruitless and dangerous. I have quite a few 
compromising materials on some of the deputies, the president 
said, and I could have used them at the sessions of the Zhogorku 
Kenesh. But I would not like to resort to this. I would not 
like to discredit the deputies' corps. Let law and order 
enforcement bodies deal with investigations of such materials. 
Our parliament has turned into an investigation commission. 
  The veterans supported the president. They demanded he make 
state power stricter. The heads of local administrations should 
be controlled tougher. The veterans promised [words indistinct]. 
  Rustenbekov, state secretary and head of the presidential 
apparatus, and Sapubek Begaliev, president of the assembly of 
Kyrgyzstani peoples, attended the meeting.

  [Text] A first ever kurultay [meeting] was held by the 
working aksakals [veterans] of the town of Naryn and Naryn Rayon 
and was held in the oblast center. The problem of setting up a 
new administrative territory was discussed. This new territory 
is expected to comprise the town of Naryn and the former 
Tian-Shan Rayon. It was noted that decisive measures are being 
taken in order to implement the presidential edicts on 
extraordinary measures to strengthen the state financial 
discipline, and on measures to deepen the land and agrarian 
reform in Kyrgyzstan. Every peasant association has set up 
rural committees, the activity of which is targeted at 
improvement of the economic and social situation of people. 
  The participants adopted an appeal of the kurultay to Prime 
Minister Dzhumagulov that says that with the transition to a 
market economy, a good prerequisite has emerged that will 
strengthen the unity and solidarity of the Kyrgyz people in the 
spirit of the best traditions of our ancestors. The people 
understand the great economic and political significance of 
merging the town and rayon, the appeal says. By merging, 
artificial barriers are removed between the city and village. 
It is easier to process agricultural raw materials directly, 
without any red tape; and to fully use industrial enterprises 
reserves and labor resources of the agrarian sector. The 
participants in the kurultay assured the head of the government 
that all grounds exist for improving the economic and social 
situation in Naryn.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tajik Labor Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov and </F>
opposition official Ata Khan Latifi by unidentified 
correspondent; including passage by Ramero Perez Ballon, UN 
special envoy to the Tajik peace talks, in English followed by 
further announcer-read remarks by Balloon; in Tehran, date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Direct talks between Tajik Government 
representatives and opposition groups continued in Tehran today. 
Our reporter has separately interviewed Tajik representatives 
as well as opposition members and UN representative. 
  [Correspondent] How hopeful are you about the outcome of 
these talks? 
  [Zuhurov] I think the talks are not going to be very easy; 
however, I hope that while in Tehran we will witness a round of 
fruitful talks between the Tajiks that will lead to a resolution. 
  [Correspondent] What role can Iran play? 
  [Zuhurov] I think Iran can play a major role. Today, during 
the opening session of the talks, I had the feeling that all the 
Iranian people, the Iranian Government, and the Iranian Foreign 
Ministry--as represented by Foreign Minister Velayati--are all 
extremely eager and interested in restoring peace and 
tranquility in Tajikistan as soon as possible. 
  [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you very much. Let us 
ask a question to Ata Khan Latifi. Mr. Latifi, as the 
representative of the Tajik opposition groups, how hopeful are 
you about these talks and what issues are you going to raise 
during these round of the talks? 
  [Latifi] We shall do our best during these talks to reach a 
conclusion. We took the first step in Moscow. We signed 
several agreements and now we are obliged to take some serious 
steps during these talks. I wish to emphasize that the 
cease-fire should be discussed during the talks. This is one of 
our conditions which we raised in Moscow. We have expanded this 
condition and we will raise it again tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent] Elections are going to be held in Tajikistan 
soon. What is the opinion of the opposition groups on these 
elections? 
  [Latifi] You think about it, how can they hold elections at 
a 
time when a large number of Tajik people are outside their 
country? They have fled the country to live as refugees in 
dozens of countries. They are destitute and helpless. Their 
children have been deprived of schools for the second 
consecutive year. There are a number of refugees in Tajikistan 
itself who keep moving from one city to the next and from one 
village to another. How can elections be organized under such 
circumstances? 
  [Correspondent] As a representative of the opposition, what 
are your expectations from the Tajik Government during these 
talks? 
  [Latifi] I believe at the present we should all feel sorry 
for the people. If we all act with the intention of serving the 
future of our republic, we shall reach a conclusion. 
  [Ballon] My plan is to succeed, but it is up to the Tajik 
sides to decide a way. 
  [Announcer] UN envoy at the Tajik peace talks, Mr. Ballon, 
stressed that the warring factions in Tajikistan have now 
realized that the only way of resolving the Tajik crisis is 
through talks. He added: Despite the existing difficulties in 
the talks, I am optimistic about the outcome of these talks in 
Tehran. He praised the role played by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Russia, and Tajikistan's other neighbors in the peace 
talks.

  [Text] We continue to update you with the situation on the 
Tajikistan border. This is what our correspondent Valentin 
Nikulin has told us: 
  [Nikulin] The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remains 
complicated. Almost daily the Russian border guards have to 
repel provocations from armed detachments of the Tajik 
opposition which is based in the northern provinces of 
Afghanistan. The leaders of the opposition, aware of the large 
military potential of the border guards, as well as of the 
15,000-strong contingent of peace-keeping forces that have 
arrived to support them, have resorted to the very wily tactics 
of silent infiltration across the border by small, well-armed, 
and trained groups instead of a massive spring-summer offensive. 
Their aim is to set up bases and arms depots on the territory 
of Tajikistan, as well as to carry out acts of sabotage. 
  The movements of the bands and formations are under the 
close 
observation of the Tajik special services. As a result of a 
recent three-days operation carried out jointly with the Russian 
border guards, about 30 transgressors were destroyed, a 
Pakistani military advisor among them. A depot containing 200 
nonguided missiles and antiaircraft guns was destroyed, as well 
as a lot of other arms. 
  A dozen attempts to violate the almost 1,200km-long border 
have been foiled. In particular, in one of the sectors of the 
border in the Pamir mountains, border guards' fire stopped 25 
armed transgressors from illegally crossing the border. By the 
way, 10 of them were of Arab origin, according to military 
intelligence. This fact proves once more that the claim of the 
Tajik opposition leaders that no foreign mercenaries are taking 
part in their fight against the present regime in Tajikistan is 
false. 
  And one more scandalous fact from life on the border which 
was related to us at a press conference by Lieutenant-General 
Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of a group of Russian Federation 
border troops. On 8 June an explosive device was discovered and 
deactivated here by a Russian border guards detachment. It had 
been placed by unknown persons on a barge that transported 
refugees returning home from Afghanistan. The resolute and 
skillful actions of the border guards averted the death of 242 
persons, mainly women and children. A day later, at 0610 on 9 
June, the 11th outpost of the Moscow border guards detachment 
suffered concentrated shelling from the territory of 
Afghanistan. Twenty-six missiles were fired directly at it over 
a short period of time. As a result of this action one 
serviceman of the Tajikistan Defense Ministry was killed, and 
another was wounded. Both of them were serving in a subunit of 
the republican Defense Ministry, which was sent to reinforce 
border security.

  [Text] Dushanbe 20 June TASS -- Russia border guards foiled 
an attempt at an armed penetration of the territory of 
Tajikistan from Afghanistan by a small group of Tajik opposition 
in Shuroabad border sector guarded by the Moskovskiy Border 
Detachment on the night from Sunday to Monday.

area, 
forcing the intruders to withdraw to the contiguous bank. Foe 
losses are unknown. There were no losses among Russian 
servicemen, military sources in Dushanbe told ITAR-TASS. 
  In all, over the past 48 hours, border guards thwarted six

  [Excerpts] The second round of inter-Tajik talks opened in 
the Iranian capital 18 June. The delegation representing the 
Dushanbe Government is headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, minister of 
labor and employment, and the opposition is led by Otakhon 
Latifi, Khudaiberdi Khaliknazarov, and others. 
  The opening ceremony of the second round of talks was held 
in 
the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' political research 
center and it was attended by Ramiro Piriz Ballon [the UN 
secretary-general's envoy to Tajikistan] and observers from 
Russia, Iran, Pakistan, (?Afghanistan), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
and Uzbekistan. From Russia, roving Ambassador Aleksandr Oblov 
and Sergey Tretyakov, Russian ambassador in Iran, are taking 
part in the talks. 
  Speeches by Piriz Ballon, Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, and the heads of the Tajik delegations indicate that 
the main objective of the second round of the talks is to sign a 
cease-fire agreement. 
  Having positively assessed the results of the first round of 
talks in Moscow, the UN secretary-general's envoy said that the 
agenda for [the second round of] talks was agreed during talks 
[in Moscow] and a joint commission was formed on the issue of 
refugees. He highly assessed the efforts of Russia and 
observers from other countries and at the same time expressed 
concern at the upsurge of hostilities including an increase in 
terrorist attacks against Russian military personnel in 
Tajikistan. 
  Piriz Ballon said that despite all these, serious 
disagreements exist between the representative of the Tajik 
Government and the opposition. He called on both sides to 
strive for an atmosphere of mutual understanding during the 
talks, to take measures to cease military and other hostile 
operations, and to establish ways of observing future agreements. 
  Piris Ballon assured participants in the talks that the 
United Nations and its secretary general are ready to provide 
aid to assist the normalization of the situation by sending 
experts and providing material aid for the repatriation of 
refugees. 
  Pointing out the great importance of an end to conflict in 
Tajikistan, he said that the establishment of peace in the 
country is the only way to stability and prosperity in the 
Central Asian region. 
  Iran's foreign affairs minister said at the opening ceremony 
of the talks and at the subsequent news conference, that the 
Tajikistan problem cannot be resolved by war. He rejected 
claims that Tehran is exporting its Islamic revolution to 
Tajikistan. 
  Shukurjon Zuhurov and Otakhon Latifi cautiously welcomed the 
talks. However, some of their views show that serious 
disagreements exist [between them] and that it will be difficult 
to overcome them. [passage omitted] 
  The talks are expected to continue for 10 days. Working and 
general meetings will also be held, attended by foreign 
observers. It is also been reported that the third round of 
talks will be held in Islamabad in the middle of July.

  [Text] The first active phase of the operation designed to 
clear the gorges of Garm Region from armed opposition groups was 
concluded on Friday [17 June]. 
  As INTERFAX learned from Tajikistan's Deputy Defence 
Minister, Major-General Aleksandr Chubarov, the operation 
involved army units and troops from the Tajik Security and 
Interior Ministries, who were supported by helicopters and 
armored vehicles. 
  Garm Region lies high in the mountains. Because of its 
complicated terrain it can be dominated by small mobile groups 
of armed men. That is why it is viewed as a bulwark of the 
opposition. 
  As Chubarov said, during the operation 48 men were detained 
in the area of military actions, and handed over to the Security 
Ministry. Some of them were soon set free, since it was proved 
that they had no connection with the opposition. About 30 units 
of firearms, several grenade throwers, a British-made 
transmitter, and a large quantity of ammunition were discovered 
in secret caches hidden in the mountains. A center for training 
opposition militants was destroyed in a locality lying north of 
the village of Hait. 
  Participants in the operation are categorically forbidden to 
use "any types of weapons against population centers," and 
therefore there were no civilian casualties, Chubarov stressed. 
  He does not share the belief that the present confrontation 
in Tajikistan may grow into a long guerrilla warfare. 
  "If we manage to ensure reliable protection for our borders, 
find effective solutions to political issues, including problems 
connected with interaction between the various areas of 
Tajikistan, and conclude the first stage of building our armed 
forces this year, we'll be able to accomplish, together with 
Security and Interior Ministries, the task of preventing the 
opposition from acting on Tajikistan's border and within the 
country," the general said.

  [Text] Nicosia 20 June TASS -- "Turkmenistan is the 
motherland of our ancestors, and the Turkish Republic is the 
second home for our esteemed guests from Turkmenistan. We are 
happy to see the relationship between the two fraternal states 
developed successfully over the past two and a half years," 
Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel said in welcoming President 
Saparmurad Niyazov of Turkmenistan for an official visit to 
Turkey at Ankara international airport on Sunday. 
  President Demirel later said in the presidential palace in 
Ankara that relations between the two countries were developing 
on the basis of equality, non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs, mutual benefit and respect. 
  Cooperation between Turkey and Turkmenistan make an 
important 
contribution to ensuring peace and stability, as well as 
prosperity of all nations of the region, he said. 
  Of course, we want to take our relations to a higher level 
and are displaying a political will necessary to do so. We will 
discuss with Mr. Niyazov a variety of problems, including the 
key issues of international character, the Turkish president 
said. 
  President Demirel expressed the hope that Turkmenistan will 
make ample use of Turkey's experience and potential to overcome 
specific difficulties which arose in the process of its 
development and will soon become a highly developed state. 
Turkey for its part, will render all possible assistance and 
support to the fraternal people.

  [Text] Ashkhabad 19 June TASS -- Turkmen President 
Saparmurad Niyazov leaves for Turkey today for an official 
visit. Summit talks there will take two days, after which he 
will have several days of rest in that country at the invitation 
of Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. 
  A memorandum on cooperation is expected to be signed during 
the visit. It will further develop the already close 
cooperation ties between the two neighbouring countries, which 
believe that they are related to each other by the spirit, 
language, and ethnic origin. 
  This is going to be Niyazov's fourth visit to an Asian 
country over the recent period of time. The first three 
countries he visited were Iran, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
  A new political-geographic zone is being formed in that 
region following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Turkmen 
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who shares Niyazov's 
ideas, told ITAR-TASS. It includes the Indian peninsula, part 
of the Near and Middle East, Central Asia, the Caspian and Black 
Sea basins. According to Shikhmuradov, Turkmenistan's situation 
changed in the new geographic zone. It moved from the outskirts 
of Central Asia to the centre of the new political-geographic 
structure, which focused on it the interest of both Western and 
Asian countries. 
  Taking into account the fact that the natural and manpower 
resources of the region, as well as its scientific and 
technological potential, are truly enormous, the Turkmen 
leadership and its president find it expedient to make use of 
them on the basis of the mechanism of bilateral and multilateral 
systems, without inventing or creating new ones. A series of 
Niyazov's recent visits is in line with that task, Shikhmuradov 
said.

sides have different views regarding the future steps aimed at 
resolving the conflict. He said that the CSCE Minsk Group is 
thinking of continuing its efforts in cooperation with the 
Russian Federation to bring the positions of the conflicting 
sides nearer. 
  The CSCE delegation visited the front lines and the 
prisoners 
of war held in Stepanakert this morning. The talks continued 
between the Minsk Group delegation and NKR leadership in the

Levon Ter-Petrosyan received the chairman of the CSCE Minsk 
group in Yerevan late this evening. During the conversation the 
problems of a peace settlement of the Karabakh conflict were 
discussed. The Armenian position on the matter is unequivocal: 
There is no alternative to peace in the region. But a forced 
confrontation has reached such a level that guarantee of peace 
cannot be achieved without bringing in disengaging forces and 
international observers in the conflict zone. 
  There is practically no contradiction between the Russian 
and 
CSCE peacemaking programs. It is now up to Azerbaijan's good 
will.

  [Text] Yerevan [dateline as received] -- The Presidium of 
Armenian Supreme Council has determined by its resolution "the 
order of partial unpaid privatization of the state enterprise 
property, and their transformation into joint-stock companies". 
According to this document, the property ownership certificate 
shall be granted to the personnel who served for more than one 
year at a particular enterprise. The share of each stock-holder 
is determined in the certificate and depends on the average 
salary, total length of service, and some other factors. 
  Privatization order has been developed by the Armenian 
Government under the law "On Privatization of State Enterprises 
and Unfinished Buildings", according to which 20 percent of 
fixed assets of privatized enterprise may be freely passed to 
its staff. 
  At the same time, a long list of more than 300 enterprises 
was approved by the Presidium, that are not subject to unpaid 
privatization. The list includes, in particular, those Armenian 
state enterprises which function on the territory of other CIS 
countries.

  [Text] In keeping with a prior agreement, a meeting of 
Armenian and Nakhichevan delegations, headed by David 
Shakhnazaryan, the Republic of Armenia president's special envoy 
and chief of the Republic of Armenia state directorate for 
national security, and the chairman of the Nakhichevan Council, 
Namik Gasanov, met on 14 June in the border area of Eraskhevan. 
  Participating in the meeting were the Republic of Armenia 
chief border commissioner Gegam Arutyunyan and representatives 
of military units and executive authority of Ararat and Sadarak 
Rayons. 
  As we were told at the press center of the Republic of 
Armenia Ministry of Defense, the Nakhichevan side once again 
admitted that its military units were at fault in the incident 
that took place on 27 May on the border of Ereskh. 
  With the purpose of averting such border incidents, the 
Armenian delegation proposed to turn the border zone between 
Armenia and Nakhichevan into a zone of trust, and as the first 
practical step in this direction to set up border trade points 
here. 
  The Nakhichevan side promised to present this proposal to 
the 
Azerbaijani leadership for consideration.

  [Text] Baku June 18 TASS -- It is necessary to fully 
coordinate negotiations on Armenian-Azeri settlement, head of 
the CSCE Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh Jan Eliasson said here 
today. 
  Eliasson has returned from Baku upon the completion of 
consultations in Yerevan and Stepanakert and met Azeri President 
Geydar Aliyev tonight. 
  In his opinion, pulled efforts of the sides, the mediating 
missions of CSCE and Russia will help to elaborate a common 
concept of the problem solution. He said that cease-fire in the 
conflict zone has begun an important settlement stage and the 
settlement process should have the right direction. 
  It is also important to prevent a new escalation of combat 
operations. That is why, the persons who are responsible for 
further developments should estimate their chance correctly and 
reach certain compromises in order to settle the conflict 
peacefully and through political negotiations, said Eliasson. 
  The most correct way towards peace is gradual solution of 
problems that have piled up over the conflict years. Each stage 
should be connected with another in a single link, he noted. 
Such a constructive approach will ensure the withdrawal of 
Armenian troops from Azeri lands, return of refugees to places 
of their permanent residence and security guarantees for 
Karabakh Armenians, which is considered the most important in 
the settlement by each side, said Eliasson.

  [Text] Baku [Dateline as received]--Geydar Aliyev, 
President of Azerbaijan, signed on June 15 a Decree on 
"Strengthening the social protection of the population and 
stabilization of the financial situation in the economy". 
  According to this decree, the rate of the minimal wage is 
increased from June 1 up to 2 thousand manats, pensions of those 
not working and scholarships -- 1.5 thousand manats. The rate 
of compensations for each child under 16 years from families 
with an income less than 4 thousand manats will be 750 manats. 
  The government is entrusted with suspending the building of 
objects on account of the budget funds, beside those to be 
finished this year, cancelling all its previous decisions on 
privileged crediting of state enterprises, passing to the system 
of money compensation to socially low-protected residents 
instead of the system of privileged taxation of physical and 
juridical persons. 
  Since June 16 the price of petrol AI-92 has increased from 
17 
to 100 manats per liter, and the price on bread -- from 20 to 80 
manats. In May the minimal consumer's basket made up 30 
thousand manats and the average wage -- 8.3 thousand manats, the

Luchaninov of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Press 
Center, from the "KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondents and News 
Agencies Report" roundup: "Commander's Reconnaissance Under 
Way"] 
  [Text] Abkhazia -- Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General 
Georgiy Kondratyev has issued a statement for the press. 
  The arrival at Gudauta Airfield of military-transport 
aviation aircraft does not signify the beginning of a 
peacekeeping operation by the Russian Armed Forces in the zone 
of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. This operation can only begin 
after ratification by the Federation Council of the edict by the 
Russian president. The arrival in Gudauta of a signal center 
and combat-engineer battalion was proposed as a preparatory 
stage for the introduction of peacekeeping forces. Their main 
task is to clear the area of mines and to establish 
communications with the command posts. As Colonel General G. 
Kondratyev stated at the meeting with journalists, the 
introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the zone 
separating the warring sides may only be effected after the 
adoption by parliament's upper house of the relevant decision. 
  Subunits from the 345th Airborne Regiment stationed in 
Gudauta will not take part in peacekeeping operations. Russia's 
deputy defense minister expressed the hope that a political 
decision by the supreme legislative bodies will facilitate the 
establishment of peace on this land.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibiadze by </F>
unidentified correspondent at the Gonio training ground in 
Batumi on 17 June, where a joint Georgian-Russian military 
exercise took place -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Nadibaidze] The most important thing is that the 
first step was made today toward cooperation with the Russian 
Army. All deputy defense ministers and many brigade commanders 
took part in this large training session [zanyatiye] of the 
Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. It was a very 
useful and well-prepared session, and there was a lot to see and 
learn there. It displayed many aspects of the soldier's life. 
  We brought our brigade commanders with us here. We, I mean 
Georgian Army officers, have never been involved to such an 
extent in sessions like that. This is the most important thing 
about today's session. [Words indistinct] before we left for 
Batumi, I gave them an assignment to introduce such training 
into the Georgian Army. Before the end of the year we plan to 
hold a similar training session involving the 11th Brigade. We 
are now forming a model brigade with battalion personnel 
[sentence as heard]. As I said, we are planning to hold a 
similar session by the end of the year and invite our Russian 
friends to it, as they did today. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Nadibaidze, the Defense 
Ministry issued a statement yesterday [16 June] saying that 
following the Supreme Council session, the transfer of Russian 
troops to Gali Rayon was delayed. 
  [Nadibaidze] There was no delay. As planned, sapper groups 
are now being formed. We will be represented by Colonel 
Kalandadze, the head of the Defense Ministry's engineer service. 
Preparatory measures to be taken ahead of the deployment of 
troops are being implemented on a full scale and according to 
plan. There was no delay and there will not be any delay in the 
future. Everything will develop as planned in advance. All 
tasks discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev during 
his visit to Georgia are being implemented stage by stage. On 
the 19th or 20th June all troops will be in the region.

<F P=106> [Maia Toradze article: "Nationalists, Stand to Attention! </F>
Or the Nationalist Party Has Been Created in Georgia" -- words

  [Excerpts] Reason: "Up to now, not one of the 
parties in existence has been able to create such a society 
where each Georgian is able to harness his potential to the 
maximum for the well-being of the nation." 
  Aim: "To ensure the permanent existence of the 
nation." 
  Mission: "To guide the efforts of the Georgian 
nation toward great aims." 
  Naturally, there is nothing bad in the fact that one more 
party has been formed but why, after all, a nationalist party? 
  Zaza Vashaqmadze, chairman of the Georgian Nationalist 
Party: "Nationalist means the same as national and our 
direct aim proceeds from this. The essence of our activities is 
to place national consciousness above everything else! If we do 
not elevate our own national [awareness], nothing will save 
Georgia." [passage omitted] 
  Whether we like it or not, one more party -- the Georgian 
Nationalist Party -- has been created in Georgia. In the main, 
it unites young people aged between 18 and 30, students, 
lawyers, and economists. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the Congress of Delegates from the Georgian </F>
Workers Communist Party, the Union of Georgian Communists, the 
`Stalin' Political Organization, and the `Remembrance of Stalin' 
International Organization"] 
  [Text] Proceeding from the generally recognized acute 
crisis situation into which the Republic of Georgia and its 
peoples have been plunged; 
  -- recognizing the real danger of the further fragmentation 
of Georgia as a result of the ethnic crisis that has been 
provoked and accompanied by bloodshed; 
  -- predicting still greater confrontation in society, the 
final collapse of the economy, the seizure, plundering, and 
destruction of the remains of property belonging to the state 
and to collective farms and cooperatives, a growth in the crime 
wave, and other unbearable social conditions that can endanger 
the very existence of the state; 
  -- concurring in our views regarding the strategy and 
tactics 
for bringing Georgia out of the political, economic, social, and 
ethnic crisis, 
  the congress resolves: 
  1. To view (constitute) the present gathering of delegates 
from the Georgian Workers Communist Party [GWCP], the "Stalin" 
political organization, the Union of Georgian Communists [UGC], 
and the "Remembrance of Stalin" international organization as a 
congress and the 425 delegates as congress delegates. 
  2. The present congress establishes the Unified Communist 
Party of Georgia [UCPG] that includes the Georgian Workers 
Communist Party, the "Stalin" political organization, the Union 
of Georgian Communists, and members of the "Remembrance of 
Stalin" international organization. 
  The rules of the Georgian Communist Party that were 
published 
in KOMUNISTI No. 1 of 19 March 1994 are to viewed as the rules 
of the UPCG until this party holds its congress. 
  3. A political council is to be formed to prepare and hold 
the regular congress and direct the activities of the UCPG. It 
is to be composed of the following 23 people: P. Georgadze, D. 
Lomashvili, D. Kevlishvili, I. Khazaradze, G. Leiashvili, D. 
Gaganidze, D. Glunchadze, R. Chkhaidze, T. Pipiya, Z. 
Lelashvili, V. Makharadze, S. Rigvava, K. Gardapkhadze, M. 
Chachukashvili, D. Kiknadze, K. Kuliyev, F. Makharadze, V. 
Dolidze, G. Oniani, I. Pantskhava, A. Tsereteli, N. Zakariadze, 
K. Ukleba. 
  In the event of there being an urgent necessity to include 
new members, the Political Council is provided with the right of 
co- option. 
  4. The congress declares the UCPG to be the successor to the 
Georgian Communist Party that existed until 26 August 1991. 
  5. Once the UCPG has been registered, the parties that have 
joined it (GWCP, UGC, and the "Stalin" political organization) 
will be liquidated in accordance with their rules. 
  6. The congress informs those parties and social 
organizations that adhere to socialist ideas that the UCPG is 
ready to receive them into its ranks. 
  The Political Council is empowered to conduct conciliatory 
talks with the representatives of any parties and social 
organizations that wish to defend the interests of Georgia's 
workers through joint efforts. 
  7. The congress approves the activities of the editorial 
board of the GWCP organ KOMUNISTI and considers it necessary to 
assist it in every way (including materially). The constituent 
congress confirms KOMUNISTI, the newspaper of the GWCP, a party 
that has made a big contribution to the creation of the UCPG, to 
be its press organ. 
  8. The congress recommends that primary, rayon, town, and 
oblast party organizations unite their efforts, strengthen the 
unified ranks of party organizations, and, at regular meetings 
(conferences), elect single delegates for the forthcoming 
congress according to the norm that will be established later. 
  9. The congress, understanding all the complexities of 
settling the Abkhazian problem, views as acceptable the 
agreement on a cease- fire and the separation of forces signed 
in Moscow on 11 May 1994 by representatives from Georgia and 
Abkhazia in the presence of [representatives from] the UN, 
Russian Federation, and CSCE.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 18, BNS -- A meeting of Estonia's 
rightist forces yesterday in the south Estonian town of Voru 
adopted the statutes of the Parem-Eesti (Rightist Estonia or 
Better Estonia) national alliance. Juri Estam, head of the 
Estonian Association of Owners by Law and a well-known 
television personality, was unanimously elected chairman of the 
organization. 
  Parem-Eesti unites right-of-center parties and organizations 
that intend to go to the next parliamentary election on a 
coalition platform. Under the statutes, former members of the 
Communist Party and employees of repressive organs like the KGB 
cannot belong to the leading bodies of the alliance or run in 
election on its ticket. 
  The eight-member board of Parem-Eesti includes, besides 
Estam, representatives from the Estonian National Progress 
Party, the Estonian National Party, and four other rightist 
groups and associations.

  [Text] Three-way negotiations between representatives of 
the Estonian government, employers and employees ended with the 
signing of a protocol which establishes a minimum hourly wage 
effective as of Aug. 1. 
  Economics Minister Toivo Jurgenson said the wage was set at 
2.65 kroons. As Viljar Veskivali, the chairman of the Estonian 
Industry Association, said, this means that, beginning with 
August, employers must pay not less than 2.65 kroons for an 
hour's work. 
  Veskivali said the negotiating parties agreed in principle 
that pensions must not be tied to the minimum hourly wage. 
  The parties also agreed that the unemployment benefit must 
be 
smaller than the official subsistence level, which at present 
stands at 280 kroons per month, Jurgenson said. 
  "We must give maximum encouragement to working," the 
minister 
said. "But we didn't as yet get down to concrete sums in 
connection with unemployment benefits." 
  Veskivali said the signed protocol stipulates that the 
government must reach agreement with employers and employees on 
legislation raising the tax burden before sending it for 
consideration in the parliament. Also, the government cannot 
under the agreement unilaterally put up the price of electric 
energy.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>
  [Text] Riga June 19 TASS -- A possibility of the 
dismantling of two unfinished buildings in Skrunda, where it was 
planned to locate a new reception and transmission centre of the 
radar station, is being discussed by American and Latvian 
specialists. On Monday they will be joined by Swedish 
specialists, and consultations will continue until June 22. 
  Latvia wishes to start the dismantling of the complex as 
soon 
as possible. Its construction was started in 1976 and stopped 
in 1990. Production forms and records for those two buildings, 
which have a height of seven and 18 floors, have already been 
turned over to Latvia, as envisaged by bilateral agreements, 
signed in Moscow on April 30. The Latvian Government announced 
a contest among firms. It is going to place the order with the 
firm which undertakes to dismantle the buildings quicker than 
others with minimal expenditures. Americans promised to finance 
the project. It is not clear, however, how much money will be 
needed and in exactly what way the buildings will be dismantled. 
The problem is being discussed with the participation of 
officials from the U.S. Department of Defence. 
  The agreements signed in the Kremlin have not yet been 
ratified by parliaments of the two countries. Latvian Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs was asked: "If the legislators do not 
support the agreements, how will it affect the dismantling 
process?" He said that the facility already belonged to 
Latvia, irrespective of the future of the treaty. Under the 
agreements, the old radar will function for another four years.

  [Text] Today the negotiations between Latvian experts and 
the representatives of the U.S. State Department and Defense 
Department started in Riga. The main topic of the negotiations 
is the [passage indistinct] which the American Government is 
going to sign for the dismantling of one of the former Russian 
military objects in Skrunda in western Latvia. This object is a 
part of the Russian radar base, which according to the 
Latvian-Russian interstate agreements on troop withdrawal, is to 
be operated by Russia for another four years. 
  The interstate agreement says that Latvia must dismantle the 
most recently built part of the station and transform it into a 
civilian object. This part of the radar station has not been 
completed by the Russian side. According to the agreement, 
dismantling or rebuilding of the new part of the Skrunda radar 
carried out by the Latvian side must not disturb the work of the 
Russian-operated part of the station in any way. The Latvian 
side also holds material responsibility in case the building or 
dismantling work harms the functioning part of the radar station 
or its staff. 
  The delegation of the Latvian experts for the talks is 
headed 
by [passage indistinct] who is the responsible government 
official for agreements on the judicial status of Skrunda radar 
during its temporary operation in the period of dismantling. 
Today the financial and economical, as well as technical 
aspects were discussed. Tomorrow the American experts are 
scheduled to visit the radar station. On Monday a number of 
American and Swedish experts are scheduled to arrive in Riga to 
continue the consultations. The talks will end next Wednesday.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 18, BNS -- The Latvian National 
Independence Movement's (LNIM) delegates of the movement's 7th

As many as 223 of the congress delegates voted for this 
decision, 12 voted against it, and 6 delegates abstained from 
voting. As many as 270 delegates participate in the congress. 
  The LNIM board's head, Aristids Lambergs, said that, since

themselves again if they want to become members of the newly 
formed political party. 
  LNIM Saeima [parliament] faction's Head Aleksandrs Kirsteins

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 524 ] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, June 17, ELTA -- Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius and the new Ministers Vladislavas Domarkas, Albertas 
Vasiliauskas, Bronius Bradauskas and Aleksandras Vasiliauskas 
held a news conference on Friday morning. 
  Yesterday Seimas [parliament] considered the interpellation 
to the government. The results of the voting were as follows: 
65 members were confident in the government, 51 -- expressed 
the non- confidence in it. The government managed to survive. 
  Slezevicius said that half a hundred votes for the 
non-confidence did not surprised him at all. He promised to 
take into consideration all critical remarks when drawing up a 
new program. The program will deal with the privatization, tax 
control, improvements in the work of customs-offices and 
investments. 
  Asked about the rumours about the litas devaluation, 
Slezevicius said that this was a kind of intimidation of the 
population. Meanwhile there were no prerequisites to devalue the 
national currency. 
  "Our main purpose is to withdraw investment cheques from the 
circulation in order to make the privatization function in 
compliance with the economic laws," Economics Minister 
Aleksandras Vasiliauskas said. 
  Environmental Minister Bronius Bradauskas said that the 
environmental protection was impossible without the firm 
economic footing, thus, the new ministry would see the 
strengthening of economic, legal and ecological education 
services. 
  According to Educational Minister Vladislavas Domarkas, his 
major purpose was to achieve the consideration of education as a 
priority. 
  Forestry Minister Albertas Vasiliauskas noted that his 
ministry had been unfairly accused of abuse of its power by the 
press and a number of deputies. Thus, his purpose was to 
restore the good name of the ministry.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 0710 GMT on 18 June, on the "How Shall We Live" 
program, broadcasts live a 45-minute question-and-answer session 
with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk answering viewers' 
questions from a studio in Kiev linked up with a studio in 
Moscow. 
  Asked why he wants to stay in power, Kravchuk replies: 
"There are many reasons. The first and most important is the 
fact that over the last two and a half years, Ukraine has made 
very important and very serious steps toward forming its own 
statehood and reorientating the economy toward the market and 
reforms. Over these years, Ukraine has become a state in full 
measure and has been recognized by the world community. 
  "Obviously, I am not trying to take credit for all these 
achievements; I realize these have been achieved by the people 
and all the power structures. In spite of all the criticisms, 
they have made very important steps in this direction. 
Therefore, I would like to see that everything that has been 
planned and implemented, all the foundations that have been 
laid, should develop and be consolidated. This is one of the 
most important reasons." 
  In reply to criticism that during recent years, life in the 
Republic has deteriorated, Kravchuk said: "Yes, the material 
life has not improved for the majority of the people, and for a 
considerable part it has even deteriorated. I can explain this. 
Such a major transition from one system to another, such major 
changes in society, the change in economic and politic systems 
certainly involves major consequences, and people can feel this 
for themselves; this is inevitable. Neither Ukraine nor other 
states are an exception here." 
  Asked whether he, as the president, has created the 
necessary 
conditions for implementing the reforms, Kravchuk says: "The 
conditions were created. It is another matter that it was not 
easy to find educated and professional people in the situation 
that evolved -- I mean, we started the reforms with the 
personnel potential of the past. Attempts to introduce new 
people into the government -- there were such attempts in the 
Fokin and Kuchma governments, but to my great regret and 
sadness, the people who joined the government with good 
intentions to step up the reforms failed to implement them." 
  Kravchuk is asked whether he regards himself as a 
nationalist. He replies: "I am very often asked this question 
here in Ukraine. Some call me a nationalist, while others call 
me a betrayer of national interests; in other words, there is 
one point of view on the left and another on the right." He 
continues: "My reply will be brief: I have defended and will 
defend the interests of the people of Ukraine, the national 
interests, because there can be no other interests than state 
interests, integrity, and the independence of Ukraine and its 
statehood. This is my sacred duty." 
  To the accusations that the disruption of economic ties has 
done a great deal of damage to common people, Kravchuk agrees 
that politicians are to blame for this. He says: "I will be 
honest with you. I am ready to sign a document on free trade 
with Russia tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and I have 
proposed this repeatedly. But let us be consistent. There 
should be no exceptions to free trade. In other words, Ukraine 
should not make exceptions and Russia should not make 
exceptions, if we are talking about free trade where goods move 
freely. But Russia says it would not be beneficial to subject 
its oil, gas, and nonferrous metals to the sphere of the free 
movement of goods -- on the whole, more than 60 different goods 
that earn Russia's revenue. In such a case, Ukrainian 
manufacturers would have to buy oil and gas for twice as much as 
do Russian manufacturers. How can they compete with Russian 
manufacturers? They cannot. Therefore, I agree with you: The 
political leadership is to blame for this, but both political 
leaderships, not only Ukraine's; one should not reduce this to 
saying that we are the ones pursuing some special policy." 
  Asked about national ideology, Kravchuk says: "We are not 
dividing people according to their nationality either in the 
economic, political, legal, or any other aspect." He adds: "We 
are building a civil society and all our ideology is based on 
this. We know and firmly believe that to build a state in a 
multinational country on the basis of nationality would be 
dangerous for the development of this state. This would be 
grounds for possible contradictions today and tomorrow." 
  Touching upon Crimea and federalism, Kravchuk says: 
"Evidently, it is not easy at present to find a clear-cut and 
correct solution." He adds: "I am advocating and will advocate 
the most decisive economic sovereignty of the regions; in other 
words, the widest and fullest rights and freedoms as regards the 
budget, the formation of the budget from below, and the 
utilization of resources and protection of people's interests 
taking into account the peculiarities of a particular region." 
  To the accusation that Ukraine has isolated itself from 
Russia, Kravchuk replies: "I cannot agree that we have isolated 
ourselves. Only recently, apart from signing the treaty on 
friendship and cooperation with Russia, we have signed more than 
70 different political, economic, and other documents." He 
adds: "It was not Ukraine who started erecting borders, but 
Russia -- one can check the documents. It is not Ukraine who 
stands firmly at a customs post today and says that customs 
duties are necessary."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey </F>
Krasnoshchekov and Konstantin Pribytkov] 
  [Text] Crans Montana, Switzerland 18 June TASS -- One can 
have an absolutely tranquil vacation in the Crimea. It is the 
best resort place in the former Soviet Union, Crimean President 
Yuriy Meshkov told an exclusive ITAR-TASS interview on Friday 
[17 June] in the Swiss mountain resort of Crans-Montana. The 
president is attending an international forum on East-West 
cooperation. 
  "There is no need to worry, and this is not because I am 
optimistic by nature, but because the reality proves premature 
character of rumors claiming aggravated situation in the 
Crimea," he said. 
  Commenting on the Simferopol-Kiev relations, the president 
said that the "stage of unilateral pressure and force methods 
has ceased to exist." The tension can be removed through 
negotiations following the example of Russia and Tatarstan. The 
current situation is "not a confrontation but the necessary 
elucidation of relations," said Yuriy Meshkov. Further dialogue 
will help to reach accord to ensure certainty and stability. 
  If Russia influences the situation rather actively, things 
will normalize for both Ukraine, the Crimea and Russia, stressed 
the Crimean leader. As for the Crimean-Russian relations, the 
bilateral trade and economic agreements, including the agreement 
with the Moscow government, shall be filled in with content. 
"This opens up great prospects, and it is up to us not to miss 
them," he added. 
  Asked what Russia shall do now, the president said it 
"should 
use all of its possibilities and finally satisfy its state 
interest." Solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem would, 
certainly, help the stabilization but, unfortunately, there are 
attempts to settle the problem without the Crimean 
participation, noted Meshkov. 
  "The Black Sea Fleet can and must be located on our 
territory. The Crimea does not and will not have problems with 
the Black Sea Fleet," said the Crimean leader.

  [Text] The criteria for cooperation between NATO and the 
Ukrainian Navy would not be discussed before the Black Sea Fleet 
is divided between Ukraine and Russia, General Antonio Milani, 
deputy commander of the NATO southern flank, told journalists in 
Sevastopol where he arrived at the invitation of the Ukrainian 
armed force command. 
  He met with Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander 
of the Ukrainian Navy, in the city. 
  Milani said that his visit to Sevastopol had nothing to do 
with the tense situation there and that his party would not meet 
with the Crimean leadership. 
  He emphasized that Ukraine was a sovereign state which had 
to 
tackle its domestic problems on its own. 
  Following his meeting with Milani, Bezkorovaynyy told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine that his country badly needed cooperation with 
NATO in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program 
which, he thought, marked the start of reorienting military and 
political blocks to the maintenance of peace. 
  Bezkorovaynyy said that cooperation between the Ukrainian 
armed forces and NATO and planning of joint activities at the 
initial stage had been discussed in the framework of the program. 
  He added that exchange of experts who would concentrate on 
specific issues in interaction between the Ukrainian Navy and 
NATO had been discussed at the meeting.

  [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council, has spoken out against the division of the Black Sea 
Fleet. At a meeting with the Crimean Supreme Council deputies he 
proposed that the Black Sea Fleet should not be regarded as an 
object to be divided. 
  According to Moroz, the Black Sea Fleet should be used 
jointly by Ukraine and Russia with the fleet remaining under a 
unified joint command, and with Russia giving orders to one part 
of the fleet and Ukraine to the other. There must be separate 
commands for parts the parts, but a joint command as well, so 
that the fleet should not be demolished as a fighting unit. The 
Black Sea is a special interest zone for Ukraine and Russia.

  [Text] A delegation from Ukraine's Supreme Council has left 
for Bucharest. It will take part in the work of the third 
session of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary 
Assembly. Before departing, [Oleksandr Tkachenko,] the head of 
the delegation and first deputy chairman of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council, was interviewed. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] How do you see the role of 
the assembly in improving our mutual relations, both in economic 
and political life, with the countries which have already joined 
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Parliamentary Assembly? 
  [Tkachenko] I think that the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
Parliamentary Assembly has set itself (?three tasks): [First] 
improving the political situation in the Black Sea region; 
second, the establishment of economic mutual relations and 
economic mutual assistance [words indistinct] creating its own 
bank, on which fruitful work [words indistinct]; and the third 
thing is undoubtedly our cooperation on issues of scientific and 
technical (?progress). 
  I believe that our trip to the third session of the assembly 
sets a number of cardinal tasks, especially on issues of 
economic cooperation between our states, which have joined this 
assembly. The main issue [words indistinct] is undoubtedly 
security in this region, and the second issue is elaboration of 
economic mutual relations and the creation of a single financial 
bank. 
  [Correspondent] Will Ukraine be proposing such a package of 
documents. 
  [Tkachenko] Undoubtedly we will be proposing our documents, 
well, within the program of the agenda which was planned for 
this meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev -- The press service of Ukraine's Ministry of 
Defense has reported that on 16 June, Army General Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of defense, visited Elsworth 
Airbase (in South Dakota) during his official visit to the 
United States. He viewed the missile launch silo of a strategic 
ballistic missile, which had been prepared for elimination and 
destruction in the presence of the head of the Ukrainian 
military department. Vitaliy Radetskyy evaluated this step as a 
manifestation of confidence in and respect for Ukraine, and also 
as a continuation of mutually beneficial relations between the 
military departments of both countries. 
  On 17 June, Vitaliy Radetskyy met employees of the RAND 
Corporation in Los Angeles. During the conversation he stressed 
that as a guarantee of its national security Ukraine has its own 
armed forces and also its defense industry, which should provide 
the military with armaments and fighting equipment.

  [Text] At their conference in Kiev the Russian and 
Ukrainian Unions of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs adopted a 
joint appeal to their presidents, parliaments and governments, 
expressing grave concern over the continuing destruction of 
economic ties between the two countries. According to the 
authors of the appeal, the reason for this lies in the 
complicated settlements and unjustified customs restrictions 
between Russia and Ukraine, which lead to stopping, completely 
or partially, work at the plants and factories producing 
consumer goods and the essential types of industrial products. 
  The industrialists and entrepreneurs urged the leaders of 
their countries to create appropriate conditions for economic 
integration between Russia and Ukraine and dismantle all the 
barriers artificially put on the road of cooperation. In their 
view the first steps in this direction could be to open 
affiliations of Ukrainian banks in Russia and Russian in 
Ukraine, establish preferential regime in bilateral trade, lift 
the demand for advance payments and set up joint industrial and 
financial groups. 
  The appeal was signed by the leaders of the Russian and 
Ukrainian Unions of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkady 
Volsky and Leonid Kuchma. Kuchma is a candidate for 
presidential elections in Ukraine planned for 26 June.

  [Text] [Announcer Marchenko] Elements of the Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry's special forces arrived in Simferopol last 
night. Aleksey Tkach, deputy head of the Republic's Interior 
Ministry explained the aim of the deployment for our radio 
station. 
  [Begin Tkach recording] Yes, it is true that such an outfit 
was deployed. They are special forces from the 21st special 
detachment. The aim of their transfer is, generally speaking, 
the situation that has emerged in connection with the fact that 
the Crimean golden eagles [berkuty] are not carrying out their 
duties. Around a third of the Crimean golden eagles are busy 
guarding [Crimean President] Meshkov and [Crimean Interior 
Minister] Kuznetsov himself. They are not looking after public 
order. [end recording] 
  [Marchenko] We asked the Crimean interior minister, Valeriy 
Kuznetsov, to comment on this statement by the Ukrainian 
Interior Ministry. 
  [Begin Kuznetsov recording] There is no slacking. The 
Interior Ministry of the Crimean Republic is fulfilling its 
obligations. I will tell you one thing: They [Ukraine] are 
doing everything in their power now to dissolve the Interior 
Ministry of the Crimean Republic, which is against the 
Constitution of the Crimean Republic and even Ukraine's law on 
delegating powers. They are breaking a lot of the laws of both 
Ukraine and Crimea. [end recording]

  [Text] Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin's 
remark -- that he refused to enrol Sevastopol Naval Institute 
graduates in the fleet because of the poor quality of their 
training -- has not gone unremarked by the press center of the 
Ukrainian Navy. The press center's statement in this connection 
stresses that the level of knowledge, demonstrated by the first 
group of the institute's officer graduates in the course of 
working for their diplomas, was high. Three of them were 
awarded both lieutenants' shoulder straps and golden medals, and 
another 29 received higher educational institution graduation 
diplomas with honors. 
  Vice Admiral Mykola Klitnyy, state commission chairman and 
ex-chief of staff of the Black Sea Fleet, said that the quality 
of education at the institute has traditionally been high. In 
the two years that have passed since the reorganization of naval 
schools into the institute, the skills and professional 
knowledge of the professors and lecturers have not been lost. 
  It is hard to add anything to Klitnyy's words. It is only 
possible to point out that the institute's Ukrainian status 
causes Black Sea Fleet officials to react in certain way, the 
press center's statement says. It is planned, incidentally, 
that 57 of the institute's graduates will serve in the Russian 
Navy.

  [Text] Kharkov, [no date as received] -- As a UNIAN 
correspondent learned, on 16 June an attempt was made on the 
life of Oleksiy Stelmakh, age 28, a people's deputy candidate of 
the city council, Constituency No. 70, and editor of the 
independent city newspaper V KAZHDYY DOM [TO EVERY HOUSE] with 
the largest circulation in the city. A stranger accosted him at 
the entrance to the editorial office and hit him several times

bodily injuries. The stranger disappeared. 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent Oleksiy Stelmakh

chances of winning in the constituency were extremely high. 
  Criminal proceedings have been instituted in connection with 
this attack.

  [Text] Kharkov -- At a news conference for local 
journalists on 16 June, Leonid Kuchma, a candidate for president 
of Ukraine, expressed the opinion that Ukrainian society is 
continuing to live under socialism, that the state is to be 
found on the brink of a national catastrophe, 
deindustrialization of the country is occurring, it is being 
turned into a raw materials appendage, and it is sliding toward 
an African path of development. 
  In the event of his election as president, Leonid Kuchma 
considers his most important steps to be resolving issues of 
taxation policy, the revocation of a fixed currency exchange 
rate, getting banking, credit, and financial activity going, and 
resolving the non-payments problem. In Kuchma's opinion, one 
should conduct forced small privatization and return currency 
from abroad. The candidate for the post of president believes 
that land and all means of production should become goods in 
future, but if one were to declare land to be goods now, one 
could end up with nothing. 
  Once again Leonid Kuchma expressed himself against the 
election of a prime minister before the presidential election, 
and noted that although he considers Vitaliy Masol to be an 
experienced individual, Masol's present views are not known, and 
on the whole he considers "all of this" to be "a dangerous game." 
  At the news conference, Leonid Kuchma renounced some of the 
assertions he made during his previous meeting with 
representatives of the nonstate sector of the economy.

  [Text] Kharkov [no dateline as received] -- While in the 
oblast on 17 June, Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian 
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a candidate for 
president of Ukraine, expressed himself critically regarding the 
Supreme Council having elected Vitaliy Masol as the new prime 
minister. He is convinced that this does not demonstrate the 
recognition of this person's authority, but is a manifestation 
of ordinary political games on the eve of the presidential 
election. "If Ukraine's voters elect someone other than Leonid 
Kravchuk or Oleksandr Moroz as president on 26 June, Leonid 
Kuchma stressed, then cooperation between the prime minister and 
the president will be fairly problematical." 
  Leonid Kuchma did not rule out that the last week in the 
presidential marathon will bring much that is unexpected. In 
particular, in his opinion, contenders for the presidential seat 
will withdraw their candidacies. If Oleksandr Moroz does this, 
Leonid Kuchma expressed the hope that his [Moroz's] electorate 
will vote for Leonid Kuchma. In the opinion of Leonid 
Danylovych Kuchma, the forces supporting him in Ukraine's east 
and south should influence changes to the existing state of 
affairs more actively, when in fact western Ukraine is dictating 
its conditions to the whole of the 50 million-strong country. 
  Leonid Kuchma maintained: "If I am not elected, this will 
not 
be a great tragedy for me. On the whole, I am returning to 
politics only in order to save Ukraine. Otherwise, I would not 
risk going into the corridors of power."

<F P=106> [News conference by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman </F>
Oleksandr Moroz by unidentified correspondents on 11 June; place 
not given; edited by Svitlana Pysarenko: "I Stand for 
Protection of Social Achievements"] 
  [Text] On 11 June, Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman 
Oleksandr Moroz met with journalists, as a candidate for the 
Ukrainian president. But before answering journalists' 
questions, the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman reported on 
the future activities of the parliament. In particular, this 
relates to the introduction of changes and amendments to the Law 
on Local Councils and Self-Government, aimed at defining equal 
subordination of council chairmen, as well as the need to more 
accurately define the electoral procedures and counting of votes 
to select the winners. 
  It has been planned to focus the future work of the 
parliament on economic issues. Parliament will hear a report by 
the Cabinet of Ministers on the current situation, in order to 
reduce risk and simultaneously define the starting point for the 
new authorities. Oleksandr Moroz is to deliver a report on the 
problems of stabilizing the economic situation, and to define 
the main directions for parliament action. Only following that, 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will submit to the Supreme 
Council for approval the candidate for prime minister, whose 
plan for action would be able to confirm all decisions by the 
Supreme Council. All this is being done, Oleksandr Moroz noted, 
so that both legislative and executive authorities bear 
responsibility for the coordination of actions of the Supreme 
Council and the Cabinet of Ministers. Oleksandr Moroz also 
voiced his support for amplifying functions and broadening the 
powers of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Of course, there were tricky questions and smart answers as 
well. Here is the quintessence. Read and judge for yourself: 
  [Correspondent] If the Cabinet of Ministers and the prime 
minister obtained broader executive powers than its current 
ones, this would mean taking them away from the president. What 
functions, in your opinion, should the head of state have? 
  [Moroz] He should represent Ukraine so that it does not lose 
its image before the world community as a member of 
international organizations, in issues concerning nuclear 
weapons, or trade relations. The president must defend 
Ukraine's image. Regarding internal affairs, the president is 
not able to concentrate on executive functions, he must hand 
them over to the Cabinet of Ministers. Yet, the president 
should be a guarantor of the Constitution, he should prevent any 
violations. 
  [Correspondent] Currently, there is an opinion that it is 
inexpedient to form a government before electing the president. 
What is your standpoint on this issue? 
  [Moroz] The point is not to form the government, but to 
appoint the prime minister. No one can be sure that the 
president will be elected. 
  [Correspondent] But there is a constitutional provision 
saying the new president presents the candidate for prime 
minister. 
  [Moroz] No. It has been written in the Constitution that 
the president presents the prime minister. If the Supreme 
Council approves him in three days from now, it will do the same 
in three weeks. 
  [Correspondent] You are not campaigning much for yourself. 
Perhaps you need to meet with company staffs more often? Is it 
important for you to participate in the presidential campaign? 
  [Moroz] My main task was to begin the Supreme Council's 
work. When I was in the hospital, I was actively campaigning for 
myself among the medical personnel. In general, I could put it 
this way: "I am not asking you to vote for me, but for the man 
you trust. I am not seeking power, but my goal is to become the 
president." I will be holding meetings with staffs. 
  [Correspondent] It has been rumored that if you do not 
become the president, you will begin a battle against the 
presidency. Is that so? 
  [Moroz] No. The main point is to find within society the 
optimum correlations between powers and functions of different 
authorities. In Germany, for instance, all this was done, I 
would say, in an intelligent manner. I would also like us to 
define everything in an optimum way, so that hair does not stand 
on end on heads of people supporting the division of power.... 
  [Correspondent] In which office do you think you would feel 
better -- that of Supreme Council chairman, or president? 
  [Moroz] I cannot say which role is better: I became the 
chairman quite recently, and I have not yet worked as the 
president. Therefore, I will answer this question later. 
  [Correspondent] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said 
that he would hold consultations concerning the candidacy for 
prime minister. Has this taken place, and has the candidacy 
been approved? 
  [Moroz] Yes. Leonid Kravchuk attended the Supreme Council 
session. Six names were discussed, and we agreed on two of 
them. But since the president is to name them, I will not do it. 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider it necessary that a 
presidential candidate submit his income declaration? 
  [Moroz] Of course, this is a norm of the law, and I have 
complied with it. As a matter of fact, my declaration has not 
stunned anybody. 
  [Correspondent] If this is not a secret, what is your 
salary? 
  [Moroz] I have not yet received it, but it approximately 
amounts to 2-2.5 million [currency not specified]. 
  [Correspondent] President Kravchuk has recently said that he 
does not see poorly dressed or hungry people in Ukraine... 
  [Moroz] There is nothing strange about this if someone stays 
among well-dressed and well-fed people. 
  However, a theater actress lives in my building. Her pension 
is not enough to make ends meet. I help her with food that I 
grow on my countryside farm. It is difficult for her to receive 
such help, and it is also difficult for me that I must help her 
in such a way. 
  [Correspondent] If Kravchuk and Kuchma advance to the 
second round of elections, for whom will you vote? 
  [Moroz] I will tell you that after 26 June, when they 
advance to the second round. 
  [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, will be the results 
of the 24 July elections for Ukrainian people's deputies in 112 
constituencies? 
  [Moroz] I believe that the current proportions among forces 
in the Supreme Council will be preserved. However, deputies 
will not be elected everywhere. Perhaps we will have around 
60-70 people elected. 
  [Correspondent] You have four grandchildren. Have you 
already built, for example, a cottage for them? 
  [Moroz] I feel shameful that I have not done anything like 
that for them. I recall when I was removing couch-grass from my 
farm, I told to myself that socialism can be built together, but 
a cottage just alone. 
  [Correspondent] Deputies are supposed to put into shape 
their working relations with the Supreme Council. How will they 
provide for themselves, will their salary be raised? 
  [Moroz] Cheap deputies may cost the state a lot. Their 
current salary amounts to 1.3-1.5 million [currency not 
specified]. One must take it into account that there is no 
housing for them in Kiev, they live in hotels. Their families 
live separately, which means additional expenses. Perhaps, 
considering all this, deputies' salaries will be raised. But, 
we will publish everything to avoid speculations. In general, 
prices must be brought in line with wages, because the 
artificially suppressed inflation will explode anyway. 
  [Correspondent] There is a talk that legislation depriving 
deputies of immunity is already being drafted in parliament. 
  [Moroz] According to the Law on Deputy Status, a deputy is 
an immune person. If a deputy violates the law, however, he 
must be accountable not as a deputy, but as a citizen. All 
citizens are equal before the law. 
  [Correspondent] Do you need your own team of people, and 
according to what principle do you select them? 
  [Moroz] I need a team, and the principle is the ability to 
objectively assess processes. Based on my experience as 
Socialist Party leader, where we have different people, very 
different, and where I have probably lost more health than in 
any other work, I know that discrepancies in opinions are not 
important to me, but causes are. 
  [Correspondent] Would it not be more expedient for 
parliament to elect the president? 
  [Moroz] These elections must be held according to current 
legislation. In general, I think that it would be better to 
elect the president not in direct elections, but by, for 
example, a congress of councils of all levels, which would have 
a higher level of legitimacy. This congress of councils of all 
levels, not the parliament, could also adopt amendments to the 
Constitution. The Constitution would then be protected. In 
general, one must first adopt an amendment to the Constitution, 
and then an appropriate law, not to the contrary, as was the 
case before. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the state should assist 
the press, which is currently in a very difficult situation? 
  [Moroz] Attacks on the press began as early as 1986 in the 
Soviet Union, and due to inertia, it still continues. But, it 
is the reader who must be protected, so that subscription fees 
for a publication he needs do not ruin his family budget. 
Currently, many people do not subscribe to anything, because 
their wages do not allow for that. I believe that not 
publications, but the Communication Ministry must be subsidized, 
and then all publications will have equal conditions before the 
readers. 
  [Correspondent] What periodic publications do you like? 
  [Moroz] I like those I can read without glasses. But 
speaking seriously, I like all of them, there are different 
things in different newspapers. There are papers that publish 
some things I already know. This is not interesting. 
Currently, I flip through approximately 15 publications, most 
of all those dealing with politics and authorities, reviews, and 
commentaries. 
  [Correspondent] Have you read the latest stories concerning 
Kravchuk? 
  [Moroz] About Kravchuk? I know more about him than the 
authors of those stories. I do not read them. Rada Havrylivna, 
Shcherbytskyy's [former first secretary of the Ukrainian SSR 
Communist Party] wife, has presented me with a book about him. 
I started to read it, and I understood that the author based 
his position on Shcherbytskyy's. I put the book aside. Perhaps 
I will read it one day. 
  [Correspondent] You once said that no political force is 
putting pressure on you. What if one does, how will you react? 
  [Moroz] Adequately. I understand what you are trying to 
say: Apparently, the communists are putting pressure on me. So 
are other forces. In general, there is no majority in 
parliament, and I will do everything to maintain this situation. 
I believe that my goal is to consolidate all forces. 
  [Correspondent] Do you personally make decisions, or is 
common opinion a stimulus for you? 
  [Moroz] There are various approaches. When I see that 
someone's proposal has more merit, I support it. As a rule, 
however, the majority of people do not accept progressive 
decisions, at least, not immediately. So one must convince 
them. I am accused of having dangerous intentions, for example, 
in my program. My positions are criticized, but when I ask 
which ones in particular, my accusers cannot answer, because 
they have not read my program. They say that I am an enemy of 
Ukraine, of the state and the people. These allegations are 
groundless. I stand for the protection of our social 
achievements: the guaranteed rights to work, education, health 
care, and cultural development. History must not be distorted, 
this will do no good. We were celebrating the 50th anniversary 
of setting up the second front, and we had even forgotten to 
invite members of the anti-Nazi coalition. Events are being 
seen in a different light now, even though there are no grounds 
for that to be the case. 
  [Correspondent] Are you going to visit the Crimea? 
  [Moroz] Yes. But before that, I want to do some preliminary 
work. Besides, the Crimean problem is not as acute as it is 
being portrayed by certain media. Regarding the Crimea, the 
main thing is to prevent the use of force. All problems must be 
resolved in a political manner.

  [Text] Ten days before the presidential election in 
Ukraine, the former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma is heading the 
list of candidates. According to opinion polls, 31 percent of 
respondents support him. Some 20 percent of Ukrainian citizens 
are ready to support the current president, Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Here is another report indirectly connected with the 
Ukrainian election. The "Person of the Week" program from the 
Vid company under Ostankino TV, which was scheduled for tonight, 
has been taken off the air. It was to have profiled Leonid 
Kuchma. Our radio station has found out that the broadcast was 
cancelled by Gennadiy Shipitko, deputy chairman of the Ostankino 
company responsible for political and information matters.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 115 (605): </F>
Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has given his backing to 
the economic program of Ukraine's new Prime Minister Vitaliy 
Masol and expressed his hope that it will be implemented. 
Addressing students and teachers of the Odessa Polytechnical 
Institute, Kravchuk underlined that "the main thing is that 
nobody hinders him." 
  According to Kravchuk, Masol meets all demands of the 
parliament and the Ukrainian society which they put forward with 
respect to the head of the government. "Masol has re-oriented 
both in his ideology and in his perception of the Ukrainian 
economy and the program proclaimed by him in the parliament 
testifies to this fact," Kravchuk said. 
  At the parliament's session Masol declared that he is in 
favor of introduction of several changes into Ukraine's 
Constitution, which would stipulate that the prime minister is 
the head of the executive power and carries personal 
responsibility in for the economic transformations in the 
country in the face of the people. 
  "The crisis is not over yet, it is deepening and we are 
probably on the threshold of a burst," he said. However, he 
reassured the deputies that "the government would do its utmost 
to stabilize the situation" but this will begin "not earlier 
than in a year or in a year and a half." 
  Masol called his election to the post of the head of the 
Cabinet "a chance for those who want to work." "The future 
Cabinet of Ministers, he continued, will consist of like minded 
professionals who stand on the market platform and are outside 
any political orientations. Ukraine's national interests will 
be their major goal," Masol stressed. 
  He addressed to Ukraine's political forces and people with a 
request "to abstain from destructive moves." 
  The parliament has proposed to the premier to present a plan 
of urgent measures to stabilize the social-economic situation in 
the country to the parliament for consideration and to make 
necessary changes in the composition of the cabinet. 
  After Masol's election the parliament speaker Aleksandr 
Moroz 
declared to journalists that substantial changes would take 
place in the government. In his words, "the Cabinet will be 
primarily formed on the professional basis but not in accordance 
with political points of views." 
  Deputy Yefim Zvyagilsky, former acting premier, gave a 
positive assessment to Masol's election because "he knows Masol 
as a professional, an experienced industrialist." 
  Deputy Petr Simonenko, leader of Ukraine's Communist Party, 
said that the new head of the government "as well as we, the 
communists," understands the problems of the Ukrainian people." 
"We have several differences but they are not principal ones 
and will not prevent our work," he added. 
  At the same time leader of the Popular Rukh Vyacheslav 
Chernovil believes that "the government headed by Masol will go 
along the way of reforms too slowly." In his opinion, "Masol 
would not have been elected" if the voting had not been 
postponed for Thursday morning but was held the previous 
evening. Chernovil asserts that "an active work to buy over the 
deputies was being conducted" at night from 15 to 16 June. 
  Leader of the Ukrainian conservative republican party Stepan 
Khmara called the premier's elections held before creation of a 
necessary legislative basis, in particular, before the adoption 
of the decree on the government as premature.

  [Text] Today, Leonid Kravchuk was on the election trail in 
Odessa. 
  [Correspondent Sergey Barabanov] Ten days are left before 
the 
Ukrainian presidential elections. Observers note a significant 
growth in the popularity of the current President Leonid 
Kravchuk. During his one-day visit to Odessa today, he paid most 
attention to the economy problem, but also dwelt in some detail 
on the prospects for the political integration of CIS countries. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] Yes, the time will come, yes, 
there will be integration, yes, there may be political elements 
in the integration. But if this is begun today, then it would 
strain the situation to the limit -- both in Russia and outside 
Russia. I think that certain gentlemen are making haste in 
putting forward new formulas today. We have to use the 
potential of the CIS. [end recording] 
  [Barabanov] As is well-known, Kravchuk's main opponent, 
Leonid Kuchma, holds a different opinion on that point. What 
the people of Ukraine think we will find out on 26 June.

  [Text] Chernobyl, [No dateline as received] -- During the 
night of 16-17 June the trans-shipment of the exhausted nuclear 
fuel from the basin of the second power unit at the Chernobyl 
nuclear power station -- caused by an increased water leakage 
spotted by the station's personnel on 7 June -- was completed. 
This was reported to Ukraine's Ministry of the Environment, the 
State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, and the State 
Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Safety. 
  "The leakage in the basin had been registered for a long 
period of time," Viktor Vasylchenko, chief engineer of the 
"CHAES" production association said during his conversation with 
a UNIAN correspondent. "Besides, the operation of the second 
power unit is now being discontinued. The standard systems 
diverted the leakages to the capacities, specially designed for 
this purpose. There was no aggravation of the radiation 
situation on the territory of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
station and, moreover, there was no contamination of the 
environment, as certain mass media assumed, and there could be 
none -- the situation is fully under control." 
  According to Vasylchenko, a periodic servicing of the 
exhausted nuclear fuel decay basin, envisaged in such cases, got 
under way on 17 June.

  [Text] If a former USSR republic is ready to set up a 
confederation or even a union, Russia will unequivocally support 
it, the Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev declared at a session of 
the Council on Foreign Policy in Moscow Thursday. 
  In his opinion, the idea suggested by Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev to set up a Eurasian alliance "should focus 
on current CIS integration difficulties rather than distract 
attention from them." 
  He said it was good that the process of separation in the 
former USSR proceeded peacefully. "Fortunately, Russia had 
enough strength to avoid confrontation and bloodshed. Now, it 
is necessary to advance towards setting up a real commonwealth 
rather than a neutral community, a commonwealth where all its 
members be respected as sovereign and independent republics," he 
said. 
  Speaking about Russia's peace-keeping efforts in CIS states, 
Kozyrev regretted the absence of appropriate legislation for 
that. 
  "Regrettably, our new parliament has no time for such 
legislation. It finds it more exciting to discuss North Korea's 
nuclear program. The impression is that our members of 
parliament work on the principle that our chief concern is that 
there should not be another Pol Pot," Kozyrev said. 
  He voiced puzzlement at the fact that the Federation Council 
is not ready to sanction a Russian peace-keeping operation in 
Abkhazia. "Whenever there is a vacuum, it is always filled. If 
not Russia, some other country will come to that region, and 
that will hardly be in Russia's interests," Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>
  [Text] Brussels June 17 TASS -- Russia's Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev will sign the framework document 
of the Partnership for Peace programme in NATO's headquarters in 
Brussels on June 22, an official spokesman for the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation announced today. 
  Sources in NATO headquarters and the Russian Embassy told 
ITAR- TASS that negotiations will be held here on Saturday 
between the NATO chief's political adviser Gebhardt von Moltke 
and Russian officials to specify the programme of the Russian 
foreign minister's visit. 
  On Wednesday, the North Atlantic Council called on Russia to 
hold a discussion of its relations with the alliance in 
pursuance of the accords reached at the meeting of the NATO 
foreign ministers and their East European partners in Istanbul 
on June 9 and 10. 
  At the Istanbul conference, the North Atlantic alliance 
welcomed Russia's intention to join without any preconditions 
the programme of cooperation for East European and former Soviet 
countries proposed by the leaders of the NATO member-countries 
in January. The NATO ministers at the same time agreed to "a 
broader dialogue" with Russia with due account of its size and 
weight in international affairs and its nuclear status. 
  Over the past six months, the question about Russia's 
special 
relationship with NATO was in the centre of talks about Moscow's 
membership of this programme which provides for cooperation in 
military planning and training, joint exercises and interaction 
in peacekeeping and rescue operations. 
  Russia proposed a formal announcement of its special status 
and asked for NATO's pledge to hold mandatory consultations with 
Russia before making important political decisions. The 
alliance which recognizes Russia's role, sought to put a deeper 
dialogue with Moscow on "a more informal basis." 
  As concerns the framework agreement, Brussels position is 
firm: it is one and the same for all partners and gives all of 
them equal access to cooperation with the alliance. 
  The framework agreement will be signed by Russia in the same 
form as it was signed by 20 partner-countries, including states 
of the former Warsaw treaty and the former Soviet Union, 
ITAR-TASS learned in NATO headquarters. 
  It is possible that two other documents will be agreed, 
although it is not yet clear what name the first one will be 
given: it may be a statement, a declaration or a protocol of the 
meeting between the Russian minister and members of the North 
Atlantic Council. NATO expects Russia to put on the table a 
presentation document which contains proposals for cooperation 
and is submitted by every partner. 
  Andrey Kozyrev is due to meet first of all NATO Deputy 
Secretary- General Sergio Balanzino (Secretary-General Manfred 
Woerner is away for treatment). He will then attend a meeting 
of the North Atlantic Council to sign the framework agreement. 
NATO sources did not rule out the possibility of changes to the 
habitual procedure. One of them is that the council meeting 
will be attended not only by permanent envoys but also by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and probably some other 
foreign ministers who will arrive in Brussels for the occasion. 
  A day before the signing, Andrey Kozyrev is due to hold a 
meeting with Warren Christopher to discuss key international 
issues, including the tension on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Brussels June 18 TASS -- Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Vitaliy Churkin and Deputy NATO Secretary-General for 
Political Issues Gebhardt von Moltke voiced progress in the 
establishment of new relations between Moscow and NATO on 
Saturday. 
  After negotiations at the NATO Brussels headquarters, Von 
Moltke told correspondents that the Russian-NATO cooperation is 
on a good path. In his turn, Churkin added that the 
negotiations on a broad range of issues were useful. Neither of 
them specified what progress has been achieved. 
  In the words of Von Moltke, permanent representatives of 
NATO 
member-state in the rank of ambassadors will study the results 
of his negotiations with Churkin on Monday, and Churkin will 
hold consultations with his government. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is expected to sign 
a 
framework document of the NATO Partnership for Peace program on 
Monday. It is so far unclear whether the sides will adopt a 
bilateral document which, in the opinion of Russia, should 
provide for a broader political dialogue between Russia and NATO 
with due account of the Russian scale, the role in international 
affairs and the nuclear status. 
  NATO recognizes the Russian right to special attitude but 
wants to hold this broader dialogue on the informal basis 
outside the partnership program that is equal for all.

  [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- "Russia and Germany are 
currently going through the process of renewal, which, despite 
many differences, have much in common. In particular, this 
concerns Eastern Germany, which offers broad opportunities for 
cooperation and interaction," said visiting Chairman of the 
Russian State Duma, Ivan Rybkin, addressing representatives of 
the Berlin parliamentary assembly in the "Charlottenburg" Castle 
in Berlin on Sunday. 
  Rybkin expressed his gratitude for the warm and friendly 
welcome given to the Russian delegation, saying that "during the 
period of uneasy economic transformations in Russia cooperation 
with Germany is of great importance." 
  Deputy chairman of the Berlin assembly of lawmakers, 
Reinhard 
Fuerer, said that Germany regards the visit by the Russian 
delegation as a contribution to the development of existing 
contacts and the beginning of new contacts between the two 
countries at a parliamentary level. "Tremendous changes are 
taking place both in Russia and in Germany. The Russian 
Federation has achieved considerable progress on the way to 
democracy. This is worthy of praise even more, taking into 
account a complex process of reforms in the country's economy 
which, at times, poses serious problems to the population. 
However, these problems and additional hardships should not be 
used as a pretext for going back on the process of 
democratisation," the deputy chairman of the Berlin assembly 
said. 
  He pointed out that Russia should take a firm place in free 
europe. "Russia is doing so by taking an active part in U.N. 
peace- keeping actions. Such efforts arouse respect all over 
the world, the German lawmaker said. 
  The chairman of the Russia State Duma made an entry in 
Berlin's "gold book".

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "The Duma </F>
Had No Time To Protect the Constitution. Everybody Reacts 
Differently to the Presidential Edict"] 
  [Text] The criminal world does not seem to pay any 
attention to the presidential edict on combating it. Since the 
edict was promulgated, shooting on Moscow streets and explosions 
in cars and banks have continued very much as usual. 
Incidentally, especially suspicious are those explosions which, 
from the point of view of terrorists, end with practically no 
result. It is not ruled out that what really matters is not the 
indifference of criminal clans to the paper issued by the 
guarantor of the Constitution, but that this seeming 
indifference allows the authorities, primarily in Moscow, to 
start translating the edicts' provisions into life. 
  According to some reports, the unabating activity by 
criminal 
groups can be used as a reason for the Internal Affairs Ministry 
to ask the army for assistance, backing this request by a 
corresponding presidential order. As became known, the 
metropolitan authorities, who have already increased the number 
of police equipped with automatic weapons on city streets, are 
planning to enlist army units that proved themselves back in 
October. True, assistance from the army is not an easy thing so 
far, and this must be why rumors have been spreading recently 
that troops will be seen in the city only after the hand of the 
criminal world has been raised not against a businessman but a 
politician, not necessarily a prominent, high-profile one, but 
sufficiently known, primarily to the president. 
  Unlike organized crime, the State Duma noticed the edict. 
Yesterday the legislation and security committees moved a draft 
resolution titled "On Protecting the Citizens' Constitutional 
Rights and Freedoms in Enforcing Crime Control Measures". The 
document notes that Edict 12/26 is in direct contradiction to 
Articles 4, 10, 17, 19, 22, 34, 50, and 55 of the Constitution 
as well as a whole number of articles of the Criminal Law Code 
now in force. The administration of justice system is thereby 
disrupted, the resolution stresses, proposing to reaffirm the 
fact that the Constitution and federal laws are supreme while 
human rights and freedoms may not be limited by any subordinate 
enactments. Therefore, the Supreme Court, in considering 
corresponding cases, must be guided by the Constitution and 
laws, the Duma believes. The resolution tasks its committees 
with speeding up the drafting and presentation of legislative 
enactments on crime control and the law on the Constitutional 
Court. The Duma recommends to the president to suspend his 
edict and bring it into line with the current laws. 
  Having bogged down in amendments to the corruption law, 
however, the deputies failed to discuss and adopt the resolution 
and therefore defend the Constitution as they had planned.

  [Text] State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin welcomes Boris 
Yeltsin's decree on urgent measures to protect the population 
from banditry and other organized crimes as a vitally important 
act. He told journalists on Saturday evening that many 
countries had resorted to similar or even tougher measures. As 
an example, he referred to the program proposed by Roosevelt, 
which allowed the U.S. to pull itself out of the Depression and 
fight crime. 
  He noted, however, that if Yeltsin had submitted a draft law 
on amending and enlarging Russia's Criminal Code a day before 
the decree was passed, there would not have been any friction 
between the president and the State Duma. 
  He said that although a decree implies immediate 
implementation, the Criminal Code might also be amended very 
quickly.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kucherenko under the "Power and Money" </F>
rubric: "Warrant for Moscow. A Subjective View of the 
Activities of the Capital's Mayor"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Luzhkov has been a leitmotif of recent days. 
He has announced that he will now oppose the course of the 
present government. For more than six months now he has been a 
fierce opponent of Chubays' privatization. He is said to be 
aiming for the post of president of the Russian Federation. 
<H5>  Nothing for Nothing? </H5>
  Luzhkov's first thesis: It is necessary to sell property at 
a realistic price and so replenish the budget in order to carry 
out social and housing programs. He propagandizes this thesis 
at every opportunity. But how does he fulfill it himself? 
  First of all, let us note that Chubays has never been able 
to 
"spread himself" in the capital. Since the middle of 1991 
privatization here has been proceeding in a special way: 
Yeltsin himself gave Moscow's mayor these powers in two edicts. 
The mayor of Moscow has become the virtual ruler of the 
destinies of the land, the buildings, the budgetary money, and 
the so-called nonbudgetary funds. No organ elected by the 
residents of "most democratic" Moscow controls him. Neither the 
Mossovet [Moscow City Soviet], which at first was reduced to the 
position of an "architectural excess" on the edifice of power in 
the capital and was then destroyed, nor the City Duma, which 
sits there meek as a lamb, has managed this. 
  Thus, few people prevented Mr. Luzhkov from obtaining 
trillions from the capital's property in both 1992 and 1993. 
What happened? 
  In 1992 the Mossovet raised a scandal: City Hall had planned 
that the city's budget would get just 2.24 billion rubles [R] 
from privatization! Just approximately $20 million at the then 
prevailing rate of exchange, despite the fact that the rent for 
one square meter of office space in the city ranged from $600 to 
$1,200 a year! 
  Sergey Pykhtin, former member of the inner soviet, recalls 
that literally a few days before Luzhkov announced the figure of 
R2.24 billion, the press carried a report that the proceeds from 
just four projects sold by City Hall had totaled R6 billion. 
  There was no scandal over the 1993 budget, since the 
Mossovet 
had been destroyed. But there was a debate in the summer of 
1993. It turned out that City Hall had planned to secure R9 
billion -- just approximately $9 million at the rate of exchange 
at the time -- by leasing premises to privatized enterprises. 
So the mayor's words about trillions of rubles, or billions of 
dollars, somehow are not confirmed by the figures. 
  The mayor undoubtedly sells some things for money -- all 
sorts of stores and warehouses. But let us take the fate of the 
capital's tastiest property morsels -- hotels, CPSU property, 
and plots of land in central districts. Have they brought many 
billions to ordinary Muscovites? For all these are such 
attractive things to business, on which business would not 
grudge forking out huge sums of money. Just put this property 
up for auction. But things happened differently. 
  Let us take an example: The Central Stadium at Luzhniki. 
  On 22 July 1992 Directive No. 1801-RP of the premier of the 
government of Moscow (Luzhkov is both mayor and premier 
simultaneously) exempted the stadium from profits tax and ground 
rent. On 23 July Directive No. 222-RM "On Privatization of the 
V.I. Lenin Central Stadium" set the charter fund of that project 
at...R98 million, which at that time was equal to the value of 
49 passenger cars or 25-30 apartments. Finally, on 11 September 
1992 Document No. 337-RM organized an industrial goods market on 
the stadium's territory. 
  Thus, a narrow group of people ("Luzhniki-Invest") obtained 
a 
huge piece of territory and finished structures, which they had 
not erected, in a prestigious district practically free of 
charge. At the same time the city budget would not get a single 
kopek, for the mayor had exempted the new venture from taxes and 
payments! 
  I could also cite the by now axiomatic example of the way 60 
hectares in the region of Gagarin Square were leased for 99 
years to the "KNIT-Kaluzhskaya Zastava" Joint Venture for $10 a 
year. The city administration said about this: The low ground 
rent will prompt investors to invest money in the construction 
of a grandiose complex of buildings. But, in selling 
enterprises very cheaply, Chubays' people say of the same thing: 
Investors should not give money to the state but invest it in 
production. 
<H5>  Incidentally, About the "Party's Gold..." </H5>
  I would like to ask the mayor what happened to the property 
of the Moscow CPSU City Committee [Gorkom] and Oblast Committee, 
the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] complex, and 
the USSR Council of Ministers Administration of Affairs, which 
Moscow City Hall inherited after August 1991. In which 
newspapers did it publish the list of these projects and 
announce a competition for their sale and privatization? 
Finally, how much money was allocated, at the same time, to 
social and housing programs? 
  Moscow CPSU Gorkom had seven buildings right in the center 
of 
the city, a facilities department with the "Litvinovo" Health 
Camp, and a transport section with a garage and 900 employees -- 
really a readymade top-class cab fleet. (The list is taken from 
Luzhkov's Directive No. 238-RVM of 6 September 1991). The CEMA 
complex (which became first the residence of City Hall and then 
that of the State Duma) included the Mir Hotel and restaurant, 
an underground garage, a motor vehicle base, a printing plant, a 
kindergarten, and a guest house. In addition to the 29-story 
skyscraper itself, luxurious party housing also fell into City 
Hall's hands after that August. 
  File entry: "...Last week's event was the sale by auction of 
apartments in a block which belonged to the CPSU Central 
Committee through the `Orgkomitet' Joint-Stock Company. It is 
an interesting fact...that the right to sell these apartments 
was granted to `Orgkomitet' without any competition being held. 
Observers are inclined to put this down to a coincidence of 
interests between the leaders of the Moscow government and the 
joint-stock company...." 
  "On the day of the auction Mitichkin (president of the 
joint-stock company -- V.K.) declared that he still did not know 
what percentage his firm would receive from the apartment 
sales.... This attests that `Orgkomitet's' leadership is able 
to resolve this problem with the Moscow government calmly and 
without problems" -- KOMMERSANT 2 March 1992. 
  It is worth recalling that this joint-stock company was 
founded by the Moscow government (20 percent of the shares), 
while none other than Luzhkov became its president. At the same 
time it is not clear from the charter documents whether this was 
as a representative of a legal person or as a private citizen. 
It is also noteworthy that by his decision of 19 February 1991 
he ordered that a proportion of the city administration's 
profits from "Orgkomitet" be channeled not into the city's 
budget but into increasing...the charter fund of "Orgkomitet" 
itself. But what about social and housing programs for ordinary 
Muscovites? 
  All right, the "Central Committee apartments" were put on 
open sale. But what about the rest of the party's legacy? We 
can use one example to show what benefit the ordinary Muscovite 
derived from this "privatization." 
  The transport section of Moscow CPSU Gorkom became City 
Hall's motor vehicle fleet. Whereas previously the poor Soviet 
Union had paid for partyocrats to travel in black Volgas, now 
the residents of City Hall rode around in the same vehicles. In 
November 1991 Yuriy Mikhaylovich signed a joint decision with 
the "ASM-Holding" Joint-Stock Company, under which the latter 
pledged to supply City Hall's motor vehicle fleet with 150 
passenger cars a year, while City Hall promised "ASM..." "to 
give it all possible assistance in allocating premises and 
paying for leased buildings...." So much for social and housing 
programs. 
  Privatization of the capital's land and real estate is 
something special. City Hall selected in an unknown way five 
firms to organize auctions for the sale of plots and buildings. 
It is a mystery who selected these firms and on what criteria. 
The competitions which they held were not very well publicized 
either. 
  Of course, an ordinary person with labor savings has nothing 
to do in such auctions -- these are businessmen's games. But 
they were not very pleased about them. At the end of 1992 
Borovoy, who was then still at odds with Luzhkov, sorrowfully 
said: We lodge applications for such auctions, but we never 
succeed. Buildings are sold to goodness knows who for a few 
million rubles and a week or two later are resold for a quarter 
of a billion. 
  The second thesis advanced by the mayor, who has now gone 
over to the opposition, is that anarchy reigns in Russia, with 
the result that the country is being taken apart and sold off on 
the cheap. If there is no power, not a single law or sensible 
measure will work. 
  Luzhkov has been in charge of Moscow since 1990. At first de 
facto, but then de jure. He has had more than enough time to 
instill order. But what do we see? Let us open MOSKOVSKIYE 
NOVOSTI for 5 September 1993 and learn that Luzhkov's government 
is the founder of 178 joint ventures, to which 61 industrial 
projects, 450 hectares of extremely expensive city land, and 
buildings with an area of 220,000 square meters have been 
transferred. The newspaper provides a detailed report of a 
scandalous session of the city's government: "You might think 
that Moscow can count on sizable receipts into its treasury from 
these firms. But according to the data of the External 
Relations Department, the city's revenue from the activities of 
joint ventures is less than the funds invested in them. For 
some reason just two-thirds were registered at the tax 
inspectorate in 1992. Only 37 percent of them paid taxes to the 
city in full. The budget has a constant shortfall in profits 
from operating city property, including currency profits.... 
The mayor believes that it is necessary to analyze the work of 
all ventures.... But nobody has made such a detailed analysis. 
Moscow has no record of the activities of joint ventures. It 
is not known today what specifically each firm does, how 
successfully it does it, what use it makes of city property.... 
Back in April of last year (1992 -- V.K.) it (the government -- 
V.K.) entrusted the Moscow Committee for the Management of State 
Property with creating a data bank of joint ventures. Still 
nothing has been done (i.e. 18 months later -- V.K.). But it 
will be extremely difficult for the government to reclaim its 
share from the 'guilty parties.' The mechanism for confiscating 
city property from joint ventures has not been worked out even 
theoretically." 
<H5>  The City as "Milch Cow" </H5>
  We can cite another example. The "Perestroyka" Joint 
Venture, in which the city had a 40-percent participation 
through the "Mosinzhstroy" municipal structure. Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich extolled Stroyev, the head of "Perestroyka," as a 
real businessman. What next? In the spring of 1993 Stroyev hid 
from Russian investigators in the United States, the 
"Mosinzhbeton" Combine was left without the $1.5 million owed it 
by the joint venture, and "Mosinzhstroy" was seeking its 
legitimate share of the profits. It turned out that rich 
foreign firms had been transferring the rent for "Perestroyka's" 
offices to an account not at a Moscow bank but a Cypriot bank. 
At the same time the joint venture easily obtained from Luzhkov 
both land in Moscow and buildings. But Cyprus.... This island 
is a place of registration for offshore firms and an 
international tax haven. 
<H5>  Market and Owners Moscow-Style </H5>
  Yuriy Mikhaylovich has almost autocratic control over the 
city's budget. The tax inspectorate is also subordinate to him. 
But, even so, the mayor of Russia's richest city constantly 
demands money from the federal budget, as though Moscow were 
some loss-making collective farm! 
  During the life of the Mossovet the city budget served as a 
constant subject of scandals. In December 1992 deputies forced 
City Hall to admit that there was a shortfall of R40 billion in 
the revenue part. In general, fiery passions were raging then 
-- this is a subject for a separate article. It is sufficient 
just to say that Luzhkov's financial department was unable even 
to state definitely how many taxpayers there are in the city or 
why there is a discrepancy of tens of times between its 
indicators and the Moscow City Statistical Administration's 
data. City Hall and the government of Moscow, both headed by 
Luzhkov, were mortally offended by the Mossovet's suppositions 
that the "missing" billions serve as magnificent soil for 
corruption and embezzlement of public funds. They attempted to 
end relations with the Mossovet altogether. 
  By the middle of 1993 another scandal had broken over the 
city's budget, and the Mossovet entrusted its chairman with 
lodging documents with the Prosecutor's Office. But the bloody 
crisis arose, and the mayor once again found himself "in the 
saddle." 
  Here is another recent example. At the end of that year the 
Russian Federation Government cut down the budget investment 
program prepared by the "economic heads" of the Ministry of 
Economics -- Ya. Urinson and S. Vasilyev. It allocated only 
approximately R30 billion to science, culture, and education. 
But R200 billion for the construction in Moscow of the memorial 
on Poklonnaya Hill. If that version had gotten through, Luzhkov 
could have loudly proclaimed his thrift and patrioticness: I 
have found the money for a sacred cause. The rich budget morsel 
wrested from Russian physicians and teachers would have gone to 
the capital's construction monopoly headed by Luzhkov's vice 
premier -- Vladimir Iosifovich Resin. 
<H5>  "Patriotic Market" and "Real Owners" -- the Moscow Version </H5>
  Our mayor's third thesis: Chubays' privatization brings 
forth not real owners but barren speculators in land and 
buildings and foreign rogues who buy up everything on the cheap. 
This, incidentally, is quite likely. 
  But how does the mayor himself put his patriotic principles 
into practice? Let us take another example and trace who in 
Moscow becomes an owner and how the commissions which determine 
the very best are made up. So, the Moskva Hotel is on stage. 
  Last year the competition for the right to manage the hotel 
was won by Germany's Adwanta in conjunction with "Menatep" and 
the Moscow Regional Development Fund [MRDF]. It is significant 
that the firm of "Oyromill," which lost to them, offered terms 
that were far more advantageous to the city. Thus, "Oyromill" 
promised to invest here the profits from the Moskva, while 
Adwanta and company promised to export them. The loser promised 
to recoup the expenditure in six years, and the winner in 15-18 
"winters." [pun on Russian word for year -- leto -- which 
literally means "summer"] "Oyromill" planned to involve our 
specialists in the business and to spend 4 percent of the 
profits on management, while Adwanta planned to spend twice as 
much, with only foreigners on the management. The "also-ran" 
estimated profits at $153 million over 10 years; the competition 
winner at $76 million. At the same time Adwanta, "Menatep," and 
the MRDF did not make any redemption payment at all into the 
city treasury. They became, in fact, virtually the full owners 
of a chic hotel 100 meters from the Kremlin, but the project 
itself formally remained municipal property. Moreover, they 
have made the Moskva into a standard of "anti-Chubaysism." 
  The secret of the win by Adwanta and company becomes clear 
if 
we take a look at the composition of the founders of one of the 
owners of a very tasty morsel -- the MRDF. It is the Moscow 
Construction Committee headed by V. Resin, Luzhkov's deputy, who 
also headed the competition commission for the Moskva. Does it 
turn out that he awarded victory to his own daughter firm? 
  Incidentally, the MRDF's founders include the present 
External Relations Department of the city government headed by 
I. Ordzhonikidze, who, let us note, was deputy chairman of the 
jury on the Moskva. 
  Another member of this commission was the head of the 
Municipal Housing Department, and yet another was Saprykin, 
Luzhkov's subordinate, whose department is coowner of the 
Balchug Hotel along with the firm of Kempinski, which is owned 
by the same Adwanta. Do you require any further comment? 
Particularly with regard to whether the city received any money 
for housing and social programs as a result of that competition. 
  Today it is possible to state that the mayor has turned the 
capital into a holding under his own control, which has 
tenaciously monopolized the city's entire wholesale food trade, 
transport, and construction -- in short, the city's most 
important functions. Is this a market? The mayor maintains 
that 3 million square meters of housing are constructed in 
Moscow every year, one-third of which goes to indigent people on 
the waiting list, with apartments going to those who joined the 
line in 1987 (3.4 million meters), which is in keeping with the 
1955 indicators. This despite the fact that twice as much is 
paid for an apartment in the city as for one in America. Given 
such a demand from businessmen, the capital should experience 
literally a construction boom, and the municipality could give 
investors land for apartment blocks, receiving in exchange 20 
percent of the apartments for people on the waiting list. A 
simple calculation attests that in this way it is possible to 
obtain approximately twice as much free housing. 
  But construction in Moscow has been monopolized by Vice 
Premier Resin, who prefers to construct somewhat less and to 
sell it for somewhat more. Private investors themselves are 
hardly building at all: City Hall demands too large a 
percentage of apartments "in tribute." Therefore housing in the 
city long ago became an unaffordable luxury for nonbusinessmen. 
Moscow is heading pell-mell for the kingdom of "five families 
in one room." 
<H5>  Proprietors of Life </H5>
  The "Orgkomitet" Joint-Stock Company trades in municipal 
housing constructed at the taxpayers' expense and pockets the 
profits. The "MIKS" Joint-Stock Company with the participation 
of the Moscow Construction Committee's main administration 
constructs luxury cottages for nouveaux riches. Businessmen who 
conducted the "Moscow Lights" apartment lottery bought 
apartments not directly from the Municipal Housing Department 
but through some investment center attached to it. At a price, 
moreover, four times higher than the auction price at that time 
(incidentally, the lottery itself failed). Mr. Resin's 
department also participates in the "City" project -- a piece of 
New York in Presnya. 
  Contrary to laws and presidential edicts, Vladimir 
Iosifovich 
Resin himself went about for almost a year as a private person 
-- founder of the firm of "Stroygarant" and owner of 60 percent 
of "Mosinzhstroy's" capital. In August 1992 Resin (as vice 
premier) transferred to this association (and, thus, also to 
himself personally) property, the mere list of which runs to 
hundreds of pages. Without any redemption payments, which the 
mayor so wants to channel into housing and social programs for 
ordinary city folk. Incidentally, in 1992-1993 the enterprises 
belonging to "Mosinzhstroy" transferred to "Stroygarant" 1.5 
percent, only not of the profits but of the volume of work 
fulfilled. Since they had carried it out mainly with official 
money, this constitutes a pump for transferring the people's 
funds to private pockets. If you consider that "Mosinzhstroy" 
has a total monopoly on road, asphalt, and pipelaying work, you 
can understand that the source of pumping is practically 
inexhaustible. 
  As the proprietor of "Mosinzhstroy," "Stroygarant" also owns 
40 percent of the "Perestroyka" Joint Venture, of which we have 
already spoken. 
<H5>  Some Results </H5>
  When it comes right down to it, the system being created by 
Luzhkov -- power and big business in the same pair of hands -- 
is the economic basis of a totalitarian system resembling the 
regimes of the ancient Asian despots, Haiti's "Papa Doc," or the 
Mobutu Sese Seko clique in Zaire. The political superstructure 
is determined by the basis. 
  It is already possible to see features of this 
superstructure 
in Moscow. The more rampant crime becomes, the more 
self-confident thugs are seen in the city's streets in a dappled 
uniform with handcuffs, sticks, and even firearms. Luzhkov has 
gotten control of the Internal Affairs Main Administration and 
municipal militia forces and is now also forming "people's 
militia detachments" subordinate to his government. 
  Last year Luzhkov decided on a simple action: Caucasians 
out, Special-Purpose Militia Detachment members in almost every 
store. All of Moscow's lumpen applauded the mayor, giving no 
thought whatever to the consequences. As though others (even 
from Solntsevo! [town near Moscow -- hangout of mobsters]) would 
not take the place of those driven out and take advantage of the 
same anarchy and venality. Buying officials on the pretext of 
paying for the services of their "pocket" firms. 
<H5>  Politics Is Still a Dirty Business </H5>
  Nevertheless, Luzhkov is becoming a formidable force in 
politics. He relies on a narrow circle of bankers, allowing 
"Most" and several other banks to service the city budget. 
Dealers in real estate, which brings in huge profits, are 
backing the mayor, who has done them a great favor. He makes 
uncontrolled use of the budget and squeezes money out of the 
federal government -- and they give luxury cottages to officers 
of elite Moscow divisions. There is money for Big Politics and 
the Big Press. 
  In the big game for the presidency Yuriy Mikhaylovich is 
starting to speak in the words of those whom he was lambasting 
just a few months ago -- Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. This ploy is 
called "intercepting revolution." The mayor's experts and 
image-makers evidently reckon that the national-state guys are 
the best bet now. Luzhkov has already also been caught out in 
fashionable "Russophilia." The claim that Gaydar and Chubays 
are agents of Russia's enemies is a rhetorical ploy already 
employed by him. Speaking about the jubilee of a celebrated 
satirist, he cited himself with pleasure in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: 
"There is one Russian Luzhkov, the rest are Zhvanetskiys." 
  Let us note in this connection that the mayor is pulling the 
tails of two dangerous animals, which might turn upon him: 
nationalism and armed mercenaries. 
  As the venerable liberal Karl Popper warned in "The Open 
Society and Its Enemies," someone who resorts to the services of 
armed people runs a great risk. For people with guns will soon 
realize that money is secondary. The primary force is the one 
that can be used to secure both power and wealth for yourself.

  [Text] Minsk, 17 June -- On 16 June the car in which 
Aleksandr Lukashenko, presidential candidate and well-known 
campaigner for anticorruption, was shot at after leaving a 
meeting with the electorate. As a BELINFORM correspondent was 
told by Likashenko's spokesman, this happened at midnight near 
the regional center of Liozno in Vitebsk Oblast. Fortunately, 
the bullet from a passing car of foreign make did not hit 
Lukashenko. It just went through the car seat. 
  The shooting was confirmed by the Liozno internal affairs 
directorate. However, no details of the incident have been 
given. 
  Boris Aldanov, Belarusian deputy minister of internal 
affairs, reported that an investigation has begun and said he 
was puzzled why the indicent was reported to the region's 
militia department eight hours after it happened.

  [Text] The information department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of the Republic told a KHOVAR correspondent that 
armed groups of the Islamic Rebirth Party of Tajikistan have 
assembled in the Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan close to the 
residential areas of Darvoz and Shugnan rayons and the Khorog 
city of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast of Tajikistan. 
  Their aim is to cross over to the territory of Tajikistan 
and 
wage armed struggles in the future against the government forces 
and to reach the Khoburabot Pass. Mercenaries from other 
countries are also included in the armed groups. 
  Leadership of the Afghan province of Badakhshan, including 
its military commander Abdol Khalid (Basir), are not doing 
anything to stop the movement and operation of the armed groups 
on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. 
  Explaining the situation, the headquarters of the group of

  [Text] Uzbekistan's Foreign Minister Saydmukhtar 
Saydkasymov said that the Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's proposal of a Eurasian Union is an attempt to 
restore the former USSR. He was speaking in Tashkent on Friday 
[17 June] at a meeting with the heads of the diplomatic corps 
accredited in the Republic. 
  Saydkasymov said the CIS has not exhausted its opportunities 
yet and a Eurasian Union would mean a return to the past. 
"Uzbekistan links its future with the sovereignty obtained by 
the Republic," he said. 
  Kazakhstan's Ambassador to Uzbekistan Nazhameden Iskaliyev 
told INTERFAX that "every state has the right to express its 
opinion on issues in which it has an interest." Iskaliyev 
believes that the idea of an Eurasian Union would be discussed 
at the September summit of the heads of CIS states. 
  "Of course, certain corrections will be introduced into the 
document, nevertheless it should be treated with great 
attention," Iskalilyev said.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] In an exclusive interview with Interfax, the 
military adviser to President Ter-Petrosyan and chief inspector 
of the Armenian armed forces Gurgen Dalibaltayan said that in 
terms of both quantity and quality the Armenian army met the 
technical requirements of the Transcaucasian region. But, he 
said, the armsrace launched by certain countries of that region 
compelled Armenia to work constantly on the technical potential 
of its army. 
  Under the treaty on conventional weapons, Armenia could have 
no more than 220 tanks, 220 other armored vehicles, including 
135 MICV's, 100 combat planes and 50 combat helicopters. It can 
have no more than 60,000 troops. 
  According to Dalibaltayan, the armed forces were brought up 
almost to their full strength and sufficiently well equipped 
with weapons and hardware. They were still wanting officers 
but, Dalibaltayan said, an all-arms army college was to open in 
Armenia this year. 
  Several think tanks related to the national Defense Ministry 
were working on Armenia's military doctrine. The staff under 
President Ter-Petrosyan would come out with a draft doctrine of 
their own, Dalibaltayan said. 
  Whether or not Armenia supplied Nagorno-Karabakh with 
weapons 
and army hardware, was absolutely immaterial, he said, because 
in the course of combat operations the Karabakh defense forces 
had captured enormous stocks of weapons and hardware, materiel 
and ammunition. 
  A sufficient number of Armenian volunteers went to defend 
the 
sovereignty of Karabakh, Dalibaltayan said.

  [Text] The volume of Lithuanian production dropped by 9.7 
percent in May, compared to April, the Lithuanian Statistics 
Department said. 
  On the slide beginning with early this year, except March 
when there was an improvement of 14 percent, it shrank 12 
percent in January, 10 in February and another 17 in April. The 
rise of production in March is explained by a shorted working 
month in February. 
  Except oil refining, in May produce by processing and mining 
industries slowed by 6.2 percent. Compared to March, in April 
generation of electricity dropped sharply, while production of 
electricity, heat, gas and water jointly reduced by 50 percent. 
  In May, production by Lithuanian industry was estimated at a 
total of 850 million lits. Demand for electricity for 
commercial ends rose by 8.2 percent in May. Compared to April, 
in May there has been a drastic improvement production of oil 
(up 177 percent), detergents (149), canned meat (121), tape 
recorders (78), TV tubes (52), soft drinks (39) and lacquers and 
paints (16-fold). Relative to April, slower production involved 
fuel pumps (down 92 percent), electricity meters (59), household 
refrigerator compressors (47) and cardboard (48). 
  Over the month, exports to the West weakened from 15.2 
percent in April to 14.7 percent in May with exports to the CIS, 
Latvia and Estonia dropping from 30.8 down to 27.3 percent. In 
May domestic sales were up 4 percent and dealt with 58 percent 
of overall goods manufactured.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Interviewed by a UNIAN 
correspondent, Shimon Peres, head of the Israeli external 
political department, noted that in spite of this being his 
"first time in Odessa," he "understood why this beautiful city 
is the soul of all the world's Jews." 
  Asked whether he could draw a parallel between the issue of 
Crimean autonomy in Ukraine and that of Palestine in Israel, the 
minister answered in the affirmative: "Undoubtedly so. In both 
cases, efforts to improve relations are more expedient than 
amending borders. Under conditions of tension, there is no 
point in talking about borders. An atmosphere of mutual respect 
should be created. This would guarantee success in our 
negotiations in the United States. Progress begins when the 
sides realize that force gives in to intelligence."

  [Text] Kiev 16 June TASS -- Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko and his Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres have 
praised results of the latter's two days' official visit to 
Ukraine. 
  "Successful development of friendship and cooperation 
between 
our countries" was once again reaffirmed during the visit, 
Zlenko told a press conference on Thursday [16 Jun]. 
  According to him, Ukraine became native land for many Jews. 
They made a contribution to Ukrainian culture. 
  In this connection, he mentioned large-scale festivities 
held 
in Ukraine to mark the 135th anniversary of Sholom Aleykhem, a 
classic of Jewish literature. 
  According to Peres, his stay in Ukraine has made a very good 
impression. I am sure we will be able to open a new chapter in 
the development of friendship and cooperation between Israel and 
Ukraine, Peres said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 18 (TASS) -- There is a positive thing 
about the public accord treaty: "The political struggle in 
Russia ceases to be a political squabble and becomes a political 
competition," Sergey Filatov, chief of staff of the president's 
administration, said today. He spoke at a meeting of the public 
chamber under the Russian president. The public chamber 
discussed the implementation of the treaty, signed by 863 
representatives of power structures, regions, parties and public 
organisations. 
  Filatov believes at the same time that it is too early for 
democratically-minded reformers to relax in conditions of 
relative political stability. In his opinion, "a period of an 
easy-term credit of confidence for the reformers is over." 
  He urged the like-minded people to combine two principles in 
their ideology -- patriotism and democracy, and on their basis 
to work for accord in society. In order to work out a strategy 
of joint actions, the reformers will hold a forum of democratic 
forces next autumn in Moscow. 
  The purpose of today's meeting of the public chamber was to 
set up five commissions included in it -- on political 
stability, on socio-economic problems, on the federal setup and 
inter-ethnic relations, on the safety of individuals and the 
security of society and on problems of science, education and 
culture. Those commissions were assigned the task of organising 
control over the implementation of the public accord treaty and 
drawing up recommendations to be approved at meetings of the 
public chamber.

  [Text] On Sunday Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha 
told Interfax that the Agrarian party, its faction in the State 
Duma and the Central Committee of the Union of Workers of the 
Agro-Industrial Complex could yet be expected to sign the civic 
accord agreement after they met, to clear up positions, with 
President Yeltsin on June 27. 
  The Vice-Premier in charge of agriculture was elected a 
member of the State Duma on the ticket of the Agrarian party 
which brings together almost 200,000 men and women. Russia's 
one and only Agrarian labor union boasts a membership of almost 
16 million. 
  According to Zaveryukha, the Agrarians had failed to sign 
the 
civic accord agreement owing to differences of opinion on 
government support for the agro-industrial complex. In 
addition, he said, the labor union and the government differed 
on the issue of social insurance. 
  But, Zaveryukha said, the Agrarian faction in the State Duma 
supported the president- and government-backed draft of the 
Federal budget although those who had signed the civic accord 
agreement opposed the draft.

  [Text] The Public Chamber under President Yeltsin upheld 
Sergey Filatov's proposal for focusing on the realization of the 
civic accord agreement on June 23. Filatov is the chief of 
staff under Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Public Chamber is to have commissions on political 
stability, social and economic problems, administrative makeup 
and interethnic relations, security, and science research, 
education and culture. 
  The five commissions will be expected to supervise the 
realization of the civic accord agreement and offer advice to 
the conciliatory commission. 
  In Filatov's view, they must have a membership of twenty 
nine 
and bring together representatives of political movements and 
parties, parliamentary factions, public organizations, labor 
unions, religious communities, etc. 
  Arkadiy Volskiy, Mark Masarskiy, Anatoliy Dolganov, Viktor 
Andreyev and Vladimir Kudriavtsev were presented as choices for 
the commission's chairmen. According to Filatov, they represent 
"a wide spectrum of the Russian public" because their political 
affiliations as well as jobs they hold are very different.

  [Text] Former USSR prime minister Nikolay Ryzhkov denied 
rumors that he had agreed to run for Russian presidency. 
  Aleksandr Sterligov, the leader of the opposition Russian 
National Assembly, and Sazhi Umalatova, chairperson of the 
so-called permanent presidium of the USSR Congress of People's 
Deputies, had mentioned the possibility of nominating Ryzhkov 
for presidency in their public addresses. 
  Ryzhkov told Interfax that Sterligov and Umalatova expressed 
their personal views when they spoke of him as a man who could 
rally all opposition forces for the forthcoming presidential 
elections. 
  He admitted that numerous people think that he might be 
helpful in consolidating society to an extent. 
  Ryzhkov assumed that his name was mentioned because people 
were tired of radicalism in any form, from Yegor Gaydar's shock 
therapy to Zhirinovsky's promises. Ryzhkov said that he had 
never shared extreme views but stayed somewhat left of the 
center. 
  He did not believe the opposition-spread rumors that Boris 
Yeltsin intended to call pre-term presidential elections next 
fall or to extend his and the Federal Assembly's terms. 
  Ryzhkov, 64, was the USSR's prime minister in 1985-90. Now 
he heads the Moscow Intellectual and Business Club and chairs 
the board of the Tveruniversalbank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Democratic </F>
Choice party by correspondent Medvedev in an unidentified office 
setting; date not given; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Yegor Timurovich, the congress is over and now one 
can sum up some of its results. It seems to me that people and, 
in particular, journalists, are wondering who exactly acquired 
who. Was it you who acquired the Olbi firm or the Olbi firm 
acquired you, the Democratic Choice party? 
  [Gaydar] We thought that the first two jokes might be 
something like this -- the Russia's Choice party bought a bit of 
Olbi and the latter, Olbi, bought a bit of Russia's Choice. 
  [Medvedev] Do you look upon such jokes with a sense of humor 
or do you take them seriously? 
  [Gaydar] I approach them with a sense of humor. I treat this 
as something inevitable. 
  [Medvedev] It was your idea that Oleg Boyko [chairman of the 
party's executive committee] was one of the party's leaders. 
Why? 
  [Gaydar] Without any doubt, our party needs intelligentsia 
and entrepreneurs. It should not be a party of just 
intelligentsia or a party of just entrepreneurs. In my view, we 
do better when intelligentsia joins forces with entrepreneurs 
and we fail when they act separately. In connection with this, 
the idea of including a respected and prominent entrepreneur in 
the party's leadership was the right one. 
  [Medvedev] The president did not send his regards or any 
message of greetings to the congress, so your relations with the 
president remain somewhat unclear. It was officially stated in 
the press some time ago that you still were the presidential 
party. 
  [Gaydar] I really do not like the word "presidential" party. 
It evokes an image of orderly files of top officials under the 
president's command joining the party. I do not think the 
president likes it too much either. 
  We are the party that is without doubt a political and 
strategic ally for the president. This, however, does not mean 
that there are no disagreements between us and him. For 
instance, an edict on the fight against organized crime was 
published this week. I am convinced that it is a mistake. I am 
convinced that violation of human rights cannot be justified by 
invoking most serious situation with criminality. I am 
convinced that attempts to fight crime by curbing human rights 
cannot result in anything but administrative racketeering, 
arbitrariness, and extortion of bribes. I very much hope the 
president will review his decision, that he will listen to our 
arguments. 
  Nonetheless, despite our disagreements even on important 
matters, I am convinced that on the most vital matters of 
Russia's future, Russian democracy and reforms in Russia, we are 
allies and our views coincide. 
  [Medvedev] It is clear from the party manifesto what its aim 
is. It is to win, to win the elections. What is not clear is 
who will be the main candidate. If the president decides to 
continue his campaign for the presidential post, will Gaydar 
fight against him, or will he withdraw from the race? Or is it 
too early to ask? 
  [Gaydar] We will do everything within our powers to ensure 
that a single democratic candidate with the best chance of 
success is put forward and backed. No one's personal ambitions, 
including mine, God forbid, will stand in the way. 
  [Medvedev] Do you think that with the existing disagreements 
between yourself, say, Sergey Shakhray [leader of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord], and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy [leader of 
the YabLoko bloc], is it possible to have a single candidate? 
  [Gaydar] Well, I think President Yeltsin is the most likely 
choice.

<F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar: "Will Zhirinovskiy Avoid Public </F>
Trial?"] 
  [Text] In December last year I said publicly that Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy reminds me of Hitler in 1929. Zhirinovskiy took 
offense and sued me. 
  Explaining and developing my metaphor, I published an 
article 
in IZVESTIYA under what seemed to me the quite expressive 
headline "Gambling on Scoundrels." The main content of the 
article came down to the idea that Zhirinovskiy's political 
activity was ideally suited to the definition of "fascist" and 
that he himself in terms of some of his personal features could 
serve as a graphic illustration in a museum on the history of 
fascism. 
  This article seems to have made a powerful impression on 
Zhirinovskiy. As far as I can judge (I express myself so 
cautiously because information on his behavior is never 
accurate) he did two things. First he withdrew his lawsuit, 
explaining he was satisfied with the explanations I gave in my 
article. That is, this can be assessed as meaning that 
previously Zhirinovskiy did not guess he was a fascist but now 
that he has read the article and thought about it he has 
realized that yes, he is a fascist. Which satisfied him, and 
there he stopped. But there immediately followed a second 
action: Zhirinovskiy is suing me again, for the same article! 
  I admit that from my viewpoint there is a certain 
contradiction between these two actions. I adhere to 
old-fashioned logic in which there is no third option. Either 
something is or it is not. Either he is satisfied with the 
article or he is not. 
  But obviously Zhirinovskiy's logic is different. I cannot 
say it surprises me, it is in fact a pure example of the logic 
and conduct of a fascist politician. A small example of how 
demagoguery and lies are promoted as an example and taken to the 
limit, to the absurd. 
  Therefore as long as a fascist is not in power his words and 
actions cause tittering and are declared a farce. As soon as he 
comes to power the titters turn to groans and farce to tragedy. 
  It is not the pleasantest task to rake over piles of absurd, 
fantastic lies which he scatters at every step with unusual ease 
and shamelessness, trapping the credulous with this bait. It is 
simpler to keep quiet or to turn away squeamishly. But in the 
case of fascists keeping quiet means indulging them. So I shall 
unconditionally do everything in my power to ensure that there 
is a public trial of Zhirinovskiy, a public trial of fascist 
ideology and propaganda in our country.

<F P=106> [Yekaterina Achalova report: "FITUR Board Plenum. Trade </F>
Unions Change Ally"] 
  [Text] Addressing yesterday's sitting of the executive 
committee of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of 
Russia [FITUR], Federation head Mikhail Shmakov accused Yuriy 
Skokov of attempting to break up the FITUR and create on its 
basis another trade union organization. The sharpness of the 
accusation was provoked by the fact that Skokov is building 
contacts with regional trade unions bypassing the FITUR's 
central leadership and actually stripping them of control. 
  Earlier, the FITUR cooperated with the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs [RUIE] whose president Arkadiy 
Volskiy masterminded the creation of a Trilateral Conciliation 
Commission -- the RUIE, the FITUR, and the government -- so that 
trade unions could refer their demands directly to the 
government. In the wake of October 1993 the government stopped 
delegating its ranking representatives to the commission's 
sessions, which rendered the RUIE's cooperation with the FITUR 
less interesting. When Volskiy's centrists suffered complete 
defeat in the December elections and finally departed the list 
of influential political forces, all reasons for FITUR-RUIE 
cooperation were totally lost. Trade unions bosses and 
entrepreneurs started to look around for new partners. 
  An apolitical mode of life under the leadership of Mikhail 
Shmakov looked to union bosses not exciting enough, and they 
started to look for a new Big Brother for political gambles. 
Producers of commodities suited the role best. Four major 
trade unions associations of the Urals, Siberia, the Northern 
Caucasus, and the Central Volga, decided to secure support from 
Skokov and signed an interaction agreement with him. 
  This agreement may soon lead to a split of the Federation. 
Offended by the behavior of Skokov, who ignored all proposals 
for a meeting and who played up to his subordinates behind their 
boss's back, Mikhail Shmakov intends to press for the annulment 
of the agreement. But since the FITUR is a typical example of a 
political partner always on the lookout for someone to form a 
bloc with, it is doubtful that union officials will listen to 
their chairman and give up so opportune an idea as an alliance 
with Skokov.

  [Text] Sergey Filatov, leader of the presidential 
administration, declared that the criminal related situation in 
Russia "is on the brink of an emergency one" and this explains 
the necessity of Boris Yeltsin's decree on urgent measures to 
protect the population from banditism and organized crime. 
  "When as many as ten explosions are registered over 24 
hours, 
it means that bandit formations force their ideology of life to 
the society," he said in his interview with Interfax Saturday. 
  At the same time Filatov pointed out that part of the 
society 
expresses its disagreement with Yeltsin's decree due to the 
provision on possible detention of the suspected for 30 days. 
He recognized that this method "has been actually taken from 
the decree on the state of emergency." 
  In Filatov's opinion, those, who say that this provision of 
the presidential decree should be compensated in the legal sense 
"by removing the old fear of the people in the face of the 
unrestricted power of the law enforcement bodies," are quite 
right. Filatov believes that it is possible to achieve this 
involving the conciliatory commission in charge for the 
implementation of the Agreement on Public Accord. 
  Filatov is known to be chairman of this commission.

  [Text] A special directorate for searching and detaining 
criminals will be set up in Russia in the very near future, 
Sergey Stepashin, director of the federal counterintelligence 
service, has said at a news conference in Vladivostok. He also 
said the special services of Japan, North Korea, and China had 
recently stepped up their activities in the Maritime Kray. 
  Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how, 
in the light of the latest decree by the Russian president on 
the immediate measures to protect the population against 
banditism and other forms of organized crime, local 
counterintelligence and interior directorates would interact, 
Stepashin said the federal counterintelligence service next week 
would sign an agreement with Viktor Yerin, interior minister of 
the Russian Federation, which would define the interaction and 
division of powers between the two departments. In Sergey 
Stepashin's words, it has been decided to put an end to 
competition between the departments. From now on 
counterintelligence officers, jointly with the interior 
ministry, will deal in real earnest with cases of corruption in 
the top echelons of state power and a number of organized crime 
groups using the channel of international terrorism and drugs 
smuggling. The federal counterintelligence service will help 
the interior ministry with equipment. 
  Sergey Stepashin said the president in the very near future 
would sign a decree setting up a special directorate in the 
federal intelligence service and territorial directorates, 
accordingly. Thus, counterintelligence will get the opportunity 
to participate directly in searching, detaining, and eliminating 
those who encroach upon the law and people's rights and lives. 
  The director of the federal counterintelligence service also 
visited the major port town of Nakhodka.

<F P=106> [A.I. report: "Cadres Are Paramount. Will The Military </F>
District Prosecutor Also Be Kicked Out?"] 
  [Text] A tough, under-the-rug struggle seems to be 
proceeding in the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's 
Office, where Aleksey Ilyushenko is still the acting prosecutor. 
Yet one can only judge of this indirectly. Thus, recently 
three deputy general prosecutors at once lost their posts, 
whereupon Ilyushenko got around to department chiefs. In the 
very near future the entire leadership of the Moscow Military 
District Prosecutor's Office could also be replaced. District 
prosecutor Mikhail Kislitsyn, who lately closed the Terekhov 
case over the 3-4 October events following an amnesty, has 
obviously annoyed Ilyushenko. Even so, the acting prosecutor 
has not as yet countermanded Kislitsyn's decision (which he has 
every right to do) and it is not ruled out that he will soon 
invoke his other powers: to appoint and dismiss personnel. 
Rumor has it that an order to remove Kislitsyn is pending. 
  Kislitsyn was appointed to his post only a few months ago. 
It is known that recently he was offered the position of deputy 
chief military prosecutor, which he refused for unknown reasons. 
At that time, the vacancy unexpectedly went to Stanislav 
Gaveto, who has been serving in Moscow all these years. It is 
not clear what has brought about his rise. This is a question 
for Valentin Panichev, who heads the Military Prosecutor's 
Office. Up till now Gaveto has held secondary positions. It is 
not ruled out, however, that the appointment has been made on 
Ilyushenko's initiative and is aimed at getting rid of Panichev 
himself, one of the few deputies who have survived the purge in 
the General Prosecutor's Office.

  [Text] The media can play a negative role in Russia's 
political life, said Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, 
addressing on Monday the International Conference on the Role 
and Responsibility of the Media in the Development of Democracy 
and Tolerance. 
  "The recent parliamentary elections showed that a pathetic 
political dwarf and scandalous figure can turn into a leader of 
a parliamentary party due to a few snappy appearances on TV," he 
said without disclosing the name of the politician he meant. 
  He believes that the danger of nationalism is still 
threatening the country and that chauvinism and nationalism are 
evident in many democratic publications. 
  He urged reporters to quote official statements more 
exactly, 
providing critical comments on them. "This will help highlight 
the authors' idiocy," he said.

<F P=106> ["Open letter to the president, the prime minister, the </F>
chairman of the Federation Council, and the chairman of the 
State Duma," signed by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's chief editor and 
general director; date not given: "How Will ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
Implement the Law?"] 
  [Text] We are addressing you in connection with the 
adoption and publication of the federal Law "On the Procedure 
for the Promulgation and Entry Into Force of Federal 
Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws, and Enactments of the 
Chambers of the Federal Assembly." Article 4 contains a 
specific instruction -- that the official promulgation of laws 
and acts is deemed to consist in the first publication of the 
complete text in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA. 
  We had been expecting this law. And we recognize that it not 
only does the newspaper an honor, but also imposes a great 
responsibility on it. It is necessary promptly and accurately 
to convey to the mass reader (whether he lives centrally, in a 
remote area, or abroad) the documents by which Russians are to 
live. 
  The technological process for the publication of these 
documents has been developed. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's printing and 
distribution network, though not perfect, is effective and has 
good prerequisites for development and improvement. And that is 
the main thing. Many people print documents, but to do it like 
this -- with a large print run, on a specific day, reaching 
every corner of the country, reaching the precise destination -- 
probably only ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA can do this now. 
  Our awareness of the importance of this task is what makes 
the editorial collective perform real miracles, despite 
extremely meager budget financing. Having taken over the 
newspaper with huge debts in October 1993, in order not to stop 
producing the paper we were forced to put the editorial staff on 
starvation rations, cut the number of employees, make economies 
literally everywhere, and constantly reallocate money and paper. 
But the main thing is that the editorial office started to make 
money. Although the government finances only just over 
one-third of the cost of producing the newspaper, ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA is still coming out. Primarily because the editorial 
office itself covers a further one-third of the newspaper's 
budget. 
  So it transpires that today we and the government are equal 
partners. It was not easy: Just you try to make money starting 
not from zero (Khasbulatov's ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was 100-percent 
state subsidized), but from a large minus number (debts). And 
without selling out to commercial structures, from which there 
were tempting offers. 
  All the same, with an editorial budget deficit of one-third, 
it has not been possible to avoid production stoppages. Readers 
in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Saratov, Rostov, Krasnodar, 
Irkutsk, and other cities failed to receive copies of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA containing edicts, laws, decrees, and 
directives. In some of those cities production of the newspaper 
stopped for a month or more. 
  We are reaping the fruits now. Although even preliminary 
subscription figures for the second half-year are not yet 
available, a marked reduction in the number of subscribers can 
be confidently predicted. 
  Frankly speaking, this is advantageous to the editorial 
office in economic terms -- it means fewer losses. But in terms 
of building a rule-of-law state, Russia loses a great deal. 
These losses cannot be measured against economic benefits. 
  And now we have this law. Of course, we will implement it. 
But we are not yet capable of taking this burden on our own 
shoulders alone. 
  [Signed] Chief editor, General director

  [Text] There are no disagreements between the Russian 
president and the chairman of government, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
said today talking to journalists before leaving by air for 
Italy. 
  The head of the Russian Government stressed that he has had 
no disagreements with Boris Yeltsin from the start and he does 
not have them now. Nevertheless, there are forces which would 
like to create the impression of such disagreements, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said. 
  Among the government's priority tasks for the next month, he 
mentioned the beginning of the second stage of privatization, 
the curbing of inflation at the level of the last few months, 
and the improvement of conditions for direct investments in the 
Russian economy. 
  This was an RIA report.

  [Text] Russian Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin hopes 
that on June 22 the State Duma will endorse the final draft of 
the Federal budget for 1994. 
  Talking to newsmen at Moscow's Vnukovo-2 airport before 
boarding a flight for Milan, Chernomyrdin said the Federation 
Council, too, would be able to see what was what in the economy 
and would endorse the budget. 
  According to Chernomyrdin, the Duma committees had done a 
great job. After the draft budget was presented to the Duma on 
May 11, he said, they came out with more than 300 amendments to 
that document. Doing it all over again would make no sense, 
Chernomyrdin said. His impression was, some individuals were 
simply afraid to have nothing to do. 
  In Chernomyrdin's view, it was about time for the government 
to work on a draft budget for 1995, instead of going back to 
what it had already done. 
  Chernomyrdin said the government had pledged to come out 
with 
a draft budget for 1995 in September.

  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin felt Industrial recession could 
be over in Russia as early as next month. An analysis of 
economic developments gave hope for that, Chernomyrdin told a 
reporter for Interfax before boarding a flight for Milan, on 
Sunday. The key economic indices showed no recession in June, 
he said, so that next month Russia could establish itself on a 
bridgehead for economic stabilization. 
  Chernomyrdin saw financial stabilization as one of his main 
achievements. He felt that in conformity with government plans 
monthly inflation rate would not top 7 to 9 percent at the end 
of 1994. Action could, but would not, be taken to reduce 
inflation rate to zero, he said. 
  The Chernomyrdin Cabinet assigned priority to work on the 
second stage of its privatization scheme, the endorsement of a 
final draft of the country's budget for 1994, the solution of 
the problem of delayed payments and an analysis of the economic 
developments of the first six months of 1994. 
  It was also essential, he said, that the government move to 
lure more investment, including domestic, in the economy. 
Foreign investment was equally important, he said. 
  On June 27 he would call a sitting of the investment 
policies 
council. The world's leading business executives had been 
invited to attend, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Gorlov under the "In the Government" </F>
rubric: "Russian Economy Enters Market Although This Did Not 
Come Easy to It"] 
  [Text] The results of the country's economic growth in the 
first half of the year were summed up at yesterday's Russian 
Federation Government session. The period in question does not 
end for another two weeks but, because all manner of rush jobs 
have been consigned to oblivion, the Council of Ministers deemed 
it necessary to draw conclusions on the basis of preliminary 
data from the State Committee for Statistics and the Economy 
Ministry. Especially as the situation in the economy has become 
more or less predictable. 
  There were no revelations at the government session. The 
steady economic decline, which manifests itself particularly 
sharply in machine building and light industry, continues. On 
the whole we have "slimmed down" by over one-fourth compared 
with the middle of last year. The production of agricultural 
produce and electricity and the extraction of fuel and energy 
raw materials are decreasing, albeit at a slower rate. The 
volume of mutual nonpayments is increasing, and unemployment is 
making it presence felt increasingly strongly. The deficit of 
the still unapproved federal budget is balancing at a critical 
level. 
  Yet in the government's opinion there are no grounds for 
panic. The main encouraging conclusion is that the Russian 
economy -- albeit in a bumbling fashion and battered and bruised 
-- has entered the market. Certain islets of stabilization, 
operating on purely market principles, are appearing. Inflation 
has sharply dropped its pace and become practically 
controllable. The domestic market is becoming increasingly 
saturated and balanced. A steadily positive foreign trade 
turnover has developed. The population's real money incomes 
increased 11 percent compared with last June, and citizens' 
savings are growing at a fast rate. 
  On the whole the first -- voucher -- stage of privatization 
is ending successfully and the program for its second stage, 
whose implementation will begin as early as 1 July, has been 
promptly worked out. In this context an upswing in investment 
activity can be expected. A program to reorganize and bankrupt 
unprofitable enterprises, which indicates the beginning of 
practical work to structurally reorganize the economy, has been 
coordinated with monetary privatization. 
  Many problems regarding the creation of a normative base for 
reforms have been solved. The latest "economic" edicts of the 
Russian Federation president have made an important contribution 
to this. In general, it was noted at the government session, 
the main preconditions enabling the gradual revival of our 
economy to begin have been created. 
  The main problem now is maybe that the ministries and 
departments responsible for economic transformations are late in 
creating mechanisms for implementing decisions made by the 
president and government. 
  The Council of Ministers session also discussed progress in 
implementing the Russian Federation president's edicts on 
economic reform questions, questions concerning price formation 
in the energy complex and in transport, and questions concerning 
the rate of insurance contributions to the social insurance 
fund, as well as the draft Russian Federation Law "On Making 
Amendments and Additions to Certain Russian Federation 
Legislative Acts in Connection with the Adoption of the Russian 
Federation Law `On the Status of Servicemen.'"

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from the "This is the News" roundup: </F>
"Optimism Against Gloomy Background"] 
  [Text] "On the whole, the necessary conditions for 
advancing along the path of reforms have been created in 
society," Russian Federation First Deputy Minister for the 
Economy Yakov Urinson declared yesterday at a government 
sitting, summing up the preliminary results of the first six 
months of 1994. 
  By his assertion, the government program adopted earlier to 
stabilize the situation in the economy is beginning to show 
"tangible, positive results, and talk about the collapse and 
fatal line of the economy are unsubstantiated." 
  As for specific figures, however, according to data from the 
Ministry for the Economy the GDP (in fixed prices) fell by 
almost 18 percent compared to the same period last year. 
Overall, the volume of industrial output went down by 27 
percent, falling by almost half in the machine building and 
metalworking sectors. 
  According to expert evaluations, money supply will increase 
by roughly 60 percent (8 percent per month). Inflation, by 
comparison with December of last year, will comprise around 90 
percent. Industrial producers' wholesale prices will double.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Directors Face Choice: </F>
Contract or Privatization?"] 
  [Text] It would seem that the broad working masses of 
officials and the no less broad masses of politicians who form 
the image of the centrist statesmen have gotten their way: The 
president has signed a document whose aim is to increase the 
controllability of state property. But the edict "On Some 
Measures to Ensure State Control of the Economy" will hardly 
cause them great delight. 
  Because what this document presupposes is by no means the 
approach toward the problem of increasing controllability which 
the centrist statesmen had in mind when criticizing the 
authorities for their idleness. After all, in proclaiming their 
slogans the supporters of a certain section of the directors' 
corps were in fact seeking primarily an increase in state 
financing. 
  The edict abolishes the directors' sinecure -- the mechanism 
for complete economic control which enabled the leaders of state 
enterprises in fact to privatize their plants and factories in 
their own interests. 
  What has happened until now? The director at the enterprise 
was the full master of the situation. I do what I want and no 
one has the right to punish me, still less dismiss me. But now 
the state will conclude contracts with directors for the right 
to manage their own property. These contracts will guarantee 
what is far from a comfortable existence: All kinds of 
"compensations," "social guarantees," "size of guaranteed 
remuneration," and so on and so forth.... 
  But the leader's responsibility for economic results is also 
established. And there is even "material liability for damage 
caused to the enterprise as a result of the action or inaction 
of the enterprise leader." If the state does not like the 
manager it has hired, the contract can be dissolved. 
  If property at the enterprise is joint-stock property and 
the 
state owns only part of it, it delegates its representative to 
the joint-stock company's management organs. This 
representative must coordinate with the federal organs of 
executive power or the Russian federal property fund the most 
important questions of the enterprise's activity, which will be 
put to the vote. For instance, questions like the introduction 
of changes and alterations to joint-stock companies' charter 
documents, the alteration of the size of incorporation capital, 
the appointment of persons under contract to organs of 
management and control. 
  Without the state's agreement the joint-stock company will 
not now be able to obtain credit of more than 10 percent the 
size of the company's net assets, to sell or mortgage its real 
estate, or to take part in the creation of other enterprises or 
in the financing of industrial groups. In brief, the first 
obstacles have been erected to the pilfering of state property. 
  There is no doubt that the question arises: Will the edict 
operate effectively? Obviously problems will arise. They 
always arise where the need for any agreements appears. They 
arise if only because the mechanism of state control of 
enterprises in the transitional period is not harmonious in 
general, because to this day there is a vigorous surreptitious 
interdepartmental struggle for the right to control this process. 
  And it is still far from clear who will win this 
struggle.... 
  But in any case, Sergey Pavlenko, leader of the Russian 
Government's working center for economic reforms, believes, this 
edict will be a serious spur to enterprise leaders finally 
deciding whether they should carry out privatization in full and 
become absolutely free and independent, including independent of 
state financial support, or still wait for state financing. But 
then they can forget all the delights of full economic control, 
reveal all sources of income, and, essentially, become ordinary 
hired managers in the state's service.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- The package of decrees 
concerning Russia's economic development signed by President 
Boris Yeltsin in May and June is closely linked to the 
unprecedented situation in the country's economy at present, 
according to Aleksandr Livshits, the leader of the president's 
group of experts. 
  Livshits told a press conference here today that the 
distinguishing feature of the situation is that the inflation 
rate has been relatively moderate over the past four months, 
which brought down the inflation expectations of the population, 
and no production slump was registered in the first half of June 
from May. "It was necessary to make full use of this 
circumstance," the economist stressed. 
  Aleksandr Livshits said the reaction to the economic decrees 
in Moscow and the country as a whole was "restrained but 
positive". 
  The decrees are not ideal, particularly those among them 
which call for more discipline, Livshits admitted. But few 
people have rejected them out right. As concerns statements 
about the unconstitutional character of some provisions, 
Livshits noted that some of the documents deal with problems 
which are not covered by federal legislation at all. It is 
possible that some provisions may be at variance with 
legislation but "none of the decrees transcends the boundaries 
of the president's message on the state of the nation which was 
supported by the State Duma", or the boundaries of the 
obligations assumed by the president and the government under 
the Treaty on Civic Accord. 
  He also pointed out that the use of decrees "to boost 
reforms 
is a forced measure," but the president had "displayed patience 
long enough". If the State Duma steps up activity in law 
making, there will be no need for presidential decrees at all, 
Livshits said. It would be ideal to have the presidential 
decrees "dissolved" in subsequent federal laws. 
  Livshits drew particular attention to the decree concerning 
the activity of foreign banks in Russia. He described it as 
"the most dramatic of them all", and the story of its 
preparation as "a plot for an interesting tale". The question 
was not whether to let foreign banks into Russia but when and 
what terms. There is no indicator of the most appropriate time, 
it is a question of political intuition. "It was necessary to 
sense the almost invisible edge to walk on", without infringing 
on the rights of either foreign or Russian banks. According to 
Livshits, the choice was made correctly. The decree allows five 
or six foreign banks, which already have licenses, to begin 
operations in Russia from July this year instead of January 1, 
1996. As concerns new licencing, decisions on this will be made 
by the Central Bank of Russia, depending on the conditions one 
or another country provides for Russian banks. On the whole, 
the agrement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and 
the European Union, which will be signed soon, will "clear up 
considerably" the problem of relations with foreign banks. 
  In the field of the taxation policy, Livshits said, a 
tougher 
tax paying discipline will be enforced ("this decree will meet 
with most resistance," Livshits said). All tax benefits will be 
annulled, and the enterprises will be prohibited from settling 
accounts in cash, which enable them to evade taxation.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's senior economic adviser 
Aleksandr Lifshits said, in Saturday's interview with Interfax, 
that the next stage of the government's privatization scheme 
must be presented to the people as a federal law. 
  All decisions on further privatization must be made by joint 
effort, Lifshits said. He predicted that Moscow and the 
provinces would debate the right to sell formerly state-owned 
property and said there would be problems with the division of 
revenues and different views of who was to control the stocks 
which had fallen into the government's lap. 
  The Russian legislature was to decide whether the Russian 
government or the State Property Committee would be entitled to 
sell the country's major industrial enterprises. 
  In Lifshits' view, it would be very difficult to pass 
appropriate legislation, "more difficult, in fact, than have a 
national budget approved by the Federal Assembly". But, he 
said, Federal legislation must underlie moves for more 
privatization, or else there would be a collision of different 
views. Lifshits hoped, however, that different approaches would 
be discussed "in a civilized manner" without hindering work for 
civic accord.

  [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- The next package of the 
president's economic decrees will contain a decree on the 
dramatic reduction of mobilisation plans and reserve capacities 
at enterprises of the defence complex. Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Economy Aleksandr Shokhin announced today at a 
meeting of the public chamber under the president of the Russian 
Federation. 
  According to Shokin, the purpose of the decree is to promote 
the working out of a new military doctrine and to reduce the 
state order to the defence industry. 
  It is worth recalling that during his recent tour of the 
country Yeltsin mentioned the forthcoming reduction of the army 
from three million to 1.5 million and urged enterprises of the 
defence complex to take up conversion. "The Russian Army does 
not need a large amount of armaments. It needs mobile military 
hardware, which can stand competition at the domestic and 
foreign markets," the president said. His stand has been 
reflected in the forthcoming decree.

energy minister, France now occupies a special place in the 
struggle for world atomic markets and nuclear fuel quotas. It 
has been striving to supply even atomic power stations to the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. For this reason, the agreement of 
the European Union to our atomic exports is important. 
  Konovalov said prices for low-grade material are falling 
sharply. This is connected with a surplus and free capacities at 
most enterprises. 
  Since the collapse of the USSR, the fuel and nuclear complex 
has been concentrated in Russia. We are now producing 
everything including atomic fuel, highly sophisticated equipment 
for atomic power stations, and the cheapest energy. We are not 
building new stations but we are completing the construction of 
a number of uranium units and making some things for China and 
East European countries. According to the deputy minister, we 
are not purchasing anything abroad. However, four conversion 
production lines have been delivered and they have made it 
possible to convert the parts of the Krasnoyarsk chemical 
combine which once carried out military atomic orders into one 
of Europe's largest production facilities for audio and video 
cassettes. The Germans are taking uranium rods for their 
nuclear power stations in payment. Because of a failure to pay, 
we are unable to supply our fellow-countrymen, and this 
threatens our own nuclear power stations with closure.

  [Text] Prague, June 14 RIA -- Agreements between the 
government of the Russian Federation and the government of the 
Czech Republic on cooperation in the area of quarantine and 
protection of plants and of veterinary [as received] were signed 
Monday in Prague by Russian Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor 
Khlystun and Czech Agriculture Minister Jozef Luks. 
  According to the Russian minister, "After the completion of 
the process of the formation of the independence of both Russia 
and the Czech Republic a real possibility has emerged not only 
to resume on a previous scale, but also to significantly expand 
mutually beneficial Russian-Czech relations." He said the 
emphasis in agriculture and food production would be on the 
creation of joint ventures and on joint investment. 
  Speaking at a news conference, Czech Agriculture Minister 
Jozef Luks stressed that "Russia remains one of the most 
important trading and economic partners of the Czech Republic." 
"For us it is essential to produce the products that can be 
realised on the Russian market," declared Luks.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 7, RIA -- Oleg Soskovets, first 
vice premier of Russia, on an official visit in Malaysia, signed 
a contract for the supply of 18 Russian combat aircraft to that 
country today. Under the contract, Malaysia will receive 16 
MiG-29 combat aircraft and two MiG-29UB training planes, as well 
as auxiliary equipment and munitions worth 550.5 million 
dollars. There is also a provision for the training for 
Malaysian servicemen, for which purpose Russian specialists will 
be seconded to Malaysia. Malaysia is expected to pay 65 per cent 
of the contract value prior to the delivery. 
  MiG-29 jets will be souped up and will have an in-flight 
refuelling feature. They will carry extended-range air-to-air 
missiles with infra-red and active homing devices. The missiles 
can detect up to 10 aerial targets and lock on two targets at a 
time. The aircraft's bomb load will be increased from 2 to 3 
tonnes. The angle of attack will be increased from 26 to 28 
degrees. The operating range of the aircraft will grow from 
2,100 to 2,900 kilometres thanks to additional fuel tanks. 
  The parties also signed a contract under which subsidiaries 
of Russian aircraft-making factories will be built in Malaysia. 
It is also intended to set up a joint Russian-Malaysian 
maintenance centre to service MiG-29 supplied to that country. 
With that in view, the Russian Federation will lease to 
Malaysia two aircraft (MiG-29 and MiG-29UB) free of charge for 
ten years. 
  During the visit, an agreement on counter purchase of palm 
oil was signed. Under the agreement, 25 per cent of the price 
of the aircraft will be covered by exports of Malaysian palm oil 
to Russia. Initially, the Malaysian side insisted that palm oil 
should account for 400,000 dollars of the contract value, but 
the Russian representatives managed to lower the figure to 95.4 
million dollars. Importantly, Russia will have the right to 
re-export that oil to other Commonwealth states, Eastern 
European countries, Cuba, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi 
Arabia and Syria.

  [Text] Moscow, June 20, RIA -- President Boris Yeltsin of 
the Russian Federation has congratulated the American Chkalov 
Trans- Polar Flight Committee on its 20th anniversary [as 
received]. According to the presidential press service, way back 
in 1937, millions of Russians and Americans had applauded 
Valeriy Chkalov, Georgiy Baydukov and Aleksandr Belyakov who 
flew over the north pole all the way to the USA at the time. 
  Yeltsin hailed the committee's noble activities aimed at 
strengthening mutual understanding between Russia and America 
and promoting good relations between our two countries, wishing 
his members and all residents of Vancouver and Portland success 
in their work, peace, happiness and prosperity.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mikhail Gorbachev: "Keeping Russia Out Is a </F>
Mistake"] 
  [Text] Relations between Russia and the West are not going 
well. I believe the time has come to say so openly, not only 
because I see that the seeds shed by the old weeds in the past 
are still growing, but above all because I see a danger of other 
evil weeds being planted, more or less on purpose, on all sides, 
in line with a logic of alienness, or antithesis, for which 
there should no longer be any justification. 
  The annual G-7 summit will be held in Naples in a few weeks' 
time. I see that, after much shilly-shallying, it has been 
decided to hold an economic G-7 and a political G-8. In other 
words, the Big Seven will discuss economic trends in the world 
community among themselves, then they will move on, bringing 
Russia in, to look at the political situation. 
  Let me say straight away that, from some points of view, 
this 
is a step forward, as it means involving Russia in the analysis 
of and reaction to overall international problems. It thus 
means reducing the chances of mutual incomprehension, 
misunderstanding, and suspicion. However, from other points of 
view this attitude reveals an antiquated mindset. Indeed, my 
first objection concerns the legitimacy of separating politics 
and economics. To all intents and purposes, the Seven are 
telling Russia that they are the ones who wield real power, and 
that they are only granting it a consultative role as regards 
the consequences of the options that they, and only they, are 
entitled to select. 
  Does all this reflect actual reality? Only very partially. 
Russia is undoubtedly a country in difficulty, its currency is 
not convertible on the world market, it is deeply in debt, and 
its repayment capacity is limited. But its real weight in world 
affairs is certainly not less than that of Italy, or France, or 
Canada. So there are other, unconfessed, unspoken, but obvious 
reasons for keeping it out: There is a refusal to extend the 
membership of the club that lays down the rules of the game. 
  The West's objection that Russia is still a country that 
lacks stability, is susceptible to political and institutional 
upsets, and is therefore not entirely reliable is a weak excuse: 
Difficult though the situation may be, it would be 
inconceivable for Russia to "change camp." Keeping it out of 
the club increases its difficulties, from the psychological 
point of view as well, as it heightens its feeling of isolation 
and reinforces the obstacles to full integration. The truth of 
the matter is that the idea that the world has to be governed by 
the paramount interests of one side, the strongest, still 
survives. This is a very shortsighted brand of "realism." 
  However, membership of the club must not be the ultimate 
goal, the mere achievement of which is to be regarded as an end 
in itself. The G-7, even if it becomes the G-8, cannot -- and 
will not -- be the seat of government of a stable new world. It 
can only be, for a certain time, a transitional arrangement born 
of the needs of the moment, of the lack, or inadequacy, of 
fairer, more functional international structures. There will be 
problems if it ends up by taking on a permanent role that does 
not rightfully belong to it. Otherwise, sooner or later, the 
question will be raised in many quarters whether it is right for 
the world to be governed by a club whose members' only 
qualification is their economic and military strength. 
  Take the painful experience of the crisis in Yugoslavia. 
Strong as they are, the Great of the world have proved unable 
to prevent it, indeed they have ended up by encouraging it, 
precisely because there were no instruments for preventing it. 
This is what needs doing: creating them in as short a time as 
possible. Placing this issue on the Naples agenda would be a 
sign of awareness and responsibility. 
  Take the debate surrounding the Partnership for Peace as 
well. The West is inviting Russia simply to join. Russia is 
replying that it is willing to accept, but that it asks for a 
special status, to be granted to it on the grounds of its role 
as a major power. This is another example of the subservience 
of current Russian policy and of shortsightedness on the part of 
the West. Instead of prioritizing the creation of European 
structures, creating a security council for the CSCE, its own 
peacekeeping force, etc., and subsequently looking into the 
possibility of using NATO structures in this context, the 
factors are being inverted and NATO, which was created for the 
purposes of the Cold War, is being extended, quite apart from 
everything else. 
  Is this merely an error? I fear something more serious, a 
prolongation of the old logic of supremacy that the West is 
continuing to impose. The 50th anniversary celebrations for the 
opening of the second front give pause for bitter thought and 
concern. They have been presented in an unacceptable, 
unilateral manner, as if victory came about thanks to the 
decisive contribution of a single side of the coalition. This 
is not only a distortion of historical truth and an attempt to 
diminish the Soviet Union's crucial role in defeating Nazism. 
It is a symptom of a resurgence of ideology. 
  The fact that the opening of the second front was seriously 
delayed and that, as a result, the USSR was left alone to fight 
on the "first front" has been willfully forgotten and glossed 
over. This cost the population millions of victims, and it would 
have been right to commemorate them on this occasion. For the 
sake of argument, I could retort that Russia would have been 
glad to celebrate the anniversary a year ago, because it would 
have meant that the Normandy landing had taken place not in 
1944, but in 1943, when the USSR was entrenched in Stalingrad, 
when it was on the verge of catastrophe, when the troops were 
given the fateful order, number 227: "Not a single step back." 
  It is not my intention to underestimate the military and 
political significance of the Normandy landing. It reflected 
the spirit of the coalition, it was essential. But the outcome 
of the war had been decided by then, largely thanks to Soviet 
efforts. 
  President Clinton has mentioned the fact that the world 
"would have been a different place" without the Normandy 
landing, almost as if to say that the USSR was against it, as it 
was aiming to conquer Europe. This is worrying, as it 
contradicts the most elementary historical truth, the very 
interpretations of the then leaders, Roosevelt and Churchill 
included. But it also a sign of something worse: the desire to 
ignore common goals, the joint efforts to put an end to the Cold 
War and to build a new Europe and a new world order without 
suspicion and barriers. 
  The current Russian leadership has chosen to turn a blind 
eye, taking everything in its stride on the grounds that "it has 
always been that way." It is true, that was how it was. But 
anniversaries were celebrated differently then. We were not 
invited and we knew why: We belonged to different, opposing 
blocs. But not being invited today takes on another, unpleasant 
meaning, because we are partners now. I would say more: 
Present-day Germany and Italy should have attended as well, as 
that victory now represents a value common to all democracies. 
  It will be advisable to reflect on why this did not happen. 
It could mean that there are still those who have barriers and 
curtains in mind, and are ready to rebuild them.

  [Text] Moscow, June 17, RIA -- The Duma ought to protest 
against the recent presidential crime effort resolution before 
it sends the nation into utter disorder, Gennadiy Zyuganov, 
leader of the communist parliamentary group, said in a public 
statement. 
  The resolution ignores the new Russian constitution and 
brings back the atrocities of the 1930s. Mr. Yeltsin's other 
latest decisions are meant to leave the national economy in 
ruins and run counter to his own message on strengthening 
Russian statehood. 
  The communist group also demands the suspension of 
SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA daily revoked by an ad hoc commission to be set up for 
the purpose. 
  The group called former mps from all ex-Soviet republics to 
a 
congress of June 25 to demand the USSR re-established.

  [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- "I want to see the 
examination of the so-called case of the SCSE [State Committee 
for the State of Emergency] through. The people must know the 
truth about the August 1991 events," General of the Army 
Valentin Varennikov, former commander-in-chief of the land 
forces of the USSR, told a RIA correspondent. He is the only 
member of the SCSE to have rejected the amnesty announced by the 
State Duma. He demanded that the trial of his case should be 
continued, and its examination is to be resumed on June 21. 
  Varennikov thinks he is perfectly guiltless. "I shall be 
able 
to do my duty in court, to defend my honour and to give the 
names of those who are actually guilty of disintegrating the 
Soviet Union, an epochal event in the eyes of world history," 
the former commander of the land forces pointed out. He said 
that the court will have to summon as witnesses Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Dmitriy Yazov, Oleg Shenin and a number of other 
persons. "In my turn, I intend to invite to the court some 
politicians involved in the August events, particularly the 
president of Russia, and to testify as witnesses," Varennikov 
added. The general also said that lawyer Dmitriy Shteinberg 
will be his defence attorney, as before.

  [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "The creation of the party 
Russia's Democratic Choice has three positive elements," said 
Mikhail Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, at the 
first constituent congress of the party. To begin with, we 
witness the creation of a powerful democratic party, which could 
put an end to organisational quarrels in the democratic 
movement. Second, it has clear-cut domestic and foreign policy 
programmes, which boldly pinpoint the painful moments of the 
current situation. And third, the party will have a chance to 
work in regions, where political life had been dominated by such 
better organised forces as the Agrarian, Communist and other 
groups, formed on the basis of bureaucratic principles, Mityukov 
said.

  [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- Yuriy Chernichenko said that 
his Peasant Party supported Russia's Democratic Choice Party 
[RDCP]. 
  Chernichenko who spoke at the founding congress of the RDCP 
said that he would above all support its struggle against the 
insatiable appetites of the military-industrial complex. 
Pointing to the symbol of the RDCP - Falcone's famous monument 
to Peter the Great called the bronze horseman, he compared the 
military-industrial complex to the horseman, "who has grown so 
fat that it has crushed his horse and stripped it of what was 
left of its flesh." The state Duma "deceives itself and the 
country by endorsing an impossibly high military budget which 
make all reforms 'sluggish," he said. 
  Support for Russia's new political party has also been 
expressed by representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Japan and the Moderate Party of Sweden.

  [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "I will continue to fight 
for the observance of laws in Russia and I do not want this to 
be called a struggle against Yuriy Luzhkov," Anatoliy Chubays, 
vice-premier of the Russian Government and chairman of the State 
Property Management Committee, told a RIA correspondent during 
an intermission in the founding congress of Russia's Democratic 
Choice Party today. 
  It is to be remembered that President Yeltsin asked First 
Vice- Premier Oleg Soskovets to tell Chubays that he "should not 
have anything to do with Moscow." 
  Chubays promised to do all within "authority to punish those 
who violate laws regardless of their position. Time will show 
who wins. however, my attitude to privatisation Moscow style did 
not change after President Yeltsin's famous order," he said.

  Thus, the most convincing support for the government has 
come 
from Agrarian deputies, reflecting the interests of the 
kolkhoz-sovkhoz nomenklatura; from "Women of Russia," which 
mostly represents the leadership of traditional Soviet women's 
organizations; from Communists; from the PRUA, which in practice 
represents the interests of the federal and regional 
nomenklatura; and from the Zhirinovskiy party. 
  It is interesting that out of all the Agrarian deputies the 
only person to vote against the budget twice was Vice Premier A. 
Zaveryukha -- who, incidentally, has not taken part in a single 
other Duma vote and has even, it seems, not received his voting 
card. 
  In the other four factions listed above only 12 deputies did 
not once vote for the budget. 
  The only members of the "Russian Way" group never to vote 
for 
the budget were Komi Deputy N. Gen and Moscow region Deputy A. 
Muravyev, who is now said to be a member of the New Regional 
Policy group. 
  Within the Travkin party only S. Glazyev's small 
(five-person) grouping was opposed to ratification of the 
budget, believing that the government had not done enough to 
satisfy the military's interests. Among unaffiliated deputies 
the only person to align himself with this grouping directly was 
the pro-Rutskoy V. Lipitskiy -- the only one of the (seven) 
deputies to vote against on two occasions. 
  Hardline opposition to the government's draft budget was 
forthcoming only from "Yabloko" and "Russia's Choice" deputies, 
who think that the budget is too inflationary, takes no account 
of the needs of science, culture, education, health care, and so 
forth. The only person in the "Yabloko" faction to vote for the 
budget on second reading was M. Seslavinskiy, who is not 
formally a member of this faction but regularly takes part in 
its work. The only member of the "Russia's Choice" faction to 
twice vote for the budget was Deputy I. Starikov, who also 
regularly takes part in the work of the agrarian faction; while 
ministers (V. Danilov-Danilyan and Ye. Sidorov), three 
Chelyabinsk deputies (A. Pochinok, A. Kushnar, and V. Golovlev), 
G. Burbulis and S. Sulakshin (who have left the faction), and 
several other deputies voted once. 
  An analysis of the voting on the budget allows us to assert 
that the "hardline" opposition no longer has any need to create 
a coalition government, since such a government to all intents 
and purposes already exists.

  [Text] Moscow, June 20, RIA -- "Human rights do not exist 
without the freedom of speech and of the mass media." This was 
stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the 
conference -- "The Role and the Responsibility of the Mass Media 
in Democratic Process and the Development of Tolerance" -- that 
has opened in Moscow. 
  "Our recent history testifies that manipulation with the 
mass 
media and the creation of a kind of ministry of the truth, for 
instance in the form of an ideological department of the CPSU 
Central Committee, may considerably affect the sentiments of the 
people," pointed out the foreign minister. Today, too, such a 
mighty weapon as the mass media is not always treated with 
sufficient honesty and required dignity. 
  The minister pointed out that the mass media was often used 
to propagandise Russophobia and anti-semitism and to stir up 
national hatred. In many publications one can find ideas of 
nationalism and chauvinism. "It is a dangerous disease which 
cannot be left unnoticed," Kozyrev pointed out. He called for 
respectful relations between the authorities and the press. "We 
welcome well-reasoned, not ideologised, criticism, but we also 
want that journalists quote the speeches of officials more 
accurately, not distorting their words. However, they have the 
right to their own commentaries on the speech of any official," 
the minister said.

  [Text] Riga, June 15, RIA -- Beginning with July 1, the 
programmes of the Russian television channel will not be re- 
translated in Latvia. According to the sociological data, six 
percent of the Latvian citizens watched these programmes. 
  As to the Ostankino tv programmes (which are regularly 
watched by 48 percent of the population in Latvia), they will be 
broadcast only in the decimetre channel. As a RIA correspondent 
was told at the Latvian tv centre, the number of the people 
watching these programmes will thus decrease. 
  This decision has been taken by the Latvian Radio and 
Television Council which explains it by the Latvian law on 
television under which only a third of the tv time can be used 
for the programmes not in the official language, that is, in 
Russian, to be more precise. 
  According to the chairman of the Latvian Radio and 
Television 
Council, all these changes are an experiment and may possibly be 
revised next year.

<F P=106> [Report by Olga Nikitina, journalist and director of the </F>
Saratov Regional Environmental Committee: "Poisons at Shikany"] 
  [Excerpts] Who trusts it? Nobody, it seems -- at least 
when it comes to chemical weapons. Russia was one of the first 
countries to sign the convention to abolish chemical arsenals 
(on 13 January 1993), but the suspicions remain. Every other 
week the United States accuses it of having no intention of 
eliminating the arsenals but of in fact planning a superweapon. 
The decree with which Boris Yeltsin dismissed Anatoliy 
Kunzevich, chairman of the Chemical and Biological Weapons 
Affairs Committee, was not very reassuring. "He authorized the 
shipment of a dangerous load through an inhabited area," 
spokesmen explained. That was a mere pretext. Kunzevich 
(formerly director of the military laboratory at Shikany, which 
we discuss below) pointed out that the administrations of the 
places where the arsenals are located are refusing to grant the 
Army permission to get rid of the substances on the spot, so it 
is impossible to eliminate them. Even the Russians no longer 
trust Russia. There are many "converts" among scientists (we 
interviewed engineer Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov), and many local 
communities are prepared to mobilize. Meanwhile 40,000 tonnes 
of toxic substances lie in arsenals all over the country. Apart 
from nuclear weapons, they constitute the most colossal 
accumulation of means of destruction that exists on Earth at 
present. 
  The chemical history of Shikany -- an ancient possession of 
the Orlov-Denisov nobility in Volskiy province in the region of 
Saratov -- begins in 1924. [passage omitted] 
  After the war, Shikany, which has a population of 12,000, 
was 
divided into two parts. Shikany 1 is assigned to the Industry 
Ministry. It is the location of the State Institute for Organic 
Synthesis Technologies, housed in a small building. For the 
past 30 years it has been one of the main research centers into 
the most harmful substances for civilian applications. Shikany 
2 is the location of the Scientific Experiments Institute and 
the Defense Ministry's test range for weapons and chemical and 
radioactive defense methods. 
  After decades of experiments, nobody can say what has been 
absorbed by the grass and trees of this area, which covers 
almost 400 square km, nor what kind of deposits have formed at 
the bottom of the lake that is the source of the Bagayka stream, 
which debouches into the Volga. With regard to the Volga, which 
crosses the area, it should be kept in mind that on the opposite 
bank from Shikany 1 and 2 there lies the village of Gornyy, 
where the Army has located deposits containing over 1,000 tonnes 
of toxic substances. Although the military carries out regular 
checks, the conservation of these toxic substances has now 
become extremely dangerous; the deposits are old, the containers 
are no longer secure, and although the construction of a 
terminal to reduce the toxicity of the substances has been 
announced, it will take a long time yet. 
  All this information has emerged gradually from the 
population. After the statements by Vil Mirzayanov, a number of 
"betrayers of state secrets" emerged, some of them within the 
local authorities and among the technicians of the Shikany 
laboratories. The first was Vladimir Petrenko -- reserve major 
and member of the local council -- who recounted how in the past 
he had allowed the effects of certain substances to be tested on 
himself; he was followed by Vladimir Uglev, a chemical engineer 
at Shikany, who defended Mirzayanov. Then the inhabitants of 
the area formed a movement "Against the Chemical Threat," to 
protest their position of hostages of the military industry. 
  All this brought about a new awareness among the Russian 
public which, though more than justified, ultimately rebounded 
against us members of the Environmental Committee. As well as 
in the Saratov region, there are major deposits of chemical 
substances also in Chuvasha and Udmurtia. It seemed clear to us 
that these substances must be rendered harmless or eliminated in 
their present locations and that such a burden could not be 
transferred to others. However, the republics of Chuvasha and 
Udmurtia have banned any elimination of chemical weapons on 
their own territory. 
  So all that was left to the Saratov region was to dictate 
the 
conditions drawn up by the local authorities together with the 
regional environmental committee and a group of experts: to 
eliminate only the substances already present in the region; to 
draw up a plan for the social development of Gornyy and Shikany; 
to compensate all the inhabitants for the threat of 
environmental damage; to create a regional center to monitor 
work carried out against any pollution. These proposals were 
sent to the government and to Parliament, but no reply has yet 
been received. The inhabitants of the Saratov region remain 
alone with their anxieties. 
  Meanwhile, the experimental scientific center at Shikany 
has also fallen victim to the economic crisis. In February it 
ceased its activities, offering its staff a choice between 
seeking another job or taking an enforced vacation. Since staff 
had not received their wages since December, there was an 
immediate "exodus": Of the 2,500 staff, there are now only 
1,500 left. Apart from unemployment, the inhabitants of Shikany 
have also discovered that they are "prisoners" of the Defense 
Ministry, which owns almost one-third of the entire province. 
It is therefore forbidden to privatize either the land for 
farming or the apartments. For the same reason it is forbidden 
to construct private factories or workshops that could provide 
employment. 
  "Thank God," Nadezhda Saratov, mayor of Shikany, said, "the 
Defense Ministry still has the money to pay the wages of the 
staff at Shikany 2. But it is impossible to distinguish the two 
halves of the town, even though they are in the charge of 
different ministries: The people are the same and so are their 
problems, and they all share the same anxiety about how the 
elimination of the chemical deposits will take place." 
  Last summer many inhabitants of Shikany and the surrounding 
area reported skin infections, especially those who were 
outdoors when it rained. In February six soldiers serving at 
Shikany 2 were admitted to hospital with pulmonary edema. 
Fortunately they all survived. 
  It may be just a coincidence, but the inhabitants of Shikany 
are now accustomed to being suspicious. They therefore 
immediately connected these events with the fact that the 
"chemical friendship" with the Germans has been revived. A new 
agreement has been signed between Russia and Germany, and 
Germany has already sent to the area a mobile laboratory and 
complete equipment for eliminating the toxic substances. Many 
years ago the Germans helped us to create chemicals for death, 
and now they want to help us to eliminate them. In 1915 they 
tried to use gas on the river Ypr, now it seems that all toxic 
substances must end up on the banks of the Volga. According to 
incomplete data, along the banks of our great river there are 29 
centers for the production of chemical weapons, nine test 
ranges, and 24 deposits. Who will help us to eliminate this 
evil force?

  [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- "A considerable part of 
documents on the clearing up of radiological waste dumps in 
Moscow was lost, following the dissolution of architecture 
departments at the former district executive committees," said 
Sergey Okhrimenko, head of the department monitoring the sources 
of ionizing irradiation at the State Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Inspectorate. 
  Since the 1970s large-scale projects were carried out in 
Moscow to reveal and eliminate radioactive landfills. In all, 
1,200 such landfills grounds were revealed, most of them in 
south and south- east Moscow. Now that a part of documents has 
been lost, the sites of these landfills, the volume of work 
carried out to clear them up and the composition of isotopes 
influencing changes in the radiation level, are not known. 
There is a danger of radioactive contamination, especially 
during new residential construction. Okhrimenko said that they 
are drafting a special document, called ecological passport of 
residential and public construction, according to which a 
package of geological inspection and anti- radiation measures 
should be carried out in sites of potential residential 
construction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian chemical weapons expert Vil </F>
Sultanovich Mirzayanov by Fulvio Scaglione; place, date not 
given: "Factories Akin to Gulags"] 
  [Text] Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov, 59, married to a poetess 
and the father of two children, is a repentant scientist. After 
working for almost 30 years at Moscow's Organic Chemistry 
Research Institute -- a secret apparatus which is part of the 
military complex -- Mirzayanov has now launched a campaign 
against chemical weapons. With his colleague Lev Fedorov he 
published a number of articles which led to his arrest, his 
indictment for "divulging state secrets," and finally his 
release due to the authorities' manifest embarrassment. 
Mirzayanov lives with his family on the outskirts of Moscow in 
two poorly furnished rooms, on a 60,000-rouble [R] pension. At 
the time of his arrest, he was selling cheap shirts in the 
street. Chemical weapons did not make him rich. 
  [Scaglione] Doctor Mirzayanov, how does a brilliant 
researcher become an inventor of awesome weapons? 
  [Mirzayanov] In 1965, when I joined the institute, certain 
material considerations carried considerable weight. If I had 
remained at the Science Academy, I could never have afforded to 
rent this apartment in a cooperative. Wages were higher; a 
researcher with my grade earned R280 a month at that time. At 
the institute I earned R500, I got free meals in the canteen, I 
got two months' vacation instead of just one. In short, it was 
advantageous. On the other hand, it was almost like being in a 
gulag: very strict security regulations, checks, punishment for 
even very small transgressions. I even needed a special permit 
to go to the Lenin library, and if by any chance I had been 
fired, I would have found it almost impossible to find another 
job. 
  [Scaglione] What were your specific duties? 
  [Mirzayanov] For many years I was involved in producing 
weapons as an expert in the processes whereby the various 
substances are absorbed. Then, in the last period, I was 
responsible for safety checks in the various laboratories and 
plants. 
  [Scaglione] Did you often observe incidents or violations of 
the safety regulations? 
  [Mirzayanov] I recorded about 100 such "incidents." In 1987, 
when I informed the institute's management, a huge scandal broke 
out. I was even summoned by Chemical Industry Deputy Minister 
Golubkov [as published], who reprimanded me and warned me not to 
overstep my authority. They cared nothing about the 
consequences -- whether for the environment or for people -- of 
what I had seen. Their only fear was that information might be 
leaked outside. 
  [Scaglione] What led you to criticize and attack the world 
in 
which you lived and worked for so many years? 
  [Mirzayanov] Because signing the chemical disarmament treaty 
is mere hypocrisy, an empty gesture which not only leaves 
problems unresolved but actually worsens them. 
  [Scaglione] So do you also believe that new chemical weapons 
are being prepared in Russian laboratories? 
  [Mirzayanov] No, I do not believe so. Especially because it 
is not necessary to do so. In the first place, the convention 
does not prohibit research and, in the military field, the 
dividing line between research and production is very thin, far 
too thin. Besides, there is no need to build special factories 
or special chemical weapons. All you need is, for example, a 
laboratory producing a given pesticide in Siberia and another 
plant in Moscow producing a second pesticide. There is nothing 
irregular about that. Even the technicians involved believe 
that everything is all right. However, in a third laboratory, 
kept secret from everybody, a military scientist studies a 
formula, develops a synthesis of the two substances, and the 
result is a third substance, ready to be used as a weapon. You 
must bear in mind that certain chemical syntheses take place in 
a few seconds, a shorter time than it takes for a missile to fly 
from one country to another. Thousands of such syntheses are 
possible without ipso facto violating the convention. 
  [Scaglione] What about the disposal and destruction of the 
substances which have already been accumulated in laboratories 
and storage facilities? 
  [Mirzayanov] That is another great scandal. Russia signed 
the convention knowing very well that it could not dispose of 
its own reserves, or that it could only do so by exposing the 
population to very serious risks. According to my estimates, 
700,000 tonnes of various types of aggressive substances were 
produced overall in the Soviet period. But let us assume 
smaller estimates, like the ones accepted even in official 
scientific circles, where they speak of 400,000 tonnes only. 
Today the Russian authorities admit that they still have to 
dispose of 40,000 tonnes, which means that 360,000 tons have 
been buried, dumped, or hidden somewhere in a makeshift and 
dangerous way -- which, in any case, represents a greater hazard 
than the 40,000 tonnes which, somehow or other, are still stored 
in the old facilities. 
  [Scaglione] Where do you think the missing tonnes might be? 
  [Mirzayanov] It seems reasonable to think that they were 
disposed of not far from the production centers, i.e. in the 
Bryansk region, in Shikany, Kurgan, in Russia's great northern 
region. There are plants in Cheboksary and Volgograd, but in the 
fifties certain substances were also being manufactured near 
Moscow, in Kazan, Dzerdzhinsk, and other towns. 
  [Scaglione] What do you make of General Kuntsevich's sudden 
dismissal? 
  [Mirzayanov] I met him in the seventies -- as a matter of 
fact in Shikany, where I was sent several times on assignments. 
At that time Kuntsevich was still only a colonel and had only 
recently arrived in Shikany as head of the research center, 
after being posted for a long time in the Far East. Kuntsevich 
never worked much in the laboratories. He is a technocrat 
rather than a scientist, even though he became a general by 
implementing production of the so-called VX-33 chemical weapon 
in the Cheboksary laboratories. I know that for some time now 
he has been out of favor in military circles: They blame him 
for signing the convention. Perhaps my campaign did the rest, 
offering the "hawks" a good excuse to fire him.

  [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- The complement of officers in 
the Russian military in 1994 is 4.3 per cent less than a year 
ago, Deputy Defense Minister Valeriy Mironov told the State 
Duma's Defense Committee members today, which means the Army is 
90,000 officers and over 91,000 NCOs short. Col.-Gen. Mironov 
said that every third officer released from the ranks last year 
was under 30 years of age. More experienced officers under 40 
were resigning for want of perspective - 43 per cent of the 
total. 
  One trend is to discharge cadets right before the contract- 
signing: a half of all cadets discharged from military academies. 
  Gen. Mironov cited several reasons for the situation: low 
social security, low pay, and subsequent disillusionment in the 
chosen vocation.

  [Text] Moscow, June 3, RIA -- "The Russian 
military-industrial complex is in a terrible plight," said 
Nikolay Zinovyev, secretary of the Executive Committee of the 
association of Trade Unions of the Defence Industry, addressing 
a news conference here. He told reporters that as of the end of 
May the defence industry received from the state only 5 of [as 
received] the amount meant for fulfilling this year's state 
order, with four trillion rubles still due to it. If the 
current rate of recession in production persists (48.7 last 
April), defence-industry plants will have turned out this year 
five times fewer military and two times fewer civilian products 
than in 1991. 
  Nevertheless, Zinovyev believes, the military-industrial 
complex has possibilities of overcoming the crisis. It is 
essential to modify the military budget, bringing it into line 
with the state order. The slender means available to the 
defence industry can be substantially boosted by stepping up the 
export of military equipment. 
  Zinovyev reaffirmed the readiness of defence-industry 
workers 
to take on June 9 a collective action of protest against the 
industry's disintegration. Many enterprises of the 
military-industrial complex are to stop work for 10 to 15 
minutes, accompanying such a mini- strike by hooting.

  [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- The federal authorities of 
Russia are taking no timely and effective action to stabilise 
the socio- political situation in the north-Caucasian region. 
So says the appeal by the Forum of North Caucasian Mass 
Organisations and Movements and Cossacks to the president, 
prime-minister and speakers of both parliamentary chambers of 
the Russian Federation. The forum took place in Nazran. 
  In the opinion of its participants, the Russian leaders 
should proceed from an all-round analysis of the causes of 
inter-ethnic conflicts, to be conducted by well-trained and 
civic-minded experts. 
  The appeal expresses the hope that wisdom and foresight of 
Russian politicians and statesmen will enable them to make a 
profound estimation of the conditions in the northern Caucasus 
and take effective political, economic and legal measures aimed 
at stabilisation.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, June 15 RIA -- A special 17-man strong 
investigatory group of the public prosecutor's office and the 
Ministry of the Interior of Northern Ossetia continue their 
search of six Ingush hostages taken on May 19 in a suburb of 
Vladikavkaz, the RIA correspondent was told by Colonel Taimuraz 
Gamosov, head of the Leninskiy District Department of Interior 
Affairs of the republic. Gamosov said that the round-up carried 
out by the police in practically the entire republic had not 
yielded any results. According to Gamosov, two chief witnesses 
of the seizure of hostages, who could clear up a lot of things 
(possibly even disclose their whereabouts) are currently hiding 
for unknown reasons. Both are guards of economic facilities in 
Northern Ossetia. 
  According to T. Gamosov's version, "the witnesses do not 
want 
to be involved in the complex intrigues that are woven today in 
the state-of-emergency zone around the Ingush hostages, while 
the destiny of the Ossetian hostages taken back on March 30 does 
not interest anybody.

<F P=106> [Report by David Makovsky] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ukraine has offered to sell Israel missile- 
launchers for Israeli satellites, participants in a meeting 
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres said in Kiev yesterday. 
  Peres said Israel would consider the offer. 
  Amid a dispute over the Jewish Agency's aliya activities in 
Ukraine, Peres and Ukrainian leaders agreed yesterday to set up 
cultural centers in each other's countries. [passage omitted] 
  Peres told reporters yesterday that while anti-Semitic 
incidents have occurred in Ukraine, he was convinced that 
Ukrainian leaders were genuinely trying to combat this 
phenomenon. 
  In his talks in Kiev yesterday, Peres' Ukrainian counterpart 
also suggested that the two countries establish consulates in 
Haifa and Odessa. Ukrainian leaders also extended invitations 
both to President 'Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
to visit Kiev. 
  Bilateral agreements were signed in the areas of investment, 
taxation, police, science, and culture. [passage omitted] 
  [A report by Hemi Shalev on page 12 of Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in 
Hebrew on 16 June adds: "Ukraine offered to try to use its good 
relations with Damascus to create yet another channel of 
communications between Israel and Syria. 
  ["Ukrainian President Kravchuk told Peres that his country 
considers Israel `a strategic neighbor,' and that he hoped the 
agreements Peres will sign today would provide `a firm legal 
basis' to the relations between the two countries." 
  [The report notes that Peres complained to his Ukrainian 
counterpart about Ukraine's votes in the United Nations and 
other international organizations, and that the Ukrainian 
foreign minister replied: "I never dreamed that I would be 
hosting in Kiev an Israeli foreign minister who would voice his 
complaints and would also manage to convince me. You must 
understand that getting used to our independence and getting 
over the past takes time."]

  [Text] Moscow, June 16, RIA -- "The situation on the 
peninsula in general is quiet and business-like," Pyotr 
Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser on military 
questions, told RIA in a telephone talk. The Crimeans, he said, 
follow their President Yuriy Meshkov's stay in Switzerland as he 
attends the Crano-Montana forum dealing with trade between West 
and East. The Crimeans' interest in this forum is quite 
understandable as one of its plenary sessions will discuss the 
theme "the security of the Black Sea and the future of the 
Crimea". 
  In the words of the adviser, Ukrainian Speaker Aleksandr 
Moroz is arriving today in the Crimea. Meshkov's adviser says 
he is expected to participate in the plenary session of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet.

  [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- Ukraine is increasing the 
number of the units of its national guards in the Crimea. Petr 
Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser for military 
affairs, said this in his telephone conversation with a RIA 
correspondent. As has become known just now, he said, the units 
of the Ukrainian national guards have been deployed in 
Yevpatoria and Kerch though this act contradicts the decrees by 
Leonid Kravchuk of April 14 and 26, this year. According to 
these decrees, the Ukrainian national guards should be deployed 
only in Simferopol and Sevastopol. 
  According to the recent data, said the Crimean president's 
adviser, the national guards regiment is being transformed into 
a brigade. 
  Petr Chernyatevich asserts that the Ukrainian authorities 
have not given up their attempts to split the Crimean interior 
forces. They are conducting psychological pressure on them with 
the aim of winning over at least part of the militia personnel 
to their side. 
  The Crimean president's adviser said that this work is 
headed 
by Ukrainian Deputy Interior Minister Nedrigailo. However, the 
local militia are still devoted to the legally elected Crimean 
government.

chairman of the Crimean Parliament, and Vladimir Butkevich, head 
of the Ukrainian Parliament's Human Rights Commission, told RIA 
that the negotiations had been conducted in a friendly and 
constructive atmosphere. 
  It has been decided to resume the activities of the working 
group shortly and invite experts on legal and economic issues to 
take part in the discussion of specific problems. The deadline

  [Text] Moscow, June 6, RIA -- "The situation in Simferopol 
is gradually normalising," Petr Chernyatevich, adviser to the 
Crimean president on military issues, has told a RIA 
correspondent in a telephone interview. Barricades and tents 
outside the Supreme Soviet have been removed. The traditional 
day of the city was held here yesterday and was a great success. 
  According to the presidential adviser, the fact that the 
Crimean Tatars have captured two 9-storey buildings in Yalta 
causes a certain worry. Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet, left for Yalta today on a fact-finding 
mission to further report the situation to the parliament. 
  Mr. Chernyatevich has noted that the Crimea has received 
information about a collegium of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry 
held in Kiev. The collegium discussed the findings of the 
inspection of the 32nd Ukrainian Army Corps stationed in the 
Crimea. There is no information about the findings of the 
inspection, but as is known, a new inspection will be held this 
autumn.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, June 8, RIA -- The latest session of 
the Council of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly started with 
the raising of the flag of a new, 10th assembly member -- 
Moldova. 
  The participants in the session extensively discuss the 
question of the assembly's peace-making efforts. Information on 
this issue has been provided by the head of the assembly's 
peace-keeping group, the speaker of the parliament of Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan], Medetkan Sheremkulov. The delegates have also 
been briefed by the Russian president's special envoy for 
Nagorno-Karabakh, Ambassador at Large Vladimir Kazimirov. 
According to him, "peace that has been achieved is still very 
fragile and maximalism in the settlement of this 6- year-old 
conflict is hardly a good idea." 
  It is expected that in the course of the day the parliament 
leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan will discuss the prospects for 
the settlement of the Karabakh conflict.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9, RIA -- Russia and Moldova still have 
some differences on the time-table for the withdrawal of the 
Russian 14th Army from that republic. The issue was discussed 
at a press conference on the 9th round of the Russian-Moldovan 
talks in Moscow Wednesday. 
  Ambassador at large Vladimir Kitayev, chief Russian 
negotiator, said that in the estimates of military experts the 
process would take about 4 years, or slightly less. Nicolae 
Osmokescu, first deputy foreign minister of Moldova, who heads 
the Moldovan delegation at the talks indicated that in 
accordance with the official position of his country, the 14th 
Army should be withdrawn no later than December 31, 1995-January 
1, 1996. The heads of the two delegations confirmed that 
certain understanding had been reached on the issue, and the 
discussion of the timetable would be continued at the next 
round. This is the only disagreement which divides the parties 
working on the legal status, procedure and timeframe for the 
withdrawal of the Russian troops temporarily stationed in 
Moldova. The two sides said that certain progress recently 
achieved in the Transdniester settlement. Similarly, progress 
has been recorded in the efforts at finalising other documents 
complementing the main agreement.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9, RIA -- Another crew will be sent to 
the Mir orbiter on July 1, a spokesman for the Russian Space 
Agency [RSA] told RIA. However, some difficulties related to 
the citizenship of one of the cosmonauts arose during the 
preparations for the mission. Dalgat Musabayev, 43, is a 
lieutenant colonel of the Russian air Force, he is also a 
Russian citizen and has lived in Star City for quite some time. 
Meanwhile, representatives of Kazakhstan insist that Musabayev 
go to space as a Kazakh citizen. According to the Russian Space 
Agency spokesman the request of Kazakhstan will be granted. 
  There are plans to launch a Russian-Kazakh crew from the 
Baykonur spaceport on July 1. Dalgat Musabayev will fly 
together with Major Yuriy Malashenko, 33. During the four 
months he will stay on the orbit, Musabayev will perform a 
number of experiments, including those under the national space 
programme of Kazakhstan. Asked about the payment for the stay 
aboard the Mir spacecraft, the RSA spokesman said that 
Kazakhstan will probably withhold this amount due from the lease 
payment Russia makes for the use of the Baykonur spaceport. The 
amount which Kazakhstan will pay for Musabayev's involvement in 
the mir mission has not been disclosed. A well- informed 
sources told RIA that the sum may be reduced, considering the 
fact that Kazakhstan and Russia have common interest in the 
outer space. 
  As a rule, a one-week flight for a foreign cosmonaut on a 
Russian orbiter cost about 10 million dollars.

  [Text] Bishkek, June 10, RIA -- A representative NATO 
delegation, headed by General P. Karstens, supreme allied 
commander Europe, intends to visit the air force base in the 
Kirghiz [Kyrgyz] capital and aviation units in the suburbs of 
Bishkek. The delegation arrived in the republic yesterday 
evening. 
  According to the official version of the Kirghiz Defence 
Ministry's press centre, during its meetings with the republican 
leadership and with the heads of the Defence Ministry, the sides 
will discuss the prospects of the development of equitable and 
mutually advantageous relations and business contacts. 
  However, some local observers assert that one of the 
subjects 
of the discussions will be the deployment of an air force base 
of the Atlantic bloc in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan]. This explains 
the delegation's interest in aviation installations.

  [Text] Moscow, June 8, RIA -- About half a million Russians 
live now in Azerbaijan and not more than 50,000 people have left 
the republic over the years of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. RIA 
has learnt these figures from Irshad Aliyev, chairman of the 
State Committee of Azerbaijan on Refugees and Forced 
Re-settlers, who is now attending the Moscow international 
conference on refugees on the territory of the former USSR. 
"There have never been calls in Baku to drive away Russians 
from our republic," stressed Irshad Aliyev. 
  He referred to the problem of refugees and forced resettlers 
as "the most tragic consequence" of the 6-year-long war between 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. At the beginning of 1994, Azerbaijan 
registered over a million migrants, including more than 200,000 
Azeris and Muslim Kurds evicted from Armenia. 
  Refugees in Azerbaijan receive help not only from the Azeri 
Government but also from other countries, including Russia, as 
well as the UN, noted Irshad Aliyev.

  [Text] Tbilisi (DPA) -- Georgian head of state Eduard 
Shevardnadze unreservedly supports Russia's decision to send 
peace troops to Abkhazia, which is striving for more 
independence from Georgia. "The implementation of this 
operation is the logical continuation of the consolidation of 
our relations with Russia," Shevardnadze said in a DPA interview 
in Tbilisi on Tuesday. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy 
Kondratyev stated in Moscow that President Boris Yeltsin ordered 
the beginning of the operation on Tuesday. 
  The Russian soldiers are first supposed to remove the mines 
that had been planted during the fighting between Georgia and 
Abkhazia -- an autonomous region at the Georgian Black Sea coast 
-- last summer, Shevardnadze said. "This establishes security 
guarantees, not only for the entry of the peace troops, but also 
for the return of the refugees." 
  According to his information, altogether three Russian 
battalions are to be stationed in the districts of Gali and 
Ochamchire. In the first stage of the operation the employment 
of up to 1,500 soldiers is planned. "The peace operation will 
be restricted to the troop withdrawal," he stressed. 
  "I already said some years ago: The real sun rises for 
Georgia in the north," said Shevardnadze, "without Russia, we 
also do not have the best opportunities today to save ourselves 
and our state, which is being developed." "The most important 
thing is that Georgia must not wage war and has to learn to 
solve problems exclusively by peaceful means. Taking all 
present factors into account, this is only possible with 
Russia's active participation, as our bitter experiences show."

  [Text] Moscow, June 15 RIA--The leadership of Russia 
believes that the beginning of Russia's peacekeeping operation 
in Abkhazia will accelerate the settlement of the conflict 
situation in the region, Georgian Ambassador to Russia Valeryan 
Advadze declared in an exclusive interview given to a RIA 
correspondent. 
  As is known, on Tuesday the Russian president took a 
decision 
on the start of the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. In 
accordance with the presidential decree the peacekeeping action 
begins today and will be carried out by the efforts of units of 
the Russian forces deployed in Transcaucasia. It is expected 
that during this week they will take up positions on the line of 
disengagement from both sides of the Inguri River. 
  "All this once again confirms that the main key to solving 
the Abkhazian problem lies in the hands of Moscow, which head of 
the Republic of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze has repeatedly 
asserted," noted the Georgian ambassador. In his opinion, the 
fact that in Russia both the politicians and the military have 
got down to the settlement of the conflict is evidence of the 
peacekeeping potential of Russia in terms of solving conflict 
situations on the territory of the former USSR.

called on the CIS heads of state to consider it from the 
viewpoint of what is good for their peoples. They supported the 
proposal made by Ryzhkov that a CIS parliament had to be set up.

<F P=106> [Irakli Aladashvili article: "Caucasus -- the Wars </F>
Continue"] 
  [Text] Russia has completed the latest stage of its policy 
in the Transcaucasus. Russia's peacekeeping forces are ready to 
take up positions on the Inguri River [Abkhazia] and along the 
front line of confrontation between Armenian and Azeri military 
units. 
  Two to three years ago, Russia transferred quite a large 
amount of weapons to those countries involved in the current 
wars in the Transcaucasus. The reason for this was simple: The 
opposing sides would cause great damage to one another with the 
transferred weapons and then the Russian Army would directly 
intervene in events. 
  The plan has, for all intents and purposes, succeeded. A new 
stage of subjugation is beginning in the Transcaucasus although 
certain facts could change the scenario somewhat. 
  In spite of six years of bloody battles, both Azerbaijan and 
Armenia still possess a large amount of military equipment and 
armaments.

  Su-24 tactical bomber and reconnaissance aircraft -- 
seven; 
  Su-25 assault aircraft -- three; 
  Su-17 fighter-bomber aircraft -- two; 
  Mi-24 assault helicopter -- six. 
  This data is based upon that of independent foreign military 
experts (although it is not excluded that, as a result of 
wide-scale hostilities during the last few weeks, certain 
changes have occurred). 
  One assumes that Azerbaijan will not reconcile itself to the 
occupation of a large part of its territory by Armenia's Armed 
Forces, whereas Armenia will try in every way possible to 
maintain a buffer zone along the border with Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  A cessation of hostilities in the war in southern Azerbaijan 
is unlikely in the near future; the large amount of combat 
equipment gives one grounds to assume that a big war is yet to 
come.

  [Text] The joint Russian-American military exercises slated 
for early next month in southern Russia in the area of the city 
of Orenburg have been cancelled. This was disclosed today by a 
spokesmen for the two sides. 
  Vladimir (Nikonorov), a spokesman for the Russian Defense 
Ministry, said that the cancellation was not his ministry's 
fault but was due to the resolution adopted by the Russian 
parliament's lower house, the State Duma. In his words, the 
Russian Government yielded to the pressure, although the idea 
itself had not been rejected. 
  Spokesman for the United States embassy in Moscow, Michael 
McClellan, said the joint exercises are postponed and work is 
currently underway to determine a fresh date. He expressed hope 
that these would still take place in Russia elsewhere, possibly 
in autumn.

"FBI Chief To Visit Us"] 
  [Text] FBI Director Louis Freeh will be visiting Moscow 
from 3 through 6 July (incidentally, he will also celebrate 
American Independence Day here) at the official invitation of 
Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin. During the visit he 
will take in various Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] structures, the Russian Justice Ministry, the 
General Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, and the Foreign Ministry with his assistants and 
advisers, and will also be talking to students at the MVD 
Academy. The signing of a protocol on opening an official FBI 
office in Moscow is also scheduled. The "G-men" will have their 
own office on a floor of the U.S. Embassy equipped with the most 
modern methods of communicating with Washington. 
  "We have been on friendly terms with the FBI for three years 
now," Mikhail Yegorov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime, said. "We are 
cooperating in the fight against the mafia, which operates in 
both Russia and the United States. Currently our administration 
is pursuing over 30 criminal cases with the FBI -- we are 
investigating the activity of 30 Russian criminal groups closely 
linked to the American mafia, mainly in the sphere of major 
financial irregularities. We are looking for both the criminals 
and 'dirty' money leaving our country. In Moscow we will 
discuss tactics for joint work and summarize the results of what 
has been done." 
  The upcoming meeting is not the first in the history of the 
MVD and FBI. There were such meetings the year before last and 
last year, and this past winter Yegorov "went to the States 
himself."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington June 21 TASS -- The establishment of a 
Russian-American petroleum club -- a new nongovernmental and 
nonprofit organisation -- was announced by Yuriy Shafranik, 
Russian minister of fuel and power, here on Monday. 
  This organisation will promote an accelerated development of 
Russia's petroleum sector and establish cooperation between 
Russian and American companies, Shafranik told ITAR-TASS. 
  One of the main tasks of the club will be to establish 
direct 
contacts between large petroleum companies of the two countries, 
which will render unnecessary go-betweens which quite often only 
discredit joint projects, he said. 
  "Yet another project which, I hope, will be discussed within 
the framework of the club envisages transition from the sale of 
American oil-well equipment to Russia to its manufacture in our 
country. 
  "With the availability of relatively small financial 
resources, the Russian side can turn out a very large array of 
such equipment at defence-industry enterprises subject to 
conversion to civilian production. Large American petroleum 
companies support this idea," the minister said. 
  Final details of the work and organisational structure of 
the 
club are to be discussed in the coming days within the framework 
of the Russian-U.S. intergovernmental commission for economic 
and technological cooperation, Shafranik emphasised. 
  The club is expected to include directors of petroleum and 
investment companies of the two countries. Its headquarters is 
to be in Moscow and its missions will be located both in Russia 
and the U.S. 
  Shafranik also mentioned as very important events at the 
forthcoming session of the bilateral commission the final stage 
of discussion and a probable signing of an agreement under a 
Sakhalin-2 project which will for the first time give access to 
Russian oil- bearing shelves to an international consortium.

  [Text] Pyongyang will agree to former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter's plan concerning its nuclear program if a comprehensive 
solution is found to all other problems, North Korean Ambassador 
to Moscow Son Sung-pil told the State Duma's international 
affairs committee on Monday. 
  He said that after consultations in Pyongyang and a 
telephone 
conversation with Washington officials, Carter had unveiled a 
plan for a U.S. rejection of sanctions against North Korea and 
the resumption of bilateral talks broken off in March. 
Simultaneously, Son said, Washington has agreed to provide to 
North Korea a technology for a nuclear reactor working on light 
water. 
  If the plan works, North Korea will fully comply with the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty though IAEA's inspection of its 
nuclear installations will be impossible while the negotiations 
are under way, he said. 
  At the same time, the ambassador warned that his country 
would take proportionate, but strong measures in response to any 
international sanctions which would be seen as "a declaration of 
war and would respond accordingly." 
  On the Russian Foreign Ministry's initiative for an 
international conference on the issue, Son said his country had 
"a certain interest" in it. However, "we cannot accept it" if 
the forum is intended to try to bring pressure on North Korea, 
the ambassador said. 
  Son spoke of holding a series of talks with the Russian 
Foreign Ministry to try to get the details of the conference 
proposal.

"North Korea Has Promised `an Eye for an Eye...'"] 
  [Text] "We will respond to war with war! Our 
countermeasures will depend on the sanctions applied by the 
United States and other countries," Son Song-pil, North Korea's 
ambassador to Russia, declared yesterday at a session of the 
State Duma Committee for International Affairs. 
  The Korean representative called the whole Korean nuclear 
question "nuclear suspicions invented by the Americans," while 
the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, according 
to him, is "aimed at destroying North Korea's socialist system 
and the republic as a whole." 
  According to the ambassador's statement, North Korea wants 
to 
resolve the problem peacefully but, given the slightest pressure 
or threats from America or other states, Kim Il-song's country 
is prepared to counter one blow with another. 
  The DPRK's official representative took a great dislike to 
the Russian foreign minister's Friday Duma speech and to the 10 
June Kozyrev-Christopher joint news conference, at which the 
possibility of the simultaneous introduction of sanctions and 
holding of a peace conference on Korea was reported. 
  "There can be no question of simultaneous sanctions and a 
conference," Comrade Son Song-pil said, at the same time adding 
that the DPRK is seriously considering the Russian proposals and 
that meetings have already been held with representatives of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  According to the ambassador's report, during his stay in the 
DPRK ex-President Carter conveyed U.S. proposals which include 
the U.S. abandonment of sanctions, the provision of a light 
water reactor to the DPRK through third countries or through 
international organizations, and consent to a third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  "If these conditions are fulfilled, Korea is prepared to 
keep 
inspectors at the nuclear installations. But a full-scale 
inspection cannot be carried out during the talks, since this 
would signify the DPRK's return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty," the ambassador declared, resolutely emphasizing: "If 
the talks are held on our terms, the nuclear problem will be 
removed!"

  [Text] Eminent U.S. political scientist Robert Manning, 
who took part in drafting the Clinton administration's policy 
toward the DPRK, has advocated "closer" coordination of actions 
between the United States and Russia in settling the nuclear 
problem of North Korea. 
  "I am critical of the fact that the U.S. Administration has 
failed to consult more closely with Russia on the subject of the 
North Korean problem," he stated in an interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "Russia does not want nuclear weapons 
on the Korean peninsula, nor does it want war to break out as a 
result of the collapse of the North Korean regime." 
  The expert criticized the aims which the U.S. Administration 
is pursuing in respect of North Korea. In his view, the 
application of sanctions prior to presenting the North Koreans 
with a clearly crafted package of specific proposals would be a 
mistake.

  [Text] The Committee for International Affairs discussed 
the situation on the Korean peninsula at the Russian State Duma 
today. Son Sung-pil, the North Korean ambassador to Russia, 
spoke to deputies. 
  [Correspondent Ivan Trefilov] North Korea will meet war with 
war, and the specific measures will depend on the particular 
sanctions that the world community takes against the republic, 
the North Korean diplomat said. At the same time, the DPRK is 
willing to come to talks at any time and to settle the nuclear 
problem peacefully. In this connection, North Korea has 
manifested some interest in the proposal by the Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs for an international conference to be held on 
the nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula. However, if the 
conference is intended to bring pressure to bear, the DPRK will 
not be able to agree to this, the North Korean ambassador 
stressed. 
  In the diplomat's view, there has been some progress in 
settling the nuclear problem since the visit to the DPRK by 
former U.S. President Carter. The American visitor handed over 
an official U.S. proposal: the abandonment of sanctions; the 
supply to North Korea of light water reactors; and a third round 
of U.S.-DPRK talks. In return for this, the DPRK must retain 
international monitoring at its nuclear facilities. 
  In the view of the North Korean diplomat, this proposal 
could 
form the basis for a comprehensive settlement of the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula. 
  Ivan Trefilov, for Ekho Moskvy at the State Duma.

  [Text] Moscow, June 21 (YONHAP) -- North Korea will not 
accept full-scale international inspection of its nuclear 
facilities while talks with the United States are underway, a 
senior North Korean diplomat said Monday. 
  North Korean Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil, while 
explaining his country's position on the continuing nuclear row 
to members of the Russian State Duma (House of Representatives) 
Foreign Affairs Committee, said that international nuclear 
inspections would never be allowed until an across-the-board 
agreement on the issue was reached with the United States. 
  Pyongyang would not return to the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) should international organizations fail to withdraw 
their move toward sanctions against it, Son added. 
  Son said, "economic sanctions, if taken against North Korea, 
will be regarded as a declaration of war...we will counter war 
with war."

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yuriy Solton from the </F>
"Focus on Asia" program, entitled: "Signs for Easing Tensions 
Have Begun To Appear"] 
  [Text] In connection with the possibility of resolving the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, station commentator Yuriy 
Solton writes: 
  A series of new signs for bringing an end to tensions on the 
Korean peninsula have begun to appear. Former U.S. President 
Jimmy Carter's recent visit to Pyongyang was successful in this 
respect. 
  During meetings with him, DPRK President Kim Il-song made a 
series of important assurances. This is represented by 
Pyongyang's intention to let the International Atomic Energy 
Agency inspectors continue their work in this country's nuclear 
facilities. The DPRK also proposed that its nuclear program be 
frozen during the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and that 
North-South top-level talks be held. The response by Washington 
and Seoul to this overture was affirmative. However, some 
politicians of Washington and Tokyo expressed a variety of other 
views. Time will prove which view is correct. 
  However, what is clear today is a need not to hasten the 
implementation of sanctions. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who has well-informed sources, viewed that Pyongyang 
had no nuclear weapon. He also said that it would take three to 
seven years for it to do so. 
  Moscow worries that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] 
may be broken down. It worries so because in case one signatory 
withdraws from this treaty, there may be a chain reaction. The 
Russian foreign minister said that many other countries had been 
waiting for their turns. 
  Russia expressed its dissatisfaction at the United States, 
which had unilaterally and hastily distributed a draft 
resolution on sanctions in the UN Security Council. Such a 
resolution must include convening an international conference 
during which how to ensure a nuclear-free status on the Korean 
peninsula and ways to effectively ensure security in the North 
and South of Korea must be discussed. 
  The writer says: Today, when new signs for easing tensions 
on the peninsula have appeared, is convening such a meeting more 
practical than imposing sanctions?

  [Text] Moscow hopes that the second ministerial meeting for 
Bosnia is going to take place before the end of June. This was 
disclosed in a Monday interview with INTERFAX by a high-ranking 
official at the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  The G-7 summit in Naples at the beginning of July is the 
deadline before the foreign ministers of Russia, the USA, 
Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Belgium must get together, 
the official said. 
  The diplomat hopes that technical matters can be resolved in 
a matter of days and the working schedules of ministers 
coordinated. "There is a more difficult problem, though. All 
possible actions of each of the conflicting Bosnian sides must 
be predicted", he said. The international community should have 
something in store, if one or both conflicting sides reject the 
plan approved during the first ministerial meeting. 
  Under the plan Bosnian Serbs should get 49 percent of the 
territory and the federation of Muslims and Croats 51 percent. 
  The Russian diplomat felt that Geneva would again host the 
ministerial meeting. "The leaders of the conflicting sides will 
evidently also be invited to Geneva. It is not clear, however, 
whether they are going to attend the meeting or whether the 
ministers will find another way of communicating with them", the 
official said.

  [Text] Milan June 20 TASS -- "Russia and Europe, Russia and 
the world have the broadest prospects for the development of 
versatile economic and political cooperation. We cannot live 
without one another," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
said in his remarks at the opening ceremony of the 19th World 
Gas Congress here on Monday. 
  The Russian premier emphasised that Moscow expects specific 
proposals from the Group-of-Seven countries for cooperation in 
regulating flows of investments and elaborating adequate and 
specific mechanisms to encourage and insure them. 
  "Russia strives to be recognised a `country with a 
transitional economy' by partners for the forthcoming G-7 summit 
in Naples and expects G-7 countries to make new specific steps 
to improve conditions for Russian commodities' access to 
external markets," Chernomyrdin said. 
  "I am confident that the G-7 turning into a G-8 would lead 
to 
fundamentally important and positive changes in the geopolitical 
balance and create new favourable conditions for Russia's 
full-scale participation in the world economic system," 
Chernomyrdin pointed out. 
  The World Gas Congress is being attended by about 5,000 
delegates from 67 countries. They represent leading gas 
companies that determine gas-industry policy on a world scale. 
Russia, which now accounts for 36 percent of the world's 
reserves of natural gas holds a special place in this respect. 
Experts, politicians and diplomats, whom the Russian delegation 
meet at the congress, show a lively interest in the state of 
affairs in Russia. 
  Russia accounts for about 30 percent of the world's trade in 
gas, Chernomyrdin emphasised. The existence of large gas 
resources in eastern Siberia and on the Shelf of Sakhalin opens 
up possibilities for the export of gas to China, Japan, the 
Korean peninsula, the shipping of gas by tankers to the United 
States and other countries. Moscow is prepared to discuss 
proposals about foreign firms' participation in the development 
of gas and oil fields and in the construction of processing 
facilities, Chernomyrdin said. He pointed out the importance of 
reducing fuel losses during production and transportation, and 
described plans to build steam and gas-fired power stations in 
the European part of Russia. 
  Chernomyrdin toured the display stands of Gazprom and the 
Italian ENI fuel company at a specialised exhibition which has 
been timed for the World Gas Congress.

  [Text] Milan June 20 TASS--Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi met with visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin in Milan on Monday to discuss bilateral relations. 
  The meeting became one of the key events in Chernomyrdin's 
schedule. The Russian premier is in Milan to attend the World 
Gas Congress. 
  Chernomyrdin said that the "treaty of friendship and 
cooperation between Russia and Italy is ready for signing." It 
is time for the head of the Italian Government to visit Moscow, 
he said. 
  Chernomyrdin's talks with Berlusconi is the first contact of 
the Russian leadership with the new Italian premier. The 
meeting gave good opportunities for a free exchange of views on 
bilateral relations and international issues. 
  The talks between Chernomyrdin and Berlusconi have started a 
new stage in Russia's contacts with the leaders of the leading 
industrialised countries following recent meetings with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 
light of the upcoming G-7 summit meeting to be held in Naples in 
July which will be attended by Russia.

  [Text] Following the two hour long talks and a dinner 
reception at the sumptuous villa of the head of the Italian 
Government today, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists: 
Silvio Berlusconi is the most interesting man I have ever met. 
The conversation between the two men was very cordial and 
fruitful. Berlusconi accepted the invitation to come to Moscow 
on an official visit. In the course of the visit Russia and 
Italy will sign a friendship and cooperation treaty. According 
to Italian diplomats, the treaty envisages the kind of political 
and economic cooperation which Russia has only with Germany. 
Berlusconi assured Chernomyrdin that he would support Russia in 
her effort to join the group of seven developed nations, and 
generally do his very best to make Russia a leading country in 
the world scene. 
  In reply to the flattering remarks by Chernomyrdin, 
Berlusconi said that while engaging in personal cultural 
development he read more Russian than Italian writers. Today 
the Russian prime minister, who is now staying in Milan at the 
invitation of the Italian state oil company Eni, also took part 
in the 19th world congress on natural gas.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "Russia Is Not Forcing Its </F>
Way Into G-7, Viktor Chernomyrdin States on Departure for 
Washington"] 
  [Text] The Russian premier made this statement at the 
airport prior to his departure for Italy, from where, having 
completed his one-and-a-half-day visit, he is proceeding across 
the Atlantic to the United States as you are reading these lines. 
  The question of transforming the G-7 into the G-8 is one of 
the key questions at both the talks held with the head of the 
Italian Government, who we know will chair the June G-7 summit 
in Naples, and at meetings in Washington, where Chernomyrdin's 
interlocutors will include President William Clinton, albeit (as 
the situation stands at the time of the departure from Moscow) 
with the qualification of "conditionally." 
  From the Russian premier's viewpoint Russia has "already 
progressed a long way" regarding the question of whether it will 
add itself to the G-7. But the official formation of the G-8 is 
a matter for the future which goes beyond the bounds of the 
Naples summit. "I see no difficulties as regards political 
questions," Chernomyrdin said, answering my question. "As for 
economic questions, we are not forcing our way in, we are 
perfectly well aware that there are difficulties on which we 
ourselves have some work to do today." When these difficulties 
have been overcome is when, as far as can be understood from the 
premier's comments, the G-7 will become the G-8. "This," he 
stressed, "is the next stage." True, Chernomyrdin did not 
specify whether Moscow hopes to overcome this obstacle by next 
year's summit scheduled in Canada. 
  In Washington, to where the premier is flying to participate 
in the third session of the Russian-U.S. economic and technical 
commission, which he heads jointly with U.S. Vice President 
Albert Gore, our delegation will strongly raise a question which 
has gone unanswered for too long: When do the Americans and the 
West as a whole intend to finally lift the restrictions on 
business contacts with us which persist from Cold War times? 
Let me recall that at the summit meeting in Vancouver in April 
last year Clinton solemnly promised to do this without delay. 
Over a year has elapsed. "This is simply unsettling us all," 
Chernomyrdin said. "Not only us but also the Americans are 
losing out because the restrictions are being maintained.... We 
want to work on equal terms, we are not asking for anything that 
would make us an exception. We have wishes, like everyone. Of 
course, we will not tolerate discrimination against Russia." 
  Although the premier did state that he hopes that a solution 
will nonetheless be found, I personally have doubts as to how 
serious the Washington administration and U.S. Congress are 
about this. The doubts are strengthened, in particular, by the 
U.S. Department of Commerce's recent statement, which defined 
the 10 most promising emerging markets from the viewpoint of 
U.S. interests. This list includes Brazil, Indonesia, India, 
Turkey, South Korea, and Poland. But not Russia. In order to 
promote U.S. interests in Indonesia, for example, a special 
strategic group has already been formed which includes 
representatives of 22 ministries and departments. In other 
words, if we are talking about the level of interest shown by 
the Americans, Jakarta has reached a level which is still 
unachievable for Moscow. Let me add that in relation to China, 
which is also on this list, Washington is prepared to waive 
literally any of its principles, including those linked to 
guaranteeing civil rights and freedoms, so that it does not lose 
this market and becomes established and prevails in it. But as 
for us this attitude is once again something unrealistic. 
  It must be specially stressed that the mood of U.S. 
business circles plays a colossal role in the extent to which 
the Washington administration is complaisant in its dealings 
with Beijing. The fact that Clinton effectively ignored human 
rights violations by the Chinese authorities and is going to 
renew China's most-favored-nation trading status is indicative 
of the powerful pressure put on the White House by, among 
others, the Boeing aviation corporation, which, were it not for 
this status, could have lost tens of billions of dollars. Those 
meeting with Chernomyrdin in the United States -- who, besides 
Washington, will visit Detroit (in order, among other things, to 
support our team in the football World Cup) and Los Angeles and 
San Francisco -- will include leaders of Boeing and other U.S. 
aviation giants. I wonder to what extent they are going to want 
to mount an intensive campaign of pressure on the White House in 
order to break into Russian markets and open up U.S. markets for 
Russian products. 
  Another noteworthy point on the Russian premier's itinerary: 
the Livermore Laboratory, the very same one where the most 
advanced weapons, including nuclear and space weapons, have been 
and are still being developed. Chernomyrdin will become the 
first Russian of such high rank to visit this laboratory, in 
order -- as far as can be ascertained -- to thoroughly discuss 
questions of defense conversion and those about which he prefers 
not to talk for the moment. "We are discussing those problems," 
he just told me, "about which it was prohibited to think 
previously." It is to be hoped that some light will be shed on 
this subject as well by the end of the visit. 
  U.S. reporters who accompanied the premier to the airport 
asked a question which evidently interests U.S. politicians much 
more than the visit itself at the moment: Are there any 
differences of opinion between Chernomyrdin and Boris Yeltsin? 
The reply was categorical: "There are no differences between 
us. There were not any initially, there are none now, and there 
will be none. It is impossible to work in the midst of 
differences. The line being pursued by the government and 
president is a united line. I better than anyone else can 
confirm this today."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Pavel Vanichkin, Oleg Velichko </F>
and Vitaliy Chukseyev] 
  [Text] Washington June 21 TASS -- In the coming four days 
almost a half of Russian cabinet members, led by Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, will be in the United States attending a 
regular session, the third one, of the Russian-U.S. 
Intergovernmental Commission for Economic and Technological 
Cooperation. 
  The commission formed last year under the Vancouver accords 
reached by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton in spring 
1993, is co-chaired by U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore and 
Russian Premier Chernomyrdin who arrives in Washington on 
Tuesday from Milan where he attended the World Gas Congress. 
  The commission's session promises to be quite intensive and 
productive. The first two sessions were held in Washington and 
Moscow last year. 
  About twenty documents on bilateral cooperation in various 
fields are to be signed as a result of the session, Mikhail 
Tarasov, assistant to the Russian premier, told ITAR-TASS. 
  There is every indication that the most important one will 
be 
a package of agreements to integrate Russia into the 
international programme for the development of an Alpha space 
station. 
  It is expected in particular that during the session NASA 
and 
Russian Space Agency chiefs Daniel Golding and Yuriy Koptev will 
sign a contract worth a total of 400 million U.S. dollars for 
the operation of the Russian orbital station Mir during the 
first phase of the Alpha project. 
  A concept, worked out by the two countries' experts, of 
Russian participation in creating a new-generation orbital 
station has already been endorsed by all other participants in 
the programme, including space agencies of Europe, Japan and 
Canada. An agreement in principle has been reached in 
particular to launch a Russian power module in 1997, Tarasov 
said. 
  The Russian premier's assistant also spoke about the 
possibility that agreements will be signed to shut down reactors 
for the production of plutonium and cease using it for the 
production of nuclear weapons. However, Tarasov specified, 
there is no full confidence so far that such a document will be 
signed in the coming days because the sides still adhere to 
different approaches to the question of compensation for the 
regions where reactors subject to shutdown are located. 
  Much interest is being generated by the forthcoming meeting 
between Chernomyrdin and World Bank President Lewis Preston and 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Michael 
Camdessus. 
  It has become known from informed sources that the Russian 
premier's conversation with the World Bank president is expected 
to result in the signing of four agreements to grant credits to 
Russia amounting to a total about 800 million U.S. dollars. 
  According to preliminary information, no agreements are 
planned to be signed during the Chernonyrdin-Camdessus meeting. 
  However, informed sources told ITAR-TASS that the IMF chief 
recently spoke about the possibility of granting the IMF's 
so-called standard credit to Russia in the near future. It is 
precisely this matter that is expected to dominate the talks. 
  On June 23, on the final day of the commission's session, a 
meeting between Chernomyrdin and President Bill Clinton is to 
take place in the White House, with the Russian premier doing 
his best to persuade the U.S. President into granting Russia the 
status of country with a transitional market economy and finally 
abrogating the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the trade act. 
  The Chernomyrdin-Clinton meeting will also be an important 
stage of preparation for Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
forthcoming visit to the United States in autumn. 
  Apart from staying in the U.S. capital, Chernonyrdin is 
planning to visit Detroit, Michigan, to familiarise hinself with 
the operation of the General Motors technological centre on June 
24 and even test one of the newest vehicle models. 
  On the same day the Russian premier intends to attend a 
Russia- Sweden match at the World Cup finals.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Cooperation" rubric: </F>
"Speaker Flies Back From Germany. He Approves Struggle Against 
Gangsters"] 
  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, who has just returned from Germany, 
has reproached Boris Yeltsin for his failure to submit a bill on 
additions and amendments to the Criminal Procedural Code to the 
State Duma before issuing the edict on the struggle against 
gangsters was issued. The lower chamber could have "adopted 
such a law within one day," the speaker emphasized, calling the 
presidential edict "necessary." In so doing, he cited the 
experience of other countries and politicians in setting similar 
precedents, including that of the United States and Franklin 
Roosevelt, who would probably have turned in his grave from 
surprise, had he heard Mr. Rybkin's arguments. 
  It has become clear from the speaker's account of the State 
Duma mission's trip to Germany that it worked on matters of 
cooperation at three levels: European, interstate, and 
interparliamentary. At the meeting with Bundestag President 
Rita Suessmuth the two sides discussed cooperation within the 
Council of Europe and the CSCE. In particular, Mr. Rybkin 
pointed to the possibility that a conflict could have 
irreparable consequences because of the UN peacekeeping 
mechanism's unwieldiness, and spoke in favor of using the CSCE 
mandate in Europe's "hot spots." 
  As for interstate relations, the main event of the year will 
be the withdrawal of Russian troops in August. Mr. Rybkin 
pointed out that this matter is very sensitive for Russian 
public opinion, adding, however, that when he met with German 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe they managed to reach agreement on 
releasing the second part of the credit, sufficient to build 
28,000 apartments for Russian servicemen returning to their home 
country. The State Duma speaker believes that the pullout of 
the Russian troops will be followed by an upswing in 
Russian-German cooperation, because both sides are going through 
similar processes of renewal. 
  Strange as it might seem, Vladimir Lukin, chief of the 
Committee on International Affairs, was just as optimistic: In 
his view, a chill would not serve German interests. Thus both 
State Duma leaders echoed the opinion expressed by Helmut Kohl 
and Boris Yeltsin last May. Let us hope they are right.... 
  Communication between the parliaments will from now on also 
be maintained at the level of their internal structures: An 
operational plan of cooperation has been drawn up and direct 
contacts between State Duma committees on defense, international 
affairs, and organizational matters with their Bundestag 
counterparts are envisioned.

  [Text] Moscow June 20 ITAR-TASS -- A delegation from the 
lower house of the Russian parliament led by Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin returned home from Berlin on Monday. 
  On Sunday, Rybkin addressed representatives of the Berlin 
assembly of deputies in the castle of Charlottenburg. He said 
Russia and Federal Germany were both in the process of renewal, 
which, despite many differences, was much alike in both 
countries. This is particularly true about east Germany, which 
opens perspectives for cooperation and interaction. 
  Rybkin stressed that "cooperation with Germany is of great 
importance for us in the period of complex economic changes in 
Russia". 
  According to Reinhard Fuehrer, deputy chairman of the Berlin 
assembly, the visit of the Russian delegation is seen by the 
German side as a contribution to the development of current and 
the beginning of new contacts between the two states at the 
parliamentary level.

  [Text] On Monday the Russian Deputy Minister for Foreign 
Economic Relations Georgiy Gabunia told INTERFAX that Russia and 
the European Union have reached agreement on a draft treaty for 
partnership and cooperation and on Tuesday the document is 
expected to be formally approved by the EU Council. 
  President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of EU countries plan 
to sign the document in Corfu, Greece on Friday. 
  According to Gabunia, the package of documents related to 
the 
treaty, including a joint declaration and letters of exchange, 
consists of some 100 typewritten pages. Under the treaty the 
European Union will recognize Russia as a country with a 
transitional economy, not one with a state-run system of trade. 
  Gabunia said that talks on the agreement have been going on 
for two years. The section on trade in commodities has caused 
the greatest difficulties. The sides decided to offer each 
other most- favored-nation status in trade. The treaty has 
sections regulating business and investment activities, in 
particular the formation and operation of companies, the flow of 
capital and payments. It describes cooperation in finance, 
economy, culture and crime- prevention. 
  The implementation of the agreement will be controlled by a 
Cooperation Council formed of high-ranking government officials: 
ministers or deputy prime-ministers. Under the draft the 
council is to assemble onece a year. Routine control will be 
carried out by a Cooperation Committee consisting of officials 
of a lower rank and experts.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jun--When Andrey Kozyrev received Alexis 
Galanos, chairman of the Cypriot House of Representatives, at 
the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry on 20 June, he said that 
the development of Russian-Cypriot dialogue was "very active." 
The present round of a regular exchange of opinions, which is 
taking place with the participation of the representatives of 
both the executive and the legislative powers, followed the 
talks between the Russian foreign minister and Cypriot Foreign 
Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis, who visited Moscow during the 
first 10 days of June. 
  Kozyrev believes that the process of a comprehensive 
development of relations between the two countries is in keeping 
with the current "revival of spiritual and historical aims of 
Russia's foreign policy." Moscow and Nicosia have a similar 
point of view on many international problems. The head of the 
Russian diplomacy said, in particular, that they were going to 
continue providing assistance in the settlement of the Cypriot 
problem. In this instance, he said, the parties had a chance to 
compare their views and found out that their actions were 
similar. 
  Galina Sidorova, political adviser of the Russian minister, 
said to journalists that Nicosia acknowledged Moscow's positive 
role in the Cypriot settlement once again during the talks. One 
of the topics of conversation was a report prepared by the 
secretary general of the United Nations, which spells out all 
the aspects of the problem and proposes a plan of action that 
the world community could take in this matter. 
  According to her, Nicosia has taken a positive stance with 
regard to Russia's joining the Council of Europe. Beginning in 
November, Cyprus will be chairing the foreign ministers 
committee of the Council of Europe, and our partners have 
stressed their determination to facilitate this process.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo June 21 TASS -- Russia's Democratic Choice 
(RDC) party believes that the territorial problem in relations 
with Japan "is a long-term task which has no easy solutions", 
RDC chairman Yegor Gaydar told ITAR-TASS. He arrived in Tokyo 
on Monday for a private visit to discuss ways of cooperation 
between the RDC and Japan's largest opposition 
Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) and attend an international 
seminar on investment problems. He was due to meet with members 
of the LDP and Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership on Tuesday. 
  "While recognising the existence of a territorial problem, 
we 
consider that any approaches to its solution should be based on 
the results of the Russo-Japanese summit talks in Tokyo in 
autumn last year," Gaydar pointed out. He expressed an opinion 
that the problem could be resolved only when public consensus 
develops in Russia and Japan on how that could be done. 
  Touching upon the RDC's foreign contacts, Gaydar said the 
party intends to conclude cooperation agreements with a number 
of foreign parties, similar to that which was concluded with the 
Japanese Liberal-Democratic Party last week. 
  "Strengthening political ties with those political forces 
abroad, which are interested in a normal development of Russia, 
is an important element of our calm work to overcome xenophobia 
in Russia and to counter ideas, which are being spread in the 
country by some of our political opponents, about some 
conspiracy against Russia and her isolation in the world," 
Gaydar said. 
  "We attach much importance to developing contacts with Japan 
and regard the LPD as one of our serious and long-term 
partners," the RDC chairman pointed out. 
  "The conclusion of an agreement with the LDP is not linked 
with hopes to get financial support from it," he said. "We may 
not permit ourselves to make use of financial support from 
foreign political parties and intend to build our relations with 
them on the basis of equal partnership," Gaydar said. 
  The RDC chairman said "Russia will succeed in maintaining 
political stability within at least the next six months despite 
the existence of forces which are interested in destabilising 
the situation in the country".

<F P=106> [Mikhail Lantsman report in the "Lobby" column: "Duma </F>
Deputies Rise to the Defense of the Golan Heights. Near East Is 
Warned About U.S. Aggression"] 
  [Text] A group of State Duma deputies has warned of a 
dangerous course of events in the Near East threatening Russia's 
national interests. In a message to lower chamber speaker Ivan 
Rybkin and Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
the deputies analyzed the "true reasons" which prompted U.S. 
President Clinton's administration to force Israel to retreat 
from the Golan Heights captured in 1967. 
  The conclusions the deputies came to are worrying to Russia, 
Syria, and Israel. The strategic goal of a peaceful settlement 
according to the U.S. prescription, Duma deputies believe, is to 
turn the Golan Heights into a military base for the deployment 
of rapid reaction forces. As a result of this Israel will 
become totally dependent on the United States; Syria and other 
Arab countries, such as Egypt, will be included in the sphere of 
American policy while Russia, together with its great-power 
status, will lose lucrative arm markets. In order to avert the 
treacherous U.S. plans, the deputies asked the Russian Foreign 
Ministry to step up its influence on the process of peace 
settlement. The deputies believe that U.S. and Russian armed 
forces should be excluded from a possible UN peacekeeping 
contingent in the Golan Heights in the event that Israeli-Syrian 
accords are reached. 
  The group of defenders of the Golan Heights against U.S. 
expansion includes 33 deputies who signed the message. The 
signatories include Sergey Baburin, Viktor Ilyukhin, Yuriy 
Vlasov, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, and members of the communist faction 
and Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democrats. The drive is spearheaded 
by National Republican Party leader Nikolay Lysenko. 
  On 17 June the State Duma rejected Lysenko's proposal to 
include the Golan Heights issue on the agenda. Nonetheless the 
results of the voting (more than 80 in favor) showed that the 
number of Russian defenders of the Golan Heights has grown.

  [Text] The planned air-lifting of the personnel and 
materiel of two Russian peace-making battalions to the 
Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone will require 60 aircraft sorties. 
This was reported to INTERFAX on Monday by the command of the 
Russian military transport aviation. 
  Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes are to carry the 
battalions 
formed on the basis of two peace-making divisions stationed in 
Leningrad and Volga military districts. 
  At the Defence Ministry INTERFAX was told that two more 
battalions from the Russian contingent in the Caucasus are 
expected to enter the zone on their own vehicles. 
  Deputy Defence Minister Grigoriy Kondratyev denied reports 
about the possible participation in the operation to separate 
conflicting sides formations of the 345th Air-Borne Regiment 
stationed in Gudauta. He said the regiment would be used only 
for guarding the joint staff of the peacekeeping force in 
Sukhumi. 
  At the end of last week engineering units were transferred 
to 
Abkhazia, in particular sappers and a signal office. This 
required 15 flights of Ilyushin-76 and Antonov-22 planes. 
  Officials at the ministry stressed that this is only a 
preparatory stage of the peacekeeping operation: the area is 
being clear of mines and communications established between the 
staffs of the peacekeepers, Georgians and Abkhazians and the UN 
mission in Georgia. The operation to separate conflicting sides 
can begin only after the Russian Council of the Federation 
passes an appropriate resolution. The upper house of the 
Russian parliament is to discuss the matter on Tuesday.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents S. </F>
Kolosova, Igor Porshnev, and others] 
  [Text] The Duma's Speaker Ivan Rybkin has denounced as 
vicious the Baltic governments policy of violating the rights of 
ethnic minorities. The formation of states for just one 
privileged ethnic group has always involved violence, he said to 
a group of Russian journalists who accompanied a Russian 
parliamentary delegation on its official tour of Germany June 
15-19. 
  He reported that the issue on human rights in the Baltic 
states had been repeatedly raised during the visit. "Russian 
lawmakers believe it's inadmissible to connive with the flagrant 
violation of the civil rights of ethnic minorities in the Baltic 
republics, and the influence of Germany on this matter could be 
significant," he remarked. 
  In his words, although ethnic Russians, in fact, make up the 
majority of the populace in such Estonian towns as Kohtla-Jarva, 
Narva, and Sillamae, they have no representatives in parliament. 
Nor do they have any say in local decision making. 
  He reported that the German side had voiced some anxiety at 
the Russian peace-keepers deployment in Abkhazia and Karabakh. 
  In his view, there is no reason for trouble since Moscow's 
decision was prompted by direct requests from the Georgian, 
Armenian, and Armenian legislatures "to disengage the warring 
factions. "We cannot stay aside", he stressed. 
  At the same time, he noted that Russia could control these 
states by slashing credits for them. He recalled that at a bill 
had been passed to limit credits abroad (the bulk of them to CIS 
countries) by 400 million dollars this year. "The figure means 
decimated credits. We do not want to finance war even 
indirectly," he said.

Russian Parliament has declined to include an item about the 
country's federal budget for 1994 on its agenda today. 
  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told the 
chamber that the Lower House, the State Duma which approved the 
budget upon second reading, failed to forward it to the Upper 
House. 
  The Federation Council speaker also informed the members 
that 
the Duma refused to hear the Upper House Budget Committee 
Chairman Nikolay Gonchar who wanted to inform the Duma about 
objections to some articles of the federal budget. 
  According to Shumeyko, the State Duma plans to return to the 
draft budget before forwarding it to the Upper House of the 
Russian legislature. 
  The Federation Council decided to hear Nikolay Gonchar's 
report on Tuesday afternoon and call upon the Duma to take due 
account of the proposals made by Federation Council members. 
  The debate about the proposed budget is nonetheless likely 
to 
take part when the chamber goes down to the "any other business" 
item under pressure of the pickets outside the building who 
demand prompt support for the defence industry.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS-"NG" report under the "Restitution" rubric: </F>
"Deputies Decide What To Do With Treasures"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary hearings were held yesterday at the 
Federation Council on a range of problems connected with the 
legal status and preservation of displaced cultural valuables. 
As has been noted at the committee for the questions of 
science, culture, and education, the resolution of questions of 
restitution is considerably hampered by the absence of a legal 
base for looking at the entire range of problems connected with 
restitution of cultural valuables and the absence of guarantees 
from Germany and the other states on restoring to Russia a huge 
number of works of art and archive files plundered by the 
fascists during World War II. Over those years, Russia lost 
more that 200,000 works of art. 
  The hearings were attended by deputies of both Federal 
Assembly chambers, representatives of the Russian Government, 
the president's staff, ministries and departments, science 
institutions, museums, and archives. Several reports were heard 
from scholars, jurists, and cultural figures, presenting various 
points of view on this question. The main question of these 
debates was, what is the Russian side going to take to the 
scheduled sitting of the Russian- German commission on 
restitution. At the time of going to press heated debates on 
the problem were in progress.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "Aty-Baty" program] </F>
  [Text] We continue our review of the leading military and 
political events, of which the main item is the adoption of the 
state budget for 1994. The budget allocation for national 
defense was one of the fundamental complications in the 
ratification of this annual financial plan. May we remind you 
that at the first reading of the draft budget, the State Duma, 
by a majority of votes, adopted the government proposal and 
ratified the military budget in the amount of 37 trillion rubles 
[R]. The Duma's decision was turned down by the Federation 
Council, which deemed that the expenditure for military needs 
should be R56 trillion, and the draft was returned to the lower 
house for further examination. The State Duma, in considering 
this issue again, came to the conclusion that it could allocate 
no more than an additional R4 trillion for all military 
expenditures. Thus, the maximum figure the military can count 
on in 1994 is R41 trillion. 
  It is important to note that the shortfall in the amount 
requested by the Defense Ministry will most probably be the 
substantial reason for not satisfying social needs of servicemen 
in the current year, primarily in respect to their housing 
needs, daily life, and medical services. The most unexpected 
thing in this whole affair was that Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, 
president of Russia, the person on whose backing the Ministry of 
Defense counted most of all, supported the Duma's initiative in 
limiting the 1994 military budget.

  [Text] Moscow, 20 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Vladimir Lukin, 
chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee for International 
Affairs, thinks that Russia should "more closely coordinate" its 
actions with Washington on the issue of a possible introduction 
of sanctions against the DPRK. 
  This issue was discussed today at a closed session of the 
Duma Committee for International Affairs. The DPRK's ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia participated in the 
meeting. 
  Vladimir Lukin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the 
discussion showed that "the North Korean position is still not 
quite clear." According to him, the DPRK "is either trying to 
`bargain' for better conditions, or gain the time necessary to 
conclude work on the creation of a nuclear weapon."

  [Text] The State Duma council has decided to hold 
hearings, before the parliament recess, on the problem of closed 
cities -- there are more than 100 of them in Russia and their 
population is several million. All the nuclear-and 
defense-related cities face the same problems -- falling 
production, unemployment, environmental pollution. The 
committee for industry, energy, and transport is planning, as 
part of preparations for the hearing, to hold a conference in 
Tomsk-7 at the end of June with representatives of the other 
closed cities and interested departments.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Vladimir Shumeyko, the 
chairman of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament, called 
on Tuesday to extend the mandate of the members of the 
Federation Council which expires in 1995. 
  His proposal is caused "not by the desire of lawmakers to 
retain the positions, but by the interests of the state", 
Shumeyko told reporters and explained that it is necessary to 
preserve the experience accumulated by the members of the upper 
chamber. 
  According to the constitution, the Federation Council is to 
include two representatives from each subject of the Russian 
Federation: one from the legislative and one from the executive 
body of state authority. However, the upper chamber of the 
first convocation was elected for two years in December 1993. 
  Shumeyko's proposal contradicts the constitution, but the 
speaker believes the problem can be resolved through a 
nationwide referendum. "This will be cheaper than new 
elections", he said. 
  Shumeyko added that he had informed the president and the 
speaker of the lower chamber about his decision. They both 
"agreed in principle with that", he said.

  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party's [LDP] faction is 
demanding that the Duma act promptly to prevent the 
privatization program for 1994-1996 from taking effect in 
disregard of the constitution and the Duma. The demand, which 
comes in a statement by the faction leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, was circulated in the parliament's lower house 
today. 
  He says that on June 14 the Privatization Commission of the 
State Property Committee approved the privatization concept and 
program devised under the guidance of the commission's Chairman 
Anatoliy Chubays and drafted a decree on how to implement this 
program. 
  He reports that his faction has prepared an alternative 
concept for the president, government, and Security Council and 
insists on giving it as much publicity as the government's 
package. 
  The LDP faction maintains that the Duma should 
differentially 
distribute incomes from privatization and denationalization and 
proposes that the State Property Committee be abolished and a 
committee to oversee property relations be set up and a state 
committee be formed to control Russia's property abroad. The 
Liberal Democrats also want all privatization profits, including 
those remitted abroad, to be progressively taxed. To cut the 
budget deficit, they consider it necessary to slash aid to 
former Soviet republics.

<F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Scandal in the Duma: </F>
`Decembrists' Slam the Door"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday [15 June] the leaders of the "12 
December Liberal-Democratic Union" deputies' group said that its 
members felt they could no longer participate in the Duma's 
plenary sittings. They marched out of the hall. This action 
was prompted by the cancellation of the decision to register the 
group. 
  The cancellation of the decision to officially register the 
group, made 14 April, was proposed by the State Duma Work 
Organization Committee. The reason being that at the time of 
voting, as it turns out, the group did not have the requisite 35 
deputies' applications. 
  But Boris Fedorov, the group's leader, categorically denied 
the charge. Fedorov claims that the "Decembrists" put in 38 
applications for registration, and copies exist. But all 
efforts by representatives of the group to find out from the 
committee which applications are deemed to have been forged 
failed. 
  The controversial question was submitted for the State Duma 
council's consideration last Tuesday [14 June], but the 
discussion was postponed for a week in order to establish all 
the facts. 
  But Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov sanctioned the 
circulation of the decision to disband the "Decembrists" among 
the deputies without waiting for the facts, Boris Fedorov and 
Irina Khakamada said at a press conference. The group's members 
regard this decision as illegal and are refusing to participate 
in the Duma's work until it is revoked. 
  In his assessment of what had happened, Boris Fedorov said 
that it had been "the usual political provocation." He saw the 
coalition of "Zhirinovskiyites" and "Russia's Choice" people, 
who "have been gnawing away for six weeks now at the question of 
the registration of the `Decembrists' deputies' group", as being 
behind the "provocation." 
  The former have said more than once that they are unhappy 
with the fact that the "Decembrists" now also call themselves 
liberal democrats. 
  "Russia's Choice's" involvement is demonstrated, in 
Fedorov's 
view, by the fact that both Mr. Mityukov and Duma Work 
Organization Committee Chief Vladimir Bauer are deputies of this 
faction. 
  The fact that Fedorov is fighting with Zhirinovskiy over 
more 
than just the right to be involved with the liberal democratic 
camp is nothing new, God knows. Some observers tend to see the 
conflict in the democrats' camp as a consequence of the changes 
that took place at the last "Russia's Choice" party congress. 
  This party, as is known, contains two nuclei -- the 
"Russia's 
Choice" movement and the "Democratic Russia" movement, 
coexisting not without some friction. And whereas last October, 
at the congress of the "Russia's Choice" electoral bloc, 
representatives of the former movement emerged in the top roles 
(and they included such figures as Fedorov, Burbulis, 
Poltoranin, Yushenkov, Murashev, and Golovkov), at the latest 
congress the "Democratic Russia" people (Zaslavskiy, Shneyder, 
and others) prevailed. Now, according to observers, the victors 
will endeavor to keep other representatives of the democratic 
movement from becoming party leader. 
  In this connection it is suggested that the Gaydar-Fedorov 
split could well have its roots in the confrontation between the 
founders of the democratic movement and other representatives of 
democrats.

  [Text] Nursultan Nazarbayev visited East Kazakhstan and 
Semipalatinsk oblasts at the end of last week. He introduced 
the new head of the regional administration Yuriy Lavrinenko at 
a meeting in Ust-Kamenogorsk. Then he left for Semipalatinsk 
where he introduced the new head of the regional administration 
Galymzhan Zhakyanov. During a meeting there Nazarbayev briefed 
his audience on the current economic situation in the Republic. 
He said that we should toughen up control over credit 
allocation to enterprises so as to speed up the process of 
lifting the country's economy out of crisis. The existing 
economic situation should be taken into account in addressing 
any issue. 
  In a message to parliamentarians Nazarbayev dwelled on ways 
of overcoming the crisis. He paid special attention to the need 
for stability in society. This stability can be maintained 
provided all citizens have equal opportunities and a careful 
personnel policy based on regional characteristics is carried 
out. The main thing is not to allow any kind of provocations, 
and to observe the law on bringing charges against those who 
inflame national feelings. The president answered all the 
questions during the meetings.

  [Text] The International Monetary Fund has extended $30 
million to the Kazakh oil and gas amalgamation Mangistaumunaigaz 
to be used for the reconstruction of the oil-production system 
in Uzen (western Kazakhstan). 
  Experts told the Oil Information Agency that the IMF credit 
would be invested in the construction of a facility for 
collecting oil leakage and oil-industry wastes, and for 
processing them into quality gasoline. 
  Kazakhstan's Department for Environmental Protection and 
Biological Resources reports that more than 16,000 square meters 
of fertile soil has been polluted in Uzen. The oil pools are 
polluting the air with hydrogen sulphide, whose content exceeds 
the admissible level.

  [Text] President Akayev pins great hopes on broader 
economic cooperation with Japan and on greater Japanese 
investment in specific projects. 
  Akayev told Japanese Ambassador Kiji Watanabe during the 
ceremony of the presentation of credentials, that since the 
first days of independence, Bishkek and Tokyo had been 
maintaining relations of trust and friendship. "No other 
country helps us more than Japan in promoting economic 
restructuring and the reorganization of the banking and 
communication systems," he said. 
  On the same day, Kyrgyz Prime Minister Apas Zhumagulov met 
with Japanese businessmen to discuss the role of Japan in the 
economic restructuring program. He proposed that Japan invest 
in the Kyrgyz defense, machine-building and agriculture-related 
industries. 
  Zhumagulov said that only about 8 percent of Kyrgyzstan's 
hydro-energy resources were used, and that Japan's participation 
in the construction of small, medium and big hydro-power plants 
might benefit both countries. 
  As an example of bilateral cooperation he referred to the 
plant for the production of semiconductors which is being built 
in the south of Kyrgyzstan. This plant is expected to 
manufacture 1000 tonnes of poly-and mono-crystal silicon a year. 
  Zhumagulov told Interfax that relations between Kyrgyzstan 
and Japan were broadening and that he expected much of the 
Kyrgyz-Japanese committee for economic cooperation, which is to 
meet in Tokyo next November.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Razgulyayev: "Gas, Water, and...Hurt"] </F>
  [Text] Residents of many cities in Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] 
are anxiously turning their gas cookers on and off to see if 
there is still gas. Once again they face the threat of "blue 
fuel" cuts. The threat comes from Uzbekistan, the main supplier, 
for failing to pay for gas already received. 
  Compared with the previous debts, the sum is not too large 
-- 
some $10 million. Politics lends the sum a special weight, 
however. Experts think Uzbekistan's stance has toughened 
considerably in the wake of A. Akayev's visit to Western Europe. 
Its neighbors, especially President I. Karimov, did not much 
like A. Akayev's statements to the effect that Kirghizia is the 
only country in the region that is following the correct 
democratic path and that the som is the most stable currency in 
Central Asia. 
  Whether these guesses are right or not, a fuel blockade 
carries the threat of very serious jolts for the Republic. 
Indeed, they do not only use gas in homes there. It is used by 
many heating systems and by industrial enterprises for 
manufacturing purposes. To all appearances, now they will be 
obliged to look for alternative sources of energy. Even if 
Uzbekistan does not turn off the valve, the price of gas will 
grow all the same, and most of the customers will just not be 
able to afford it. 
  The government has already recommended urgently converting 
social and production facilities to the use of electricity for 
the winter. But this is easier said than done, since it is 
tantamount to a new electrification of the entire republic. 
Material expenditure apart, the deadline is simply unrealistic. 
The plan would take many years, rather than months, of 
sustained and very expensive work. 
  However, a cornered Kirghizia is prepared to make a no less 
weighty move. Uzbekistan's key strategic asset -- cotton -- is 
highly dependent on water from the Naryn. The water has long 
been flowing freely. In its path there stands the Toktogul 
hydroelectric power station that belongs to Kirghizia. Should 
the spillways be closed, the Fergana Valley plantations would 
have a hard time.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] We continue to receive reports of death and injury 
in Tajikistan, as well as attempts by armed guerrillas to force 
their way into the Republic from Afghanistan. Our correspondent 
will tell you in more detail about the situation there: 
  [Reporter Mikhail Nikulin in Tajikistan -- identified by 
caption] It was right here, on the so-called Pyanj sector, that 
a massive offensive by armed detachments of the Tajik opposition 
was supposed to take place on the eve of the inter-Tajik talks 
in Tehran. According to reports from military intelligence, 
such a decision was taken at a meeting of field commanders of 
several formations based in northern Afghanistan. Russian 
border guards, together with the command of the collective 
peacekeeping forces, have taken additional measures to 
strengthen this section of the border. 
  [V. Novikov, chief of staff of Russian border guards in 
Tajikistan -- identified by caption] We can now say that those 
strategic schemes, which the enemy and the opposition were 
hatching, have effectively been thwarted. We can see that the 
situation here is stabilizing. But, on literally every 
centimeter of the border, you can still sense that it is 
explosive, ready to explode at any moment. 
  [Nikulin] But this temporary lull prevails only on this 
section of the 1,200 km border. Elsewhere [pauses] 
  [Novikov, interrupting] Shelling is continuing, attacks are 
continuing, provocations of various kinds are continuing. 
  [Nikulin] During the first 20 days of June alone there have 
already been over 10 armed provocations on the border, as a 
result of which the opposition lost over 15 militants.

<F P=106> [Report by Dododzhoni Atovullo: "Two Wars at the Same Time; </F>
Reportage from Tajik Refugee Camp in Afghanistan"] 
  [Excerpts] Peshawar-Kondoz-Moscow -- From Peshawar it is 
four hours by jeep to the Afghan border and then two days to 
Kabul, from Kabul it takes four days' journey north by donkey 
and horse across the mountain passes to reach Kondoz. It is 
here, in Afghanistan's Northern province, that the largest 
settlements of Tajiks or, as they also called, refugee camps, 
are situated. 
  Over the past two years out of 5 million Tajiks over 300,000 
have died or gone missing and about 1 million have fled and are 
now living in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Turkmenia, Kirghizia, 
Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Over 70,000 former Tajikistan 
citizens are living in four camps around Kondoz. [passage 
omitted] 
  Not only everywhere in the refugee camps -- in the dug-outs, 
tents, and simply on the trees -- but also in almost all the 
stores of Kondoz and Tolikon [name as transliterated] you can 
find posters of Said Abdullokha Nuri. This is the only 
opposition leader to have been with the refugees constantly and 
from the first day. 
  He gives interviews to virtually no one but I managed to 
talk 
with him specially for IZVESTIYA: 
  "We thought our stay in exile would be temporary and very 
brief. But it has all turned out differently. The government's 
calls for national conciliation, the general amnesty, and 
statements about building a democracy state in Tajikistan have 
proved to be nothing but cover for the self-seeking designs and 
political ambitions of those leaders whose intransigence is 
hostile and harmful to the interests of the overwhelming 
majority of the Republic's population." 
  "But what do you hope for?" 
  "For talks. Of course this is a long and complex path, but 
it is the only one that save a people who are tormented, 
tormented, and mortally tired of war." 
  "What will your actions be if the talks nonetheless fail to 
produce results?" 
  "War. Protracted civil war. We know that means new 
sufferings and broken destinies and that it is an impasse, but 
we cannot repeat the mistakes of our predecessors who have twice 
in one century been exiled from their own land. We must return 
to our homeland honorably and with dignity. The key to the 
Tajik conflict is in Moscow. If Moscow wants all knots can be 
untangled. I have frequently said and I repeat once more: We 
are in favor of always having close ties with Russia, we 
recognize its geopolitical interests, and we are in favor of 
Russian troops guarding the border but we want one thing -- 
Russia must not interfere in the internal Tajik conflict by 
supporting one side." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received 
the U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan Richard Kauzlarich at the 
latter's request. 
  President Geydar Aliyev was interested in the results of 
Ambassador Richard Kuazlarich's visit to Washington, and noted 
that at around the same time he had paid an official visit to 
Turkey. 
  Ambassador Richard Kauzlarich said that while he was in the 
United States he held important meetings with a number of 
officials, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Strobe Talbott, and various congressmen. Richard Kauzlarich 
stressed particularly that the Secretary of State was pleased 
with his meeting with the Azerbaijani president. He noted that 
positive changes in relations with Azerbaijan is palpable in the 
United States and the Western countries. The Ambassador also 
noted that the United States is exerting serious efforts to 
increase the CSCE role in the solution of the Karabakh problem, 
and that his country is becoming more active in this direction. 
  The Azerbaijani president said that he was pleased with his 
Istanbul trip, particularly with his meeting with U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher. He said he was certain that the 
meeting would play an important role in the further development 
of Azerbaijan-U.S. relations. He also said they had an 
extensive discussion on Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. 
  President Geydar Aliyev noted that we have not relinquished 
our previous approach, and that we demand the withdrawal of the 
aggressive forces from the occupied lands, the guaranteeing of 
Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, and the inviolability of its 
borders. We assess highly the role international organizations 
play in such important issues, and stressed that the CSCE Minsk 
Group's efforts on the matter will be very important. President 
Geydar Aliyev also touched upon the agreements reached during 
the meetings with the chairman of the [CSCE Minsk] Group Jan 
Eliasson and Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. He 
reiterated Azerbaijan's positions on this issue. 
  [Begin Aliyev recording] During the talks we declared that 
we 
are in favor of settling these issues peacefully and asked him 
[not further identified] to ensure the continuation of the 
cease-fire. We reached certain agreements. Therefore, I want to 
state that our principal stance on these issues remains the same. 
  Your information that there is a positive turn in relations 
between the Azerbaijani Republic and the United States, and 
generally with the West, pleases me. I believe that our loyalty 
to the democratic principles in our republic, the launching of 
democratic and economic reforms, the measures to take our 
country along the democratic path, and our desire and efforts to 
resolve this grave problem -- the ongoing war between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan -- by peaceful means and through international 
organizations, all testify that the Azerbaijani Republic is 
walking, and will continue to walk, on the path of democracy. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Baku, June 20 (TURAN) -- The local population of the 
Kusarskiy region as well as the authorities consider the events, 
which took place in the village of Piral of the Kusarskiy region 
of Azerbaijan on June 14, to be a crime without any ethnic 
colouring, said the Chairman of Azerbaijan's National Equality 
Party, Fakhraddin Aidayev. 
  Aidayev said that on June 14 armed policemen carried out a 
mobilization in Piral village trying to find deserters. As a 
result of confrontation between them and local population, one 
Russian citizen of Lezghin nationality, Nazim Safarov was killed 
and the other one, Fail Mirzabekov, was seriously injured. 
  The State Commission dealing with investigation of the 
reason 
of the conflict has been created. The inquiry has begun. 
"However, one thing is clear now: the policemen exceeded their 
authorities. Nobody must be killed during the mobilization", 
mentioned Aidayev. 
  Aidayev also added that the official media distributes 
unobjective information concerning the Piral incident. 
  Aidayev said that on June 15 there was a rally in the region 
centre of the Kusarskiy region. The rally participants did not 
forward political claims. "They demanded making an assessment 
of the Piral incident", said Fakhraddin Aidayev. 
  "The population of the Kusarskiy region hopes on objective 
results of the investigation by the State Commission", said 
Aidayev. He mentioned that the population demands making the 
heads of law enforcement bodies answerable for their activities 
since Azerbaijan's enemies can take advantage of their 
activities.

  [Text] In the wake of last week's incident in parliament, 
the indignant refugees making their temporary home in the city 
of Zugdidi and Zugdidi Rayon have addressed to Eduard 
Shevardnadze a brief letter supporting the head of state's 
actions aimed at a peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian 
conflict. "Enough bloodshed, enough casualties, our material 
and moral resources have long been exhausted," the letter says. 
"The refugees have reached the point where they have begun 
begging." The documents [as published] are signed by several 
hundred people driven to desperation, they voice their 
indignation at the irresponsibility of opposition-minded 
deputies and their "jingoist speeches" in parliament. "We ask 
you to take all the necessary measures for a timely and 
unimpeded bringing in of peacekeeping forces and their 
deployment in Abkhazia," the authors of the letter insist.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iveri Prangishvili, honorary president of </F>
the Reformers Union of Georgia, by Maka Khetsuriani; date, place 
not given] 
  [Text] Academician Iveri Prangishvili, one of the founders 
of the Reformers Union and its honorary president, answered 
three questions put to him by our correspondent. 
  [Khetsuriani] Batoni Iveri, what does the Reformers 
Union represent and what are its aims? 
  [Prangishvili] First and foremost, the Reformers Union is 
not a political party but an organization whose aim is to 
conduct reforms in a correct manner in the Georgian economy. To 
all intents and purposes, we do not have an economy today; at 
the moment, we can only dream of producing goods. In order to 
restore the economy, it is necessary, first and foremost, to 
restore the old ties with the republics of the former Soviet 
Union that have been ruptured. According to our model, by the 
end of 1994, 50 percent of enterprises will be made bankrupt, 
there will be no more state subsidies, and any enterprise that 
is unable to produce goods will be unable to exist. The 
economic decline will reach its peak at the end of 1995 and then 
come to an end and we will have regulated the situation by about 
2000; so, there exists only one way of reviving the economy and 
this is by concluding treaties with the CIS countries, restoring 
ties with enterprises, renewing relations with factories and 
institutes, exchanging specialists and carrying out joint work; 
we should inform the people in detail of the first successful 
steps and their positive results. 
  [Khetsuriani] Do you think that structural changes are 
necessary in industry and agriculture? 
  [Prangishvili] The Reformers Union understands full well 
that, in order to transfer to a market economy, structural 
changes should gradually be made in industry and agriculture. 
However, we should remember that, in the transitional period, 
we should first invigorate and revive existing economic and 
management structures and subsequently set about modernizing 
them. At the same time, new economic and management structures 
should be formed and there should be a stage-by-stage transfer 
to them according to our state of readiness. It is necessary to 
carry out evolutionary reforms gradually and thereby the revival 
of relations between existing enterprises and management 
structures and their future modernization will be less painful 
for society than neglecting what exists and forming something 
new. 
  [Khetsuriani] What factors could prove effective in 
halting the economic decline? 
  [Prangishvili] First: Inflation will slow down. Its rate 
will fall to 7-10 percent per month. This will continue for 
eight to 10 months and this will already be an indicator of 
stability in the financial system. 
  Second: Price rises will be checked! If, in 1993, prices 
rose by a factor of 20, they will rise by a factor of only four 
or five during this period. 
  The third factor: Unstable enterprises will go bankrupt. The 
number of such enterprises will rise from the current level of 
30 percent to 70 percent. 
  Against this background, I would like to remind you once 
more 
how important it will be to restore economic ties between 
enterprises. Today, our enterprises do not have funds and 
sufficient cadres. They only have premises and old useless 
equipment. The principal branches of industry are not 
functioning; for example, the textile industry is at a complete 
standstill. It is impossible to change this situation and 
revive production and the economy without restoring the 
aforementioned ties. 
  Naturally, the establishment of ties with other countries as 
well will render great service to the revival of our economy; 
for example, a treaty will be concluded with the United States 
in accordance with which we should be allocated credits to 
construct 200 small hydroelectric power stations. We hope that 
we will also be given help in constructing a 600 megawatt 
thermal power station in Kutaisi. All of this lies in the 
future. It is precisely the realization of these prospects that 
forms the aim of the Reformers Union. If we achieve the 
development of our country's economy, we, both the founders and 
members of the union, will feel that we have fulfilled our duty 
to Georgia.

<F P=106> [From 21 Jun EESTI SENUMID, HOMMIKULEHT, RAHVA HAAL, </F>
POSTIMEES, pp 1, 3; "News Bulletin" No. 119/94] 
  [Text] The Chinese leaders fully understand Estonia's 
foreign political priorities and intend to support them, 
President Lennart Meri and Foreign Minister Juri Luik announced 
at yesterday's news conference. 
  The president and the foreign minister met President of the 
People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng 
and Deputy Prime Minister-Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. 
President Meri said that their discussions concerned a number 
of issues, including relations with Russia. The Chinese leaders 
expressed full support to the demand of troops withdrawal by 
August 31 and also pointed out that China will not agree to 
Russia's claim for peacekeeping mandate in the territory of the 
former USSR, he said. The president added that the Chinese 
foreign minister had agreed to his views on the need to increase 
the role of the small countries in the UN. Meri also stressed 
that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will visit Estonia as soon as 
on July 2. "It would be comical to consider it a mere 
coincidence," Meri commented. 
  Juri Luik added that both parties agreed to exchange 
information between their UN representations. Luik stressed the 
increasing role of China at the UN Security Council. He 
explained that Estonia will follow the practice of most Western 
European countries in developing relations with China and 
Taiwan. Luik also told the news conference that China will 
refrain from supporting possible propagandistic accusations of 
human rights violations in Estonia and will refer to Estonia as 
a country that has restored its independence. When asked about 
discussing human rights situation in China, Luik said that a 
"wide political debate took place". 
  President Meri further pointed out that Estonian-Chinese 
economic cooperation has been quite modest. The 3 million 
dollar loan for purchasing Chinese goods can only be used after 
the presidential visit, since only one enterprise had been 
previously authorised to mediate the trade, Chairman of the 
Consumers Cooperatives Central Union Raivo Kutt said. 
  Luik stressed that China is interested in Estonian cellulose 
and paper production, cooperation in oil shale mining and 
processing and in purchasing Estonian office furniture. 
Estonia's interest in Chinese pharmacy was also mentioned. 
  Estonia can also rely on Kazakhstan's support on all major 
issues, Meri told the news conference. He met President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev and other Kazakh leaders on June 10-12 and 
also the foreign minister on return from China. President 
Nazarbayev explained him the principles for his proposed 
Euro-Asian union. The Kazakh leaders are interested in 
developing economic relations with Estonia and opening 
diplomatic representations, Meri said. An agreement on mutual 
understanding and cooperation was signed during the visit.

  [Text] Today, as every Monday, pickets stood outside the 
Russian naval headquarters building in Tallinn. Member of the 
Swedish Riksdag, Peter Luksep, speaking from the picket line, 
said that the presence of Russian troops in Estonia is not an 
issue for Estonia and Russia alone. The presence of Russian 
troops in Estonia concerns democracy in Europe as a whole. 
  Reet Tobre, chairwoman of the Petserimaa Association, said 
in 
her speech that during the last few weeks Russian border guards 
have detained several Estonians who were visiting their 
relatives in the Russian side. They were accused of violating 
the regulations on the Estonian-Russian line of control. 
  Tunne Kelame said that the Estonian National Independence 
Party faction in the Riigikogu has presented the Riigikogu with 
a draft law on restoring Petserimaa district to Estonia.. 
  Every Monday pickets stand outside the Russian naval 
headquarters building demanding an unconditional withdrawal of 
the Russian Army from Estonia by 31 August. The pickets are 
organized by the Estonian National Independence Party.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 20, BNS -- Latest Labor Market 
Department reports show the number of unemployed in Estonia at 
18,621, which corresponds to a jobless rate of 2.21 percent. 
  A decline in the number by 901 from May 1 is attributed to 
seasonal effects, said Inge Rauba, departmental head at the 
department. 
  Regionally, unemployment rates continue to be highest in the 
northeastern Ida-Virumaa region and the city of Kohtla-Jarve, in 
the southern Polvamaa and Vorumaa counties, as well as in the 
western island county of Hiiumaa, where the rate was more than 5 
percent over the national average, Rauba said. 
  The reference for the Labor Market Department Calculations 
is 
the number of working-age population in the country as of Jan. 
1, estimated at 840,790. 
  Estonia as of May 1 had officially registered 19,522 as 
unemployed, which amounted a jobless rate of 2.32 percent.

  [Text] The Foreign Affairs and Security Committee of the 
Latvian Cabinet of Ministers today approved an interim agreement 
between the Latvian and Russian Governments on travel from 
Latvia to Russia, and return to places of permanent residence in 
Latvia of citizens of the former USSR who are neither citizens 
of Latvia nor citizens of Russia nor citizens of a third 
country. According to the interim agreement, the 
above-mentioned people will be able to travel to Russia without 
visas and return to Latvia showing documents stating their 
identity. The passport of the former USSR, which has an entry 
in it about a person's place of permanent residence in Latvia, 
will ensure visa-free return to Latvia. 
  Apart from this, the Committee also approved an agreement 
between Latvia and Russia on the work of border representatives, 
which envisages nomination of plenipotentiary representatives of 
the two states for settling incidents that have occurred on the 
border and for tackling problems related to the border. The 
agreement provides that each side nominates one plenipotentiary 
border representative and two deputies, who will consider 
problems arising on the border at conferences after a proposal 
from either side.

  [Text] Italian Ambassador Umberto Pestalozzi [name and 
title as received], Swedish Ambassador Andreas Aadahl [name and 
title as received], and Gerald (Hamilton), the CSCE commissioner 
in Latvia, met President Guntis Ulmanis today. This time all 
three supported the CSCE's opinion regarding the Latvian 
citizenship bill. They stressed that they supported the 
interests of the Latvian state and saw that much has already 
been achieved after independence was regained. However, parts 
of the bill, which do not meet CSCE requirements, are now 
causing a certain anxiety. 
  The Swedish ambassador acknowledged that it was impossible 
to 
achieve in three years what other European countries have 
achieved in the whole post-war period, and that the issue of the 
presence of ethnic minorities in Latvia was also the issue of 
survival for the Latvian people. 
  The Italian ambassador stressed that not everyone presently 
fully understands the particular significance of the citizenship 
law and the consequences that may follow if the bill is passed 
in its present version. That will also complicate Latvia's 
joining the European Council. 
  The CSCE commissioner, for his part, noted that the part of 
the draft law, which lays down naturalization quotas, was 
considered the most critical point. He said experts from the 
Council of Europe were currently in Riga and they will help the 
Saeima work out a suitable version that international 
organizations, including the Council of Europe and the CSCE, 
will be able to support.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 20, BNS -- The newly established Latvia's 
National Conservative Party LNNK elected Saturday former 
National Independence Movement Board Chairman Aristids Lambergs 
as its leader. Lambergs candidacy was supported by 231 
delegates of the party congress while his rival Andrejs 
Krastins polled only 67 votes. Baiba Petersone became the 
party's deputy chairwoman. 
  The amended party program calls to strengthen the national 
statehood of Latvia by implementing tough and clearly defined 
immigration policy, supporting repatriation programs and basing 
the citizenship law on the quota principle. In addition, the 
program provides to establish the Constitutional Court to 
supervise the law abidance of state administration, local 
governments and top officials. 
  The section of the program dedicated to national security 
and 
defense intends to improve information processing system within 
the framework of the security service. It plans to continuously 
analyze the situation in Russia, set up a special structure to 
combat organized crime and define a professional army as the 
basis of the Defense Forces. 
  The economic program focuses on balanced monetary policy, 
more efficient privatization process, encouragement of export, 
completion of land reform and creation of favorable environment 
for foreign investment. 
  Latvia should give up retransmission of Russian television 
programs because these broadcasts "ensure the psychological 
comfort of aliens unloyal to the (Latvian) state," according to 
the program. 
  As reported, the Latvian National Independence Movement 
changed its status during its congress on Saturday to become the 
National Conservative Party LNNK.

  [Text] Vilnius June 20 TASS -- "An intention expressed by 
the head of the U.S. Administration to meet leaders of the three 
Baltic states in Riga on July 6 shows that the United States has 
recognised and respects our independence," said Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas in a traditional interview on 
national radio on Monday. 
  "I have received a very kind message to this effect from 
Bill 
Clinton in which he confirms the fact of his arrival in Riga and 
his wish to meet the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia," Brazauskas said. 
  The Lithuanian president expects to discuss with Bill 
Clinton 
regional problems and hopes for Clinton's support which "has 
been felt until now." 
  Brazauskas added that "we would attempt once again to 
acquaint the U.S. president with the conditions for foreign 
investments into the Lithuanian economy, which, in our opinion, 
are not bad and which we are going to improve, taking into 
account the experience of Central European states."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 20, BNS -- The leader of the 
Lithuanian parliament's rightist opposition, Vytautas 
Landsbergis, is quite reserved in his estimations of Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius' proposal to set up an 
international commission of experts to assess the possible 
economic consequences of savings restoration. 
  At a press conference Monday, Landsbergis said there is 
doubt 
whether such a commission would be "objective and impartial." 
  The opposition leader, who also heads the Conservative 
Party, 
told reporters that the conservatives became cautious after a 
meeting in early July with Peter Cornelius, representative of 
the IMF in Lithuania. The IMF official expressed his negative 
attitude toward the Conservative Party's initiative to hold a 
referendum on unlawful privatization and savings restoration, 
and warned that consequences of an indexation would be ruinous 
to the Lithuanian financial system. 
  The conservatives, who suggest a hundredfold indexation of 
people's savings, said Cornelius expressed "strange views" about 
their initiative and Lithuania's economic policy in general. In 
a letter sent to the IMF leadership, the Conservative Party 
asked to explain whether Cornelius expressed his personal 
attitude or the official position of the fund. 
  In Landsbergis' words, the IMF representative expressed his 
opinion before he heard both sides. "We were under the 
impression that Cornelius is not an independent expert, or 
dependent on the Lithuanian Government," the opposition leader 
said. In his view, the government uses representatives of 
international organization "for internal struggle." 
  The Lithuanian parliament is scheduled to discuss the 
premier's initiative Tuesday. Parliament Chairman Ceslovas 
Jursenas said the proposal is "attractive" because "people must 
understand what is suggested for the referendum." 
  Landsbergis said he hopes that an international commission, 
if it is set up, will be able to analyze the general situation 
in Lithuania more carefully, and the opposition will have an 
opportunity "to explain some things about the government's 
policy."

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 20, BNS -- An estimated 21,551 crimes 
were reported to law enforcement agencies during the first five 
months of this year in Lithuania, or 19.5 percent less than 
during the same period last year, the Lithuanian Statistics 
Department said. 
  According to the report, the number of crimes during the 
same 
period decreased by 11 percent in Estonia and 30 percent in 
Latvia. 
  58 crimes are committed per 10,000 population in Lithuania, 
94 in Estonia and 64 in Latvia. The number of serious crimes 
increased by 9.5 percent in Lithuania compared to the same 
period last year. 193 murder cases have been reported so far, 
or 78 more than last year. 
  But the number of disclosed crimes also increased running at 
42 percent in April and 43 percent in May. Around 24 percent of 
crimes are disclosed in Latvia and Estonia, the Statistics 
Department said. 
  The number of crimes involving firearms went up from 101 
cases during the first five months last year to 131 cases this 
year. 
  The number of racketeering cases tripled since last year 
despite police efforts to combat organized crime.

post-Soviet states in the territory of the former USSR because 
at the time when the accords were signed these countries were 
not subjects of international law. This statement was made in 
an interview with INTERFAX by the President of the Belarussian 
[Belarusian] Academy of Geopolitics Professor Valentin Akulov. 
  In addition, in his opinion, the West violated the Helsinki 
principles when it recognized new republics formed in 
ex-Yugoslavia. Thus, a key argument of opponents to changes in 
borders does not stand up to criticism cannot be seen as an 
obstacle to a Confederation of the Peoples of Belarus, Russia, 
and Ukraine. 
  In the opinion of the professor, the idea put forward in 
Moscow a few days ago by public groups from Russia, Belarus, and 
Ukraine can be put into practice already this year through 
referendums in the three countries. Supporters of a 
confederation speak for joint armed forces and a common ruble 
space but separate parliaments. 
  The leader of the Russian Consolidation Party (one of the 
advocates of a confederation) Aleksandr Tikhonov is expected to 
raise the matter during his Tuesday meeting with the speaker of 
the Russian State Duma Ivan Rybkin.

<F P=106> [Article by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw </F>
Bahdankevich: "The State Is Endangered!"] 
  [Text] In assessing the results of our economic and social 
development, Belarusian statesmen are pushing forward the idea 
that, despite the exacerbating crisis, the key sectors of our 
economy were not destroyed, there has been no massive drop in 
production, and prices have not continued to increase. They 
erroneously believe that it was regular and centralized 
deliveries of energy resources that allowed our economy to 
remain afloat. 
  It should be noted that, indeed, production and consumer 
demand for energy resources were completely met in 1993-94. 
However, no one ever asked the question -- at what cost and 
with what consequences? -- or saw fit to provide an answer. 
  Let us clarify this issue. 
  The centralized supply of these resources to the Republic is 
being carried out through natural exchanges in the form of 
clearing operations and bartering. However, such economic 
relations have irrecoverably damaged the national economy and 
triggered a wide range of negative consequences. In particular, 
according to experts' estimates, in comparison with our losses 
in 1993 -- due to underestimated prices for Belarusian-made 
products delivered on a clearing basis ($349 million) and 
overestimated prices for Russian-produced goods ($88 million) -- 
our 1994 will total some $437 million. 
  Belarusian economic entities -- dealing with clearing-basis 
deliveries -- continue to suffer losses. For example, prices 
for tractors delivered on a clearing basis stand at 82 percent 
of market prices in Belarus and Russia, while prices for cars -- 
85 percent. Due to this, in 1993 the Minsk Vehicle Factory 
suffered losses amounting to 69 billion Belarusian rubles [R], 
while in January-April of 1994 -- R18 billion. To fulfill 
planed deliveries of refrigerators on a clearing basis in 1994, 
the Minsk Refrigerator Factory will suffer losses amounting to 
R135 billion. 
  Due to the unprofitability of deliveries of 
Belarusian-produced goods by our enterprises, the Republic 
chronically fails to meet its commitments. Already in 1994, 
clearing-based imports from Russia have exceeded our exports by 
37 percent, which automatically triggers equivalent 
nondeliveries from Russia. 
  Economically unjustified prices are imposed on products 
delivered on the basis of clearing transactions and 
intergovernmental agreements. In particular, oil prices on the 
Belarusian market in January slightly exceeded 70 percent of 
clearing-based prices, in May -- 62 percent (foreign prices for 
oil in 1994 stood at $85 per tonne, while the domestic price in 
January was $61, and in May -- $53); prices and tariffs on 
electricity and central heating in Belarus are roughly four 
times lower than prices for electricity and gas imported for 
these purposes. If we can put it this way, our economic policy 
lacks sense. We are buying products from Russia at high prices 
and selling them on our domestic market at low prices. The 
question arises: At what expense and who is being made to 
compensate for these expenditures? At the expense of eating 
away at our foreign loans. 
  In accordance with the aforementioned trends, as a result of 
price distortions, participants in clearing-based deliveries are 
suffering huge losses. For example, this year, the Ministry of 
Resources -- handling clearing-based oil deliveries to Belarus 
-- suffered losses to the tune of R838 billion, while the 
Ministry of Energy -- after selling electricity and heating to 
Belarusian consumers -- suffered losses amounting to some R4 
trillion. 
  The Belarusian Government probably has resources, which 
could 
allow it to compensate for these losses. However, the answer 
is not clear: The government has no such assets. Between 
January and April of this year, the government used some R1.2 
trillion -- or 15.4 percent of all budget expenditures, that is, 
the entire volume of yearly budget expenditures designated for 
these purposes -- to underwrite state subsidies. 
  Moreover, according to Finance Ministry estimates, in 
connection with the shortsighted pricing policy regarding the 
import of energy resources and the preservation of the old 
system of regulating prices for agricultural products, bread, 
milk, tariffs for municipal services, city transportation, and 
so on, some R5-6 trillion will have to be issued for these 
purposes (according to May 1994 figures, we have every reason to 
believe that this sum will be much higher). 
  Despite the fact that Belarusian consumers receive energy 
resources at prices which are lower than their import prices, 
and due to the weakening of payment discipline and solvency 
among the enterprises, their debts for using energy resources -- 
received on a clearing basis and through intergovernmental 
agreements -- are growing. 
  As of late May 1994, the oil debts of Belarusian enterprises 
to the Ministry of Resources amounted to R760 billion or 69 
billion Russian rubles; gas debts to the Belarusian State 
Company for Gas Transportation and Delivery -- R5.9 trillion or 
534.1 billion Russian rubles; debts for electricity and central 
heating to the Ministry of Energy -- some R1.4 trillion or 125 
billion Russian rubles. Mutual debts of all Belarusian 
enterprises for oil, gas, and energy resources total more than 
R8 trillion or 729 billion Russian rubles. 
  Distortion of domestic and foreign prices, increases in 
debts 
for energy resources, lack of budget means necessary to cover 
losses of importers of energy resources prompt increases in 
Belarusian debts to other states, primarily to Russia. Oil 
debts of the Belarusian Ministry of Resources in late May 
reached R760 billion or 69 billion Russian rubles, gas debts -- 
R5.8 trillion or 533 billion Russian rubles, and electricity 
debts -- $869 billion or 79 billion Russian rubles. 
  The system regulating economic relations exerts constant 
pressure on the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble and 
triggers its decrease. Taking into account the impact of a 
stable exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble on the 
stabilization of the national economy and continued speculations 
of some of our statesmen on this issue, I will present the bases 
of this subject. 
  The economic essence of the ratio of one currency to another 
is nothing more than the price of money. It, in turn, as the 
price of any commodity, depends on the market correlation 
between supply and demand. 
  It has been tested in practice and confirmed by economic 
relations that if demand exceeds supply, prices rise. If it is 
the other way around, prices fall. 
  Considering the price of money -- the currency exchange rate 
-- the correlation between these indexes is defined by trade and 
payment balances. If they are negative, then the price of a 
given state's currency is lower than the price a partner-state's 
currency. When these negative balances increase, prices -- the 
currency rate of a state with this negative tendency in trade 
and payment balances -- continue to fall. 
  What about these tendencies in the Belarusian economy? 
  According to the State Committee for Statistics, Belarusian 
imports in 1993, in particular, from Russia, exceeded exports by 
R1.149 trillion, while in the first quarter of this year the 
negative trade balance reached a level of R713 billion. 
  Due to this negative balance and the aforementioned 
regulation of intergovernmental agreements, current Belarusian 
debts to Russia, as of late May, stood at R7.4 trillion or 681 
billion Russian rubles. In connection with the increase in the 
negative balance in trade and current debt, demand for Russian 
rubles has increased, while in connection with the decrease in 
exports -- the supply of Russian rubles has decreased. This, 
overall, triggered the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. 
  The increase in the supply of Belarusian rubles -- due to 
increased credit allotments by the Belarusian National Bank 
forced under constant pressure from the government -- 
considerably decreased the exchange rate of the Belarusian 
ruble. Our estimates indicate that the rate of the Belarusian 
ruble against the Russian ruble fell in inverse proportion to 
the increase in earmarked credits. 
  The increase in the proportion of the Belarusian-Russian 
trade balance -- based on barter and clearing deals -- has also 
had some impact on the falling Belarusian ruble exchange rate. 
If in 1993 barter deals composed 17 percent of all Belarusian 
exports, in the first quarter of 1994, that figure reached 30 
percent. Barter operations narrow the sphere of the 
money-exchange relationship and thus increase the disparity 
between supply and demand for a currency. 
  The increase in the negative trade and payment balance, 
growth in the unfounded issue of credits, and the naturalization 
of foreign trade prompted the drop in the Belarusian ruble 
exchange rate against the Russian ruble from 1.33 (as of 24 
March 1993) to 4.51 (as of January 1994), later to 9.97 (as of 1 
April 1994) and 11.00 (as of 1 June 1994). 
  Therefore, state regulation did not only exacerbate the 
problems, but also triggered an economic collapse and deep 
crisis in the financial situation of enterprises and the state. 
The image of social welfare, however, did develop. 
  Proceeding from the officially confirmed 35-percent drop in 
industrial production in the first quarter of 1994 and taking 
into account the impossibility of selling at least half of all 
goods produced, the real drop in production stood at 75 percent. 
By using energy resources and other material elements of 
production, and selling products at fixed prices, enterprises 
are operating in a mishmashed environment, which aggravates 
their financial situation. The bulk of our enterprises lost 
their directions and prospects -- formed under market relations 
-- for development. 
  Our agricultural sector is also experiencing difficulties. 
Increases in state support for this sector of the economy, in 
the form of state subsidies and favorable credits, does not at 
all compensate for all losses incurred from violations of price 
parity for agricultural and industrial goods. 
  The financial situation in the transportation network -- in 
particular, in city transport -- and municipal services due to 
tariffs, which are lower than production expenditures, is 
continuing to exacerbate. In particular, 90 percent of costs 
for housing and municipal services should be subsidized by the 
state and only 10 percent -- be covered by tariffs. Limited 
subsidies from the budget do not provide for the financial 
stabilization of the enterprises in this sector. 
  Eventually, state regulation of the economy, which does not 
agree with basic economic laws, has exacerbated the already 
distorted financial situation in Belarus, primarily, its budget, 
and has prompted a huge budget deficit. 
  To cover this deficit in the first quarter of this year, the 
Belarusian National Bank has used its yearly quota of credit 
issues. Along with this, foreign debts have climbed to such a 
level that the Republic is in danger of going bankrupt. 
  The Belarusian people will have to pay a considerable price 
for overcoming this situation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Presidential Candidate Zyanon </F>
Paznyak's Economic Program"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. What "Heritage" Will Z. Paznyak Inherit From the V. </H5>
Kebich Government? 
  The Kebich government received all necessary powers from the 
Supreme Soviet to implement market reforms and stabilize and 
strengthen the economy of the Republic. However, four years 
have passed. 
  Within this period: 
  -- The volume of production has decreased by more than 50 
percent; 
  -- Inflation exceeded 50 percent per month; 
  -- Foreign debts now total some $1.5 billion and are growing 
at a rate of $1 billion a year; 
  -- Prices for basic consumer goods jumped by 3,000 percent; 
  -- Seven in every ten Belarusian citizens live below the 
poverty level. 
  Time -- the most valuable factor -- has been lost. The years 
1991 and 1992 were the most favorable for reforming the national 
economy. This time could have been used to carry out profound 
reconstruction of the national economy with much lower 
expenditures, for introducing new jobs, for producing 
competitive products, and for ensuring public welfare. 
  The government has not only failed to begin reforming the 
economy in this direction, but has no idea of how to do this. 
<H5>  II. Reasons for the Economic Crisis </H5>
  -- Deliberate unwillingness on the part of the government to 
pursue an independent economic policy, the lack of political 
will -- to formulate a track for the state's development -- 
among the majority of Supreme Soviet deputies. 
  -- Violation of basic economic concepts of ownership. The 
economy preserved its nonmarket nature, however, despite this, 
[the government] tried to implant market mechanisms and levers. 
This triggered the mismanagement of, and anarchy in, the 
production sector, the violation of proportions between work and 
consumption, which, in turn, prompted profiteering drives, a 
drop in production, and inflation. 
  -- Continuous destruction of the monetary and credit system. 
  -- Foreign trade is directed against domestic producers, 
especially against our agricultural workers. 
  -- The preservation of the dominant state ownership in both 
the industrial and agricultural sectors. 
  -- Lack of goals and programs postulating the transition of 
the national economy to alternate principles, to the opposite 
type of production -- production based on a market economy. 
<H5>  III. Why Does Belarus Require the Market? </H5>
  According to the experience of advanced states, the economy 
has no other mechanisms -- other than the market -- to promptly 
report on who requires our products and to objectively report on 
the efficiency of national enterprises. 
<H5>  IV. Key Principles of Reforms </H5>
  -- In line with the Constitution. In line with Clause No. 1 
of the Constitution, "... The Republic of Belarus has all powers 
on its territory to pursue an independent domestic and foreign 
policy. 
  "The Republic of Belarus protects its independence and 
territorial integrity, constitutional order, and provides for 
lawfulness and legal order." 
  The implementation of reforms in the Belarusian economy will 
entirely correspond to the constitutional principles and vital 
interests of our people. 
  -- With this purpose in mind, all factors shaping Belarusian 
statehood -- borders, customs checkpoints, a national currency, 
banking system with the central bank, the ability to protect our 
state sovereignty (the national Armed Forces) -- should be 
preserved. 
  -- Nonviolation of the principles of the inviolability of 
ownership and preservation of ownership rights. Each person 
must be sure that their hard-earned property will never be 
expropriated. 
  -- In the state-owned sector, functions of maintaining state 
property and exercising power will be separated. (Functions of 
exercising power will be transferred to stock holding companies 
and concerns, while functions of maintaining state property -- 
to the Ministry for Management of State Property; terrestrial 
property is defined according to the law on land.) 
  -- Market relations -- given the equality of all forms of 
ownership -- will be put on a legal footing to provide for: 
  a) The freedom of economic activity for physical and 
economic entities; 
  b) Freedom of people's consumption on the market; 
  c) Setting conditions for the development of competition. 
  -- The establishment of a private (nonstate) sector in the 
economy through destatization and privatization, the formulation 
of state policy encouraging entrepreneurship. 
  -- The adoption of military expenditures standing at no more 
than 6 percent of Gross National Product. 
  -- State policy aimed at the profound reconstructing of the 
Belarusian economy and providing selective support to specific 
enterprises and sectors of the economy which have real chances 
to enter the global market with competitive products. 
  -- The implementation of monetary reform and the legal 
strengthening of the national currency of the Republic of 
Belarus as sole legal tender. 
  -- The establishment of a taxation system aimed at 
supporting 
production, the pursuing of an active investment policy; an 
increase in amortization allotments. 
  -- An active and designated social policy aimed at 
supporting 
the unprotected segments of society at the expense of the state 
and local budgets. 
  -- A guaranteed redemption of state debts to the citizens 
at the expense of privatizing state property, as well as at the 
expense of real estate. 
  -- The implementation of a new budget policy based on: 
  a) The formation of the budget from below, at the local 
government level, 
  b) Procurement of profits using state property, 
  c) The refusal to issue subsidies to producers, however, 
support for financially insecure citizens is obligatory, 
  d) Reducing expenditures for maintaining the state 
administration, 
  e) Earmarking considerable funds to ensure the legal order, 
protecting the life and health of citizens, guaranteeing 
ownership rights, and protecting the property of physical and 
economic entities, 
  f) Financing such sectors as culture, scientific 
development, education, and health care, 
  g) Financing Chernobyl cleanup programs and establishing a 
system for ensuring environmental safety. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Economic Policy </H5>
  The domestic economic policy will set conditions ensuring 
the 
stabilization of the economy and providing for the welfare of 
citizens. To realize this goal, the Belarusian economy must be 
put on the market track. Special attention will be focused on 
the nonstate sector of the economy, toward support for small- 
and mid-sized businesses. 
  A quick transition to market purchasing and selling of all 
products and resources will be implemented. This is a key 
condition for the implementation of reforms ensuring the 
economic order and giving producers genuine knowledge about the 
needs of society for specific products, resources, and labor. 
All the remaining issues -- social security, privatization, 
procurement of foodstuffs, conversion, etc. -- cannot be 
resolved without the absolute independence of businesses on the 
condition that they receive maximum profits. 
  Market trade is based on trade contracts and money is the 
means of serving them. Therefore, we will adopt such a monetary 
and credit policy that will shrink the monthly inflation rate to 
2-3 percent. To implement this, monetary reform -- along with 
establishing the customs territory, accumulating currency 
reserves, establishing an appropriate financial infrastructure, 
resolving technical issues such as printing money and drafting a 
normative basis [not further identified] -- will be carried out. 
During the first stage, accounting checks from the National 
Bank will receive the status of national currency. 
  The key means to provide for "sound" money will be the 
transition of all businesses, irrespective of the forms of 
ownership, to a system of market relations. In addition, the 
law on bankruptcy -- with all the necessary leverage for its 
implementation -- will be adopted. 
  Other urgent measures include: 
  -- The legal shaping of the state debt, procedures for its 
molding, and sources for the redemption of this debt. 
  -- Recognition of compensations -- for bank deposits of 
citizens and residential housing construction cooperatives, and 
for a part of the pensioners' fund -- as related to the category 
of state debt. 
  -- Implementation of a new policy regarding wages and 
incomes 
of state sector workers and employees of budget-sector 
institutions postulating that people with equal qualifications 
and job performance are equitably compensated. 
  -- Antimonopoly policy and state control over conditions 
providing for competition among producers. 
  -- A housing policy aimed at building houses at the expense 
of the partial utilization of state funds to set up an 
engineering infrastructure in construction areas and citizens' 
savings to build houses. To provide for this, financial 
mortgage institutions will be established. 
  A state energy program aimed at renewing and developing the 
national energy-generating capacities will be drafted and 
implemented. A tariff policy that encourages energy-saving 
steps and state standards defining obligatory conditions for the 
conservation of resources will be adopted. 
  -- The implementation of an efficient demographic policy 
supporting women, children, and young families. 
  -- An efficient migration policy in the interests of the 
state. 
  Belarus has considerable raw material and mineral resources. 
Therefore, a state program regarding the development of ferrous, 
nonferrous, and rare-earth metals, and additional prospecting 
for energy resources will be drafted. The proposed technologies 
should also include stringent environmental controls. A range 
of agreements -- on issuing concessions for extracting raw 
materials and energy resources on the territory of other states 
-- will be signed. 
<H5>  VI. Land Reform </H5>
  Land is a key strategic resource of any state. It is on the 
land where a person lives and produces, on the basis of which 
agricultural production functions. 
  The Republic of Belarus -- a big state in the middle of 
Europe with a moderate climate -- is rich in land resources. 
  Attitudes toward land and land management should be 
economically sound, scientifically founded, and efficient. 
  Currently, land policy is acquiring a particular weight when 
our society has to move to a new stage -- toward a market 
economy when the role of the state is considerably decreased, 
when incompetent politicians can carry out the total 
privatization of land which is scientifically and methodically 
unfounded. (By the way, in 1992, the opposition Belarusian 
Popular Front faction in the Supreme Soviet managed to vote down 
such concept of privatization, in other words, "collective 
ownership.") State policy should be rational, scientifically 
based, and stringent. The government should establish a 
committee for, and -- during the implementation of reforms -- a 
ministry for land resources. 
  We favor privatizing land ownership, equal rights for all 
citizens in land privatization, however, we oppose land as a 
source of profiteering or a basis for the exclusive power of the 
corrupt nomenklatura (officials). 
  We require new laws on land. Land should become a commodity, 
but of a specific nature. 
  The key condition for the efficient utilization of land and 
its socially-fair privatization is the establishment of precise 
land valuation, otherwise, not privatization but land-grabbing 
will happen. To introduce land evaluation, a special state body 
should be established which -- by not violating the rights of 
local bodies -- will keep privatization in line with state 
interests. 
  Local authorities should have their own funds to implement 
social programs. The land tax -- a key source in forming a 
budget in the agricultural areas -- will raise this money. 
Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and other users of land should not 
supplant local bodies, but engage in economic activities and pay 
-- like all other land users -- a land tax that is economically 
founded and equal for all. 
  It is strictly prohibited to purchase land rights by 
purchasing real estate. Currently, it is possible to 
automatically privatize a plot of land in a city when 
privatizing a shabby house. We will abolish such a practice. 
  Favoring the unification of the monetary systems of Russia 
and Belarus, some politicians do not realize the consequences of 
this move. Unification with a state, which has already 
established its market structure and mortgage banks, and which 
has experience in privatizing [state property] -- including land 
-- leads to a situation whereby a Belarusian agricultural worker 
or an entrepreneur (our powers did not allow them to become land 
owners) could be left without land in their native state. 
  Privatization of land is not an aim in itself, but a way to 
raise the efficiency of the economy, a way of guaranteeing the 
establishment of a network of small enterprises processing 
agricultural products. This means that agricultural products 
will be preserved, and our export potential will be increased. 
This is our key guarantee for any investments and, hence, the 
primary condition for spurring investment and the economy in 
general. 
  The land market -- functioning through mortgage banks and 
land mortgages, a nonemission credit policy -- is the real way 
out of the crisis, a path along which all developed states had 
gone. Belarus is extremely rich in land resources. We should 
now be wise in using them. 
<H5>  VII. Agrarian Policy </H5>
  The key goal of our agrarian policy is the welfare of an 
agricultural worker and the efficiency of his work. 
  Land should reacquire masters, and our society -- 
agricultural workers. As a result, an entrepreneur could engage 
in private enterprise, and could choose what and where to 
produce without any state involvement. All forms of organized 
production -- state, collective, and individual -- will have 
equal rights. Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and farmers could set 
prices for their products themselves. Only the market will 
regulate them. 
  Each producer will become an owner of his own products, and 
will be able to sell them -- for a profit -- without any state 
restrictions. The evil practice of signing obligatory contracts 
based on low prices will be abolished. 
  Purchasing land on preferential terms for private ownership 
with the right to divide and sell it (except for agricultural 
production) is economic nonsense. Preferential terms could be 
postulated only when land plots are apportioned to financially 
insecure sectors of the population for temporary (or indefinite) 
use within a legal framework. As for the land for agricultural 
purposes, we favor free privatization of land by those citizens 
and associations who want to work on this land, however, it 
would be based on the Republican legislation, on condition that 
free privatization will account for not more than 30 percent of 
the total land in this category. Further increases in 
agricultural land holding will take place at the expense of land 
leasing from the state (with the right to subsequent purchase) 
on equal terms for all economic entities irrespective of the 
forms of ownership. 
  Our state is slow in competing for agricultural commodities 
markets. If, in the near future, we do not develop agricultural 
production that is efficient and competitive, we could even lose 
our domestic market due to high production costs. 
  Our businesses will have the opportunity to become market 
structures, voluntary associations of owners in the form of 
partnerships, stock partnerships, unions, associations, etc. 
Equal conditions for the development of various forms of 
production organizations -- both collective and individual -- 
will be created. 
  State programs for financing technological reconstruction, 
the proportional development of all sectors of agricultural 
production will be drafted. A network of agricultural mortgage 
banks -- to credit agricultural production, to build houses and 
sites of social designation based on property mortgage -- will 
be established in the shortest time possible. 
  Special attention will be devoted to the processing of the 
agricultural production. Primarily, all state-owned meat 
processing factories, dairy plants, sugar refineries, 
fruit-and-vegetable processing plants, and related businesses 
will be privatized. All businesses will receive their share of 
stock. Favorable credits -- for purchasing installations and 
building small processing enterprises -- will be earmarked. 
  To more efficiently use and promptly supply all producers 
with agricultural vehicles, all agricultural equipment will be 
privatized. Based on currently existing workshops in the 
agricultural sector, servicing organizations (stations) will 
service state, collective, and agricultural businesses and 
private plots. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>
  Our foreign economic policy is aimed at establishing 
partnerships primarily with neighboring states. Belarus is 
striving to sign agreements on free trade, customs and currency 
unions, on ensuring mutual freedom for activity of economic 
entities, on most-favored-nation status, on ensuring guarantees 
for the right of ownership, the protection of personal property 
and property of economic entities on their territories, and in 
the long run -- setting up a common market. 
  Monopoly in foreign trade will be abolished. The number of 
suppliers and consumers -- particularly, in energy resources -- 
will increase. 
  A new customs policy -- encouraging exports -- and a new 
license policy -- regulating imports -- will be formulated. 
  A single free economic and off-shore zone on the territory 
of 
the Republic of Belarus -- making it attractive to foreign trade 
-- will create new jobs and increase the national income. 
  Across the territory of Belarus, a free banking zone -- 
based 
on Swiss banking laws -- will be established. This will make 
Belarus attractive to foreign banks and investment companies. 
  A system of international exchanges -- stock, energy 
resources, metals, grain -- will be established.

<F P=106> ["The program of Vyachaslaw Kebich, candidate for the </F>
presidency of the Republic of Belarus"] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots! 
  As a candidate for the presidency of the Republic of 
Belarus, 
I am ready to take upon myself the responsibility of expressing 
and defending the interests of the people of my Republic by 
constitutional means. 
  I am convinced that the primary goals of our people and our 
state are peace and accord, security, material prosperity, 
revival of national culture, strengthening of democracy and 
lawfulness, and observance of human rights and freedoms. 
  Belarus should create a society of high economic 
effectiveness and social justice, which guarantees the right to 
employment, free-of-charge secondary [bazovoye] education and 
medical service, as well as pension and social protection. The 
state is called to create conditions allowing every man to 
secure his family's living by means of his own work. 
  These are hard times for all of us. Securing our statehood 
and economy is a difficult task. 
  Notwithstanding all measures taken by me, the disruption of 
traditional economic ties, as well as political and economic 
instability in our partner countries have not been conducive to 
stabilizing our economic situation. We are shouldering a heavy 
burden of costs connected with the aftermath of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. The Republic has been left practically alone in 
the face of this misfortune. National income and the standard 
of living have decreased. 
  Belarus, as other countries of the CIS and East Europe, was 
not able to join the world economy for objective reasons. A new 
social and economic system for the organization of society has 
not been formed. A legislation basis for deep transformation 
and a mechanism for implementing resolutions has not been 
created. Such is the truth about our life. This is our fault 
and our misery. 
  However, notwithstanding these extremely difficult 
circumstances, our population has been provided, through 
superior efforts, with all the basics: electricity, heat, gas, 
foodstuffs. 
  Our industry, agriculture, culture, science, and education 
have not been allowed to break down. The manageability of our 
economy and the social achievements of the people have been 
preserved. National accord in our society has been preserved. 
We live in peace and friendship with other nations. 
  We have eliminated many barriers in relations between 
Belarus 
and Russia, as well as taken the first steps toward our economic 
unification. We defeated fascism together, we will overcome the 
crisis together, we should head toward the future together! 
  I heartily thank you, all the people, for your great wisdom 
and endurance, selfless labor, and faith in our Belarus during 
this hard period in our history. This gives strength to my 
assurance that we will overcome all difficulties and obstacles 
on the way toward a worthy and prosperous life. 
  I appeal to the people of Belarus, the soviets at all 
levels, 
trade unions, all parties and movements to unite our efforts to 
overcome the crisis and to lead our Republic toward normal 
development. I do not belong to any party, and I will defend 
the interests of all citizens regardless of their political 
views and their ideological or religious beliefs. The interests 
of the people come first for me. 
  I believe that the president should serve his people 
honestly 
and be a guarantor of the Constitution, as well as civil rights 
and freedoms. I will create every possible condition for the 
revival and development of the national culture and the 
Belarusian language. I will guarantee the right to profess any 
religion. 
  The people of Belarus should live in dignity, without fear 
for the future, and be proud of themselves and their Motherland! 
  I will resolutely and uncompromisingly fight corruption and 
crime. I will safeguard personal immunity and protection from 
interference in the individual's personal life. 
  Our way is that of a civilized humane nation, the way 
without 
ruining the existing social achievements, the way of rational 
transformations without impoverishing the people. 
  I definitely oppose the ruining of our national intellectual 
potential -- the Republic's most valuable possession; I oppose 
the decreasing of the social significance of intellectual work 
and the immigration of intelligentsia. 
  I will not allow any manifestation of militant nationalism 
and chauvinism, as well as any political confrontation with 
neighboring countries or others. I believe that inciting ethnic 
feuds is a grave crime. There are, and will always be, 
"second-class" citizens in Belarus. I reject violence as a 
means of resolving political and interethnic problems. 
  I am against economic isolationism, against unreasoned 
sociological and economic experiments, against pseudo-reforms. 
  I will be consequently seeking rapprochement, as well as the 
strengthening and development of cooperation with Russia, 
Ukraine, and other democratic states of the world community. 
  The future of our nation lies in the health and prosperity 
of 
our children today. I guarantee the president's special 
attention to the protection of maternity and childhood. I will 
seek additional preferential measures for working women and 
mothers. I will propose a national program, "The Future of 
Belarus," which will not only protect, but also develop 
national health. 
<H5>  The Republic of Belarus Should Have a New Social and </H5>
Economic System 
  The basis for a new social and economic system should be the 
Constitution, the principles of national security, economic 
effectiveness, and social justice, and the need for harmonizing 
interests of all segments of society. 
<H5>  Economic Transformations Should Serve Each and All the People </H5>
  It is necessary to establish the priority of economic over 
political interest and to create a system of civilized 
management of the economy without administrative restrictions. 
  I see the creation of a new social and economic system in 
Belarus as connected with structural transformations in all 
spheres, above all, with the distribution of ownership and the 
optimization of money and credit system, financial relations, 
tax policies, the implementation of a new structure of the 
national economy and foreign economic relations, the improvement 
of state management, and the social protection of the population. 
  Privatization controlled by the state will be oriented 
toward 
overcoming the crisis, restructuring and stabilizing the 
economy, as well as increasing the economic effectiveness and 
the people's welfare. I am behind privatization. 
  These goals will be achieved by: 
  -- Clear definition of ownership; 
  -- Simplification of procedures for privatization in the 
interest of the workers; 
  -- Redistribution of state property between Republican and 
local levels on behalf of the latter; 
  -- Clear definition of state enterprises' status as well as 
the conditions for owning, using, and managing state property; 
  -- Creation of an infrastructure of market economy; 
  -- Creation of Republic's mortgage funds as guarantees to 
big domestic and foreign investors. 
  State Regulation of the Economy. It is necessary to leave 
basic and socially important branches under state control: the 
fuel and energy sector, finance, transportation, communication, 
science and education, social protection, ecology, and natural 
resources. 
  The president and the government will ensure: 
  -- Control over state enterprises and sectors not subject to 
privatization; 
  -- Reorganization and redirection of state enterprises based 
upon the concept of new economy; 
  -- Management of state investments and subsidies; 
  -- Management of employment and job placement for young 
people in order to prevent mass unemployment. 
  The clear and just criteria for distributing financial and 
other means between central and local authority bodies will be 
established on a legislative basis. 
<H5>  Monetary and Credit System; Financial, Currency, and Tax </H5>
Policies. 
  In the new social and economic system and socially oriented 
market economy, the banking system will play a significant role. 
  Banking legislation will be improved and a new system of 
management of the National Bank will be implemented to further 
the development of the Republic's economy. The state will 
ensure support for basic and socially important branches. 
  I will implement a network of anti-inflation measures, 
including: 
  -- Restoration of ruined financial and economic relations; 
  -- Utmost use of effective production capabilities; 
  -- Indexation of pensions and bank savings, the curbing of 
the increase of prices; 
  -- Introduction of a new mechanism for issuing credits to 
enterprises and people; 
  -- Encouragement of state activities in investments; 
  -- Control over the formation of prices and tariffs for 
certain types of foodstuffs and services; 
  -- Developing free business and trade zones. 
  I will make every effort to implement a progressive system 
of 
taxation and to develop the stock and bond market. 
  All conditions to attract foreign investors will be created. 
<H5>  Restructuring Industry </H5>
  The primary task is to halt the crisis and stabilize 
production. The strategic goal for Belarus is to join the world 
economic system. 
  All conditions for encouraging production of domestic and 
foreign investors will be created. Scientific and production 
potential of military industry will be oriented toward science 
intensive technologies, technological reequipment of the 
economy, needs of social sphere, and the production of consumer 
goods. 
  I head the work for restructuring our economy, therefore I 
will not allow bankruptcy of enterprises producing goods 
necessary for people; I will assist and support such enterprises. 
  To form market and develop private business, I will 
guarantee 
the freedom in choosing directions and spheres of activity, 
including foreign trade, as well as the equal chances for all 
economic entities and support for small- and medium-sized 
business in the interests of all society. 
  I will pay special attention to legal protection and 
economic 
support of industry, agriculture and private business, as well 
as to protection of our manufacturers from unreasonable imports. 
  I will decrease taxes on imports of modern technologies, 
equipment for industry and agriculture, and especially necessary 
consumer goods. 
  In the period of transition to a market economy, I will 
establish a state antimonopoly control and prevent any 
interference in business undertaking activity. 
<H5>  Land Should Be Taken by Landlords To Revive the Countryside </H5>
  I guarantee state support for agriculture. 
  I believe that a man working on land should be able to sell 
his produce without difficulties and live prosperously by his 
work. Guided by this principle, I support a transition to modern 
multistructured agriculture which comprises various 
complementary forms of ownership -- state, cooperative, and 
private. 
  I uphold kolkhozes and sovkhozes; I will support their 
voluntary transformation into joint-stock companies. I uphold 
the formation of a reliable structure for agricultural 
production. I uphold the development of strong personal truck 
farms free from taxes. 
  I will support agricultural and agro-industrial enterprises 
financially; I will introduce only two taxes in agriculture -- 
the differential tax and the property tax. 
  I will disallow profiteering in land and administration 
interference in farming. Farming will be operated solely 
according to economic levers and the principle of a just parity 
of prices. 
  Qualified agricultural workers are our national pride. They 
are called on to safeguard the Republic's needs in foodstuffs. 
Carrying out rational transformations in the countryside is 
their responsibility. 
  I believe it necessary to introduce state subsidies for 
prospective branches of agricultural production -- 
highest-quality seed farming, livestock breeding, flax growing, 
implementing modern and ecologically clean technologies. 
  I will safeguard the social revival of the countryside. 
<H5>  The Government is for the People, Not the People for the </H5>
Government 
  This slogan by our national hero Kastus Kalinowski [leader 
of 
the anti-czarist uprising in the 19th century] is, in my 
opinion, a basic principle underlying the formation of a new 
system of state management. 
  I believe it to be my holy duty to safeguard the 
unconditional fulfillment of the Constitution and the laws of 
the Republic of Belarus. 
  I will seek to ensure the precedence of law over the current 
authority, observance of personal rights and freedoms, and 
equality of all citizens before the law regardless of their 
official positions. I will safeguard strong control over the 
implementation of adopted laws and resolutions at all levels. 
  I will resolutely and rationally lead an uncompromising 
fight 
against crime and corruption. 
  Guided by the Constitution, I will propose a new Cabinet of 
Ministers consisting of competent, highly-educated, and 
trustworthy people who are loyal to the principles of democracy 
and national sovereignty. I am ready to invite experts from 
various parties and movements to participate in the government. 
<H5>  Security of Citizens and the State, Resolution of Ecological </H5>
Problems Means Order in Our Common Home 
  The president will be a guarantor of security for citizens 
and the state. I will create a reliable system of national 
security. The Republic will take part in the CIS collective 
security system. A buildup of the Belarusian Armed Forces and 
the maintenance of their combat readiness will be accomplished 
in the interests of the people and according to the Belarusian 
Constitution and the state military doctrine. 
  I will firmly defend the personal security of every citizen, 
every family, and all economic entities by all legal means. 
Safeguarding security and justice, strengthening of law and 
order, and protection of human rights are the most important 
tasks of the presidency as well as priorities for the nation. 
  The accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is the 
most 
serious catastrophe in the history of mankind. Along with the 
entire nation, I am extremely concerned about the ecological 
situation in our Republic. 
  I will initiate the adoption of a law on protection of the 
nation's ecology. I will seek to focus all means and resources, 
allocated by our Republic and the world community to deal with 
the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, to restore a healthy 
environment and to abandon harmful technologies. 
  I will ensure that every person will have the right to due 
process and material compensation for injuries due to toxic 
accidents. 
  We are doomed to live on land contaminated by Chernobyl. I, 
as the president, will do everything under these difficult 
circumstances no only to preserve the nation but also create 
conditions for its development. 
<H5>  Social Policy Will Be Pursued in Everybody's Interest </H5>
  The formation of a new social and economic system is 
impossible without a strong social policy by the president. 
  My new social policy provides for the following: 
  -- Preservation of social achievements of the people; the 
indexation of pensions and savings in 1994-95; 
  -- Creation of conditions for every able-bodied citizens to 
enjoy their right to work with a guarantee for protection of 
other rights and freedoms; 
  -- Legislative regulation of high incomes through the system 
of progressive taxation with the purpose of eliminating economic 
stratification and economic inequality; 
  -- Legislative guarantees for a minimum income with 
definition of a clear mechanism for changing this minimum; 
  -- Increase of living space funded by the state and means 
from other sources; a guarantee of housing for socially 
unprotected citizens of Belarus. 
  I favor improving the social protection system. I will pay 
special attention to the introduction of social benefits for 
sick people, invalids, single mothers and large families, 
orphans, mothers of perished sons, and veterans. 
  A system of multipurpose credits for young people and young 
families will be implemented to promote and upgrade vocational 
training, facilitate obtaining housing, and expedite acquiring 
personal property. 
  An important task of the state will be to support families 
and women -- mothers and educators of our children. As early as 
1994, I will introduce special state deposits to obtain housing 
for every newly-born Belarusian citizen. 
  Special attention will be given to health care to heighten 
its effectivity and quality. I guarantee available and free 
medical care for all segments and groups of society. The 
development of paid forms of health care will be pursued without 
replacing free health care. New forms of financing will be 
provided, as well as improved medicines and new equipment, 
produced due to conversion; incomes of medical workers will be 
increased. 
  The state will become a guarantor of fair compensation for 
servicemen and workers of law enforcement bodies, considering 
their difficult service of protecting the people and the state. 
Before having been transferred to the reserve, every serviceman 
will have an opportunity to retrain to a civil profession. I 
guarantee preferences for servicemen in pension and housing 
security. 
  I will pay special attention to youth employment. Graduates 
of higher educational institutions and technical high schools 
will be provided jobs. Stipends for students will be 
established at a level no lower than the minimum wage. 
  I will submit a proposal for granting amnesty to certain 
categories of citizens. 
  I will support the development of physical training and 
sports as well as the Olympic movement. We are proud of our 
celebrated sportsmen and Olympic athletes. 
  I consider the partnership between the government and 
employers, trade unions, and other social organizations as 
important. 
<H5>  Culture, Education, and Science Are Our Priorities </H5>
  Man should have the highest value in our society. The 
Republic of Belarus should join the global system of education, 
science, and culture. 
  Regarding education, I propose: 
  -- To create a system of modern preschool and school 
education, directed toward the formation of a highly moral 
person and toward inculcation of spiritual values, patriotism, 
respect toward parents and the older generation; I will ensure 
a significant increase in teachers' incomes; 
  -- To develop an open state vocational and technical 
education ensuring modern professions to people. 
  Young people will have the possibility to be educated on a 
competitive basis at the state's expense in domestic educational 
institutions and leading foreign educational centers. Every 
needy student will be granted a place in the student dormitory 
on preferential terms. 
  The harmonious development of the Belarusian nation cannot 
be 
separated from the Russian culture and language. I support the 
idea of establishing an open Slav university. I will uphold the 
development of schools with instruction in the national 
languages of Belarusian minorities on the basis of unified state 
programs. 
  I will strive to restructure science, as well as concentrate 
the efforts of academic and branch scientific research 
institutes in resolving priority problems. I will ensure 
first-priority subsidies for fundamental research based on state 
orders. 
  I guarantee fair compensation to scientific workers, 
stipends 
for scientific degrees, and intellectual property protection for 
scientists and inventors. 
  The situation in culture is an indicator of the moral health 
of the people! 
  Using all the president's prerogatives, I will support the 
revival of all ethnic cultures, the Belarusian language, 
traditions, and moral values; I will ensure the protection of 
monuments of culture and architecture, art and history. 
  I will assist in the creation of Belarusian cultural centers 
in foreign countries; I will develop relations with Belarusian 
immigrants. 
  I will oppose allowing low-quality culture into Belarus, as 
well as the disruption of scientific, cultural, and 
informational spheres. 
  I will ensure state financial support for culture, science, 
and education. 
<H5>  Belarus Is Open to Mutually Beneficial Cooperation </H5>
  Our foreign policy will be based on the principles and norms 
of international law, on the rejection of the use of force or 
the threat to use force. 
  The strengthening of our statehood and sovereignty as well 
as 
the use of our geopolitical location is a necessary basis [as 
published] for joining the system of new international relations 
by Belarus. 
  I will pay special attention to the strengthening of a 
mutually beneficial political and economic union with Russia and 
Ukraine -- a reliable core of the CIS -- and to the development 
of friendly and equal relations with all states. 
  Essential steps will be taken by Belarus toward integration 
with the European and the global system of political, economic, 
and trade relations. 
  The proposed program will be implemented in two basic 
stages. 
  The first stage, 1994-95, will focus on stabilizing the 
economy, overcoming crises, and implementing a strong social 
policy in the interests of the people. The second stage, 
1996-97, will focus on an intensive structural transformation of 
the economy and state system, an equal global partnership, and a 
significant increase in the peoples' prosperity. 
  Dear compatriots! 
  Everyone of us faces an important decision on the day of the 
presidential elections. Your future and the future of your 
children depends on who you will elect the president. 
  I have served my nation honestly and conscientiously during 
all my life. In the course of preparing these programs and 
meeting with people, I had to reconsider and reevaluate many 
issues. How to lead Belarus out of the crisis? How to make 
people's lives secure and happy? The solutions to these 
problems are proposed to a considerable extent in my program. 
  I think that I will express the opinion of the majority of 
my 
fellow citizens by stating that we need a strong executive 
power, discipline, and responsibility to overcome today's 
crisis. I fully realize that all the responsibility for 
implementing this program should be shouldered by the president. 
  My experience as well as the powers vested in the presidency 
by the Constitution strengthen my certitude that this program 
will be fulfilled. 
  I declare my intent to seek your confidence through 
constitutional means during the election of the president of the 
Republic of Belarus. 
  On 23 June, you will make your choice prompted by your 
wisdom, mind, and heart.

  [Text] The head of a Ukrainian military delegation, Defense 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, has held several meetings in 
Washington's White House. Intensive talks at different levels 
have been held during the Ukrainian delegation's official visit 
to the United States, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Press 
Service reports. In Chicago, Vitaliy Radetskyy and his 
colleagues were warmly greeted by the local Ukrainian community. 
In his address to its members, Radetskyy dwelled in detail on 
the course of Ukraine's army building. He stressed that the 
present state of military and technical capability in the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces is quite sufficient for the defense of 
the Ukrainian state. At the same time, Radetskyy pointed out 
the problems of servicemen's social protection. The most urgent 
of these, he said, is the housing problem, in the solving of 
which Ukraine could use, as far as possible, the assistance of 
the Ukrainian community in the United States.

  [Text] Donetsk 20 June TASS -- "Unless the price of 
Ukrainian goods is lower than that of Russian goods, customs 
checkpoints must continue to function," Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with the workers of the Azovmash 
machine-building plant in Mariupol, Ukrainian port city on the 
Azov Sea, on Monday, Kravchuk said that "we cannot allow the 
scanty Ukrainian market to become empty. If we open up the 
borders now, the major part of consumer goods and agricultural 
produce will be taken out to the Russian Federation." 
  "Presently, due to objective reasons we have a situation 
when 
the same goods made in Russia and Ukraine have different 
production costs," Kravchuk continued. He believes that 
production cost largely depends on the price of energy carriers, 
the bulk of which Ukraine receives from Russia. 
  "If Ukrainian enterprises paid for oil and gas as much as 
Russian plants and fabrics pay, then we would need no customs 
checkpoints. Trade between Ukraine and Russia would become state 
business, not private," he said. 
  Kravchuk stressed that "trade relations between Ukraine and 
Russia must develop and expand." "Such great powers must have 
strong friendly and economic ties," he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Yermakov, chairman of the "Union- </F>
Prosperity in Unity" association, by V. Glinskiy; place and date 
not given: "Union-Prosperity in Unity"] 
  [Text] The "Union-Prosperity in Unity" 
[Soyuz-Protsvetaniye v Yedinstviye] association has recently 
been registered in Sevastopol. It brings together political 
activists, deputies, economic leaders, workers, businessmen, 
servicemen, culture workers, and artists. What goals does the 
union pursue? Ivan Fedosovich Yermakov, chairman of the 
association, answers this and other questions. 
  [Glinskiy] Ivan Fedosovich, there are dozens of parties, 
civil organizations, and movements in the city, and now another 
one has appeared. What goals does the union pursue and why was 
it established? 
  [Yermakov] Currently, when the overwhelming majority of our 
city's residents live below the poverty level, all who have 
ended up in poverty are looking for salvation, for a way out of 
the abyss. In the first place, the people were appealing to the 
Ukrainian president, Supreme Council, and Cabinet of Ministers 
with requests and demands to halt the pilferage of our country, 
to not break ties with neighboring countries, and to actively 
implement reforms, in this way preventing a further decline in 
production and inflation. The people's voice was not heard by 
the people in power. 
  Currently, it seems that the state is unable to protect its 
citizens, in terms of social and legal protection. The old 
bureaucratic elite is neither able to conduct reforms nor handle 
state processes. For a long time, there has been a situation 
when the upper class cannot, and the lower class does not want 
to live in the old way. We have been talking about democratic 
society for almost 10 years. What do we have? The great 
Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who has recently returned 
to his motherland, termed this period pseudo-democracy. He was 
right. 
  The people are still carrying the heavy burden of violence, 
bureaucracy, and corruption, and they actually do not have any 
control over the authorities. This lack of control has untied 
the hands of the ruling elite, which has sold out its people. 
Currently, to maintain its power, it is inspiring interethnic 
hostilities and destroying the centuries-long unity of the 
Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and other people. 
  [Glinskiy] As I understand, a new stage of the battle for 
real democracy, based on popular rule, has recently begun. This 
has been reflected in your association's platform. 
  [Yermakov] Our association considers the unification of 
Slavic states -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus -- as well as 
nations inhabiting them, to be a priority. Polls indicate that 
about 80 percent of these countries' people want to live in 
friendship. They are united not only by Christianity and a 
common alphabet, sanctified by the names of Cyril and Methodius 
[inventors of the Cyrillic alphabet], but also by family ties. 
They are united by the huge economic and geopolitical 
territory, which was conquered by their ancestors in a hard 
struggle, and which must be preserved for their children and 
grandchildren. The Slavic people's prosperity and security lie 
in their unification... 
  [Glinskiy] Ivan Fedosovich, while reading your platform, I 
paid special attention to the excerpts concerning economic ties 
between countries and regions, the establishment of regime 
supporting revival of economy and new and old economic ties, the 
liquidation of quotas, licenses, exhausting taxes, etc. 
  [Yermakov] Our union has a precise program. It provides 
answers to such urgent questions as halting the decline in 
economic and agricultural production, integrating Sevastopol's 
economy with the Crimea, and improving Crimeans' living 
standards and ecological situation. The stabilization and way 
out of the crisis is based on the recognition of all forms of 
property, development of medium- sized and small business, 
entrepreneurship, competitive production, and access to markets. 
Ideas of the "Union-Prosperity in Unity" are close to those of 
other public organization. For example, a conference of 
Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian democratic forces has 
recently been held in Kharkov. In the interests of the Slavic 
people's rapprochement, the governments were requested to adopt 
legislative acts on the establishment of unified economic zone. 
As everybody knows, 12 bordering oblasts of Russia and Ukraine 
have set up transparent borders. Cultural and sport ties are 
also developing. The city of Sevastopol, for instance, 
strengthens its ties with Moscow, Krasnodarskiy Kray, St. 
Petersburg, Minsk, and Kiev. 
  [Glinskiy] The actions of your union and other democratic 
forces call forth discontent among the bureaucratic elite and 
nationalists of all breeds, who are currently playing the last 
card, to preserve themselves in power. This card serves to 
scare people. They openly talk about a new Karabakh, 
Yugoslavia... 
  [Yermakov] Conflicts are imposed on the people against their 
will. The countless army of bureaucrats, feeling neither the 
government's bridle nor responsibility before the people, flexes 
its muscles at all levels. Let us look at the current conflict 
between the Crimea and Ukraine. As everybody understands, the 
Crimean people have the right to defend their political, 
economic, and personal interests through the adoption of their 
own Constitution. This is being done in accordance with 
international norms and agreements recognized by the entire 
civilized world. 
  I personally recognize Ukraine's western oblasts' right to 
self- determination, and I am ready to support them. This is 
their right, and it should be unconditionally respected. 
  [Glinskiy] Is your criticism of the Ukrainian president and 
highest authorities not a result of personal resentment against 
Kravchuk, who removed you from the office of presidential 
representative and Sevastopol City Administration chairman? 
  [Yermakov] I would like to remind the readers that before 
that, I was chairman of the City Council and Executive 
Committee. Moreover, I was a deputy chairman of the Crimean 
Supreme Council. In my work, I did not abandon my conscience, 
and I was trying to protect the interests of Sevastopol 
residents. Therefore, I have a clear conscience. The only 
thing that bothers me is that I could have done more for the 
city, had I not been removed.... 
  [Glinskiy] Is this why you are again running in the upcoming 
elections for City Council chairman? 
  [Yermakov] I have been thinking a lot about whether I should 
again be involved in political battles and join the electoral 
marathon. I have already seen all that. But, during these 
three years in power, I understood many things: the ruling 
cadres, their professional qualities, the capabilities of 
state-owned and commercial enterprises, or alignment of 
political parties and movements. I know what must be done, and 
how, to implement reforms, and to make the city begin to earn 
its life. 
  I now have a clear, considered program to lead the Crimean 
Republic and Sevastopol out of the crisis. There are the 
executors of this program as well. While supporting the majority 
of ideas advocated by the "Rossiya" bloc, I stand on the 
centrist positions. Only together will we be able to extricate 
ourselves from the current crisis. 
  I have already formed a team comprising talented people who 
are able to think and work for the good of Sevastopol residents. 
  My goal, as either the "Union-Prosperity in Unity" 
association chairman or the City Executive Committee chairman, 
is a peaceful life of Sevastopol residents within a brotherly 
union of Slavic states: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus.

<F P=106> [Report by Mykhaylo Soroka: "Approach to Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk spent only six 
hours in Luxembourg on 14 June. There is no doubt, however, 
that this visit will become a hallmark in the history of the 
young Ukrainian state. Having signed the agreement on Ukraine's 
partnership and cooperation with the European Union [EU], Leonid 
Kravchuk, speaking figuratively, opened for our state the door 
to Europe. The meaning of this step will be fully assessed in 
the future. Meanwhile, we want to emphasize that Ukraine was 
the first of the former USSR republics to make this step. 
  Both in Ukraine and near abroad, certain people view the 
"Luxembourg breakthrough" as definite orientation by Ukraine 
toward the West. However, is this actually so? Speaking at a 
news conference at Seningen Palace, which served as the 
Ukrainian president's official residence, Leonid Kravchuk 
underlined that we have equal interest in good-neighborly 
relations and mutually advantageous relations with all nations 
-- East, West, North, or South. Shortly after those statements, 
speaking at Boryspil airport, the president placed special 
emphasis on the development and consolidation of Ukrainian 
relations with Russia. Thus, our state is by no means going to 
curb these. On the contrary: It is in Ukraine's vital interest 
(probably just as in our eastern neighbor's interest) that our 
relations consolidate and are of a stable and mutually 
advantageous nature. 
  However, would it do any harm to our state if it finds new 
promising directions for cooperation, including in a westerly 
direction? I think that the answer to this question is evident. 
Yet, once we asked it, let us cite the opinions of renowned 
experts to find out how Ukraine is going to benefit from 
cooperation with the EU and what possibilities are opened by the 
Luxembourg agreement. 
  This is how the URYADOVYY KURYER question was answered. 
  European Commission Chairman Jacques Delors: "This is a very 
important agreement for Ukraine. It will help Ukraine 
consolidate its sovereignty and carry out a gradual, and what is 
more, soft transition to an efficient economy in the interests 
of its people. 
  "I would like to especially single out this point for your 
readers: Ukraine is the first of the former USSR states to sign 
an agreement with the EU. Before the signing, we held detailed 
discussions with the Ukrainian president about the acute 
problems facing your state, and how to expeditiously make the 
agreement work to help Ukraine resolve these problems. I want 
to add that both I and other European Commission members will 
everything in our power to achieve this goal." 
  Borys Oliynyk, chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
Commission for Foreign Affairs and CIS Relations: "I believe 
that Tuesday 14 June is indeed a significant day, and not only 
for Ukraine, but for all of Europe as well, because we are 
returning to Europe. Or rather, not returning but turning our 
face toward it, because we often turned our back on it. This is 
not an ordinary everyday event. It is opening new prospects for 
us. I am not going to sink in euphoria. Today, the Ukrainian 
president pointed out that we have secured a base. This is 
correct, but we now have to `grow roots' in this base. The 
return to Europe does not mean that we are turning away from our 
other neighbors. No matter where our partners are 
geographically located, we have to turn our face to them. This 
would be honest policy." 
  Oleh Slepichev, Ukrainian minister of external economic 
relations: "The very name of the agreement explains its meaning 
-- it deals with both cooperation and partnership. Take trade 
and economic relations for instance. Ukraine needs markets, 
including European markets. However until now, the European 
market was for all intents and purposes closed to us. First, it 
is being protected with quotas, and second, with the so-called 
antidumping legislation. The agreement gives us the chance to 
overcome this barrier and enter the European market. This will 
help shore up our production and improve the quality of exported 
goods. On the other hand, the signing of the agreement amounts 
to Ukraine's breakthrough to GATT. Support from GATT members is 
very important to us, and the EU is among the most influential 
members of this organization. Besides, it is vital for Ukraine 
that it is recognized as a state undergoing a transition from 
centrally managed economy to a market. This would give us the 
chance to enjoy GATT privileges for a certain period of time, 
regarding the selling of our products on foreign markets. In 
other words, the Luxembourg agreement is our great political 
victory." 
  Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko: "The 
agreement lays the political-legislative groundwork for 
Ukraine's relations with EU states, which would be equal to, 
civilized, and advantageous for us. Work on drafting this 
document was very strenuous and lasted for almost a year. There 
was a series of talks and expert conferences in both Kiev and 
Brussels. The negotiation process was significantly accelerated 
after the issue of eliminating Ukrainian nuclear weapons was 
resolved. What is the essence of the 14 June agreement? This 
is quite a voluminous document comprising 100 articles and a 
number of provisos. The introduction to this document 
emphasizes that EU states recognize Ukraine's independence and 
support its sovereignty and territorial integrity. A 
significant portion of the agreement deals with the issues of 
Ukraine's trade and economic relations with the EU, including, 
in particular, the issue of a transitional period in trade 
between them. This period is to last until 31 December 1998, 
after which Ukraine's admission to the free trade zone could be 
discussed. 
  Thus, the agreement opens broad prospects for Ukraine's 
existence on the European continent. The decisive word is to be 
had by the Ukrainian legislature, which has to ratify the 
agreement." 
  This is what our and foreign senior officials think about 
the 
agreement. As we see it, despite all the nuances, the general 
conclusion made by them is: Integration with the EU is not only 
advantageous for Ukraine -- it is imperative. Even more so 
since sooner or later all European states will approach and join 
the EU. Europe does not have any other option. Russia is closer 
than anybody else to following Ukraine's example. This may 
happen in near future. 
  Yet, our state was the first to make this step. How can one 
explain why it was Ukraine that was given this chance? I have 
asked Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to answer this 
question. 
  President Kravchuk: "Two factors must have had their effect 
on this matter. The first is the political, international 
factor. This is a confirmation of the role Ukraine is currently 
playing. I think and hope that European and world nations have 
seen the persistence of our domestic and foreign policies even 
in such extremely complicated situations as the resolution of 
the problem of nuclear arms, relations with our neighbors, the 
Crimean issue, or the division of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Everybody sees that Ukraine is acting in accordance with the 
law, the Constitution, abiding by the principles proclaimed by 
the United Nations, its Security Council, and the CSCE. This 
cannot pass unnoticed. Thus, by signing the agreement, not only 
respect toward Ukraine was demonstrated, but also our state's 
actual role in the European process marked. 
  There is also the other, so to say, technical side -- our 
departments, including the Foreign Ministry, worked more 
efficiently [than foreign ones] to achieve this goal." 
  Europe, in which world wars have flared twice in this 
century, for the last 50 years has been building relations on 
norms that are civilized, peaceful, and generally acceptable for 
all the states. The EU, which comprises the Western states of 
our continent, has become an influential force in this process. 
The mission of the young Ukrainian state, which is establishing 
its position in the world and, primarily, in the European 
homeland, is to find the shortest way of rapprochement with the 
EU. From this perspective, Leonid Kravchuk's 14 June visit to 
Luxembourg and the documents signed there should be viewed as an 
event of European scale and historic significance.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko: "An Important </F>
Step Toward Europe"] 
  [Text] Having signed an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation in Luxembourg on 14 June, the Ukrainian president 
opened a new page in relations between Ukraine and the 12-member 
European Union [EU]. 
  The path traveled by the EU and Ukraine to meet each 
other during the year-long negotiating process was not easy. 
There were both points of mutual understanding and seemingly 
insurmountable -- at first glance -- obstacles; however, victory 
was achieved by the joint desire of both sides to establish 
legal foundations for Ukraine's joining European processes. 
  In one fell swoop, Ukraine has ceased to be a subject of 
international relations in spite of its own will. With regard 
to the official membership of the former Ukrainian SSR to the 
United Nations and other organizations with their headquarters 
in Europe, this did not make Ukraine a full-fledged participant 
in the European community of nations. This is why the joining 
of European economic and political structures is a logical and 
necessary direction in Ukraine's foreign policy at the current 
stage. 
  Ukraine ranks fifth in Europe in terms of population and 
first in terms of area. It is not a reason for pride or some 
pretensions, but this fact cannot be disregarded, either. 
Europe, too, has many key positions in Ukraine: transit 
highways, reserves of raw materials, and ten of millions of 
qualified producers and perspective consumers; or, quite the 
opposite -- a potential hotbed of instability if the ark of 
Ukrainian statehood goes to pieces. Therefore, many things 
depend on how Western states approach our country. 
  The EU, in this context, plays a leading part. The 
development of multifarious cooperation between Ukraine and the 
EU is a path toward the gradual integration of the Ukrainian 
economy into the European economic zone and the establishment of 
broad economic ties with leading European countries, without 
loosing traditional ties within the CIS framework. 
  In 1993-94, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, with the 
participation of a number of branch ministries and departments, 
held four rounds of official talks with the European Commission 
on the concluding of a framework agreement on partnership and 
cooperation. The Ukrainian side raised the question of 
broadening the framework of cooperation, which was fixed in a 
draft agreement proposed by the European Commission, to the 
level of conditions stipulated by appropriate agreement on 
associate membership, in particular, with Poland, Hungary, and 
other East European countries. 
  This is the first agreement on cooperation to be concluded 
with a republic of the former USSR. This agreement provides a 
reliable and large-scaled basis for the development and 
expansion of political and economic relations between the EU and 
Ukraine, and is another piece of evidence supporting democratic 
processes in independent Ukraine, as well as of the significance 
assigned to Ukraine's political and economic reforms by the EU. 
  This document underscores the importance of democratic 
values, respect for human rights, and dedication to the 
principles of market economy, and treats them as an important 
element of partnership between the EU and Ukraine. The sides 
also believe that the development and strengthening of regional 
cooperation, as well as the support of Ukraine's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity, are important 
prerequisites for the future prosperity and stability in Central 
and East Europe, as well as on the European continent as a whole. 
  The foundations were also built for full-fledged and 
mutually 
beneficial cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the wide 
realm of political, economic, and humanitarian questions; in the 
immediate future, it will be possible for Ukraine to obtain 
political support and economic assistance in its efforts to 
democratize social life and reform the economy according to 
market principles. 
  The political part of the agreement confirms the importance 
and necessity of the contribution made by both sides toward the 
consolidation of a new democratic Europe, as well as the 
development of political and economic process on the European 
continent. 
  It is a matter of principle to introduce permanent political 
dialogue and a system of regular consultations on all levels and 
in the entire network of political, economic, and other issues 
of mutual interests. 
  In the economic part of the document, the EU notes the 
important character of Ukraine's efforts to transform itself 
from a state monopoly over trade and system of centralized state 
management of the economy to a system based on market 
principles; the EU also expresses the need to render permanent 
assistance to our country in this direction. 
  The sides agreed that mutual trade will be liberalized 
according to GATT principles, while taking into account 
amendments that were introduced during the recent Uruguay round 
of negotiations. The EU will lift its restrictions on trade 
with Ukraine with the exception of so-called "sensitive" goods, 
including steel, coal, textiles, agricultural products, and 
nuclear materials. Trade in these branches will be regulated by 
special agreements, which are already prepared, or are being 
prepared, on the basis of quotas established for Ukraine. 
  On the other hand, Ukraine also has the possibility to 
introduce certain quantitative limitations in new branches of 
industry and in those branches which are subject to 
restructuring. However, it should be noted that these 
limitations may be operational in the transitional period, prior 
to 31 December 1998, or prior to the joining of GATT by Ukraine 
if this joining takes place earlier. 
  It is a well-known fact that our country attaches special 
importance to the issue of antidumping procedures in the sphere 
of expanding economic cooperation with the EU "12." Provisions 
of the economic part of the agreement testify to the positive 
stance of EU countries with regard to the solution of this 
problem. In particular, this concerns the possibility of a 
constructive and flexible mechanism for examining antidumping 
issues through consultations. 
  As market reforms in Ukraine proceed, the sides will revise 
the provisions of certain chapters, in particular, those on 
trade to create a free trade zone between the EU and Ukraine. 
Therefore, the last year of the transitional period, that is, 
1998, will see the outset of consultations on the beginning of a 
negotiating process to create a zone which can become an 
intermediate link toward the full membership of our country in 
the EU. 
  Even today we may speak about positive results in the 
relations between Ukraine and the EU. The EU Council of 
Ministers session, which preceded the signing of the agreement, 
was also devoted to the discussion of assistance to Ukraine, in 
particular, the financing of compensation capacities at the 
Rivne, Khmelnytskyy, and Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plants, 
which would be able to solve the problems of energy deliveries 
in the event of Chernobyl's shutdown. 
  Regarding the idea of Ukraine's future associate membership 
in the EU, it should be noted that the implementation of this 
idea is quite realistic. It is difficult to predict for the 
time being how far-reaching and strategic will be the 
consequences of the relations which are just beginning to take 
shape on a permanent and legal basis. First, this will depend 
to a great extent on the steadfastness and tempo of democratic 
processes and, which is especially important, of economic 
reforms in Ukraine. Second, this will also depend on the 
meeting of obligations which were made by both sides under the 
agreement. 
  The signing of this historic document opens the door for our 
future membership in the European area, but it does not 
guarantee that we will join this area. It is up to us whether 
we will be able to use this opportunity. It depends on how 
proficient we are in resolving problems, safeguarding the 
implementation of economic reforms, transforming and 
demilitarizing the economy, implementing large-scale 
privatization, and stabilizing credit and monetary sphere. 
  It is quite within the scope of our powers to do this.

of the Ukrainian Constitution, the Ukrainian president canceled 
the Crimean president's decrees No. 54 on property of the

<F P=106> [Interview with Opposition Leader Vyacheslav Chornovil by </F>
unidentified DER SPIEGEL correspondent; date, place not given: 
"Made Grave Mistakes"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chornovil, can the 
disintegration of Ukraine be halted? 
  [Chornovil] It is still possible. Yes, there is a tendency 
toward division in the Crimea, in Donbass, and in Odessa, and to 
a slighter degree also in the Transcarpathian Region. We can 
still halt the division if we begin economic reforms and the 
people's standard of living improves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will there be blood shed in the Crimea? 
  [Chornovil] This depends on how cautious the two sides are. 
I hope that the things that happened in Karabakh, Abkhazia, and 
in the Dniester region will not be repeated here. But, the 
escalation has been halted for the time being. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Due to the presidential elections? 
  [Chornovil] The Crimea's capitulation has deprived President 
Kravchuk of the possibility of installing a presidential regime 
there. Perhaps they also want to gain time. Or else, the 
people have simply become scared. They do not want bloodshed; 
this is more important than the desire for independence. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What is driving the people on the Crimea away 
from Ukraine? 
  [Chornovil] They feel cheated. They had hoped that 
independence would bring them prosperity. But if it smells of 
blood, the man in the street would rather not get involved in 
separatism. But still the situation in the Crimea continues to 
be very tense. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What mistakes has the Ukrainian government 
made regarding the Crimea problem? 
  [Chornovil] Very grave mistakes, one after the other. The 
first one was granting the Crimea territorial autonomy. That 
was illogical. If there had to be autonomy, it should have been 
based on the autochthonous population -- that is the Crimea 
Tartars. That is how all the autonomous regions in the Soviet 
Union were created, on the basis of their original population. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Russians are only immigrants in the 
Crimea. 
  [Chornovil] Autonomy for immigrants, that was the first 
mistake. Then, elections for a Crimean president were 
permitted. But such an office is not even mentioned in the 
Ukrainian constitution. Without the elections, all that would 
not have occurred. There has been nothing but mistakes so far. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you consider Kravchuk incompetent? 
  [Chornovil] He tried to do something too late. Parliament 
authorized him to annul the rulings of the Crimean president 
back in January. Today, Kravchuk no longer has the situation 
under control. He is incapable of making decisions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You would have advised him to take drastic 
steps? 
  [Chornovil] I am not in favor of risking an armed 
confrontation no matter what. One could have taken other 
determined measures. But Kravchuk is putting everything off, 
thinking: It is going to work out somehow. He is too weak. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you advocating a presidential regime, 
putting the Crimea directly under Kiev's control? 
  [Chornovil] This should have been done six months ago, but 
even today such a step could signal decisiveness. But now a 
great many people from Russia have arrived in the Crimea, many 
Moscovites are involved in the administration there. Russian 
Cossacks are hanging around there. But there is no way the 
Crimea should have its own armed forces. The Ukrainian Army is 
the only army that should be stationed on the Crimea. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What about dual citizenship for the people in 
the Crimea? 
  [Chornovil] This must be rejected. There must be only 
Ukrainian citizenship on Ukrainian territory. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How do you rate Kravchuk's ability to govern 
this country? 
  [Chornovil] In terms of foreign policy, he is undoubtedly a 
capable politician. But his attempt to control the economy has 
proved to be a complete failure. Kravchuk is not an economist, 
and he is not very capable of making decisions. That is one of 
the reasons the reforms have failed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But nevertheless you are supporting him in the 
presidential elections. 
  [Chornovil] That is not quite right. My organization "Rukh" 
[Ukraine People's Movement] has decided to support the candidate 
who is in favor of reforms and preserving the state. We have 
not expressly spoken out for Kravchuk. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And what if there is a decisive ballot between 
him and former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma? 
  [Chornovil] In that case, we will support Kravchuk. He is 
the lesser of two evils. We consider the candidacy of socialist 
Oleksandr Moros and Kuchma to be extremely dangerous, because 
they are backed by apologists of the Russian empire. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why has Rukh not nominated a candidate of its 
own? 
  [Chornovil] We do not have a constitution that clearly 
establishes the president's tasks. That is why we think the 
elections are being held too early. We would not stand any real 
chance in the presidential election either, because we, the 
democrats, are blamed for the catastrophic economic situation. 
That is why we are saying: These are not our elections yet. 
Our opportunity is still to come.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Ukrainian Navy Commander Borys </F>
Kozhyn, member of the Ukrainian Supreme Council Commission for 
Issues of Defense and National Security, by Oleksiy Dashkovskyy; 
place and date not given: "Kravchuk's Last Chance"] 
  [Text] "President Leonid Kravchuk, accompanied by his 
high-level ministers, should go to the Crimea immediately to 
resolve all questions, including problems of the Black Sea 
Fleet," former Ukrainian Navy Commander Borys Kozhyn, member of 
both the Rukh faction and Supreme Council Commission for Issues 
of Defense and National Security, has told our correspondent. 
  [Dashkovskyy] As everybody knows, the latest negotiations in 
Moscow on the division of the Black Sea Fleet did not produce 
any results. Negotiations between expert groups, at the level 
of naval commanders, have recently begun in Sevastopol. What 
position should Ukraine assume to avoid the role of a "younger 
sister," and simultaneously, to conclude previous agreements? 
  [Kozhyn] Our state should stand on a position of parity and 
not allow Russian representatives to dictate their terms, 
because all military units deployed on Ukrainian territory 
belong to our state, and this relates to the Black Sea Fleet, 
first and foremost. When the fleet finally belongs to us not 
only de jure but also de facto, our goal will be for an 
appropriate Supreme Council commission to decide which 
commitments, concerning guarantees for security and 
inviolability of borders, Russia should undertake. Only after 
that is done will it be possible to talk about certain 
reasonable compromises. 
  [Dashkovskyy] At a closed session of the Supreme Council, 
Leonid Kravchuk spoke in favor of transferring control of 
Sevastopol's naval base and onshore infrastructure to Russia... 
  [Kozhyn] The president voiced his opinion on the situation, 
but the final decision is to be made by the Supreme Council. 
Personally, I am against such a transfer, because the one who 
rules Sevastopol and its naval base, dominates the Black Sea. 
Besides, everyone should respect international agreements. 
Soon after the 1991 Moscow putsch, during the official meeting 
of CIS heads of state in Belavezha, Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus 
signed an entire range of agreements, including one stating that 
every state is the sole owner of all property located on its 
territory, and one concerning the inviolability of borders. It 
is interesting how the world community would react if Moscow 
demanded that the Baykonur launch-site be divided between Russia 
and Kazakhstan?! Moreover, I generally stand for the gradual 
withdrawal (taking into account servicemen's problems) of 
Russian units from Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea. 
  [Dashkovskyy] The maintenance of the Black Sea Fleet 
requires considerable expenditures, and particularly, the 
question of fuel arises under the current acute energy crisis. 
  [Kozhyn] As everybody knows, almost 70 percent of maritime 
nation's fuel resources is spent on maintenance of navies. On 
the other hand, we must not go too far, because there are other 
important sectors. As of today, the balance is maintained -- 
state organizations allot funds, and moreover, the Black Sea 
Fleet is fully maintained by Ukraine. 
  [Dashkovskyy] What, in your opinion, must be done to prevent 
a "Ukrainian Karabakh" from developing in the Crimea? 
  [Kozhyn] I would not advise anyone to inflame passions 
surrounding the Crimea, which is currently being done quite 
successfully by the Russian media. The government's position 
should be weighed, but tough. When I was still the Navy 
commander, I warned the previous Supreme Council of possible 
dangerous consequences stemming from Crimean autonomy, and I 
insisted that this issue be revised. Since all problems must be 
resolved in a peaceful manner, I believe that the president must 
go to the Crimea. If Leonid Kravchuk does not do that in the 
near future, he will bear responsibility for any further 
developments. In my opinion, this is the last chance to 
preserve our independence, peace, and accord.

  [Text] Kiev, 20 June -- The Ukrainian president has issued 
a decree on urgent measures to return to Ukraine hard currency 
valuables which are illegally held abroad. The decree, in 
particular states: 
  The president resolves: 
  1. That corporate bodies of Ukraine, irrespective of their 
form of ownership, should within 10 days declare to the National 
Bank of Ukraine the availability or absence (with a definition 
of the amount) of all hard currency valuables that belong to 
them and that are held outside Ukraine, including those received 
as a result of carrying out entrepreneurial activity beyond 
Ukraine's borders. 
  2. To provide the main state tax inspectorate of Ukraine 
with a declaration of funds held in their accounts by banks and 
other foreign financial institutions, and also of hard currency 
revenues in the form of income and dividends received as a 
result of carrying out entrepreneurial activity beyond Ukraine's 
borders. Henceforth such declarations are to be carried out 
every three months. 
  The National Bank of Ukraine and the main state tax 
inspectorate of Ukraine are to ensure that strict confidence is

supplied by corporate bodies in compliance with Article 1 of 
this decree. 
  5. Ukraine's Ministry of Statistics, in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Finance and the National Bank, are to approve and 
introduce as of the third quarter of 1994 a system of quarterly 
accounts by all corporate bodies on the receipt of hard currency

Supreme Council of Ukraine within a week a draft law on the 
increase of liability for concealment and illegal use of hard 
currency proceeds by Ukraine's corporate bodies. 
  8. Where the requirements set out in Articles 1 and 3 of 
this decree are complied with, no sanctions envisaged by the 
current legislation are imposed on corporate bodies, and their 
managers or officials do not face criminal or other forms of

  [Text] Lugansk -- Oleksandr Moroz, candidate for president 
and chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council, arrived in Lugansk on 
17 June. He had his first meeting at the "Tsentralna-Irmine" 
mine. Then he went to the joint-stock enterprise "Styl" and met 
electors at the diesel locomotive construction workers' palace 
of culture. During this meeting he set forth his vision of 
getting Ukraine out of the crisis, subjected his rivals' 
programs to criticism and replied to numerous questions. He 
also introduced the team, which had arrived with him and to 
which belong, according to him, "lawyers of world renown" and 
employees of ministries. 
  Oleksandr Moroz stated that to begin with, he would bring 
order and discipline to the state. Calling on the future 
electors to cast their votes for ideas, in which they believe, 
Oleksandr Moroz said: "I am not going to say directly that you 
should vote for representatives of leftist forces." 
  Regarding the fate of the Black Sea Fleet, the Ukrainian 
parliament Speaker said that the fleet should be a joint one and 
should protect the interests of both Russia and Ukraine. 
  Acknowledging the preservation of the sovereignty of former 
Soviet Union republics, Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman 
stated that the peoples of these republics should help one 
another and then they would manage to remove customs-houses and 
borders in the future. "We will restore accord between the two 
states and other fraternal peoples, while not conceding 
sovereignty," he said. 
  Oleksandr Moroz promised to conduct checks on the 
privatization process in the country. According to him, a 
special commission would be set up and an analysis of 
privatization would be carried out. Those, who had privatized 
enterprises and shops, would be asked where they got the funds 
from. "If they cannot account for the sources of finance, they 
will have to part from the privatized facilities and even do 
time in jail," Ukraine's Supreme Council chairman said. 
  As far as foreign currency is concerned, the Speaker 
promised 
to ban the use of both the U.S. dollar and the Deutschmark for 
settlements in Ukraine the very next day after his election to 
president. 
  Of all of the candidates for president, whom Oleksandr Moroz 
described, Volodymyr Lanovyy got the worst of it. He was called 
"an individual with an unbalanced psyche." 
  A meeting with managers of the oblast's and town's 
enterprises took place on the same day.

  [Text] Ukrainian Parliament speaker and candidate to the 
presidential post Aleksandr Moroz has denied reports by 
Ostankino TV company that he may remove his candidacy and 
support Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "This is a canard of which I was informed last week," he 
told 
electors in Zaporozhye. 
  "I respect all candidates to the presidential post, but I

<F P=106> [Statement released by the "Ukrayina" democratic coalition; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Seeing the indecisiveness of authorities and their 
unwillingness to strengthen the foundations of statehood in the 
regions, anti-Ukrainian and antistate forces have stepped up 
their activities in Kharkov Oblast. They threw off their mask 
during the Supreme Council elections in March and April this 
year. The Civil Congress of Ukraine, the Labor Party, the 
Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, and 
the leadership of the United Trade Unions of Kharkov Oblast have 
waged a furious propaganda campaign against Ukraine's 
independence, the state leadership, and the population of 
western oblasts. A great number of Ukrainian-eaters 
[Ukrayinozher], with the help of proimperial magnates, have 
infiltrated our state's legislative body -- the Supreme Council. 
They can be easily recognized by their deeds: In parliament, 
they behave in a blatant manner, speak only in Russian, and 
voice opinions which can lead to destabilization of political 
life and loss of Ukrainian statehood, and can transform Ukraine 
into an economic appendage of the Russian empire. 
  In terms of ideology, these deputies are fed by similar 
forces in the regions. In Kharkov Oblast, the proimperial 
forces have almost completely captured the media -- they have 
established the "Tonis," "Orion," "Symon," "Vympel," and "A/TVK" 
television companies and the "Radio 50," "Master-Radio," and 
"Onyks" radio companies. VECHERNIY KHARKOV and SOBYTIYE are 
published instead of such Ukrainian-language newspapers as 
VECHIRNIY KHARKOV and LENINSKA ZMINA. A whole range of new 
Russian-language newspapers are published. Newspapers from 
Russia are sold for pittance. Russian literature dominates the 
city's and oblast's bookstands. At state expense, libraries are 
furnished with Russian papers, magazines, and books. Only two 
Ukrainian newspapers -- SLOBIDSKYY KRAY (three times per week) 
and children's ZHURAVLYK (twice per month) -- are published in 
Kharkov. The attack against the Ukrainian language is conducted 
by physical methods as well: The stands, on which Ukrainian 
newspapers were displayed, have been dismantled. 
  We, the plenipotentiaries of political parties and public 
organizations of democratic orientation, are concerned over the 
attack of proimperial forces in Kharkov Oblast. 
  We Propose: 
  To the Cabinet of Ministers: 
  1. To hold a special meeting concerning the implementation 
of the "State Program for the Development of the Ukrainian 
Language and Other National Languages of Ukraine by the year of 
2000" dated 12 November 1991. 
  2. To provide state assistance to Ukrainian-language media, 
to ensure their normal operation. 
  To the Supreme Council: 
  1. To revise the issue of using the technical radio and 
television equipment on the Ukrainian territory, which is used 
to hamper the process of Ukrainian national revival, cultivate 
separatism, and sow hostilities among people in different parts 
of the state. 
  2. To ensure the introduction of the state language at 
plenary sessions of the parliament and its standing commissions.

  [Text] Kiev -- Mykhaylo Pavlovskyy, chairman of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council Commission for Nuclear Safety and Nuclear 
Policy, informed a UNIAN correspondent in an interview on 20 
June that the main tasks now facing the commission are the 
organization of the safe work of nuclear power stations (the 
burial of nuclear waste is included in this too) and the 
elaboration of a concept of the development of power engineering 
as a whole, and nuclear power in particular. 
  Regarding parliament's possible rejection of Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as a 
non-nuclear state, Pavlovskyy replied: "This issue will not be 
raised. There can be no going back." (As UNIAN has already 
reported, deputies from the Union of Officers of Ukraine are to 
address an initiative to parliament on Ukraine returning to 
nuclear status.) 
  Concerning international assistance in converting facilities 
of the military-industrial complex, in the opinion of the 
commission chairman, efficient assistance is that which is 
directed at specific programs. However, he believes that one 
can hardly expect such targeted assistance in the near future.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz June 17 TASS -- At a meeting held here 
today between North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and 
Russian First Deputy Interior Minister Colonel-General Yevgeniy 
Abramov, they discussed the implementation of the Russian 
presidential decree on "the introduction of an emergency 
situation in a part of the territory of the North Ossetian and 
Ingush republics" issued on May 30, 1994. 
  This document empowers the Russian Interior Ministry, the 
Federal Counter-espionage Service and the provisional 
administration forces from the russian defence ministry, to take 
measures to prevent armed clashes between hostile sides, to 
ensure the safety of civilians and the strict observance of the 
emergency rules and regulations. 
  According to Yevgeniy Abramov, the Russian presidential 
decree on the return of refugees and Russian Federation 
Government decisions to implementing the decree must be carried 
out. However, refugees should not be simply returned to their 
villages, but their security and normal living conditions should 
also be ensured. The minister expressed concern over the large 
quantity of arms possessed by the population, and over the 
activities of unlawful armed formations, which are trying to 
destabilize the situation and undermine the implementation of 
the Russian presidential decree.

<F P=106> [Item from roundup of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, ITAR-TASS reports </F>
under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric: "Far Easterners 
Discuss Incentives"] 
  [Text] A draft presidential edict "On Special Measures in 
Managing the Socioeconomic Development of the Far East and 
Transbaykal in 1994-1995" was discussed yesterday at a session 
of the Interregional Association for Economic Collaboration 
Between Federation Components in the Far East and Transbaykal. 
  Territory leaders believe that it is essential to set 
uniform 
electricity and heat tariffs for Siberia and the Far East, to 
recompense from the budget 50 percent of the expenditure 
incurred both on importing fuel and foodstuffs into the region 
and on exporting produce made here, and to repay the debt owed 
by the federal budget to state sector enterprises. The draft 
also provides for restrictions on tax deductions from profits, 
and customs and tax incentives.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Wages for South Urals Defense </F>
Workers"] 
  [Text] Some 230 billion rubles have been transferred for 
the express purposes of extinguishing indebtedness in respect of 
wages due to workers at defense enterprises in the South Urals. 
This was announced by Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Astakhov 
at a joint sitting of the government commission, the Chelyabinsk 
Oblast leadership, and defense sector enterprise directors. 
Thus, the first step toward remedying the critical situation 
prevailing here has been taken. 
  The arrival of an authoritative Russian Government 
commission 
at one of the country's leading industrial regions and its tour 
of a number of major enterprises and the Defense Complex Design 
Bureau was seen by Igor Velichko, general designer at the State 
Missile Center, as a show of genuine interest on the part of the 
leadership of ministries and departments in ensuring the 
stabilization of the work of the military-industrial complex.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Davidyuk report: "Better a Hard Shipping Season </F>
Than a `Nightmare' Winter -- Obstacles on the `Lifeline' for the 
Far North Garrisons"] 
  [Text] Spring was late arriving in Tiksi. And this means 
that in the remaining six to eight weeks every necessity, from 
tacks to fuel, will have to be brought to the northern garrisons 
of the Transbaykal Military District. The lion's share of 
freight for the "God-forsaken" polar region is conveyed by ship 
along the Lena river. The waterway is virtually the only route 
into these regions. At the very least, it is the cheapest. 
  "A great deal of work rests on the servicemen's shoulders. 
We will have to ship around 55,000 tonnes of fuel and 
lubricants, over 2,000 tonnes of food, personal equipment, 
medicines, and much much more. In all, this represents 60,000 
tonnes of cargo," Colonel General Valeriy Tretyakov, commander 
of the Transbaykal Military District, told me in conversation. 
"On top of all that, the river workers have sprung an 
unpleasant `surprise' -- prices for conveying cargoes have shot 
up." 
  But although they have managed somehow to cope with the 
transportation payments -- Moscow allocated some money -- the 
fact is that everyday welfare problems are somewhat more 
pressing. It is no secret to anybody that Northerners are 
abandoning their local areas and moving away. They are moving 
to the former Union republics and to the richer cities. Their 
actions are understandable. The wage, for instance, of a 
kindergarten teacher stands at 150,000 rubles. Officers' and 
ensigns' pay is just 50,000 rubles more than for their 
colleagues in other regions. Priority provision of consumer 
goods is a thing of the past. Food products and fruit and 
vegetables are two or three times more expensive than "on the 
mainland." Add to this the climatic conditions.... 
  There is a dire shortage of experienced specialists and 
highly skilled workers readying the garrisons of the Far North 
for the long winter. A similar picture can be seen in the troop 
collectives. Things are particularly difficult when it comes to 
filling jobs for enlisted men and NCO's. Every draftee tries by 
hook or by crook to serve just that bit closer to home. The 
soldiers who remain are those from among the handful of Arctic 
peoples. But they are too few in number to "plug the gaps" in 
personnel numbers. 
  The conditions being generated by the military leadership 
should also be mentioned. Among the most important is the 
reduction in the number of small garrisons lost in the tundra or 
deep in the taiga. An agreement has been reached with welders 
and workers in other trades from Belorussia [Belarus]. They 
will be traveling to Yakutia soon to help prepare the military 
camps for the winter. Officers from all the district rear 
services in the okrug and the people responsible for shipping 
military freight along the "lifeline" route are out working on 
the spot. 
  ...The shipping season looks set to be difficult. But it is 
better for the shipping to season to be hard than the 
forthcoming winter.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Beldyugina: "`Warm Climes' Going Under </F>
Lock and Key. Stavropol Kray Preparing for Introduction of Visa 
Regulations"] 
  [Text] Stavropol Kray's State Duma Committee for 
Legislation and Human Rights has prepared a package of documents 
confirming the status of this vast border kray as a territory 
with special immigration regulations. 
  This resolute attempt to bring immigration under strict 
control was the result of a significant deterioration in social 
welfare and the level of crime here. Deputies consider that one 
main, if not the main reason for this is the uncontrolled and 
barely verifiable process of rapid settlement of this land of 
plenty by citizens of former USSR republics, in particular from 
the Transcaucasus. 
  What is more, you cannot in any way classify those coming to 
the kray to settle permanently as unfortunate, dispossessed 
refugees and forced migrants. During the years 1990-1993 almost 
500,000 people moved to the kray as permanent residents, but 
only 10 percent of them are registered at the kray immigration 
service as forced migrants. Only about 2,500 have officially 
registered as Russian citizens, while the remainder are citizens 
of other CIS states. There are people living within Russia who 
are, it would seem, free from the obligations of Russian 
Federation citizens, in particular military service. Young 
people who dodge the draft feel "unrestrained" in everything 
else as well. Very often they come into conflict with the law 
and public moral standards. This provokes genuine revulsion 
among the indigenous population of the towns and villages, who 
often turn against all "ethnics" in general. Reports about 
village assemblies ending in ultimatums and demands that 
"outsiders" be evicted from this or that population center are 
all over the local press. 
  Unregulated mass immigration is causing the general quality 
of life in the kray to deteriorate sharply. You are struck by 
the unusually high prices for the south of food in the markets 
and of manufactured and household goods in the stores. Prices 
here are higher than in Moscow and other Russian industrial 
centers, and incomes are a lot lower. 
  But even this is not the main point: The whole of Stavropol 
Kray's infrastructure is bursting at the seams. A minimum of 40 
new schools and an even greater number of kindergartens need to 
be constructed for the immigrants' children -- there has been an 
increase of 40,000 children in the past three years. A further 
9 billion rubles are required for medical services for the 
newcomers. But the kray's treasury is empty. 
  Yet many of the newcomers immediately buy up individual 
homes, garages, plots of land to build on, luxury dachas, and 
other real estate. Information about this in the possession of 
the service for fighting organized crime, which for the moment 
cannot be disclosed as there is a secret investigation in 
progress, is -- take my word for it -- very impressive. 
  Representatives of many kray departments, parties, 
movements, 
and members of the intelligentsia participated in the stormy 
parliamentary hearings on problems of immigration. Practically 
all the participants came out in favor of introducing special 
immigration regulations. With the exception of Yevgeniy 
Borodin, cochairman of the kray organization of the "Democratic 
Russia" movement. He considers that the proposed measures are 
not in keeping with the Russian Federation Constitution and 
infringe human rights. He sees a danger in overzealous 
officials' introducing visa regulations "with a strong element 
of Russian nationalism." For example, Professor A. Avksentyev, 
who is well-known in these parts, stated directly: "In 
immigration, priority should be given to the Russian population, 
and all others should be regarded as having foreign status...." 
  The motivation of the advocates of the "Russified approach" 
is equally serious: The proportion of Russians in the overall 
population of this kray, where more than 100 peoples and 
nationalities live, has begun to fall in recent years. There is 
also every sign that this trend will strengthen. What is more 
this is a trend with a clear criminal coloration. Corrupt 
Stavropol officials are accepting enormous bribes to grant 
inhabitants of the Transcaucasus -- people who are on the whole 
well-to-do -- permits to live in cities and population centers 
in the Mineralnyye Vody area of the Caucasus. Although there is 
a strict quota for residence permits here, this proves to be no 
obstacle. The quota has been exceeded twice over in the past 
three years. 
  The deputies propose introducing different payments for 
residence permits in different regions while stepping up the 
monitoring process to check that quotas are adhered to. In the 
kray center it will cost immigrants from Russia 500 times the 
minimum wage, while it will cost immigrants from the CIS 1,000 
times and foreigners 2,500 times the minimum wage. It is 
proposed to permit the entry of foreign citizens, including 
those from former USSR republics, and persons without 
citizenship only on production of an invitation from an 
inhabitant of the kray or a corporate body registered there. It 
will only be possible to register for permanent residence with 
the backing of an enterprise, organization, a state or municipal 
body, or relatives. A mechanism has also been produced to expel 
from the territory people who have gone there without a visa. 
  The participants in the hearings complained once more about 
the legal mess over the border between Russia and Chechnya and 
again appealed to the Russian Government. "It is absolutely 
essential to finally determine our position vis-a-vis Chechnya," 
Nikolay Novoseltsev, hetman of the kray Cossack union, said 
indignantly. "If this is a republic which is part of Russia, 
order must be established there; if it is not, the border with 
it must be firmly closed." 
  The situation really is unbearable: A wave of violence, 
robbery, and murder is spreading unimpeded from Chechnya across 
the whole of southern Russia. After making their "raids," the 
criminals hide there on its territory and feel absolutely safe 
there. It is not as if the borders here were "transparent." 
  So the Stavropol deputies and public have approved the 
legislative base for immigration regulations produced by the 
duma committee. In the opinion of committee chairman Viktor 
Khloponi, a well-known kray specialist on combating organized 
crime and corruption, the local parliament will examine the 
question of introducing the visa regulations at its next session.

Introduces Own Privatization"] 
  [Text] The kray legislative assembly session yesterday 
adopted the "Law on the Privatization of State Enterprises in 
Altay Kray." 
  It envisages the sale of privatized property solely for 
money, since vouchers are now past their validity date. 
Privatization methods have been widened to include methods not 
contained in the corresponding Russian law. They are contracts, 
transfer of packages of enterprise shares to private control, 
step-by-step privatization of loss-making and low-profit 
enterprises, and privatization involving the process of dividing 
up debts and property. The adoption of this kind of law at 
regional level is unprecedented in Russia.

possibility of turning the Commonwealth of Independent States 
into a Eurasian community. Arkadiy Volskiy, chairman and 
coordinator of the International Congress of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, Nikolay Ryzhkov, chairman of the Moscow 
Intellectual-Business Club, and Timur Pulatov, first secretary

Community of Writers Unions, were among the main speakers.

  [Text] Moscow, June 12, RIA -- Russian President's Press 
Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov and Head of the Presidential 
Administration Sergey Filatov were present today at the founding 
congress of Russia's Democratic Choice Party [RDCP]. However, 
neither did they address the congress, nor did they make any 
statements on the president's behalf. 
  "I'm not a bit surprised that Russia's Democratic Choice 
Party has received no congratulations on its creation. Our 
relations with him (the president) are good and constructive 
enough so as to do without such curtsies," the party's leader, 
Yegor Gaydar, told a briefing today. 
  "Such congratulation messages are usually prepared by those 
being congratulated," Sergey Filatov told a RIA correspondent, 
adding that it's not worth paying that much attention to the 
absence of such a message.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has told 
Interfax that he will sign not only the NATO Partnership for 
Peace program but also a protocol to another program, 
Russia-NATO, worked out by Russian officials in Brussels on June 
22. 
  Kozyrev will leave for Brussels on June 21. Kozyrev said his 
main purpose in Brussels was to sign the protocol to the 
Russia-NATO program. 
  Kozyrev may leave Brussels for Corfu instead of Moscow in 
order to join Russian President Boris Yeltsin who will 
participate in the EU summit and sign an agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between Russia and the EU. 
  A high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
All- European Cooperation Department told Interfax that the 
Russia-NATO program transmitted to the NATO headquarters a month 
ago was a "sound document reflecting our vision of relations 
with NATO, Russia's place in Europe and in the world."

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1625 GMT on 20 June carries a 10-minute "Details" 
program which features an interview with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev by correspondent Vera Kuznetsova. 
  Asked whether Russia's position at the Partnership for Peace 
talks has weakened with regard to NATO, and whether this is the 
reason why he is rushing off to Brussels, Kozyrev replies: 
  "What rush? There is no rush. To begin with, most other 
states have already signed, only a few remain. We are trailing 
right at the back of this process. But I don't think that this 
has happened because we have been asleep or idle all this time. 
Simply we have our own difficulties. It is one thing if a 
small poodle tries to walk through these gates, but quite 
another matter when an elephant like Russia tries to do the same 
thing. 
  "No one is rushing us, and we are in absolutely no hurry, 
but 
we are not falling behind either. We have no such objectives. 
We have a completely different objective, purely and simply 
pragmatic. We believe that when NATO came to understand our 
logic, and when we were able to work out the documents, such as 
the framework -- well, that was not real work, but still, we 
had to weigh up, consider, and discuss everything. So, when we 
worked out this protocol, we then signed it when we were ready. 
  "Is it right that everyone is offered the same document? 
Some people here believe that we should not sign such a 
document because, they say, mighty Russia should not sign just 
like other states. Well, I don't even know which is more 
prevalent here, ignorance or cheap arrogance. If we talk about 
the practical reason, well, then the situation is somewhat 
different. I had to have an urgent meeting with the U.S. 
secretary of state on an absolutely unrelated matter, namely 
Korea. We are such a huge country, and this is obviously 
acknowledged in this protocol. Eastern politics are as close to 
us as those of the West, because Korea is also near abroad for 
us, if you want. When one goes to Vladivostok, it becomes clear 
that if something happens on the Korean peninsula, bomb blasts 
will be heard there as well." 
  After a comment by program presenter Sergey Dorenko to the 
effect that Russia's present position with regard to NATO could 
equally be interpreted as a weakening of a formerly militant and 
harsh stance, or as a great diplomatic victory, Kozyrev 
concludes: 
  "There will be no economic G-8 summit this time, and I must 
say that we were ready for this. However, half of the entire 
agenda is already meant to include eight countries. I must say 
that after two years of Russia's existence in its new capacity, 
that is not a bad result."

  [Text] Moscow hopes that soon after the Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev signs the Partnership For Peace program in 
Brussels on Wednesday yet another program "Russia-NATO" will be 
signed. 
  As a senior foreign ministry official has recalled in an 
interview with INTERFAX, the "Russia-NATO" program was submitted 
to NATO's Headquarters just a month ago. "This substantive 
document mirrors our vision of relations with NATO, Russia's 
role and place in Europe and elsewhere. It would certainly be 
lovely to sign two programs at once, but the men at NATO will 
apparently need time to study the Russian proposals. So, we do 
not dramatize the situation, nor do we intend to spur events 
deliberately," the diplomat said. 
  He did not rule out that in Brussels Kozyrev and NATO 
leaders 
might sign a declaration of intent to promote cooperation and 
partnership. "We feel the Russia-NATO program could be the 
platform for that," he said.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian Federation 
Council today met behind closed doors to debate the sending of 
Russian troops to Abkhazia to police the zone of conflict 
between Georgia and its break-away autonomy. The upper house 
eventually approved the move. 
  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists that the 
absolute majority in the upper chamber voted for conducting the 
peace-keeping operation in the region". 
  "To me, this is an order to act," Grachev said. "As soon as 
the mine-clearing operation is reported over, we will get down 
to the peace-keeping operation proper, including posting 
sentries and setting up checkpoints," he said. 
  The defence minister said that the operation will begin with 
the relocation of two battalions from Batumi and paratroopers 
from Gudauta. Later, two more battalions will be airlifted from 
the Leningrad and Privolzhskiy (Volga) Military Districts to 
reinforce the group. A total of 3000 men will take part in the 
peace-keeping mission in Abkhazia. 
  Grachev said preparatory work was done over the past few 
days, particularly as concerns the mine-clearing operation which 
defused a great amount of explosives and bombs in the area. 
Control points were set up, communication lines laid and 
material and other resources were stocked. 
  Asked about the funding of the peace-keeping operation in 
Abkhazia, the defence minister expressed the hope that the 
deputies would soon adopt a decision on funding the mission from 
sources other than the ministry's budget. He said the mission 
would require the outlay of 10 to 11 billion roubles until the 
end of this year. 
  It is not yet clear whether other Commonwealth member states 
will take part in the mission, Grachev said. But the question 
about it will be raised at the Commonwealth summit in September, 
the minister said.

  [Text] Comrat BASAPRESS, 16/6/1994 -- Yesterday Dumitru 
Motpan, Moldovan Parliament deputy speaker [and chairman of the 
ruling Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- PDAM], took part 
in a Comrat conference of agricultural-industrial managers 
dedicated to agricultural reform. In his speech, Motpan said 
that "in the near future the Chisinau Parliament will examine 
the draft law on official language with a series of 
modifications introduced by the responsible parliamentary 
commission." The current law on official language was approved 
by Moldova's Parliament on 31 August 1989. It does not contain 
the term "attestation." This term was later added by the 
Language Department and now is perceived by non-Romanian ethnics 
as a scarecrow, said Dumitru Motpan. Asked about what kind of 
modifications were made, Motpan told BASAPRESS that first "the 
period for studying Romanian will be prolonged through 1996 to 
enable people to perform their duties." The requirement to know 
the language of the population in localities where officials 
perform their duty is valid for all leaders regardless of their 
nationality, stated Dumitru Motpan. The Gagauz-eri-Gagaouzia 
draft law stipulates that the local administration will use 
Gagaouzian and Russian in its office work. Correspondence with 
the Moldovan leadership and economic units will be made in the 
official language and Russian.

  [Text] Kyrgyz Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov called on 
Japanese businessmen to play a part in reforming his country's 
economy. When he met with them in Bishkek Monday [20 June], he 
called on Japanese businessmen to invest in the reconstruction 
of defense, engineering and food processing industries. 
  Dzhumagulov believed that as little as 7 to 8 pct of the 
country's rushing water is used to generate electricity and that 
Japanese participation in construction of small, medium, and 
large hydro power stations would be profitable to both countries. 
  He also invited them to invest in the construction of a 
factory manufacturing semi-conductors in the south of Kyrgyzstan. 
  Dzhumagulov emphasized that he pinned great hopes on the 
Kyrgyz-Japanese Economic Cooperation Commission, which he heads. 
He will attend its session in Tokyo next November. 
  Dzhumagulov said that the government had set up a 
reconstruction and development bank which reflects the Japanese 
way of doing things. The bank will mobilize state resources to 
finance and credit priority projects and support small and 
medium business in priority fields.

  [Text] The murder of military personnel and state officials 
in Tajikistan has become an epidemic. Three republican Internal 
Affairs Ministry officials were killed in a Dushanbe suburb the 
other day. Two others are still missing. Another 12 people 
have been injured as a result of a sortie by Tajik opposition 
guerrillas. All this is despite highly encouraging information 
arriving from Tehran, where inter-Tajik talks are being held. 
  [Nikulin] A series of acts of terrorism have been committed 
in Tajikistan since the start of June. The principal victims 
have been servicemen of the collective peacekeeping forces, the 
Russian border troops and the Tajik Defense Ministry. These 
incidents worried the public at large. Nobody in the Republic 
doubts that these deeds were carefully planned in advance and 
that their aim is to destabilize the sociopolitical situation 
and to wreck the second round of inter-Tajik talks which has 
begun in Tehran. 
  Concerned at the rampage of crime, foreign missions and 
embassies accredited in Tajikistan are taking steps to guarantee 
the safety of their staff. The U.S. State Department has even 
advised its citizens to avoid trips to this Central Asian 
republic for the time being. But, no doubt, the greatest alarm 
at the events taking place here is felt at the Russian Embassy. 
After all, most of the officers who have been killed by 
terrorists have been Russian. 
  [Sinkevich] As ambassador, I have every reason to state 
quite authoritatively, on behalf of my government, that Russia 
will not sit idly by. It will take all necessary steps to 
guarantee the safety of Russian servicemen and our 
fellow-countrymen. Russia reserves the right to use all the 
resources at its disposal to this end. We hope that the same 
resources will be deployed by the Government of Tajikistan.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "GOLOS ARMENII" dailies), 
06/18/94 -- Three delegations of the World Bank have arrived to 
Yerevan together with its representative to Armenia Vahram 
Nersisyan. 
  Before implementation, World Bank projects need to have 
analytic basis, which is being prepared by mentioned delegations. 
  One of them will be dealing with a social investment 
program, 
mainly to alleviate the consequences of privatization and, 
particularly, to slow down the increasing unemployment rate. 
The other delegation will prepare a project of economic 
structural changes. Third will investigate the current economic 
conditions in the republic and prepare measures for economic 
improvements. 
  In Vahram Nersisyan's opinion, some $50-100 mln are needed 
for general economic improvements in Armenia. Nevertheless, 
large credits are difficult to obtain, as sources of finances 
are not quite sure they will be able to get their money back 
consistently and in time. 
  Credits for mentioned preparatory operations are given not 
to 
the government of the republic, but to executive organizations 
and their foreign specialists. In other words, the credit is 
given to Armenia, but the money is paid to foreign specialists, 
who work for development of projects for Armenia. The debt is, 
naturally, to be paid by Armenia. 
  Armenia is not the only country in the region, which 
appeared 
in such conditions. The World Bank will give a similar credit 
to support structural changes in Azerbaijan, which will have to 
pay it back in the same way. 
  According to the Armenian representative of the World Bank, 
these are "first window" credits. "Second window" credits will 
provide money to financial structures of the republic. Similar 
credits have been particularly received by Russia and Baltic 
republics. Armenia has never received such credits so far. 
Structural changes credit of $12 mln., $28 mln. credit for the 
earthquake zone and $40 mln. for the irrigation system project 
have been allocated for Armenia. The latter has not been 
affirmed yet, but $1.5 mln. have already been allocated for 
analytic work. Another $30 mln. of energy credit is to be 
acknowledged by the end of the year. 
  Vahram Nersisyan promises that, if peace is stable, he will 
aspire to doubling and tripling the credits to Armenia so that 
it receives $200-300 mln. from the World Bank yearly.

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with State Council Chairman Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, it can be said that 
the first tangible steps in an Abkhaz peace settlement were made 
last week. [passage omitted] Was the latest agreement what the 
country needed? Was it something you were looking for? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. Let me remind you 
that we did not enter Abkhazia for war. The war with the Abkhaz 
is as meaningless and absurd as was the adventurist war against 
the Ossetians which was started irresponsibly. The most 
persuasive argument in favor of what I said is the fact that we 
signed peace accords at the time when we still held positions on 
the River Psou. That document was in full agreement with the 
interests of both Georgia and the Abkhaz people. 
  Our further efforts were also aimed at a peaceful settlement 
of the conflict. I said from the outset that a war between the 
Georgians and Abkhaz was inadmissible. What happened? Why were 
we punished so cruelly despite the fact that the entire world, 
including the UN and other international organizations, 
supported us? 
  Georgia's biggest mistake after the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union was to pursue a reckless policy toward Russia. 
This was not state diplomacy, but street diplomacy, if I may 
put it so. It was impossible to change that policy in a short 
period of time. It became the main reason for all our troubles. 
  A lot has changed since then. That defect in Georgian state 
policy was eliminated. We are now building friendly and good- 
neighborly relations with Russia which are based on mutual 
trust. Apart from that, Georgia has become a member of the CIS 
and the Collective Security Council. One of the main tasks of 
these international regional organizations is to guarantee the 
territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of member 
states. [passage omitted] 
  It should be taken into account that the Abkhaz side is an 
active and fairly constructive participant in political 
dialogue. There have already been several meetings in Geneva, 
Moscow, Sochi, and elsewhere, and they have produced certain 
results. War and instability are ruinous not only for Georgia 
but also for the Abkhazes, and they know this full well. 
  If a Federation Council meeting to be addressed by [Russian 
Defense Minister] Grachev does take place tomorrow, and if the 
Federation Council supports President Yeltsin's edict on this 
issue, then an operation should start in the next few days, 
perhaps in two or three days. 
  The operation should have started on the 17th or 18th. 
Orders were issued and everything was ready for that. However, 
the heated debate and complications in our parliament became, to 
a certain extent, an obstacle for the timely start of this 
operation. At least, that is what I think. 
  The whole world will be a witness to this historic 
operation. 
I state without exaggerating that it will be a historic 
operation, carried out primarily by Russia, which will determine 
the future of Georgia and perhaps other countries as well. 
Judging by its form, content, and objectives and by the scope 
of the involvement of international organizations, I think that 
this operation will be an original and ingenious solution to the 
problem. 
  Since I briefly mentioned the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in 
my answer to your question, I would like to speak a little more 
about it. 
  The Georgian-Ossetian dialogue has resumed. Judging by this 
dialogue and by what has happened in the region in recent 
months, it can be said that we took the right decision as 
regards the introduction of peace-keeping forces to the region, 
which laid the foundation for a full-scale settlement. We took 
the right decision when we signed the Dagomys Agreement with 
President Yeltsin and the Ossetian side [on a tripartite 
peace-keeping operation in South Osetia]. 
  The agreement reached during the latest meeting attended by 
members of our office, Vazha Khachapuridze, who is a deputy, 
Nodar Lomauri, and others is a good start. Agreement was reached 
on such issues as the need to combine efforts to achieve 
stabilization in the entire region, to fight crime and drug 
trafficking, to restore business ties - you know how extensive 
these ties used to be - and to ensure the safety of travel, 
which is very important. Agreement was also reached to restore 
road and rail links with Tskhinvali and villages. This is 
necessary and very important. Some other issues were also 
agreed, which I believe is a good start. 
  Russia's mediation and active position is very useful for 
this dialogue. The Russian unit which is now stationed in 
Tskhinvali is playing a very active role in this. I would like 
to say a few warm words about Mr. Pavlov, or, rather, General 
Pavlov, who treats both sides' interests with much understanding 
and is doing many other good things. The active position of CSCE 
representatives is also very useful for this diologue, as is, of 
course, the role of the leadership of North Ossetia, which 
supports a fair and objective settlement of the conflict. There 
have been some positive developments in this area and think this 
process will become even more dynamic. 
  [Oniani] Georgia is a CIS member state, and we are all 
interested in how this new organization is going to develop. 
You have spoken more than once in your interviews about your 
vision of the future of the CIS. I would like to ask you how 
promising you think [Kazakh President] Nazarbayev's project is. 
  [Shevardnadze] First of all, I would like to say that I 
believe that the CIS as an international and interstate 
organization has ample resources for further development. As 
for Mr. Nazarbayev's proposals and his project, which he sent to 
me, I have examined it carefully and in detail. Some deputies 
who have never set their eyes on this project or its author 
vilified it in the parliament. Using such illegitimate methods 
to criticize important documents does their dignity no good. If 
the author agrees, I would like this document to be published in 
our country and elsewhere. 
  The Russian president said it was necessary to think about 
this initiative, which is understandable and right since the 
document deals with such complex and important issues that it is 
difficult to pass judgement on it after reading or looking 
through it only once. Its name does not represent a problem at 
all. The main thing is the essence. In my opinion, the essence 
of this document is that it creates more guarantees for the 
independence of states and calls for more integration among 
states. This applies to the economic and even military sphere 
and so on and so forth. It resembles the European Union model. 
[passage omitted] 
  I think that we should examine in a calm and businesslike 
manner any sensible idea concerning the future of new relations 
among states. I believe that Nazarbayev's proposal is one such 
interesting idea. 
  [Oniani] You had a meeting with bank representatives last 
week, where you spoke about the necessity for reorganization and 
reforms in the banking system. You have also mentioned that the 
Georgian economy is now entering a stage of reforms. Our 
country should become a country of bold experiments. Is the 
section of the population that we call businessmen ready for 
this? Or, how honest can Georgian business be? How much do you 
think it is involved in political processes? 
  [Shevardnadze] Georgian business is now at a shape-up stage. 
It requires help and assistance. That is why I spoke about a 
reform in banking. Although banking is considered a difficult 
area for launching experiments or entrepreneurship, I believe 
that banking-- the financial sphere generally and the economy on 
the whole--needs initiative, entrepreneurship, creative 
approaches, and experiments, if anything. 
  Georgia should gain a reputation as a country of bold 
experiments, and I am confident that foreign investors will take 
a much stronger interest in Georgia, provided we succeed in 
securing stability in the country and we are moving in this 
direction. 
  An edict I signed that opens a new stage of privatization in 
Georgia is also aimed at this reforms, at this task. I should 
tell you that I had been working on this edict for seven or 
eight months, back when there were seven or eight ideas on the 
subject in the Cabinet of Ministers. 
  Businessmen need protection most of all. First steps have 
been taken, and the country has entered a phase of a sort of 
stability. Now we are contemplating bringing order to the 
activities of controlling bodies. This is the most painful 
issue for Georgian business--bankers and businessmen. 
  I am for the earliest possible creation of proprietors 
within 
the population, and I do want more and more people to become 
proprietors. A proprietor's initiative, creative activity, 
and--I would say--a proprietor's vigor and persistence should 
save the country's economy. I am declaring with all 
responsibility that the state is the first to care about 
businessmen, about business with all its structures. We are 
pursuing this aim with consistency and on a large-scale and are 
considering our own mistakes as well as those of others. 
  In addition, I would like to raise the issue of law 
drafting. 
My address to the parliament was not incidental. A movement 
has already begun and work has also begun. The parliament has 
started to consider a very important draft law that was drafted 
and presented by [Justice Minister] Tedo Ninidze, together with 
others. This is a draft law on entrepreneurship. This will be 
a foundation for the development of entrepreneurship in Georgia. 
  The meeting with bankers has also revealed that we are in 
need of many laws, without which we will have no means to clear 
the obstacles for Georgian business. If passing of laws in the 
parliament is impeded, I will be forced to issue decrees on some 
of the topics. 
  [Oniani] Last week you were present at a military exercise 
in 
Batumi involving units of Russian troops stationed in the 
republic. You saw a lot of weapons there--for example, Grad 
installations and others, which just a few months ago were used 
to shell you and Georgian fighters in Sukhumi. Your next 
encounter with Russian weaponry took place in the serene 
atmosphere of a Batumi training ground. What happened in the 
meantime? Was it Shevardnadze who changed or, perhaps, the 
Russian military or, indeed, something else? 
  [Shevardnadze] Let us discuss who changed and who did not at 
a different time. Now I would like to say a few words about 
this joint exercise. This was indeed very important, and I 
returned from it very satisfied. Moreover, I saw that the two 
Batumi battalions that are to take part in the peace mission 
were ready to be deployed. 
  With regard to the exercise.... [pauses] We are now creating 
an army. We need an army today or tomorrow, not in the remote 
future. Under such circumstances, one should make use of 
something that is within their reach and something that is 
realistic. It is within our reach to cooperate with the Russian 
Armed Forces and, in doing this, to build a new army with their 
assistance. That is why I went to Batumi. Of course, there 
were other reasons for my visit as well--talking to Batoni Aslan 
[Abashidze, Supreme Council chairman and prime minister of 
Ajaria], sightseeing in Batumi, and so on. 
  I also urge other units to invite our young people who are 
already in the Army or are about to start service as often as 
possible. You know that the Russian Army has enormous 
experience, and--if we want to build an army soon--we should 
learn from this experience as quickly as possible. I will visit 
other units in the future. You know that Russian units are in 
Akhalkalaki and Vardzia. I am planning to visit these units too 
and to do everything to ensure that their condition of life and 
service are normal and that our people's attitude to them is 
normal and dignified. I want them to feel that they are living 
and serving in a friendly country. 
  At the same time, we should use this foundation to speed up 
the building of a single, mobile, and efficient army. I believe 
that this process is now starting to develop on a firm 
foundation. 
  I must also say that the newly-appointed minister [Defense 
Minister Varden Nadibaidze]--well, he is not that new any more 
and his colleagues are now working in a rather active manner to 
speed up the building of a single army. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, June 20, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart Laar 
on Sunday formally sent to President Lennart Meri his formal 
proposals to relieve Finance Minister Heiki Kranich and Culture 
and Education Minister Paul-Eerik Rummo from their duties, 
Government Spokesman Ain Saarna said. 
  According to the country's laws, the president now has got 
three days to make his decision. 
  Kranich and Rummo, both from the Liberal Democratic Party, 
entered their resignations last Tuesday. The Liberal Democratic 
Party on the same day announced its stepping out from the Pro 
Patria-led ruling coalition. 
  Recent media reports have mentioned Kalle Jurgenson, deputy 
chairman of the Pro Patria faction in the parliament, as a most 
likely candidate for the post of the finance minister, as well 
as Tonis Lukas, the director of the Estonian National Museum, as 
a possible new culture and education minister. Both have denied 
having received proposals to accept the positions. 
  Also mentioned have been Andres Lipstok, local 
administration 
leader in the western Laanemaa county, as possible new finance 
minister, and Tiit Sinissaar, head of the Pro Patria faction in 
the parliament, as minister of culture and education. 
  Estonia currently also has the position of the defense 
minister vacant. Official reports name Raul Opik as still the 
main candidate for the office. 
  The prime minister in interviews earlier has expressed hope 
that the new ministers will be sworn in at summer emergency 
sessions of the parliament, due at the end of this month.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius June 20 TASS -- Speaker of the Lithuanian 
parliament Ceslovas Jursenas called attempts by the right-wing 
party "Union of Fatherland" (Lithuanian Conservatives) to 
organise a referendum on economic issues as "efforts to 
undermine the state's foundations". 
  The party led by Vytautas Landsbergis and Giadiminos 
Vagnorius demands that the main item of the poll should be a 
100-time indexation of people's deposits at savings banks, the 
speaker said at a news conference on Monday which was broadcast 
by national radio. 
  He did not accept last Friday signatures of 413,110 
Lithuanians in support of a referendum, which were collected by 
a sponsoring group of conservatives. 
  Explaining reasons for his move, Jursenas said that "the old 
law is still in force. It lays down that such signatures should 
be handed over to the presidium of the Lithuanian parliament, an 
institution which is not provided for in the new constitution". 
  Besides, sheets with signatures, hence the will of people, 
were not formalised with the final act, as it is provided for by 
the previous law. Therefore, he had no powers from parliament 
to receive 43 volumes of signatures. 
  On the other hand, amendments to the law on referendum, 
which 
were adopted by parliament recently, were not approved by the 
Lithuanian president, which was well known to the sponsoring 
group. The legislature is to solve this "legal problem" on 
Tuesday. 
  Leader of Lithuanian Conservatives Vytautas Landsbergis who 
also held a news conference on Monday, described the speaker's 
actions as "a demonstration of disrespect for the will of nearly 
500,000 Lithuanian voters and a desire to win time".

  [Text] Kiev 21 June TASS -- A delegation of Israeli 
businessmen led by Minister for the Absorption of Immigrants 
Ya'ir Tzaban currently on a visit to Kiev split into several 
groups and held talks with representatives of Ukrainian 
ministries and departments on Monday [20 June]. 
  Ukrainian Vice-Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov met with one 
of 
the groups of the Israeli businessmen, led by President of the 
Federation of Israeli Commerce Chambers, Daniil Gillerman. The 
sides exchanged opinions on prospects for the development of 
Ukrainian-Israeli contacts. 
  Gillerman pointed out that the Israeli delegation numbers 
almost 100, which shows that the relations between the two 
countries have been intensively developing. The Israeli 
businessman said that Ukraine and Israel have good prospects for 
cooperation which should be realised. Ukraine might and will 
become Israel's priority partner, and the main trends and 
spheres of our cooperation should be determined as soon as 
possible. We hope that this goal will be reached during the 
current visit, Gillerman said.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Davydenko: "President Pleased with </F>
Partizan Agrifirm"] 
  [Text] Amur Oblast -- At his final press conference in 
Blagoveshchensk, Boris Yeltsin did not hide his disappointment 
at what he had seen in Amur Oblast: "I did not expect the 
oblast to have accumulated so many problems." 
  The president formed this impression after visiting the 
shipbuilding plant at Blagoveshchensk and the oblast "exhibition 
of achievements," dropping in unexpectedly at the first store en 
route, and holding two meetings with the leaders of the Amur 
region. 
  Boris Yeltsin also visited the village of Razdolnyy and the 
Partizan Agrifirm. In contrast, he was pleased with the latter 
visit. All the sectors in the firm are profitable. Last year 
each cow yielded almost one-quarter of a tonne of milk here, and 
12,000 tonnes of soybean and 15,000 tonnes of grain crops were 
harvested. The firm has energetically set about building shops 
to process its own produce. 
  But today's stable situation could have a downturn tomorrow, 
the workers were told by the president. Following the very good 
soybean harvest, it suddenly became apparent there was nowhere 
to store it. Plants in Irkutsk and Khabarovsk took 1 billion 
rublesworth of beans off the agrifirm, but have simply not paid 
for it. 
  Regarding the soybean in Amur's silos, Russian Vice Premier 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha, who was accompanying the president, said 
that it will very soon be taken into state stocks. The 
president advised them, however, to embark immediately on the 
construction of a plant in the oblast capable of processing 
300,000 tonnes of soybean per year. That is the priority task 
today, as problems with the sale of soybeans will recur every 
year. "Put all your efforts into constructing the plant, we 
will provide the money," Boris Yeltsin assured them. 
  The peasants complained that they had been unable to 
modernize their pool of combine harvesters for three years now. 
First, they don't have the money; second, the only plant in 
Russia producing tracked combine harvesters -- Dalselmash, in 
the city of Birobidzhan -- is at a standstill. 
  The president met the peasants of the Far East half-way 
here. 
While still in Blagoveshchensk, he gave the Finance Ministry the 
order to, as he put it, "unseal" Dalselmash, that is to say, 
provide it with finance. And another gift, this time a personal 
one, was bestowed by the president on Vladimir Byatets, 
Partizan's best combine harvester operator. Boris Yeltsin met 
with him and personally presented him with a Dalselmash tracked 
combine harvester....

  [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev intends to visit Brussels soon, he said in an 
interview today to a RIA correspondent. 
  During the visit the Russian minister expects to meet U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Kozyrev will discuss 
with the NATO leadership the questions of signing a NATO frame 
document for the Partnership for Peace and a Moscow-proposed 
programme of strategic cooperation between Russia and NATO. The 
latter document would determine the main documents of 
Russia-NATO cooperation with regard to the role and weight of 
Moscow in world affairs. 
  We believe, noted the Russian minister, that it is necessary 
to sign both documents simultaneously and will be ready to do it 
depending on how soon the entire required preparatory work will 
be completed in NATO headquarters. Kozyrev said that he could 
not give the precise date of his visit to Brussels since this 
question has to be agreed with all the parties concerned.

<F P=106> [by Akira Furumoto] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- On 15 June, Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov (former ambassador to South 
Korea), who is in charge of Russian policies toward the Korean 
peninsula, granted an interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN on the 
situation on the peninsula, which has become tense over the 
DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms development. During 
the interview, Panov stated that in recent phone talks (held on 
13 June), both the U.S. and Russian Presidents shared the view 
that the holding of an international conference of both North 
and South Korea, the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and 
others "could be the last chance" for riding out the current 
crisis. 
  His remarks indicate the Russian Government has great 
confidence in being able to realize the international meeting, 
amid the unusual situation in which North Korea announced 
withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Touching on the UN Security Council resolution expected to 
be 
adopted soon, Panov stated: "The holding of an international 
meeting and sanctions against the DPRK would be incorporated 
into the resolution as equal (options)." He also said both 
Presidents share the common view that "the implementation of 
sanctions are inevitable" if the international meeting does not 
take place due to North Korea's refusal or other reasons. 
  In considering North Korea's menacing remark in its 
statement 
of withdrawal from the IAEA that it will view the exercise of 
United Nations' sanctions "as a declaration of war," Panov 
stated: "The possibility cannot be ruled out" that North Korean 
special forces "will go into sporadic armed conflict and acts of 
provocation" against nations participating sanctions, including 
the United States, South Korea, as well as Japan. On the other 
hand, he indicated that North Korea does not have the capability 
to perform full-fledged advance operations to break through the 
well-defended demilitarized zone (DMZ), in view of the country's 
economic difficulties and the actual situation regarding its 
military equipment.

  [Text] Moscow, June 9, RIA -- The communist faction in the 
State Duma made a statement Wednesday in which it denounces the 
unilateral, in its opinion, position of the Russian leadership 
on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The statement 
says that certain quarters in the USA are trying to make North 
Korea accept the humiliating terms of settling this problem. 
The Russian communists express bewilderment that the Russian 
side is ready, though with reservations, to join the repressive 
measures with regard to North Korea. The authors of the 
statement believe that it is in the interests of Russia to 
"maintain balanced relations both with North and South Korea" 
and to create conditions for a dialogue between them. Communist 
MPs propose that a representative of the Foreign Ministry should 
report to the parliament about the Russian- South Korean talks 
that took place last week and about contacts with North Korea 
aimed at resolving the nuclear problem.

  [Text] Moscow, June 14, RIA -- There is a "unique chance" 
to attain a political settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a 
result of the Russian president's efforts, Russia's Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev told Radovan Karadzic, the leader of 
Bosnian Serbs, at their meeting in the Russian Foreign Ministry 
today. 
  Kozyrev said that in Geneva, there is every opportunity to 
settle the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina by political 
means. A second meeting of foreign ministers will be held soon 
to make a new step towards the settlement of the conflict, 
Kozyrev believes. 
  If Bosnian Serbs opt for peace, he stressed, they can count 
on Russia's decisive support. On the territorial issue, they 
would be able to count on getting 49 per cent of the territory, 
although this part is populated by approximately 30 per cent of 
the republic's overall population. They would be able to count 
on Moscow's support on the issues of lifting sanctions against 
the Union Republic of Yugoslavia, the country's return to the 
global community and the restoration of its war-ravished economy. 
  And then again, said Kozyrev, Bosnian Serbs may be 
stubbornly 
rejecting sensible compromises and holding onto the 70 per cent 
of the territory they have seized by force of arms, which will 
hardly help settle the conflict. The Russian foreign minister 
said he believed in Bosnian Serbs' common sense and hoped they 
would opt for peace. In case they do not choose peace, they 
would not be able to stake on Russia's support. 
  In his turn, Radovan Karadzic stressed that Serbs have 
highly 
valued Russia's support on all stages of the effort to attain a 
peaceful settlement in Bosnia. Serbs and Russians have 
maintained traditionally close ties of friendship for centuries. 
"What we want is an impartial approach to the issue of Bosnian 
settlement," Karadzic said. "We are tired of the many years of 
war and want peace in order to build a free, democratic society 
like Russia's," he noted.

  [Text] Paris, June 15, RIA -- [AGENCE] FRANCE PRESSE 
reported today, citing Western military sources and an anonymous 
representative of the Bosnian Army, two Russian mercenary 
pilots, employed by the Serbs, joined the Moslem Bosnian Army. 
They landed their Mi-17 helicopters at the headquarters of the 
3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army in Zenic, bringing along presents 
designed to show their good will, said a Bosnian officer. The 
two Russian pilots do not intend to take part in hostilities in 
Bosnia. It is the first case when Russians fighting on the side 
of the Serbs turned over to Moslems, the agency writes. The 
Russian Defence Ministry refused to comment.

  [Text] Moscow, June 11, RIA -- Russia and the United States 
favour "additional efforts" to settle the Bosnian crisis and 
support the idea of holding a UN-sponsored conference of the 
foreign ministers of all the parties involved in the conflict, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told a RIA correspondent 
upon his return from a NATO meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. 
  Mr. Kozyrev said he discussed the matter with US Secretary 
of 
State Warren Christopher and the two men made public their 
decision at a joint press conference. 
  Mr. Kozyrev said that a second round of Geneva talks could 
give a fresh impetus to the political settlement process and 
noted that he and his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd, agreed 
that the meeting in Geneva should be held before the G-7 meeting 
in Naples. 
  Next week the liaison group on the mapping of Bosnia will 
hold a new meeting, Mr. Kozyrev reported, adding that the sides 
should work out a common position on the issue as soon as 
possible.

  [Text] Moscow, June 5, RIA -- The main parties to the 
Bosnian conflict should step over their differences and realise 
the need for the resumption of the Geneva cease-fire talks, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said in an exclusive 
interview with a RIA correspondent. Churkin is just back from 
Geneva where a meeting between the leaders of the warring 
parties and the main intermediaries in the Bosnian settlement 
was to be held. 
  The attempt to resume the cease-fire talks has failed 
because 
of the stance of the Bosnian Moslem leaders. The latter claim 
that the Serbs have not fulfilled their obligations with regard 
to Gorazde. Moslems demand the withdrawal of Serbian troops from 
Gorazde. 
  "On Saturday [4 June], Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the 
UN secretary-general, arrived at the conclusion that the Serbs 
have fulfilled all the conditions with regard to Gorazde. The 
Moslem leaders, however, decided that this was not enough to 
resume the talks," Churkin said. He said that he was sorry that 
the Bosnian Moslem leaders assumed such a position on the 
resumption of the Geneva talks. It is so important to ensure a 
reliable ceasefire that the parties drawn into the Bosnian 
conflict should revise their own positions in the name of the 
resumption of the talks, he went on.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will not suspend his decree on fighting gangsterism in 
Russia, presidential chief of staff Sergey Filatov said on 
Monday. 
  Filatov told ITAR-TASS that despite the State Duma's 
recommendation to suspend the decree on urgent measures to 
protect the population from gangsterism, "Boris Yeltsin has no 
intention to backtrack from his decision." 
  Commenting on the president's aides' position, Filatov said 
that "for two years there have been the talks about the need to 
fight crime, but anti-crime legislation has not moved a step 
forward." The last few years have been marked by the thriving of 
such dangerous forms of crime as terrorism and gangsterism. 
Criminal gangs have brought society to the verge of war. 
People are losing confidence and faith that bodies of power can 
protect them, he said. 
  Filatov believes that the decree is very timely. 
  Explaining why the president allowed the police to detain 
suspects for 30 instead of three days as envisaged by the 
current criminal code, Filatov said that not less than 50 per 
cent of crimes are committed by outside hoods. But 72 hours are 
not enough to find evidence and trace criminal groupings. 
Criminals go abroad and avoid the inevitability of punishment. 
A 30-day detention will allow (the police) to bring the 
majority of criminal cases to court. 
  At the same time, Filatov did not hide his concern that the 
implementation of the decree may cause human rights abuses. To 
minimise the possible negative impact of the decree, Filatov 
suggested strengthening the role of the public prosecutor's 
office, the Russian High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
Russian Presidential Commission for Human Rights. 
  Filatov said that the leaders of Russian regions have 
supported Yeltsin's measures to fight organised crime.

  [Text] The critics of the Russian president's decree on 
combating crime view some of its provisions abstractly, apart 
from the goals pursued by the document, the first deputy chief 
of the Interior Ministry's department for combating organized 
crime, Gennadiy Chebotarev, told Interfax. 
  For instance, the provision concerning the lifting of such 
obstacles, as banking or commercial secrets, will be applied 
only toward criminal groups, said Chebotarev. "The decree does 
not stipulate that from now on there will be no banking or 
commercial secrets at all," he noted. 
  According to Chebotarev, "false advice notes whose worth 
exceeds one billion dollars continue to circulate in the 
country." "Over two thousand such notes were issued in Dagestan 
alone; about 700 figure-head firms led by nonexistent people 
were established there," he said. "Such machinations must be 
stopped promptly, and provisions of the presidential decree will 
be used in precisely that direction." 
  The decree might contribute to enhancing the endeavors to 
protect the population in real terms, Chebotarev said. "Measures 
designed to combat crime, in particular inspections of cars, 
will inconvenience people, but such actions are necessary, since 
a vast stream of weapons flows into Russia from abroad," he said. 
  "Arms from Estonia, from Tajikistan, from the North Caucasus 
and from Trans-Caucasus are spreading across the country, and in 
these conditions such simple measures of precaution, as 
inspections of cars and trucks, present nothing new," Chebotarev 
pointed out. 
  He dismissed the possibility that, granted the opportunity 
to 
detain those suspected of having committed crimes for 30 days, 
the police will abuse its power. "The decree stipulates that 
for the prosecuting authorities to get involved: sufficient 
evidence proving the given person's involvement in organized 
crime will have to be submitted to the prosecutors in order to 
get their warrant," Chebotarev said. 
  To carry out the decree the law-enforcement agencies will 
analyse the data concerning gangs acting in Russia and take 
steps to expose them. "At present we are aware of more than 
5,000 criminal groups acting throughout Russia," Chebotarev said. 
  "They have the opportunity to give up their criminal 
activity, of course, and I think that the preventive importance 
of the decree is also great," Interfax's interviewee said.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's edict on fighting banditry and 
organized crime is accumulating an ever larger number of 
opinions. Former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy, the famous 
champion of the fight against corruption, has not remained on 
the sidelines. Presently in Krasnoyarsk, Rutskoy, chairman of 
the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, has criticized 
this edict. One of his arguments is: Name me a single document 
which could be implemented, Rutskoy said in an interview to a 
RIA correspondent. Rutskoy believes that the edict has not been 
thoroughly worked out, and not only violates human rights, but 
is contradictory to legislation. With the aid of the edict, the 
authorities intend to drive society into a condition of total 
pathological fear, Rutskoy said.

<F P=106> ["NG" report under the "Repercussion" rubric: "Yeltsin's </F>
Edict Excites Emotions. `Memorial' and Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Make Statements"] 
  [Text] In its statement, the "Memorial" human rights 
center believes that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's signing 
of an edict "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population From 
Banditry and Other Forms of Organized Crime" puts in serious 
doubt the possibility of building a law-governed state in Russia. 
  "Facing a serious threat to society and the state emanating 
from the rising tide of crime, the president and the executive 
branch have decided to sacrifice the principles of Law and 
Democracy," the document underlines. "At the same time, the 
Constitution, to whose letter and spirit the authorities only 
recently vowed to be true, is being violated in the crudest way. 
Also being ignored are international treaties and federal laws, 
in particular the Russian Federation Criminal Process Code. The 
authors of the edict have acknowledged their impotence to cope 
with crime within the limits of the law. The authorities in 
every country are tempted to achieve stability and order by 
using dictatorial and law-contravening methods. We do know from 
history that totalitarian regimes -- Soviet Russia, fascist 
Italy -- coped with crime. But at what price?" 
  In the meantime, the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs [RUIE] states that "in its scale, cynicism, and 
impunity the terror thrust on society by criminal groups is 
gradually turning from an essentially criminal factor into a 
factor containing a real threat to the social foundations and 
state security. 
  "There should be a clear realization of the fact that the 
situation is already slipping out of control; hence it calls for 
extraordinary measures. Otherwise, there will be a criminal 
degradation of society. The should be not so much good 
intentions as energetic, uncompromising actions to eradicate 
crime that has gotten out of control." 
  The RUIE statement underscores that industrialists and 
entrepreneurs of Russia are prepared to support any resolute 
steps by the president, the Federal Assembly, and the government 
to impose law and order and to provide guarantees of personal 
security for the people of Russia.

<F P=106> [Statement by Russian Union of Industrialists and </F>
Entrepreneurs: "Who Will Be Next?"] 
  [Text] Acts of armed violence against Russian 
industrialists and entrepreneurs are continuing in Moscow and 
other Russian cities. In terms of its scale, cynicism, and 
impunity the terror imposed on society by criminal groupings is 
gradually turning from a strictly criminal factor into a factor 
which poses a real threat to social foundations and citizens' 
safety. Committing murders, explosions, acts of arson, and 
other crimes and remaining, for the most part, invulnerable to 
criminal prosecution, criminal elements are destroying the 
people's moral health and giving rise to fear and lack of faith 
in the authorities' ability to ensure citizens' safety. 
  Literally every day augments the tragic list of people who 
have died at the hands of hired killers and bandits. Boris 
Berezovskiy, general director of the "All-Russia Automobile 
Alliance," might have become their latest victim. An attempt 
was made on his life in downtown Moscow 7 June. Fate proved 
charitable to him, but his companion died, and several people 
who happened to be at the scene of the explosion received 
injuries and mutilations of varying gravity. Who will be 
next?... 
  It must be clearly understood that the situation is already 
getting out of control and, thus, requires extraordinary 
measures to be taken. Otherwise the criminal degradation of the 
state will occur. What is needed is not so much good intentions 
as vigorous, uncompromising action to eradicate the criminal 
free-for-all. 
  For their part Russia's industrialists and entrepreneurs are 
prepared to support any resolute steps by the president, the 
Federal Assembly, and the government to instill law and order 
and to ensure guarantees of Russians' personal safety. 
  The Association of Russian Banks has issued a similar 
statement. 
  [Signed] The Board of the Russian Union of Industrialists 
and Entrepreneurs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "By All Possible Means?"] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Federation Government Council for 
Industry and Enterprise is prepared to participate most 
actively, by all possible means, and in every possible way in 
curbing the orgy of crime. A statement by the Council says that 
"the country has entered a phase of political terror of 
unprecedented dimensions. A State Duma deputy, a banker, and an 
entrepreneur have been among the victims. The people involved 
in the revival of Russia are dying." 
  People's constitutional right to safety must finally become 
a 
state, rather than just a private problem, the document notes. 
Defective legislation, which more often than not protects the 
criminal rather than the citizen, the impotence of the 
law-enforcement organs, and official inaction are merely giving 
the criminal world a free hand. Society is entitled to demand 
that the state power structures place an insuperable barrier in 
the way of the criminals rampaging in the country and placing 
basic democratic values in peril. 
  "Terrorist actions are carefully thought out and organized 
and have a very specific aim: To give criminal elements a clear 
run at the levers of political power," a statement by the 
Association of Russian Banks says. 
  The document notes that the association is prepared to give 
every assistance to the law-enforcement organs and other state 
structures in the fight against crime. 
  The Russian Party of Free Labor, in turn, believes that the 
edict on protecting the population against bandits "contains no 
visible means of making law-abiding property-owners safe from 
bandit attacks. But militia officers have been given a free 
hand in the area of constitutional guarantees of the protection 
of citizens' private lives -- an area they have been interested 
in for a long time." The Russian Party of Free Labor urged "the 
president and the State Duma to instruct independent experts to 
finalize proposals on combating organized crime, keeping them 
reasonable and, at the same time, bringing them into line with 
the Constitution."

<F P=106> ["Parliamentary Diary" by Vladimir Isakov: "1937 Again?"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Law of Revolution [subhead] 
  The gloomy forecast that "insignificant deviations from the 
law" and "individual violations of the Constitution" will sooner 
or later lead to repressions against people is beginning to come 
true even early than expected. The president's 14 June 1994 
edict no. 1226 "on urgent measures to protect the population 
from banditry and other manifestations of organized crime" opens 
up a tragic new page in Russian history in that sense. 
  The edict stipulates in particular that when there is 
"sufficient information" (who will determine this?) that a 
person belongs to a gang or other organized group, "by agreement 
with the prosecutor" (but without sanction) before criminal 
proceedings are instituted reviews and other investigatory 
actions can be undertaken with regard to the suspects, their 
relations, acquaintances, corporate bodies, and PUBLIC 
ASSOCIATIONS. 
  An undertaking not to change address, personal surety, 
surety 
from public organizations, and bail are not applied with regard 
those suspects and accused of these crimes, they can be arrested 
without charge for a period of up to 30 days. 
  Representatives of the internal affairs and 
counterintelligence organs have received the right to search at 
any time the premises of enterprises, organizations, and 
institutions and also transport facilities and their drivers and 
passengers and on any pretext and not only in connection with 
suspicion of having committed a crime. 
  At first glance there is nothing frightening in the edict -- 
no prison, camps, or firing squad. But we should have no 
illusions: The edict is a heavy brick thrown in the window of 
legality and human rights. The window has been smashed to 
smithereens and it will not be long before the firing squad.... 
  I shall not tiresomely enumerate the articles of the 
Constitution, Criminal Code, and Criminal Procedure Code 
violated by the president's edict -- the lawlessness lies 
"heavily, crudely, and visibly" on the surface and no one is 
trying to hide it. Something else is more important: The edict 
DOES NOT HAVE A LEGAL MECHANISM OF IMPLEMENTATION. Any lawyer 
will tell you that in a situation where he has to choose between 
a law and an edict, a judge, prosecutor, or investigator must 
unfailingly FOLLOW THE LAW -- he is obliged to do so by his 
duty, by the law, and by the Constitution which, incidentally, 
no one has formally repealed. 
  The president's edict gives a wonderful opportunity for 
playing cat and mouse with jurisprudence and speculating on the 
fact that "the evidence has been obtained by illegal means" and 
that the suspect is "the victim of tyranny and illegal 
repressions." This "loophole" will be used unfailingly by those 
against whom the edict is allegedly aimed -- inveterate, well 
prepared criminal elements with the opportunity for hiring a 
reliable attorney. In proclaiming the intensification of the 
struggle against crime the edict in fact weakens and 
disorganizes it. It is that which puts us on our guard: Why 
then was it published? 
  I venture to suggest that in fact the edict has nothing to 
do 
with the struggle against crime, it is pursuing completely 
different -- political -- aims. 
  First: dragging the Duma into a confrontation with the 
president. 
  To someone who has lived through the defeat of the Supreme 
Soviet it is as clear as daylight. In just the same way a year 
ago the Supreme Soviet was drawn into confrontation by lawless 
edicts on privatization and was taunted with "decoy ducks" in 
the budget. And they achieved their end -- first the Supreme 
Soviet was discredited and then it was destroyed completely. A 
year later we can see that the Supreme Soviet was right in many 
waYS: The budget collapsed, privatization has discredited 
itself, but who remembers that the Supreme Soviet was right? 
  For several months now a similar game has been under way 
against the State Duma. The first round was the amnesty 
(initiated by the president let me remind you) which 
ended in the Duma's favor. The deputies were not split and did 
not quarrel -- on the contrary, they adopted a decision which 
eased the pitch of political confrontation in society and 
compelled the president to invent the "social accord treaty" to 
capture the political initiative.... 
  The second round -- the budget round -- is ending in a draw. 
Yes, it is the case that the Duma did not gain any political 
dividends from the budget but there are no grounds for 
discrediting it -- it simply took and without lengthy 
discussions approved the budget submitted by the government. If 
there is something wrong then it is all the complaints against 
the government and president. 
  Next in line is the third and probably last round. Having 
violated the Constitution and the laws and cancelled out draft 
laws on the struggle against crime on which the Duma is working, 
the president has issued an edict which most grossly flouts 
human and civil rights. The aim is to provoke an outburst of 
anger among the deputies and the public and perhaps to retreat 
and then to put all the blame on the deputies for the collapse 
of the economy and the catastrophic increase in crime. A well 
known, cliched, and base trick which has been used many times: 
"The worse, the better, we shall find the culprits!" 
  The second reason: To remove the "taboo" on the criminal and 
criminal procedure codes and to accustom people to the idea that 
they can be replaced by the president's edicts. To force 
workers in the law enforcement organs to transgress the oath 
which obliges them to serve the people and to obey the laws. 
  How exactly do the organs protecting law and order differ 
from any armed gang? The use of violence? Both use violence. 
Technical equipping? The mafiosi and racketeers have perhaps a 
higher degree of technical equipment. There is one difference 
and it is the main one: the attitude toward the law. According 
to this indicator it has always been believed that they are on 
different sides of the barricades. The president's edict erodes 
that difference. Law enforcement organs which do not base their 
activity on the law are transformed from a tool in the struggle 
against crime into the largest mafioso gang backing up the power 
and interests of their "godfather." 
  I would not be surprised if with time it emerges that the 
series of murders and acts of terrorism which swept the capital 
immediately after the edict was adopted were a "special order" 
from some high-ranking gentleman. After all it is so important 
that photographs of bloodstained, lacerated bodies should appear 
in newspapers and television reports next to items from the 
State Duma "which is preventing the president from struggling 
against crime." So why not push someone toward vigorous actions? 
We are used to the acts of provocation of our sovereigns and 
the moral standard of all the present authorities leaves us with 
no illusions. 
  The third reason is the need for preemptive measures before 
the fall which promises to be "hot." Despite all the assurances 
and promises, the catastrophic decline in industry has not been 
overcome and stoppages of enterprises continue. Readiness for 
bringing in the harvest is 50 percent even compared with last 
year, which was far from a record-breaking one. However patient 
the Russian peasant is, betrayed and slandered by everyone, cut 
down by market "reforms," even his patience will finally 
break.... And it is here that the president's "storm 
detachments" will be needed, detachments which do not consider 
any laws. 
  Nonetheless the edict is having no "triumphal progress." Of 
famous political leaders only two -- Zhirinovskiy and Travkin -- 
have openly supported it. The former because the edict fully 
complies with his own ideas of the struggle against crime (that 
is how he intends to act when he comes to power) and the latter 
most likely because he is burdened with the portfolios of a 
"minister without portfolio" in the present government cabinet. 
  The edict has met with a sharply negative response even 
from pro-president groups of deputies and many lawyers, and 
former human rights champions who understand very well what kind 
of a hopeless quagmire the country can be led into by the 
president's "experiments" with the criminal code. Having sensed 
a smell of burning the "democratic press" has started to scurry 
about and become perturbed.... And it has reason: The first to 
come under the axe of illegal repressions are opponents, next 
are unreliable supporters, and then all the rest, without number 
and indiscriminately. After all, that is the "law of 
revolution...."

<F P=106> [Andrey Kobich report: "Meeting at Journalists House. </F>
Journalists Are Going To Combat Crime Their Own Way"] 
  [Text] The participants in yesterday's press conference at 
the Central Journalists House were Eduard Sagalayev, head of the 
TV-6 network; Artem Borovik, chief editor of the newspaper 
SOVERSHENNO SEKRETNO; Aleksandr Mitroshenkov, director of public 
relations for the "LogoVAZ" joint-stock company; and Nikolay 
Koptev, deputy chief of the Regional Directorate on Organized 
Crime of the Moscow Internal Affairs Main Administration. 
Participants in the press conference proposed that journalist 
collectives stage an action of protest against rampant crime in 
the country. 
  In the view of Mr. Borovik, it is impossible today to combat 
crime effectively because the "executive positions in the 
economy and politics are under mafia control." Gangster 
formations also put pressure to bear on the mass media. Mr. 
Borovik has already been in two "deliberate road accidents." In 
order to draw the authorities' attention to the problem of 
crime, he suggested that all newspapers simultaneously carry on 
their front pages early in July stories about crimes committed 
by gangster groups. Some other suggestions were voiced at the 
press conference. For example, all publications should leave 
blank spaces reserved for stories of crimes. The blank spaces 
in newspapers would symbolize the state of crime in the country. 
Besides it was proposed to declare as of 1 July a year of the 
mass media combat against organized crime. 
  Mr. Mitroshenkov, director of public relations for the 
"LogoVAZ" joint-stock company, pointed out that the attempt on 
the life of Boris Berezovskiy, general director of the "LogoVAZ" 
joint-stock company and chairman of the AVVA board of directors, 
can be seen "as an encroachment on the interests of millions of 
depositors of these companies." In Mr. Mitroshenkov's words, 
"LogoVAZ" and AVVA are trying to stabilize prices in the Russian 
auto market. Some people did not like this, he thinks, and as a 
result the attempt on Berezovskiy's life was organized. He 
stated, however, that "LogoVAZ" and AVVA will keep trying to 
create a civilized auto market in Russia. Mr. Mitroshenko 
advised that the attempt on the life of the "LogoVAZ" general 
director could have resulted in a much greater number of victims 
because there were more than 100 people at the streetcar stop a 
short way from where the bomb exploded. They were unhurt by 
pure chance: The streetcar pulled up minutes before the blast. 
Mr. Mitroshenko voiced dissatisfaction with the fact that the 
investigation did not come up with any results two weeks after 
the attempt on Berezovskiy's life. 
  Nikolay Koptev, deputy chief of the Regional Directorate on 
Organized Crime, told the journalists that a four- or five-fold 
growth in the crime rate has been recorded this year. He 
suggested, however, that the situation should not be dramatized: 
In his words, the mafia does not rule the country, while the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs has the power to cope with crime. 
Provided of course that laws on combating corruption and 
organized crime are passed soon. Mr. Koptev did not recommend to 
journalists that they go ahead with the protest action and asked 
that, rather, they should simply objectively cover the work of 
militia.

  [Text] In 1993, citizens of former Soviet republics 
committed more than 15,000 crimes in Russia, compared to 530 in 
1992, Head of the Central Criminal Investigation Department 
Lieutenant-General Vladimir Kolesnikov said during a briefing on 
Tuesday. 
  Kolesnikov said that the number of crimes committed by 
citizens of countries other than the former Soviet republics had 
also increased more than 4 times. Many foreigners have fallen 
victim to crime. 
  About 20 percent of the crimes are committed against 
foreigners who come to Russia on business, 20 per cent against 
foreign tourists and 13 percent against foreign visitors who 
arrive in Russia on private invitations. 
  In 1993, 311 crimes were committed against Finnish citizens, 
304 against Germans and 109 against British citizens. In 1994, 
more than 4,500 crimes were committed against foreign citizens. 
  Kolesnikov announced that the Interior Ministry had drafted 
new rules for foreign citizens' stay in Russia, and a law on 
foreign citizens. Both documents are being considered by the 
State Duma.

  [Text] Leader of the Russian communist party Gennady 
Zyuganov believes that the country is on the threshold of 
criminal dictatorship. On Saturday he addressed the sitting of 
the forum Towards New Accord in Moscow. Representatives of 17 
parties and 30 public organizations and movements from former 
Soviet republics except Turkmenistan participated in the sitting. 
  According to Zyuganov, "dictatorship is inevitable" in the 
case that "neither replacement of the course, nor refusal from 
political revenge, nor formation of a government of national 
confidence take place in the near term and priority trends in 
the development of the agrarian industrial complex, military 
industrial complex, education, science, and culture are not 
determined." 
  The sitting discussed problems and prospects of economic and 
political unification of the former Soviet republics. As said 
President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy, it would be necessary to Moscow 
to invest 10,000 trillion rubles in order "to transfer to 
self-subsistence economy" that is to manage without economic 
cooperation with the former Soviet republics. 
  The volume of the inter-republican trade was 21 percent of 
the USSR GNP, reported former USSR premier Nikolay Ryzhkov. At 
the same time he said that out of 15 Soviet republics only 
Russia and Turkmenistan had favorable trade balance. "Beginning 
with 1917 Russia always gave more than it received," Ryzhkov 
declared. 
  He warned about the danger "of ignoring and silencing" of 
the 
issue on the borders within the former Soviet Union and reported 
there were 70 points on its territory "which can trigger the 
issue on the borders." 
  In Ryzhkov's opinion, "the CIS appeared to be lacking vital 
capacity and has not justified its tasks." A future voluntary 
union, he said, should be open not only for former Soviet 
republics but for other countries of Europe and Asia which will 
express their wish to join it.

  [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- President Yeltsin visited 
today a special crack police division of the Interior Ministry 
troops (the former Dzerzhinskiy Division). 
  On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the creation of 
the division, the commander-in-chief viewed the parade of the 
division's personnel and the performance of the special task 
force. The president was invited to have lunch at the soldiers' 
canteen and had a conversation with servicemen. 
  He was accompanied by Interior Minister Viktor Yerin and 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  The history of the division is inseparably connected with 
the 
history of Russia and Moscow, its capital. Several generations 
of officers and men, serving in the division, fulfilled their 
duty with dignity. Nineteen of them were awarded the titles of 
the hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation, 
thousands were awarded orders and medals. 
  Yeltsin sent today a congratulatory message to soldiers, 
sergeants, non-commissioned officers, officers and veterans of 
the division. 
  "By successfully carrying out your tasks, especially during 
the troublesome recent years, you contributed a great deal to 
the preservation of civil peace in the country. I am confident 
that you will continue to ensure public security, acting jointly 
with other branches of the Interior Ministry, in the interests 
of the consolidation of the Russian state," the message said.

<F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova: "Public Chamber Wants To </F>
Influence the President's Decisions. It Is Charged With 
`Overseeing' the Treaty on Accord"] 
  [Text] There are already 863 signatures on the Treaty on 
Social Accord. Social organizations and parties account for 265 
of these, entrepreneurial, commercial, and banking structures 
for 285. Fifty-two trade unions, 65 scientific organizations, 
17 mass media sources, 10 creeds, six parliamentary factions, 
and others, have signed. These figures were cited at a routine 
session of the Russian Federation President's Public Chamber 18 
June by Sergey Filatov, leader of the Presidential Staff, who 
was recently appointed leader of the conciliation commission 
implementing the treaty. Sergey Filatov said that, first, the 
agreement on civil peace is still open for people to join and, 
second, work on signing it is being stepped up in the regions. 
The operation of the treaty itself is already becoming 
apparent, in the Presidential Staff leader's opinion: At any 
rate, even the intransigent opposition has been forced to take 
account of public opinion and change tactics, giving its 
"protest actions" a more respectable look. 
  Since the signing of the treaty is only the first stage of 
the journey down the road of civil peace, a conciliation 
commission is being formed to implement it; it includes 
representatives of all the branches of power. Independent 
experts will be involved in its work. Both cochairman from the 
Public Chamber (A. Sobchak and B. Topornin) will sit on the 
commission, as will the leaders of five newly created 
commissions: for political stability; for socioeconomic 
problems; for questions of federative structure and national 
relations; for security; and for problems of science, education, 
and culture. According to the president's idea, these Public 
Chamber commissions are necessary to analyze progress in 
fulfilling the Treaty on Social Accord and to elaborate 
recommendations for its implementation. 
  Despite the optimism with which Sergey Filatov and Vice 
Premier Aleksandr Shokhin tried to infect members of the Public 
Chamber, many of the sociopolitical movement leaders present in 
the Kremlin expressed doubt as to the Public Chamber's prestige 
and political weight. The sufficiently trenchant but 
constructive criticism expressed in particular with regard to 
the president's edict on fighting organized crime also suggests 
that the Public Chamber does not wish to be a eulogistic chorus 
of "courtiers." If the chamber wants to be a truly prestigious 
body, one participant said, it should not only criticize the 
president's unsuccessful steps but also have the possibility of 
averting them.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The chief of the presidential staff Sergey Filatov 
believes that no serious risk is in sight of the Russian 
Federation falling apart. Filatov told the public chamber at 
the office of the President in the Kremlin on Saturday the 
diminishing threat of a break-up of the Russian Federation was a 
direct result of the treaty of social accord (Filatov is 
chairman of the conciliatory commission to effect that document 
-- INTERFAX). 
  "So far 863 political parties, non-governmental 
organizations 
and associations have signed that treaty and the 
signature-raising campaign will go on", Filatov said. 
  He pointed to what he described as society's "ever more 
neutral, in some cases negative attitude" to the opposition's 
attempts to resist reform. He said that under the influence of 
that treaty the opposition had shifted to "more civilized forms 
of confrontation". 
  Filatov admitted that the social price of reform was very 
high: "The gap between wealth and poverty is keenly felt by 
society and crime and corruption rates are alarming." The chief 
of the presidential staff described the latest package of 
President Yeltsin's decrees on economic issues as an "instrument 
of the fairest distribution of problems in society during the 
transition phase". 
  Filatov believes that resolving problems of the transitional 
period would be possible only in the climate of civic accord. 
He said society needed stable rules of political struggle. At 
the same time he said that the executive authorities were 
prepared for a dialogue with any political forces, provided they 
observed the Constitution of the Russian Federation. 
  Filatov said that attempts to recreate the USSR by force 
might trigger a civil war. He said those who sought to revise 
the Belovezh agreements and restore the USSR by force must 
remember that they gamble with the lives of millions. "Attempts 
to act on such ideas is the surest way to civil war comparable 
in scale only to World War II". 
  Alongside other favorable changes resulting from the treaty 
of social accord Filatov pointed to "other republics' growing 
confidence in Russia". President Yeltsin's chief of staff 
admitted that part of society was "ostalgic about real socialism 
and sweet deceit and self-deceit". 
  Filatov said Russia's reformist and democratic forces had 
approached a dramatic frontier, where new ideas had to be 
formulated and strategy adjusted. 
  The presidential chief of staff described the crime 
situation 
in Russia as "close to an emergency". He said that was the main 
reason that prompted President Yeltsin to sign the decree to 
protect the population from gangsterism and organized crime. 
"Ten explosions a day is a sure sign that criminal gangs impose 
their mode of life and ideology on society", Filatov told 
INTERFAX. 
  Filatov believes that the main reason why society disagrees 
with the presidential decree is that it permits detaining 
suspects for 30 days. He said that that measure was "borrowed 
from the state of emergency law". Filatov believes that those 
who argue this provision of the decree should be compensated in 
legal terms, "by eliminating people's old-time fear of the 
sweeping powers of policing agencies" are right, too. The chief 
of presidential staff believes that that can be achieved with 
assistance from the conciliatory commission for effecting the 
treaty of social accord. 
  The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament 
Ivan 
Rybkin believes that the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures 
to Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other 
Manifestations of Organized Crime" is a necessary measure. At 
the same time he told journalists that in order to avoid 
"frictions between the president and the Duma" Boris Yeltsin 
should have presented in advance an appropriate bill of 
amendments to the criminal code. 
  The State Duma last Friday included debates on the 
presidential decree in its agenda, however, failed to begin it 
due to the shortage of time. The State Duma's Security 
Committee drafted a resolution entitled "On the Protection of 
Constitutional Rights and Freedoms of Citizens While 
Implementing Measures to Fight Against Crime" asked the 
president to suspend the decree, because it ran counter to the 
Constitution and the criminal code [sentence as received]. The 
attention of the Supreme Court was drawn to the need to stick to 
the current legislation in administering justice.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 ITAR-TASS -- More than one-third of 
Russians polled in a recent survey by the Public Opinion Fund 
said it is in the interests of the country to reunify Russia 
with other former Soviet republics in one state. But one-fourth 
of the respondents in the poll said they were against any 
reunification with any country. 
  Asked what countries should be given preference in the 
unification process, three percent favored Azerbaijan, four 
percent Armenia, 24 percent Belarus, four percent Georgia, 13 
percent Kazakhstan, three percent Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan], four 
percent Latvia, three percent Lithuania, eight percent Moldavia, 
four percent Tajikistan, three percent Turkmenia, four percent 
Uzbekistan, 24 per cent Ukraine and three percent Estonia. 
  Thirty-four percent called for reunification with all former 
Soviet republics. 
  Only 13 percent of those polled were uncertain. 
  The poll of 1200 respondents was conducted in June, and its 
results were published in the BUSINESS WORLD WEEKLY on Tuesday.

  [Text] The Federation Council and Duma are to receive from 
President Yeltsin Tuesday or Wednesday a bill on the Prosecutor 
General's Office. The Council's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko 
announced in the parliament's upper house on Tuesday that 
Yeltsin will submit the document as part of his legislative 
initiative. 
  Shumeyko explained that Yeltsin is offering lawmakers the 
opportunity to first discuss the role of the Prosecutor 
General's Office and only "then choose a person to run it." 
  So far Aleksey Ilyushenko has been acting as Prosecutor 
General, despite the fact that he has proved unpopular in the 
Federation Council. 
  After Shumeyko's statement, the issue of making the proposal 
on a Prosecutor General part of the session's agenda was put to 
a vote at several legislators insistence. However, it was not 
included in the agenda because the motion did not collect the 
necessary number of votes.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- If the presidential election 
was to be held in Russia today, the two main contenders for the 
top post would be current president Boris Yeltsin and 
democrat-reformer Grigoriy Yavlinskiy. At least, such a 
conclusion is indicated by the results of a survey conducted by 
the independent polling company "Mnenie" (Opinion) among a 
representative sample of four thousand people in 30 Russian 
districts. 
  However, there is a large danger that the presidential 
elections, if held today, would not be valid or would be an only 
partly meaningful political exercise. Of those questioned, 38 
percent said they did not trust any of the likely candidates, 
and 18 percent are already planning to skip the elections 
altogether. 
  Yeltsin proved that he is still considered the lesser of all 
the evils, receiving 11.3 percent of the hypothetical votes. In 
second place was Yavlinskiy, leader of the "Yabloko" electoral 
bloc, with nine percent. 
  Yeltsin received proportionately more support among citizens 
over thirty years of age. The 18-29 age group pinned their 
hopes for Russia's future more on the leader of the Yabloko 
bloc, who received 9.5 percent of their votes, compared to 
Yeltsin's 7.4 percent. 
  Yavlinskiy also appealed to the middle and upper classes. 
13.7 percent of those with monthly salaries of 100,000 rubles 
or more (50 U.S. dollars) supported Yavlinskiy, while 11.5 
percent preferred Yeltsin. The president's support among 
respondents with 50,000 or less rubles a month was 10.2 percent. 
  Ex-vice-president and opposition leader Aleksandr Rutskoy 
gets most of his support from the countryside and small towns 
(seven percent each), although Yeltsin had higher figures among 
both types of rural dwellers. Extreme-nationalist Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy did not get into the top three slots except among 
country people, who gave him third place behind Yeltsin and 
Rutskoy.

  "I congratulate soldiers, sergeants, non-commissioned 
officers, officers and veterans of the special task force 
division of the Russian Interior Ministry troops on the occasion 
of the 70th anniversary of its creation. 
  "The history of your division is inseparably connected with

  "The successful fulfilment of official duties and combat 
tasks, especially during the troublesome past several years, 
contributed a great deal to maintaining civic peace in the 
country. I am confident that you will continue to ensure public 
security together with all the branches of the Interior Ministry 
in the interests of the consolidation of the Russian state. 
  "I rely on your will, honour and courage. Maintain and

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin has 
sent a message of greetings to participants in an 
interconfessional conference, which opened here on Tuesday, on 
the subject "The Christian Faith and Human Animosity". 
  Greeting the spiritual leaders of most of Christian churches 
and religious associations that traditionally exist in CIS and 
Baltic countries, the president pointed out that their 
"aspiration to find ways for the Christians' full-scale 
participation in overcoming human animosity in the post-Soviet 
space" is close and understandable to him. 
  "Over long years of militant atheism, the souls of many 
people have become depleted and have grown hard, harbouring 
indifference and hatred. All that is a nutrient medium for 
social and inter-ethnic conflicts, extremism in politics, 
tension in society". 
  Yeltsin expressed the conviction that "the involvement of 
Christian communities of various confessions in the constructive 
peace-making processes will be of great benefit. Religious 
leaders can stay the hand of a killer by force of wise words and 
by virtue of their moral prestige, help people to start dialogue 
and convince them of necessity to return to peace and mutual 
understanding". 
  "I believe that you will pool your efforts and will actively 
promote the advancement of the peoples of the newly independent 
states towards accord and cooperation in the spirit of freedom, 
mutual tolerance and well-wishing. 
  "I will continue to support the joint peace-making efforts 
of 
CIS and Baltic Christians and your cooperation with the 
believers of other religions and non-religious people in common 
concern for the well-being of our states," the message said.

  [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- A nation-wide 
poaching-control operation called "Zaslon" which was launched on 
Monday, will protect Russia's national wealth, said here on 
Monday Rear-Admiral Sergey Skalinov, deputy commander of Russian 
naval border forces, in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the admiral, all ships took their assigned 
positions and started fulfilling their duties. 
  The poaching-control operation is being conducted on the 
Barents, Baltic, Black, Azov and Caspian seas, Lake Chudskoye, 
the Amur and Ussuri rivers. It involves, along with border 
forces, ships of the Russian Navy, Aviation, the Customs Service 
and other state structures. 
  In the opinion of Skalinov, experience accumulated during 
the 
first stage of a previous poaching-control operation which was 
carried out in the Pacific, enabled military authorities to 
deploy forces in a short period of time and establish 
cooperation between them. 
  The admiral said that the second stage of the 
poaching-control operation in the Pacific was launched 
successfully on Monday. Vice-Admiral Nikolay Kudinov, commander 
of naval forces of Russian border troops, is in charge of this 
operation. 
  "The main task of these large-scale operations is to prevent 
the pillage of Russia's national wealth, along with strict 
observance of international norms and rules," the admiral 
concluded.

  [Text] The Russian Supreme Court's Military Collegium is to 
continue the trial of one of the 1991 coup leaders Valentin 
Varennikov, a spokesman for the Military Collegium confirmed in 
an interview with Interfax on Monday. Varennikov faces charges 
of high treason and conspiring with the aim of seizing power. 
  Varennikov is the only leader of the 1991 coup, who did not 
agree to being granted political amnesty, announced by the State 
Duma on February 23, 1994, and who demanded that the trial be 
continued. The cases against the other defendants were 
terminated. 
  Varennikov denied all charges brought against him during the 
preliminary investigation and in court. His interests will be 
represented by lawyer Dmitriy Shteynberg. 
  Shteynberg's request for terminating the case in the absence 
of any criminal content in Varennikov's actions, was turned 
down, because only the court may take such a decision. 
  Among the witnesses who are expected to appear in court are 
former commander in chief of the Soviet airborne troops 
Vladislav Achalov, Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Boris 
Gromov, former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and former 
Soviet defense minister Dmitriy Yazov. 
  The hearings will be chaired by Major-General Viktor Yaskin.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Nikitinskiy: "Zhirinovskiy's `No-Lose' </F>
Case"] 
  [Text] On 15 June the State Duma chairman's office 
received an official submission from the general prosecutor 
requesting that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's immunity as deputy be 
lifted in connection with the institution of criminal 
proceedings against him. 
  We have learned that after Aleksey Kazannik instituted a 
criminal case 26 January on the grounds that the book "Last Dash 
to the South" incited war and whipped up interethnic strife, its 
author -- V. Zhirinovskiy -- was questioned as a witness by an 
investigator from the Main Military Prosecutor's Office. A 
number of expert assessments of the case were made -- 
philosophical, psychological, and military-historical -- which 
concluded that certain passages of the aforesaid work did indeed 
contain indications of calls for war and the whipping up of 
ethnic strife. The work done at the Prosecutor's Office, in the 
opinion of Acting General Proseuctor A. Ilyushenko, makes it 
possible to charge V. Zhirinovskiy under Articles 71 and 74 of 
the Russian Federation Criminal Code. But, since he is a State 
Duma deputy, this requires his consent. 
  Under Article 20 of the Law on the Status of Deputies, the 
Duma should examine the General Prosecutor's Office submission 
within one week and provide a reasoned response. The decision 
to agree ("yes") or refuse ("no") to institute criminal 
proceedings against Zhirinovskiy should be adopted under the 
ordinary standing order regulations by a majority of all the 
deputies. 
  Most of the various faction leaders and deputies polled by 
this writer 15 June believe that the Duma will not hand 
Zhirinovskiy over to the Prosecutor's Office, however odious he 
may be. The submission will most probably not be backed by the 
Communists, the agrarian faction, the Democratic Party of 
Russia, or the "Women of Russia" -- not to mention 
Zhirinovskiy's supporters themselves. They do not need to vote 
against, they need only abstain or refuse to exercise their 
vote. The majority of deputies from "Russia's Choice," 
"Yabloko," the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and the "12 
December Union" will vote in favor of the Prosecutor's Office 
submission, cunningly aware that their votes will still not be 
enough. 
  The only original answer that differed from the common model 
was provided by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, who believed that an 
agreement could be reached with the left wing on "handing over" 
Zhirinovskiy if the favor were to be repaid, for instance, with 
a seat in the government. But nobody is likely to pay this 
price for him -- moreover, such complex and convoluted ploys 
need thorough preparation, whereas the General Prosecutor's 
Office submission was sprung on the Duma. 
  The problem for the deputies lies first in setting a 
precedent by stripping a colleague of his deputy's immunity -- 
given that, in the future, the Criminal Code will unfortuantely 
smile not only on Zhirinovskiy and not only on this kind of 
"ideological" crime. Second, if Zhirinovskiy loses his mandate 
as deputy in any further development of this scenario, a 
collapse will threaten not just the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia -- his disappearance from the Duma (where, incidentally, 
he has been quite quiet of late) is likely to destabilize the 
equilibrium which has been achieved to a certain extent here and 
to reshuffle the entire makeup of the corps of deputies (with 
consequences which would be hard to predict). 
  If we made the rather unprobable but not altogether 
impossible assumption that the majority of deputies would 
nonetheless back Ilyushenko's submission, then the Main Military 
Prosecutor's Office would have to continue its investigation, 
interrogate Zhrinovskiy as the accused, and, if necessary, hold 
confrontation interviews. 
  Once the investigation is over the indictment would be sent 
to the court. Article 74 Part 1, which incriminates 
Zhirinovskiy (incitement of ethnic strife), provides for a fine 
and up to three years' imprisonment. Conversely, Article 71 
(propagandizing war), which has hitherto never been actually 
applied in practice, provides for between three and eight years' 
imprisonment. But most probably (although we would once again 
add the rider that such a turn of events is unlikely) the courts 
would find a way to hand down a punishment that did not actually 
involve incarceration. 
  In this event the subjugator of India would gain a criminal 
record and the status of convict, but would not lose his 
deputy's mandate, which would not be stripped automatically in 
this event, but only after a new Duma decision. The Duma could 
vote for the mandate to be retained even in the event of 
Zhirinovskiy being sentenced to a punishment actually involving 
incarceration (Article 4 of the Law on the Status of Deputies). 
The considerations which will guide his colleagues in this 
event are the same as in the case of stripping him of his 
deputy's immunity. 
  But by following through the most extreme version of this 
unfolding scenario, we are geting further away from the 
genuinely likely outcome. Most probably, the criminal case 
against Zhirinovskiy will be reliably obstructed at the first 
stage -- that is, next week. And such a decision would 
fundamentally suit everyone. 
  The Prosecutor's Office will do its formal duty, and Acting 
General Prosecutor Ilyushenko will score another point in the 
light of the likely resubmission to the Federation Council of 
his candidacy for the post of general prosecutor; Zhirinovskiy 
will get additional political publicity, without which he would 
become reminiscent of a deflated and wrinkled child's balloon; 
the Duma as a whole would retain the relatively balanced and 
monolithic nature of its ranks; deputies standing on nationalist 
positions would take great pride in having saved their soul 
mate; the democratic factions would be able to accuse their 
opponents of harboring instigators of war; and finally, the 
president will be given a pretext to level the selfsame 
accusation against parliament as a whole, a pretext which could 
usefully be held in reserve. Generally speaking, no one could 
lose.

<F P=106> [Unattributed comment: "Issue Disrupted"] </F>
  [Text] We ask you to forgive us, dear readers -- the 
Saturday issue dated 18 June did not reach you. On the night 
before publication V.P. Leontyev, director of the "Pressa" 
publishing house, decreed that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA should be 
suspended. Why? Old debts, we were "eating" other people's 
paper.... 
  Excuse us, but this has been said dozens of times -- in 
court, in arbitration, in the government, in the committee for 
the press, with the publishing house leadership.... The debts 
were formed mainly as a result of the newspaper's illegal (as 
the court established) closure in October 1993 for two and 
one-half months on orders from the Ministry for the Press and 
the Mass Media headed by V.F. Shumeyko. Even then they amounted 
to the astronomical sum of 1.2 billion. We could have settled 
debts with the "Pressa" publishing house three times over. But 
neither Shumeyko nor anyone else wants to settle debts for their 
illegal actions.... The question of subsidies for the press 
remained hanging and only what are called "state" publications 
close to their hearts were generously subsidized. 
  After the spring quarantine established for it by the 
publishing house SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA appealed for help to readers 
and other newspapers. The received the most vigorous support 
from the people -- tens of millions of rubles. With this money 
we are buying paper, paying for the production and 
transportation of current issues. This survival probably seemed 
too impertinent to the publisher and he remembered his old debts 
and suspended the newspaper. 
  In their speeches State Duma deputies protested this 
treatment of the opposition people's newspaper. Chamber deputy 
chairman A.N. Chilingarov was instructed to conduct the 
necessary talks on resuming publication. The committee for 
information and communications under the chairmanship of M.N. 
Poltoranin suggested forming a commission including 
representatives of the State Duma and government to resolve this 
unusual conflict. The publishing house agreed to publish a few 
issues of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA if, it said, there was money to 
back them up.... We backed them with your hard-earned rubles, 
dear friends. 
  We take this opportunity to express to you, dear friends, 
our 
heartfelt thanks for the newspaper's support. The preliminary 
results of subscription for the second half of the year have 
just become known. All similar publications have substantial 
losses compared with January, with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI restoring 
only 7.6 percent of its subscription, losing 484,000 
subscribers. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA has no losses -- it has restored 
128.6 percent of its January subscribers. The money submitted 
by readers would be enough to settle its debts and to publish 
the newspaper regularly. The state organizations only have to 
put it at the editorial office's disposal. We hope for 
effective aid from deputies. At any rate today it is thanks to 
the deputies that we are with you again!

<F P=106> [Report "based on data from the Russian Federation </F>
Government Economic Conditions Center Department for Price 
Analysis and Forecasting: "The Week's Prices 31 May-7 June: 
Volga Region Outstrips Everywhere Else"] 
  [Excerpts] According to current state statistics, in the 
past week the overall index of inflation was 102 percent, and 
since the beginning of the year it has increased 80 percent. 
[passage omitted] 
  At the beginning of June the change in prices for fruit (8.8 
percent) and vegetables (2.9 percent) was still appreciable. 
Prices for fish products, butter and vegetable oil, eggs, and 
vodka stayed virtually at last week's level. Food product 
prices in the Central Chernozem region went up more -- by 5.1 
percent -- than in other regions, with new-crop fruit and 
vegetable produce increasing by an average of 50 percent against 
increases of 6 percent for confectionery products and tea and 5 
percent for bread and flour products and pasta products. 
  At the same time price increases for food goods were less 
than 1 percent in the Northwest, Volga-Vyatka, and Urals regions. 
  As of 17 June the average cost of the basket of the 19 most 
important food products was 55,400 rubles [R], an increase of 
2.7 percent during the week and 80 percent since the beginning 
of the year. This basket cost R53,400 at official trade prices 
and R68,000 at unofficial trade prices. 
  In the past week the basket's cost has increased by over 10 
percent in 12 of the 132 cities being monitored. The biggest 
increases were recorded in cities of the Volga region -- 18.3 
percent in Naberezhnyye Chelny and 13.5 percent in Ulyanovsk. 
Ulyanovsk was affected by an increase in prices for fruit and 
vegetable produce, while in Naberezhnyye Chelny bread became on 
average 50 percent more expensive and certain meat products, 
vegetable oil, and eggs became an average of 20-30 percent more 
expensive. 
  In the past week the basket's cost remained virtually 
unchanged in the Central Chernozem and East Siberia regions. 
  As of 7 June the cost of the basket of the 19 most important 
food products was R61,100 in Moscow. It was R54,600 in St. 
Petersburg. Moscow moved from 34th to 36th place in the list of 
cities being monitored, while St. Petersburg is still in 49th 
place. 
  In the past week prices for nonfood goods increased more 
slowly than those for food products and paid consumer services 
-- by 1 percent, which is the lowest weekly figure in the entire 
period since the liberalization of prices began. 
  Yakutsk, Novyy Urengoy, Nakhodka, and 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy remain the most "expensive" in terms 
of the level of prices for nonfood goods.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Gavrilyuk: "Bread Will Get Dearer. </F>
Much Dearer, `Roskhleboprodukt' Corporation Chairman Believes"] 
  [Text] As is frequently the case in our country, gloom 
abruptly turned to uncommon joy at the mention of the upcoming 
harvest. It was clear to everyone that, if there are more ears 
in the fields, Russia will not have to buy grain abroad this 
year. This is remarkable, of course, but we will have to pay 
more for bread at the store. And there had been rumors that the 
price of bread would go up in June. 
  Unfortunately these rumors have been borne out. Bread has 
been and is still getting dearer, and the price will continue to 
go up. Maybe not in June, but in the middle or at the end of 
the summer 1 kg of bread will cost around 950 rubles [R]. As 
always, the search for a culprit has begun. 
  Agrarian Party of Russia Chairman Mikhail Lapshin stated 
that 
this fact is "in no way connected with demands by the peasantry 
to boost state support for the agro-industrial complex." 
Moreover, Mikhail Ivanovich stressed: "Agricultural producers 
categorically oppose price rises since they gain nothing from 
them. The peasant's cut of the retail price is just 8-10 
percent, whereas it is the government that is allowing bread 
prices to be ratcheted up without restraint by increasing the 
cost of grain storage, transportation, and processing and the 
actual trade in bread." 
  It is extremely difficult right now to keep track of the 
grain situation in our country, and the picture is pretty 
clouded anyway because everyone is playing their own game. 
  Nevertheless Leonid Cheshinskiy, president of the 
"Roskhleboprodukt" federal contracting corporation, believes 
that "the corporation is in no way to blame for the price." 
Everything is getting more expensive -- raw materials, fuel and 
energy resources, and all types of services. In his opinion, 
the biggest share of the price hike is accounted for by bank 
credit. Grain currently being stored and processed at the 
corporation's enterprises has been bought on credit at the bank 
rate, hence the increase in the bread price is going to average 
20 percent a month. 
  In addition, however, Leonid Stepanovich acknowledges that 
the corporation was unable to purchase all the grain and that 
grain was left with the farms. Many oblasts purchased it from 
peasants at a price which, as a rule, did not exceed R90,000 a 
tonne. So they used it to bake more or less cheap bread. At 
the present time there is practically no grain left on the 
farms, so now it has to be taken from state resources. The 
grain has already been paid for, it has incurred interest 
charges and storage and processing costs, and the price of grain 
has now risen from R120,000 to R150,000 on the other side of the 
Urals. 
  The situation is also made worse by the fact that in order 
to 
bring a tonne of wheat from Omsk, for example, you need to pay 
R100,000. As a result the full cost of that tonne will be 
R250,000. So you can calculate how much a kilogram of bread 
will cost at the store. 
  But all the indications are that the main problem still lies 
ahead. The fact is that the Russian Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food has already determined purchase prices for arable produce. 
How can the price be determined if, according to the president's 
edict, this is supposed to be done by the market! 
  The answer can be found in letters from the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food that have turned up in the editorial 
office. Apparently, "because of the undeveloped nature of the 
market infrastructure, the lack of experience of working in 
market conditions, and the high level of inflation, agricultural 
production, procurement, and processing enterprises are 
experiencing considerable difficulties in determining an 
advantageous market price." So the Ministry has set guideline 
purchase prices. For example, this year wheat will be bought 
for R220,000 a tonne compared to R65,000 last year. Add to this 
mark-ups and costs totaling another 30 percent, and you end up 
with the price we have to pay for bread at the store. This is 
how the market determines the cost. And then the whole cycle 
starts up again: If grain goes up, so does meat, and therefore 
the cost of technology and gas goes up too.... Basically, 
nobody is to blame. It is unclear who can break this vicious 
circle. Possibly the "Roskhleboprodukt" corporation, which has 
basically become a private company and naturally has an interest 
in buying grain as cheaply as possible, even abroad if need be.

  [Text] If the Russian farming sector does not have nearly 
nine trillion rubles credits, much of the next harvest would be 
lost, Aleksandr Nazarchuk, State Duma Agricultural Committee 
chairman, told Interfax Sunday. 
  The credits, he said, must be granted on easy terms rather 
than at the unbearable discount rate of 210 percent. He 
complained that the agricultural sector was neglected as far as 
financing was concerned. 
  The updated draft budget that was supported by the Agrarian 
Party in the Duma would appropriate over 10.8 trillion rubles, 
of which over four trillion as support of most important 
industries, for agricultural needs. As of mid-June, however, as 
little as 9.26 and 1.94 pct of these amounts, respectively, have 
been made available, Nazarchuk said. 
  He added that the Finance Ministry had promised to make as 
much money available to the farming sector as the budget had 
appropriated. 
  Even if it does, however, the Agrarian Party cannot rule out 
the possibility of protest actions undertaken by the Russian 
peasants. The national convention of peasants may have a 
significant role to play in such actions. The date of the 
convention will be set by the Agricultural Workers Collective 
Action Council which will meet on June 24.

  [Text] First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets has called on the 
agro-industrial complex not to permit "by any means" a 
repetition of last year's grain losses, which totalled 20 
million tonnes, or 20 pct of the gross harvest (99 million 
tonnes in bunker weight). 
  Soskovets was addressing a conference on preparations for 
harvesting held at the Russian government building. 
  The conference was critical of the agrarian sector's level 
of 
preparedness for harvesting. 
  The grain combine harvester fleet has been reduced by 29 
thousand vehicles since 1993 and of the remaining ones less 50 
percent are operational. As a result each machine will have to 
harvest 260 hectares (compared to the standard 131) and the 
harvesting season will take a whole month, whereas the optimal 
harvesting period is no more than 15-17 days. 
  Soskovets asked manufacturers to urgently supply farm 
workers 
with 1,575 grain harvesters on credit supported by government 
guarantees, and called on the economics and finance ministries 
to pool efforts with the Central Bank of Russia to look into the 
possibility of financing the agro-industrial complex on 
favorable terms. The Russian government, Soskovets said, will 
take a number of urgent measures to make preparations for 
harvesting already this week. 
  He strongly criticized the AIC leaders, in particular, such 
sub- units as the Rosagrosnab and Roskhleboprodukt joint-stock 
companies and the associations of Rosagrokhim which had assumed 
new names but failed to become full-fledged market structures to 
this day. Soskovets said that there was no united 
agro-industrial complex in the country, only fragmented 
structures in no way responsible for the farmers' end product.

  [Text] The Russian State Committee for Statistics reports 
that the increase in prices of consumer goods and services 
during the period from 8 through 14 June was the smallest since 
the beginning of the year: 0.8 percent. During that week food 
prices rose by 0.7 percent, nonfood prices rose by 0.9 percent, 
and prices of consumer services rose by one percent. 
  The cost of the basket of 19 basic foodstuffs was 56,000 
rubles [R] for one month's consumption. The maximum cost of the 
basket was R150,400 in Magadan, and the minimum was R35,800 in 
Ulyanovsk. Since the beginning of the year the cost of 
individual types of housing and municipal services has increased 
six to eight times, the cost of travel on trains and city buses 
has increased four to five times, the cost of places in 
children's preschool establishments has trebled, and it is now 
twice as expensive to stay in sanatoriums and recreation centers.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Mikhail Krushinskiy] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 20 TASS -- The first stage of the big 
sell-off in Russia has entered the home stretch. From June 1 
[as received], the so-called voucher privatisation will 
automatically switch to privatisation for ready money. This 
poses serious problems for Russians and encourages some of them 
to heightened activity. 
  The majority, those who have already acquired portions of 
the 
national wealth in exchange for vouchers, are in suspense 
because only trade in shares for money will make clear the real 
price of what they have acquired. Not all of them have a clear 
idea of the functioning of the market mechanism. Hence, 
confusion and disappointment of those who see security as a 
source of certain mandatory and steady income. The simple fact 
that the loss-making enterprises will never give any dividends 
to the holders of their shares can become a source of serious 
social tension. 
  The minority, those who have not yet invested their vouchers 
and not sold them for cash, are no less tense. True, official 
sources keep encouraging the hope that the exchange rate of the 
voucher is likely to jump soon on the anticipation of the 
"choice morsels" being put on the bloc on the last voucher 
auctions. The common sense prompts however that if on July 1 
the price of the voucher will equal nil, the day before it must 
be very close to nil. The only help the late-comers can count 
on is that the voucher stage will be prolonged, but this hope is 
growing less and less with every passing day. 
  The most serious tests will have to be taken and passed by 
the direct participants in the upcoming "big-time game", 
entities on the domestic stock market. It has hardly taken 
shape and looks like forest path minutes before powerful motor 
vehicle are due to begin their onward march along it. Russia 
has a few dozens of stock markets, all of which are presumably 
ready to receive the swelling tide of securities but have very 
few experienced stock market dealers and brokers, not enough 
floor space and offices, no more than a trickle of financial 
resources and virtually no modern technical equipment at all. 
As a result, trading in shares of privitised enterprises will 
inevitably spill out onto the streets and be carried out in 
wild, uncivilised forms. Some people will probably snatch and 
run, others will feel deceived, and altogether will hardly feel 
secure. 
  In developed market economies trading in securities is 
seldom 
associated with their physical movement. They are usually kept 
in specialised depositories and when a deal is struck, the only 
thing that changes is a record in the electronic memory. All 
stock markets are interlinked with a system of modem and 
computer communication, which enables the client to buy or sell 
his shares wherever he or she may be at the moment, free of any 
fear of deception. Russia with its vast expanses needs such a 
system more than any other country. Will it create a system of 
this kind in foreseeable future. 
  Quite possible, according to Sergey Kravchuk, vice-president 
of Moscow's central stock market. But this will require a 
serious support on the part of the state, particularly at the 
outset. The stock markets themselves, which, as is known, are 
non-profit organisations, will be unable to cope with this heavy 
financial load on their own. There is no point in counting on 
the dissociated participants in the stock market who are only 
keen, quite naturally, on their own profit. 
  Mr. Kravchuk bemoans the fact that Russia has yet to pass a 
law on the securities market. The only regulatory enactment on 
which the stock markets can rely is the government resolution 
dated December 1991 and covering only shares and bonds, and 
saying nothing about promissory notes, cheques and other 
securities. A draft law on securities was recently drawn up by 
the Central Bank, and an alternative draft was worked out by the 
Russian Union of Stock Markets. But it will take time for the 
parliament to consider the drafts, while only ten days remain 
before the "D-Day" on which the "voucher dam" is scheduled to 
fall. 
  The legislative vacuum will be at least partially filled by 
a 
presidential decree, which is expected to be published one of 
these days. It remains to be regretted that Russia is again 
coming up to an important turning point in its economic reform 
without due preparation.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State </F>
Committee for the Management of State Property, to Mayak 
observer Vladimir Pasko; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The present concept of privatization is based on 
vouchers, which the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property has issued free of charge to Russian citizens so that 
they can acquire property. I can cite the figures, by the way: 
Our mid-June results show that over 140 million privatization 
vouchers will be collected by the end of the voucher 
privatization [30 June]. This is guaranteed. May be we will 
even hit 145 million. 
  Let me remind you that 148 million vouchers have been 
issued. 
This means, in fact, that an absolute majority of the population 
has had an opportunity to invest their vouchers. The state has 
provided property for these vouchers -- has come up with the 
goods, so to say. This was very important for us because many 
previous state programs were based on vouchers before but 
failed: Vouchers for harvest-1990, for northerners, for consumer 
durables -- the Ryzhkov, Pavlov, and Silayev governments all 
gave vouchers a try. All these efforts failed. Our 
privatization voucher program is the first to make good the 
voucher promises. 
  The final stage of the privatization -- the June voucher 
auctions -- is a unique voucher booster: In June we are 
offering twice as much property for sale as for the total of 
1994, including the Norilsk Nickel works, a superb enterprise 
with a great export potential. [passage omitted] 
  Now we have the moral right to say: enough, the voucher 
privatization, the free privatization now ends. Everybody has 
had a chance to invest the vouchers. [passage omitted] 
  On 30 June we are beginning a new program, in which money 
and 
finances are the most important. This money will be invested 
primarily in enterprises themselves. How is this going to 
happen? We will use the tried and tested approaches -- including 
auctions. But these are going to be money auctions, not voucher 
auctions. 
  For example, an enterprise will issue a packet of shares 
worth 40 percent of its value. This 40 percent packet will be 
offered for sale, at a real auction, for money, with a hammer. 
There may be three, five, 10, or 15 buyers, and the packet will 
go to the highest bidder. Most of the money the bidder has paid 
will go to the enterprise, so it can buy new equipment, cut 
costs, or do market research. The remaining shares may also be 
sold. 
  Some sales may be conditional, for instance on ecological 
grounds: You can buy this enterprise, but you must know that 
within five years you must reduce the waste the enterprise 
throws into the air or into the water. These procedures are 
possible, they are envisaged by our document. [passage omitted] 
  Some people say that this is privatization for the rich, and 
that the grass roots will not benefit. This is a false 
impression. Look at what is happening. The rich, those who are 
able to spend a lot of money at tenders, invest in an 
enterprise, which already has shareholders from the first stage 
of the transfer to joint stock -- members of the work collective 
who received the 51 percent of shares in-house for example, or 
those who received shares of the enterprise at voucher auctions. 
So in fact, those who became shareholders at the first stage of 
the privatization free of charge are gaining access to financial 
resources at the second stage. The shareholders win, the 
enterprise wins, and hence the economy wins. So let me say 
again that the whole thrust of the new privatization beginning 1 
July is in building up enterprises themselves. [passage omitted] 
  The final objective of the first stage of the privatization 
was expressed in quantitative terms to create a wide class of 
shareholders. Even our most fierce opponents agree that there 
are 40 million shareholders in Russia. Let me remind you that 
Russia's adult population is 70 million, so in fact there are 70 
million owners. They often do not understand what it means and 
what rights they have, what they can or cannot do, or what 
dividends they will receive. However, they are owners, and you 
cannot take away from them the share or shares they own. For us 
it means that the main objective has been reached: a class of 
property owners has been created. [passage omitted] 
  The objective of the second stage is that privatized 
enterprises must be encouraged to develop quality, not quantity. 
They should be encouraged to undergo reconstruction -- this is 
becoming a key word for us now -- and to fit into the new market 
using the finances they will have access to at the second state 
of the privatization. [passage omitted] 
  I believe the second stage will last two to three years. It 
will finish of its own accord, when all packets of shares are 
sold. But as it draws to a close, it will create the secondary 
market, an important factor of a market economy. The owner of 
the packet may sell it at some stage, so capital will start 
moving -- from less productive to more productive enterprises. 
This is what economists call the capital market, without which 
the goods market will not exist. [passage omitted] Russian 
privatization will reach this objective.

<F P=106> ["Abridged" account of statement by the International Reform </F>
Foundation under the "Appraisal" rubric: "First Package of 
Presidential Edicts: One Step Forward, Two Steps Back"] 
  [Text] The International Reform Foundation has 
consistently adhered to a socially oriented model of a market 
economy which can be built only with active regulation by the 
state. 
  The president's edicts point to the intention to enhance the 
role of the state in economic regulation. The spheres where 
control by the executive branch should be reinforced have been 
identified correctly: These are credit and monetary relations, 
tax policy, foreign economic activity, and regulation of the 
state sector. Amid the obvious weakening of the government's 
role the president has correctly taken the initiative and 
demonstrated through these edicts his determination further to 
reform the Russian economy. 
  However, an objective assessment of the essence of the 
edicts 
promulgated shows that behind their purported good intentions 
lie antimarket and antidemocratic measures. 
  After analyzing the edicts, the Reform Foundation has come 
to 
the following conclusions: 
  First. The edicts are largely of an antisocial character. 
Thus, the rate of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund 
has been cut by two points. 
  The edict on tax policy contains a proposal to increase the 
level of taxation of incomes of individuals and their property. 
The document shows that this will affect virtually all strata 
of the population, including highly paid white and blue collar 
workers, not only rich entrepreneurs. 
  The edict on normalizing financial settlements has imposed 
covert limitations on the release of funds for the payment of 
wages. 
  The edict on reform of state enterprises covertly annuls the 
guarantees, arising from the labor laws, for continuation of 
labor relations with an employee in the event of an enterprise's 
reorganization. 
  Second. The edicts seriously undermine partner relations 
between commercial banks and their clients, both private 
individuals and corporate entities. 
  Contracts between private citizens and banking 
establishments 
always contain a guarantee of the secrecy of deposits. Under 
the edict on measures to ensure timely and complete payment of 
taxes, banks are now obligated to inform tax bodies about any 
transactions by citizens in a sum equivalent to $10,000 or more. 
In the present conditions this will undoubtedly cause 
withdrawals of personal deposits or force citizens to fragment 
their deposits and legally open dozens of accounts with various 
banks in order to relieve them of the function of "snoopers." 
  With respect to corporate entities and banks, this edict 
provides for a norm abolishing the parties' obligations 
regarding terms for keeping deposits on accounts. As of now 
money from a deposit account may be compulsorily written off at 
any moment by a tax body. Therefore the client will be deprived 
of interest and the bank of resources. 
  Third. The edicts do not address the most acute problem: 
elimination of the nonpayments crisis. 
  Administrative measures aimed at tightening control over the 
opening of accounts, establishing a calendar sequence of 
payments, and granting tax inspectorates the right to 
uncontested writing off of payments, in the context of 
hypertrophied imbalances between money and commodity supply, 
cannot normalize monetary circulation. 
  Promissory notes surely help partially address the problem 
of 
settlements between enterprises but do not eliminate the 
nonpayments crisis. 
  Fourth. The edicts do not stimulate investment activity. 
  Only two provisions of the edicts touch on this major 
problem. The first is the intention to cut tax rates and the 
second is tax breaks for enterprises with a large share of 
foreign capital. 
  However, the declared quantitative reduction of taxes by 
10-20 percent (not points) in fact means negligible amounts, 
which certainly does not stimulate business or investment 
activity. Furthermore, the edict applies this requirement only 
to federal taxes while local bodies may decide on tax problems 
at their own discretion and proceeding from the needs of the 
local budget. 
  As far as the new tax breaks for enterprises with a share of 
foreign capital are concerned, the following question should be 
put to the authors of the edict: How many enterprises are there 
in Russia whose incorporation capital includes a share of no 
less than $10 million paid in by a foreign partner? At best not 
more than a dozen, and therefore this break is targeted at 
specific individuals. Then you should name them. 
  This provision will not attract new investors because no one 
has yet taken care to give them reliable guarantees or make our 
tax legislation stable for at least a year. 
  Fifth. The edict lifting export licensing and quantitative 
regulation has strengthened the monopoly position of special 
exporters and their powers to dictate. 
  The abolition of all customs privileges does not take into 
account the need for restructuring and selective support for 
enterprises in priority sectors of the economy. 
  Sixth. The edict on reforming state enterprises reduces all 
problems of state regulation merely to the question of budget 
maintenance of state enterprises. 
  The provision limiting the sphere of creating state 
subsidized enterprises only to industry and agriculture appears 
dubious. Although it is hardly expedient to create state 
enterprises in the countryside -- they should rather exist in 
the transport and communications sector. 
  This sphere is further narrowed to the scope of enterprises 
banned for privatization. And it is only with respect to this 
limited range of enterprises that the state is ready to assume 
the functions of management and support. Therefore 99 percent 
of federal enterprises retaining their status as state 
controlled are of no interest to the state. 
  The president has made a political decision, assuming 
responsibility for further direction and development of reform. 
However, there does not seem to be any logic or plan of action 
behind the edicts issued. 
  Therefore we propose that they be suspended, especially 
inasmuch as they infringe citizens' social rights. 
  We also appeal to the government. Show firmness and finally 
assume the role of initiator of reform strategy and its 
implementation. Stop being a firefighting team. 
  On 10 June this year the president announced that he has 
signed a second package of edicts. The Reform Foundation 
considers it its duty, based on independent appraisal, to 
express its opinion on the second package too, after these 
edicts have been promulgated.

Assekritov, Vadim Bakatin, Vladimir Kiryushin, Stepan Sitaryan,

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In May, the Russian Government's budget owed 
enterprises 8.5 trillion rubles. The figure was mentioned 
during a session of the public chamber of the Russian president 
by Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy prime minister and minister for the 
economy in the government. 
  The deputy prime minister believes that using privatization 
income to set up an extra-budgetary fund, which could be put 
into anything from the defense sector to the socio-cultural 
sphere, could be one way out of the difficult financial 
situation.

  [Text] This year Russia will earmark 305 billion rubles 
for closing unprofitable coal mines. For the first time the 
Russian state budget envisages a separate category for 
expenditure on such objectives. 
  In the near future, according to "Rosugol" Company Deputy 
Chairman N. Garkavenko, there are plans to complete work on 
closing down five unprofitable pits, including pits in the 
Pechora coal field. Another six pits will be shut down before 
the end of 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Livshits: "Anyone Who Wants To Buy a </F>
House Can Pay by Installments. Aleksandr Livshits, Head of the 
Russian Federation President's Group of Experts, Comments on the 
Latest Edicts Aimed at Developing the Reforms"] 
  [Text] The edicts signed by the president affect the 
interests of millions of Russians. In the first place, this 
relates to documents offering people new opportunities for 
solving the housing problem. 
  Three edicts were signed: on housing credits, on housing 
certificates, and on the sale of unfinished houses. As for 
housing credits, government decree No. 1278, dated 10 December 
1993, approved the statutes on granting Russian citizens in need 
of better housing conditions free subsidies to build or acquire 
housing. Consequently, it is a matter for the government, which 
must keep its word. 
  More significant is the edict on housing certificates, which 
enables anyone wishing to do so to buy housing by installments. 
Under the president's edict, corporate bodies that have the 
requisite documents, a plot of land, and a house that is in the 
process of being built, are entitled to issue a new type of 
security, a "housing certificate," provided they have gone 
through the obligatory Finance Ministry licensing process and 
their activities in connection with the certificates are 
guaranteed by a bank or some other credit institution. 
  Any Russian citizen will be able to buy a certificate and 
pay 
for it gradually, initially, for example, by buying one square 
meter, thus gradually accumulating the housing space. The 
certificates are absolutely liquid, that is, they can be sold. 
But if a citizen has accumulated 30 percent of an apartment, 
then under the Statutes he is entitled to apply to the issuing 
body (the one that bought up the property) and conclude a 
contract for the apartment, bearing in mind that the remaining 
forms of payment are already regulated. Certainly, further 
instructions are needed from the Finance Ministry and Central 
Bank, but the way is clear to making it easier to tackle the 
housing problem. 
  On the one hand, there are now people who have money and 
want 
to buy apartments. On the other hand, we have finished or 
almost finished construction projects and houses. Construction 
organizations are building or are prepared to build. The idea 
behind housing certificates is that they bring together the 
interests of those who want to buy apartments and those who have 
housing to offer. But all this must be strictly supervised by 
the state.

  [Text] Russia's Navy regards as unacceptable the powers of 
the Federal Atomic Surveillance Committee to control naval 
nuclear power installations. 
  The Committee's Spokesman Yuriy Rogozhin told Interfax, his 
office received a letter from the Navy Commander, Admiral Felix 
Gromov, proposing interdepartmental inspection over nuclear 
safety in the navy. 
  He said the committee is currently empowered to license army 
units for running their nuclear or radioactive facilities and 
inspect them. These powers were backed up by a decree issued by 
the president on November 12, 1992. 
  The committee believes interdepartmental inspection instead 
of state control could lead to incidents at naval nuclear sites.

<F P=106> [Interview with Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the </F>
Baltic Fleet, by Captain First Class Valeriy Gromak; place and 
date not given: "New Face of Baltic Fleet. Baltic Fleet 
Commander Admiral Vladimir Yegorov Answers KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
Correspondent's Questions"] 
  [Text] [Gromak] Vladimir Grigoryevich, the Russian flag 
was lowered over Liepaja Naval Base on the first day of summer. 
The last day of summer will also be the last day spent by 
Russian sailors in any of the Baltic countries. What next? 
What will the [Baltic] Fleet look like once the force 
withdrawal process has been completed? 
  [Yegorov] First and foremost -- and this is the main thing 
-- the Fleet should remain the Fleet, as an integrated 
operational-strategic formation of the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces in the Baltic designed to protect the Russian state's 
interests in the region. 
  Of course, the face of the Fleet will be different from what 
it was prior to the withdrawal of forces from the Baltic states, 
where we are leaving behind four basing centers, their 
airfields, and a large number (from 15 percent to 80 percent in 
certain cases) of military infrastructure installations -- 
communications units, ship-repair yards, electronic posts, 
installations providing navigation and hydrographic support for 
the safety of shipping in the Baltic, and warehouse 
installations able to store large quantities of material and 
technical means. 
  But we have completely withdrawn both warships and 
auxiliaries, all our aircraft, motor vehicles, technical 
systems, and stores, and are relocating them on the territory of 
Kaliningrad and Leningrad Oblasts. The basing conditions will 
be more cramped, of course, but there will be no other losses. 
  [Gromak] But perhaps there should be further cuts that would 
make it possible to improve basing conditions? 
  [Yegorov] Apart from Russia, nine other states have access 
to the Baltic Sea. And each has a navy as a most important 
component of its armed forces. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, 
having gained independence and despite their serious economic 
difficulties, are also setting up their own navies. And that is 
entirely natural. Each state in our by no means peaceful age 
should be prepared to defend its interests not only on land but 
at sea as well. These include prospecting for oil on the 
continental shelf, fishery protection, and ensuring the safety 
of merchant shipping. So Russia too should have a modern navy 
to safeguard security and protect its own state interests in the 
Baltic. 
  [Gromak] What will the Baltic Fleet be like? 
  [Yegorov] There will be two naval bases within the Baltic 
Fleet -- the Baltiysk and Leningrad bases -- one force of major 
surface combatants, one force each of auxiliaries and 
search-and-rescue vessels, the Fleet air force, coastal troops, 
and logistical, technical, and special units. The Baltic 
squadron of various force organizations and the assault landing 
ship force will be disbanded. 
  [Gromak] Does this mean that, apart from things being 
disbanded and cut back, there will also be an expansion via the 
Leningrad Naval Base? 
  [Yegorov] Essentially the Leningrad Naval Base is already to 
a considerable extent part of the Fleet and under its 
operational jurisdiction. Now that Lithuania and Belorussia 
[Belarus] have become independent states and Kaliningrad 
Oblast's territorial isolation from other parts of Russia has 
become a reality, we face the acute issue of the need to have a 
rear services base to build up stores and prepare reserves on 
the main territory of Russia. The Leningrad Naval Base will 
fulfill the role of such a rear services base for the Fleet.

  [Text] Sergey Adamchik, a senior official at the Russian 
State Nuclear Safety Agency, told Interfax that Russia at 
present cannot modernize the power units of first generation 
nuclear stations that do not meet modern safety standards. He 
said that because of inadequate financing the agency cannot 
afford rapid checking of the reactors. "The government can 
economize on everything, except safety at nuclear facilities," 
Adamchik said. 
  He said safety at first generation power units was discussed 
at an international conference in Obninsk held under the 
auspices of the International Nuclear Energy Agency. In 
addition to Russia it was attended by 12 West and East European 
countries as well as Japan. The conference stressed the burning 
need to modernize first generation stations depending on the 
economic and political situation in each country.

Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, and the Republic of 
Lithuania" issued in Tallinn on 13 June; from the Latvian 
Foreign Ministry Information Bulletin No. 24/94 (55), 13-20 
June; received via Internet BALT-L] 
  [Text] We, the Heads of Government of the Baltic States, 
exchanged views on the troop withdrawal agreement signed by 
Latvia and the Russian Federation on April 30, 1994, and on the 
progress of the negotiations between Estonia and the Russian 
Federation. 
  We continue to demand that all military forces of the 
Russian 
Federation must be unconditionally withdrawn from the 
territories of Estonia and Latvia by August 31, 1994, and we 
urge the international community to continue to call on Russia 
to respect this deadline. We expressed our conviction that the 
Russian Federation's policy of linking unrelated bilateral 
issues with the implementation of most- favoured-nation status 
in trade relations with the Baltic States is in violation of 
principles of GATT and of good-neighbourly relations. 
  We exchanged views on our countries' negotiations on Free 
Trade Agreements with the European Union. We expressed our 
preparedness to proceed to Europe Agreements and called on the 
Council of the European Union to issue the mandate for 
negotiations of Europe Agreements with the Baltic States as soon 
as possible. 
  We expressed our particular satisfaction with the adoption 
of 
the status of Association with the Western European Union for 
the nine countries of the Central Europe which were partners in 
the Forum of Consultation. We expressed our conviction that 
this will contribute to the more coherent and balanced 
integration of the Baltic States into European structures. 
  We welcomed the progress made in the implementation of the 
Partnership for Peace programme, and reaffirmed the desire of 
our states to deepen cooperative relations with NATO on the 
basis of common values and principles, paving the way for the 
active and interested partners to play an important role in the 
evolutionary process of the expansion of NATO. We see 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace as a good basis for 
proceeding from partnership to membership in the Alliance. 
  We noted the importance of assistance given by a number of 
states, especially the Nordic countries, for the establishment 
of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion. In this respect, we noted 
that practical cooperation in the framework of Partnership for 
Peace would be an important contribution to the implementation 
and promotion of goals of the Partnership. We agreed to 
elaborate, as soon as possible, an agreement concerning the 
mobilities for the establishment and functioning of the Baltic 
Peacekeeping Battalion. We also discussed the situation in 
Ukraine and agreed that with regard to Crimea we fully support 
the Ukrainian Government in their efforts to reach a peaceful 
solution consistent with the national security requirements of 
Ukraine. We concurred that the stable development of Ukraine is 
of utmost importance to stability in Europe.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The Moscow-based press 
focuses on the 53rd anniversary of Nazi Germany's attack on the 
Soviet Union, opinion polls taken among Muscovites on attitude 
to it, and carries reports on Russia's Federation Council 
decision to bring Russian peacekeepers to the area of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the forthcoming signing of the 
framework document of NATO's Partnership-for-Peace Programme in 
Brussels on Wednesday, on growing unemployment in St. 
Petersburg, and comments on presidential anti- crime decrees. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an article headlined "The 
Memories of June 22, 1941, Prompt Us To Keep Our Powder Dry". 
  "However bitter it sounds but we ourselves in many respects 
provoked the enemy into attacking. Not by aggressiveness or 
by plans of a preventive strike against Germany, as our foes 
maintain, but by our unpreparedness, lack of mobilisation, and, 
to quote Marshal A.M. Vasilevskiy, by fear to cross the line 
which separates normal caution from a criminal expectations. 
  "Herein is the major lesson of June 22, 1941. This is where 
history merges with contemporaneity and the events of the past 
with the most pressing present-day problems of the Russian state 
and its armed forces". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA also carries an article on the tragedy of 
Soviet intelligence service whose reports that Germany was going 
to attack the USSR on June 22 neither Stalin nor his entourage 
believed. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs a series of articles on the subject 
of 
the tragic and heroical days of the beginning of the war. 
  According to the findings of an opinion poll taken the 
newspaper's correspondent nowadays among people on Moscow 
streets from various age and social groups of the population 
about their attitude to the anniversary, young people said that, 
in their view, the Soviet Union's and Russia's contribution to 
the victory over Hitler and German fascism is being belittled in 
the West nowadays, while their parents are now more preoccupied 
with problems of survival and feeding their rather politicised 
children". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA states that the aggregate number of 
people who were killed or died during the Great Patriotic War is 
43.3 million. 
  "Stalin was preparing an attack on Hitler, and the latter, 
unknowingly forestalled him by weeks if not days... 
  "Should Stalin get his blow in first, the course and outcome 
of the war would not have changed. The war remained unjust for 
Stalin and his top entourage who practised expansion and 
perpetrated many crimes against their own people and the whole 
of mankind". 
  The newspaper also runs excerpts from verbatim report about 
the Fuehrer's remarks under the headline "Adolf Hitler: `When We 
Shall Assimilate Russian Expanses..." 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Bismarck's 
grandson, Count Heinrich von Einsiedel-- a German ace pilot who 
was shot down in the skies over Stalingrad and taken prisoner. 
While in captivity he became the vice-president of the National 
Committee Free Germany. 
  "Hitler was a great misfortune for the German people and 
Stalin constituted the same for the Russian people and the 
peoples of the Soviet Union. The two made up a critical mass 
which lead to the outbreak of war. Among other things, Hitler's 
guilt is that he, resorting to a venture by attacking the Soviet 
Union, made Stalin the savior of mankind, although, of course, 
it was the Soviet people who saved the world," Count von 
Einsiedel said in the interview. 
  TRUD singles out a commentary by Stanislav Shatalin, 
academic 
secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Department of 
Economics and president of the Reform Foundation, on the latest 
decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Shatalin said "the decrees attained their goal, stirring the 
lop [as received] of economic stagnation in which Russia has 
found itself. However, the untargeted nature and ambiguity of a 
number of positions gave rise to contradictory opinions about 
the expediencey and effectiveness of the decrees. 
  "As far as the government is concerned, although it 
constantly states of late that it has an economic programme, 
still there are so far no strategy or tactics of reforms that 
would be understandable to the people. Without that, it is not 
very logical to issue a series of decrees to this effect," he 
said. Shatalin believes that the government, not the president, 
should be the initiator of reforms. 
  PRAVDA singles out a report on mounting unemployment in St. 
Petersburg and on the current auctioning of enterprises there 
cheaply to foreign firms. The Svetlana Amalgamation, which was 
once the country's largest enterprise and the pride of national 
electronic instrument-making, is now up for sale. 
  The government newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
  -- reports that the names of millions of co-citizens -- 
servicemen, partisans, members of the volunteer corps, and 
underground fighters -- will be entered in an all-Russia book of 
memory which is to be published by the 50th anniversary of the 
victory. The book will consist of 700 volumes which are to be 
turned over for perpetual storage to the Poklonnaya hill 
memorial complex. 
  -- Frontpages a statement by Aleksandr Belyakov, governor of 
Leningrad region, that Russian governors will "insist on a 
meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in the coming days" to set 
out their views on ways to take the country's economy out of the 
crisis. 
  -- Laments that the recent working visit by Russian 
parliamentary delegation, led by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, 
to Germany, "was passed over in silence" by German news media. 
  -- Points out that Hungarian-made medicines produced by the 
Gedeon Richter plant may disappear from sale in Russia's drug 
stores in view of an instruction issued by the Russian Ministry 
of Health in March that medicines that appear on sale in Russia 
should undergo quality tests. The Hungarian enterprise is not 
against yet another series of tests of its medicines but the 
Ministry did not yet establish a network of laboratories to 
enact its decision.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Andrey Kozyrev: We Proceed on the </F>
Basis of Pure Pragmatism in Cooperation with NATO"] 
  [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced 
Monday [20 June] that during his visit to Brussels, and in 
addition to the document on joining NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative, he will also sign a protocol concerning 
Russia's direct cooperation with NATO. 
  Emphasizing the second document's importance in a 
conversation with journalists, the Russian Federation's foreign 
minister said that Russia is interested "not only, and maybe 
even not so much, in signing the 'Partnership for Peace' 
program, but in the Russia-NATO program." 
  An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by the minister's 
adviser 
Galina Sidorova that the protocol on cooperation with the North 
Atlantic alliance is a "ramified document." She reminded him 
that the program for Russia's cooperation with NATO, which was 
elaborated by Russian experts, was presented by Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev to his NATO partners during his recent visit to 
the alliance headquarters. Afterwards, Russian diplomats and 
their NATO colleagues used it as a basis to prepare a document 
acceptable to both sides. Work is still being done on details, 
but Russia's most important wishes have been taken into account. 
"The protocol will incorporate virtually all provisions in the 
program suggested by us to NATO," G. Sidorova said.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- After signing the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" plan and a bilateral protocol Russia 
will equally cooperate with "major European, leading partners in 
European and global security", Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev told mass media chiefs on Tuesday before departing for 
Brussels where he is to sign the two documents on Wednesday. 
  He added that the "Russia-NATO" protocol reflects the status 
of Russia as a superpower. 
  Kozyrev categorically denied allegations that Russia claimed 
a "special status" in the partnership programme. "We are as 
equal a member of the UN as, say, the State of Fiji. All 
countries have an equal legal status in the framework of the 
(NATO) partnership, whether it is a mighty nuclear power, like 
the USA, or Belgium with its two or three divisions", he said.

<F P=106> [By KRIM-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- Allegations that Russia has leaked 
enriched uranium suitable for the manufacture of nuclear weapons 
have been decisively denied by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, head of the 
Central Public Relations Service, in a conversation with a 
KRIM-TASS correspondent at the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service today. At the same time, he did not 
rule out that there have been instances of radioactive 
components being smuggled out. "Yes, such attempts have been 
made, and we have informed the public that we have put a stop to 
them," he said. "However, no enriched uranium or plutonium 
(apparently used to manufacture arms) has been taken out of 
Russia." 
  Asked about the possibility of a leakage from former Soviet 
republics following the collapse of the USSR, none of the 
participants in the conversation could be equally certain. The 
KRIM-TASS correspondent requested a meeting with 
counterintelligence nuclear experts in connection with the noise 
raised by Western media around the false allegations that Russia 
helped North Korea develop a nuclear bomb and that Russian 
mafia-style groups have control over the nuclear potential of 
Russia itself. 
  Regarding the apprehensions recently expressed by FBI 
Director Louis Freeh that "nuclear materials can be smuggled out 
of Russia into the United States for the purposes of terrorism" 
or that in Russia's black market "components of nuclear weapons 
and highly enriched nuclear materials suitable for the 
manufacture of weapons are being offered for sale," the 
counterintelligence experts said unanimously: "None of the 
world's special services has detected any leakage of any 
components used in the production of nuclear weapons. And even 
Freeh himself could not cite any specific examples. We would 
only thank anyone who could tell us specific facts, since this 
is a matter directly affecting the security of our country." 
"All these conjectures directly affect us counterintelligence 
men. Indeed, the export of strategic uranium and plutonium and 
also of nuclear components allegedly taking place cannot occur 
behind the back of the Federal Counterintelligence Service," the 
KRIM-TASS correspondent was told by a high-ranking official of 
the Russian Federation's Federal Counterintelligence Service. 
"Therefore, experts of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
have deemed it necessary to provide a few explanations." 
  "As for the problem of so-called assistance to North Korea 
in 
creating its own nuclear bomb, be it with technology or with 
experts, various officials of our country have repeatedly 
declared our loyalty to the international agreements. 
Cooperation in this field has been conducted exclusively for 
peaceful purposes and under the supervision of the International 
Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]," said an operational worker of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service who at the end of 1992 
took part in measures to detain a group of Russian nuclear 
experts trying to fly to North Korea. "Thus far we have 
successfully thwarted all such attempts to `recruit' people with 
secret information in the said field, making use of the 
difficult economic situation of our country, and all attempts by 
secret services, including those of North Korea, to extract 
information from nuclear facilities and to steal nuclear 
technologies." 
  "Summing up the conversation with experts from the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, Aleksandr Mikhaylov told the 
KRIM-TASS correspondent that attempts to accuse Russia of being 
incapable of controlling the nonproliferation of its nuclear 
weapons, technology and materials are obviously being made in 
pursuit of political aims. They are aimed at preparing public 
opinion in the West for the idea of establishing political 
control over Russian nuclear weapons."

  [Text] Two Russian battalions in the Caucuses are fully 
prepared for peace-keeping operation in the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict zone, Interfax learned Tuesday at the press center of 
the Russian forces. 
  The center said that the batallions were ready to take 
control of the area allotted to them within a few hours of 
receiving orders. 
  The order could come immediately following the Federation 
Council's approval of the decision of President Yeltsin to send 
peace-keepers to Georgia.

  [Text] The Federation Council's debate on the dispatch of 
Russian peacekeeping forces to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict is one of the most important events of the day. The 
decision was adopted by a majority of votes. 
  [Correspondent Marina Vasilyeva] Today's session of the 
Federation Council began with a debate on the possibility of 
using the Russian Armed Forces for the peacekeeping operation in 
the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The debate, held 
behind closed doors, lasted over an hour. The president's edict 
was ratified as a result. Journalists learned of this first 
from Pavel Grachev, who represented the Russian president at the 
session. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] The Federation Council has adopted 
a positive decision. The debate was conducted in a proper 
manner. The motion won an absolute majority. Seven deputies 
abstained and another seven were against. All the rest voted 
for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. This is a sign -- 
or, for me, an order -- to get started. In literally two or 
three days' time, once Colonel General Kuznetsov has reported to 
me that all engineering and mine clearance work has been 
completed, we will start on the peacekeeping operation proper -- 
in other words, the deployment of outposts, checkpoints, 
observation points, command points. We will start work. [end 
recording] 
  [Vasilyeva] The decision that was adopted gives the go-ahead 
for a contingent of the Russian Armed Forces, numbering up to 
3,000 volunteers, to be used in the peacekeeping operation, with 
an initial mandate of six months. Committees of the Federation 
Council have been instructed to supervise the implementation of 
this decision.

  [Text] Only after mines are removed from the zone of 
disengagement of the Georgian and Abkhaz units along the Inguri 
river shall the first two Russian peacekeeping battalions be 
sent to the conflict zone, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told 
journalists after the Federation Council ratified the 
presidential decree on Russia's involvement in the peacekeeping 
operation in Abkhazia. 
  According to representatives of the defense ministry who 
took 
part in the session of the Federation Council, the decree was 
supported in a 101 to 5 vote with five abstentions. The media 
has not yet received the official results of voting. 
  Grachev also said that two Russian battalions will be moved 
to this region from Batumi soon. A battalion of the 345th 
airborne regiment, located in Gudauta, will also be sent to the 
conflict zone. 
  If three battalions prove to be insufficient, two more 
peacekeeping battalions, located in the Volga and Leningrad 
military districts, will be sent to Abkhazia, said Grachev. He 
added that the peacekeeping battalions would be about 3,000 
strong. 
  He said that the participation of peacekeeping forces from 
other CIS countries was problematical. He noted, however, that 
next September the heads of the CIS countries would discuss the 
peacekeeping operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflict. 
  The heads of state must decide whether to send peacekeeping 
units to Abkhazia or only to finance the operation, Grachev said.

  [Text] The sending of Russian peacekeeping forces to 
Abkhazia is of great significance for Russia, because the 
settlement of the conflict and the stabilization of the 
situation in this dangerous zone are very important, Russia's 
Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov told INTERFAX. 
  "The Caucasus and the Transcaucasus are two mutually related 
regions," said Pastukhov. "A fire in one of them may spread to 
the other. From the international point of view, Russia has 
always played the role of peacemaker, guided by U.N. norms and 
requirements," he added. 
  He also said that this operation would differ from the 
previous ones in that Russian peacekeepers would work jointly 
with U.N. observers.

nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula looks at the present 
moment more topical than ever. This was stated today by Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before his departure by air for 
Brussels. In the Belgian capital he intends to meet and have 
talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  "This meeting," the head of Russian diplomacy noted, "is 
being held on the instructions of the two presidents to examine 
the Korean problem and to agree a common approach in the UN 
Security Council." 
  As yet, he added, we do not have sufficiently complete 
information as to what specifically former U.S. President Jimmy 
Carter managed to achieve as a result of his trip to the DPRK. 
A. Kozyrev voiced the hope that his meeting with the secretary 
of state will help shed light on this question. 
  At the same time, he stated, Moscow cannot be satisfied just 
with the assessments of the U.S. side, but intends to be guided 
primarily by its own understanding of the situation, since the 
problem which has arisen has a direct bearing on the sphere of 
Russia's national interests, indeed geographically the Korean 
Peninsula is located much nearer to Russia than to the United 
States. 
  In the course of his visit to the Belgian capital the head 
of 
the Russian Federation's foreign policy department also plans to 
sign the framework document of NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
program and the "Russia-NATO" protocol to the eponymous 
bilateral cooperation program. 
  This protocol determines, the minister continued, that 
Russia 
and NATO will cooperate in the military-political and 
military-technical sphere on the main elements of the program 
which has already been submitted to Brussels by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, A. Kozyrev 
stated that this question will also be discussed at the meeting 
with W. Christopher. He announced that in Geneva in the near 
future there might be a second ministerial meeting which would 
be primarily devoted to liaison with the warring sides.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jun -- The Foreign Intelligence Service 
of the Russian Federation is closely monitoring the situation 
regarding the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and this 
monitoring is being done, among other things, in collaboration 
with representatives of Western special services, experts of the 
Foreign Intelligence Service told the ITAR-TASS correspondent 
today. 
  Replying to a question about the possible emergence of a new 
armed conflict on the Korean peninsula just over four decades 
since the end of the Korean war, the Russian special service 
experts said: For the time being, according to our estimates, 
neither side wants a conflict. The specialists said that so far 
they cannot see that either side has a clear and firm policy 
toward casting the world into global conflict. 
  The experts of the Foreign Intelligence Service 
categorically 
denied speculation that the former Soviet Union virtually 
assisted North Korea [DPRK] to create a nuclear bomb, stressing 
that cooperation between the USSR and DPRK in the nuclear field 
had been carried out for exclusively peaceful ends and under 
international control. In particular some work to train 
specialists was carried out. Apart from this, the USSR supplied 
fuel assemblies for a civilian research reactor under the 
control of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Commenting on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, 
informed Russian circles note that in addition to the problem on 
the surface, each side has its own political objectives and this 
is reflected in the political campaign now under way in the 
world.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Specialists from the Russian 
Ministry for Nuclear Power Engineering are sure that North Korea 
does not have nuclear arms, head of the ministry's department 
Georgiy Kaurov told a news conference here today. At the same 
time, he stressed that every state that has a nuclear reactor is 
potentially able to make an A-bomb. 
  The North Korean nuclear center was created with the use of 
technical documents and the assistance of Soviet nuclear 
specialists, Vladislav Kotlov, the ministry's leading expert and 
supervisor of the North Korean center's construction, told the 
news conference. 
  In his words, the center is meant for exclusively economic 
and scientific purposes, it produces isotopes for medicine and 
industry, processes the results of physical experiments, 
develops technologies and trains specialists. Today the center 
does not have a single Russian specialist. 
  "Any nuclear installation is capable to produce plutonium", 
said Kotlov. But it is necessary to build a number of 
facilities, train specialists and have kilos of plutonium to use 
the installation for the defence. 
  The expert said that North Korea is building the facilities 
and has nuclear specialists. But it has produced several dozens 
or hundreds of grams of plutonium which is not enough to make a 
nuclear bomb, he added. 
  In his turn, Kaurov thinks that one cannot say the nuclear 
arms are ready before they are tested. It is up to a sovereign 
state whether or not to admit IAEA inspectors to its secret 
facilities. Russia also has a number of centers which foreign 
specialists are not allowed to visit, he added.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev fears North Korea may soon get its own A-bomb and 
said the issue is of "a principle importance for Russia and the 
United States". 
  "Evidently, North Korea has no nuclear bomb at present, but 
it can be created in the near future. The production of a 
nuclear bomb is no problem for a centralised economy which has a 
plutonium- producing nuclear reactor", he told Russian mass 
media chiefs on Tuesday. 
  "If we close our eyes on the North Korean attempts to get 
nuclear weapons, this would serve as an example for other states 
with a nuclear potential", Kozyrev said and mentioned South 
Korea and Japan, in particular. 
  "It is known that the West resorts to hidden sanctions 
against such countries as it happened with Ukraine during the 
signing of a cooperation agreement with the European Union", he 
said. 
  The Russian foreign minister made it understood that the 
recent tensions in Russian-US diplomatic relations which emerged 
after Washington, contrary to bilateral agreements, distributed 
its unilateral UN Security Council draft resolution on sanctions 
against Pyongyang, have been eliminated. 
  He said Russia and the United States have begun to draft a 
completely new joint document which will be ready by Wednesday 
or Thursday. 
  Kozyrev also said that his US counterpart had forwarded a 
detailed outline of the report of former US President James 
Carter who had met the North Korean president.

  [Text] The Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy is concerned 
about the possibility of creating nuclear weapons in North Korea 
and other countries, Head of the Ministry's Public Relations 
Department Georgiy Kaurov told a press conference in Moscow. 
North Korea has no nuclear weapons today, he said. But every 
country possessing a nuclear reactor can create a nuclear bomb, 
he added. 
  He announced that any reactor can produce plutonium which 
may 
be used for creating a nuclear bomb. However, a nuclear bomb 
cannot be made without a radiochemical laboratory. North Korea 
will finish the construction of such a laboratory in 1996, he 
said. 
  He stated that not a single specialist possessing 
information 
about methods of creating nuclear weapons has left or will leave 
Russia. There are no Russian nuclear physicists in North Korea, 
he said. 
  The Ministry's leading specialist in atomic energy Vladislav 
Kotlov said that conclusions about the amount of accumulated 
plutonium might be made indirectly, without an inspection. One 
can assert that North Korea has nuclear weapons only after 
tests, he said. He believes that the amount of plutonium 
accumulated in North Korea is measured in grams and is 
insufficient for creating nuclear weapons. 
  He thinks that nuclear weapons in North Korea are a 
political 
issue and that some would like to overly exaggerate it. "All 
this is coming from South Korea and Japan, whose position is 
supported by the U.S.," he said. 
  Kotlov, who ran the construction of the North Korean nuclear 
complex, said that the construction got underway in 1963 and 
that two years later a water-type nuclear reactor was put into 
service. 
  The North Korean nuclear complex was intended for the 
production of isotopes for medical and industrial purposes, and 
for carrying out experiments. The North Korean reactor's 
capacity was 2000 kilowatt when it was put into operation, he 
said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kutakhov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 20 Jun -- The number of visits paid by U.S. 
nuclear submarines to ports on the west coast of Japan has 
increased during the last 12 months. Japanese naval sources 
quoted by KYODO news agency today believe that this is connected 
with the increased tension over the DPRK's nuclear program and 
the belief that Pyongyang is striving to create its own nuclear 
weapons. 
  The reason for the increased activity of U.S. nuclear 
submarines is the intensification of the U.S. Navy's 
intelligence operations around North Korea. The nuclear 
submarines are cruising along the DPRK coastline, picking up 
information about the communications networks of the North 
Korean armed forces and intercepting all kinds of radio messages. 
  The largest number of visits were to the U.S. naval base of 
White Beach on the Japanese island of Okinawa. Submarines 
called there 17 times. Moreover, U.S. nuclear submarines were 
also frequent "guests" at the docks of Sasebo (Nagasaki 
Prefecture) and Yokosuka (Kanagawa Prefecture) naval bases.

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts: "Korean Peninsula: </F>
Is the Crisis Over?"] 
  [Text] "It is my personal opinion that the crisis is over, 
and I am confident that Kim Il-song wants to ensure that the 
crisis is surmounted," Jimmy Carter, former U.S. president, 
declared after a conversation with Lake, the incumbent 
President's assistant for national security affairs, and 
Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
politico-military affairs. It was Carter who assumed the 
mission of intermediary between Pyongyang and the world 
community after the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  His unprecedented eight-hour conversation with Kim Il-song, 
the DPRK leader, resulted in Pyongyang's proposals for settling 
the crisis, which Carter took to Seoul and Washington. We are 
talking, in particular, of a proposal to reduce the troops of 
each of the Korean states by 100,000 men. The DPRK seems to be 
abandoning its former demands for the unconditional withdrawal 
of U.S. troops from South Korea and would now like their 
numerical strength to be reduced in the same proportion as the 
troops of the North and the South. In agreeing to a meeting 
with the South Korean president, Kim Il-song would like 
Washington to act as intermediary if the DPRK fails to find a 
common language with South Korea. 
  Finally, the chief point. Kim Il-song, according to Carter, 
will agree to freeze his nuclear program while "conscientious 
talks" are under way, and has promised not to remove the IAEA 
inspectors from the nuclear installation and to maintain in 
working order the monitoring equipment installed there. In 
return he would like to receive international assistance in 
making the full switch from a graphite reactor to a light-water 
reactor. 
  Official Washington has not gone into raptures over these 
proposals. It has been declared that the United States will not 
cease its efforts to introduce sanctions against the DPRK until 
real progress has been made on the nuclear problem. According 
to Gallucci, Pyongyang's fulfillment of a number of conditions 
remains the key point. Above all, its pledge not to process 
nuclear fuel, as well as permission for international 
inspections of DPRK nuclear installations. If these demands are 
met, Washington will agree to holding a third round of talks 
with the DPRK. 
  Despite the emphasized restraint, a sigh of relief is 
clearly 
audible in all this. For, as the mutual threats escalated, the 
situation was getting increasingly out of control. Many people 
were losing their nerve. Witness the Japanese prime minister's 
strange statement, to say the least, that his country possesses 
everything necessary to create nuclear weapons! Yet the idea of 
sanctions was clearly on the skids owing to the position of 
China and, partly, of Russia, which reckoned (not without 
grounds, as we see) that far from all means of persuasion had 
been used. President Clinton was finding himself in a rather 
foolish situation: Having raised his hand, he clearly could not 
strike. This cannot pass without hurting the reputation of a 
world leader. 
  The situation is still not entirely clear, and it is too 
soon 
to sum up results. But if the DPRK now permits inspections and, 
simultaneously, achieves the realization of even some of its 
proposals, then Pyongyang will be the obvious winner. If we 
forget about the high moral ground, then the North Korean 
politicians have played their game brilliantly. After 
escalating the situation to the limit, they have promised to 
sacrifice their nuclear program in exchange for de facto 
recognition of the DPRK. You can be confident that it will not 
even occur to anybody in the next few years to put pressure on 
North Korea over human rights observance or anything else. In 
politicians' brains it is being imprinted: Do not touch the 
DPRK, and nothing will threaten the nonproliferation treaty. 
  Pyongyang is not being original in this. It has played the 
game which Soviet diplomacy also played repeatedly and with 
success in unforgettable times. The object of the deal here is 
not nuclear might. The chief thing here is unpredictability in 
the eyes of the other people in the game. It seems that even 
now that the Cold War has vanished into the past it is possible 
to sell your own unpredictability quite well....

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: correspondents Igor </F>
Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry believes that if Iraq 
formally declared respect for Kuwait's sovereignty and 
recognized the demarcated frontier, the chances of lifting the 
international sanctions against Baghdad would look brighter, a 
senior Russian diplomat told an Interfax interviewer on Tuesday. 
  He stressed that these sanctions could not last forever and 
would have to be dropped sooner or later best of all by 
civilized means. 
  In his words, "even now there is an explicit erosion of the 
sanctions." "For instance, there is evidence of the Turks 
siphoning oil from the oil pipe-line, going from Iraq. In other 
words, an appropriate process is underway, and the world 
community should take it under control," he said. 
  He argues that the UN Security Council should set a 
six-month 
term for monitoring Iraq's compliance with the Security 
Council's resolution. "Even now one can say that Baghdad has 
fulfilled the UN Security Council's resolution 687 on 
disarmament in full. After this term, the UN Security Council 
could discuss the possibility of lifting or softening the 
sanctions. The Security Council imposed them, and it was for it 
to abolish them," the diplomat stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Livio Caputo </F>
by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent Aleksey Khazov in Rome "especially 
for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI;" date not given: "Italian Diplomacy: 
Thoughts on Naples and Moscow"] 
  [Text] It did not prove very hard to get an interview with 
Livio Caputo, new Italian deputy foreign minister. Partly 
because that is the new style which has already been established 
in the Berlusconi government, and partly because Caputo is a 
former journalist colleague. We became acquainted at a time 
when he was chief of the international edition of the Milan 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA and, coming to Moscow, managed to get what 
was at that time an international "scoop" -- an hour-long 
interview with Yegor Ligachev. 
  Caputo is 60 years old. He is married with three children, 
speaks five languages fluently, and has an indomitable passion 
for sailing (he participated in the first round-the-world event 
in 1973). He has a long journalistic and writing career behind 
him (he won the Hemingway Prize for his reports from war-torn 
Kuwait and has written three books devoted to Italian domestic 
politics, one of them significantly entitled The 
Downtrodden Citizen [Bednyaga-grazhdanin]). He is one of 
the "new people" who have come to the fore of Italian politics 
on the wave of the Forza Italia movement, which has proclaimed 
that its aim is to fight total irresponsibility and corruption. 
Already the new deputy minister, who is responsible for Italy's 
European affairs, has at least two successful diplomatic 
operations to his credit -- the Cairo talks which made it 
possible to secure the votes of "nonaligned" needed for Italy's 
admission to the UN Security Council 1 January next year, and 
the signing of a treaty on partnership between the European 
Union [EU] and Ukraine. 
  And so to our interview. 
  [Khazov] Today, on the eve of the summit meeting in Naples 
and President Yeltsin's visit to Italy, what in general terms is 
the Berlusconi government's attitude toward the new Russia? 
  [Caputo] To us, Russia is a great power which, in tackling 
difficult problems, is striving to find equilibrium and trying 
to transform a command economy into a market economy and 
simultaneously take its proper place in the changed world. This 
place must correspond to both its historical traditions and its 
status as a nuclear power. 
  [Khazov] Does official Rome support Russia's admission to 
the G-7 or does it support the option which commentators have 
dubbed "G-7 and a half," where Moscow is cast in the role of the 
"half"? 
  [Caputo] We advocate Russia's admission to the G-7 Political 
Directorate. At the same time we believe that the conditions 
for your country's full participation in this formation, where 
the economic factor is overriding, have objectively not yet come 
about. 
  [Khazov] What are these conditions? 
  [Caputo] Above all a sufficient level of market relations, 
currency convertibility and its known stability, and 
competitiveness of industry beyond the bounds of customs 
barriers, that is to say, full compliance with all the 
requirements made of G-7 participants. This, of course, is not 
only Italy's opinion, it is the opinion of all G-7 members 
without exception. 
  [Khazov] Is it possible to talk of the Berlusconi cabinet's 
continuity of "Russian" policy? 
  [Caputo] Of course, there are no radical changes of course 
and there cannot be any. I would mention as a new element only 
our government's constant attention to the process of 
liberalizing the Russian market, which would make your economy 
more comparable to Western ones. Let us put it this way: 
Compared with our predecessors we are trying to monitor Russian 
economic growth trends more seriously. 
  [Khazov] Some observers are trying to define the degree of 
Russia's "potential danger" to the Western world and to 
Europe.... 
  [Caputo] We believe that no danger exists as long as the 
current Russian leadership keeps firm hold of the reins of 
government. Yes indeed, we observed Russian diplomacy's first 
moves in the Bosnian crisis with some concern, but then we 
appreciated the possible "domestic" nature of this position and 
thereafter welcomed Russia's mediation. In my view this 
mediation made it possible to secure from the Serbs something 
the West would never have secured with its threats. Let us hope 
that Moscow's desire to cooperate will prevail over the logic of 
old alliances founded on religious and ethnic factors. 
  [Khazov] Consequently, can it be assumed that Rome, with its 
interests in the Balkans and Mediterranean, will be developing 
special contacts with Moscow regarding this region? 
  [Caputo] As regards cooperation, this is already taking 
place in addition to that through official channels. But it 
must be borne in mind that Italy is a member of NATO and the EU. 
Therefore it is obliged to synchronize with its allies its 
actions in relation to Russia. It is also important that our 
bilateral relations are developed outside the "umbrella" of 
coordinated policy, especially in the economic, trade, and 
cultural spheres. From this viewpoint we are mainly hoping for 
the very rapid modernization of Russian legislation regulating 
the attraction of foreign investment and favoring the activity 
of joint enterprises. Without a solution to the problem's legal 
aspect the Russian market's potential may never materialize in 
the way that it merits. 
  [Khazov] How are relations between Italy and other CIS 
countries developing? 
  [Caputo] Only yesterday in Luxembourg I and President 
Kravchuk put our signatures to the treaty on partnership between 
the EU and Ukraine. It is identical to the one we are shortly 
to sign with Russia in Corfu. Our relations with Moscow and 
other CIS capitals will be developed on parallel courses. As 
objective opportunities occur, partnership agreements will, I 
hope, be concluded with each of them. In the light of specific 
local characteristics, naturally: Thus, in the case of Ukraine 
the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power station is an 
important factor. But we have no bias toward anyone. 
  [Khazov] The slogan of the Forza Italia movement, which won 
an unqualified victory in the recent elections to the European 
Parliament, was the call: "Italy must mean more in Europe!" 
What are the ways of achieving this? 
  [Caputo] First, we want to be more vigorous in protecting 
our interests in the EU, where our partners, displaying better 
organizational capabilities, have encroached on them time and 
again. Second, we want to have greater weight in the "contact 
committee" for solving the Bosnian crisis. Finally, our 
membership of the UN Security Council, which we have just 
practically secured for ourselves, will be of great importance 
as regards putting the slogan into practice. 
  [Khazov] What does the Naples summit mean for the Berlusconi 
government? 
  [Caputo] Oh, it will be trial by combat. We hope that 
Naples will give the whole world a chance to see for itself that 
the new Berlusconi government knows full well what it wants, 
that it is not a "danger" to the West's stability, as the 
left-wing press has tried to prove, and finally that it can 
worthily represent Italy's interests at the highest echelons of 
world politics.

Aleksey Golyayev: "We Cannot Live Without One Another. Viktor

  [Excerpt] Milan, 20 June -- [passage omitted] 
"Two-and-a-half years of reforms have not been wasted," the 
Russian premier stated. "I can say with complete confidence 
that the foundations of economic recovery have been laid and the 
first signs of changes for the better have already started to 
appear. We have achieved steady results through our moderately 
tough financial policy. The inflation rate has been halved, 
during the period February through May it held steady at 8-10 
percent, and by the end of the year we have set ourselves the 
task of smoothly reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 percent a 
month." 
  The head of the Russian Government announced that in 1995 
the 
country will introduce a new tax system which will be clearer 
and more comprehensible to investors. "It is not impossible, 
however, that we will be able to achieve a significant easing of 
the tax burden in the second half of next year," V. Chernomyrdin 
said, "and right now we are preparing a package of decisions to 
attract foreign investments. In addition to easing the tax 
regime and the mechanisms for granting government guarantees, 
these also comprise a number of legislative acts regulating the 
procedures for concluding contracts on concessions and the 
division of output, and also acts designed to stimulate activity 
by foreign investors in 'free economic zones' on Russian 
territory." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin instructed the government not to wait until a border 
agreement is signed with Estonia and to demarcate the frontier 
by December 31, 1994. 
  "I resolve, before signing a Russian-Estonian border treaty, 
to unilaterally mark the Estonian section of the Russian state 
border where it existed on the moment when the Russian 
Federation recognised the sovereingty of the Estonian Republic 
on August 24, 1991," said the decree received by TASS on Tuesday. 
  The decision was adopted "to protect Russian political and 
economic interests" and also because "of the negative attitude" 
of Estonia to bilateral demarcation of the border. 
  Estonia claims some bordering Russian territories.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS news analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- It is precisely the border 
problems with Estonia, which lays claims to part of Russian 
territory, that prompted Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
unilaterally to define Russia's state border on terrain by a 
decree, dated June 21, pending the conclusion on a 
Russo-Estonian border treaty, Major-General Aleksey Kolesnikov, 
deputy commander-in-chief of Russia's frontier forces, told 
ITAR-TASS in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. 
  Unfortunately, Estonia is dragging out talks on a joint 
description and designation of the border on terrain in 
accordance with the universally accepted international practice. 
This brings about difficulties in the protection of Russian 
borders. The guarding of borders cannot be exercised if they 
are not clearly defined, Kozhevnikov said. 
  As is known, Estonia claims part of Narva district in 
Leningrad region and Pechora district in Pskov region. This is 
a territory with an area of 2,300 square kilometers. 
Nationalist-minded Estonian organisations have repeatedly 
attempted to set up road barriers on Russia's territory, thereby 
asserting "a new Russo- Estonian border." Various assemblies 
and congresses periodically demand that the "historical lands" 
be handed back to the Estonian side. The president of Russia 
said a firm "no" to attempts at arbitrarily changing the 
established borders. 
  Meanwhile the situation in the border sector remains 
complex. 
Attempts to cross the border unlawfully or to smuggle contraband 
merchandise, including arms and narcotics, continue unabated. 
  Russian border guards counter the criminals' challenge by 
adroit arrangements for guard duty and by enhanced cooperation 
with the customs personnel and law enforcement agencies. 
  Operations to identify smuggling channels prove resultative. 
This is evidenced by tens of firearms, hundreds of kilogrammes 
of narcotics, tonnes of non-ferrous metals, fuel, and art 
treasures that are intercepted at the border every month. 
  The accommodation of troops remains a painful problem with 
the border guards. In the opinion of the deputy 
commander-in-chief, personnel withdrawn from the Baltics had to 
begin accommodation arrangements practically from scratch. 
Estonia did not assign funds for that, although the withdrawn 
personnel left behind durable buildings and facilities, valuable 
radar and searchlight equipment, obstructions systems and many 
other things worth billions of roubles. 
  The Baltic district was among the Soviet Union's best 
accommodated ones. All this remains the subject of the talks 
but there are no constructive solutions so far, General 
Kozhevnikov said. 
  As Boris Yeltsin stated when addressing border guards on the 
eve of their professional holiday, "Russia favours the 
development of good-neighbourly relations with Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia and wider cooperation with them. But 
these states are not members of the CIS. Therefore the border 
regime should be sound and the guarding of the border should be 
organised accordingly."

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic conducted by Sergey Sidorov </F>
in Moscow; date not given: "There Are Forces which Regard 
Stability in the Balkans as Disadvantageous, According to 
Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic"] 
  [Text] Radovan Karadzic is the president of the Serb 
Republic -- a state proclaimed on part of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina after its declaration of independence without 
the Serb community's agreement. Under this former Yugoslav 
republic's constitution all questions with a republic-wide 
dimension were to be tackled solely on the basis of consensus 
among the three Bosnian communities -- Serbs, Muslims, and 
Croats. 
  Karadzic is a psychiatrist by profession. He is also a poet 
and a winner of the Sholokhov literary prize. 
  [Sidorov] Mr. Karadzic, during more than two years of war in 
Bosnia talks to end it have been held in various dimensions, as 
it were. Many prominent politicians, including Western figures, 
even claim that the international community's more active 
intervention has merely prolonged the war and increased the 
suffering of innocent people. What is your forecast: Will the 
plan proposed by the Washington contact group mark a decisive 
step toward peace or will the next round of discussions about 
peace end in a renewed escalation of the war? 
  [Karadzic] I do consider that the international community is 
largely to blame for the unleashing of this war. And if that 
community or, more precisely, the United States decides that it 
is time to end it, then a solution acceptable to the Serb side 
will not fail to emerge. If, however, they decide that it is 
not yet time and that the war should continue, they will propose 
a remedy that spells catastrophe for the Serbs in Bosnia. In 
that case the war will continue, and the Serbs will appear to be 
to blame. We have, alas, had to contend with just such a 
technique of interference. 
  During my present visit to Moscow I have been able to see 
for 
myself yet again that Russia sincerely wants stability in the 
Balkans and is ready to support us in our striving for peace. 
If the United States built its relations with the Muslim side 
in the same way, there would already be peace in Bosnia. But 
the Americans are urging the Muslims to seize the greater part 
of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are encouraging 
the Muslim leadership in its ambitions and its desire to 
dominate in the Balkans. This means in effect continuing this 
exhausting war. A war by one side to secure an Islamic 
bridgehead in Europe, while on our side it is a war for 
survival.... 
  [Sidorov] How are relations shaping up inside the 
Croat-Muslim Federation, created through U.S. mediation? Does 
it have any prospects? 
  [Karadzic] We do not think it has any serious prospects. 
The deep-rooted conflicts between the Muslims and the Catholic 
Croats constitute a separate and pretty extensive topic. The 
Americans have restored the Croat-Muslim alliance not so much to 
reconcile the Croats and the Muslims, who have fought each other 
over the last year, as to recreate an anti-Serb front. I am, 
unfortunately, forced to say that some American circles are 
openly working for war. The war is now in their hands, and they 
refuse to let peace and stability prevail in the Balkans.... 
  [Sidorov] Tell me, have you come to that standpoint 
recently or have you held it since the start of the war? 
  [Karadzic] We had our suspicions. But over time we became 
convinced of the following: As soon as the sides came close to 
a common solution, the Americans, who had started to pretend 
that they wholly supported the Muslims, would enter the "game." 
And that would prompt the Muslims to continue the war. 
  [Sidorov] If that is so, what, in your view, might be the 
next step by the United States on this plane? 
  [Karadzic] As I have already said, an attempt to impose 
terms unacceptable -- absolutely unacceptable -- to the Serbs. 
If the United States does actually want peace, then at least 
half of its initiatives will be acceptable to us and half not. 
Let the terms be equally disadvantageous to the Muslims and to 
us. 
  [Sidorov] As far as I recall, the Washington contact group's 
plan, that is to say the division of territory between the Serb 
community and the Croat-Muslim Federation in a 49:51 ratio, does 
not suit the Serb side, as you hold 70 percent of the territory. 
  [Karadzic] That formula does indeed fail to suit us because 
prior to the war 64 percent of the territory belonged to Serbs. 
We did not start the war and we have not lost it either. Why, 
then, should the Serbs have less territory after the war than 
before? Yet we are ready to surrender something in the interests 
of peace. We will surrender the 10 percent of the territory 
which is not ours. We are holding on to it at the moment in the 
interests of defense. But we are also ready to surrender Serb 
land provided there is peace. To break the deadlock we could 
even accept the 49:51 formula provided that an exchange of 
territory -- quality for quantity -- subsequently took place. 
  [Sidorov] Does that mean that it is far from being a matter 
of numbers and percentages? 
  [Karadzic] It is not just a matter of them. Discussion 
should also proceed in terms of the viability of the states 
formed in place of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, 
the conditions for viability are important not just for the 
Croat-Muslim state but also for ours. After all, if the 
international community were to accept the arguments of one side 
and ignore those of the other, that would be an obvious 
injustice. Our terms are as follows: the mouth of the Una 
river, a sufficiently wide corridor in the Posavina, and the 
rejection of any border along the Drina river, which was a 
symbol of the Serbs' separation (half the Serbs were in the 
Austro-Hungarian empire and half in Serbia). In addition, we 
need our part of Sarajevo and access to the sea. 
  [Sidorov] But you know that these terms are regarded as 
unacceptable by the Muslim side. 
  [Karadzic] No, I consider that if they were in favor of 
peace they would accept these terms, as they pose no threat to 
the security of their state. 
  [Sidorov] How do you now rate the state of contacts with 
Moscow? 
  [Karadzic] We feel that Russia -- particularly the people -- 
understands us. The government is in a difficult position. 
Russia cannot afford to get into conflict with the West, but we 
do not want that either. For us Moscow's objectivity is the 
main thing. The Russian government really can play the role of 
mediator, as it understands both us and the Muslims. 
Unfortunately, the United States demonstrates a different 
approach. 
  We have no right to ask Russia to intercede in everything, 
but it is in Russia's own interests to see that the Serbs always 
have been and remain the country's most consistent allies in the 
Balkans. And we are, after all, now paying the price for our 
traditional friendship with Russia. By dividing the Serb people 
and weakening their state system the West has always sought to 
weaken Russia in some hypothetical conflict. The double 
standards which Western countries and Turkey are demonstrating 
in Balkan affairs -- in their assessments, say, of the actions 
of the Croat-Muslim and Serb sides -- cannot be explained any 
other way. 
  [Sidorov] What do you think of the intentions of your 
opponents -- the leaders of the Muslim community? Do you 
concede that they are sincere in their desire for peace for 
their own people? 
  [Karadzic] We are convinced, unfortunately, that our 
opponents are essentially not seeking peace. These are 
politicians of a fundamentalist, pro-Iranian persuasion. They 
have already promised their coreligionists in Sudan and Iran 
that they will take all of Bosnia-Herzegovina under their 
control and become a member of the Islamic Conference. This 
despite the fact that there are fewer Muslims than Christians in 
Bosnia.... Not so long ago Nijaz Durakovic, former leader of 
the Bosnian Communists, said that the Bosnian Muslims would be 
the best terrorists among the Islamic revolutionaries because 
they look like Europeans. Alija Izetbegovic expressed himself 
in similar vein a few days ago. 
  I have to say that we are facing the first threat of Islamic 
fundamentalism in Europe -- the first but not the last. 
Europeans' heads will continue to ache from what has happened 
in Bosnia.

  [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation between 
the Russian Federation and the European Union (EU) is 
practically ready for signing. On June 23 after the document is 
coordinated in all ten languages of the contracting parties, it 
will be initialled by the heads of the delegations participating 
in the talks, the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic 
Relations told Interfax. 
  The signing ceremony will take place in the Church of Saint 
George on the Greek island of Corfu on June 24 at 10:00 in the 
morning. The agreement will be signed by the Russian president 
and the EU leadership. 
  Deputy Chief of the Department of Multilateral Cooperation 
under the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations Maksim 
Medvedkov stressed that it had taken two years of tense talks to 
complete the agreement. 
  For instance, the unwillingness of the EU to improve the 
conditions for Russian goods entering its markets was quite a 
problem. Discord concerning export of Russian uranium and 
activities of EU banks in Russia also hampered the talks. 
  The present talks helped to resolve these issues in general. 
  The agreement provides for mutual application of the basic 
principles of GATT in trade with certain exception made for 
nuclear materials on which a separate agreement will be 
concluded by 1997. 
  A total of five EU banks which were given authorization for 
operations with Russian residents but failing to use it due to a 
presidential decree restricting activities of foreign banks 
issued in November, 1993, will be given their rights back. 
  In what concerns other banks, during the period of 
transition 
Russia will keep the right to apply to them certain restrictions 
defined by the agreement. In particular, the agreement said 
that the share of foreign capital in the banking system of 
Russia must not exceed 12 pct. The restrictions also concern 
the number of branches of foreign banks and their right for 
operations with residents. 
  Medvedkov stressed that the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Russia and the EU provided for gradual 
integration of the Russian economy with the single European 
economic space. The principles used within the scope of the EU 
for the free movement of goods, capital and services and of 
establishment of companies and their activities, will be step by 
step implemented in the countries which have joined the 
agreement. 
  The EU is the biggest economic partner for Russia. The share 
of the trade turnover with the EU is 35 pct of Russia's trade 
turnover with the far abroad. The share of the EU in Russian 
export is 36 pct.

Grigoriy Serebryanikov. 
  He noted that along with Zhirinovskiy, several other members 
of the lower house of parliament also intend to make the trip. 
  According to Serebryanikov, Zhirinovskiy sent U.S President 
Clinton a letter which informed that a plane with Russian 
parliamentarians would land in Baghdad, at the Iraqi capital's 
airport. Serebryanikov explained that this was done so that a 
desire to "shoot down the airplane" does not creep up on the 
Americans.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
is ready and can help exports of Russian goods to the world 
market, however, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations does 
not help the Foreign Ministry in this respect, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev told a meeting of editors-in-chief of 
Russian mass media bodies here today. 
  That is why, the Foreign Ministry does not even know what 
state is the most efficient economic partner for Russia, he 
added. 
  In the words of Andrey Kozyrev, a single state strategy for 
Russian entrance to the world market has not been elaborated 
since the time of Eduard Shevardnadze was Soviet foreign 
minister. "If we receive a corresponding concept from the 
minister of foreign economic relations, we could act in the 
Russian economic interests. Politics always influences the 
economy," said Kozyrev.

  [Text] Russia and China ended talks in Moscow on Tuesday by 
signing an agreement for cooperation in the area of 
communications. 
  The two sides are committed to help improve their 
communications networks and postal services, ensure the transit 
of all types of communications and postal dispatches through 
each other's territory and provide better legal regulation. 
  Russia and China are planning to increase the number of 
telecommunication links from 30 to 90 by the end of this year 
and largely reduce the need for third countries in this sphere, 
Russian Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak told reporters 
in Moscow. The number of links, telephone and other, will 
eventually be increased to 250 to meet the two countries' needs, 
he said. 
  The two countries reaffirmed the intention to let Beijing 
hook up to Russia's transiberian fiber optic communications due 
to go into operation in 1996. For its part, China is to install 
communications from Harbin to Khabarovsk and Nakhodka and from 
Heihe to Blagoveshensk.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 21 Jun -- The Russian-U.S. exercises 
ended today on the shores of Slavyanskiy Bay in southern 
Maritime Kray. Marine subunits from the Russian Pacific Fleet 
and from the crew of the American amphibious vessel Dubuque, 
which has been visiting the Far East, participated in the 
exercises. 
  Two columns of "amphibians" landing from the Russian and 
U.S. 
vessels met precisely at midday at a crossroads that led to a 
previously prepared training ground. After receiving orders 
from the command point, they marched rapidly to the training 
site, where, according to a plan developed by representatives of 
the Pacific Fleet headquarters and the Dubuque command, it was 
necessary to immediately clear up the consequences of a 
hypothetical earthquake. 
  In the "natural disaster" area, which lay in ruins, a 
support 
group was already at work and equipment was being used. 
Powerful machines that had been carried off the vessels started 
moving the rubble and putting out fires. A flow of the "dead" 
and "injured" started arriving at the evacuation points, where 
they were put on helicopters and immediately taken to hospitals. 
  But the most interesting and exciting moment was the landing 
of the assault force. A stormy wind and waves created serious 
obstacles for the assault force, but the Russian armed vehicles 
and the U.S. amphibious vehicles carried out the assault across 
the water barrier and easily "captured" the prescribed area of 
land. Their reward was praise from the leaders of the exercises: 
Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov, deputy commander of the Pacific 
Fleet, and David Baze, brigadier general of the U.S. Navy [name 
and title as received]. 
  Both sides believe it is necessary to regularly carry out 
exercises like these on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, both in 
Russia and in the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Manki Ponomarev: "Bill Clinton: The Armed </F>
Forces Will Be Provided With Everything"] 
  [Text] Not so long ago I wrote about U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's statement during an international television linkup in 
which he outlined the three main components of his foreign 
policy to many millions of viewers. Then the head of the White 
House placed in first place the postulate that U.S. military 
strength must be maintained "at the proper level." 
  Clinton reaffirmed his adherence to this postulate at a 
meeting with the crew of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier 
George Washington. The President reminded the sailors listening 
to him that, despite the ending of the Cold War, there are still 
numerous sources of military threat in the world. "We have to 
resolve tasks which remain complex," he said, "maybe not 
opposing armies which threaten our existence but defending our 
security and expanding the boundaries of blessed freedom." 
  In setting the armed forces tasks, the leader of the 
Washington administration emphasized that it is very important 
for the United States to support its military-industrial 
complex, "because to this day it defends the security of the 
greatest nation in the history of the world." Therefore, as 
President, he is full of "immutable, absolute" determination to 
provide servicemen with everything they require to efficiently 
fulfill their mission. "You deserve this," Bill Clinton 
declared, addressing the entire personnel of the U.S. Armed 
Forces from on board the aircraft carrier. "We need your 
devotion to the cause. We need your talent."

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- Most Russian retired military 
living in the Baltic states are elderly people and pose no 
threat to the security of the countries, according to Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev who also said that the fact is 
clearly understood by the Baltic leaderships who, however, 
"remain hostages of the political situation". 
  80 per cent of the pensioners are over 60. "They have 
nowhere 
to leave and pose no threat to the national security. Besides, 
they receive pensions from the Russian Defence Ministry", 
Kozyrev told Russian mass media chiefs on Tuesday. 
  "Leaders of the Baltic republics are intelligent people and 
clearly realise that the problem is artificial. However, they 
remain hostages of the political situation", Kozyrev said and 
added that he is pessimistic about an early solution of the 
problem of Russian retired military living in Estonia. 
  The main Russian task is that "military pensioners in the 
Baltics are not offended and humiliated", the minister stressed.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- UNESCO Director-General 
Federico Mayor began his visit to Moscow with talks with Russian 
minister of science and technology and head of the Russian 
commission of UNESCO Affairs Boris Saltykov. During his first 
working day, the UNESCO chief is also scheduled to meet 
patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Aleksiy II, mayor of Moscow 
Yuriy Luzhkov and Russian mass media officials. 
  Federico Mayor is a leading Spanish scientist and 
biochemist. 
He has written over 50 scientific works, member of several 
academies, and a noted political worker. Mayor has been at the 
helm of the prestigious specialized organization in the U.N. 
system for the past more than six years. UNESCO helps 
strengthen peace, security and cooperation among the people in 
the field of education, science and culture. 
  Before beginning his current visit to Russia, in an 
interview 
with ITAR-TASS, Federico Mayor emphasised that he would like to 
see closer interaction between the two sides in the 
reconstruction and modernization of the Hermitage museum in St. 
Petersburg, and the Russian state library and the Bolshoy 
theatre complex in Moscow. 
  Favouring everyday contacts with Russia, Mayor intends to 
take part in the opening ceremony of a UNESCO bureau in the 
Russian capital. According to him, the international 
organization can make use of Russia's experience in its own 
activities. 
  The UNESCO director-general is expected to be received by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Wednesday.

scientific and cultural elite held today at the Russian Ministry 
for Science and Technical Policy aimed to give a fresh impetus 
to the UNESCO-Russian efforts in education, culture and science 
and discuss cooperation in communications. 
  The UNESCO director-general is currently in Russia on an 
official visit to receive a people's friendship order from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and attend the opening ceremony

secondary education and the Russian intellectual contribution to 
international projects. Mayor stressed that the Russian 
intellectual potential cannot be called into question. UNESCO 
and Russia will hold the second world congress on information 
science and education in 1996. 
  Upon the negotiations completion Federico Mayor and Rector 
of 
the Russian State Institute for International Relations Anatoliy 
Torkunov signed an agreement to create a human rights department 
at the institute. 
  Federico Mayor told ITAR-TASS that three years ago they 
signed a memorandum on interaction to confirm bilateral 
cooperation in education, science, culture and communications. 
Then three major projects were outlined. The first one was 
related to the support to the Bolshoy theatre, the second 
concerned the state library, and the third concerned the 
Petersburg hermitage. At the same time, UNESCO would like to 
develop close relations with the Russian scientific community. 
  Today the sides discussed the results of bilateral efforts 
within the past year on all the three projects. 
  UNESCO has allocated 500,000 U.S. dollars to finance various 
Russian projects, including the activities of research centers, 
schools and programs of Russian-language studies.

Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Boris Gromov had 
a meeting today with representatives of the sub-committee for 
disarmament and arms control of the FRG Bundestag. Questions of 
arms reduction -- primarily nuclear and chemical -- in Europe 
were discussed. This process is important and essential but 
every one of us is worried lest it become a one-way street. 
Might it not end up with us, alone, destroying our arsenal, 
while the West actively assists us, leaving its own untouched? 
  [Begin Gromov recording] Parity in disarmament is maintained 
in line with signed agreements and treaties. We, naturally, 
could not have a situation where we would sign a treaty 
concerning, for example, the elimination of chemical weapons, 
that was detrimental to us and our defense capability. [end

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Toward Economic Union"] </F>
  [Text] A routine meeting has taken place in Kiev between 
delegations from the Russian and Ukrainian Unions of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, led by the presidents of these 
unions, Arkadiy Volskiy and Leonid Kuchma. Though directors of 
industrial enterprises and production companies participated in 
it, it definitely had a direct bearing on agriculture. After 
all, the severance of economic ties between Russia and Ukraine 
also hit rural areas hard. 
  As we know, when the USSR collapsed, production of row-crop 
tractors remained in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] while 
production of grain-harvesting combines remained in Russia. 
What is more, the "Rostselmash" plant receives diesel engines 
from Kharkov. As a result the slightest failure in the delivery 
of parts from Russia to the Kharkov "Serp i Molot" plant may 
lead to its shutdown, and this will disrupt the production of 
grain-harvesting combines, which in turn may disrupt 
agricultural work in Ukraine. Russia will also have a hard time. 
  The meeting's participants came to the unanimous decision 
that the only way out of the present situation is to form an 
effective economic union. They adopted an Appeal to the 
Presidents, Parliaments, and Governments of Ukraine and Russia 
containing a demand to do everything in their power to create 
appropriate conditions of economic integration between the two 
countries. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who received Arkadiy 
Volskiy and Leonid Kuchma, was familiarized with the document.

  [Text] In an interview with INTERFAX a high-ranking officer 
of the Russian Navy Staff commented on the proposal of the 
speaker of the Ukrainian parliament Aleksandr Moroz to set up a 
joint command of Russian and Ukrainian fleets in the Black Sea 
and said it requires serious clarification. 
  If NATO is used as a model, Moscow could closely study, for 
instance, the appointment of a supreme commander of naval forces 
in the Black Sea who would be an operational commander of both 
fleets, the officer said. He added that in this case the 
supreme commander would be appointed by Russia. 
  In his opinion another option is also possible: the 
operational subordination of the Ukrainian navy to the Black Sea 
Fleet. 
  Earlier Ukraine had insisted on the approval of a supreme 
commander by the presidents of the two countries. The commander 
was supposed to have one deputy from Ukraine and another from 
Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak: "First </F>
Russian-German Exercise in History Held Abeam Ruegen Island"] 
  [Text] When fire broke out on board a German missile fast 
attack craft and the crew were unable to cope with it on their 
own, the commander of the Hermelin put out an SOS. In a matter 
of minutes the Baltic Fleet's patrol combatant Neustrashimyy 
sent its own emergency rescue party to fight the fire, and it at 
once began localizing the flames. At the same time the Russian 
patrol combatant's lookout noticed someone floundering in the 
waves not far from the German craft. Captain Second Rank Igor 
Ryzhkov, commander of the Neustrashimyy, sent up a rescue 
helicopter piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Petrov. From 
on board the helicopter Majors Anatoliy Lysenko and Andrey 
Goncharov lowered rescue paramedic Ensign Vasiliy Yakubovskiy, 
who returned to the helicopter with a drowning German sailor 
("This was the happiest day of my life," Seaman Wolfgang 
Weitsaecker would later remark). It took the helicopter crew 
just 38 seconds to rescue the drowning man. 
  In the evening, on board the Westerwald, the base for the 
German missile fast attack craft, where the first day of the 
exercises was being analyzed, the Hermelin's commander made the 
following comment on that episode: "We must learn from the 
Russian helicopter pilots." I am sorry to say that at that 
moment I thought the German commander was flattering us. But I 
had to abandon that thought the very next day. Spending five 
hours on board the German missile fast attack craft Hyaene, I 
saw for myself the skill of the German sailors and the fact that 
at sea they work flat out. If they assess their own work and 
that of others, then they do not cast their words to the wind. 
  For example, a Sea King helicopter was lifting Western 
journalists off a fast attack craft traveling at 12 knots: 12 
takeoffs in 15 minutes. Or take this breathtaking sight: An 
attack aircraft was in a screaming dive against a missile fast 
attack craft moving at 33 knots. Just when the Tornadoes [as 
published] seemed ready to hit the target, the attack craft 
executed an abrupt antiaircraft maneuver.... 
  Eleven ships and several aircraft took part in the first 
bilateral naval exercise in the Baltic in the history of Russia 
and Germany. On the German side were new missile fast attack 
craft and modern minesweepers. The Russian Navy was represented 
by the patrol combatant Neustrashimyy, the Baltic Fleet's latest 
ship. 
  "In these exercises we had three goals," Rear Admiral Hans 
Lyussov [name as published], chief of staff of the German Navy, 
told KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's correspondent. "The first goal is 
political -- to demonstrate to our population joint work. The 
second goal is military, since we are military people -- to 
jointly rehearse tasks in a regime of full trust. The third 
goal is to learn from each other. All three of these tasks have 
been successfully fulfilled." 
  Vice Adm. Viktor Litvinov, deputy commander of the Baltic 
Fleet and the senior officer in the exercises on the Russian 
side, in turn confirmed: "These 48 hours of exercises were 
useful to both sides. We have gotten to know each other 
better...." 
  Of course, as in anything new, problems could not be 
avoided. 
Before my eyes a glitch occurred during the exercise in the work 
of the Neustrashimyy's primary control station: The watch 
officer was unable to decode a signal transmitted from the 
German missile fast attack craft Puma. It turned out that the 
command was being transmitted according to the NATO signal code, 
which, naturally, is not used on Russian warships. Therefore 
special bilateral signals will be used in the future when 
holding other Russian-German exercises. 
  I do not know what conclusions politicians will draw from 
this naval exercise, but the sailors' conclusions are obvious: 
At sea it is important to be friends.

  [Text] Speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament 
Ivan Rybkin and the deputy chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet Vyacheslav Kuznetsov spoke for closer unity between their 
two countries in Moscow on Tuesday. Kuznetsov is convinced that 
with time "we are going to advance from the Commonwealth of 
Independent States to a union of independent states" setting up 
a super-national body with coordinating and controlling powers. 
  In his opinion no matter who is going to be elected 
Belarusian president on Thursday the parliament will firmly 
pursue a policy of economic integration between independent 
states. 
  At the present stage Ivan Rybkin finds it necessary to work 
for unified, standardized legislation for CIS countries in order 
to ease integration. He is convinced that the experience of 
unified Europe, its common bodies and conforming legislation 
should be used. 
  Rybkin said that last week the Duma supported the idea of a 
parliamentary meeting of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine to discuss 
the results of the 1991 agreement on the formation of the CIS. 
"The evaluation of the situation should be realistic so that 
our future steps can be adequate," Rybkin declared. 
  On July 5 the Duma committee for CIS affairs will hold 
hearings on the same subject. Rybkin invited Belarusian 
counterparts to attend. 
  In return the Belarusian side invited Russian MPs to take 
part in festivities on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of 
Belarus on July 3.

"specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI" under "Contacts" rubric: 
"Time To Stake Claims. What Russian Parliamentarians Became 
Convinced of in Latin America"] 
  [Text] Russia is ready for partnership relations with 
South America. Convincing the Latin Americans of this was the 
main task of a Federation Council delegation's official visit to 
Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador. 
  The purpose of creating a political climate in Latin America 
favorable to Russia is meant to facilitate the development of 
mutually advantageous economic and trade relations between our 
countries. The great potential of the region, which occupies 13 
percent of the globe's land mass with a population of around 450 
million people, the complementarity of our economies, and the 
similarity of our economic and sociopolitical processes are 
preconditions for this. All the leaders of the countries that 
the delegation visited spoke of the need to organize strategic 
collaboration with Russia. The Brazilian president, for 
example, noted that "this is needed to prevent the creation of a 
unipolar world." The Brazilians let it be clearly known that it 
is time for Russia to "stake its claims" in Latin America. 
Unless it lays a long-term basis for Russian-Latin American 
relations, the region's leading countries will quite soon "reach 
the peak of the world hierarchy without taking Russian 
priorities along with them." 
  Meetings with representatives of Latin American countries' 
business circles demonstrated their readiness to cooperate with 
Russia primarily in the sphere of private enterprise. Here they 
stressed the importance of the "sponsorship" of future projects 
by presidents, foreign ministries, and other official state 
authorities. The Russian side also believes that relations in 
the private sector can to some extent compensate for the 
transitional difficulties in foreign economic ties with Latin 
America associated with the crisis in the previous model of the 
Russian economy. 
  In order to facilitate these contacts there must be a 
renewal 
of the legal and treaty base of relations with Latin American 
countries. Treaties have already been concluded with a number 
of them, and memorandums have been adopted on the principles of 
bilateral cooperation. Draft agreements on protecting 
investment and avoiding double taxation are being elaborated 
with many of them. These questions have been repeatedly raised 
at meetings between the Russian delegation and their Latin 
American colleagues and entrepreneurs. They are very important 
as regards developing trade and increasing the volume of 
investment in the Russian economy. 
  The Latin American market is also fruitful for Russia from 
the viewpoint of high technology. Venezuela has great 
experience in the sphere of oil extraction and refining, and it 
is recommissioning once-abandoned wells by using the latest 
technologies. Brazil is ready to cooperate with us in the 
aerospace and nuclear power generating spheres. 
  Finally, we must not forget Peru, Nicaragua, and Cuba -- 
Russia's debtors. We must seek a settlement in relations with 
these countries in order to recover the people's billions: 
These countries' total debt is estimated at over $20 billion. 
  The changes that have taken place in the world are forcing 
Russia to look at the former Third World in a different way. 
The countries of this vast region in the Western Hemisphere 
will no longer be an arena for rivalry between the 
"superpowers." At any rate, for as long as a democratic Russia 
exists.

  [Text] St. Petersburg June 21 TASS -- Russian governors 
will "insist on a soonest meeting with President Boris Yeltsin" 
to tell him about their opinion of ways out of the economic 
crisis, Leningrad Regional Governor Aleksandr Belyakov told 
ITAR-TASS today upon the completion of a governors' meeting in 
Novgorod. 
  "The president meets anyone but us, and we know the Russian 
life from inside," said Belyakov. In his words, the governors 
have elaborated 23 measures which, they believe, will help to 
overcome the economic crisis and they want to tell the president 
about that immediately. 
  The governors give a priority to the 10,000,000,000,000 
ruble 
emission to make the ruble/dollar correlation real and settle 
the non-payment problem a reason for which is the enterprises' 
lack of proceeds they have earned. 
  Anti-crisis proposals also include the introduction of a 
modern bill mechanism, state insurance of loans to the 
population, state control over the increased cost of energy 
carriers and cargo transportation, subordination of all federal 
structures in regions to the municipal authorities and the 
introduction of the governor status in Russia.

  [Text] Groznyy may demand the restoration of the USSR if 
Moscow keeps saying the Chechen republic is part of Russia, a 
member of President Dzhokhar Dudayev's staff told Interfax. 
According to the same source the former Soviet leaders would be 
invited to Groznyy for consultations on the issue. 
  A senior presidential spokesman said the Chechen leaders 
recognized the legitimacy and legal acts of only the Soviet 
Union. "As for the legitimacy of the Belovezh agreements that 
caused the USSR to fall apart, the Chechen leaders have big 
doubts about them", the source told Interfax. "The Chechen 
people have the full right to this, because when for the first 
time in their history they took part in the referendum on 
preserving the USSR, they voted "yes"." 
  "If Russia, which does not have a legal reason for 
statements 
that Chechnya is a member of the Russian Federation, keeps 
saying so, Groznyy will reserve the right to call in question 
the legitimacy of the Russian Federation and its leaders", the 
senior source at the Chechen presidential staff said.

"Dudayev Ready To Meet With Yeltsin in Person. People's 
Diplomacy As Means of Solving Interethnic Conflicts"] 
  [Text] Shmidt Dzoblayev, general secretary of the Assembly 
of North Caucasus Democratic Forces, told journalists yesterday 
about his experience of shuttle diplomacy in establishing 
contacts between Chechen Republic President Dzhokhar Dudayev and 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, he 
was visited Chechnya 13-15 June to hold talks with the 
republic's top officials, including President Dzhokhar Dudayev. 
Shmidt Dzoblayev said that Dzhokhar Dudayev is ready for 
personal talks with Boris Yeltsin, but he insisted that the 
meeting be held without mediators, meaning the State Committee 
for Nationalities Policy, which was earlier headed and is 
currently supervised by Sergey Shakhray, "the enemy of the 
Chechen people," and also the President's Administration for 
Work With Territories, where Doka Zavgayev, former first 
secretary of the Chechen-Ingush Communist Party organization, 
currently holds a job. The Chechen president's proposals were 
passed by Mr. Dzoblayev to Boris Yeltsin through Sergey Filatov 
and Georgiy Satarov. According to Mr. Dzoblayev, the Chechen 
president counts on Boris Yeltsin's goodwill despite "the 
unwillingness of certain forces in Russia to reach accord." Mr. 
Dzoblayev assured journalists that Chechnya wants to have 
treaty-based relations with the Russian Federation. 
  Unfortunately, the leader of the North Caucasus democratic 
forces could not shed light on how precisely the Chechen 
Republic is going to straighten out its relations with Russia -- 
whether this will be an agreement between two independent states 
or whether it will be modeled on the treaty between the Russian 
Federation and Tatarstan. However, Mr. Dzoblayev said, the 
Chechnya leaders plan to request guarantees that the republic's 
citizens be granted immunity from political reprisals by the 
Russian authorities; in addition, Chechnya fully supports the 
idea of creating "a CIS defense shield." He noted in particular 
that according to high-ranking Chechen officials, Dzhokhar 
Dudayev "sees himself as a Russian officer and is proud of it." 
  As for the geopolitical situation in the region, Mr. 
Dzoblayev pointed out that many people are concerned by attempts 
to squeeze Russia out of the Caucasus, something in which 
Britain is taking a particularly active part, Chechen Republic 
leaders think. In addition, Shmidt Dzoblayev expressed his 
regret that the leaders of the North Caucasus republics meet 
with each other only with Moscow's mediation. 
  Apparently in order to prop up "state diplomacy" Shmidt 
Dzoblayev and his colleagues are planning to set up 25 June an 
Assembly of National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of Russia, 
which will include various public and political organizations 
from the republics within the Russian Federation, the Russian 
Movement for Democratic Reform, and also the Assembly of North 
Caucasus Democratic Forces. In Mr. Dzoblayev's words, the new 
organization's activity may become a new level of people's 
diplomacy aimed at settling interethnic disputes.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Dudnikov report: "Time To Join Forces"] </F>
  [Text] An agreement was signed a few days ago on long-term 
cooperation between two components of the Russian Federation -- 
Khanty-Mansiysk and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs. They 
guarantee "to offer each other a shoulder to lean on" both in 
the economic sphere and in the utilization of financial, 
material, natural, personnel, and other resources. The two 
okrugs intend to unite their scientific-technical and 
information potential in conditions of the emergence of a market 
economy. 
  Given that the okrugs of Yamalo-Nenets and Khanty-Mansiysk 
are main suppliers of oil and gas in Russia, the agreement will 
allow them to bring the question to the government's attention 
on a more fundamental basis in the interests of the territories.

<F P=106> [Valeriya Ochinyan report: "Urals Opposition Association. </F>
Union of Workers and Peasants Intends To Restore Soviets"] 
  [Text] A Union of Workers, Peasants, and Working 
Intelligentsia has been created in Yekaterinburg, the Russian 
president's home town. The existence of such an organization in 
the Urals, where all processes connected with economic change 
proceed more painfully than anywhere else, could have a serious 
influence on the political situation in the region. Yesterday's 
sitting of the Coordination Council of this organization was 
attended by a visitor from Moscow -- Oleg Shenin, chairman of 
the UCP [Union of Communist Parties]-CPSU. 
  The Union has been joined by the local branches of the 
Russian Communist Workers Party, the "Worker" association, the 
"Russian Union" national-patriotic association, the 
Agro-Industrial Complex trade union, and the teachers strike 
committee. The communists hope they will soon be joined by 
local members of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. While 
the Union was created way back in early 1993, the question of 
its official registration appeared to its leaders "untimely" 
until recently. However, the opposition's success in the 
December elections and the activization of the opposition forces 
in Moscow urged the Urals' leftists to emerge from "hiding." 
The arrival of Oleg Shenin seems also to be intended to 
underline the importance of the coming registration of the Union 
and its reliable connections with Moscow comrades. 
  Despite the fact that the Union is a rather mixed bag, its 
members, the organizers are convinced, have common goals and 
only "insignificant differences" on tactics. Their immediate 
demands to the Federal Assembly and the government seem rather 
traditional: modify the tax system, provide state protection for 
commodity producers and a broader state protection system for 
the working people, ensure timely payment of wages. The Union 
conscientiously stresses economic demands -- they are more 
readily understood by the ordinary voter. The organization's 
only political task is to restore the soviets as "government of 
the people." At the same time, the organizers state, their 
Union is no opponent of reforms "with the exception of those 
that infringe on the interests of the working people." 
  Entrepreneurs and bankers in the Urals have virtually 
ignored 
the consolidation of the communist and socialist forces. Maybe 
this is explained by the local elite's rather firm confidence in 
their power and their ability to prevent activization of the 
leftists. At the same time, it is possible, by expertly 
directing their consolidated forces, to bring pressure to bear 
on the federal authorities and the rich Moscow commercial 
structures which are increasingly infiltrating the industrial 
Urals.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from </F>
Severodvinsk by Valeriy Anuchin] 
  [Text] To date around 100 nuclear submarines have been 
withdrawn from service in the Russian Navy. More than 10 very 
outdated submarines have accumulated at a division for 
dismantling submarines at the White Sea Naval Base in the 
roadstead of Severodvinsk port. Some of them have been there 
for more than 15 years, waiting to be dismantled. Yet not even 
the fuel from their nuclear reactors has been unloaded yet. 
There is simply nowhere to put it. Nuclear waste storage 
facilities in Murmansk and Severodvinsk are full to capacity. 
Because of the Northern Fleet's lack of money, the dismantling 
of the reactors and subsequent storage of the nuclear waste have 
been postponed for many years. Meanwhile considerable sums of 
money are having to be spent to keep these submarines afloat. 
  [V.P. Shempelev, White Sea Naval Base chief of radiological, 
chemical, and biological defense] These submarines have been in 
service for a great many years and there is therefore a 
potential danger that the radiation situation will deteriorate. 
So painstaking ecological monitoring of the radiation situation 
in the area where these submarines are located is essential. 
  [Anuchin] But how are the White Sea Naval Base specialists 
of to carry out such monitoring when the Akademik Vavilov -- the 
only vessel in the North equipped for monitoring radiation and 
ecological safety -- is being withdrawn by its owner, the 
"Krasnoye Sormovo" shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod, despite the 
fact that the Northern Fleet is prepared to sign a long-term 
lease?

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General V.S. Chechevatov, commander </F>
of the Far East Military District, by Valeriy Usoltsev under 
"Military Commander Takes the Floor" rubric; place and date not 
given: "They Will Not Be `Toy Soldiers'"] 
  [Text] Col. Gen. Viktor Stepanovich Chechevatov, commander 
of the Far East Military District, is a man of indisputable 
authority for the region's Cossacks. They consider him "one of 
their own." And it is perhaps now understandable why the Cossack 
hetmans of Russia's remote regions elected him unanimously as 
their appointed hetman. 
  [Usoltsev] Viktor Stepanovich, many politicians of the most 
diverse caliber and rank are today wooing the Cossacks and 
seeking to win their favor, that is to say, to attain the sort 
of position in which you now find yourself, enjoying their love, 
esteem, and respect.... What do you think is moving these 
politicians toward the Cossacks? 
  [Chechevatov] Well, you have come up with a whole "bunch" of 
questions. So, am I to analyze, on the basis of my own 
experience, the goals of people who, I suppose, are using the 
Cossacks simply to attain their own interests, for their own 
political advantage? My experience is not suitable. I am with 
the Cossacks with all my soul, with all my heart. They are such 
radiant people, just what our Fatherland needs today! They are 
a force. That is why these people are trying to get attached to 
them. They represent the special spiritual world order of our 
excellent national "mix." And to "toy" with the Cossacks today, 
to "woo" them, is to destroy -- to deliberately destroy, I 
believe -- the green shoots of our national recovery. These 
people want to use them -- but for destructive purposes. But 
the Cossacks.... They are an open people, they frequently trust 
those who by no means take them where they need to go, where our 
Russia itself needs to go.... 
  So much "dirt," so much "trash" has swamped the Cossacks 
today; there are so many "masqueraders" in their midst. 
"Masqueraders" not only on the outside but on the inside too, 
people whose very thoughts are pernicious.... 
  But there is virtually no opposition to all these deceitful, 
false, alien elements among the Cossacks, it seems to me. I 
often say this to the Cossacks at meetings. After all, this 
compromises the entire movement and provokes distrust in it on 
the part of outsiders. At best, that is -- if such an 
expression is appropriate. At worst, it provokes caustic 
mockery and downright insults. 
  But I believe that, nevertheless, the Cossacks will not let 
anyone else get their grubby hands on their banners, their 
martial glory. 
  The other day I returned from an official trip along the 
Amur 
and the Ussuri. I visited the Cossack villages. Traditions are 
alive and well. And traditions are like the roots of a tree. 
If there are roots, they will "pump in" the strength of the 
earth, and therefore, everything else will be there too. 
  Hereditary Cossacks have appeared here once again. 
Kalmykovs, Nazarovs, Poluyanovs, Byankins. They know how to 
teach good sense to the Cossack "young," how to kindle love for 
the Motherland in their hearts, how to develop in them a sense 
of Duty, Honor, and military self-sacrifice in the name of the 
land in which they were born. 
  And the Cossack villages themselves? It is like finding 
yourself in another world. Take Mogilevka, for example. The 
Cossacks, able in mind and body, live and create there. Their 
homes are beautiful to look at; there is always a good harvest; 
there is no despondency, and people believe in tomorrow. 
Therefore they actually prepare this tomorrow themselves, 
without relying on anyone else to do it for them. You know, 
after a meeting with such a people you feel a real spiritual 
uplift, the world seems a brighter place. 
  Anyway, it seems that the district commander has started to 
gush. And this is contraindicated for us military people, as 
one of Aleksandr Kuprin's heroes remarked. Well? Time to talk 
about Cossack soldiers? 
  [Usoltsev] You mean the creation of Cossack subunits in the 
district? 
  [Chechevatov] There you have just used the term "subunit." 
Some Cossacks and hetmans are offended if we use this word, and 
not "combined formation," say, or "unit," at a pinch. They say 
that it is humiliating. We, they say, are ready today to put 
forward corps and armies. You are not ready, I reply. Why 
start to compromise a good thing? And again, what kind of new 
game of "gigantomania" is this? Your first steps do not have to 
be painful strides; just stretching your foot forward will do. 
And who needs cripples? Not all of them understand jokes, they 
take offense.... As a rule, it is not those who think about the 
task in hand itself who think in terms of "corps," but those who 
think about themselves in that task. About being on show, being 
a prominent figure. In general, of course, many people have 
appeared today who wish to take command of "corps," to shine in 
generals' shoulder boards; for some Cossacks, as I notice, have 
a pretty simple attitude toward ranks: If it's what you like, 
it's yours by right, so help yourself. 
  However, all this has been said before. 
  My opinion is that the time has come to begin serious work 
on 
a program of military training for young Cossacks "at local 
level," in their native villages. After all, what happened in 
the past? The Cossack came into the services already with a 
sufficient degree of professional training. 
  We have already started to do one or two things in this 
area. 
In a number of Cossack villages classes in military science are 
being given under the leadership of hetmans, with the aid of 
retired officers and sergeants. The district command is making 
available its own training grounds and firing ranges and 
allocating weapons and ammunition for these purposes. Many 
serving officers are also involved with young Cossacks and are 
training replenishments for themselves. As a rule this takes 
place on nonworking days, in off-duty periods -- in their 
personal time, as we say. This is truly selfless devotion. It 
turns out that, despite everything, real officers have not died 
out in our country. 
  Today Cossacks living along the border already know where 
they have to go in the event of a deterioration of the situation 
or the emergence of a threat to Russia, where to get their arms, 
and at what gun emplacement to perform their combat task. 
  We have started to use Cossacks to guard military stores and 
other Army facilities. By the way, the security and defense of 
Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy Ostrov has already been entrusted to 
Cossacks. A Cossack company has been formed there, and young 
Cossacks are serving creditably. 
  As district commander I would like to mention the best men 
by 
name. They are all "hereditary villagers": Privates Aleksandr 
Chernyshov, Konstantin Mamontov, Vladimir Ivanov, Sergey 
Petaltsev. 
  The district command sees the Cossacks as a real military 
force, as their reliable reserve. And of course, we will not 
leave them to confront problems alone. 
  [Usoltsev] Cossacks complain of the lack of uniforms and 
equipment. All this costs a lot of money these days. And where 
are horses to be had? Can the district help here? 
  [Chechevatov] We will help the Cossacks with uniforms and 
equipment. Rest assured that we are taking this question off 
the agenda. 
  As for horses, the reviving villages have begun to raise 
them 
themselves. In the aforementioned Mogilevka. Back when he was 
a sovkhoz director the current hetman, Vladimir Torkhov, founded 
a stud farm on his own land and built a hippodrome, attracting 
dozens of young men and women to equestrian sports. It was from 
here that for the first time in the region, and perhaps in the 
old Soviet Union as a whole, young men began to come to serve in 
the Border Troops with their own horses. Yes, all problems are 
being resolved. If, of course, there is a desire to resolve 
them. If there are people who dream of making Russia great, of 
training for it a new generation of true sons and reliable 
defenders of their native borders. 
  These will not be "toy soldiers." These troops will be the 
pride of our Armed Forces. 
  This is my belief.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has addressed 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, proposing to set up a 
Russian-Ukrainian oil company as a transnational corporation. 
The proposal was made after Kravchuk's visit to Lugansk's 
Lisichansk Petroleum Organic Synthesis joint stock company. He 
believes that setting up a transnational corporation would be 
another step along the path of strengthening friendship and 
developing cooperation between Ukraine and the Russian 
Federation. 
  The president of Ukraine familiarized himself with the state 
of affairs at the joint stock company. At a meeting with the 
enterprise's leadership, work force, and specialists, the 
prospects for the development of the oil processing sector and 
ways of curbing its economic crisis were discussed. 
  On the same day, Kravchuk met representatives of labor 
collectives, local authorities, parties, and movements from the 
towns of Lisichansk, Rubezhnoye, Pervomaysk, as well as 
(?Kalininskiy) and some other rayons of Lugansk Oblast. He 
described the economic situation in Ukraine, spoke about his 
vision for resolving current problems, and answered numerous 
questions from the electorate. 
  Participants in the meeting expressed themselves in support 
of the president's course and praised his plans of further 
nation building.

between Ukraine and Russia. However, in reality there is no 
free trade. This was stated by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Oleksandr Makarenko at a Ukrainian Foreign Ministry briefing. 
He explained that there were 48 exceptions to the list of

sources and timber, are vital to us. 
  The deputy minister believes that setting up a CIS economic 
union, and Ukraine being an associate member of this union,

  [Text] Kiev -- UNIAN learned today that Ukraine's Ministry 
of the Environment has agreed technical requirements for a 
system of radiation monitoring in Ukraine. The requirements 
were worked out by the British company PA Consulting Group, in 
accordance with the EEC program of technical assistance to the 
CIS (TACIS). They were agreed following expert appraisal by 
Ukrainian departments involved in radiation monitoring and 
accident control. 
  Kostyantyn Rudya, deputy head of the directorate for nuclear 
and radioactive safety of Ukraine's Ministry of Environment 
[name and title as received], told UNIAN that the agreement 
makes it possible to launch the first part of the Gamma-1 
monitoring system for nuclear power plants, which constitutes 
the first part of a radiation unit in Ukraine's environmental 
monitoring system which is being developed in coordination with 
the Ministry of Environment. According to Kostyantyn Rudya, the 
EEC wishes to receive immediate reports on radioactive accidents 
at Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station] which could 
have transboundary effects. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Environment, taking national interests 
into account, has attached additional conditions to the 
technical requirements submitted to the EEC mission in Ukraine. 
These include the widest possible use of Ukrainian equipment, 
services, and organizations by the Gamma-1 contractor. 
Ukraine's Ministry of Environment has also expressed an 
interest in Ukraine's participation in approving criteria for 
the choice of contractor in a competition to be held by the EEC.

  [Text] Sevastopol must become Ukraine's naval stronghold, 
while the Russian Navy can be deployed there as a navy of a 
foreign power, Ukrainian Navy Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy 
said. 
  Speaking in Sevastopol on Tuesday, he said Russia could be 
allowed to deploy its navy there for a period of 15 to 25 years 
after an appropriate leasing agreement was signed. 
  The commander hopes that the problem of sharing the Black 
Sea 
Fleet (BSF) will have been sorted out by the end of next year as 
envisaged by the Yalta agreement. 
  On Speaker of Parliament Alexander Moroz's call for joint 
BSF 
command to be maintained, Beskorovainy described the task as 
technically feasible. However, he stressed that the question 
was purely political amounting to the creation of a military 
alliance in fact. 
  Russia and Ukraine ended the final round of talks in Kiev on 
9 June by compiling a list of warships to be shared with each 
other. However, the question of deployment and sharing the 
existing infrastructures remains unresolved. 
  Beskorovainy also said that a Ukrainian patrol ship would be 
sent to France to take part in a final parade at Rouan early 
next month dedicated to fifty years since the allied nations' 
operation in Normandy.

  [Text] Oleksandr Makarenko, deputy minister of foreign 
affairs, spoke at a briefing at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry today 
on the results of President Leonid Kravchuk's visit to 
Luxembourg and the signing of an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union [EU]. The 
deputy minister described the agreement as the beginning of 
Ukraine's integration in the united Europe. He said, in 
particular, that for Ukraine the most important part of the 
document is the political part, which confirms the EU's interest 
in Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
integrity. Regarding purely economic issues, Oleksandr 
Makarenko said, the agreement envisages the withdrawal of any 
restrictions on trade between Ukraine and EU member states. He 
said, however, that although Europe, by this agreement, has 
opened its doors, the speed of our integration will depend on 
the speed of our reforms.

  [Text] Lvov 21 June TASS -- According to the UNIAN 
independent Ukrainian news agency, the Lugansk-based 
machine-building works set going production of cartridges for 
submachine guns and pistols, including those of calibre 7.62, 
which are in great demand by foreign customers. 
  For example, a Cambodian entrepreneur has ordered 10 million 
cartridges of this calibre; the Dutch have ordered even more -- 
50 million cartridges. 
  To retool the Lugansk-based plant as soon as possible, the 
"Ukrinmash" foreign trade company, which has a licence for 
selling this kind of production, proposed that 10-20 million 
cartridges (the so-called untouchable reserve) be taken from the 
depots of Ukrainian Defence Ministry and sold in the West. The 
Ukrainian Government has already given a go-ahead for the move.

<F P=106> [Pavel Lomakin report from the "Situation in Ukraine" </F>
column: "If Meshkov Did Not Exist, Kravchuk Would Have Invented 
Him"] 
  [Text] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has made a move 
that is rather surprising in the runup to the elections in 
Ukraine, which are so critical for him too. A very long move, 
at that: to Geneva, at the invitation and at the expense of the 
international nongovernmental organization Forum, thus giving 
rise to numerous rumors among his countrymen. 
  Supporters regard Meshkov's trip as a visit by a political 
leader recognized in the West, while gossip-hungry cynics see it 
as a trip to open a Swiss bank account. Be that as it may, 
Meshkov left with an easy mind: According to surveys, even 
though the Crimeans will go to the polls, in the majority of 
cases they will not vote for Leonid Kravchuk but for Leonid 
Kuchma. Generally, it is foolish to deny that Meshkov is an 
extraordinary figure on the CIS political stage. Public calm on 
the peninsula -- as well as relations between Simferopol and 
Kiev -- largely depends on him. The Crimean president's trip to 
Moscow and the inviting of metropolitan economists to Crimea are 
seen as his most successful moves. Yevgeniy Saburov assumed 
office virtually painlessly, which is more than can be said for 
his Moscow team. The Crimean Supreme Soviet in particular has 
started to drop broad hints that the president, by betting on 
the Muscovites, has fallen hostage to cabinet politics not 
formulated in Crimea, and it has begun to challenge Meshkov's 
edict-issuing powers. 
  True, the slogan "face to face with Russia" has not lost its 
attraction to the Crimeans. It is also significant that 
Kravchuk, who planned to visit the mutinous peninsula in the 
course of his election campaign, has not so far made up his 
mind. The friction between Simferopol and Kiev has brought 
dividends not only to Meshkov. Occasionally, he has acted too 
sharply, which in the absence of open support from Moscow only 
heightened passions in Kiev over Ukraine's territorial integrity 
and brought considerable political dividends to Kravchuk, 
custodian of the Constitution, both in the West and at home. 
  If preelection polls reflect the situation adequately and 
the 
majority of Crimeans and other Ukrainian voters vote for Kuchma, 
even then Meshkov's problems will not diminish. Because so far, 
political demarches come off better with him than economic 
solutions. Kuchma for his part -- even though, judging by his 
election statements, he advocates a union with Russia, on the 
one hand, and Crimea's sovereignty within Ukraine's borders on 
the other -- will hardly put up with sluggish reform. 
Furthermore, in this event Meshkov will most likely also have 
to revise some of the decisions made. For example, it is not 
clear how a constitution revived by the Supreme Soviet, 
restoring the independent Crimean Republic, will fit into the 
concept of state structure a la Kuchma. 
  Possibly, it was the uncertainty of the situation that 
forced 
Meshkov to leave his country at such a crucial moment. A month 
ago, during the Crimean president's trip to Cyprus, Kravchuk 
sanctioned an unexpected landing in Simferopol of top military 
brass and special task forces. This enabled Meshkov once more 
to show himself off as an independent leader. It is unlikely 
that anything like this will happen now (discounting Kravchuk's 
possible visit) but it is not ruled out that Kiev is provoking 
Meshkov to undertake another demarche.

  [Summary] Simferopol -- On 20 June presidential candidate 
Volodymyr Lanovyy visited Crimea where he met Viktor Mezhak, the 
deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council. He also took 
part in a meeting of the higher economic council, which was was 
formed on 19 June under the Crimean Supreme Council presidium. 
  In his speeches Volodymyr Lanovyy supported the idea of 
democracy and economic regionalization. In his view, it is 
necessary to give the regions the right of autonomy in budgetary 
and tax affairs. He supported the idea of private ownership of 
land, but in the form of shares in collective or cooperative 
farms. 
  Speaking about his economic program, Volodymyr Lanovyy said 
that the duties on exports and imports are very high and that he 
would abolish export duties. As regards import duties, he 
considered that it should be no higher than 5 percent. He also 
believes there should be no restrictions on trade with the 
exception of those on strategic goods.

  "I am against turning land into a commodity," said Oleksandr

war. This war over food will break out halfway between now and 
the doubling of the planet's population. The world will be ruled 
by those who will own fertile land. Fate has it that this 
wealth is now in the hands of the Ukrainian people. If we start 
trading land, we will wind up on foreign soil in our own 
country. This must never be allowed." 
  Answering a question by UNIAN, Oleksandr Moroz confirmed 
that 
he is "the only candidate who supports a parliamentary republic" 
and did not distance himself from the statement in a resolution 
issued by the plenum of the Ukraine Communist Party Central 
Committee that "president Moroz alone is able to rid Ukraine of 
the presidency." Also today, Oleksandr Moroz met representatives 
of the local labor collectives at Odessa State University, and 
servicemen at the district officers house. According to the 
program of his visit to Odessa oblast, the presidential 
candidate will meet farmers in the rayon center of Kominternove, 
after which he will travel on to meet voters in Rovno and Volyn 
oblasts.

<F P=106> ["Text" of the statement released by the Supreme Council </F>
press center in Kiev; date not given] 
  [Text] As is known, for the first time in history, 
Ukraine's Supreme Council on 15 June initiated and adopted basic 
principles and directions for developing the Ukrainian economy 
during the crisis period. A report on this topic was delivered 
by Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. 
  The legislative chairman paid a working visit last week to a 
number of Ukraine's oblasts and regions to clarify the 
principles of economic policy and the realistic, concrete steps 
for implementing these principles during the current stage. It 
is understandable that during a meeting with working collectives 
and citizens other issues were discussed, as well. In 
particular, Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz is being 
addressed as a candidate for the Ukrainian presidency. Certain 
organs of the media, however, while covering the working trip by 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, allow biased reports or 
insinuations to be filed, or sometimes simply produced outright 
provocative reports. Along these lines, the Moscow television 
company Ostankino made an unsubstantiated statement that 
Oleksandr Moroz had withdrawn his candidacy and refused to run 
for president. Alas, this provocative fabrication was picked up 
by other indiscriminating media, including some in Ukraine, 
which found themselves in an awkward position before the eyes 
and ears of their readers and listeners, having swallowed 
Ostankino's primitive bait. The Supreme Council press center is 
being addressed by the electors with demands to clarify the 
essence of these reports -- is this true? The press center is 
authorized to report that this so-called sensational report by 
the Ostankino television company is a vicious fabrication 
pursuing certain political goals. There were no reasons for the 
appearance of such a piece of reporting during either the 
meeting of Oleksandr Moroz with electors or the news conference. 
This is not the first time that Ostankino, in its reports from 
Ukraine, has released disinformation and twisted facts with the 
purpose of distorting the actual state of things, ignoring the 
truth -- one of the principal requirements of journalism. While 
covering such important official events as the working trip by 
the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman, every paper, every 
television or radio agency should be even more accurate and 
objective, and inform people only of the truth, not spread 
clearly provocative fabrications.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol by </F>
Svitlana Pysarenko in Kiev on 16 June: "Stabilization Is 
Possible in a Year or a Year and a Half"] 
  [Text] [Pysarenko] Vitaliy Andriyovych, will you form a 
new government before the presidential elections? 
  [Masol] Of course, we will form one; there should be a 
government. The government, in my opinion, will bring together 
competent, qualified specialists. 
  [Pysarenko] You said that the prime minister must head the 
Executive Branch... Are you convinced that the Supreme Council 
will adopt such amendments to the Constitution? 
  [Masol] The parliament will only be adopting amendments in 
September, after the run-off elections. 
  [Pysarenko] You said that a year or a year and a half is 
needed to achieve stabilization. Are you convinced that the 
people will suffer quietly during this period? 
  [Masol] I believe that today one must speak the truth: The 
situation will not improve overnight. People must understand 
that everything depends on the harvest. If it is good, 
stabilization will begin a little earlier. 
  [Pysarenko] Forgive me for asking this, perhaps, unpleasant 
question: Do you think that you were appointed prime minister 
as a symbol of 1990, or as a reformer? 
  [Masol] I would have to say the latter. 
  [Pysarenko] The press has reported that Masol is going to 
nationalize commercial banks. Is this true? 
  [Masol] The press is now free, and it writes whatever it 
wants. If someone is going to privatize commercial banks, then 
I would like to ask him: What will happen then; will we live 
with the old system of planning? I will not. 
  I want to note, however, that all over the world, states 
draft plans, have economy ministries, and make balance sheets 
and forecasts. A state must know what it needs and how much. 
  [Pysarenko] After answering deputies' questions, did you not 
have an impression that you are a better marketeer than they? 
  [Masol] You have already answered your own question. 
  [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward Russia? 
  [Masol] Russia is our primary market. If you can, please 
find a state which would buy 2-3 million tonnes of sugar from 
us. Yet, we should also cooperate with the West. The West 
means modern technology and structural reconstruction of our 
economy. Russia means energy resources and a market for our 
goods. We should sell our products. To buy something, one must 
sell something. These are normal economic relations, and 
whether we refer to them as a union or a market... We have yet 
to see. 
  [Pysarenko] Will you continue the policy of [former acting 
Prime Minister] Zvyahilskyy on not financing the budget sector? 
  [Masol] More than half of Ukraine's workers are employed in 
the budget sector. The budget sector is the nation's gene pool. 
If we want to lose it, we should not finance education, health 
care, or science. 
  [Pysarenko] To what degree will the cabinet be reshuffled? 
  [Masol] You know, I do not yet know how many people are in 
the cabinet... 
  [Pysarenko] Are you satisfied with the current form of 
cooperation between the government and the National Bank? 
  [Masol] The government, the Finance Ministry, and the 
National Bank should work together. Everything depends not on 
who is subordinated to whom, but on how they cooperate. 
  [Pysarenko] Who will be finance minister? 
  [Masol] I will think about it. 
  [Pysarenko] For whom will you vote in the presidential 
elections? 
  [Masol] For those who will be included in the polls... 
  [Pysarenko] What will be your policy toward the Crimea? 
  [Masol] Crimea is a part of Ukraine, it is Ukraine, and 
territorial integrity must be preserved. 
  [Pysarenko] Would you agree to lease Sevastopol to Russia? 
  [Masol] This issue as a whole needs attention. Still, there 
is such a practice in the world, and there is nothing new here. 
Kazakhstan has leased a launch-site to Russia, and it will 
profit from that. 
  [Pysarenko] What is your position on the idea of relations 
between Ukraine and the Crimea being based on treaties? 
  [Masol] If we have an integral territory, what kind of 
treaties can there be? 
  [Pysarenko] I wish you success and support in the reform 
process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian presidential candidate Leonid </F>
Kuchma by Stanislav Prokopchuk in Kiev; date not given: 
"`...And We Will Come Down Hard on the Mafia.' That Is What 
Ukrainian Presidential Candidate Leonid Kuchma Is Promising His 
Voters"] 
  [Text] When Leonid Kravchuk was asked whom he sees as his 
main rival in the upcoming 26 June presidential elections, his 
answer was unequivocal -- Kuchma. The "duel" in the second 
round will be with him, the present head of state believes. So, 
since we recently set out Leonid Kravchuk's election platform on 
the most important political and economic problems, we decided 
also to allow Leonid Kuchma to speak out. Our correspondent met 
with him. 
  Kiev -- [Prokopchuk] Leonid Danilovich, what direction is 
Ukraine going to take and what will it build if you become 
president? 
  [Kuchma] We will build a state in which someone who works 
honestly has a better life than someone who refuses to work and 
steals and pilfers from the state. Where a pensioner can live 
on his pension rather than eke out a pitiful existence and root 
around in trashcans. Where you can live a life worthy of a 
human being on the minimum wage. 
  [Prokopchuk] How do you see Ukraine's state structure, and 
what do you think of the idea of a federal land-based structure? 
  [Kuchma] I am a categorical supporter of strong presidential 
power so that the head of state can assume full responsibility. 
Initially, I even rule out the post of prime minister. I do not 
want the president to be able to point the finger at anyone and 
find a whipping boy and scapegoat. 
  As for the desire of the Dniester and Donbass regions for a 
kind of economic federalism, this is a matter not of a wish to 
escape pressure from the center but of its uselessness. It is 
little use today. The regions are surviving themselves 
nowadays, either on their own or by helping each other without 
intermediaries. The country's budget is practically empty. I 
was one of the first to advocate a future federal land-based 
structure and greater economic autonomy for the regions, but 
without this turning into political autonomy. That would spell 
the disintegration of statehood. I am opposed to that kind of 
structure. 
  [Prokopchuk] In one of your first speeches in parliament as 
head of government you made the sensational statement that mafia 
structures and corruption have permeated all upper-echelon power 
structures. But what stopped you during your year as head of 
the cabinet of ministers from seeing through to completion at 
least one major case about oil, say, or the sale of metal at 
dumping prices.... 
  [Kuchma] Why did I make that statement in the Supreme 
Council at that time? Because the problem of corruption and the 
mafia is a matter of personnel policy. Who is in charge of the 
power ministers? Not the prime minister, but directly the 
president. What about the courts and the prosecutor's office? 
Parliament is in charge of them. In this situation what can 
the premier do except refer cases to the prosecutor's office and 
make statements in parliament? 
  During my premiership over 1,500 criminal cases were 
instigated against high-ranking corrupt officials. Now they 
have all been quietly shelved. I personally dismissed the 
directors of all Ukraine's oil refineries for machinations over 
the export of petroleum products running into hundreds of 
millions of dollars. They now have their jobs back.... I give 
my word that if I win the election I will have both the powers 
and the determination to deal a mortal blow against crime and to 
come down hard on the mafia. 
  [Prokopchuk] What in your view is the way out of the 
Crimean crisis? 
  [Kuchma] Everyone must clearly realize that Crimea is a 
component part of Ukraine and proceed on this basis. There can 
be no question of other terms. Second, there should be no 
attempts to take back what has already been given away. The 
Crimeans are asking for greater economic autonomy -- fine. 
Maybe Crimea will indeed be the place where all economic 
innovations are tried out. There must be an end to 
saber-rattling and threats: We cannot allow yet another 
"trouble spot" to appear on the map of the former Union. But 
some people badly want this. The only possible way out of the 
Crimean crisis is a full-scale treaty between Kiev and 
Simferopol that would grant Crimea within Ukraine all possible 
economic autonomy. In my view the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan is a model for such a solution. 
  [Prokopchuk] What would be your way of extricating the 
country from the protracted economic crisis? 
  [Kuchma] First, privatization. It must take place under 
strict state control, as it does throughout the world. 
Otherwise this will only enrich the mafia structures that are 
tightly interwoven with the bureaucratic apparatus. The 
foundation of the economy must be not ideological phantoms, 
whatever their hue, but people's real interests. The experience 
of economic development of countries like the FRG and Sweden 
cogently demonstrates this in practice. 
  Second, the taxation system must immediately be 
fundamentally 
changed, since it stifles both private enterprise and state 
enterprises. In this connection the budget structure must also 
be radically revised, making a point of increasing the share of 
expenditure earmarked for the social sphere, science, education, 
and specifically for increasing pensions. After all, it is 
impossible to live on pensions today. 
  Third. There is a need to eliminate all restrictions on the 
creation of a single economic space in the CIS countries, which 
over 80 percent of industry is geared toward. This question is 
not just Leonid Kuchma's view but a matter of the survival of 
the entire state. And the fixed exchange rate of the 
karbovanets is totally disastrous for our economy and is merely 
a source of fabulous wealth for certain powers that be. Its 
abolition is a priority measure. 
  [Prokopchuk] All your election campaign opponents accuse 
Kuchma of dragging Ukraine into a new inviolable Union and say 
that if he comes to power Ukraine will lose its autonomy and 
sovereignty. How ideally do you see Ukraine's policy vis-a-vis 
Russia? 
  [Kuchma] Because of its geographical position, historical 
past, and the entire spirit of the people Ukraine cannot play 
the role of "cordon sanitaire" between Russia and the remaining 
European countries that has been foisted upon it. Its 
historical mission is very different: Ukraine must become a 
bridge for the mutual enrichment of the civilizations of West 
and East. A bridge across which the most sophisticated and 
vitally necessary technologies pass. 
  Russia, with which we are linked by thousands of historical, 
economic, and cultural bonds, is especially important in this 
respect. The path of confrontation with it is quite disastrous 
for Ukraine and entails total collapse and the possible loss of 
statehood. Relations of "special partnership" like those 
between the United States and Canada must inevitably be 
established between our countries. 
  Finally -- a few words about economic integration, not about 
Kuchma's desire to create a new version of the former Union. 
Integration is the basis of the current economic prosperity of 
the EEC countries. Integration, and not the subordination of 
one country to others, and the creation of regional 
organizations for all-around equal cooperation, as is being done 
in Europe and North America. The CIS must become a model not of 
"civilized divorce" but of the ability to preserve old economic, 
cultural, and spiritual links while adapting them in the light 
of objective conditions and to organize new links. 
  [Prokopchuk] So who do you think is going to win the 
upcoming elections? 
  [Kuchma] I am sure the people will make the correct choice 
26 June.... Demagoguery will no longer work, and the 
presidential candidates who have made it the basis of their 
activity have not got the slightest chance of winning.
