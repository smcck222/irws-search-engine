<F P=106> [Election address by presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma -- </F>
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed voters, I am very pleased to have the 
opportunity to speak to you again, to reflect, to set forth my 
views for the present and the future. After long reflection I 
decided to join on the difficult election campaign for the 
highest post -- that of president of Ukraine. I made this 
decision because I am deeply convinced that no one can stand 
aside when people are (?living in poverty). 
  I believe that the people of Ukraine deserve a better fate 
and a better life than what we have today. For now, the whole 
people have been forced to pay a terrible price for the 
incompetence and short-sightedness, the lack of will and refusal 
to work of those who governed the state for four years [words 
indistinct], talk, make promises, and turn entirely different 
things into reality. It is much easier to lay the blame on four 
consecutive governments. 
  Recently we have all witnessed the unprecedented propaganda 
campaign which has developed against me personally and against 
the political course for which I stand. These [word indistinct] 
are numerous accusations of antipatriotism, the desire to 
restore the Soviet Union, to give away Crimea and the Black Sea 
Fleet to Russia, anonymous falsehoods, plain lies, and an 
information blockade. 
  Why has there been so much of this? I will reply. Those who 
do this are simply afraid, they are afraid that they will have 
to answer for betraying the hopes of the people, for the 
collapse of the economy, for helping corruption and criminal 
structures, for the unprecedented impoverishment of the people. 
  So maybe it is time to think about it -- maybe the trouble 
is 
that the state does not have a master. 
  A few words about the present economic situation, which has 
become catastrophic in the last half-year, when Ukraine's 
industry practically came to a stop. Adventurism in the economy 
undoubtedly (?governs) [word indistinct] now. [passage omitted] 
The country, according to all economic laws, is on the verge of 
a catastrophe, and the people (?are without means) of existence. 
Believe me, it is painful to watch, when crime prevails 
everywhere, while honest people are unable to survive or feed 
their children. 
  I am certain that if the current economic and political 
course stays the same, even worse times and even greater ruin 
await Ukraine. I am convinced that order has to be brought to 
Ukraine, and that this can only be done when the individual and 
his rights are at the center of attention of all branches of 
power - legislative, executive, and judicial. All citizens (?of 
Ukraine have to feel) equal, irrespective of their nationality, 
religion, or position. I (?believe) and will endeavor for all 
to be equal in the eyes of the law, and for the law to be above 
all. 
  I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I, 
Leonid Kuchma, am ready to assume all responsibility for the 
state of affairs in the country, without looking for someone 
else to take over the burden of problems. 
  I am deeply convinced that Ukraine needs a new economic and 
political course. It will include a rejection of 
self-isolation, the restoration of all mutually advantageous 
economic, spiritual, and cultural links with the former 
republics of the Soviet Union, above all with Russia. In my 
opinion, Ukraine is not a cordon sanitaire between Europe and 
Russia. Ukraine is a [word indistinct] bridge between West and 
East. It is a country which should be open for cooperation 
[word indistinct]. Only then will new technologies and 
resources come here. Our state's future lies in using them. 
  But now the economy is a hostage to unwise policies. My aim 
has always been and will be for the economy to be above 
everything else. Because I am convinced that Ukraine will become 
a real state only when the economy starts working, when 
production starts to increase, when we create a powerful 
economic system. All conditions for this exist here. 
  How to do this? If I am elected president of Ukraine, I 
consider it necessary to restore, without interference by the 
state, the abruptly disrupted economic links, to create a single 
economic space with CIS countries on the model of the European 
Community or the American Free Trade Area. I consider it 
necessary to strive for Ukraine's full-fledged entry into the 
economic union and will speak in favor of all states signing a 
currency and customs agreement on equal terms. 
  Customs-houses and borders should record and monitor the 
movement of goods and protect our domestic market, but 
ill-thought out and irrational customs duties need to be 
eliminated. Retail prices will immediately go down, which every 
citizen of Ukraine will notice. 
  I think that in the economic sphere we need, above all, to 
conduct market reforms vigorously. Not reforms for the sake of 
reforms, but for the sake of the well-being of the people. 
Because otherwise they will be doomed to [word indistinct]. 
  If I am elected president, the taxation system will be 
reviewed and liberalized. Income should not be taxed, only 
profits should be taxed, as is the practice worldwide. The 
fixed exchange rate between the karbovanets and the dollar will 
be urgently eliminated. It destroys all of our exports and makes 
production loss-making. 
  Equal conditions for the existence of all forms of ownership 
will be ensured -- state, private, and collective ownership. 
The financial and banking spheres will be put in order. 
Permanent (?economic) regulations for the (?ruble zone) and 
Ukrainian enterprise will be created. 
  In the area of state-building I am in favor of granting as 
many rights as possible to the regions in resolving economic and 
cultural problems. This in particular will reliably guarantee 
Ukraine's territorial integrity and current borders. 
  I will strive to grant official status to the Russian 
language in Ukraine, with Ukrainian retaining the status of 
state language. (?We) believe that the situation whereby Russian 
has the rights of a foreign language here is not only a mistake, 
but a dangerous mistake. 
  I have never talked anywhere about restoring the Soviet 
Union, because a return to the past is impossible. But I will 
do everything so that Ukraine develops good-neighborly relations 
with all countries, especially with those with which we are 
linked by history, culture, and economy. 
  I want to emphasize that the course toward mutually 
advantageous strategic partnership with Russia does not mean 
that we should have less friendly relations with the United 
States or France, say. I have never concealed that I am a 
supporter of Ukrainian statehood. (?But I have always) been and 
will continue to be a resolute opponent of developing statehood 
on the foundations of isolationism and anti-Russian sentiments. 
  I want to speak separately about the problems of rural 
areas. 
[passage omitted] I regard as inadmissible [words indistinct] 
the forced (?division) of collective farms, for they are now our 
main source of food. I will have an attentive and careful 
attitude to property reforms concerning the land. I think that 
collective farms' land should not be sold, but should belong to 
those who cultivate it. But unproductive land, land under 
buildings and factories, dacha plots, should be sold freely. 
Otherwise private foreign capital will not come to us. 
  In social policy my fundamental position is this: state 
education and health care should be free, because, tell me 
please, who here can pay for this now? A handful of people. 
The wages of doctors, teachers, servicemen, and the militia 
should ensure a dignified life for the individual, and not a 
half-starved existence. I do not want students and pensioners 
to be beggars in our country. But increasing wages to [word 
indistinct], grants and pensions, can be done only if production 
starts to work, and if there are radical changes in the 
structure of the budget. [passage omitted] 
  My opponents shamelessly [words indistinct] special powers, 
but did not use them. But I only had the illusion of power, 
because real power means personnel, administrative structures, 
finances and law enforcement bodies. All of this was in the 
hands of the president and the Supreme Council. The government 
only had the right to issue decrees, which were coordinated with 
the president's team, the president personally, and with the 
Supreme Council. This was only the illusion of power, I repeat. 
My opponents maintain that I (?began) to campaign against the 
mafia, but I did not take the matter to its conclusion. But my 
government conducted hundreds of checks and inspections and 
handed over quite a few [word indistinct] to the procuracy and 
the law enforcement [words indistinct]. 
  I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I will 
have sufficient powers and resoluteness to take what has been 
started to its conclusion. I am in general convinced that the 
new president should from the outset declare real war on 
corruption and crime. My opponents are trying to blame Kuchma 
for the price increases but I know that any respectable 
scientific [word indistinct] can confirm that those who were not 
able to or could not (?take) political decisions were to blame 
for the increases in prices. And (?I was virtually declared an 
enemy) for the attempt to conclude an economic union (?with 
Russia). 
  But it was understandable to all that an economic union 
meant 
markets for our goods, stability of prices for energy-carriers, 
millions of permanent jobs for workers. I am convinced that 
time will (?change understanding) and many people will be 
ashamed of their actions. Today I want to implement these plans 
and ideas, which I was not allowed to implement in 1993. I want 
my children and grandchildren to live in a wealthy, democratic 
sovereign Ukraine within its current borders, so that (?it is) 
equally respected in Russia and America, for them to be proud of 
their state. 
  I want our people to have a worthy life, for order to reign 
in the country, and for people to have faith in the future. I 
want a master to take charge in Ukraine who is responsible for 
everything. All together we have to bring Ukraine out of the 
crisis, work together and build, take care of the old and weak. 
To do this we need to search for unifying and integrating 
(?values), which will unite East and West, North and South. We 
have such human values. These are good, work, accord, order, and 
decency. Thank you.

  [Text] On 16 June, Leonid Kuchma, one of the candidates 
for Ukraine's president, visited Kharkov. At the news 
conference he pointed out that the Interregional Bloc of Reforms 
had been a declaratory structure and attempts had failed to form 
a party on its basis. 
  Speaking about the election of Vitaliy Masol to the post of 
Ukraine's prime minister, Kuchma voiced his discontent, saying 
that "in economic terms this was a step back." 
  Leonid Kuchma stated that he was not sure whether he would 
be 
able to win the elections and suggested that Leonid Kravchuk 
might become the winner.

  [Text] Presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma yesterday 
visited Vinnytsya. On the threshold of 21st century, a 
stone-age economy cannot ensure Ukraine's full-fledged 
existence. In the candidate's opinion, Ukraine's path is to 
develop its economy in a modern way, with a national market and 
capital. Leonid Kuchma stands for mutually beneficial forms of 
integration with the CIS and the entire world. The state has 
already gone through the stage of declaring political 
independence. [Words indistinct] is the confirmation of real 
economic independence, the presidential candidate believes.

  [Text] Leonid Kravchuk, one of the candidates for the 
president of Ukraine, visited Odessa Oblast on 16 June. The 
program of the trip included visits to Izmail and 
Belgorod-Dnestrovskyy, a meeting with Odessa residents in the 
Politechnical University house of culture, and a live program on 
local television. Kravchuk was accompanied by his adviser 
Valentyn Symonenko, Minister of Finance Hryhoriy Pyatachenko, 
Odessa State Administration Head Vladlen Ilyin, Oblast Council 
Chairman Ruslan Bodelan, and Odessa Mayor Leonid Cherneha. 
  Speaking before Odessa residents, Kravchuk negatively 
assessed the reluctance of the oblast council to grant a patch 
of land for the building of the oil terminal. Kravchuk 
emphasized: "I think that the oblast council still has time to 
think and make a decision that would suit Ukraine's interests." 
  Answering a question about his relations with Yeltsin, 
President Kravchuk pointed out: "Our personal relations are 
normal. We even know when we have to telephone each other. 
With regard to Yeltsin's perception of Ukraine, he signed the 
tripartite agreement on behalf of Russia and granted Ukraine 
recognition of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Of 
course, the president of Russia, just like his Ukrainian 
counterpart, has to protect the interests of his state." 
  President Kravchuk shared his opinion about the newly 
appointed Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol. He, in particular, 
pointed out: "I have never been Masol's opponent. In 1990, he 
resigned after he had been summoned to the Ukrainian Communist 
Party Central Committee and proposed to make this step. At that 
time he unsuccessfully tried to find support outside Ukraine." 
  This is how Kravchuk explained his decision to propose 
Masol's candidacy: "My decision was prompted by the specific 
procedure for the Supreme Council's approval. I had to propose 
someone who would not cause a split and opposition. There were 
other candidates, too, but I understood that they did not have a 
chance and preferred not to hurt their feelings. Now, the main 
thing is not to stand in Masol's way." 
  Answering a question about the relations between eastern and 
western Ukraine, Kravchuk stated: "I know both parts well and I 
am sure that no problems exist at the level of ordinary people. 
However, there are gentlemen who shout on behalf of the people. 
Both in the east and the west people want to live free lives." 
  Kravchuk informed the audience that in accordance with a 
presidential edict, the National Bank of Ukraine had transferred 
1.7 trillion karbovantsi to assist the agricultural sector. 
  He added that a fixed exchange rate of the U.S. dollar would 
soon be introduced in Ukraine -- 20,000 karbovantsi. According 
to Kravchuk, should this step fail to significantly influence 
prices, a fluctuating rate will be introduced.

  [Text] Foreign investors will only begin to deposit their 
capital in the Ukrainian economy if there is political and 
economic stabilization. This was stated in an interview with 
the UKRAINSKIYE VEDOMOSTI magazine by Bohdan Havrylyshyn, an 
independent adviser to the Ukrainian president. He noted that 
if the current pace of reform is maintained, Ukraine may end up 
in international isolation and be transformed into an economic 
refugee. Bohdan Havrylyshyn emphasized that without conducting 
deep economic transformations, Ukraine cannot count on financial 
assistance from the West.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received]--The press service of 
the Ukraina democratic association reports that the association 
has written to presidential candidates Valeriy Babych and Petro 
Talanchuk, urging them to withdraw from the presidential race 
for the benefit of Leonid Kravchuk. The statement points out 
that, "in view of the threat to our state's independence, the 
Ukraina democratic association has resolved that the 
situation can be improved only if the current president, Leonid 
Kravchuk, who has proved himself to be a consistent champion of 
Ukrainian statehood and the country's democratic development, 
wins the 26 June election." 
  The Ukraina democratic association has prepared documents in 
support of Kravchuk, signed by the leaders of most of the 
association's parties and organizations. Support groups 
campaigning for the current president will soon leave for 
Ukraine's eastern and southern regions. 
  The press service of the Ukraina democratic association told 
UNIAN that the appeal to the presidential candidates was sent on 
15 June, but no reply has been received thus far.

<F P=106> [Election speech by presidential candidate Volodymyr </F>
Lanovyy; from the "Ahead of the presidential election" program; 
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed compatriots, my dear Ukrainians: This is 
an historic moment. We are choosing the way for us to move 
forward. We are deciding the fate of our country in the very 
near future and after. 
  Our country, whose independence was secured by scores of 
generations of our compatriots in suffering, has not yet become 
our homeland as we had hoped. The state is actually in debt to 
our people and this debt is mounting up, rather than going down. 
We know that we are owed in terms of our bank deposits, in 
terms of payments for agricultural produce, and in terms of 
(?our bonds). We are in fact being deprived of the right to 
work worthily to produce goods, to be able to feed our children 
and elderly, and after many years of work to keep our money in 
savings. Citizens today, unfortunately, are being deprived of 
the possibility to receive adequate medical treatment, to study, 
and to be provided with the bare essentials. Our work is still 
being paid for by monetary substitutes, rather than money. The 
laws on paying wages, pensions and grants are de facto being 
violated in our state. The state is not providing full and 
timely financial support for our country's invalids, servicemen, 
and orphans. Country people are not being paid in time. All 
these are our country's and our state's debts to our people. 
  People are dreaming about their own enterprises. They are 
waiting for what they were promised. Meanwhile, money, foreign 
currency, and some of the most valuable assets are being taken 
away from enterprises. 
  The state of the peasantry, this basis of our country, is 
particularly poor. Today, they do not even have the right to 
their own plot of land where their fathers and grandfathers 
lived. The inactivity of state law enforcement agencies is 
provoking among people mistrust in the authorities and 
uncertainty in the morrow, which will lead to social instability. 
  Today we need strong power and a well-chartered course, 
which 
would lead us to normalizing the situation in the midst of our 
country and putting an end to social, political, and regional 
conflicts. 
  What I am planning to do is this: We need to bring in the 
principle of social justice in society, which is the main thing, 
and to make the economy effective for the sake of our people's 
well-being. People must be able to work freely and earn what 
they have earned, while the state must make adequate financial 
provision for those unable to work. Our task, in fact, is to 
restore our production, curb the crisis, and stabilize prices, 
wages, and money. Everything should be done for enterprises to 
work and be profitable. 
  To that end, we will above all expand enterprises' rights, 
cut taxes, and provide broad opportunities for them to trade and 
export their products, given the mandatory return of the foreign 
currency earned to our Ukraine. We must also create conditions 
that guarantee trade and settlements with Russia in order for us 
to implement joint projects together, thus providing additional 
contracts for our enterprises. By means of steps such as these, 
it will be possible in as short a time as 10 months to stabilize 
our prices, considerably increase budgetary revenues, cut credit 
interest rates, and (?consolidate) our currency. 
  It is, however, impossible to pull out of the crisis without 
improving the state of affairs in agriculture. We must by all 
means turn our attention to the peasantry and create conditions 
for them to work. With this aim, there should be stable prices, 
payment for produce should be guaranteed, every service required 
by the peasantry should be provided for them,and we should make 
everybody the master of their land and the master of their 
farms. Their right of ownership of their money incomes should 
be protected and their bank deposits guaranteed so that the 
peasantry can accumulate their wealth and their property and be 
certain about their future. 
  Overcoming the crisis will make it possible, in my view, in 
as short a time as one year to raise average wages and pensions 
by four- to five-fold. It is only then that we will see some 
return in work by the people and respect for our state. 
  In the first few weeks of my presidential rule, I will 
return 
to the people what the state owes them. We will compensate them 
for their losses from the devaluation of their money in bank 
savings. The people will be given real and equal rights in 
privatizing enterprises and will then have additional incomes 
from owning these enterprises. 
  We will enhance the value of morality in our society and 
begin by changing our attitude toward children, invalids, women, 
and elderly, i.e. those unable to protect themselves. To that 
end, we will introduce new forms of social benefits by 
increasing budgetary revenues. Primarily, it will be monthly 
payments for every child until it reaches the age of 17. 
Second, we will provide special medicines and ecologically safe 
products for those who suffered as the result of Chernobyl or 
who live in contaminated areas. Third, we will increase 
pensions in real terms in order to compensate the people in full 
for their health that has deteriorated, or the life that has 
been lost. The state will also provide all invalids with social 
(?security), which is our moral duty. We will create normal 
conditions for invalids to live and communicate properly and 
actively. 
  None of this can be achieved without reforming state power. 
This primarily applies to the president of Ukraine. He will be 
entirely responsible for the state of affairs in our country and 
for actions by executive power. We have had enough of shifting 
responsibility on to the premier. 
  We will also carry out a judicial reform and form a 
judicial power (?which) would ensure that law is implemented in 
society and would supervise both the president and the Supreme 
Council and other establishments. 
  The division of power, awaited by all of us, must take place 
at national, regional, and local levels. Regions must be given 
the right to settle social and economic issues on their 
territory independently; with this aim they must have a stable 
budgetary basis and taxation, and regulate on their territory 
both the production and investment types of activity. 
  We will resolve the issue of political and economic powers 
with the Republic of Crimea in order to enable Crimea's 
population to live a rich and free life in our country, at the 
same time as ensuring the constancy of its borders and the 
integrity of its territory. We believe that a system of local 
self-government should allow people democratically to influence 
their life, for the land that is being distributed regionally 
and locally out there, and for the communal property and funds 
to be used for the needs of the people that live there [sentence 
as heard]. 
  Russian, Tartar, Polish, and German people and other 
nationalities will live in our country, being proud of their 
Ukrainian citizenship. 
  I am certain that the only way for us is to become a rich 
European state. I believe in the Ukrainian people's power and 
strength. We know what we want. So let us take hold of this 
and decide our future ourselves.

<F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 25 , 13-19 Jun </F>
94] 
  [Text] Over 1994's five months, two-thirds of the planned 
revenues were remitted to the state budget, the then acting 
Premier Yefim Zvyagilski stated in his speech in the Ukrainian 
parliament on 14 June. 
  The cash gap between the planned revenues and budgetary 
expenditures in 1994's 1st quarter amounted to almost 40 
trillion karbovantsi [K]. 
  NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] granted 26.6 trillion 
[currency not specified] credits to bridge it. 
  Considering the latter circumstance, expenditures amounted 
to 
K145 trillion (67 per cent). 
  82.8 per cent of budgetary outlays were channelled to 
welfare 
and support for societal, cultural, educational and other 
state-financed institutions related to the societal domain. 
  According to Mr. Zvyagilski, reduced revenues resulted from 
not only objective causes, but because of "certain ministers and 
departments having failed to take adequate moves to mobilize 
revenues for the state budget, as provided for by the Law." 
  In the meantime, Vitali Masol, the newly appointed prime 
minister of Ukraine, said in his inaugural speech in the 
Ukrainian parliament that, according to IMF experts, about 1.3 
billion US dollars hard currency incomings had failed to return 
to Ukraine in 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Language Test in Moldavia </F>
[Moldova] Deferred"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Russian-speaking specialists 
fearful of crossing the threshold of enterprises and 
organizations because of their inadequate knowledge of the state 
language can now work with equanimity: The Republic's 
parliament has postponed the language proficiency test until 1 
January 1997. The members of the Agrarian Party and specialists 
who had promised during the election campaign to modify the law 
on the functioning of languages have kept the word given by 
parliament. 
  Unlike the members of the Moldavian People's Front, who try 
to exploit this law to carry out ethnic cleansing, the new 
authorities have abolished the Moldavian-language proficiency 
exam for those already working. As all business correspondence 
and technical documentation is already translated into the state 
language, knowledge of it remains a sine qua non. But no one is 
going to be dismissed for paucity of vocabulary. Parliament has 
ordered the government to draw up a new Moldavian-language 
instruction program, recognizing that the previous ones were 
extremely complicated. The range of people to be tested will 
also be specified, but this will be done regardless of the 
categories of specialists who fall within it. The examination 
will be mandatory for the Dniester Region and the southern 
regions, where there is a high density of Russians, Ukrainians, 
Gagauz, and Bulgarians, only when people are being recruited for 
jobs and contracts extended. This has been stipulated by a 
special amendment to the Law on the Functioning of Languages 
since the determination of the special status of these two 
regions.

  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev met at his residence 
today with representatives of leading German communications 
companies--Alkatel-Stel, ERST, and Bundes-Os Telecom. They have 
been working in Kazakhstan for three years in accordance with 
agreements that were signed as a part of a German credit line. 
They are building international, intercity, and local telephone 
exchanges in 10 regions of our republic. 
  Last year, such exchanges were built in Zhezkazgan, Arkalyk, 
Aktau, and Kostanau. They are assembling equipment in 
Petropavlovsk, Kokshetau, Karaganda, Shymkent, and 
Ust-Kamenogorsk. A satellite direct communication line has been 
built recently to connect Akmola and Frankfurt-on-Main. They 
familiarized the president with the results of their activities 
in Kazakhstan and suggested a draft plan for joint work in 
future. According to the business representatives, the 
communications system in Kazakhstan must be privatized. The 
earlier it happens, the bigger the profit will be for the 
republic. 
  Telecom, a joint Kazakhstan-German venture, has been set up. 
It installs electronic international switchboard systems. The 
German side also spoke about the increase in investments to the 
republic. Nazarbayev assured German representatives of his 
support. With regard to the privatization of communications 
systems, the president said that an international tender is due 
to be announced soon for the right of foreign companies to 
cooperate with enterprises of this branch of industry. He 
expressed hope that German companies will participate in the 
tender. 
  Also attending the meeting were Prime Minister Sergey 
Tereshchenko and Foreign Minister Saudabayev.

  [Text] Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev met 
with foreign diplomats and representatives of foreign missions 
accredited in Almaty. Talking to them he stressed the 
irreversibility of democratic transformations and economic 
reforms in the Republic. The program on lifting the country's 
economy out of crisis, highlighted by Nursultan Nazarbayev's 
recent address to parliament, will give new impetus to this. 
The main purpose of the program is to preserve and strengthen 
interethnic accord in the Republic. At present, Kazakhstan is 
known for its essential contribution to ensuring peace, 
security, and stability. "With great pleasure I would like to 
express gratitude for your valuable role in creating a favorable 
political environment around Kazakhstan," Kanat Saudabayev said. 
  Bertrand Fessard de Foucault, the French ambassador to 
Kazakhstan, spoke in reply on behalf of the diplomatic missions. 
He said that this is the first meeting of foreign diplomats 
with Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev since the day Kazakhstan 
obtained its independence. "Each of my colleagues is working in 
Kazakhstan under the extraordinary conditions of the 
transitional period and a huge friendly interest in your 
country," he said. He assured that the diplomatic corps will 
continue to support Kazakhstan's efforts aimed at national 
unity, social progress, and economic development.

militia, the media correspondents were extremely interested in 
the results of the large-scale Kork operation. 
  Internal Affairs Minister Vladimir Shumov and Nikolay 
Prihoske, head of the chief administration for maintenance of 
public order, spoke about strengthening the fight against crime 
and the Kork operation's significance for strengthening 
stability in the Republic. It was noted that the strong support 
of mass-media and [word indistinct] various rumors spread among 
the people have encouraged them to take this action by 
fulfilling their obligation as law protection bodies. 
  During the operation, more than 3,000 crimes have been 
solved. About 8,000 hostels and hotels have been checked. 
Nearly 9,000 persons have been brought to justice for breaking 
passport regulations. More than 1,500 deserters and persons 
evading military service have been tracked down. Around 1,000 
persons using narcotics have been placed on probation. 
  During the operational and preventive operations, 1,836 
illegally held weapons were confiscated. Within five months, 
329 various weapons were voluntarily handed in by the 
inhabitants. More than 6,000 illegally held weapons were 
forcibly confiscated. 
  At the news conference, there was special mention of the 
fact 
that the crime situation in the Republic is negatively affected 
by the diversion of militia workers for the maintenance of law 
and order during unsanctioned actions by various public 
associations. During the last five months around 3,000 militia 
workers were brought [words indistinct]. Only with the 
coordinated action of all 54 organizations and government

  [Excerpts] Dushanbe, 22 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The government 
forces of Tajikistan have destroyed a major stronghold of the 
armed opposition in the foothills of the Pamirs. In the course 
of a two-week operation, which ended recently, several 
antigovernment groups that operated in the gorges of Garmskiy 
and Jirgatalskiy regions were neutralised. Hundreds of weapons 
and large quantities of ammunition were discovered along with 
modern radio equipment of mainly foreign make. According to 
military sources in Dushanbe, Tajikistan's antigovernment forces 
suffered significant losses in clashes with subunits of the 
republican defense and security ministries -- over 20 opposition 
members were killed. Unfortunately, there were also losses among 
servicemen of the Defense Ministry, but the source did not 
specify. [passage omitted] 
  Describing the situation in the area of the Pamir mountains 
and in the Republic's mountain regions to the east of Dushanbe, 
the source called it complex, but quite manageable by the 
government forces. The militia and Security Ministry have set 
up checkpoints in the area's settlements and on all major roads, 
and the search is under way in gorges for militants who could be 
hiding there. 
  Meanwhile, independent sources believe that the 
normalization 
of the situation in Tajikistan's eastern regions is a long way 
away. According to them, the armed opposition, which calls 
itself the partisan resistance movement, has only temporarily 
given in to the onslaught of government forces in the mountains 
and is currently redeploying its forces.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- Having the tendency to further 
aggravation was the description of the situation on the 
Tajik-Afghan frontier given at the press bureau of the Russian 
border guards where the ITAR-TASS correspondent inquired today. 
  According to the border guards' reports, the movement of 
groups of fighters from the provinces of Konduz and Takhor in 
Afghanistan toward Badakhshan continues, for the purpose of 
further dispatch to the territory of Tajikistan. By 22 June the 
number of fighters has reached some 900 men. 
  The personnel of the Pyanj, Moscow, and Khorog frontier 
detachments have since 18 June, in five instances prevented 
illegal crossings of armed gangs of Tajikistan's Islamic Revival 
Movement into the territory of the Republic. Leaders of the 
irreconcilable Tajik opposition and field commanders have been 
given instructions to mount a series of armed and diversionary 
operations against the subunits of the Pyanj and Moscow frontier 
detachments, and also against the civilian population of the 
frontier regions of Tajikistan. 
  At the press bureau of the Russian border guards it was 
reported that on the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous 
Oblast, in the past few days narcotics traders have twice 
attempted to blockade the frontier detachment's base so as to 
provoke the Russian border guards into taking counter measures. 
  The border guards are taking the necessary measures to 
prevent any provocations or cases of frontier violations and are 
prepared to act with utmost decisiveness.

  [Text] Tehran, 18 June, IRNA -- A representative of Tajik 
opposition groups to Iranian-sponsored peace talks in Tehran 
said on Saturday [18 June] that the crisis in Tajikistan should 
be solved through negotiations. 
  Speaking to IRNA, Ata Khan Latifi [name as received] said 
that at present all factions involved in the crisis in 
Tajikistan have reached the conclusion that their problems 
should be solved through dialogue and negotiations. 
  Latifi said that people representing all Tajik opposition 
groups in the peace talks in Tehran would do their best to reach 
an agreement with Tajikistan's government representatives in 
accordance with a plan of action formulated in Moscow. 
  Underlining Iran's positive role in tackling the Tajik 
crisis, Latifi said that Tehran has made its utmost efforts to 
encourage the parties concerned to enter into negotiations. 
  According to him, the talks focused mainly on the return of 
Tajik refugees to their home and the administrative structure of 
future Tajik Government. 
  The Tajik labour minister, Shukurjon Zuhurov, who is 
representing his government in the Tehran peace talks, told IRNA 
that there was no other alternative but to negotiate a peaceful 
solution to the crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, 21 Jun -- The participants in the second 
round of Tajik talks, which began on Saturday [18 June], 
completed their fourth day in the Iranian capital today. There 
were two sessions -- one in the morning and one in the evening. 
If the discussion on the draft agreement on a cease-fire for 
the duration of the talks, as proposed by Romero Piriz Ballon, 
the UN secretary general's special envoy, had yielded some 
positive results, it was expected that a plenary meeting would 
have ensued, with foreign observers taking part. 
  However, the ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Otahon 
Latifi, the head of the Tajik opposition's delegation, that the 
talks are proceeding with difficulty; the sides have been slow 
in moving from one point to the next and have been groping for 
points of contact. But that is no reason for pessimism, Latifi 
said. 
  Labor Minister Shukurjon Zuhurov, leading the Tajik 
Government delegation, confirmed that the sides have thus far 
discussed only the "first paragraphs" of the UN draft. He said, 
however, that the atmosphere at the talks gives reason to feel 
some restrained optimism. 
  The talks between the Tajik delegations will continue 
tomorrow. The UN envoys will take part in them.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] The general level of production in the country 
continues to fall, although slower than before, [Tajikistan] 
Prime Minister Abdulmadjid Samadov has told INTERFAX. 
  He sees one of the main reasons for the current situation in 
the fact that transferring payments between Tajikistan and 
Russia in either direction is still a major problem. Samadov 
believes it would be necessary to draft a plan for a CIS payment 
union at the heads of government level in the near future and 
submit it to the CIS heads of state conference in September. 
"The current situation is unbearable," Samadov said. "True, it 
would be impossible to count on the restoration of ties at the 
previous level, but putting financial and monetary affairs of 
the CIS in order is an urgent need," the Tajik Prime Minister 
said. 
  In his opinion, at the first stage there should be simpler 
rules of transferring payments from country to country, which 
would help stop the decline of economic indices in all CIS 
member-states. 
  Businessmen in both Russia and Tajikistan have been trying 
to 
handle the problem at their level, Samadov said. For instance, 
the recent visit of a Russian delegation under the President of 
the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy to 
Tajikistan was a good start. "Russian experts are working in 
Tajikistan and ice has been broken," the Tajik Prime Minister 
said. 
  Samadov said that effective political reform in Tajikistan 
-- 
the adoption of a new constitution and elections of a President 
and parliament -- was another major condition for overcoming the 
crisis. 
  About the situation in agriculture the Prime Minister said 
that the first phase of field work had been completed and the 
immediate targets formulated by the Council of Ministers early 
this year met. 
  Tajikistan is now faced with another big problem, that of 
acquiring and using mineral fertilizes to achieve high crop 
yields, in the first place, those of cotton, Prime Minister 
Samadov said. He added that Tajikistan's own resources for that 
were not enough. 
  To import mineral fertilizers Tajikistan urgently needs a 
Russian technical credit. Prime Minister Samadov said the 
agreement on the credit was signed by his Russian counterpart 
Viktor Chernomyrdin as early as last March, however, the 
question has not been finally settled yet. 
  According to conservative estimates the use of mineral 
fertilizers would help increase this year's cotton crop 30-40 
percent against last year's and improve to a certain extent 
Tajikistan's financial and economic position. Prime Minister 
Samadov said that a great deal more had been achieved in 
agriculture than in industry or construction this year.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- The law on the federal budget for 
1994 was not adopted as a whole today by the State Duma. Before 
the vote on this issue, Mikhail Zadornov, the chairman of the 
Duma's Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finances, 
said that all the amendments that had been made to it during the 
second reading had been taken into account for the document's 
third reading. He noted that these amendments related, in 
particular, to increased spending on defense and fundamental 
science and also to a 15 percent cut in spending on the 
structure of state administration. The deputy stressed that the 
document had undergone a final expert legal and linguistic 
examination. 
  After this, Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the lower house of 
the Federal Assembly, informed deputies that the third reading 
of this document did not stipulate a debate and he proposed that 
they vote on it as a whole. However, only 194 deputies voted 
for the 1994 budget, while a total of 225 votes was needed for a 
positive outcome. 
  Deputies then left for a break, just prior to the 
announcement of which Rybkin noted that deputies would resume 
the debate on the 1994 budget on their return to the hall.

  [Text] The draft of the federal budget for 1994 failed to 
collect the necessary number of votes (225) for its confirmation 
during a repeated voting in the RF [Russian Federation] State 
Duma Wednesday. As many as 220 deputies voted for it, 46 - 
against, and 33 abstained from voting. A total of 299 deputies 
participated in the voting. 
  A new voting on the draft has been scheduled for 16:00 [1200 
GMT], until that time all factions of the lower chamber will 
discuss this issue. 
  Addressing the deputies before the voting, chairman of the 
chamber's budget committee Mikhail Zadornov warned them that in 
the case that the budget is not adopted the government will be 
forced to present a draft decree on financing for the third and 
fourth quarters, as a result, the State Duma would be left 
without any opportunity to monitor the spending of state funds. 
  The arguments of Fist Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir 
Petrov, who declared that the government cannot receive a credit 
from the Central Bank of Russia without the adopted budget, 
apparently seemed unpersuasive to the members of the chamber. 
Without the loan the state will not be able to finance Russian 
regions this July or pay wages to state employees. Due to the 
delay in the adoption of the budget, he said, the government 
will have no opportunity to carry out the decree on increasing 
of the minimum wage which the State Duma is to consider this 
Wednesday. 
  As many as 194 people voted for the adoption of the budget 
during the first voting, 57 - against, and 44 abstained from 
voting.

  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The State Duma (lower 
chamber) of the Russian Parliament lacked five votes on 
Wednesday to approve the federal draft budget under the third 
reading, but will reconsider it in the evening. 
  With only 221 votes for it, the draft, which was amended 
after its second reading a few days ago, failed to overcome the 
226-vote hurdle. 
  The major disagreement is the defence spendings. The Duma 
wants to keep them at the 40-trillion rouble level, while the 
upper chamber, the Federation Council, wants to increase the 
appropriations to 55 trillion.

<F P=106> [Viktor Mironov report under the "Parliamentary Chronicles" </F>
rubric: "Grachev Will Carry Out the Order"] 
  [Text] Federation Council deputies arriving for the 
seventh session [21 June] were greeted by pickets from the 
military-industrial complex demanding "Provide state orders for 
the defense industry," "Conversion, not convulsion for the 
military-industrial complex!" 
  This lent the discussions of items on the agenda a 
corresponding tone. "The state budget is the most important 
document we will be adopting," Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
the upper chamber of parliament, stressed. He had a brief but 
pithy conversation with the pickets following which he proposed 
that the deputies hear a report on this matter from the 
Federation Council budget committee. In his words, their State 
Duma counterparts had adopted the draft budget on its first and 
second reading with unbelievable ease, without considering the 
252 amendments formulated by the Federation Council deputies. 
"The Duma people are about to approve it on the third reading 
now, so we, too, have got to step on it," Shumeyko remarked. 
  The centerpiece yesterday was of course the president's 
edict 
on the possibility of employing the Russian Federation Armed 
Forces in a peacekeeping operation in the Georgia-Abkhazia 
conflict zone. A report on this problem was provided by Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev behind closed doors, unfortunately. 
  However, the sending of Russian troops into the 
Georgia-Abkhazia conflict zone has been approved in principle. 
"In a matter of literally two or three days, when they report 
to me that the Abkhazia territory has been cleared of mines, we 
shall press ahead directly with the peacekeeping mission," 
Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated after 
this question had been discussed in the upper chamber of 
parliament. According to him, an efficient group has been 
created of five battalions up to 3,000 men strong and it is on 
full combat alert. A question was raised on financing this 
action other than from Defense Ministry appropriations. The 
Defense Ministry, in particular, asked for 10 to 11 billion 
rubles until the year's end but the positive decision was 
yesterday short of a few votes.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Karapetyan: "Federation Council Gives </F>
Go-ahead to Introduction of Peacekeeping Forces into Abkhazia"] 
  [Text] At a closed session on 21 June Federation Council 
deputies discussed President Boris Yeltsin's edict on the 
introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. 
  Let me remind you that the previous session was just one 
vote 
short of the number needed to ratify the edict. But this time, 
after hearing a report from Army General Pavel Grachev, the 
Russian defense minister and the president's representative at 
the session, the deputies voted by a majority for the 
introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces (with seven votes 
against and seven abstentions). 
  Answering journalists' questions, Army Gen Pavel Grachev 
expressed satisfaction at the Federation Council's decision but 
stated that the troops will not go into the conflict zone "at 
breakneck speed." Around 3,000 men will be transferred to the 
deployment area only after the locality has been cleared of 
mines. According to Army Gen. Pavel Grachev's estimates, it 
will take three to five days to occupy the bridges and carry out 
engineering operations. The first to be moved up will be two 
battalions from the 145th Motorized Rifle Division (Batumi) and 
one parachute regiment from the 345th Airborne Troops (Gudauta). 
As soon as these three battalions "take control of the sector" 
a further two reinforced motorized rifle battalions will be 
flown in. Control centers have already been prepared, 
communications have been organized, and all the material and 
technical support is in place for the peacekeeping action for 
which, as Army Gen Pavel Grachev announced, "we have requested 
10-11 billion rubles before the end of the year." One is bound 
to recall here that the federal budget has not been approved 
yet.... 
  At the last moment the question of the federal budget was 
deleted from the Federal Council session agenda. When one of 
the deputies asked for the budget to be "heard" on 23 June 
anyway, Vladimir Shumeyko stated that this was impossible for 
purely formal reasons: The State Duma has not officially 
presented the draft law on the federal budget for the Federation 
Council's approval. In so saying he noted that, when the Duma 
adopted it on second reading, it did not take into account the 
Federation Council's 252 amendments to the budget and the budget 
was adopted by a "political consensus." 
  After declaring that the budget is an especially political 
document, Vladimir Shumeyko made the following comment: "There 
is a version to satisfy everyone." At the same time he implied 
that if the Duma delayed in handing on the draft budget law to 
the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, the Federation 
Council would not have time to discuss it, "and then everyone 
will begin saying that the budget has not been adopted because 
of the Federation Council's arrogance. I must ask the Duma to 
speed up the adoption of a decision. At the very least it must 
be ready to adopt a good law for the government, where spending 
will be decided." 
  Nevertheless, on the evening of 21 June and not without 
pressure from the pickets (around 100 placard-wielding 
representatives of defense sector enterprises had gathered by 
the entrance to the building),the Federation Council deputies 
did discuss the problems of the military-industrial complex and 
the draft federal budget and did adopt a request to the State 
Duma to submit the draft in good time.

  [Text] The State Duma's draft resolution, approved on 
Wednesday urges the Russian president to suspend the decree on 
urgent measures to protect the population from banditry and 
organized crime. 
  The resolution was supported by 246 deputies and opposed by 
6, with 9 abstentions. 
  It is expected to be adopted in the evening. 
  The draft resolution says that the decree seriously limits 
the constitutional rights and liberties of Russian citizens 
without due reasons, and is at variance with the Constitution 
and a number of articles of the Criminal Code. 
  It also says that the Constitution and the federal laws have 
supreme status in the entire territory of the Russian Federation 
and that the Supreme Court must be guided by the Constitution 
and the current laws in handling specific cases. 
  The vote followed a report by head of the security committee 
Viktor Ilyukhin of the Communist faction who said the 
presidential decree was in breach of as many as eight articles 
in the federal Constitution. He said the measure derailed 
criminal legislation and suspended the existing Criminal Code. 
  For his part, head of the administration's human rights 
commission Sergey Kovalyev said that "we have once again run 
into a situation where government departments write laws for 
themselves." He spoke of having evidence that the decree was 
initialled by heads of the Interior Ministry and Federal 
Counterintelligence Service (FSK). 
  First Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Yegorov admitted to 
being one of the decree's authors and pledged to be personally 
responsible for carrying it out. He called for approving the 
paper and gave reassurances that any police action would be 
monitored by prosecuting bodies. 
  Presidential representative in the Federal Assembly 
Aleksandr 
Yakovlev also called to approve the decree. He said President 
Yeltsin was seeking to do his best to crack down on gangsters 
and ensure guarantees against police tyranny. 
  The president plans to send a bill on amendments to the 
Criminal Code next week, Yakovlev said. He said the decree 
would not be workable unless the law enforcement agencies came 
up with rules on how to implement it, and offered deputies to 
join a working group on this matter.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The Russian State Duma 
rejected on Wednesday a communist proposal to "declare null and 
void" the upcoming Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" plan which is to be signed by Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev in Brussels today. 
  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov said in the lower house 
that the NATO partnership plan is "US expansionism aimed against 
Russia". 
  He compared it to the notorious "Barbarossa" plan of Adolf 
Hitler which was used to invade the former Soviet Union exactly 
53 years ago - on June 22, 1941 when Nazi Germany attacked the 
USSR. 
  However, the Duma voted down the communist proposal to 
include the issue into the agenda.

  [Text] If the term of the powers of deputies to the Federal 
Assembly and the president are extended for two more years, the 
period of stability in Russia could continue for another three 
years. This is what Federation Council Speaker Vladimir 
Shumeyko thinks. In his words, Boris Yeltsin does not object to 
this step and also thinks it necessary to extend the period of 
stable work. 
  But we remind you that in an interview to Radio Ekho Moskvy, 
Boris Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov said that 
Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative had only been heard of in the 
apparatus of the head of state today from a dispatch received 
there. 
  Today the initiative of the Speaker of the Federation 
Council 
was also supported by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. In his 
opinion the idea could be implemented on three conditions, 
namely: If elements of stabilization emerge in the country in 
the next few months; if the country's legislative network is 
formed in the right way; and finally, if both the chambers of 
the Federal Assembly prove their competence. 
  However, major factions of the State Duma were extremely 
skeptical regarding the initiative of the chairman of the upper 
chamber on extending the powers. Our correspondent reports on 
this: 
  [Correspondent Ivan Tresilov] Although the factions and 
groups have not worked out united positions, individual 
representatives among them have already expressed their opinion 
on this. 
  Aleksandr Savtsov, of Russia's Choice, expressed himself 
more 
accurately: I see nothing here but an attempt to buy deputies. 
  Communist Viktor Zorkin called the proposals unethical and 
Yabloko member Viktor Sheynis called the move amoral. 
  Boris Fedorov, leader of the 12 December Union, also called 
for holding elections at the normal time. 
  Only leader of the Liberal Democrats [LDPR] Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy immediately entered the fray and started vigorous 
bargaining. In his words, the LDPR will support the extension 
of powers if a new government is formed on the basis of his 
party. 
  Ivan Tresilov, Ekho Moskvy, State Duma.

  [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of 
Russian parliament) Ivan Rybkin has expressed support to his 
counterpart from the upper house Vladimir Shumeyko's proposal to 
extend the term in office of deputies and the president. 
  In an interview with Interfax, he said the idea was first 
put 
forward by member of the State Duma Mikhail Poltoranin two 
months ago. 
  However, Rybkin thinks three main conditions must be met 
before the proposal is implemented: the economy must show signs 
of stabilization in the next two or three months; the country's 
legislative network be arranged in a proper way; and the two 
houses prove workable. 
  Rybkin said he would be happy to see the terms of office for 
the parliament and head of state extended after those conditions 
had been met.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Yemelin: "What Is the Way Out? Agrarians' </F>
Conference in State Duma"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has been working for six months now 
but there are still no laws whatever regulating relations in the 
economy's agrarian sector. Why is this? What are the reasons 
for such a long period of disorder? 
  It emerges that the answer is fairly simple. An extremely 
irregular situation has arisen with regard to the passage of 
draft laws on agrarian reform. The list of priority legislative 
acts in this area was decided long ago, and work on them has 
been and continues to be carried out. However, the government 
has not officially submitted a single draft law to the State 
Duma. And the drafts which the Duma committee on agrarian 
questions has elaborated do not receive support from 
the...government. This is a vicious circle! 
  In order to get a clear and unequivocal picture of the 
sides' 
positions, last Friday (17 June) members of the Duma's agrarian 
faction and leaders of the agrarian sector met -- Vice Premier 
A. Zaveryukha, V. Khlystun, minister of agriculture and food, N. 
Komov, chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Land 
Resources and Land Management, S. Ignatyev, deputy minister of 
economics, A. Krasnopivtsev, deputy minister of finance, and 
other executives from government structures. 
  The deputies were unanimous that the draft agrarian laws are 
clearly being blocked by the government team. All references to 
difficulties in coordination were deemed to be unfounded. Our 
draft laws, M. Lapshin emphasized, are being blocked not for 
technical but for ideological reasons. 
  What remains in Russia that has not been privatized? Only 
the land, it seems. For this very reason radical reformers are 
stubbornly seeking to adopt first of all a Civil Code 
incorporating paragraphs which make land a commodity, and only 
then to enshrine these provisions in a Land Code. 
  In the opinion of Deputy V. Vershinin, the agrarian sector's 
leaders are today powerless to change the situation somehow. It 
is necessary to appeal to the president and the public. It has 
actually been decided to make such an appeal. These most 
important questions for the fate of rural areas will be broached 
in the course of the forthcoming meeting between agrarian 
deputies and the Russian president 27 June.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Duma in Time Trouble"] </F>
  [Text] The course of the 17 June plenary session of the 
State Duma and its results seriously shook hopes that this 
chamber of the Federal Assembly would prove to be more capable 
of legislative activity than its predecessor, the Supreme 
Soviet. As is well known, in the course of this session day 
packed with stormy debates and scandals not one legislative act 
received any reading. It would appear that the Duma expended 
all its creative potential on the adoption of the budget and has 
subsequently proved ready only for political, largely 
internecine, battle. 
  Such an evolution of the country's supreme legislative organ 
looks particularly striking against the background of the 
gathering pace of the president's activity; in the course of the 
past week he not only completed a lightning tour of important 
Russian regions, but also continued the preparation and 
publication of a series of edicts, among which the edict on 
stepping up the battle against gangsterism has attracted the 
most attention. 
  The Duma has not been able to deliver an intelligible 
response to a single one of these presidential initiatives. The 
compromise proposed by a number of Duma leaders -- to postpone 
the entry into force of the edict on combating crime until the 
appearance of an analogous law, which the Duma promised to adopt 
in two weeks -- looks unrealistic. First, the Duma has had 
almost six months to adopt such a law. However, instead of 
doing so, legislators used the lion's share of the time to 
prepare and adopt the law on the deputies' status and the decree 
on the creation of parliamentary radio and television 
broadcasting. The law on the budget, adopted at the second 
reading, in this sense looks like the exception without which, 
as we know, there is no rule. Second, July is the last month of 
the session's work. Thus deputies of the chamber have only 10 
plenary sittings ahead. The timetable of legislative work has 
long since been disrupted, probably irreversibly. In addition, 
the disposition of political forces in the Duma gives no grounds 
for hope that a law devoted to combating organized crime can be 
adopted quickly enough, even if preparation of all other 
legislative acts is put to one side for this purpose. And, of 
course, factional boycotts and deputies' strikes -- which we 
have also witnessed over the past week -- cannot be ruled out. 
  At the same time deficiencies in legislative activity were 
more than compensated for by an upsurge in aggressiveness. A 
number of episodes at the 17 June session put one in mind of the 
scenes played out at the Congresses of People's Deputies. It is 
insufficient to attribute this to the speaker's absence from the 
session, although I. Rybkin does indeed demonstrate masterly 
control of the Duma. But it is impossible not to focus 
attention on the fact that the main sources of tension in the 
Duma last week were by no means the representatives of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction, but the leaders of 
the nonregistered deputies' groups "12 December" and "Russia's 
Path." 
  It is improbable that the roots of this activity lie 
exclusively in an innate sense of justice causing deputies to 
contend with the Duma Council, which, in their opinion, has both 
usurped power in the chamber and has turned into a counterpart 
of the old Supreme Soviet Presidium. On the contrary, it is 
more likely that it is a question of attempts to penetrate this 
leading parliamentary organ themselves by any means, including 
some which closely resemble blackmail. Moreover, it is hardly 
exclusively in order to obtain the additional benefits which 
registered factions and groups enjoy. Their main aim here seems 
to be their inclusion, as quickly as possible, in the existing 
system of the political establishment, and, as a consequence, 
their inclusion on equal terms in the political process, which 
is hard to describe as anything other than preparation for 
elections. 
  Everything which happened in the Duma last week creates a 
fairly firm impression that deputies assessed the president's 
press conference and his legislative activity as the beginning 
of the election campaign. What is more, they found themselves 
at the same time grouped with the laggards who have lost the 
initiative and effectively find themselves in time trouble. 
After all, less and less time remains until the elections, and 
there are so far, alas, not many grounds to be proud of their 
achievements. 
  The president's expedited legislative activity, which is 
taking place against the background of the Duma's poor 
effectiveness, the ambiguous situation over the General 
Prosecutor's Office, and the absence of the Constitutional 
Court, although it will most likely increase B. Yeltsin's 
popularity with the voters, could also have quite unexpected 
consequences. The upsetting of the balance between the the 
legislature and the executive in the favor of the latter can 
already be seen extremely clearly today. It is not hard to 
suppose that irate charges of usurping power will be leveled 
against the president in fairly short order by the State Duma. 
However, at the same time it would not be superfluous to remind 
the initiators of such charges that they themselves in their 
time have ignored many instruments of power under their full 
control. Such as, for example, the constitutional laws on the 
Constitutional Court, on the president, and on the elections. 
At least, nothing is heard today of the preparation of these 
legislative acts.

  [Text] Yerevan ("RESPUBLICA ARMENIA" (Past), "LRAGIR" 
dailies), 06/21/94 -- A Mediation Delegation, headed by the CSCE 
Minsk group Chairman Jan Eliasson, started its visit to the 
region on June 14. 
  Members of the delegation arrived from Baku to Yerevan on 
June 16, and met First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Zhirair Liparityan. The delegation left to Stepanakert on the 
same date, and returned back to Yerevan on June 17 and met the 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. On June 18, members of the 
delegation met Liparityan again, and then left for Baku. On 
June 19, Eliasson returned from Baku to Yerevan, and negotiated 
with the Armenian authorities. He left the Armenian capital on 
the same day. No other details are reported by official 
Armenian press services. 
  According to preliminary estimates, visit of the CSCE Minsk 
group Chairman Jan Eliasson to the region has finished without 
notable results. Jan Eliasson said that the sides are still 
keeping rather harsh stances. In addition to this, the incident 
at the north- western section of the RA border on June 18 may 
seriously affect further negotiations. 
  Chairman of the Minsk group wasn't able to find any 
solutions 
to oppose the Russian project. He met unexpected obstacles in 
Azerbaijan to implementation of their plan of the Karabakh 
conflict's resolution. According to "Lragir", Baku suggested to 
involve the problem of liberating Shusha and Lachin from 
Armenian forces in the CSCE project. This topic is absent in 
the current version of the CSCE plan, being unacceptable to the 
Armenian side.

  [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN" daily), 06/21/94 
-- RA [Republic of Armenia] Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a 
declaration, which particularly says: 
  "The Azeri military units shelled the north-eastern 
districts 
of the republic at 5am on June 5, and penetrated into the 
Noyemberyanskiy district. Having attacked the frontier post at 
the village of Barekamavan, the Azeris killed and outraged 6 
Armenian frontier guards, wounded one and captured one frontier 
guard. 
  RA government believes that this provocation attack, in 
conditions when no military operations are carried out, 
evidences aggravation of the Azeri position and its negative 
attitude towards serious negotiations. This attack coincided in 
time with CSCE Minsk group Chairman's visit to Armenia. 
Therefore, this was, in fact, an attempt to fail Jan Eliasson's 
mission. 
  RA government demands official apologies and corresponding 
explanations from the Azeri authorities, as well as immediate 
return of the captured frontier guard and to cover the expenses 
caused by the attack. 
  Until the Azeri government does not satisfy the mentioned 
demands, RA government will seriously consider the question of 
stopping all negotiations on resolution of the Karabakh 
conflict. Responsibility for all consequences of failing the 
negotiations will lie on the Azeri republic. 
  Paying a great importance to de-facto cessation of military 
operations in Mountainous Karabakh during the month, and hoping 
that this may become a basis for a legal cease fire and for 
successful negotiations on resolution of the conflict, RA 
ordered its units not to respond to this provocative operation. 
Nevertheless, if such actions are repeated, RA keeps the right 
to take adequate measures."

  [Text] Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported 
that the army units in Nakhichevan continued to encroach on the 
border of Araratskiy Rayon last night. The enemy shelled the 
defensive positions around Yeraskhavan with various firearms, 
howitzers, and grenade launchers between 1945-2150. There were 
casualties. The Armenian border guards adhered to the 
cease-fire and did not retaliate. 
  The cars travelling along Kiran-Voskepar road were 
periodically fired upon from Kazakhskiy Rayon between 2250-0100. 
There were no casualties. Again, our fighters did not 
retaliate. 
  The same source reported that the situation has remained 
calm 
on the rest of Armenian border regions since last night. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army press service 
reported 
that despite periodic shelling of the Karabakh defensive 
positions in certain sectors of the conflict zone by the 
Azerbaijanis, the cease-fire is basically holding. The Armenian 
fighters are not retaliating.

<F P=106> [Text of the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs </F>
Statement; date not given] 
  [Text] The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes 
that it is essential to draw attention to developments within 
the framework of the effort made to find a peaceful solution to 
the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is common 
knowledge that the disputing sides have generally heeded the 
cease-fire agreement for more than a month. 
  Regrettably, Armenia has violated the cease-fire several 
times during the past few days. That has had serious 
consequences. For example, several towns in Sadarak Rayon in 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic [NAR] were shelled with 
heavy artillery on 19 June. Considering that, the Azerbaijan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirms that compliance with the 
cease-fire agreement along the entire front line, which 
constitutes [words indistinct] in the negotiations process, is 
essential. 
  The evidence--which confirms that the representatives of 
Armenia and the Armenian community in Karabakh have tried to 
avoid the outcome of the consultations held in Moscow between 
the [words indistinct] and the delegations which represented 
Azerbaijan and the Azerbaijani community in Daghlyk-Karabakh 
[Nagorno-Karabakh] with Russian mediation--is astonishing. 
Azerbaijan resolutely supports the effort to find a political 
solution to the dispute, which has continued for many years and 
created many misfortunes for the Armenian and Azerbaijani 
peoples. Matters related to the finding of a political solution 
to the dispute, consolidation of the cease-fire, withdrawal of 
military forces from Azerbaijan's occupied territories, and 
establishment of the future political status of Daghlyk-Karabakh 
in Azerbaijan should [words indistinct]. 
  Furthermore, Azerbaijan applauds the [word indistinct] 
mediation effort for the resumption of the peace process by the 
CSCE, Russia, and the CIS in order to completely end the 
dispute. The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs views the 
present situation as a turning point and urges all responsible 
bodies to act with goodwill to contribute to the establishment 
of peace.

  [Text] Baku, June 20 (TURAN) -- Gudrat Abdulsalimzade, head 
of the Committee for Property told at today's press-conference 
that the Committee submitted to the Milli Mejlis new draft of 
privatization program. 
  The new draft provides increase of privatisation share of 
each civilian of the republic to 120,000 manats. "It has been 
done in connection with the last overestimation of the 
privatised property", said Abdulsalimzade. 
  According to the program 8,768 enterprises and objects are 
scheduled to be privatized in 1994. It makes 14.8 percent of 
all enterprises and objects of the republic, covers 5 percent of 
all funds and 3.1 percent of all employees working in the state 
section. 
  Expenses for privatisations will total 400 million manats in 
1994, said the Head of the Committee. According to him, "small" 
privatization, i.e. privatization of enterprises totalling no 
more than 200 people, is to complete in 1995. Middle and part 
of large enterprises will be privatized during 1996-1998. 
  Answering journalists question concerning the delay in the 
adoption of the program, even after it was signed by President, 
Abdulsalimzade said that there are people in the highest 
legislative body and in the ministries and among the leaders of 
enterprises, opposing the privatization program. 
  The high rank employee of the Committee for Property told 
TURAN that there are two approaches to this problem in the 
highest circles. "The part of them want to organise wholesale 
of state property, the others are opposed [to] privatization at 
all, referring to the war. "Privatization will not take place 
until they come to common decision", said the employee. 
  Law for privatization was adopted in Azerbaijan on January 
7, 
1993. Up to today only 5,000 taximotors [taxicabs] are 
privatized in the country.

  [Text] This information came from the Defense Ministry 
press service. 
  On 21 June, Lieutenant General Vardiko Nadibaidze, defense 
minister of the Republic of Georgia, received Kent Brown, U.S. 
ambassador to Georgia, who was accompanied by high-ranking 
officials from the U.S. Department of Defense. The meeting was 
attended by Major General Nodar Tatarashvili, chief of the 
General Staff. 
  The defense minister told guests about changes in the Armed 
Forces, which had begun following his appointment as minister. 
The main purpose of these changes is to create a small but 
capable and modern Georgian Army. In order to attain this 
difficult objective, we are receiving a great deal of assistance 
from our partners--the command of the Russian troops in the 
Transcaucasus. However, we would also be pleased to receive 
assistance from our U.S. colleagues and are ready to cooperate 
with them within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program in order to safeguard peace in the region, Nadibaidze 
said. 
  At the end of the meeting, the minister thanked guests for 
the visit and for the attention that the United States was 
giving to Georgia and its army construction, adding that 
contacts between the the two countries' military would develop 
further.

state and chairman of parliament, received Russian Ambassador to 
Georgia Vladimir Zemskiy. The ambassador presented to the head 
of state a letter from Boris Yeltsin in which the Russian 
president thanks Eduard Shevardnadze for his message of 
greetings on Russian Independence Day, and expresses confidence 
that friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia will 
continue for the benefit of the two countries' peoples. 
  The two discussed today's decision by Russia's Federation 
Council, authorizing the deployment of Russian peacekeeping 
forces in the conflict zone in Abkhazia. The head of state said 
that the decision is very important. He stressed that this 
international initiative by Russia is of historic importance not 
only for Georgia, and that its success would be a prerequisite 
for stability in the Transcaucasus. In the opinion of Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the success of the operation will boost Russia's 
international reputation, and would be a positive example to 
other countries.

<F P=106> [Video report from Georgia by correspondent Georgiy </F>
Ratishvili, including recording of interview in office with 
Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhaz 
Republic, by unidentified correspondent -- from the "Novosti" 
newscast] 
  [Text] Today the sapper units of Russian peacekeeping 
forces have continued the search and clearing of mines both on 
Abkhaz and Georgian territories. The checkpoints will probably 
start operating soon. Work has been going on since dawn to set 
them up. Also today, work resumed on repairing the 25 
meter-long bridge across the Inguri. It will be used by 
military formations of Russia's Transcaucasus group of troops to 
enter the Gali areas of Abkhazia. This is precisely the 
peacekeeping contingent that will create conditions for the safe 
return of refugees to Abkhazia in the near future. Now that the 
issue of the introduction of the Russian peacekeepers into the 
area of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict has been completely 
resolved, these forced immigrants have a real chance of 
returning home. 
  [Correspondent] Vladislav Georgiyevich, how do you assess 
today's decision by the Federation Council that Russian troops 
can be used in the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia? 
  [Ardzinba] In Abkhazia the decisions of the Federation 
Council and the president's decree have been received with 
satisfaction. We hope that the deployment of the troops on the 
border between the Abkhaz and the Georgian states will create 
the necessary conditions to prevent a new war, to stabilize the 
situation in the region, and to continue talks on a full-scale 
settlement of relations between Abkhazia and Georgia. After the 
troops are deployed, we will be ready to consider questions 
connected with the resumption of work by communication lines 
linking Russia with the republics of the Transcaucasus, and 
generally we hope that Russia's economic policy in relation to 
Abkhazia, whose population has shouldered all the hardships of 
war, will change.

  [Text] Tbilisi -- "All states belonging to the CIS must 
have peacemaking battalions, since we cannot rely on Russia all 
the time," Georgian parliamentary deputy Tengiz Kitovani 
believes. 
  He has advocated the creation of the republic's own 
peacemaking units, so as to have the possibility of 
participating in the settlement of conflicts in neighboring 
regions. He proposes to form battalions of "blue helmets" on 
the basis of the National Guard and the recently disbanded 
military police. At the same time Kitovani ignored the question 
of where it is proposed to find the funds to maintain them.

the region adjacent to the village of Rukhi near the bridge 
across the River Inguri, the press center of the Russian troops 
in the Transcaucasus told Interfax. Control posts are being 
built on both banks of the river, after which the work to 
restore the Inguri bridge will begin. 
  Deputy Commander of the Russian troops in the Transcaucasus 
Major-General Vassiliy Belchenko told Interfax that two 
battalions were ready to take part in the peacekeeping mission 
in Abkhazia. He said that these battalions' bases will be 
determined by Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev who is 
in charge of the peacekeeping operation. The operation itself 
is to begin during the next two days, said Belchenko. 
  The Georgian Defense Ministry's press center informed 
Interfax that the Georgian troops and heavy equipment had been 
removed from the security zone in the region of the peacekeeping 
operation over to the Senaki Region. Only local police units 
still remain in the 12-kilometer zone in the Zugdidi and the 
Tsalendzhikha regions, said the Georgian Defense Ministry's 
spokesman.

with a great number of questions having been asked. There was a 
vote, during which President Yeltsin's decree was approved by an 
absolute majority of votes. Therefore, the introduction of 
Russian Federation peacekeeping troops to the region of Abkhazia 
will begin 22 June.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Viktor Litovkin datelined </F>
Gali-Sukhumi-Gudauta: "Wearing Bulletproof Vests and Blue 
Helmets Beneath Abkhazia's Sultry Sky. Report by IZVESTIYA's 
Special Correspondent Viktor Litovkin from the 
Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict Zone"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Backup for Reconnoitering Operations </H5>
  Heavy transport aircraft approached the Bombora military 
airfield in Gudauta from the sea and, one after another, landed 
on the scorching concrete strip. They disgorged space, 
tropospheric, and radio relay communications stations, as well 
as command-staff and engineering obstacle-clearing vehicles, 
bulldozers, excavators, graders, and bridgelayers. Soldiers 
carrying heavy loads on their shoulders ran down the ramps, 
while Colonel General Kondratyev, Russia's deputy defense 
minister, called a briefing for journalists who had arrived in 
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone. 
  "Let me make it clear to you once more, gentlemen," he said, 
"that what you are seeing is not at all the start of a 
peacemaking operation but just the preparations for embarking on 
it." 
  Some 30 minutes earlier the general had a telephone 
conversation with Moscow. He was told: A major scandal had 
erupted at the State Duma because the introduction of Russian 
peacemaking forces in Georgia has yet to be approved by the 
Federation Council while the military, ignoring this decision as 
usual, have already launched their actions. 
  "Let me repeat," Gen. Kondratyev said, "that the peacemaking 
troops will not arrive before the 21st [of June], I am convinced 
that the deputies will -- and cannot but -- back the president, 
while at present we are only deploying communications centers, 
we are here to clear mines and repair bridges using engineering 
equipment, we are conducting reconnoitering...." 
  What is the meaning of the word "reconnoitering," a meaning 
that is so obscure to civilians? Any military school graduate 
or platoon leader can rap out -- as if reciting the Lord's 
Prayer -- that it means the visual study of a locality and the 
enemy. It is conducted by the commanding officer in person when 
organizing combat operations, moving troops, or selecting sites 
for their placement. Its purpose is to confirm decisions made 
using topographic maps. 
  This is how it was conducted at the rayon center of Gali, 
where the staff of the first control zone, a communications 
center, and two battalions -- an amphibious landing battalion 
and an engineering-sapper battalion -- are stationed. 
  "There is our military commissariat," Galskiy Rayon 
Administration Leader Ruslan Kishmariya pointed at a small 
building surrounded by palm trees. "Right opposite you have the 
former Georgian high school, with two buildings ready and 
waiting to accommodate your soldiers." 
  The "ready and waiting" buildings are an older two-story 
block and a newer three-story block; the glass is missing from 
most windows, having been shot out in the course of battles; 
there are no tables or desks; the sanitary equipment, 
electricity cables, and light bulbs have been plundered. But 
this does not intimidate anyone. While in Tskhinvali, our 
soldiers wintered in the shot-up barracks of the former 
helicopter regiment. 
  "Fine," Gen. Kondratyev nodded. "We will site the staff and 
the communications center at the military commissariat, park the 
equipment in the school yard, and station the battalions inside 
the buildings. Sapper," he summoned the representative of the 
engineering troops chief, "bring along glass panes, cement, and 
whatever else is needed to repair the buildings, let us leave 
them behind as new. We will install a bakery...." 
  "There is no need to bring a bakery, Comrade General," the 
administration head interrupted, "ours is working below full 
capacity. We will be only too happy to bake bread for the 
Russian soldiers. But flour is the only problem...." 
  The bread situation is very difficult in Abkhazia, now 
enjoying plentiful supplies of fruit and vegetables, but 
suffering from fire damage and semideserted because a good 
one-half of the population has fled the country seeking to 
escape the war. There is virtually no bread in Sukhumi, 
Gudauta, or Ochamchira, let alone Gali. There is no need to 
further amplify the meaning of Ruslan Kishmariya's offer. But 
the deputy minister did not go into details. 
  "Very well," the general said. "We will bring in flour, as 
well as all the rest -- like gasoline, diesel fuel, and 
construction materials. Our army will be completely 
self-sufficient." 
  A colonel whom I know, representing the General Staff, 
whispered: 
  "Where are we going to get the money for all this? Last 
year's peacemaking operations cost the Army 26 billion [currency 
not specified]; costs during the first quarter of this year 
reached 14 billion, the introduction of battalions in Abkhazia 
cost 3 billion, while the cost of their stay here, added to the 
costs incurred in the Dniester region, in South and North 
Ossetia, and in Tajikistan, runs at 0.5 trillion every six 
months. And all this comes out of the military's purse. You 
would think that it is the Ministry of Defense, rather than the 
state, that needs Russia's presence in the Caucasus and peace 
along its borders." 

<H5>    Mine-Detecting Dogs -- Another Item in Short Supply in </H5>
Our Army 
  Some 1.5 km away from the high-altitude Inguri hydroelectric 
power station, Abkhazian regimental commander Alik Arshba used a 
topographic map to show Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Karkodola, 
deputy commander of the Russian engineering-sapper team, the 
sites of mine fields along the Abkhazian-Georgian border in the 
sector of the zone assigned to him. 
  "They are everywhere along the Inguri floodplains," Alik 
said. "On both sides of the border. There are plenty of them in 
the forest, here for example," and he moved his pencil along the 
green areas around Hill 2176, "and here," the pencil moved about 
a centimeter lower down, "and here.... We do not have a 
continuous frontline, there is a shortage of men, saboteurs and 
sundry other rabble sneak through constantly, and so our guys 
have scattered mines wherever they could," he explained. 
  "Do you have any documentation -- mine field maps, any other 
paperwork?" 
  "You must be joking. Do you think we employ specialists? 
Let me tell you, I personally am an English language teacher, I 
was an instructor at the Komsomol [Communist Youth League] rayon 
committee until perestroyka times," Arshba laughed out. "The 
war forced me to take up arms. Others as well." 
  I met Col. Karkodola on the flight to Gudauta. It emerged 
that, back in 1984, he commanded a platoon of the Bagram 108th 
Motorized Rifle Division's engineering-sapper battalion. While 
on official travel in Afghanistan, I had met some of his 
comrades and had written about them. We reminisced about the 
mine-detecting service's sheepdogs Chana, Bina, and Nord which 
had helped our soldiers to clear the deadly implants placed at 
every step of the way along the roads and in the villages there. 
They each had about 100-150 detected mines to their credit. 
  "Chana would be quite useful here," the lieutenant colonel 
said, "even though she was already past her peak in 1984. A 
mine-detecting dog's service life is not long, just two years, 
after that -- having sniffed and breathed in plenty of TNT -- it 
dies of cirrhosis of the liver. But the dog is irreplaceable in 
mountains and forests or along river banks -- heavy equipment 
cannot get there." 
  Aleksandr gave me a detailed account of how dogs are trained 
in mine detection. Apparently, they do not add tolite to their 
feed as I had previously thought, but feed them on explosives. 
The sheepdog gets used to the smell while feeding. And then it 
seeks food, not mines. A mine detection service team consists 
of two instructor soldiers and two dogs. A male and a female 
dog without fail. Otherwise they would fight and would not get 
down to work. The male dog leads the way, the female follows so 
as not to distract him with her smell. 
  It takes nine months to train a dog for this work, and 
five-and-a-half months to train its instructor. They can detect 
mines together for only six months -- the serviceman then has to 
be discharged in the reserve. Getting the sheepdog used to a 
new handler also takes almost six months. But this is 
unavoidable. The number of professional contract servicemen in 
the Russian Army's mine detection service can be counted on 
one's fingers. None of them is here in Abkhazia. 
  The explanation is simple. The Army is now experiencing a 
shortage not only of draftees, contract servicemen, and 
officers, but also of mine-detecting dogs. 
  They used to be trained at the Dmitrovskaya Military 
Dog-Handling School, Russia's only such school, which at one 
time used to have about 50 sheepdogs highly trained in mine 
detection. But, due to the increasingly frequent raids on 
arsenals and arms dumps, all these dogs have been retrained to 
guard ammunition and have been dispersed among the various 
military districts. There is no money to train replacements -- 
one such trained dog costs almost 1 million. 
  A grand total of...10 mine detection teams, in other words 
10 
soldiers and just as many mine-detecting dogs, have been found 
in Leningrad Military District to cover the entire 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone with an area of 4,368 square 
km, with some 100,000 mines and other explosive surprise gifts 
like unexploded shells and land mines scattered all over the 
place, and nobody knows where and how they have been planted. 
  "God forbid," Lt. Col. Karkodola said, "that one of our guys 
should be injured by a mine -- blame will be pinned on everyone 
but those who are skimping on our soldiers' safety. Do you know 
the value of our lives here, in the 'hot spot'? 100,000 net. 
You cannot even dig a grave for that money nowadays." 

<H5>    The UN Mission -- Out of Play </H5>
  I met with Brigadier General John Hvedegard, chief military 
observer and leader of the UN mission in Georgia, in his office 
on the third story of the "generals' block" at the Sukhumi 
sanatorium owned by the Moscow Military District. 
  The sanatorium suffered virtually no damage during the 
two-years long war, although it is without water or light, like 
the rest of the city. A battalion of Russia's 345th Airborne 
Assault Regiment was stationed here all these months and, 
following unambiguous warnings, both warring sides were afraid 
to shoot at it. True enough, the UN men have brought along all 
their own equipment in addition to white Jeeps with blue "UN" 
insignia on the side and space communications stations -- 
including a power and water supply station and a computer 
installed in the general's office. 
  The general has been joined by 22 military observers. They 
are from Denmark, like the general, as well as from Bangladesh, 
Hungary, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the FRG. The 12 
civilian staffers come from Chile, the Dominican Republic, the 
United States, Canada, Belorussia [Belarus], and Trinidad and 
Tobago. The mission's purpose is to implement the UN mandate and 
monitor the observance of the cease-fire. Four of his officers 
are on the Georgian side, on the eastern bank of the Inguri 
River, the rest are here, on the western bank. 
  The general declined to tell me which of the sides is more 
to 
blame for breaching the cease-fire. "We report such information 
only to New York," he declared, but went on to add that his 
colleagues have filed complaints against both parties to the 
agreement signed in Geneva. 
  The general shows understanding for the Russian Army's 
peacemaking role in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. He thinks 
it only natural that the United Nations has not extended its 
mandate to our own military, does not pay for their peacekeeping 
operation, and has even refused permission to have their armored 
personnel carriers and vehicles painted in the white UN color. 
"The armed clash between Georgia and Abkhazia," Hvedegard said, 
"is an internal affair of the CIS, not of the United Nations." 

<H5>    June. Sukhumi. "Dead Season" </H5>
  The most powerful impression of Sukhumi was not produced by 
the city's burned down rayons, where flowering summer gardens 
and the clusters of bright red pomegranate and pink oleander 
cannot conceal the black shells and ruins of former luxury 
mansions and the gaping windows, here and there covered with 
plastic sheeting, of plundered multistory apartment blocks. As 
a matter of fact, no matter how cynical and bitter this may 
sound, you somehow -- unfortunately -- quickly get used to this 
in the course of official travel to the "hot spots." 
  You are no longer amazed -- no matter how painful the sight 
might be -- by the half-dead old men and women who stand for 
hours in line outside the bread stores or by the fierce clashes 
between them when the doors suddenly open and they see the tray 
with a dozen or so loaves for free distribution. The prices at 
local markets and stalls -- "dirt cheap" when compared with 
Russia -- appear normal and easy to comprehend. They are geared 
to local wages. 
  Seeing that a teacher or a physician earns 10,000 rubles 
[R] a month and a pensioner gets just R2,500 -- even though 
their money has not been paid for months -- paying R500 for 1 kg 
of medlar or an 0.5-liter jar of yogurt or R250 for a glass of 
"Izabella" does not seem all that cheap. The unemployment that 
has spread everywhere and the deserted streets and squares in 
the hot and generous subtropical city, which used to be merry 
and crowded with countless boarding houses, sanatoriums, small 
cafes, and restaurants, inspire no hope of an opportunity to 
earn something by trading. Even though brand new goods are 
hardly on sale here now. 
  It is perhaps this surprising lack of people in Sukhumi in 
June, its silent and deserted silken sand and pebble beaches, 
this "dead season" in the midst of the traditional festival of 
life, that creates the most vivid impression of the deserted 
southern city. 
  No shots are fired there today. Or rather, no shots are 
fired from mortars, artillery guns, and salvo-fire systems like 
the "Grad," but nobody would risk going out into the streets 
after 1800 hours. It is very easy to get hit by a stray bullet 
fired by someone of unknown nationality, wearing civilian 
clothes and carrying an assault rifle. 
  Indiscriminate banditry is the main problem in Sukhumi 
today. 
We are no longer talking about the looting of abandoned 
apartments, the theft of cars, or the division of war spoils -- 
people are robbed of their last possessions. 
  Aunt Lora, an elderly Russian woman standing in line for 
bread, who grew up in Sukhumi, told me how her neighbor -- an 
Abkhazian woman called Zhuzhana who can no longer walk because 
of old age and weakness -- had her home raided by 
"confederates," gunmen from the group of North Caucasian 
irregulars who have been given apartments formerly owned by 
Georgians fighting on the other side, who stole the canned food 
from her refrigerator. Nobody in the line disputed this fact or 
was amazed by it. 
  "Nothing unusual," I was told by an elderly Armenian wearing 
the ribbons of the "For Valor" and "For Victory over Germany" 
medals on his faded shirt. "There is nobody to protect us. Our 
children have either gone away or died on the border with 
Georgia, chaos rules here." 
  "Our republic's main problem," I was told by one of 
Abkhazia's leaders, "does not lie in mutual relations with 
Georgia, Russia, or the world community -- everything will get 
sorted out in time; but those who have experienced the power 
wielded by weapons, those who have risked their lives but in a 
couple of hours made more money that they would have done in 10 
years of hard labor plowing their field or garden, they will 
find it difficult to return to normal work." 
  The majority in Abkhazia pin their hopes on the Russian 
soldiers. Gali Mayor Ruslan Kishmariya told me that the 
deployment of peacemakers in their rayon would enable almost 
40,000 families of Mingrelian refugees to return home -- people 
who did not participate in the war but fled their homes in fear 
for their lives. 
  "We will not touch the innocents," he declared, "let them 
return to their land. But there is not and there never will be 
any room here for those who shot their Abkhazian brothers, those 
who burned and plundered their homes." 
  ...Through the four days of my official travel to Abkhazia I 
was accompanied by Paratrooper Valeriy Korotayev. He comes from 
the city of Votkinsk in Udmurtia, whose machine building plant 
produces the famous "Topol" strategic missiles. That is where 
his father works. 
  Valeriy is a strong guy, 1.80 meters tall, straw-blond, and 
always ready to smile; he has been serving with the airborne 
assault troops for six months now, completed his training in 
Omsk to qualify as driver of a BMD-3 fighting vehicle. This is 
his first month with the 345th Regiment. He likes it very much 
here, even though he admitted to me that for the last week he 
had never taken off his 12-kg bulletproof vest, he never got the 
chance. He even got a suntan in it. 
  He has not yet written to his parents to tell them he is in 
the Abkhazian "hot spot," he does not want to worry them, but he 
has hinted as much to his 17-year old younger brother. But he 
did give me permission -- if I somehow managed to work it into 
my report -- to tell his father and mother that in the fall, 
when the fruit harvest where will be plentiful, he intends to go 
on leave and take them some gifts.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Estonian Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs in Tallinn on 21 June -- received via Internet E-LIST] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry of Estonia received with deep 
concern the announcement about the June 21, 1994 Russian 
Federation presidential decree, "Demarcation of the Border 
Between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Estonia" 
which arrived via mass media. The Russian Federation did not 
find it necessary to inform Estonia about this step through 
diplomatic channels. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Russia's unilateral 
decision was made at a time when, pursuant to the decision made 
at the May meeting between the President of the Republic of 
Estonia Lennart Meri, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, a new impetus has been 
given to the finding of solutions to on-going problems in 
bi-lateral relations. 
  In the framework of the Estonian-Russian negotiations, 
within 
the working group on border issues, Estonia has steadfastly 
sought solutions, including the creation of a legal basis for 
the operations of the border guards. In the international 
arena, Estonia has repeatedly presented initiatives to deal with 
border- related differences of opinion with the Russian 
Federation: last February Estonia proposed the naming of a 
special representative of the Chairman of the CSCE, Estonia has 
repeatedly offered to take the matter to the International Court 
in the Hague, likewise, Estonia has proposed discussing the 
border problem with Russia in the framework of the European 
Stability Pact. 
  The only treaty in force which sets the border between the 
Republic of Estonia and the Russian Federation is the 1920 Peace 
Treaty of Tartu which the "National Border Book Between the 
Estonian Democratic Republic and the Russian Socialist Federal 
Soviet Republic records. The 1940 Soviet occupation of Estonia 
did not affect the validity of this treaty. The August 24, 1991 
Russian presidential decree in principle recognizes the legal 
continuity of Estonia. 
  Russia's decision to unilaterally demarcate the border "in 
the political and economic interests of the Russian Federation" 
clearly violates the charter of the UN as well as CSCE 
principles to resolve matters of dispute through negotiations, 
without unilateral actions and without the use or the threat of 
force. 
  The carrying out of the the Russian presidential decree 
under 
the current conditions would mean that, without the consent of 
the other nation, one nation selects and proclaims an arbitrary 
line to be the border between two nations. A line whose 
delineation is not mutually agreed upon cannot be made a 
national border. 
  In the complicated situation which has developed, the 
Republic of Estonia reaffirms its willingness to solve the 
question of the national border with Russia at the negotiating 
table and calls upon Russia to forego all kinds of unilateral 
actions in these questions. 
  The June 21, 1994 Russian presidential decree on unilateral 
actions regarding the national border with Estonia leaves the 
impression that the Russian Federation is not interested in the 
normalization of relations with Estonia.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The Estonian authorities 
learned of today's edict by Boris Yeltsin from the mass media. 
Raul Malk, vice chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Ministry, 
told our radio station that the text of the decree had not been 
conveyed to Tallinn by diplomatic channels. 
  [Begin Malk recording] The implementation of the 
presidential 
edict would signify, in present conditions, that one state 
thinks up some line, and without agreement with the other side 
declares it as the state border of the two states. The state 
border cannot be established unless its line is agreed with the 
other side. Today's decree on a unilateral act in matters of 
the state frontier with Estonia gives the impression that when 
all is said and done, such is Russia's interest in the 
normalization of relations with Estonia overall. [end recording]

  [Text] Tallinn, June 21, RIA-BNS -- "I don't believe U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to Riga is likely to 
speed up the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia," 
Estonian President Lennart Meri said in an interview with the 
Russian RIA news agency. 
  In the president's opinion, the Russian leadership has long 
ago adopted a political decision in this question. "It would be 
incorrect on my part to consider President Clinton's visit to 
Riga as putting pressure on the world power called the Russian 
Federation," Meri emphasized. 
  Clinton is going to pay July 6 a six-hour visit to the 
Latvian capital, Riga, during which he is scheduled to meet with 
Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis and his Estonian and Lithuanian 
counterparts, Meri and Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  Estonian Ambassador to the United States Toomas Hendrik 
Ilves 
told BNS Clinton had first mentioned his wish to visit the 
Baltic states last September when he met with the three Baltic 
presidents in New York. 
  White House officials unfortunately dropped Estonia from 
Clinton's schedule after familiarizing themselves with the 
blueprints of the Tallinn Airport: the airfield didn't have a 
runway long enough to receive Air Force One.

  [Text] Today in Riga, the Saeima Committee on Defense and 
Internal Affairs and Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis met the 
members of the Swedish Parliament's Defense Committee, who are 
currently acquainting themselves with the work of their 
colleagues in the Baltic countries. The Swedish colleagues were 
interested in Latvia's military doctrine, the national armed 
forces structures, the relationship between the Home Guard and 
the defense forces, the problems of guarding the borders, and 
women's role in the creation of defense policy. 
  Yesterday, the members of the Swedish parliamentary Defense 
Committee visited Lithuania; tomorrow, they arrive in Estonia. 
  It should be noted that this is the first instance since the 
declaration of Latvian independence that the full complement of 
another country's parliamentary commission has visited Latvia.

  [Excerpts] The citizenship bill was debated in the Latvian 
Saeima today on its third reading. As expected, the debate was 
primarily devoted to Clause 14, which regulates the general 
arrangements for the naturalization of non-citizens. [passage 
omitted] 
  The quota principle could be an obstacle to admission to the 
Council of Europe. This was pointed out in a speech by Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs. In a secret ballot, this quota was 
removed from the law by majority vote. Thereby, the Saeima this 
evening accepted the law on citizenship. The voting in the 
secret ballot was: 66 deputies for; 11 against; three 
abstentions.

<F P=106> [Report by Veronika Kutsyllo: "Operations Department </F>
Created in the Apparatus"] 
  [Text] Under a series of edicts signed Monday by Boris 
Yeltsin, Nikolay Medvedev has been replaced by Aleksandr Kazakov 
as chief of the Presidential Staff Administration for Work With 
Territories; Vladimir Zaytsev, first deputy chief of the Control 
Administration, has been appointed acting chief of this 
administration; Vladimir Varov has become Russia's chief labor 
inspector; and finally an Operations [operativnyy] Department 
has been created in the staff itself. 
  Apparently the presidential "reshuffle" edicts should not be 
scrutinized for signs of just another apparatus overhaul. Some 
of them were prepared long ago: For instance, Vladimir 
Zaytsev's appointment as Russia's chief controller or Vladimir 
Varov's nomination as the country's chief labor inspector. It 
is not yet clear exactly what the Russian Federal Labor 
Inspectorate will do: Whether Varov will be tasked with 
verifying the correct maintenance of work record books or 
whether he will conduct on-site checks at enterprises. But it 
would be unreasonable to expect any serious changes in Russian 
politics as a result of this appointment. 
  That Nikolay Medvedev's days as chief of the Administration 
for Work With Territories were numbered has been known for a 
long time. Having failed to establish proper contacts with the 
regions, Medvedev, after the March reorganization of the staff, 
was not confirmed as administration chief and has remained 
acting head throughout this time. His departure was inevitable 
and did not evoke any protest either from the administration's 
staff or from deputies of parliament's upper chamber: heads of 
the regions. Commenting at KOMMERSANT-DAILY's request on 
Medvedev's fate, a member of the Federation Council leadership 
observed "It is high time," while another crossed himself. 
  Therefore the only surprise was the appointment to this post 
of Aleksandr Kazakov rather than any of the regional aspirants. 
Before the edict Kazakov worked in the government as Anatoliy 
Chubays' deputy. True, according to comments from his 
colleagues, the new administration chief dealt with 
privatization mainly "in the regional sphere" and therefore is 
well acquainted with regional problems. Nonetheless, he will 
clearly take a long time to restore the administration's 
reputation in the eyes of the regional rulers. 
  Perhaps the most mysterious of these edicts was the decision 
to create in the staff an Operations Department which, according 
to the official version, will be responsible for processing 
incoming and outgoing presidential documents. The name of the 
candidate for the post of the president's chief operations 
officer is not being disclosed yet. Until recently all 
paperwork has been handled by the President's Chancellery, 
headed by Valeriy Semenchenko. No one in the Presidential Staff 
could explain yesterday what exactly will happen now: Whether 
Semenchenko will have his hands freed to deal with other 
presidential affairs or whether, quite the contrary, he has been 
sidelined. 
<H5>  From the Statute on the Administration for Work With </H5>
Territories 
  The administration's tasks include ensuring interaction 
between the president and the bodies of state power and 
administration in the republics, krays, oblasts, autonomous 
oblasts, autonomous districts, and the cities of Moscow and St. 
Petersburg 
<H5>  Commentary by Federation Council Deputy Chairman Ramazan </H5>
Abdulatipov 
  "I do not understand what the administration does. It is not 
clear whether it is supposed to brief the president about what 
is going on in the regions, or coordinate the activity of 
various departments, or convey federal government decisions to 
the regions. The administration's status and powers have not 
been defined."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Shcherban] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- A leader of the abortive 
Soviet coup of 1991 insisted on Wednesday that former Soviet 
President Mikhail Gorbachev was ill at the time. 
  "In August 1991 Mikhail Gorbachev was badly ill both in the 
physical and morally-psychologic aspects," former Soviet Deputy 
Defence Minister Valentin Varennikov told the trial on Wednesday. 
  Varennikov is the only coup organiser who rejected the 
Duma-proclaimed amnesty and insisted that his case be 
investigated by court. 
  Gorbachev's alleged illness was used by the coup plotters to 
explain the isolation of the president. Gorbachev himself had 
rejected the allegations. 
  Varennikov admitted that communications with the state 
residence in Foros in the Crimea where Gorbachev was staying had 
been cut off, but explained it by the desire not to disturb the 
president during his talks with the coup plotters. 
  "Constant calls could have distracted Gorbachev" from talks 
with the ringleaders who arrived to Foros to get a go-ahead from 
the president for the introduction of a state of emergency in 
the country. 
  Varennikov rejected the accusation that the communications 
had been cut off to isolate Gorbachev.

  [Text] Moscow, 21 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- A party with an 
unusual name -- "Lefsha" [left-hander] -- has been registered at 
Russia's Justice Ministry. Dmitriy Semenov, the president of 
the new political association, told ITAR-TASS that: The party 
intends to defend the interests of qualified wage labor workers. 
It consists of qualified industrial and agricultural workers, 
scientific-technical and cultural intelligentsia, students, and 
professional military. 
  We are for forming a middle class in Russia, which, as is 
known, consists not only of medium and small owners but what is 
more important, of qualified and highly-paid workers, the 
party's president said. 
  In keeping with its program, the party will seek to gain 
power constitutionally, in order to carry out a realistic reform 
in the interests of wage labor workers. The aim of the party is 
a legislative reform of social and labor relations. 
  The party has started preparations for its nationwide 
congress, which is to take place at the end of 
September-beginning of October 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Yegor Gaydar, former Russian prime minister, now </F>
a member of the democratic opposition to Boris Yeltsin: "The 
Real Fascist Threat in Russia"] 
  [Text] Did the chaos of 4 October 1993 suffice to open a 
period of calm, however precarious, in Russia? And if a crisis 
arose, who would benefit from it? In all hypothetical cases, we 
find the sinister "brown factor," without which a major 
political accident is unlikely, although fascism (hard or soft, 
brown or red- brown) would be the death of Russia, a disaster 
equal to that of 1917. The events on 3 and 4 October were a 
warning. Before that, who could have believed that the legal or 
even legalist opposition would hold out its hand to avowed 
Nazis, to Barkashov's gangsters (Footnote) (Aleksandr Barkashov, 
41 years old, is the leader of the neo-Nazi Russian National 
Unity Party, which has a militarized group of party stewards)? 
Worse still that it would arm them? And yet that is what 
Khazbulatov, Rutskoy, and the Supreme Soviet did. In a time of 
crisis, in the name of the government, they thought they could 
form an alliance with the Nazis, and adopt their methods. This 
is the decisive political lesson of the present time.... 
  This alliance was seen once again on 12 May during the 
meeting held by the newspaper ZAVTRA (Tomorrow), the organ of 
the "radical" opposition, for the launch of the Accord for 
Russia bloc. Rutskoy, Zorkin, and Baburin warmly applauded 
Barkashov's opening speech. The passionate support of the fringe 
elements was backed up by that of part of the country's 
political establishment, leaders of the parliamentary 
opposition. On the one side are deputies, chosen by legal 
ballot, and on the other are fringe elements and Nazis.... Of 
course, the avowed Nazis have little influence and, at first 
sight, are the "younger brothers" of the alliance. Seen more 
closely, however, they are its driving force. This paradox can 
be explained by the ideological poverty of the moderate 
nationalists. Despite their statements on "enlightened 
patriotism," they have never been able to define this concept 
which, all-in-all, is merely a chocolate filled with red-brown 
rum. On the other hand, the Nazis do have an ideology. Their 
watchwords are criminal and stupid, but clear. All the 
nationalist patriots can do is kneel at the polished boots of 
the Barkashov militias. 
  Nazism is a malignant mutation of nationalism. National 
egoism is as natural as individual egoism. It only becomes 
aggressive if a feeling of frustration and injustice is added to 
it. Weimar's Germany is an example of this. The same feeling 
of lost empire exists in Russia today. 
  The fall of Communism created an ideological vacuum which 
the 
values of the "consumer society" do not fill. They are an 
insult to a whole mass of people, like an advertisement for 
unobtainable products. It is at this level that nationalism 
comes in. The consumerist frustration is "sublimated" in 
national frustration, which gives it dignity and turns it into 
an ideology, gives it a spiritual dimension. The social and 
national frustrations come together producing what is called 
national-socialism. Remarks made by ordinary people, such as 
"the Caucasians are taking everything," are turned into ideas, 
producing "the universal plot against Russia is trying to turn 
it into a colony of Western, American, or Zionist capitalism." 
Even if racism proper is rare in Russia, this ideology plays on 
national and/or social prejudices. 
  Behind this madness are real problems. As elsewhere, we have 
an ethnically structured Mafia (in addition to the Russian Mafia 
proper). On the world markets, there is a merciless struggle. 
Some circles are openly hostile to Russia and are seeking to 
isolate it. There is nothing surprising or horrible about that. 
  Why has Russian society proved more vulnerable than others 
to 
the action of the red-brown killer bugs? Have our social 
structure and our history predisposed us to totalitarianism? 
  In Central Europe, the totalitarianism imposed by our tanks 
collapsed once our tanks left. In our country, totalitarianism 
has been imposed in an endogenic way, produced by our society 
and our history. In our past, the aspiration to freedom and the 
rejection of freedom were tragically and indissolubly linked. 
Bolshevik totalitarianism inherited the autocracy it sought to 
destroy and carried it to its extreme logical conclusion. The 
Cheka shot the Black Hundreds but it was their spiritual 
daughter which surpassed its parents. Another example of the 
tragic interweaving of the terms of our historical conflict was 
the wartime watchword: "For the Fatherland, for Stalin." This 
slogan was developed to become: "For the Fatherland, and for 
Stalin which is its executioner." Our tragic history weighs 
heavily on the nation's memory and opposes the emergence of a 
rational and moderate conservatism. What national values to be 
defended could a Russian conservatism include in its program? 
Civilian society? The autonomy of the individual in face of 
the state? Private property? Yes, all these values exist in 
our country, but only in an embryonic state. Thus Russian 
conservatism is sliding, by inertia, toward the "cult of 
autocracy" and the "policy of the big stick." 
  And yet, a healthy society must have a strong conservative 
pole, because that is the most effective curb to keep 
nationalism within reasonable limits. This healthy Russian 
nationalism, which would be based on the Russian people's civic 
rights and on their inalienable right to private property, does 
not yet exist. We intend to build it if social circumstances 
permit. 
  The structure of society is even more important than the 
psychological traditions. The totalitarian regime has been 
knocked out but is still standing. The economy is still 
militarized. The bureaucratic oligarchy still holds the 
economic and political power. It persists in its desire to 
return to the past. 
  The ultimate foundation of a society is formed by relations 
of ownership and we are still resolving this historical problem 
for Russia. The move toward capitalism is now irreversible. 
The problem is whether we want a bureaucratic capitalism or a 
democratic capitalism. If we opt for the bureaucratic-state 
option, we are condemning ourselves to stagnation and Russia 
will merely be a semicolonial supplier of raw materials. This 
brings us back to the famous "plot against Russia." It is not 
the "Masonic lodges" which are hatching it, but our own 
bureaucratic elite in the name of its so-called "sense of state" 
(but this is a semicolonial state). 
  The bureaucracy has kept the bulk of the power, particularly 
in the provinces. Its only interest is to maintain it. Like 
all the rich, bureaucrats are cautious and fear extremes. That 
does not prevent them from talking with the Nazis, just in case. 
  Is it possible that they will opt for the Nazi alliance, 
thinking that they are "hiring gangsters to serve them," like 
the Weimar Republic on the eve of its fall? 
  Only an alliance with the most aggressive party of the 
bureaucratic bourgeoisie can pave the way to power for the 
Nazis. Such an alliance was formed in October 1993 with Rutskoy, 
Khazbulatov, and other members of the former Supreme Soviet. 
Let us now imagine a mutation on a bigger scale, and we will 
see the scale of the resulting political disaster. 
  Fascism in Russia is only possible in the form of a 
dictatorship exercised by the most aggressive sections of the 
parasitic "bureaucratic bourgeoisie." The alliance between this 
bourgeoisie and the Nazis is the main danger which we have to 
combat. Compared with the fashionable hopes in an "enlightened 
authoritarianism," my position is clear: There can only be a 
"good dictatorship" for those who would live happily even with a 
bad one. 
  We must counter the possible alliance of the bureaucrats and 
Nazis with our own alliance of democrats and the liberal 
bourgeoisie, while neutralizing the most influential sectors of 
the bureaucracy and, consequently, safeguarding their interests. 
  Of course, our interests are opposed to those of the 
bureaucracy: We are in favor of developing the market economy, 
eliminating the control of the bureaucratic oligarchy over the 
economy. But, out of principle, we are opposed to a fight to 
the death. We only envisage such a struggle as necessary and 
inevitable against the Nazis, and we only mean the term "death" 
in the political sense. Faced with the bureaucracy and the 
bourgeoisie linked to it, we are still ready to seek a 
compromise and pursue our policy so as never to force them into 
a corner. The essential thing is to avoid an alliance within 
which, for the bureaucracy, the Nazis are seen as the "lesser 
evil." 
  The whole of Russian history shows that, for a coup d'etat 
to 
be possible, a situation of dual power is necessary, as was the 
case in 1917, in August 1991, and in October 1993. The 
democratic forces must therefore ensure that they never allow 
such a situation to arise again. 
  We show our support for Russia's national interests by 
seeking to ensure that every Russian citizen can have a normal 
and dignified life, whereas the "nationalists" gauge their 
patriotism by the yardstick of their hatred of non-Russians, or 
even with the help of the compasses used to measure the 
thickness of non-Aryan skulls. We have more of a sense of the 
fatherland and state than they do and we express this by 
trusting the people and telling them the truth. 
  Our dignity lies in our reason. And it is in the light of 
reason that specters vanish, including the specter of Nazism 
which is trying to terrorize our fatherland.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.V. Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the </F>
Central Electoral Commission, by Valentin Maslennikov; place and 
date of interview not stated: "Will We Manage Without Party 
Distortions?"] 
  [Text] The draft law on the basic guarantees of Russian 
Federation citizens' electoral rights has undergone approbation 
in the State Duma committees. Soon it will be submitted to a 
plenary session of parliament's lower chamber. What is its 
importance and topicality? This question is answered by A.V. 
Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission. 
  [Ivanchenko] We are waiting impatiently for the draft to 
acquire the force of law. It is the first in a series of 
electoral laws which open up a new stage in the reform of the 
entire electoral system as a whole. On its basis the laws of 
the Federation components on elections of representative and 
executive organs of power and local self-management will be 
adopted. The precise demarcation of the powers of federal and 
regional legislators essentially begins with this draft. The 
hands of representatives of power locally are untied. And our 
law here will guarantee that no one can encroach on the very 
important right of the citizen to elect and be elected. 
  The adoption of this law is awaited by the newly elected 
authorities in the Federation's components. When the law 
appears they will have a guarantee of the stability of their 
existence. 
  [Maslennikov] Whose was the initiative to adopt this law? 
  [Ivanchenko] It was the initiative of the State Duma 
committees for the affairs of the Federation and regional 
policy, for legislation and court and legal reform, and for 
questions of local self-management. It was they who were the 
first to voice their concern at the course of the elections in 
the regions. It was at their insistence that the Duma adopted 
the decree in which it suggested that the president prepare a 
draft of this law as a priority and submit it for its 
examination. 
  To prepare the law a joint commission was created, which 
elaborated this draft. It included deputies of the State Duma 
and Federal Council, and representatives of the Central 
Electoral Commission and leading scientific institutions. The 
draft was discussed beforehand in local areas, in particular in 
Kaluga, Astrakhan, and Khabarovsk. It was approved at 
seminar-conferences which we have been holding. During this 
work changes and amplifications were made to it. A number of 
articles were radically reworked. In my view it is now in a 
high degree of readiness. 
  [Maslennikov] Does the draft law really no longer contain 
any contradictions which could give rise to deputies' objections 
or disagreement? 
  [Ivanchenko] That is something which probably never happens 
in lawmaking practice. Although the absolute majority of 
members of the conciliation commission support the completed 
draft law. 
  We are embarrassed by considerations of a different order, 
to 
be more precise the very fierce party allegiances of some 
deputies. Thus, for instance, Deputy V. Sheynis (an active 
developer of this draft, incidentally) has recently started to 
encroach on the procedure for forming the electoral commissions 
proposed in the future law. The present version provides for 
equal participation in the appointment of the Central Electoral 
Commission chairman and his deputy and the commission's 
secretary and members by the president, Federation Council, 
State Duma, and components of the Federation. In particular the 
State Duma makes nominations put forward by the deputies' 
factions and groups. 
  But Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis is inclined exclusively 
toward the party principle for forming commissions. I think he 
knows full well where this can lead, particularly locally. 
Instead of a precisely operating commission at best we shall 
get a debating club. In addition so far our multiparty system 
is making itself felt more in Moscow but by no means in outlying 
districts. There, with a party approach toward the formation of 
commissions, there will probably be organs incapable of working. 
Practice shows that electoral commissions locally have no taste 
for debates so they must unfailingly be built on a balance of 
interests of both representative and executive power. 
Artificially imposing a multiparty system from above is fraught 
with the danger of adverse consequences. The equal rights of 
the candidates will be cancelled out and the interests of voters 
in single-seat districts will be well and truly ignored. A 
distortion in the direction of a party bias will unfailingly 
result in an encroachment on the interests of independent voters 
and their candidates. 
  The commissions created on the party principle will not be 
able to be objective. The legislator must create real and equal 
guarantees for the rights of voters and candidates and not 
resurrect the monopoly of any party. 
  [Maslennikov] Voters have had many complaints against the 
electoral commissions which obviously delayed the summing up of 
election results.... 
  [Ivanchenko] That is not their fault. Nor is it the fault 
of the Central Electoral Commission. The statute on the 1993 
elections to the benefit of the capital's party interests 
excluded from the process of counting votes on party lists not 
only the rayon and city but also the oblast and kray levels of 
electoral commissions. And over 100,000 electoral commissions' 
protocols were taken to Moscow by couriers. Disrespect and 
distrust was shown toward the regions and the summing up of the 
results was delayed. In the new law we have striven to avoid 
blunders of this nature. 
  [Maslennikov] Is there certainty that the law will be 
adopted immediately at the first reading? 
  [Ivanchenko] The enormous volume of work done in advance in 
the Duma committees permits us to hope so. In addition both the 
president and the deputies themselves are interested in the law 
on basic guarantees of voters' rights beginning to operate as 
soon as possible.

  [Text] The first large Russian industrial enterprises have 
been entered on the state register of insolvency. The list of 
enterprises was drawn up by the Russian Committee on 
Machine-Building. About 40 plants were registered. These 
crisis-ridden plants are unable to pay taxes, settle up with 
suppliers of raw materials, or pay wages. These enterprises 
will now have to change the way they run their business or else 
acknowledge their insolvency and go into voluntary 
self-liquidation.

<F P=106> [Marat Salimov report: "The Regions Have Created an Oil </F>
Cartel"] 
  [Text] The Association for Economic Interaction of Russian 
Oil and Gas Producing Regions yesterday approved its charter. 
The oil and gas union sets some fairly ambitions goals. They 
include the upholding of sectoral interests within the country 
and moving towards OPEC on the foreign market. 
  Although there were original fears that the creation of the 
Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas 
Producing Regions could be hindered by the contradictions which 
exist between the regions, a decision to form it was made after 
all. The new association's weight is enhanced by the fact that 
Fuel and Energy Ministry Yuriy Shafranik has been elected its 
president for a year. Therefore the association has ensured 
itself direct access to the prime minister and the president, 
which is a direct prerequisite for successful lobbying activity. 
According to the association's initiators -- deputies from oil 
producing regions and directors of fuel and energy enterprises 
-- the organization will make it possible to actively stand up 
to the budget favorites of the legislative bodies and the 
government: the agrarian sector and the social sphere. Although 
it is an open secret that the fuel and energy complex is the 
milk cow for both these sectors of the national economy as well 
as for the state sector, ensuring 60 percent of Russian exports 
and 40 percent of hard currency budget revenues: With needs of 
7.1 trillion rubles, it has received 1.1 trillion in state 
investments. 
  However, apart from the functions traditional for such 
associations (getting money from the budget), the association is 
laying claim to something more. Under its charter, in addition 
to direct influence on state economic policy in the energy 
sphere, its tasks include coordination of the regions' activity 
in producing, processing, pricing, and marketing oil and gas 
products. The possibilities for performing these functions are 
ensured by the association's composition, which includes 
representatives of Russia's major oil and gas producing regions: 
Tyumen, Tomsk, Orenburg, and Sakha Oblasts, Khanty-Mansi and 
Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugs, and the republics of Bashkiria, 
Komi, and Tatarstan. 
  Therefore in the event that agreement is reached between the 
regions, the association will be able to set monopoly prices for 
oil and gas products both on the domestic and the CIS market. 
The essence of its lobbying activity in the Federal Assembly 
and the government will be to make sure that in the absence of 
requisite budgetary support, no antimonopoly sanctions are 
applied against the sector's enterprises. The rationale behind 
the pricing activity can be very simple: The oil and gas 
complex has to resolve its financial problems with available 
market methods, and price control is a forced measure. Besides, 
the association will have a chance to join the well-known OPEC 
cartel, which establishes world oil prices, as a nongovernment 
organization. The association's charter says directly that at 
the first stage the task is to ensure participation in OPEC as 
an observer. In the event that OPEC membership is secured, 
Russian regions will have guaranteed access to the world market 
and will therefore not need to maintain the volume of export 
deliveries at the expense of price concessions. So, the 
Association for Economic Interaction of Russian Oil and Gas 
Producing Regions presumably can become the first Russian oil 
cartel with all the inherent functions.

  [Text] To all appearances the country is no longer 
threatened by miners' strikes caused by the nonpayments crisis. 
The specialists from the Russian Coal and Raw Material Mutual 
[sovmestnyy] Bank have found a way out of the apparent deadlock. 
  The first "industrial experiment" has already shown the high 
degree of effectiveness of the decisions which have been found. 
A financial chain linked the "Vorkutaugol" association, the 
Novyy Lipetsk metallurgical combine, the Vyksa pipe welders, 
and the transport workers and oil extraction workers. A 
clearing accounts procedure has been developed for each 
enterprise. 
  Nonetheless it is still too early to rejoice. The country is 
in acute need of modern financial legislation. 
  A realistic way out of the situation is the creation of 
financial and industrial groups. In the coal industry this 
process has already begun. In the opinion of specialists, the 
profitability of "buying and selling" operations is receding 
into the past. Life has shown that the future of the economy 
and its normalization belong to the producers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Taxes: Game of Hide and Seek"] </F>
  [Text] There has been a tax collection shortfall of around 
10 percent this year. The lower chamber of parliament was 
informed of this by Vladimir Gusev, leader of the State Taxation 
Service. The basic reason for this, according to him, is the 
nonpayments crisis and numerous cases of tax evasion. 
  Briefing deputies on progress in fulfilling the Russian 
President's Edict "On the Implementation of a Tax Amnesty in 
1993," Vladimir Gusev noted that nonpayment of taxes has 
essentially become widespread. He cited the following figures: 
Since the presidential edict came into force 44,000 corporate 
bodies and 2,000 individuals guilty of ignoring tax legislation 
have been detected. As a result the exchequer has experienced a 
shortfall of 350 billion rubles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank of Russia Chairman Viktor </F>
Gerashchenko by Vladimir Katin, RIA correspondent at the EC, in 
Luxembourg "last week," specially for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA; 
carried under the "Finances" rubric: "Viktor Gerashchenko 
Favors Giving Foreign Banks Measured Access to Russia. The 
Central Bank as an Ultra-Patriot of the Russian Banking System"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg is home to more than 200 foreign banks 
from all over the world. Billion-dollar operations take place 
here every day, and the financial powers that be are frequent 
guests in this city. Viktor Gerashchenko, chief of the Central 
Bank of Russia, who was in Luxembourg last week, answered 
questions concerning the admission of foreign banks to the 
country's financial market. 
  [Katin] State protectionism of the banking sector in Russia 
is one of the obstacles that prevent our country from forging 
partnership relations with European business. This obstacle has 
also long held up the conclusion of an agreement on trade 
cooperation with the EC. But recently a shift has emerged in 
which foreign financial institutions seem to be given 
significant concessions that appear to be coming from you 
personally, the Central Bank. Is this really so and what do you 
think about that? 
  [Gerashchenko] Let us first, so to speak, take a glimpse at 
the overall picture of banking activity in Russia. In my view, 
the way the banking sector is currently developing is not bad, 
it is even doing well. I absolutely disagree with those who say 
that we already have more banks than we need. At present there 
are approximately 2,100 banks in the country. Plus 600 
applications to open new ones. Given that in addition they have 
4,500 branches strewn over the country, it will make over 6,000 
banking units. Still, I cannot say that this is enough, that the 
banking system has covered all areas, has penetrated all 
capillaries of society and the economy. One reason for such an 
unsatisfactory -- so far -- status is the overconcentration of 
banks in one place -- Moscow, which accounts for around 38-40 
percent of all banks. This, however, is normal, this is a 
tradition for large cities in all countries, all the more so for 
capital cities. 
  So, the current banking system, despite its clear trend 
toward evolution, toward expansion, alas, still is not fully 
capable of servicing small and medium-size businesses. In 
addition, national banks sometimes try to call the shots. That 
is, they attach fairly tight or expensive conditions to their 
loans or when carrying out one transaction or another. 
  Now we are faced with the need to give foreign banks access 
to the Russian financial market. I would like to underline, 
however, that this access should be measured. The evolution of 
the entire modern banking system in the world, where each 
country sooner or later arrives at this particular decision, 
speaks in favor of opening national borders for foreign banks. 
There was a time where the Spaniards, the Australians, or the 
Dutch did not let in foreign banking capital, but in the end all 
of them have changed their approach. 
  [Katin] What is the reason for such a shift in some 
countries and such an interest in others? 
  [Gerashchenko] When a foreign banks appears in an unfamiliar 
country that may be even unknown to its traditional customers, 
it helps them, first, to invest their money in its economy in 
the best possible fashion. Second, the bank helps create an 
international climate in interbank cooperation. This has a 
direct bearing on Russia. If we are seriously and actively to 
take part in the international division of labor, to become an 
inalienable part of the world economy, and to enter the world 
market, we cannot do without cooperating with the banking system 
on an international scale. You cannot but agree that it would 
be simply ridiculous and naive to reason as follows: Yes, we 
will pass a law on foreign investment and agree to give it 
access to industrial production, trade, mediation services, but 
it will be not allowed in the banking sector, no way! All these 
things are organically intertwined, after all. Doubtless, we 
should not admit all the -- excuse the phrase -- riff-raff only 
to have problems with them afterward. This is precisely why we 
need measured access. 
  [Katin] Will you please expand on this principle: How 
should this formula be applied in practice? 
  [Gerashchenko] The situation is as follows. Under current 
Russian legislation, the admission of foreign banks falls under 
the jurisdiction of the Central Bank, which sets a measure or a 
quota for foreign banking capital on Russia's financial market. 
Recently, in accordance with our powers we made a decision that 
the capital of foreign banks that will receive licenses from us 
to operate in Russia may not exceed 12-15 percent of the overall 
capital of national banks put together. This is one side to the 
problem. Another principle of the measured access formula is 
our right to select those who will be best suited to operate on 
the Russian financial market. We will choose what they call the 
first- class names -- the most respectable banks that can really 
help their customers invest their money in the development of 
the Russian economy. Let us imagine the following situation. 
Say, a foreign bank has had a mission in Russia for 10-15 
years, and its exposure to Russia stands at $1 billion. This is 
our state foreign debt that we are for the time being unable to 
repay on time and so we are negotiating its rescheduling. So 
why shouldn't we allow such a bank to have its office here, in 
Moscow, to do its business, its wheeling and dealing, as the 
saying goes? In this case, the frozen portfolio of Russian 
assets will look entirely different to the bank's shareholders. 
A psychological factor will also be at work -- there will be a 
rising tide of confidence. 
  [Katin] In your account the Central Bank of Russia's stance 
appears fairly clear and convincing. What do the chiefs of the 
numerous private banks that you referred to at the beginning of 
our conversation think about the prospective arrival of foreign 
banking capital in Russia? 
  [Gerashchenko] I will say this: When our commercial banks 
say that giving access to foreigners amounts to selling out, 
they are for the most part guided by parochial interests. They 
simply do not want healthy competition, that is it. No, we do 
not call for the Russian sector of commercial banks to be 
stifled with help from foreigners, just the opposite, we want to 
give the banking sector a boost! I want to take the opportunity 
to state through NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: We, the Central Bank of 
Russia, in this sense are even ultra-patriots of the development 
of a serious banking system in our country. Who is crying and 
protesting loudest against foreign banks? It is mostly the 
small Russian banks and those who are not involved in long-term 
economic development. In doing their business, they are ready 
to give loans at huge rates while giving no thought at all to 
what this loan will be spent on. 
  [Katin] I would like to hear your opinion on the 
astronomical interest rates offered by some of our banks to 
their customers, such as "We guarantee 1,000 percent on ruble 
and hard-currency deposits!" I hope you are aware of such 
advertisements, you read our press after all. What is it -- 
swindling? 
  [Gerashchenko] Yes, I read our press, and sometimes I even 
watch television. I believe that these advertisements are made 
by organizations that are unscrupulous or not entirely 
comprehensible to me. I wonder from whom they could obtain 
licenses for their activity, without which it is prohibited to 
attract people's money for any operations. Only the Central 
Bank or the Finance Ministry is entitled to issue such licenses. 
Admittedly, we still have lots of twilight zones whose activity 
is not covered by law -- that is the problem. In short, I would 
not rush to an institution that offers 1,000 percent on a 
deposit. 
  [Katin] How do you, from the standpoint of your post as the 
country's chief banker, assess the ruble's health? 
  [Gerashchenko] In my view, our ruble is a completely healthy 
currency. This can be proved, for instance, by the following 
fact: Many people no longer buy foreign currency to save their 
rubles from inflation, but place their money at Russian banks 
precisely on ruble deposits. Yes, the ruble exchange rate is 
declining, this is a normal phenomenon given the current 
inflation, but it is far from a tragedy. In addition, it is 
declining much more slowly than exporters, who are interested in 
this decline, would like it to.

  [Text] The staff of the State Customs Committee released 
the first currency control figures relating to the return of 
proceeds from the export of Russian goods. In the last three 
months the total volume of currency retained by exporting 
organizations rather than handed over is $70 million. A total 
of 40 organizations are among the guilty ones. But according to 
observers, the volume of currency which has not been handed over 
in detected cases may seem paltry compared with the amounts of 
currency which simply disappear. One wonders whether the control 
mechanisms introduced are effective.

  [Text] The Russian president's Commission on the Affairs

Chairman Yekaterina Lyakhova delivered a report "On the Status

  The report noted, in particular, that as of 1 January 1994 
Russia had a population of 148.4 million people, that is, the 
Russian population has declined by nearly 1 million from 1992. 
Mortality has exceeded birth rate. 
  The author attributed this to the worsening of Russian 
families' social situation. For instance, the new system of 
child benefits introduced in January 1994 does not ensure even a 
level of benefits comparable with that of January 1991.

<F P=106> [Report by Senior Lieutenant Sergey Kolesnikov and Senior </F>
Lieutenant Andrey Rodnov of Russian MVD Internal Troops Press 
Center: "ODON Simply an `Excellent Division'"] 
  [Text] The Separate Operational Division [Otdelnaya 
diviziya operativnogo naznacheniya -- ODON] of the Russian MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] Internal Troops has celebrated 
its 70th anniversary. Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
participated in the festivities. 
  This was the second visit to the combined unit in the past 
year by the supreme commander in chief of the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces. It is not hard to notice that at critical moments 
the country's leadership turns precisely to this division. This 
time, too, the president's itinerary had evidently not been 
chosen by chance. The country has been overwhelmed by crime 
whose scale is frightening people, but at all stages of its 
existence the elite combined unit of internal troops has been a 
stabilizing factor in Russian reality and a weighty guarantor of 
citizens' safety. According to Boris Yeltsin, crime in the 
country has reached a dangerous level and is reducing to naught 
the results of many transformations, and effective protection 
against the criminal onslaught is needed. The country's 
leadership sees just this as the main task of the combined unit 
and of the internal troops as a whole. 
  It should be pointed out that the division has already 
repeatedly justified its purpose not only in Moscow but also far 
outside it. Since 1988 the combined unit's servicemen have been 
involved in ensuring the state of emergency regime in various 
parts of the former Union and of the present Russia. Sumgait, 
Stepanakert, Kubatly, Fergana, Sukhumi -- this is a far from 
complete list of the "hot spots" where the soldiers of law and 
order have had to operate. Today the North Caucasus, where 
territorial disputes between Ossetians and Ingush are 
persisting, has become the division's second stationing 
location. State awards have been conferred upon almost every 
second serviceman for courage displayed in the fulfillment of 
peacemaking tasks. Seven people have been awarded the title 
Hero of the Russian Federation. 
  The president was pleased with the professional training of 
ODON servicemen. But he pointed out that the question of 
enhancing the mobility of special subunits remains acute today. 
The crime growth rate has prompted the country's leadership to 
resolve the question of increasing the strength of internal 
troop operational units by 52,000 men. 
  Army General Viktor Yerin awarded the ODON the pennant of 
the 
Russian Federation minister of internal affairs. "An excellent 
division!" -- this was how Boris Yeltsin voiced his attitude 
toward the combined unit.

  [Text] The press office of Gosatomnadzor [the State 
Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety] 
reports that Amendment 185, which envisages the allocation of 
560 billion rubles for ensuring nuclear and radiation safety at 
atomic power stations, is missing from the final version of the 
federal budget for reasons that have not been established. 
Moreover, the Ministry of Atomic Energy pledged to return this 
money as soon as it was paid by consumers for electricity 
produced by atomic power stations. The amendment was backed by 
the State Duma's power-engineering and ecology committees and 
was included in the draft budget passed at a second reading. 
However, the amendment is not in the final version of the 
budget that is due to be approved on 22 June. Atomic energy 
industry workers are sounding the alarm, claiming that to shut 
down all atomic power stations would require significantly more 
funds to ensure minimum safety standards.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F>
by Olga Yegorova in Minsk; date not given: "New Trio in Store 
for Forest?"] 
  [Text] The first presidential election in the history of 
the Belorussian [Belarusian] state should take place there 23 
June. Six candidates have been registered for this post 
including the republic's Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich. Here 
is our correspondent's conversation with him. 
  [Yegorova] Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, when the people come to 
the polling places 23 June and vote for a president, they should 
make a serious choice: Which path should sovereign Belorussia 
[Belarus] take -- should it accompany Russia or go it alone, 
that is orient itself toward the West.... 
  [Kebich] The union with Russia is my life, my policy. 
Chernomyrdin and I succeeded in agreeing on Belorussia's joining 
a single ruble zone with Russia and on close economic 
cooperation between our countries. The treaty was met with 
applause in the Russian State Duma. Indeed, it would be strange 
if Slavs were unable to come to an agreement among themselves. 
  There is no problem with the Russian-speaking population in 
Belorussia. What is more, it would not enter anybody's head in 
Russia to oppress the Belorussians. Almost 70 percent of our 
people came out in favor of a military and political and 
economic union with Russia in a public opinion poll. 
  But the way out of the crisis definitely lies first and 
foremost in the economic integration of our two countries. We 
cannot rely on Baltic-Black Sea utopias and assistance from the 
West. This is why our economic and intellectual potential is 
oriented on Russia. Can the Belorussian economy survive even for 
a single day without oil and gas? No. Through our treaty with 
Russia, we save 30 ECU's on each ton of petroleum and thousands 
of cubic meters of gas cost us much less than at world prices.... 
  Having seen these future prospects, business circles have 
supported me. Incidentally, one of the structures which 
proposed me as a presidential candidate was a 
scientific-industrial association. 
  [Yegorova] But, on the other hand, it was actually the 
directors of major Belorussian enterprises who just recently 
came out strongly against your policy.... 
  [Kebich] That's right. But the shock has passed. The 
leaders, together with the government, have started to search 
for a way out of the situation. Many enterprises have been 
restructuring themselves as they go along. It is precisely here 
that Belorussia's professional potential has showed through. 
Labor collectives, which were successfully preserved by hook or 
by crook, even when the enterprises were at a standstill, have 
gotten a second wind. 
  On the subject of our treaty with Russia, as yet only its 
first 10 points are "working." But results have already been 
achieved. In particular the abolition of customs duties gave us 
the opportunity to lower by 15-20 percent the prices of the 
CIS's best refrigerators and televisions which are from 
Belorussia. We immediately entered the market. 
  [Yegorova] You quite often hear that the bilateral treaty 
with Russia profits Belorussia alone. 
  [Kebich] This is, of course, untrue. For our part, we do 
not take any payment, even in "hares" [Belarusian monetary 
coupons], from the Russians for the lease of land, the transit 
of oil, gas, and cargoes, and the upkeep of military units.... 
  [Yegorova] What is to be done about the second part of the 
treaty with Russia, concerning the union of the monetary systems 
themselves, which, as we know, goes against the Republic's 
Constitution? 
  [Kebich] The Supreme Soviet should decide whether or not 
there is to be a ruble zone. The government has carried out its 
work. Well, if the deputies fail to support this idea, the 
people can be asked. For example, a referendum can be held. 
  [Yegorova] Do you believe in a referendum? 
  [Kebich] I believe in the people. I rely on our people's 
character, their industriousness, patience, and kindness. Also, 
I will not, of course, permit the rural areas, the kolkhozes to 
become ruined. If I become president, I will support those who 
feed us. You tell me what private farmer will think about the 
elderly peasant woman who has damaged her hands working on the 
farm, in the fields, and has now grown old. I myself am from a 
rural area, my mother is now approaching 90 years of age, and 
she simply cannot leave her land and cottage. 
  [Yegorova] Can we expect another historical meeting -- 
between Kebich, Chernomyrdin, and Kuchma? 
  [Kebich] Yes, and it will happen very soon. 
  [Yegorova] But when? 
  [Kebich] After the presidential elections....

  [Text] Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Prime 
Minister Vyacheslaw Kebich held negotiations in Vienna today. 
Local political observers deemed the recently established 
contacts between the two countries' leaders as fruitful. 
Austria supports the balanced political line of Belarus and its 
moving toward achieving accord within the CIS, as well as 
strengthening ties with both Russia and European states. During 
the negotiations, emphasis was placed on ways of seeking new 
forms of mutual cooperation; interest was also expressed in 
expanding contacts in the areas of politics, economics, and 
culture, according to an ITAR-TASS correspondent.

  [Text] As has already been reported, Belarusian Prime 
Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich is on a short working visit to 
Austria. The intention of the visit is to sign a document 
securing a $100 million credit to our Republic from the Austrian 
Government. Those credits will be used to purchase Russian oil 
to meet Belarusian needs and fund its subsequent processing at 
the Novopolotsk Oil Refinery. It is planned that a [word 
indistinct] portion of the gasoline and other oil products will 
be sold on European markets, which will provide hard currency to 
repay the credit. Vyachaslaw Kebich held a prolonged meeting 
with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. Also discussed at the 
negotiations was the issue of Belarus joining the GATT. 
Agreement was reached on all issues.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Larisa Lazar for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 21 Jun -- Either we choose the road of normal 
economic reforms, or we will remain a third-rate country, 
Stanislav Shushkevich, one of the candidates for the presidency 
of the Republic of Belarus and former head of parliament, said 
at a meeting with war and labor veterans. 
  The candidate expounded on his economic program, which 
envisages bringing the rate of inflation down to 6-10 percent by 
the end of the year (whereas now it stands at over 50 percent). 
  Those attending the meeting were also interested in problems 
connected with the breakup of the Soviet Union. Many people, 
particularly the older generation, are criticizing the former 
speaker, claiming that the USSR was destroyed at Belovezhskaya 
Pushcha. 
  Answering his critics, Stanislav Stanislavavich noted that 
the Soviet Union had in effect broken up before the meeting of 
the leaders of the Slav states at Viskuli. He reminded them 
that seven republics -- Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, 
Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova -- had not taken any part in 
the referendum on the future of the USSR, thereby expressing 
their negative attitude to the empire. Kazakhstan conducted its 
referendum with a different wording. Over 90 percent of 
residents in Ukraine voted for sovereignty. 
  In the opinion of Shushkevich, it was for this very reason 
that an attempt was made at Viskuli to preserve economic ties 
between the Republics and to give them a new impetus through the 
creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
presidential candidate believes that this averted a "Yugoslav 
scenario," which could well have taken much more dangerous forms.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian presidential candidate Stanislav </F>
Shuskevich by Arkadiy Khantsevich; place and date not given: 
"Stanislav Shushkevich: "We Will Take Russia's Wealth of 
Experience Into Account"] 
  [Text] Minsk/Moscow -- The presidential elections in 
Belorussia [Belarus] are on 23 June. Stanislav Shushkevich 
intends to compete seriously with the other contenders. Have 
his views of the course of the reforms in the Republic changed? 
  [Khantsevich] Stanislav Stanislavovich, it is no secret that 
one of the chief factors in the fight for the presidency will be 
the candidates' attitude toward the recently announced 
unification of the Russian and Belorussian [Belarusian] monetary 
systems. A strange situation has arisen: Many Russians 
disapproved of the idea, which is understandable -- they are 
frightened of a fall in their own living standards. But it 
turns out that in Belorussia as well many people are convinced 
that no good will come of the future union. Even National Bank 
Chairman Bogdankevich recently stated publicly that he is 
against this union. But Minsk officialdom, in the shape of 
Prime Minister Kebich, is unequivocally in favor. I believe you 
have a different view? 
  [Shushkevich] Do you know, I pondered it long and hard: 
Will ordinary people think that a negative attitude toward the 
unification of monetary systems is a negative attitude toward 
Russia itself? Will they not regard the two concepts as 
synonymous? But it turned out that our people are unusually 
sharp and intelligent. The National Bank chairman is a 
professional and he says perfectly sensible things. What is 
better: To combine our Belorussian bad management with Russian 
bad management, albeit less bad? Or to find ways of regulating 
the economy and think about fitting, European-type union? 
  In my view, we have to seek ways of collaborating as closely 
as possible -- in the customs, payments, and economic spheres. 
But without political intrigues; unification is friendship, 
they say, and all who are against friendship are anti-Russian. 
  [Khantsevich] So you think unification may not happen? 
  [Shushkevich] In principle it cannot happen. After all, 
there is no normal legal treaty. There is a protocol of intent, 
moreover, the intent of people who are not too hot on economics 
and have a poor idea of what a financial and credit system is 
but can well remember the USSR State Planning Committee and how 
you had to implement its directives. 
  [Khantsevich] Let us look at this problem from another 
angle. Does the approach you are advocating not contain the 
danger of further self-isolation, as has already happened in 
some former Soviet republics? For instance, in many Belorussian 
publications I have encountered the following notion: The 
national idea must be a priority for the future president. Do 
you agree with this statement? 
  [Shushkevich] I believe it is a normal statement to make. 
But first there is something I would like to emphasize. A 
person who loves Russia is called a patriot. A person who loves 
Belorussia is now called a nationalist. It is unfortunate, but 
it is a fact. 
  So I would like our sovereignty to be asserted not against 
Russia, but for the benefit of Belorussia. And if it is for the 
benefit of Belorussia, it must be in conjunction with Russia, in 
judicious collaboration with it. 
  [Khantsevich] Here is another fact from the newspapers. 
Some 77 percent of correspondents regret the collapse of the 
USSR and believe that the collapse is the main cause of the 
Belorussian people's current ills. What do you think? 
  [Shushkevich] First of all, who caused the Union to 
collapse? It is a totally naive view, one people use for their 
own political ends, that it was destroyed by three people -- 
Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and me. It is simply absurd, if you don't 
mind my saying so. The Union had collapsed and one had to have 
the courage to say so. We did have the courage. Strictly 
speaking, it was not three of us, but six, because the prime 
ministers also signed the agreement, including our Kebich. 
  It is propaganda, Goebbels-style, I would say, to try to 
persuade ordinary people that the Belovezhskaya Forest agreement 
is to blame for all our ills. It is based on a very simple 
slogan: They have destroyed the Union, so life has deteriorated. 
But the authors of this slogan are reluctant to admit that they 
have done nothing for three years and will not admit that they 
do not know how to reform the economy. 
  [Khantsevich] But, Stanislav Stanislavovich, your opponents 
in the current election campaign are resorting to more or less 
these arguments. Why vote for Shushkevich, they say, he was in 
power for three years, but managed to accomplish nothing.... 
  [Shushkevich] The answer is very simple. There is 
legislative power and executive power. I was head only of the 
Legislative Branch. If you recall, in former years leading 
writers were elected chairman of our Supreme Soviet -- 
Shamyakin, Tank, Naumenko.... Now I did not have any extra 
powers compared with what they had, except the right to sign 
international agreements. 
  So I repeat: I was not head of state. We would make laws 
whereby the executive branch was supposed to operate. And I can 
seriously say that a normal life and normal running of the 
economy can be created in accordance with the laws that were 
adopted in very difficult conditions, in a number of cases in 
confrontation with the Executive Branch. But it is also a fact 
that the government never had and still does not have the desire 
to do so. 
  [Khantsevich] Do you think that Belorussia is now going over 
the same ground as Russia, but much later? 
  [Shushkevich] No, I do not. Belorussia relishes Russia's 
failures and problems. It relishes the problems with 
privatization, with land and tax legislation. I am talking 
about those who officially represent Belorussia. 
  We do not have the same path as Russia, we have lost that 
option. 
  It is easy to be strong in hindsight. We must be grateful to 
Russia for its self-sacrifice. And we must study and digest its 
wealth of experience. 
  [Khantsevich] What do you think the Belorussian Government's 
reluctance to get down to serious reforms is due to? A lack of 
professionalism, an inability to analyze the situation, or 
something else? 
  [Shushkevich] No, it is supremely professional in the sphere 
of the distributive, state-planned economy. I would suggest the 
following analogy, since I am a physicist by education. The 
ideas of quantum physics were totally unacceptable to many 
people once, they were regarded as absurd. But they established 
themselves and now they in no way contradict the classical 
approaches that came from Newton. We have more or less the same 
story here -- the same protests from philistines who do not see 
how things can be different, different from the way they think. 
They have an algorithmic education, which is fine, perhaps, if 
you are involved in a trade, but very bad in the sphere of art. 
So in the matter of running a state, and this is an art, they 
are incompetents. They take on board today's slogans, but what 
they are essentially saying is: Let us be marketeers, but, for 
God's sake don't touch prices and subsidies policy, the policy 
of supporting bankrupts. What they say in the political sphere 
is: We will be sovereign, but we will abolish our national bank 
and become a piece of the Russian Federation budget. 
  That is why I believe that if a progovernment man becomes 
president at the elections, Belorussia's progress will be halted 
for many years. 
  [Khantsevich] Let us return to your resignation, while 
appreciating that it is not very pleasant for you. Was it 
inevitable or did it happen suddenly? 
  [Shushkevich] No, there was a logic to it. By a chance 
combination of events I managed to avoid resignation last June. 
Subsequently, the prevailing view among the deputies probably 
was that I would reform and honestly and carefully listen to 
advice. My November report convinced them that I had no 
intention of reforming.... 
  [Khantsevich] There is a view that you were too obstinate 
on the matter of collective security.... 
  [Shushkevich] I still believe we made the wrong decision. 
Collective security is no use to us. Belorussia has no 
interests in the Caucasus or in Tajikistan. Russia may have -- 
it is a great power and many Russians are living in those 
republics. But neutrality is more logical for us. 
  [Khantsevich] So how do you see the future of the 
Belorussian Army? 
  [Shushkevich] Very simple. It must be slimmed down again to 
one-half its present size. Leaving 40,000-50,000 men, no more, 
in view of the fact that we still have a very large number of 
armed Ministry of Internal Affairs internal troops. We must 
rely on the protection of Russia and the other great powers. 
  [Khantsevich] Fine, but how does the idea of sovereignty fit 
in with Russian protection? 
  [Shushkevich] Tell me, how did the idea of Finnish 
sovereignty tally with the fact that the USSR and the United 
States had given guarantees of Finnish neutrality? It was 
effectively protection by the two great powers. Here we have 
the same scenario. Let Russia acknowledge our neutrality -- 
that is all we want. And if Russia acknowledges it the United 
States will too. It would be splendid to have a neutral zone 
like that in the center of Europe. 
  [Khantsevich] It is fine in Finland. But how do you do it 
in Belorussia, where there is a missile silo under every fifth 
fir tree? 
  [Shushkevich] There are no silos in Belorussia, that is a 
mistake everyone makes. The only thing dug deep underground is 
the command and control system, the missiles themselves are 
mobile, so that the enemy does not know where they are deployed. 
So the presence of nuclear missiles reduces, rather than 
increases our security. It is merely tempting someone to put 
them out of action and hit Belorussia with a powerful nuclear 
strike. Basically, we are merely hostages at the moment. 
  [Khantsevich] One final question, Stanislav Stanislavovich. 
There is much talk in the Republic about corruption, including 
in the upper echelons of power. Various commissions have been 
set up, including a parliamentary one, but, as far as I know, 
there have been no big trials yet. Do you have your own program 
to fight this evil? 
  [Shushkevich] Do you know what I would do? Many people here 
have gotten rich under the law. The legislation was adopted 
either deliberately or unwittingly, but many people have 
obtained preferential credits for construction, which is 
tantamount to subsidies, and many banks have started functioning 
on the basis of the state capital holding and appropriating 
money and so on. Now, I would stop the witch hunt today and 
declare an amnesty for capital. We must rise above it, just as 
Russia rose above the idea of the "White House" shootout. 
  But that is now. Tomorrow let us establish very tough laws. 
Let us say: Here are the declarations of income, of property; 
now fill them in. 
  Of course, there will be many protests, but unless we focus 
attention on the defects in our legislation, on who is living 
off whom, we will lose a great deal in the future. That is what 
I would do.

  [Text] In accordance with the Constitution, the elections 
of the first Belarusian president will take place tomorrow. In 
this connection, the Cabinet of Ministers has issued a statement. 
  The popularly elected president should become a guarantor of 
the sovereignty, national security, and territorial integrity of 
our state, as well as ensure political and economic stability, 
peace, and accord within society, and implement urgent tasks 
related to foreign policy and foreign trade. In the process of 
preparations for the elections, especially during its final 
stages, some candidates for the highest state position have made 
the government the prime target of their criticism, mounting the 
most incredible charges against it. It is being drilled into 
the people that the government has no course of action to 
resolve many complex economic problems. Subject to attacks, the 
statement reads, are even attempts by the Cabinet of Ministers 
to support state-run industrial and agricultural enterprises, as 
well as measures intended to reduce price increases, 
unemployment, and social deregulation of the market. The 
government, the statement stresses, considers it a task of 
national importance to restore the Republic's economic potential 
and ensure its integration into the international system of 
economic and political relations. Its integration policies have 
been accepted by the international community. Their most 
important element is economic union with Russia. The concluded 
agreements have already produced concrete results. As never 
before, the Republic needs mutual support, understanding, and a 
uniting of the efforts of all people to overcome the difficult 
situation.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] A total of six candidates were included in the 
ballot papers -- Chairman of the Union of Agrarians and Council 
of Collective Farms Alexander Dubko; Premier Vyacheslav Kebich; 
head of the former parliamentary commission on struggle with 
corruption Alexander Lukashenko; Secretary of the Communist 
Party Central Committee Vasili Novikov; leader of the People's 
Front Zenon Poznyak and ex-speaker Stanislav Shushkevich. 
  Dubko, Kebich, Novikov and Lukashenko represent the left 
centrist bloc. Their programs focused on further integration 
with Russia, gradual non-shock implementation of the reforms, 
the continuing state management of the basic economic 
industries, simultaneous existence of different forms of 
property and the basic social guarantees for the population. 
These four candidates are backed by the bloc of parties and 
public movements making a part of the Belarussian People's 
Movement. The Belarusian People's Movement includes the 
Communist Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Republican 
Organization of Veterans, the Union of Officers, the Slav 
Council Party and others which have a wide net of local 
structures. 
  Shushkevich and Poznyak represent the bloc of the right 
forces. Their programs concentrated on "unconditional 
neutrality," active economic reforms and introduction of 
Belarus' own national currency units. 
  All candidates except Poznyak see Russia as the main 
economic 
partner of Belarus. Representatives of the left bloc regard 
establishment of an economic union with Russia as the beginning 
of a closer, not only economic but, later, also political 
integration. 
  Both the left and the right candidates tried to put forward 
single candidates from their blocs. However, no agreement has 
been reached. 
  IF Note: In accordance with the Belarusian legislation, the 
president is elected if more than a half of those voting during 
the elections vote for him. In Belarus 7.349713 million people 
enjoy the suffrage. About 2,000 Belarusian citizens will be 
voting abroad. 
  Observers in Minsk said they believed that there would be 
two 
rounds of the elections since there was quite a number of 
respected candidates each of who could win a significant part of 
votes. Moreover, according to the rating of the six candidates 
established during sociological polls, none of them had the 
guaranteed support of the majority of voters. This made the 
council of monitors under the Central Election Commission 
recommend that media publish no results of different 
sociological polls. 
  According to the Institute of Sociology under the Belarusian 
academy of Sciences, Kebich (with 31 pct of respondents 
supporting him) and Lukashenko (25 pct) have the best chances. 
They are followed by Shushkevich, Poznyak, Novikov and Dubko. 
  The Belarusian Interior Ministry told Interfax that the 
investigating bodies had practically completed the investigation 
into the false assassination attempt on Lukashenko and would 
soon announce the name of a person close to Lukashenko, who had 
shot the Mercedes of the candidates in the Belarussian 
presidency. 
  IF Note: In the evening on June 16 Interfax learned from the 
initiative group of Lukashenko's supporters that his car had 
been shot by unidentified persons during his campaigning trip 
across the Vitebsk Region. The press services of the Interior 
Ministry and the KGB officially announced that the assassination 
attempt had been planned and carried out by Lukashenko's group 
itself. 
  In an interview with Interfax leader of the initiative group 
Dmitriy Bulakhov disagreed with the conclusion made by the law 
enforcement bodies. He said that except this version the 
investigating bodies had not cared to work on any other 
versions. Bulakhov added that the investigation had been carried 
out without respecting the secret of preliminary investigation 
which made think that there were attempts to use the incident 
with Lukashenko against him pursuing some political goals. 
  Bulakhov did not rule out that at the last moment the 
candidacy of Lukashenko could be withdrawn from the presidential 
race since feeling that Lukashenko's rating was growing, the 
team of Kebich was ready to do anything in order to save its 
posts.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Zhdanko: "Election Scandals Over </F>
Shooting on Roads and in the Press"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yet another resounding 
scandal in recent days stems from the appearance in three major 
republic papers financed from the state budget of a wide-ranging 
article allegedly reprinted from the Dutch AMSTERDAMGUFIRE [as 
transliterated]. The article takes a negative view of all the 
presidential candidates except Vyacheslaw Kebich. Especially 
many harsh words and offensive hints are leveled at ex-Speaker 
Stanislaw Shushkevich. Mr. Shushkevich's initiative group sent 
an official question to the Dutch Embassy in Warsaw. It 
received the answer: No publication by this name exists in 
Holland, and there have been no such articles in the Dutch 
press. The identity of the author of the forged article remains 
a riddle. 
  The Oversight Council consisting of independent experts 
recommended that in the days remaining before the elections the 
mass media refrain from publishing sociological surveys because, 
the council thought, sociological services in the country are as 
a rule controlled by the government and some of its leaders are 
members of Mr. Kebich's initiative group. This decision evoked 
a negative reaction from official sociologists. According to 
their polls, Mr. Kebich has enjoyed unequaled popularity in the 
republic for a long time now, although observers believe that 
the real mood among the bulk of the population creates some 
doubt that the prime minister will win the 23 June elections.

  [Text] Over the past two years, about 15,000 officers have 
been discharged from the Belarusian Armed Forces. These were 
basically individuals entitled to pensions or those who did not 
wish to continue their service. At the same, the number of 
officers who were born in Belarus has noticeably increased. 
While such officers used to represent 16 percent of all 
personnel in the Belarusian Armed Fores, this ratio has risen to 
47 percent today. It is estimated that with new graduates from 
the military schools joining the Armed Forces, this number will 
climb to 53-55 percent. In as little as one year, Belarus-born 
servicemen will account for 65 percent of the Belarusian Army, 
RID agency reported.

  [Text] We, the Heads of Government of the Baltic States, in 
the interests of deepening and widening mutual understanding, 
cooperation and friendly relations between Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania, and being desirous to strengthen regional cooperation 
in the context of European integration processes, met in Tallinn 
on June 13, 1994, and established a Baltic Council of Ministers. 
  At the founding session of the Baltic Council of Ministers 
we 
adopted Terms of Reference for the Council. The Minister 
President of the Republic of Latvia was elected chairman of the 
Baltic Council of Ministers for the first year, until 1 July 
1995. 
  We also signed an Agreement on Baltic Parliamentary and 
Governmental Cooperation between the Republic of Estonia, the 
Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. We view the 
signing of this Agreement as an historic step towards the 
integration of the Baltic States into the European Union. 
  We consider that there is still much to be done to 
strengthen 
practical cooperation. Among the first priorities is to ensure 
the provision of social security for citizens of one Baltic 
State living on the territory of another, the standardization of 
customs systems and the facilitation of border-crossings between 
our countries. Signed by Valdis Birkavs, Minister President of 
the Republic of Latvia; Adolfas Slezevicius, Prime Minister of

  [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun 1994 -- 1. Russia and NATO have a 
significant contribution to make to guaranteeing European 
stability and security. Constructive relations of cooperation 
between Russia and NATO, based on mutual respect, advantage, and 
friendship, are therefore a key element in security and 
stability in Europe and accord with the interests of all other

  Russia and NATO welcome the progress that has already been 
achieved in their relations, including that within the framework 
of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and they will strive 
to strengthen it further. 
  2. Russia's signing of Partnership for Peace opens up big 
new 
opportunities for the development of relations by means of 
practical cooperation in spheres covered by the framework 
document of Partnership for Peace. 
  Russia and NATO have agreed to prepare a wide-ranging, 
individual program of partnership, in keeping with Russia's 
size, importance and potential. 
  3. They have agreed to establish far-reaching Russia-NATO 
cooperation relations both within and outside the framework of 
Partnership for Peace. These relations, aimed at strengthening 
mutual confidence and openness, will develop to reflect common 
goals and supplement and strengthen relations with all other 
states. They are not directed against the interests of third 
countries and will be transparent. 
  4. Russia and NATO have agreed on broad and in-depth 
dialogue and cooperation in those areas where Russia can make a 
unique and important contribution commensurate with its weight 
and responsibility as a major European, world and nuclear power: 
  -- by exchanging information on security policy problems of 
European dimension; 
  -- by holding, as required, political consultations on 
issues 
of mutual interest; 
  -- by cooperating on the entire range of security issues, 
including, as required, in the sphere of peace-keeping.

  [Text] The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has 
declared that the protocol to the Russia-NATO program due to be 
approved in Brussels is not going to be signed. 
  Answering a question from Interfax before his departure for 
Brussels on Tuesday he said the protocol does not require 
signing. "It registers the understanding that Russia and NATO 
are going to cooperate on key elements of the program the 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev submitted to the NATO 
headquarters about a month ago", Kozyrev said. 
  According to him, Grachev described the military aspects of 
cooperation. "Now we are going to add a political element and 
officially proclaim the cooperation of Russia and NATO," Kozyrev 
said adding that he would sign the Partnership for Peace program 
in Brussels. "We welcome this program too", he said. 
  The minister stressed that the protocol and program 
supplement, not contradict each other. 
  According to Kozyrev, the protocol which is now getting its 
final touch reflects the special relationship of Russia and NATO 
and their potentials. "The interaction and mutually- beneficial 
cooperation of Russia and NATO are possible and necessary", the 
minister reiterated.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not passed his 
final decision regarding the joint Russian-American exercises 
scheduled for this summer on the Totsk test range in the 
Orenburg Region. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev reported 
about this to our Interfax correspondents Wednesday. Grachev 
made the statement after the ceremony of placing wreaths at the 
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin Wall by the 
leadership of the Russian Defense Ministry, due to the 53rd 
anniversary since the beginning of the Great Patriotic War - 
WWII. 
  "If we reject the joint Russian-American exercises on the 
Totsk test range, we shall loose from the political point of 
view," declared Grachev. 
  Despite a negative attitude towards these exercises on the 
part of the State Duma, Grachev is convinced that "the exercises 
should be conducted on the Totsk test range." He reported that 
he had sent a letter to State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin 
explaining his position. "These are not combined arms exercises 
but peace-keeping ones," Grachev emphasized. 
  He pointed out that the total number of Russian armed forces 
participating in peace-making operations, including 3000 
peacekeepers in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, is 
not more than 20,000 people. 
  Grachev noted that understaffed detachments of land forces 
pose major problems to the Russian army. He explained the lack 
of soldiers by a weak legal base for the call up and 
inappropriate financing. The main thing what the army needs 
from the state is "to give money and to give people," Grachev 
said. 
  "Currently we have not enough funds or forces in order to 
create the army about which we dream, however, the might of our 
army is growing with every passing day and I think that it will 
revive in a year of two," Grachev said.

  [Text] President Kravchuk has ruled that the Crimean 
President's decrees "On the property of the Republic of Crimea" 
and "On the privatization of Crimea's state-run enterprises" 
contravene Ukraine's legislation. 
  He dismissed as illegal the declaration of Crimea's control 
over the property of state-run transportation depots, 
information and communication facilities, higher educational 
establishments and other institutions in Crimea. 
  The decree maintains that in line with Ukrainian law, this 
is 
part of the property that belongs to all in society. 
  Besides, part of what is to be privatized in accordance with 
the Crimean President Meshkov's decree relates to the national 
property of Ukraine, the decree stresses.

  [Text] Sevastopol, 21 Jun -- Serhiy Tsekov, Supreme Council 
of Crimea chairman, has visited Sevastopol. He met there Black 
Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin, Sevastopol City Council 
Chairman Viktor Semenov, and some Republican Movement of Crimea 
activists who are running in the election to the city council of 
the next convocation. 
  Meeting representatives of the mass media, Serhiy Tsekov 
stated that "the Supreme Council of Crimea has no problems with 
the government." At the same time he spoke against the 
president of Crimea being granted directive powers and against 
Ilma Umerov, a Crimean Tartar deputy, being appointed to the 
post of Crimea's social policy minister. 
  Serhiy Tsekov added that the city of Sevastopol should be 
fully integrated in Crimea and that "if Crimea's authorities 
fail to achieve this in a civilized manner, a decision will -- 
in the worst case -- be taken declaring Sevastopol the capital 
of Crimea." Oleksiy Melnikov, Supreme Council of Crimea deputy 
chairman, backed that opinion, saying: "If Russia does not need 
Sevastopol, Crimea does."

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] At the final session of an international economic 
conference in Switzerland last Sunday, President Mircea Snegur 
dedicated a considerable part of his report to the peaceful, 
civilized settlement of regional conflicts. He said in any 
circumstances Moldova will remain true to civilized compromise 
aimed at the formation of an open system of local, regional, 
global, and collective security. 
  In Snegur's opinion the example of resolving the conflict in 
East Moldova (the Dniestr [Dniester] River valley) is convincing 
proof that in such situations only talks and compromise can 
guarantee success. However, the president is convinced that the 
effectiveness of the policy of compromise largely depends on the 
stage of a conflict. 
  He said the aggravation of the situation in southern regions 
with a predominantly Gagauzi population as well as in the east 
was caused by extremely politicized declarations in which 
political leaders were not always sincere or consistent. 
  According to Snegur, the Moldovan leadership did much to 
resolve the problems of those regions by peaceful means. A 
solution acceptable for both sides was found for Gagauzi 
regions, he said. Snegur told the conference that the region 
would be given a special legal status based on a high degree of 
self-determination and the sharing of powers with the central 
government. He announced that the approach was supported by the 
Council of Europe, the CSCE and conformed with plans of 
switching to a new system of territorial division of Moldova. 
  IF Note: The draft law agreed upon with the Moldovan 
leadership was signed on 27 May by the president and speaker of 
parliament of the Gagauzi Republic and submitted to the 
president and speaker of parliament of Moldova. On 9 June it 
was approved by the Gagauzi parliament and sent to the Moldovan 
parliament. 
  On Monday, the leadership of the self-proclaimed Gagauzi 
Republic accused the Moldovan government of distorting the draft 
law. The Gagauzi president and speaker of parliament Stepan 
Topal and Mikhail Kendigilian issued a statement saying that 
contrary to the agreement a Moldovan parliamentary committee 
altered the document. They called the move unilateral and 
unprecedented and claimed that it could not have been made 
without the knowledge and consent of President Mircea Snegur and 
speaker of parliament Petre Luchinski. 
  The statement calls for stopping the parliamentary debate on 
the distorted document and demands a meeting with the Moldovan 
leadership with the mediation of the CSCE mission. Gagauzi 
leaders placed the entire responsibility for the possible 
worsening of relations on the Moldovan leadership.

  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev received today 
Kyrgyzstan's Prime Minister Apas Dzhumagulov, who is on a 
working visit in Kazakhstan. Government delegations of 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, led by Prime Ministers Tereshchenko 
and Dzumagulov had a meeting later. They discussed implementing 
the agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the two 
countries. They also discussed the issue of paying our 
republic's debt of $55 million to the neighboring state for 
power supplies. The meeting discussed prospects for cooperation 
in the joint construction of the Kumbartinskiy GES and the 
possibility of power supplies to the southern parts of 
Kazakhstan, the volume of this year's supplies of Kazakhstan's 
chemical compounds with a trace of uranium to the Karabaltinskiy 
ore mining combine. The initiative for a joint 
Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan venture for processing and refining raw 
materials containing uranium was supported. It was decided that 
profits from selling uranium protoxide and oxide will be split 
in the following way: Kazakhstan's works will get 71 percent and 
Kyrgyzstan's 29 percent. 
  An intergovernmental protocol on the implementation of 
agreements on trade and economic cooperation between the two 
republics for 1994 and an agreement on supplying Kyrgyzstan with 
raw materials containing uranium starting from this year up to 
the year 2,000 were signed. Tereshchenko and Dzhumagulov told 
journalists that the working visit has given a new impetus to 
trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

  [Text] Dushanbe, 21 Jun -- The press center of Tajikistan's 
Defense Ministry reports that in the course of troop operations 
between 7 and 17 June in Garmskiy, Tajikabadskiy, and 
Jirgitalskiy Rayons, a stronghold of Tajik opposition fighters, 
who were receiving military assistance from Afghan mojaheddin 
instructors, was crushed in the territory of the destroyed 
villages of Chevi Mangaryk. The operations were conducted 
jointly by units of the Defense, Interior, and Security 
Ministries of Tajikistan. 
  In the course of just one battle, 12 opposition fighters 
were 
killed and seven wounded, other casualty figures are being 
clarified. German and British-made radio communication 
equipment, as well as a grenade launcher, grenades, and firearm 
ammunition were seized. Fire drill notebooks in Tajik and Pashto 
and other documents belonging to the fighters were found. 
  Law-enforcement agencies detained several members of armed 
groups. Four servicemen of the Defense Ministry of Tajikistan 
were killed in the fighting and nine were wounded. Measures 
were taken during the operation to ensure the maximum safety of 
civilians from nearby villages. 
  The tasks set before the troops have been carried out. Units 
of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan have now returned to their 
sites of regular deployment. However, despite all the measures 
that are being taken by the authorities and the forces to 
stabilize the situation in the Garm group of rayons, the 
situation there remains tense.

  [Text] Moscow June 21 TASS -- An appeal of the Russian 
Federation Council requested the State Duma today to take into 
account its opinion when discussing the draft 1994 budget in

  [Text] Armenian Presidential Press Secretary Levon Zurabyan 
held a news conference today. Our correspondent Gevorg Gazaryan 
was present. 
  [Begin recording] [Gazaryan] Armenian Presidential Press 
Secretary Levon Zurabyan opened his news conference by saying: 
The republic's president has so often expressed his views on 
the Constitution that there is no need to discuss it again 
today. I will instead discuss Karabakh and the peace process. 
He reminded reporters of the different phases of the mediation 
efforts for peace by the CSCE and Russia, and of the fact that 
no guaranteed cease-fire has been established due to the 
position of the Azerbaijani authorities, something that could 
have opened the door to further steps. 
  Asked about Azerbaijan's position on the establishment of 
peace in the region, Mr. Zurabyan said: 
  [Zurabyan] Azerbaijan is reneging on its previous position, 
which it declared during the visit of Ambassador Mosberg, deputy 
chairman of CSCE Minsk Group, to the region between 26 April to 
2 May. At that time, Azerbaijan was ready for an unconditional 
cease-fire. This change, and the latest incidents in 
Noyemberyanskiy Rayon, about which you already know, and the 
[Armenian] Foreign Ministry's statement on 18 June in connection 
with these incidents testify to the hardening of Azerbaijan's 
position. This causes serious concern for Armenia. 
  [Gazaryan] The press secretary then assessed the mediation 
efforts of Jan Eliasson, chairman of CSCE Minsk Group. Let me 
remind you that Eliasson visited Baku and Yerevan twice and 
Stepanakert once. The ambassador met with the Armenian 
president. He also met the Armenian foreign minister yesterday. 
  [Zurabyan] Eliasson's mission produced no tangible progress 
in the peace process in practical terms. In contrast to his 
previous visit, this time joint examination of the first and 
second phases [of the peace process] and the deployment of the 
peace forces in the conflict zone were stressed. Eliasson also 
expressed concern that if there were a delay in agreement on the 
second phase, the CSCE observers who were to be deployed at the 
first phase could find themselves in a dangerous and uncertain 
situation. 
  [Gazaryan] Asked if the CSCE and Russian mediatory efforts 
have reached an impasse, the press secretary replied: 
  [Zurabyan] Regarding cooperation between CSCE and Russia on 
stationing observers and peace forces -- which would have 
prevented Azerbaijan from engaging in constant evasive maneuvers 
between the two mediatory missions -- there has not been any 
real progress on this issue yet. In effect, this issue lacks 
the necessary mutual consensus and cooperation, which otherwise 
would substantially contribute to the productivity of the 
peaceful settlement. [end recording]

  [Text] The Georgian parliament held a session today which 
discussed the country's budget. The parliamentary opposition 
gave a sharply negative assessment of the draft budget and took 
the opportunity to raise the issue of authority, demanding that 
the head of state be stripped of his special powers. 
  The session also heard a statement from the parliamentary 
majority, which condemns the activity of opposition deputies who 
are trying to create an obstructive atmosphere in the country's 
supreme legislative body and introduce it into the republic's 
sociopolitical life in general. The statement stresses that 
attempts by the opposition to impose on deputies a debate on the 
issue of authority, especially the issue of stripping the head 
of state of his special powers, is aimed at sowing 
destabilization in the country. The statement says that the 
issue of authority is addressed by the draft of the republic's 
new constitution and will be debated before the constitution is 
adopted.

  [Text] The anti-crime decree was drafted in 24 hours and 
was signed by President Yeltsin in the morning of June 15, 
shortly before his departure to the Far East, a well-informed 
Kremlin source told Interfax. He said that the idea of taking 
urgent additional measures to combat organized crime had been 
initiated by the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS), and 
that the Interior Ministry had insisted that it be documented in 
a decree, not in a law. 
  He also said that in the middle of June, FCS 
Director-General 
Sergey Stepashin sent a letter to President Yeltsin urging him 
to draft a law on amending and enlarging the Criminal Code and 
submitting it to the State Duma. Concurrently, the idea was 
proposed of passing a decree on measures to step up the campaign 
against organized crime. 
  The source maintains that the decree provided for measures 
which did not go beyond the president's constitutional powers. 
Other measures were to be implemented after the parliament 
adopted the draft law submitted by the president. 
  In actual fact, another version, proposed by Interior 
Minister Viktor Yerin and by his first deputy Mikhail Yegorov, 
was adopted. In a slightly softened form, this version was used 
as the foundation for the presidential decree. 
  The source said that the draft decree had been signed by the 
FCS's First Deputy Director-General Anatoliy Safonov, not by 
Stepashin who left for the Far East on June 13.

  [Text] Speaker of the upper house of Russian parliament, 
the Federation Council (FC), Vladimir Shumeyko says deputies are 
unhappy about parts of the federal constitution dealing with the 
upper house and parliament as a whole. 
  In a report on the FC's role and place in overcoming 
critical 
situations on Tuesday, Shumeyko also pointed to a lack of 
organization by the parliamentary committees, leadership and its 
staff. 
  He said the constitutionally-enshrined power of the Council 
for law making was its "most powerful weapon". To invigorate 
Council activity, Shumeyko proposed amending articles 104 and 
105 of the federal constitution to enable the Council to bring 
bills in the Federal Assembly both the through the lower house 
and independently. 
  This, he said, can help relieve the State Duma of the burden 
of law making and distribute bills evenly between the two houses 
to help on the legislative process. 
  Shumeyko pointed to what made the Council and Duma different 
from each other. Unlike the Duma which is the arena of power 
struggle and compromise between different political and party 
interests, he said, the upper house represents the interests of 
Russian autonomies and regions. 
  In his view, Russia is undergoing a cultural rather than 
economic or political crisis. Shumeyko said that as the supreme 
legislative body, the Federation Council was designed to exploit 
the idea of statehood and patriotism to strengthen rather than 
overhaul the existing establishment.

  [Text] A group of Russian Duma deputies led by Konstantin 
Zatulin, head of the Committee for CIS Affairs, unexpectedly 
arrived in Minsk at the end of last week. 
  According to official accounts, the aim of the Russians' 
visit was to discuss three issues with their Belarusian 
colleagues: Belarusian-Russian relations, the unification of 
monetary systems, and the Belarusian attitude toward amending 
the Constitution. According to Belarusian People's Deputy 
Uladzimir Novik, however, the visit was actually prompted by the 
upcoming presidential elections in Belarus. The deputy shared 
with an RID correspondent his impressions from the meetings with 
the Russian delegation: "I believe that Russian experts analyze 
the situation in Belarus and realize that the image of 
Vyachaslaw Kebich is very unattractive. Other candidates, 
including Paznyak, Lukashenka, and Shushkevich, have a much 
higher rating. That is why the Russian side is undertaking 
certain steps, given that it needs a "loyal" president. 
  People like Paznyak or Shushkevich intend to build a 
Belarusian state and not a northwestern province [of Russia]. 
Besides, neither of them is going to disrupt ties or contacts 
with Russia. The visitors, undoubtedly, had one goal --to 
support the pro-Russian candidate, who will then walk in the 
footsteps of Russia's politics and pursue servile policies. 
Zatulin did not try to conceal the fact that Russia has large 
military-political and strategic interests in Belarus. In 
particular, he pointed out that the Republic hosts important 
military bases in Vileyka and Baranovichi, and that it can have 
its bases in Russia, too. This was said in such a mocking 
manner that my impression is -- Russia does not want to see or 
perceive us as a state. I think that their delegation has 
demonstrated that there is no normal sober atmosphere in the 
Russian Duma and no prospects for equal cooperation. The spirit 
of a great empire prevails there, and plans are being made to 
revive this empire. 
  Zatulin told me that the union was disbanded for Russia to 
build a new empire. That is why I have the impression that the 
unification of monetary systems is just another invention of 
Russian wizards and strategists, aimed at eliminating Belarusian 
statehood. They are ready to ratify this absurd agreement if 
this can help their protege. A majority of Belarusian deputies 
present at the meeting, however, opposed the agreement and the 
introduction of amendments to the Constitution."

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Ambassador to Ukraine Vitaliy </F>
Vladimirovich Kurashyk by M. Shymanskiy; place and date not 
given: "I Am Ambassador; What Can I Do?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Shymanskiy] Well, Vitaliy Vladimirovich, what 
can you tell me about your work at the embassy? 
  [Kurashyk] Our embassy is staffed by only three diplomats, 
so 
we are swamped with work. In addition, everything is 
complicated and our bilateral relations are not so cloudless. 
My situation, however, is rather secure because I am personally 
acquainted with all the leaders of Ukraine. My previous work as 
Crimean prime minister has served me well. 
  Hence, if I need a high-level meeting I have no problems 
getting one. 
  [Shymanskiy] Are there many Belarusians residing in Ukraine? 
  [Kurashyk] Some 450,000. This is not a small number. 
Approximately 52,000 Belarusians live in the Crimea, where the 
situation is rather troubled. Our countrymen turn to our 
embassy with various problems such as, for example, issuing 
visas, helping with inheritance issues, and so on. Of course, 
we do not turn their requests down and try to conscientiously 
perform all consular duties. 
  [Shymanskiy] Ukraine is experiencing a rather tense social- 
political situation. How would you characterize it? 
  [Kurashyk] The legislative elections are over, the corps of 
deputies has been formed and has begun work. The Republic is 
looking forward to the presidential elections. However, this 
implies harsh political battles. Well, the same refers to 
Belarus, which is also electing a president. 
  Ukraine has its own specific features. It is more 
heterogeneous than Belarus. Its west differs from its south in 
political sentiments and administrative organization. In 
addition, it has the Crimea, which has its own president. All 
this, along with a deep economic crisis, intensifies the tension. 
  [Shymanskiy] Belarusian-Ukrainian relations have 
traditionally been strong, friendly, and diverse. We have 
always been proud of this. Neighbors, brothers.... What about 
current relations? 
  [Kurashyk] Currently, some politicians want to disintegrate 
our brotherly relations. Let us take the economy, for example. 
Our Belarusian economy is in many aspects closely connected 
with the Ukrainian economy. We became independent states (of 
course, this is a positive issue) but our economic contacts were 
severed and this inflicted a lot of difficulties and problems on 
us. 
  Of all CIS states, Belarus remained as virtually the only 
state with which Ukraine could cooperate on a partnership basis. 
What about our current foreign trade contacts? They do not 
meet our demands. I can provide only two figures for you. Last 
year, Belarus fulfilled only 41.7 percent of its deliveries to 
Ukraine; Ukraine -- 44 percent. 
  [Shymanskiy] Let us be sincere: Are you willing to admit 
that the two states simply do not want to cooperate with one 
another? 
  [Kurashyk] Why? We simply cannot exist without one another. 
We have signed some 20 intergovernmental agreements. This is a 
considerable number. How are they being implemented? To my 
regret, not properly. Our mutual deliveries do not meet the 
demands of both Belarus and Ukraine. 
  [Shymanskiy] So, what is the problem? 
  [Kurashyk] I will provide you with only some of the 
arguments. The mechanism of holding control over the 
implementation of these agreements has not been worked out 
properly. Both sides are responsible for this situation. In 
addition, frequent changes in the Ukrainian leadership also 
blocked the implementation of our pacts. During the past three 
years, there have been four prime ministers in Ukraine. When a 
prime minister quits, his entire team also quits. When I meet 
with a minister and remind him that this or that agreement is 
not being implemented, it often happens that he knows nothing at 
all about this issue. It is as if he does not have to implement 
the decisions adopted before him. However, the point of 
discussion is bilateral agreements, the implementation of which 
is not a prime minister's private business but an important part 
of state economic policy. 
  [Shymanskiy] Well, let us assume that frequent changes of 
leaders is a domestic matter of Ukraine. However, can both 
states implement what they have already agreed upon? 
  [Kurashyk] In my opinion, we should establish -- both in 
Ukraine and Belarus -- a sort of coordinating center to deal 
with our trade and economic relations. In fact, we currently 
lack an organization which is responsible for implementing these 
agreements. Each ministry is responsible for its own narrow 
interests. Even statistical data issued by the Ministry of 
Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Customs 
Committee are completely different. Can this continue on this 
way? Ukraine has already adopted a decision to establish its 
own trading house in Minsk. Belarus should follow this example. 
  Belarusian and Ukrainian enterprises can resolve many issues 
regarding their mutual deliveries. In fact, they will resolve 
these issues on the condition that they have efficient managers. 
This is good because you should not stand idly by and wait 
until politicians make a deal. 
  [Shymanskiy] This opinion is expressed not only by you, as 
Belarusian ambassador to Ukraine, but also by our Belarusian 
managers. This is the voice of one crying out in the 
wilderness. How long will this last? Can our embassy do 
anything? 
  [Kurashyk] We can cry as long as we wish, however, no one 
will resolve issues for us. We should join our forces and seek 
real ways of stabilizing our bilateral trade and economic 
relations. What does our embassy do in this regard? I am 
sincere: We could not handle these issues before because we 
lacked experts. However, our embassy has now hired Petr 
Pyasetskiy as our trade and economic adviser. He is an 
efficient and enterprising person, who well understands both the 
system of production and economics. So, appropriate work is now 
under way. 
  We chose a large group of Belarusian enterprises which are 
leaders in their sectors and have a high export potential. They 
have to calculate mutual deliveries in karbovanetses and 
Belarusian rubles. They have already drafted an agreement on 
this issue. We have high hopes that this agreement will soon be 
signed. 
<H5>  They Cut the Branch on Which They Sat </H5>
  [Shymanskiy] I know that the Belarusian 
Scientific-Industrial 
Association and the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs do a lot in this direction. How do you assess 
their efforts? 
  [Kurashyk] You properly defined their work as efforts. Of 
course, I approve of their work and try to support those who can 
do something in this regard. First of all, I am speaking about 
Belarusian and Ukrainian managers of enterprises. They do 
everything possible to draw our economies closer. 
  [Shymanskiy] This is a very difficult thing to do because 
even the leaders of our states cannot solve this issue properly. 
What can managers do? 
  [Kurashyk] Nevertheless, they have managed to do something. 
Recently, Belarusian and Ukrainian industrialists met in Kiev 
and discussed their business relations. I am referring to 
direct economic relations between Belarusian and Ukrainian 
enterprises. They decided to draft a program on mutual 
cooperation to establish joint projects and develop new types of 
competitive products... As far as I know, interesting proposals 
will be submitted to our governments. 
  [Shymanskiy] Are Belarusian and Ukrainian politicians 
keeping 
themselves for themselves? Who listens to them? 
  [Kurashyk] Excuse me, but it is no fault of theirs if no one 
listens to them. Let those people who -- due to their official 
positions -- have to listen and react to them. I am holding out 
hope that the Belarusian and Ukrainian Governments -- to which 
participants in this meeting addressed their proposals -- will 
behave in this way. 
<H5>  Does our Ambassador Have To Wait Long in Ukrainian </H5>
President's Admission Room? 
  [Shymanskiy] It seems to me that there are other arguments 
negatively affecting our bilateral relations. They are of a 
political nature. 
  [Kurashyk] The point is that neither the Belarusian nor the 
Ukrainian Government has the patience to tolerate some political 
developments. For example, I can hear some people in Ukraine 
criticizing Belarusian-Russian economic relations, in 
particular, their intention to unite in a single ruble zone. 
  [Shymanskiy] Why should Belarus coordinate its policy with 
Ukraine? It is a sovereign state... 
  [Kurashyk] You are right. Belarus can choose its own 
political and economic track in line with the wishes of its 
people, legislature, and government. Next. Not all people 
realize why Belarus decided to become a nonnuclear state. I have 
to explain this often, primarily to foreign diplomats accredited 
in Kiev. I am not boasting but they often meet me and talk 
about Belarusian developments. As to the question of our 
nonnuclear status, I explain to them that one Chernobyl -- the 
consequences of which will have to be dealt with for several 
decades -- was quite enough for Belarus. In fact, we are alone 
in implementing the Chernobyl cleanup program. Who would even 
think about nuclear weapons in such a situation? 
  [Shymanskiy] Are you often received by President Kravchuk? 
How long do you usually have to wait to be received by the 
president? 
  [Kurashyk] Why should I often visit the president? We should 
not bother the president with various and sundry trifles. I 
come to him only on urgent occasions to discuss important state 
matters. In addition, there are no complications with being 
received in the presidential office. I have never waited longer 
than 10 minutes. In my opinion, the point is not in my 
personality but in the president's attitude toward our Republic 
and its people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, Jun 22, AP -- BNS - The European Union's 
[EU] executive commission said Wednesday it has signed a 
preliminary free trade accord with Latvia and plans to conclude 
a similar deal with Lithuania on June 27. A statement from the 
commission said negotiations with Estonia are also nearing 
completion. 
  The agreements with the three Baltic states are part of 
wider 
EU efforts to improve economic and political links with the 
former communist nations of eastern Europe. The EU has already 
wide- ranging trade accords with the Czech and Slovak Republics, 
Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. 
  Last week Ukraine became the first former Soviet nation to 
conclude such a deal with the EU, and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will sign one Friday at a meeting of EU leaders in 
Corfu, Greece. 
  The commission said it expects to finalize the agreement 
with 
Latvia by Jan. 1. on setting up a free trade zone for 
industrial goods within four years. During those years, Latvian 
products will freely enter the 12-nation trade bloc. Latvia may 
retain some export and import restrictions on some industrial 
products and farm goods. 
  The commission hopes to establish a free-trade zone with 
Estonia by the end of the year. That would overcome a 
difficulty created by Finland's plans to join the EU on Jan. 1, 
as Finland already has a free trade accord with Estonia. For 
Latvia and Lithuania, the accords foresee transition periods 
allowing them to reach the level of economic development already 
attained in Estonia.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 23 ITAR-TASS -- The Russian national 
press today leads with reports about the signing by Russian 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev in Brussels of the 
Partnership for Peace framework document and of the bilateral 
protocol "Russia and NATO". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says in its comment on the event that it 
took place, symbolically, on June 22, the anniversary of the 
beginning of the Great Patriotic War which resulted in the split 
of the world into two opposing camps. By becoming the West's 
partner in European and global security, Russia cleared yet 
another barrier on its way to the civilised world community". 
  "Moscow has secured a special relationship with the West," 
according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. In its analysis of the 
documents signed by the Russian minister of foreign affairs, the 
newspaper says: "It appears that the key phrase of the 
(Russia-NATO) protocol is "Russia and NATO agree to prepare an 
extensive individual programme of partnership which is in line 
with Russia's size, significance and potential". This means 
that Moscow has finally got what it wanted and NATO has 
recognised Russia's "special status". 
  TRUD stresses that "the move enables this country to take a 
more active part in European affairs, including defence. By 
joining the Partnership for Peace programme, Russia avoided the 
danger of finding itself in a sort of isolation from the further 
development of military and political cooperation on the 
European continent". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA writes: "The most important thing is that 
the 
realisation of the Partnership for Peace programme will bridge 
for Russia and NATO the gap which separated Europe a few years 
ago. Another bridge will be provided by the agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European 
Union, which President Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation 
is due to sign on the Greek island of Corfu, where a summit of 
the European Union member countries will take place on June 24. 
When the agreement takes effect, it will open up a new, much 
more extensive potential for cooperation between Russia and the 
European Union in the economic and political fields.

  [Text] On Wednesday the Russian State Duma failed to 
approve the 1994 federal budget at third reading even though it 
was put to a vote three times. 
  During the last round in the evening, 212 votes were cast 
for 
the budget, 43 against with 60 abstentions. Approval required 
225 votes. 
  Acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin did not succeed in 
persuading the Duma to pass the budget as a compromise reached 
in close cooperation between the government and the lower house 
of parliament. He said that without an approved budget the 
government does not have the right to use credits of the Central 
Bank but is limited to taxes which he said constitute only 60 
pct of the necessary resources. This threatens this year's 
supplies to North Russia and the gathering of the harvest and 
puts off the planned raise in the earnings of government 
employees. 
  After the voting results were announced the Agrarian faction 
suggested putting off the matter till Friday as 15 of its 
members were absent. 
  Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin gave instructions to cancel all 
deputy business trips and visits of parliamentary delegations 
and said that all deputies should come to Moscow for the crucial 
vote. 
  Appropriate orders were given to the head of the office of 
the Duma Andrey Voikov. 
  The voting is scheduled for Friday morning when a plenary 
session is to begin at 9 a.m.

<F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva report under the "Boycott" rubric: </F>
"Ivan Rybkin Shouts at Absentees. The Upper Chamber Does Not 
Want To, the Lower One Cannot Approve the Budget"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's plenary meeting Ivan Rybkin, speaker 
of the lower chamber, raised his voice to a shout and ordered 
that deputies on trips be recalled, the scheduled State Duma 
visit to The Hague be canceled, and all deputies except for the 
sick come to work by 0900 hours on Friday. The speaker's fury 
stemmed from parliament's failure to adopt the 1995 [as 
published] federal budget at the third reading. Deputies voted 
three times, and in the second vote the budget had every chance 
of being approved -- it fell short by only four votes, which 
could admittedly have been supplied by the 
deputies-cum-government members currently out of town. 
  Nothing seemed to foreshadow such an outcome. After a fairly 
sluggish discussion of the agenda (the deputies did not even 
react to an enticing proposal to dismiss Andrey Kozyrev, who 
signed the treaty on partnership with NATO yesterday), the State 
Duma proceeded to approve the budget it had already given its 
second reading. Things were taking their normal course, but 
somehow lethargically as if in a slow-motion picture: Budget 
Committee Chairman Zadornov had the floor, Deputy Finance 
Minister Petrov followed him, a vote was held -- and there you 
go, the budget was rejected by a margin of 31 votes. The 
deputies voted once again -- another failure. During the break 
the factions left for a conference, the State Duma Council met, 
and acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin was summoned. 
However, his arguments that the Central Bank cannot give credits 
and that there will be no money to pay for deliveries to 
northern areas, the harvest, and so forth did not convince the 
people's representatives -- the budget fell 43 votes short of 
approval. It was then that Ivan Rybkin delivered a fiery 
diatribe and demanded that those "stuck in the smoking room, 
giving interviews, and so forth" be brought back. However, the 
only person to respond -- and even he only responded by 
telephone -- was Anatoliy Sliva, chairman of local 
self-government committee, who said that, though he was sick, he 
would come to the Friday meeting to attend the fourth vote on 
the budget. 
  It is doubtful, however, that all deputies will follow 
Anatoliy Sliva's noble impulse -- on Friday the next match of 
the Russian soccer team at the World Cup will be aired on 
television during the daytime.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Taranov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun--Today the Russian State Duma 
examined the issue of the Russian president's decree "On Urgent 
Measures to Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other 
Kinds of Organized Crime". In his report, Viktor Ilyukhin, 
chairman of the Security Committee, said that the most resolute 
struggle against crime should be mounted. He believes, however, 
"illegality cannot be used to fight illegality." 
  In his address to State Duma deputies, First Deputy Interior 
Minister Mikhail Yegorov noted that the painful process of 
forming new economic structures is under way in the country. 
"The law enforcement bodies know very well who the leaders of 
the criminal world are," the general said. "And, in this 
respect, the presidential decree makes it possible to deal with 
them. We are not going to detain anybody for 30 days. Give us 
at least a month. I assume the entire responsibility for 
implementing the decree." 
  Finally, the State Duma adopted a decision to: 
  1. Draw the Russian Supreme Court's attention to the need to 
observe the Russian Constitution and relevant legislation when 
examining specific criminal cases; 
  2. Confirm the fact that norms of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure are fully in force in the Russian Federation; 
  3. Have the State Duma Committees for Security, Legislation, 
and Legal and Judicial Reform submit to the State Duma for 
examination within two weeks the following draft federal laws: 
"On Combating Organized Crime"; "On the Fight Against 
Corruption"; "On State Protection for Victims of Crime, 
Witnesses, and Other Persons Assisting Legal Proceedings"; "On 
State Protection for Judges, Officials and Law Enforcement 
Bodies"; "On Russian Federation Counterintelligence Bodies"; "On 
the State of Emergency"; "On Keeping in Custody People Suspected 
and Accused of Crimes"; "On the Russian Federation 
Constitutional Court"; and "On State Service"; 
  4. Invite the Federal Assembly's Federation Council, the 
president, and the Russian Government to participate in debating 
and improving the above laws in order to speed their passage 
through the Russian Federal Assembly and their signing by the 
Russian president. 
  5. Recommend to the Russian president to refrain from 
bringing into force Decree No. 1226 of 14 June 1994 "On Urgent 
Measures for Protecting the Population From Gangsterism and 
Organized Crime" in order to bring it in line with the Russian 
Constitution and to submit a draft criminal code, draft code of 
criminal procedure, and draft code of criminal execution of the 
Russian Federation to the State Duma as soon as possible.

  [Text] The State Duma's factions are against the idea of 
extending parliament. 
  Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Union of December 12 Boris 
Fedorov categorically opposes this idea. He told INTERFAX that 
it was illegal and that he would resign on the day stated in the 
Constitution -- December 12, 1995 -- whether or not a decision 
on the issue was taken. 
  Leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
believes that the deputies' powers may be extended, if his party 
is given a chance to form a government. Otherwise, early 
presidential and parliamentary elections must be held, he said. 
  Vice-Chairman of the Communists of Russia faction Viktor 
Zorkaltsev said that the proposal on postponing parliamentary 
elections was unethical. As the State Duma was elected for two 
years, he said, it had no moral right to vote for the extension 
of its powers. "Electors will not understand us," he said. 
  Representative of the Russia's Choice faction Aleksandr 
Osovtsev views this proposal as an attempt to "buy" deputies. 
"One can't change the rules either during the game or after it, 
when a certain result has been achieved. This is not a 
gentlemanly practice," he said. 
  In his opinion, the alignment of forces in the bodies of 
state authority following the elections on December 12, is 
"accidental rather than logical" and that new elections must be 
held. 
  Member of the Yabloko faction Viktor Sheynis said that the 
idea of suspending parliamentary elections was immoral, and 
expressed hope that even the deputies who wanted to have their 
powers extended would not dare to ruin their reputation by 
supporting this idea. 
  In his opinion, the State Duma is not likely to provide two 
thirds of the votes necessary for changing the Constitution. 
  Deputy Gennadiy Burbulis, who withdrew from Russia's Choice 
faction recently, said that extending parliament was possible. 
He believes, however, that the most important thing is to 
ensure the stability of the current course, not to extend the 
deputies' powers. 
  Burbulis also said that the question of extending the 
president's term in office might be raised on the condition that 
Boris Yeltsin pledged not to run for the presidency in 1998.

discussion of the Partnership for Peace [PFP] programme in the 
parliament before signing it. 
  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma Committee for 
International Relations, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday that the 
deputies received the text of the programme only a few hours 
before Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed it in 
Brussels today. 
  He said that President Boris Yeltsin recommended setting up 
working groups in the Federation Council, the upper house of 
parliament, with the participation of State Duma deputies to 
discuss the programme. However the Foreign Ministry had failed 
to arrange such discussions. "That's not the way for 
democratically minded people to treat the parliament," Lukin 
said.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Koretskiy report: "Deputies on Kaliningrad </F>
Oblast. Immanuel Kant's Homeland: The Struggle of the Ideal and 
the Material"] 
  [Excerpts] The problems of Kaliningrad Oblast do not allow 
politicians a minute's peace. Recently, the enclave was visited 
with a great fanfare by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who spoke at 
length about its strategic importance. However, Kaliningrad is 
also the district that gave the Federation Council its chairman, 
Vladimir Shumeyko. He ran there under the slogan of setting up 
a free economic zone, and an edict on creating it was signed by 
the president right after the votes were counted. Yesterday, 
the oblast's problems came to the attention of joint, carefully 
organized hearings of State Duma and Federation Council 
committees. Their leitmotiv was the politically low-risk, albeit 
hardly new, idea of making the oblast Russia's economic, 
political, and military outpost. [passage omitted] 
  The Kaliningrad hearings could not, however, be contained 
within the limits of a purely economic discussion. Sensational 
reports were heard that Germany, Lithuania, and even Belarus 
have been recently calling -- so far unofficially -- for postwar 
borders to be redrawn, implying primarily Kaliningrad Oblast's 
alienation from Russia. The problem of having an enclave and 
protecting national interests finally came to dominate the 
statements of nearly all speakers. Historical exposes were also 
to be heard. One of the popular theses was that neither 
Lithuania (which has never owned Klaipeda and, moreover, 
received Vilno [Vilnius] only from the USSR), nor Germany, which 
lost the war, has the right to lay claim to the former East 
Prussia. A Foreign Ministry representative, who did not wish to 
keep aloof from the debate, recalled that it was Germany that 
sponsored the well-known resolution by the European Parliament 
on Kaliningrad in February. It stressed the enclave's "special 
nature" and emphasized the need to give it the right to forge 
direct ties with European structures. The Foreign Ministry, 
however, did not manage to avoid criticism. It was taken to 
task by the deputies for "bungling the opportunity" of granting 
extraterritorial status to the railroad connecting the oblast 
with the rest of Russia. 
  The main result of the hearings was the recommendation to 
both parliament chambers that the drafting of a law on a special 
status for Kaliningrad Oblast should be considered a priority in 
their lawmaking activity in 1994. It cannot be ruled out that 
the consideration of the bill may acquire dialectical features: 
"Kantian idealism" (that is, political rhetoric) may sweep the 
State Duma owing to Zhirinovskiy's efforts, while entirely 
"Marxist materialism" may gain the upper hand (with Shumeyko's 
blessing) in the Senate.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun (TASS) -- The State Duma today 
adopted a law "On the Russian Federation's external borrowings 
and state credits granted to foreign states by the Russian 
Federation". The law defines the concepts of Russia's state 
external borrowings and state credits granted to foreign states 
by the Russian Federation. It establishes the procedure for the 
adoption of decisions on state external borrowing by the Russian 
Federation and the granting of state credits to foreign states 
by the Russian Federation. The law provides that international 
agreements of the Russian Federation on state external 
borrowings by Russia and the granting of state credits to 
foreign states by Russia are subject to ratification, if the 
amount of the funds being borrowed or granted under the 
agreement exceeds 100 million dollars.

  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS--Russia's minimum monthly wage 
will rise to 20,500 roubles (about ten USD) from 14,620 roubles. 
The corresponding law, taking to effect from July 1, was 
adopted today by the State Duma (lower house) of the Russian 
parliament. 
  The new minimum wage in the state-run sector will be 
provided 
by corresponding budget sources, whereas all other companies and 
agencies should ensure it from their own sources, the law stated. 
  Labour Minister Gennadiy Melikyan, speaking before the Duma, 
noted that only 3.5 per cent of Russians live off the minimum 
wage. According to the minister, the survival minimum (what the 
West calls poverty line--TASS) for Russia amounts now to 72 
thousand roubles. 
  The new law is to be submitted for approval to the 
Federation 
Council (upper house) of the Russian parliament.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Anokhin: "Mutiny on Board the PRES. Will </F>
Konstantin Zatulin Remain Duma Committee Chairman?"] 
  [Text] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of a State Duma 
committee, has announced his resignation from the post of senior 
secretary of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] 
faction. Among the many reasons which prompted him to do this 
he mentioned "the impossibility of collectively formulating, 
discussing, and implementing party policy in a serious way." In 
Zatulin's opinion its most serious problem as of today is the 
question "with whom and against whom the PRES will be in future 
presidential and parliamentary elections." He expressed his 
fear in the words of Solzhenitsyn: "There is a risk that the 
party could remain the Moscow entourage of its ambitious leader 
and that its members could inherit the lot of hostages in a 
political game they do not understand." 
  The discord among the faction's leaders has immediately 
raised the following question point-blank: Will Zatulin 
continue to head the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With 
Compatriots, or will the PRES try to replace him with a more 
reliable representative of its own? Faction member Sergey 
Shulgin, chairman of the Duma subcommittee for tax and customs 
legislation, prefers to call what has occurred not a split but a 
redistribution of duties -- Zatulin has been extremely heavily 
burdened with Duma committee matters. Nevertheless, Shulgin 
said, "I am surprised by Zatulin's words concerning Sergey 
Shakhray's 'dictatorial' ways. Rather, it is the author of the 
reproaches himself who suffers from this. Shakhray is quite a 
democratic man. When he attends sessions of the faction -- 
which rarely happens -- he conducts them evenhandedly and 
properly, taking account of all opinions. If Zatulin does leave 
the faction, he is not obliged to quit the chairmanship of the 
State Duma committee. We voted against making deputies' 
mandates imperative. We should proceed from the premise that 
Zatulin's nomination may have brought a certain percentage of 
votes to the PRES in the elections and helped our candidates 
into parliament." 
  Sergey Shapovalov, chairman of the State Duma Committee for 
Federation and Regional Policy Affairs, is convinced that it is 
a question of conflicts over certain political questions which 
are being decided within the association. The question of 
whether the PRES representative should hold the chairmanship of 
the Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties With Compatriots should 
he leave the deputies' faction is a complex one. The State Duma 
statute contains no legal rules defining such actions. When we 
voted en bloc for the chairmen and deputy chairmen of 
committees, Shapovalov said, we did not envisage such a turn of 
events. An amendment must now be made, because this problem 
could arise in other factions as well. "Personally I believe 
that if a `party' deputy leaves a faction, the faction is 
entitled to raise in the Duma the question of replacing him with 
another member of the faction. Otherwise this will destroy the 
mechanism for pursuing party policy in parliament."

  [Text] After long preparations Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev signed a frame document of the NATO Partnership 
for Peace program in Brussels today, an INTERFAX special 
correspondent Dmitriy Voskoboynikov reports from Brussels. 
  At the same time Kozyrev urged not to make a fetish of any 
forms of military and political cooperation between the West and 
the East. 
  Speaking in the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Kozyrev said 
that Russia was seeking not only partnership but also 
development of contacts within the scope of the North Atlantic 
Council and within the scope of bilateral relations between 
Moscow, the NATO countries and the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council. 
  Kozyrev said the main point was not to limit cooperation in 
the sphere of defense for geographical reasons, not to create 
any new separating barriers on the continent and not to make 
anyone feel isolated. He stressed that cooperation in the 
sphere of defense was high on the European agenda. 
  Kozyrev said that establishment of a unified Europe remained 
Russia's prior goal and stated that the principles and standards 
of the CSCE completely conformed with this goal. The CSCE was 
playing and will play the central role on the continent, Kozyrev 
said when arguing with those who assigned primary importance to 
NATO. 
  The parties circulated a protocol as a result of the talks 
with the participation of the Russian minister in the NATO 
headquarters. The protocol said that Russia and NATO agreed to 
work out a wide particular program for partnership conforming 
with the scale, capacities and significance of Russia. 
  Constructive cooperation between Russia and NATO based on 
mutual respect, mutual benefits and friendship is a key 
component of security and stability in Europe conforming with 
the interests of the CSCE other member-states, the protocol 
stressed. 
  The protocol said that Russia's signing of the Partnership 
for Peace program would give new big opportunities for 
development of relations through practical cooperation in the 
spheres covered by the frame document. 
  The parties agreed to continue to develop far going 
cooperation between Russia and NATO both within and beyond the 
scope of the Partnership for Peace program, the protocol said. 
  The protocol stressed that such relations would be developed 
in order to pursue common goals and to enlarge and enhance 
relations with all other countries, were not aimed against the 
interests of any third countries and would be transparent. 
  Russia and NATO also agreed to continue and to enhance wide 
dialogue and cooperation in those spheres where, given Russia's 
status of a great nuclear power, Russia could make a unique and 
important contribution. This concerned exchange of information 
on the policy of security in European dimension, political 
consultations and cooperation in the sphere of security. 
  Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in 
his 
message to State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin that he believed that 
this protocol would overlap the scope of the NATO Partnership 
for Peace program. 
  Ivanov stressed that since the NATO leadership had decided 
to 
sign the protocol, this meant that it recognized the 
particularity of relations with Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko: "We Become Partners in </F>
European Security"] 
  [Text] In Brussels yesterday at the NATO headquarters 
Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the 
framework document of the "partnership for peace" program and 
the bilateral "Russia-NATO" protocol which proclaims at official 
level the sides' agreement to cooperate in the political, 
military, and military-technical fields. 
  Commenting on this event, the head of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry explained that it is a case of the two programs 
starting simultaneously. One of them, "Russia-NATO," reflects 
Russian priorities in cooperation with the alliance while the 
other, NATO's "partnership for peace," reflects the North 
Atlantic Alliance's proposals which have been accepted by the 
Russian side. The two programs, Kozyrev said, do not contradict 
each other but on the contrary supplement each other. 
  It is symbolic that the ceremony of Russia's accession to 
the 
"partnership for peace" program took place 22 June, on the 
anniversary of the start of the Great Patriotic War, one of 
whose results was the world's division into two opposing camps. 
Having become the West's partner in European and global 
security, Russia has thus overcome one more frontier on the path 
toward a civilized world community. Here, NATO Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino stressed, Russia is the only superpower 
in Europe and it will continue to retain this status. Without 
it it is impossible to achieve success in building a new, secure 
Europe.

  [Text] Russia does not rule out that at a certain stage it 
may join NATO, just like any other country, however, it believes 
it should be in no hurry to do so, Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has said. He was speaking at a news conference in 
Brussels following his talks with the U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
  Kozyrev said that "Partnership for Peace" was enough to 
develop cooperation with that alliance. 
  Kozyrev said that at his talks with the U.S. Secretary of 
State six questions were discussed -- President Yeltsin's visit 
to the United States scheduled for late September, the G-7 
summit in Naples next month, the UN Security Council's draft 
resolution on North Korea's nuclear program and situations in 
Latvia and Estonia, and Bosnia. 
  Kozyrev said that the sides had proved to have close or 
identical attitudes to all fundamental aspects of the North 
Korean nuclear problem. "Our representatives in New York are 
still to do some editing", Kozyrev said. 
  As he answered questions, Kozyrev warned that sanctions 
against North Korea would be inevitable in 30 days unless that 
country took positive steps to meet the international community 
half-way. He said North Korea should be helped by convening an 
international conference. 
  About the Baltic countries the Russian Foreign Minister said 
Latvia had adopted laws that do not hold water. 
  As for Estonia, there might be an early agreement on the 
withdrawal of troops from that country on the condition Tallinn 
displayed goodwill. 
  About Bosnia Kozyrev said that the liaison group was to meet 
in session on June 28 to produce a plan for a settlement in 
Bosnia. 
  He said that the liaison mission would use the stick and 
carrot policy towards the warring factions.

The forms of cooperation comprise exchange of information, 
holding political consultations as necessary, and interaction on 
the whole range of security issues, including those in the 
sphere of maintaining peace. The sides agreed to prepare a 
broad individual partnership program that would correspond to 
Russia's size, importance, and potential.

  [Text] Brussels June 22 TASS -- "Russia and NATO have taken 
the first step towards building up their relations, searching 
for new formulas of ensuring European stability and security," 
said Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He addressed a 
session of the NATO Council devoted to the adoption of documents 
regulating relations between Russia and the North Atlantic 
alliance. 
  Kozyrev pointed out that the preparation of a programme of 
broad cooperation between NATO and Russia has begun on the basis 
of proposals earlier submitted by Russia. A special protocol 
says that this will be a programme, meeting the dimensions and 
significance of Russia's potential. "An agreement has been 
reached on a broad, deep dialogue and cooperation in areas where 
Russia is capable of making a unique and important contribution 
which conforms to Russia's prestige and responsibility as the 
biggest European, world and nuclear state," Kozyrev said. 
  Accepting NATO's proposals, Russia is officially joining the 
Partnership for Peace initiative. Taking part in its 
realisation as equal partners are both states which were 
adversaries in the period of cold war, or neutral countries 
balancing between the two blocs. Such broad participation 
creates prerequisites for further evolution of the European 
situation in the direction of strengthening mutual understanding 
and ensuring an equal level of security for all countries. For 
all its importance, "the Partnership for Peace" is only one 
direction for establishing military-political interaction, 
Kozyrev said. 
  Another direction includes activities along the lines of the 
Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), whose potential, 
in Russia's opinion, should be more actively used, in 
particular, in its peace-keeping activities. 
  The third direction is the development of a system of 
bilateral contacts between Russia, NATO and NACC, which will 
include peace- keeping activities, joint maneuvers, cooperation 
in conversion. These directions "fit the framework of the common 
choice in favour of cooperation and the formation of a really 
single space of security from Vancouver to Vladivostok," Kozyrev 
said. In conclusion, the Russian foreign minister pointed out 
that all efforts should pursue a priority goal -- the creation 
of single Europe. "The key role on the continent is being played 
and will be played by the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE). This is where Russia's opinion and the 
alliance' assessments coincide," Kozyrev said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin left for Greece on Thursday morning. He is due to take 
part in the meeting of the heads of state and government of the 
member countries of the European Union which is to be held on 
the island of Corfu. The Russian president is expected to sign 
an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and 
the European Union. 
  For the first time in the history of the European Union, a 
Russian president will attend its summit, take part in its work 
and sign an agreement which is designed to bring closer the 
countries of the once-split European continent. 
  Boris Yeltsin will also be present at the state dinner which 
Greek Prime-Minister Andreas Papandreou will give in honour of 
the heads of state and government of the countries-members of 
the European Union. 
  The signing of an agreement with the European Union does not 
mean for Russia an automatic membership of this prestigious 
club, Boris Yeltsin said at a press conference in the Kremlin 
ahead of his trip to Corfu. But it will certainly mark the 
first step made by the European Community since the fall of the 
Iron Curtain towards the recognition of Russia as a full-fledged 
partner in the political and economic spheres. 
  The signing of the agreement provides for free trade between 
the European Union and Russia from 1998, if Russia fulfills a 
number of obligations before its partners. The European Union 
will grant Russia the benefits now enjoyed by its member 
countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Russia's way towards cooperation with the European Union was 
and remains far from smooth. Russia was granted the right to 
sign an accord with the European Union a short time ago after 
France lifted its objections to the sale of Russian uranium on 
the external market and President Yeltsin signed a decree 
allowing foreign banks into Russia. Many more barriers will 
have to be cleared before Russia becomes a full-fledged 
participant in the club.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 June -- Boris Yeltsin described the 
forthcoming signing of the agreement between the Russian 
Federation and the European Union as a first tactical step by 
means of which Russia "comes to Europe." Flying to Greece 
today, where a sitting of the European Union will take place, 
Boris Yeltsin told journalists with satisfaction that henceforth 
discriminatory measures vis-a-vis Russia "when we were not given 
quotas for the export of goods have been overcome." 
  In the Russian President's view, the agreement between the 
Russian Federation and the European Union notes the transitional 
nature of the Russian Federation's economy. The President added 
that in the United States the transitional nature of the Russian 
economy has not yet been recognized and therefore for the time 
being obstacles for Russian goods have not been abolished. The 
President said that the agreement would create a favored 
treatment for Russian goods in Europe. It could already be said 
now that the new parameters of cooperation and partnership will 
make it possible to expand the export of goods from Russia to 
Europe. 
  First of all Boris Yeltsin stressed that the Agreement 
specifies "how much uranium and aluminum Russia will be able to 
sell on the European market." "Previously we were not allowed 
into Europe with these commodities". In this respect the 
President regards his visit as extremely useful for the Russian 
economy.

  [Text] [Announcer] Russian President Boris Yeltsin flew 
from Moscow to Greece today. He will attend a meeting of heads 
of state and government of the European Union on the island of 
Corfu. 
  [Correspondent A. Dubnov] Before leaving for Corfu Boris 
Yeltsin answered questions from journalists on relations with 
European countries. According to the president, there was 
discrimination against Russia in earlier times, quotas for our 
goods were limited and our foreign economic proposals were 
ignored, but now there is a whole package of proposals with 
specific dates and figures. Boris Yeltsin noted the European 
community had recognized the fact that there was a transitional 
economy in Russia while the United States had refrained from 
recognizing this. 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] A most favored nation status in 
trade has been given to Russia in Europe. This is very 
important, too. Russia is only gaining from this. Finally, this 
is, perhaps, the first practical step by which Russia truly 
enters Europe and deservedly becomes a fully-fledged European 
country. [end recording]

  [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun -- As soon as Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin arrived on the Greek island of Kerkyra 
(Corfu) today, he told journalists at the airport that he was in 
a good and well- disposed mood. 
  Answering a question from ITAR-TASS about the significance 
of 
the forthcoming signing of an agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between Russia and the European Union, Yeltsin 
stressed that this document "signifies the unblocking of 
Russia." He noted that there really had been discrimination 
against Russia, and Europe would be the first to "unblock this 
situation." 
  The Russian president recalled with regret that the United 
States' discriminatory measures against Russia were still in 
force. Among other things, the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment 
still applies.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolai Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] On Thursday morning, President Yeltsin is to fly out 
to Greece to attend the meeting of the European Union leaders 
(June 24 and 25). At 10:00, Friday, he is expected to sign the 
agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the European Union in St. George Church in the 
island of Corfu. 
  Russia's Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told 
Interfax that the agreement was ready for signing. In the 
evening June 23, after the final coordination of the text 
printed in the 10 languages of the signatory states, this 
document will be initialled by the leaders of the delegations 
involved in the talks. 
  Deputy Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Georgiy 
Gabunia announced that the package of the agreement-related 
documents consisted of about 100 pages, including the joint 
declaration and exchange letters. 
  He also said that according to the agreement, the European 
Union would not consider Russia to be a country with a 
state-controlled trade system, but a state with a transitional 
economy. 
  The Ministry's leading expert Maksim Medvedkov told Interfax 
that the agreement had been drafted during intensive talks which 
continued for two years. He also said that serious problems had 
been caused by the European Union's reluctance to ease the 
access of Russian goods to its markets, and by disagreements 
over Russia's uranium exports and the procedure of the European 
Union banks' work in Russia. "These problems have been solved on 
the whole," he said. 
  IF Note: The draft agreement provides for the mutual 
observance of the basic GATT principles with a few exceptions 
reserved for the nuclear materials on which a separate agreement 
will be concluded in 1997. As to the European Union's banks, 
according to the reached compromise, the five banks which have 
been granted the permit to deal with Russian residents, but 
which have not used this right given the Russian president's 
decree on limiting foreign banks' operations (November 1993), 
shall have their rights restored. The rest of the banks will 
carry out limited operations during a lengthy transitional 
period. For instance, the maximum share of foreign capital in 
the Russian banking system will be limited to 12 percent. The 
number of foreign banks' branches will also be limited. 
  Medvedkov said that the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European 
Union set forth the terms for the Russian economy's gradual 
integration with the European economic system. It envisages a 
gradual implementation of the principles of freedom of trade, 
services and the movement of capital, and of the establishment 
and operation of companies. The most favored nation status will 
be granted on a mutual basis. 
  IF Note: The European Union is Russia's biggest economic 
partner. It accounts for 35 percent of Russia's trade turnover 
with foreign countries and 36 percent of the Russian exports.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others] 
  [Text] If in terms of politics the Group of Seven has grown 
into a Group of Eight, in economy this is going to happen only 
when Russia actually becomes an inseparable part of the 
international economic system. This was stated in a Wednesday 
interview with Interfax by Sergey Chestnoy who is in charge of 
economic cooperation with G7 at the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  He said an economic G8 is out of the question now because 
Russia is not a full member of the GATT or the OECD. Neither 
should it be forgotten that Russian economic reforms have still 
a long way to go, Chestnoy said. 
  The diplomat believes the economic G7 can expand to G8 in 
the 
foreseeable future. "If everything goes O.K., such a 
transformation is possible already in three years", he said. 
  The official told Interfax that on July 9 the Naples summit 
is going to discuss economic matters. On the following day it 
will be joined by President Boris Yeltsin and focus on political 
problems, in particular the situation in Bosnia, Iraq, the 
Korean peninsula and Southern Africa. 
  Chestnoy also said that after the political debate the 
leaders of eight countries will focuss on the situation in 
Russia and the progress of reforms. At the end of the meeting 
the Italian representative chairing the meeting is going to make 
a political statement on behalf of the rest stating the main 
points of the debate, the diplomat reported.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Half the Russian Government </F>
Has Moved Temporarily to Washington"] 
  [Text] Washington -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has arrived in Washington to sign agreements which 
have already been prepared with the Americans, to try to smooth 
over differences in other treaties where possible in one and one 
half days of strenuous work, and to give personal encouragement 
to the Russian soccer players before their next match. 
  But there is one more point in the program for his U.S. 
visit. At breakfasts and lunches in a narrow circle to which the 
press will not even be allowed to come close, the most informed 
members of the U.S. Government will listen eagerly to the Moscow 
guest's answers in the hope of learning what is actually 
happening in Russia. 
  In a half-hour meeting with President Bill Clinton scheduled 
for Thursday Chernomyrdin's assessment of the "current moment" 
will take no less time than Russia's application to join the 
"seven," Kim Il-song's bomb, or problems of friendship with 
NATO. The main thing is the economy. On the eve of Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's arrival several respectable newspapers have 
published items which say for the first time that it is quite 
likely that the Russian recession is close to an end and 
Russians will start to live better. It is important for 
Chernomyrdin to place the correct emphases, to maintain faith in 
the Russian reforms, but to avoid exultation which naturally 
makes creditors anxious to get their money back. 
  This is the third session of the "Chernomyrdin-Gore" 
commission, named for its two cochairmen. The U.S. vice 
premier's duties are of a strictly protocol nature while our 
premier is still the all-Russian head of enterprise. That 
reflects the two sides' approaches. The U.S. Administration has 
virtually exhausted its potential for giving us money. The 
verbal resources with which the administration, to give it its 
due, has done everything to attract its businessmen by speaking 
highly of Russia's boundless resources, are also on the verge of 
depletion. So Washington is interested in a selfless, platonic 
exchange. Premier Chernomyrdin, concerned with problems simply 
unknown to his partners, is still worried about the eternal 
question: What will they give? 
  They will give what they promised, but no more than there 
is. 
The administration does not have that much at its disposal: 
space, nuclear power, environmental protection. Joint 
Russian-U.S. committees and commissions have long been wandering 
around all these glades and there is much here which is already 
well trodden. Anything new comes hard. A treaty on the use of 
the Sakhalin island shelf, the so-called "Sakhalin-2," was 
expected. But instead of the treaty there will be a joint 
statement whose commercial value may only emerge at some time in 
the future. And may not emerge at all. 
  Actually, the latest helping of treaties on space and 
rockets 
will be signed. Fierce competition is under way to take part in 
the world telecommunications system and our specialists are 
rushing to extract as much benefit as possible from the fact 
that we still make quite good rockets. 
  But the agreement on halting plutonium-producing reactors 
will very likely not be signed although congratulations on the 
subject have been heard since late March. But money is louder 
than applause. The Russian side claims that the stopping of the 
reactors is in the interests of the world public for which the 
public should pay. The United States, guessing by some seventh 
sense that it is once again a case of dollars from its budget, 
does not object to raising the issue, but says there is no money. 
  At a preliminary press conference a spokesman for the prime 
minister's apparatus noted that "half the government is moving 
to the United States." He has in mind the fact that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin is accompanied by six leading ministers for whose 
transportation a whole two aircraft were required. Russian 
soccer fans will probably approve the arrival of both aircraft 
in Detroit, where we play Sweden on Friday. It is planned that 
Viktor Chernomyrdin who in general does not go to soccer matches 
("because of a lack of time") will on this occasion visit the 
locker room and give our professional soccer players additional 
encouragement. To judge by their game with Brazil only a 
presidential decree will help here. 
  Actually, Bolivian President Sanchez de Lozada, a 
long-standing and passionate fan, did not enter the locker room 
on the eve of the first match of the championship in which the 
national team he worships was taking part. Either they did not 
let him in or he was shy. 
  As for Premier Chernomyrdin he will go, his staffers report, 
to congratulate the players after the match -- if they win. If 
they lose the cortege will go straight from the rostrum to the 
airport to return to Moscow on Saturday morning. 
  The Russian premier will spend all the first half of the day 
at the Chicago headquarters of General Motors. The Russian 
automobile association plans to create capacities for the 
production of new passenger vehicles in conjunction with Opel, 
General Motors' European junior partner. 
  Formally the deal is being concluded between private 
enterprises and the government leader would seem to have nothing 
to do with it. But the Western partners realize how dependent 
any Russian enterprises remain on top officials. So his hosts 
will await with practical interest V. Chernomyrdin's reaction to 
one of the new models. The premier will test its quality in 
motion, getting behind the wheel himself.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Borisenko and Vitaliy </F>
Chukseyev] 
  [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Federation 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President 
Albert Gore -- cochairmen of the Russian-American commission for 
economic and technological cooperation -- marked the signing of 
the project to develop deposits on the Sakhalin shelf with a 
toast to its success. The document, known as Sakhalin-2, was 
signed by Yuriy Shafrannik, the Russian minister of fuel and 
power engineering, (D. Daffind), president of the Sakhalin 
Energy Investment Company, and representatives of the American 
and Japanese firms which formed a consortium to implement this 
major project which promises significant economic benefit to the 
Russian Far East. 
  "The Sakhalin-2 project can truly be called crucial if one 
assesses it from the point of view of its underlying 
principles," Yu. Shafrannik said in a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "For the first time, work on a Russian 
shelf will be carried out by a consortium of Western firms. The 
project is very advantageous for Russia. Almost 70 percent of 
subcontracting work will go to Russian firms and also 25 percent 
of profits. This is a very serious project. If, after such a 
first step we are able to take another -- and of this I am 
certain -- then there will be capital investment in this region 
in the course of the next year and one can expect serious 
changes in the region of the Far East within the next few 
years." In particular, the minister said, some of the gas 
extracted on the Sakhalin shelf could be sent to the mainland. 
  "This project is really crucial," Ronald Brown, U.S. 
Secretary of State for Trade, said in a conversation with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. "I hope that its implementation will 
stimulate development of trade between our countries and open up 
opportunities for capital investment. This project is indeed 
important and, what is most important, it has gotten off to a 
good start."

  [Text] Here is our correspondent Yuriy Rostov on the 
Russian premier's visit to the United States. 
  [Begin Rostov recording] Today Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, 
who arrived in Washington yesterday, took part in the work of 
the American-Russian commission for economic cooperation. 
Chernomyrdin and Vice President Gore are co-chairmen of that 
commission. Today the sides completed discussion of several 
agreements, including the 400 million dollar contract on the 
joint exploration of space and the Sakhalin-2 agreement. The 
latter document envisages the development of yet another sector 
of the Sakhalin oil-bearing shelf. American and Japanese banks 
are planning to invest ten billion dollars in the project. The 
profit over a period of 25 years will be be 50 billion dollars. 
  Last year the session of the Russian-American commission was 
to have been held in June too, although it took place in 
September. This time the session of the commission has started 
on time, just like today's meeting at the U.S. Congress. One of 
the most important subjects discussed was the need to finally 
remove the restrictions in U.S. legislation on trade with Russia 
which has not been communist for a long time now. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Aleksandr Mineyev] 
  [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun -- Russia and the United States 
have today practically agreed the text of a draft UN Security 
Council resolution in connection with the nuclear problem of the 
DPRK. This was announced by Andrey Kozyrev and Warren 
Christopher, the heads of the foreign policy departments of the 
two countries at a news conference in the Russian Embassy in 
Brussels after the talks, which were held here. 
  This joint initiative was discussed on the instructions of 
the presidents of Russia and the United States, Kozyrev said. 
As a result: There has occurred a drawing-together and 
coincidence of approaches on all the fundamental questions, and 
only the drafting work remains for the representatives of the 
two countries in New York. 
  The main aim of this initiative, in the words of the Russian 
minister, is to get the DPRK to observe the regime of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The draft resolution will 
clearly indicate that sanctions against Pyongyang are inevitable 
in about 30 days if the DPRK does not take positive steps. To 
help it take such steps and open the doors to positive movement, 
Kozyrev said, it is proposed to use the opportunity of the 
conference and already in the very near future, send the 
relevant invitations. In this way, these 30 days should be 
used, including by means of convening the conference, in order 
to avoid sanctions which, of course, are an extreme means.

Aleksandr Mineyev] 
  [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun--The heads of the foreign policy 
departments of Russia and the United States noted the importance 
of the work carried out by the contact group that is drafting 
proposals on the territorial demarcation in Bosnia. According 
to Warren Christopher, the group should meet again on 28 June. 
He declared Washington's willingness, if necessary, to hold an 
additional meeting at the ministerial level, attended by Russia, 
the United States, and five countries of the European Union. 
  Christopher said that the international community's 
influence 
on the parties to the conflict to prompt them to accept the 
peace proposals should be based on something like the "carrot 
and stick" principle. For his part, Andrey Kozyrev made it 
clear that work was proceeding within the contact group on a 
list of inducements and sanctions, for cases in which both of 
the antagonists did not agree to accept the settlement plan, or 
if just one of them proved to be uncompromising. 
  The ministers gave different answers to a question about 
abolishing sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro if the 
Bosnian sides agreed to the proposed plan. Kozyrev replied 
affirmatively, while Christopher said that it would depend on 
the contact group's recommendations.

  [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin warned today of the 
danger of a "big war" breaking out in former Yugoslavia. 
Churkin, who is accompanying Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, arrived on this Greek island from Brussels today. The 
two men are to attend the signing of the agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the European Union. 
  It seems to me, he said in response to questions from 
ITAR-TASS, that during July the peoples of former Yugoslavia, 
especially Bosnia, have their last chance to reach agreement. 
If this chance is missed, a big war will result. V. Churkin 
suggested that this big war could start as soon as the summer 
ends. He disclosed that proposals for a settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis which were "unprecedentedly" resolute were about 
to be discussed. If these proposals are not accepted during 
July, a great calamity will result, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Today the Russian 
Foreign Ministry made a statement, which says: 
  "On 21 June 1994 the Latvian Republic's Saeima adopted a 
citizenship law. In its content, it is an unprecedented legal 
act, according to which the overwhelming majority of ethnic 
Russians who reside permanently in that country are in fact 
deprived of a real possibility of obtaining Latvian citizenship. 
  The law contains elements of discrimination on ethnic 
grounds 
and consolidates the principle of quotas for the naturalization 
of Latvia's permanent residents that, in general, is to start in 
2000. Thus, on the threshold of the 21st century, a state that 
claims to be democratic and based of a rule of law, has made yet 
another step towards discrimination in law of hundreds of 
thousands of residents of the Latvian Republic and formation of 
a monoethnic state. 
  Long before the citizenship law had been adopted, by 
depriving "non-indigenous" residents of citizenship, Latvia 
started purposeful discrimination against them in the political, 
social, economic and other spheres by adopting relevant laws and 
statutory instruments. These include the law on elections to 
central and local bodies of power, on civil service, on 
languages, on election campaigning and so on and amendments to 
the laws on entry and foreigners' stay or on the police. These 
have seriously worsened the situation of hundreds of thousands 
of permanent residents, the majority of whom are ethnic 
Russians, and have created a legal basis for introducing 
discriminaton on ethnic, language, religious, and other gounds 
in Latvia. 
  Latvia has been persistently ignoring the real situation in 
the country, fundamental human rights documents, the views of 
international experts, and recommendations by the CSCE high 
commissioner for ethnic minorities, the Council of Europe, and 
the calls of some neighboring states concerning the rights of 
minorities. All this cannot be evaluated otherwise than an open 
challenge to democratic and humanistic traditions in today's 
Europe and world. 
  In this situation the absence of an appropriate 
international 
reaction, let alone the acceptance of the country in the Council 
of Europe, would look as a sign of approval of the Latvian 
authorities' discriminatory policies and would be tantamount to 
the lowering of international and European standards in the 
sphere of human rights. 
  For its part, in accordance with UNGA resolution no. 48/155 
"The situation in the sphere of human rights in Latvia and 
Estonia" and in connection with the further deterioration of the 
situation in the sphere of human rights in the Latvian Republic, 
Russia will resolutely strive to ensure that Latvia complies 
with the international obligations it has taken upon itself. 
  In developing relations with Latvia henceforth the Russian 
side will take account of the situation that is taking shape in 
that country following the adoption of the citizenship law."

described the citizenship act passed in Latvia as inhuman. He 
told Interfax that the act turned numerous residents of Latvia 
into stateless persons, made it impossible for them to become 
citizens and imposed naturalization quotas. 
  He said the law did nothing for the image Latvia was 
striving 
for itself as a stronghold of democracy. 
  Krylov said that the act was aimed against the 
Russian-speaking residents of Latvia. He explained that if it 
became law, Russian- Latvian relations would deteriorate, the 
visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Latvia 
would most likely not take place and numerous agreements made 
during the recent visit of Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis to 
Moscow would be in doubt. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that Russia would lift 
Latvia's most favored nation status. 
  Krylov said he did not believe, however, that the 
citizenship 
act would influence the deadline for the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Latvia. 
  He said that Russia intended to raise the question of human 
rights violations in Latvia in the CSCE and other international 
organizations.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "Paratroopers Named as Chief </F>
Peacekeepers in Transcaucasus"] 
  [Text] The peacekeeping operation which was begun by 
Russian generals and troops subordinate to them in Georgia and 
Abkhazia with a reconnaissance and the introduction into the 
conflict zone of a reinforced engineer-sapper battalion and 
communications and control subunits, has finally acquired 
official, legal status. At a session closed to the press, the 
Russian Federation Council, after hearing a report by Defense 
Minister Army General Pavel Grachev, ratified the president's 
edict on Russian Federation participation in reconciling the 
warring parties. 
  Now the sappers and communications personnel are to be 
followed to the Transcaucasus, to the Georgian-Abkhazian front, 
by paratrooper peacekeepers. But not, admittedly, the officers 
and men of the 345th Parachute Regiment, as was reported 
earlier, but their colleagues from Novorossiysk, Stavropol, and 
Ulyanovsk. The Russian Defense Ministry has accommodated the 
Georgian parliament deputies who believe to this day that the 
"fall" of Sukhumi happened purely because of the participation 
of servicemen from that regiment in the storming of the city and 
object to their presence on the line of disengagement between 
the warring forces. 
  Under the decision agreed by the three sides, the 
paratroopers of the 345th Regiment will stay at their positions 
in Gudauta and Sukhumi and will guard the Bombory military 
airfield and the Moscow Military District Sanatorium, where the 
Joint Staff of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone is already stationed, as well 
as other Russian Army facilities. Major General Vasiliy 
Yakushev is charged with leading the peacekeeping forces. 
  The peacekeeping operation (you can see it in diagrammatic 
form in our drawing) [report is accompanied by a two- by 
two-inch sketch map captioned "Sketch map of the deployment of 
Russian peacekeeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict 
zone"] will cover an area in the region of the Inguri river 56 
km wide and 78 km long. The dividing line between control zones 
one and two will run perpendicular to the present line of 
contact between Georgian and Abkhazian troops along the river. 
  The actual armed formations of the two sides must be drawn 
back from the Inguri river 12 km on each side, so that in the 
event of a strained situation arising, no one can hit his 
adversary with tank or artillery guns, still less mortar or 
machinegun fire (dotted line on the map). 
  The heavy equipment and main forces of the warring parties 
are to go to specially designated areas (indicated on the sketch 
map by broken elliptical lines). For the Abkhaz side these are 
Ochamchira and Meore-Gudava, and for the Georgian side -- the 
eastern suburbs of the cities of Kheta and Senaki (where the 
equipment and arms are to be sited), as well as the city of 
Chkhorotsku (for personnel). 
  In the zones there are five checkpoints for the peacekeeping 
forces, which will regulate the flow of returning refugees -- at 
the destroyed bridge on the Inguri river, among others -- and 
bar the passage of weapons into the security and arms limitation 
zones, plus 22 observation posts on the entire territory of the 
"hot spot" (shown as triangles on the sketch map). Keen 
attention will be paid to Galskiy Rayon, where the refugees are 
mainly expected to return. It is proposed to site as many as 
seven observation posts there. 
  The headquarters of Control Zone No. 1 will be sited in 
Gali, and of Zone No. 2 in Zugdidi. It is proposed to leave up 
to three battalions of peacekeeping forces in each zone. On the 
west bank of the Inguri they will be composite battalions of the 
Batumi Motorized Infantry Division belonging to the 
Transcaucasus Group of Russian Forces. 
  For rapid reaction to explosive situations and incidents, 
four mobile groups are being set up, to which 10 helicopters are 
to be assigned. These groups, consisting of a reinforced 
platoon, will also monitor from the air the Kodorskoye Ravine 
zone, which does not form part of the demilitarized area but 
causes great concern due to the operations of various 
"independent" armed formations there. 
  The plan for the conduct of the operation was not only 
discussed in the Russian Federation Council; the UN mission in 
Georgia is also familiar with it. It was coordinated with 
Lieutenant General Sergey Dbar, chief of general staff of the 
armed forces of Abkhazia, and Major General Guram Nikolaishvili, 
Georgian deputy defense minister. 
  Now it is up to the plan's executors. And not only, or even 
mainly, the Russian peacekeepers. It is a matter of the 
political will of the Georgian and Abkhazian leadershop to 
resolve contentious problems exclusively by peaceful means. 
  According to information at our disposal, the sending of the 
new Russian battalions to the conflict zone and their arrival at 
Gudauta airfield is planned for 22-25 June. This will require 
60 trips by Il-76 and An-22 planes. 
  The anticipated cost of the peacekeeping operation in 
Georgia 
and Abkhazia is 10-11 billion rubles. The officers' and men's 
pay alone (there will be some 3,000 of them) will require 1 
billion every month. At the same time the Federation Council 
rejected the military people's proposal that Russia's "blue 
helmets" be paid for as a separate item in the state budget. 
The Defense Ministry will have to pay for everything. 
  On the first day of work, Russian sappers have already 
rendered harmless 117 mines. Fortunately, there were no 
casualties.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian </F>
deputy minister of defense, under "Topical Subject" rubric: 
"Russia's Peacemaking Role"] 
  [Text] By virtue of the circumstances that have taken 
shape, Russia today finds itself at the center of peacemaking 
activity [mirotvorcheskaya deyatelnost] on the territory of the 
former USSR. In some "hot spots" it remains the only force that 
is actually exercising functions capable of ending fratricidal 
war, separating warring sides, and getting them to sit around 
the negotiating table. 
  An analysis of the situation attests to a significant future 
broadening of the participation of Russian peacemaking subunits 
on the territory of a number of CIS republics. 
  The participation of the Russian Federation, a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, in peacemaking operations is 
determined by norms of international law, by the UN Charter, by 
documents of the Security Council and the CSCE, and, with the 
creation of the Council of CIS Heads of State, by the 
Commonwealth Charter and the Agreement on Groups of Military 
Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces [sily po 
podderzhaniyu mira], which were adopted in Tashkent in May 1992. 
Peacemaking problems were reflected in the Military Doctrine 
adopted in the Russian Federation Security Council, which noted 
for the first time that "Russia assists the efforts of the world 
community and various collective security organs in preventing 
wars and armed conflicts and in maintaining and restoring peace 
and, to this end, deems it necessary to have Armed Forces and 
other troops to conduct peacekeeping operations in accordance 
with a UN Security Council decision or international 
obligations." 
  But the existing legal basis is plainly inadequate. A draft 
law defining the status, composition, maintenance, and functions 
of Russia's peacemaking forces has been submitted to the State 
Duma. The draft law lays down the procedure for providing 
military and civilian personnel of the Russian Federation to 
participate in operations to maintain and restore international 
peace and security and in other kinds of UN peacemaking 
activity, as well as in the fulfillment by the Russian 
Federation of obligations adopted under international treaties 
and agreements, including within the framework of the CSCE and 
the CIS, as defined in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of the UN Charter. 
  Following the State Duma's adoption of the law, it is 
necessary to draw up and adopt the Concept of Russia's 
Participation in Peacemaking Activity and the Statute on the 
Russian Federation's Peacemaking Forces. At the same time two 
or three motorized rifle divisions of the Ground Forces must be 
transferred to the authorized organizational structure of the 
military contingents participating in peacekeeping operations. 
It is proposed, starting in 1995, to relieve the airborne 
troops of peacemaking tasks. Peacemaking force subunits must be 
brought up to full strength, have modern, air-transportable 
hardware with high off-road capabilities, be equipped with light 
armament and means of communication and control, and be supplied 
with the necessary resources to cope with autonomous actions 
lasting two or three months. This hardware must not count 
toward the maximum levels restricted by treaty obligations in 
the European part of Russia. 
  The Russian Ministry of Defense is prepared to take on the 
tasks of manning, training, and equipping military contingents 
of peacemaking forces and military observers and supplying them 
at permanent deployment garrisoning locations, but questions of 
funding are very acute. 
  There are several reasons for this. First, legislation on 
peacemaking has not been created in any of the former republics 
of the USSR. Second, despite the protocol "On the Manning, 
Structure, and Material, Technical, and Financial Support of the 
Group of Military Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces 
in the CIS," which was signed by the CIS heads of state in May 
1992 and which provides for these costs to be borne from 
contributions from the CIS states and the sides involved in a 
conflict, Russia has received nothing. 
  Third, we consider it logical that the world community, in 
tending toward the recognition of Russia as a guarantor against 
the escalation of conflicts to the scale of regional wars, could 
express this support not just in words but also by partially 
covering Russia's expenditure on peacekeeping operations in the 
near abroad out of UN funds. Or else offset this expenditure 
against Russia's subscription to the United Nations for the same 
purposes. During 1993 alone more than 26 billion rubles [R] was 
spent out of the Defense Ministry's budget on the peacemaking 
activities of military contingents. It is perfectly obvious 
that Russia's peacemaking forces must be funded out of the 
federal budget under a separate subhead, while expenditure 
connected with peacemaking activity on the territories of the 
republics of the former USSR must be covered by the CIS states' 
contributions in monetary or other form on a shared basis. 
  A few words about the participation of Russian peacemaking 
forces in the settlement of armed conflicts in the near abroad. 
In accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Russian 
Federation and Moldavia [Moldova] "On the Principles of the 
Peaceful Settlement of the Armed Conflict in the Dniester 
Region" of 23 July 1992, a contingent of the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces was formed on a voluntary basis, consisting 
initially of six battalions, and was sent into the regions of 
the conflict from 23 July through 31 August 1992. Today the 
strength of the peacemaking force there has been reduced. 
Personnel serve in the zone of responsibility between the sides 
involved in the conflict, which has an overall length of 
approximately 225 km and a width of between 4 and 15 km, a 
checkpoint-control regime is being organized, observation posts 
are being set up, mobile groups are being created to patrol 
sectors, important installations are placed under guard, and an 
alert-duty subunit is appointed. 
  Purposeful and concerted actions have resulted in the 
stabilization of the situation in the region and control over 
its development. The blood of peaceful inhabitants is no longer 
being shed, and the talks process relating to the final 
settlement of the conflict by peaceful means is continuing, 
albeit with difficulty. It is clear, however, from a forecast of 
the development of the situation in the Dniester Region that the 
withdrawal of our units and subunits of the peacemaking forces 
appears premature, although the question of a further reduction 
in the quantity of men and equipment in the conflict zone has 
already been raised. A final solution to the conflict situation 
in the region is a matter for the politicians. 
  In South Ossetia a military contingent of the peacemaking 
forces was sent into the conflict zone in July 1992 on the basis 
of "Directives of the Russian Federation Government" in the 
light of the fulfillment of the Dagomys agreements of 24 June 
1992 on settling the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, and it is 
continuing to fulfill its tasks. A complex situation persists 
in the region. Deliveries of food and essential goods from 
Georgia have not been made for a long time. Paper currency has 
been virtually withdrawn from circulation. The crime situation 
is deteriorating. The population has been forced to defend 
itself against robbery and lawlessness. Practically the entire 
adult male population has weapons. 
  A CSCE mission is working in the conflict zone to monitor 
the 
situation and give some humanitarian assistance. A fragile 
stability is being maintained in South Ossetia only thanks to 
the presence of the Russian peacemaking force. If it is 
withdrawn, the situation could instantly get out of control. 
The danger of a further explosion of military confrontation has 
now increased significantly. 
  Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division has been performing 
peacemaking tasks in the Republic of Tajikistan for 
approximately two years. In October 1993 it became part of the 
Collective Peacemaking Forces which had been formed. The 
division is a deterrent factor in the escalation of civil war 
and the conduct of large-scale provocative actions on the 
Tajik-Afghan border. Russia is taking an active part in 
settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani and Georgian-Abkhazian 
conflicts. A peacemaking operation began 14 June in the region 
of the latter. 
  The performance of peacemaking tasks is attended by daily 
risk to servicemen's lives and is carried out under conditions 
of unceasing provocations from both sides. Isolation from the 
permanent deployment garrisoning locations, the growth of 
antiarmy and anti-Russian feeling among the local population, 
and the lengthy stay in a zone of conflict (state of emergency) 
rightly arouse the concern of servicemen. But the greatest 
concern is aroused by the peacemaking forces' lack of status, 
the vagueness of their rights and obligations, and the poor 
social and legal provision: the low pay and remuneration, poor 
life and health insurance, and lack of privileges in the 
provision of housing. 
  Despite this, today Russia's Armed Forces play the paramount 
role in maintaining peace and stability and in settling 
conflicts. But the success of any peacemaking action depends on 
the military contingent's qualitative training and on careful 
planning. To these ends we have set up training centers in the 
27th and 45th Guards' Motorized Rifle Divisions. But the 
training facilities do not yet make it possible to fully train 
personnel. It is necessary to improve them, but again the 
matter is being held up by funding. 
  Russia actively participates in theoretical elaborations and 
consultations on peacemaking activity with various international 
organizations (United Nations, CSCE, North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, NATO, and others), including on a bilateral basis with 
interested countries. This year it is planned to hold the first 
Russian-U.S. joint command and staff exercise of the Russian 
Federation's 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S. 
3d Infantry Division. Their chief aim is to define mutually 
acceptable approaches to the planning of troop operations and 
organizing collaboration between units and subunits when 
conducting a peacekeeping operation. It is also proposed to 
rehearse questions of troop control during such operations, to 
work out unified sets of documents and views on operating 
tactics, and to enhance the subunits' readiness to operate as 
part of coalition peacekeeping forces in "hot spots." 
  But the mass media and individual politicians have recently 
been fueling passions over the upcoming exercise. The polemic 
is undoubtedly being conducted by uninformed people, for the 
purpose of misleading public opinion. On 16 March 1994 PRAVDA 
published the article "Our Strategists Are Too Ingenuous" by 
Major General Viktor Chudov, retired. The article contains a 
number of gross distortions. In particular, it maintains that a 
full division on each side will be involved in the measure. The 
author casts doubt on the military-political advisability of the 
exercise and on the whole package of Russian-U.S. relations in 
the military sphere. The article attempts to link the upcoming 
exercise to a U.S. desire to introduce its own armed contingent 
onto Russian soil and to assimilate a new theater of military 
operations. 
  The article's author distorted the scale and nature of the 
planned exercises. It is planned to conduct not a troop 
exercise but merely a command and staff exercise involving up to 
250 people on each side and automotive equipment. The upcoming 
exercise is regarded as a real contribution by our countries to 
the preparation and conduct of peacemaking operations. The 
initiative for holding it came from the Ministry of Defense, and 
the presidents of Russia and the United States announced it back 
in September 1993. 
  Several versions of a command and staff exercise were 
considered. The U.S. military proposed holding it on U.S. 
territory, but the U.S. side was unable to take on all the 
costs, including the transfer of hardware and personnel. Such 
expenditure was unacceptable to us. A proposal to hold the 
exercise on FRG territory -- the stationing location of the U.S. 
3d Infantry Division -- did not meet with understanding on the 
German side. Therefore the territory of the Totskoye Range -- 
the stationing location of the 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle 
Division -- was chosen. This means minimal expenditure for our 
side -- approximately R100 million. 
  The U.S. Congress is allocating $5 million just to transfer 
69 units of automotive equipment and 250 personnel from Germany 
(city of Wuerzburg). 
  The U.S. side is prepared to pay for the Russian side's work 
and services in preparing for the joint command and staff 
exercise -- equipping the checkpoint and the motor vehicle pool, 
refueling hardware, "damages" to the ecology, etc. -- in the sum 
of R0.5 billion. If the command and staff exercise were held on 
U.S. territory, our side's transport costs alone would increase 
by a factor of four or five times. 
  If we were to abandon the holding of the joint exercise, as 
individual politicians demand, Russia would not fulfill its 
promises and would lose the confidence of the world public. And 
yet the exercises are the most humane and noble. 
  On the basis of an analysis of the Totskoye exercise and of 
additional coordination, and given the adoption of political 
decisions, the next joint command and staff exercise or training 
session will take place on U.S. territory. 
  Under conditions wherein the CIS states are pursuing a 
policy 
of strict neutrality, displaying no interest in resolving armed 
conflicts using their own forces, Russia remains the only state 
with the military and political potential to conduct operations 
to maintain and restore peace -- which it confirms by its 
practical activity. Russia's peacemaking role is a natural one. 
For decades the peoples of the former USSR lived as a single 
family, and a tight knot of interrelations was tied which had 
both achievements and problems. This was the result of joint 
efforts by all the peoples and ethnic groups of the USSR who had 
earlier linked their fate with Russia. It is now the latter's 
duty to do everything to ensure that the former members of one 
family are not at odds with each other. 
  Russia has historically been a guarantor of other peoples' 
reconciliation and has always come to their assistance at a 
difficult time. In all conflict situations it has so far been 
perceived as a kinsman, not as a stranger. It is considerably 
simpler for it to get to the bottom of what is happening and to 
influence reconciliation. It directs its main effort into 
settling crisis situations in regions in direct proximity to its 
borders, since stability and peace on these territories are of 
vital importance to Russia and its citizens, 25 million of whom 
live in states in the near abroad. It was and still is the only 
force capable of fulfilling these tasks. Life itself suggests 
that no international organization or group of states will take 
the place of Russia's peacemaking efforts on the territory of 
the former USSR.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- With presidential elections in 
Belarus being just a day away, one of the leading candidates 
Vyacheslav Kebich, chairman of republican council of ministers, 
has arrived in Moscow. A meeting between Vyacheslav Kebich and 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets is on the list of 
today's activities for Russia's top government officials. 
  The Russian government office is not saying much about the 
content of the meeting which took place behind closed doors. 
One can assert that the Russian Cabinet of Ministers likes one 
of the election promises of the Belarusian prime minister, 
namely his intention to introduce "tax holidays" for Russian 
goods which are not going to be taxed. 
  It is thought that Vyacheslav Kebich will be received in the 
Kremlin since Boris Yeltsin made it clear at a press conference 
on 10 June that Russia is "very much" interested in the Belarus 
election results. It is obvious who Russia would like to see as 
the head of Belarus.

  [Text] A deputy of the Russian State Duma, ex-chairman of 
the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) Supreme Soviet 
Anatoliy Lukyanov said he believed that there was no alternative 
to a renewed Union. 
  On Tuesday he took part in the meeting in the Belarussian 
Academy of Geo-Politics which was holding an international 
conference "Russia and Belarus - the way to the future" in 
Minsk. 
  Lukyanov told Interfax that his visit to Minsk was aimed at 
expressing support to those forces standing for expansion of 
Russian-Belarussian cooperation and defending the idea of 
restoration of a renewed Union. 
  "My visit has absolutely nothing to do with the coming 
presidential elections in Belarus," Lukyanov stressed. 
  He said that the mechanism for restoration of the Union was 
created when 19 communist parties were set up in the ex- Soviet 
republics. Lukyanov said that the congress of the USSR peoples 
planned for this September was also expected to contribute to 
establishment of a mass movement for restoration of the Union. 
  Lukyanov spoke in favor of participation of Russian and 
Belarussian parliamentarians in the hearings on the results of 
the implementation of the Belaya Vezh agreement which will be 
held in the State Duma Committee on CIS in early July.

Pavel Grachev, the Strategic Nuclear Forces -- the Strategic 
Rocket forces, the Naval and Air Force strategic nuclear forces 
-- are a realistic guarantee of ensuring Russia's security in 
modern circumstances and will remain a major deterrent against

nuclear forces will be a priority in the formation of the

To Speak Russian"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- U.S. State Department specialists 
studying the problem of illegal immigration consider that Russia 
has become a new center for the Chinese mafia's activities. 
They estimate that around 60,000 Chinese are presently waiting 
their turn to cross over to the countries of Europe and America 
from Russia. 
  But the Americans complain that it is difficult to work with 
the Russian authorities as the latter show no interest in this 
problem. Russian border guards are easily bought off and they 
agree to let illegal immigrants through the border. Nobody 
wants to be involved in sending immigrants back to China. State 
Department representatives are going to discuss these problems 
in the next few days with their Russian colleagues in Moscow.

  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has said in a 
televised interview the latest changes he made to the structure 
of executive government and the personnel reshuffles in the 
cabinet were linked with what he described as a new anti-crisis 
policy developed by the government. 
  President Nazarbayev said the anti-crisis program would be 
discussed in parliament in a few days and then approved by the 
President. 
  President Nazarbayev said the government of Kazakhstan had 
proposed a "team prepared to act on it." He said he had agreed 
with the proposed reorganization of ministries, personnel 
changes to the cabinet and the leadership of some ministries and 
authorities in regions and in the capital 
  President Nazarbayev believes that "new, younger people 
having a good idea of what business and economic reform are 
about have joined the Cabinet". In particular, he emphasized 
the appointment of 40-year-old Kozykorpesh Yesenberlin as 
Chairman of the State Property Committee and 32-year-old 
Galymzhan Zhakiyanov as head of the Semipalatinsk regional 
administration. Both have a record of work in "commercial 
structures." 
  President Nazarbayev said that the government would be given 
carte blanche for 15 months to act on the program, and the 
presidential staff and the president himself would closely 
monitor progress in its implementation. The future of the 
government will be decided upon the end of the term. "If the 
program is not implemented, the Cabinet will resign," President 
Nazarbayev said.

  [Text] Almaty 22 June TASS -- I tried to make sure that new 
competent officials come forth to lead, who know what is 
business, banking system and today's reforms, President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said talking to ITAR-TASS. 
He was commenting upon serious changes made in the Republic's 
power body structures and reshuffles during the past short 
period. 
  "Lately the government was working out a programme of its 
actions which will be presented to the Supreme Soviet. Under 
the new programme, the new government will form a team and 
together with it carry out the programme," the Kazakh president 
said. According to Nazarbayev, among reappointed ministers and 
chiefs of departments are mainly those who took part in 
preparing the programme. 
  Nazarbayev also said that the president's office will 
strictly monitor the fulfillment of the programme proposed to 
the government. There is nothing to be surprised at, Nazarbayev 
emphasised. According to him, in all civilized democratic 
countries of the world every government comes forward with a 
definite programme which it puts before the society. The people 
accept it and allot time to fulfill it. Together with the fate 
of such a programme the fate of the government is also decided. 
If the government is able to cope with its work, it is normal. 
If the government does not fulfill its promises, it must 
resign, the Kazakh president said.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry noted an article published 
recently in [name indistinct] a Russian newspaper titled "Russia 
Has Become a Testing Site for Exotic Spies." It contains a 
reference to a statement made by Baturin, assistant to the 
Russian president on national security, who doubted the ability 
of our republic to control its borders properly with China. The 
Foreign Ministry press service is obligated to inform relevant 
parties that in accordance with the information given by 
reliable sources, illegal attempts to cross the border are not 
numerous. Transgressors are usually always detained. As far as 
border control is concerned, a visa agreement on traveling 
between Kazakhstan and China, which envisages the need for 
exit-entry visas for trips by citizens of both Kazakhstan and 
China, was concluded. Such conclusions on the ability of an 
independent country to defend its borders should be based on 
facts, the more so because the Republic's relevant services 
exchange border information on a regular basis with the 
leadership of the Russian border troops.

  [Text] Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Sergey Tereshchenko 
told parliament on Thursday [23 Jun] that Kazakhstan had run out 
of money to continue the economic restructuring program. 
  He said that economic restructuring was unthinkable without 
foreign loans and that a preparatory period of about 15 months 
was needed to secure them. 
  The government is proposing a three-stage program, said 
Tereshchenko. In June to December 1995, the main accent will be 
put on domestic resources, the rate of inflation will be lowered 
to about 10 percent and relative stabilization of the national 
currency will be attained. 
  From January to September 1995, the government intends to 
secure a medium-term credit, accelerate integration with Russia 
and the CIS countries, and receive loans from the G7. 
  The third stage will mark the beginning of a new economic 
course, he said. Foundations for enhancing the population's 
living standards and promoting industrial production will be 
laid. The government will continue to pursue a tough 
anti-inflation policy, lower taxes, carry out a banking reform 
and accelerate privatization. 
  Tereshchenko said that "one could no longer implement reform 
without financing the social sphere." "Otherwise, reforms will 
be resisted," he said. 
  He also said that the national funds must be spent with care 
and urged the parliament to support the government-proposed 
budget. "If we manage to implement a tough budget, the task of 
securing foreign loans will be much easier," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 June (ITAR-TASS) -- "Earlier or later we 
shall arrive at an alliance [words indistinct] Euro-Asian union. 
It had better be done now, without bloodshed and fighting, 
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan said in an interview 
published by the MOSCOW NEWS weekly [no end quotes, as received]. 
  "Within the European Community small countries secured a 
position for themselves in which bigger countries are allowed 
less dictate," he said. "This is the aim of the European Union. 
I understand why certain circles in Russia are opposed to 
Nazarbayev's idea -- it is easier to dictate when the 
Commonwealth is in its present state, within a union, account 
must be taken of the interests of smaller states [sentence as 
received]. But there is no alternative, the way of dictatorship 
will inevitably make Russia weaker," Akayev said. 
  "Russia is a priority direction of our foreign policy. 
Unfortunately, trade and economic relations with the Russian 
Federation are shrinking, it now ranks third after Kazakhstan 
and Uzbekistan. But even when we do not meet with reciprocity, 
we can look only to Russia for protection. We were among the 
first to support the establishment of the collective security 
council within the frame of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States." 
  "While among the former Soviet republics we lean on Russia 
for support, beyond this boundaries great moral support comes 
from the United States. The United States is the main donor to 
our programme of democratisation and transition to a market 
economy," the president said.

  [Text] It will not be long before Kyrgyzstan slips down to 
the level of African countries, presidential adviser for social 
and economic matters Talai Koichumanov told INTERFAX Wednesday 
[22 June]. 
  The country's three-year economic restructuring plan may 
prove unworkable unless Dushanbe gets credits from the IMF and 
donor countries, he said. 
  Koichumanov said Kyrgyz industry was in need of updating and 
some loss-making businesses should be liquidated. 
  He said the budget was being filled only to half its 
requirements and the bulk of expenditure sent to cover social 
needs. Taxation rather than industrial earnings is the main 
sources of government revenues, he said. 
  In his view, government resources are being channeled to 
meet 
social needs such as grain, energy and medical imports with 
money spent for "consumption rather than production." 
  Koichumanov said that nothing short of foreign credits and 
investment could help lead the country out of the crisis. For 
this to happen, he said, maximum incentives must be set to 
attract foreign investors, particularly leading transnational 
corporations.

  [Text] As many as 900 fighters of the Tajik opposition have 
accumulated on the Afghan territory on the border with 
Gorno-Badakhshan (Tajikistan's autonomous region), the press 
bureau of the Russian border forces reported to INTERFAX 
Wednesday [22 June]. According to the press bureau, the 
greatest number of fighters has been registered in the Afghan 
kishlaks (villages) of Andzhiz, Yapur, and Veski. 
  Since 18 June, Russia border guards prevented five attempts 
of the armed groups of the Tajik opposition to penetrate the 
border from the Afghan territory on the sections of the Pyanj, 
Moskovskiy, and Khorog frontier detachments. 
  According to available information, leaders of the Tajik 
opposition have ordered the fighters of the so called 
Kumsangirsko-Pyanj and Kulyab fronts to conduct a series of 
subversive acts against the frontier detachments of the Pyanj 
and Moskovskiy frontier detachments and against the civilian 
population living in Tajikistan's Khatlon Region. 
  Leaders of drug and mafia circles have made two attempts to 
block the military cantonment of the frontier detachment and one 
of the detachment's posts on the territory of Gorno-Badakhshan 
since 18 June. 
  According to the press bureau, the command and leadership of 
the Russian frontier forces in Tajikistan are undertaking all 
appropriate measures to guard and defend the border.

  [Text] Resignation of the officials of the Gorno-Badakhshan 
Autonomous Oblast of Tajikistan was demanded by the participants 
of a small illegal rally, which took place in Khorog, the 
administrative center of the oblast. 
  A correspondent of the ITAR-TASS news agency was told this 
by 
an independent and well-informed source of Gorno-Badakhshan. 
  The demonstrators, among whom were many women and old 
people, 
accused the local authorities of being unable to end legal 
tyranny and the growth of organized crime. 
  The demonstrators pointed out that the processes of 
surrendering weapons, which are illegally kept by the 
population, and the disbanding of illegal armed formations are 
extremely slow in Khorog as well as in other rayons of the 
autonomous oblast. [words indistinct] 
  Saydamir Zukhurov, minister of security, confirmed the 
report 
on illegal rally in Khorog. However, according to his words 
there were no demands of resignation of the oblast's leadership. 
The people wanted to learn from the officials of 
Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast when law and order finally 
would be established on the territory of the autonomous oblast 
and after receiving full and specific answers the demonstrators 
peacefully went away, stated Zukhurov, minister of security of 
Tajikistan.

  [Text] The President of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaymiyev has 
supported the decree of President Yeltsin on combating crime. 
  "Much of what the decree provides for has been done in 
Tatarstan since April 1993 and produced noticeable, if not 
striking results," Shaymiyev told Interfax. 
  He said that after he was given special powers by the Tatar 
parliament and after extraordinary steps were taken to stamp out 
crime, law enforcement workers have overcome "the syndrome of 
fearing the underworld" and now control the situation. 
  Shaymiyev said the rate of unsolved crimes has grown from 49 
to 72 pct of the total number of registered crimes. He 
accounted the growth in the overall rate to stronger control 
over attempts by law enforcement bodies to underestimate the 
scale of crime. 
  President Yeltsin was informed about the experience in 
detail 
and the experience was approved by the Russian Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin, the Tatar leader announced. 
  He admitted that certain excesses are possible in the 
process 
of enforcing the decree. Still "if we want to act adequately in 
the present situation, there is no other way today." 
  Shaymiyev thinks that the Council of the Federation and the 
State Duma must back the decree by appropriate laws and before 
that express their support.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Spiridonov, recently elected as head </F>
of the Komi Republic in May 1994, by unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given -- "Exclusive" report No. 25 of 75] 
  [Text] INTERFAX: What additional opportunities will you 
have due to the new powers that you have received? Experts 
believe that if the two republics within the composition of 
Russia (Karelia and Komi) refuse from the institution of 
presidency, this will restrict activities of their leaders. 
  SPIRIDONOV: Certainly, the head of the Komi Republic elected 
directly by the population will enjoy a kind of additional 
immunity in the face of both the federal structures and the 
representative bodies in Komi. However, I think that the new 
Constitution gives to the State Council (the future parliament) 
enough rights for control over the leader. 
  At the same time, the additional powers will inevitably lead 
to additional and rather serious responsibility for the leader. 
I will point out that the head of the republic and the 
president are not quite the same. 
  I have repeatedly stated that there must be only one 
president in Russia. I still think so since each of the 
federation's constituent members is an integral part of the 
Russian Federation. The leaders of the republics and regions, 
even if they are elected by nation-wide voting, cannot be called 
the presidents. 
  The president in most cases does not head either the 
legislative or the executive powers but seems to stand above 
both of them. Contrary to the president, the head of the 
republic will directly head the government which means that he 
has to bear more responsibility than many regional presidents. 
That is why I believe that as the Head of the Komi Republic I 
will have enough powers but just in order to work more than some 
presidents do. 
  INTERFAX: How will the head of the Komi republic organize 
"regional" and "federal" utilization of many resources possessed 
by the republic? 
  SPIRIDONOV: This is right. God really made us very rich 
with natural and mineral resources. These resources must be 
used. Given the economic crisis it would be a crime just to be 
standing on these resources without using them now. 
  First of all I will speak on the situation in the forestry 
complex -- the oldest industry in Komi which is now in a very 
poor situation. Success will depend on support which the center 
can give to the republic. This is the primary task. 
  The second point is that we must go back to our economic 
origins and organize a good mining industry in this region. We 
have all necessary opportunities since a significant part of the 
Urals reach with mineral resources belongs to Komi, a kind of 
mountain countries. 
  I believe that we have great opportunities for development 
of 
this industry. We just should not listen much to various 
demagogs covered by "green masks" who are pursuing their selfish 
political goals frightening people by ecological threats. 
Everything what the republic has must be made of use to people. 
  INTERFAX: The strike movement of miners is gaining force in 
the republic. There are certain suggestions that the Komi 
government and the parliament were hoping for the center too 
much in what concerned the settlement of this issue. Will you 
have more opportunities to influence the Russian government on 
this issue since now you have received new powers? 
  SPIRIDONOV: The point is that the coal industry is managed 
by the federal bodies. That is why this issue can be resolved 
only through contacts with the federal structures. 
  The Komi leadership is maintaining permanent contacts with 
the center. A resolution of the Russian government on the 
problems on the Pechor coal basin was worked out as a result. 
  The resolution provides for significant investments of 
capital into the industry. Unfortunately, some mines will be 
closed. However, I strongly believe that today it will better to 
create new jobs for specialists living in the North rather than 
to close unprofitable enterprises. 
  Today most of investments into the social sphere must go to 
the regions with normal climate. Otherwise, inhabitants of the 
North region will be practically condemned to dying. 
  A special protocol was signed with the Rosugol company. I 
have recently met the leadership of the Kaliningrad Region 
(western Russia) where the climate is rather favorable and 
construction of dwelling places will cost twice cheaper than in 
our northern Vorkuta. 
  When I have to meet with miners, I always tell them on their 
political demands, "You are used by various dishonest political 
leaders in order to get access to power. You are promised 
possible and impossible privileges when you are used." 
Recently, miners have been given so many privileges that 
sometimes they allow themselves not to work for a half of the 
year. 
  I think that miners, being naive, will be listening to those 
who enjoy using the difficulties of Vorkuta and Inta in their 
own interests and be backing them. In fact, there are many 
difficulties but there will be nothing good out of it. 
  INTERFAX: You have repeatedly stated that the federal treaty 
does not work. Obviously, that is why the bilateral treaty 
between the Komi Republic and the Russian Federation. 
  SPIRIDONOV: I believe that the treaty on establishment of 
the federation must be signed by its constituent members. 
During the last constitutional conference, in my opinion, 
called by the advisors of the president rather than by Boris 
Yeltsin himself, there were not more than 20 pct or 30 pct of 
the federation's constituent members present. 
  As a result, the Constitution was adopted, worked out by 
mostly irresponsible people from the public and political 
organizations, the trade unions, etc. The Constitution includes 
only a part of the provisions of the federal treaty. 
  Since Yeltsin remains practically the only person at the 
federal level who understands what the Russian state system is, 
he proposed to us that our bilateral relations be legalized. It 
is obvious that the present Federal Assembly cannot include the 
federal treaty in the Constitution. 
  Unfortunately, most of current politicians do not realize 
the 
particularities of the Russian federal state system. That is 
what makes the uniqueness of Russia.

<F P=106> [V. Kuchin report; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kamchatka mass media reported that the Far East 
Maritime Steamship Company had stopped allocating vessels for 
transporting containers to Kamchatka, and that Vladivostok had 
decided not to renew business relations with Kamchatka in the 
area of petroleum products delivery. Things have gone so far 
that Kamchatka cargoes are now being sold in the Maritime Kray 
to pay for debts incurred, without regard for who in Kamchatka 
owns it. This correspondent asked Kamchatka Oblast Governor 
Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov to comment on these reports. He 
said that as far as Kamchatka and probably other northern 
territories were concerned, such an imperious policy toward the 
outlying regions still dominated certain circles of the Maritime 
Kray. Vladivostok exploits its geographical location and its 
transportation links with the center of Russia, and it no longer 
considers the needs of these northern regions. This especially 
applies to the fuel and energy resources meant for Kamchatka. 
[passage omitted] However, it is only proper to note that talks 
with the Maritime Kray over the last few weeks give some hope 
that such events will not be repeated. 
  The Far East Maritime Steamship Company is reluctantly 
allocating ships for the Vladivostok-Petropavlovsk route, but as 
for passenger routes, no one even mentions them; it is as if 
they have never existed. [passage omitted] The Maritime Kray 
shipowners find it more profitable to work with Bangkok, Manila, 
Singapore, and Pusan than with Russia's northern ports. 
[passage omitted] 
  Vladimir Afanasyevich Biryukov added that the administration 
is continuing its talks with foreign partners on delivering 
petroleum products, some of which, sadly, are cheaper than 
Russian ones. [passage omitted] 
  As for marine transportation links, let me add that those 
Kamchatka residents who decided to leave the peninsula for good 
have become hostages. The number of these people increases 
daily; no matter who you ask, they want to leave Kamchatka. 
Delays in the payment of salaries, stoppages of enterprises, 
high prices, unemployment, a high crime rate, and unbearable 
climatic conditions augmented by freezing apartments and the 
lack of hot, and often even cold, water forces people to make 
such sad decisions. [passage omitted]

work of the rayon link and reducing the number of officials in 
these structures. The city's administrative division has 
changed: Three rayons -- Admiralteyskiy, Kurortnyy, and 
Tsentralnyy -- have been organized on the basis of seven rayons. 
  Work is under way on the formation of the concept of local 
self-management. For this a directive from the mayor has formed 
a working group consisting of workers from the city hall and 
rayon administrations and representatives of the public.

<F P=106> ["Eduard Shevardnadze: `There Is No Problem Between the </F>
Georgians and Abkhazians Which We Cannot Solve'" -- ITAR-TASS 
headline; by unidentified GIA-TASS correspondent] 
  [Text] Tbilisi, 22 Jun -- The process of achieving a 
peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia is, naturally, 
of great significance for Georgia but, at the same time, it is 
an important factor in stabilizing the situation in the northern 
Caucasus as well, Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze 
said at a news conference today. 
  As for the political status of Abkhazia, noted Shevardnadze, 
we can look at any proposal by the Abkhazian side within the 
framework of a united and indivisible Georgia. We are willing 
to grant Abkhazia the kind of status that would be in line with 
the highest world standards. 
  Commenting on the recent Georgian-Ossetian talks in 
Vladikavkaz, Shevardnadze gave a positive assessment of their 
results, which have made agreement possible on the issues of the 
reopening of transport links, the movement of people on the 
territory of the conflict zone, joint work to combat crime, etc. 
  Regarding conflicts in other regions of the Caucasus and the 
Karabakh problem in particular, the head of state said that the 
success of the peacekeeping mission in Abkhazia could well 
stimulate positive processes in Karabakh as well. 
  Analyzing the causes of the tragedies that have befallen 
Georgia in recent years, Shevardnadze said that they followed 
from the incorrect and erroneous policy toward Russia chosen by 
Georgia after the break-up of the USSR. He stressed that it was 
because of this policy that the country had become totally 
isolated, which had led, in particular, to the loss of Abkhazia.

  [Text] Tbilisi, June 22 (SNARK) -- Today Eduard 
Shevardnadze made the statement at the press conference which 
took place in the Georgia's parliament. 
  "Speaking on the reasons of the Abkhazia's tragedy we should 
take into consideration the general political context, the 
background of the tragic events taken place in Abkhazia", said 
the Head of the Georgian state. "The most important factor is 
the syndrome of some alienation and distrust between Russia and 
Georgia arisen in the period of the USSR's break-up and just 
after it has taken place. This confrontation during a long 
period of time wasn't overcome but, on the contrary, was 
strengthened". But the authorities of two states did their best 
to overcome this dangerous tendency and establish relations of 
good neighbors. The visit of Boris Yeltsin which took place in 
February 1994 became the decisive factor, according to the 
opinion expressed by Eduard Shevardnadze. 
  The basic point in the conflict's settlement is the 
effective 
cooperation which was established between Russia and Georgia, 
from the one hand, and the UNO [United Nations Organization], 
its General Secretary and the Security Council, the CSCE and the 
whole international community from the other. The cooperation 
will settle the military, technical, humanitarian and other 
problems connected with settlement of the conflict. 
  Answering the questions of journalists, Eduard Shevardnadze 
stated that the decisive word to the settlement of the conflict 
will be said by the Russian peace-keeping forces. Russia may be 
trusted in. The guarantee is the fact that "great political 
forces" are united round the conflict. The introduction of the 
peace-keeping troops into the zone of the conflict doesn't 
touch the political status of Abkhazia. The latter will be 
solved at the negotiations under the aegis of the UN with the 
intermediary role of Russia and "friends of Georgia" -- the 
Western states.

  [Text] Tbilisi, June 22 (SNARK) -- "If we manage to achieve 
a considerable progress in cause of Abkhazian conflict's 
settlement, a process of general stabilization in Caucasian 
region will begin", declared Eduard Shevardnadze in his 
interview to SNARK. 
  Answering the question on the ways of the Karabakh problem's 
settlement, the Head of Georgian State mentioned that the 
Abkhazian conflict's settlement will be a great spur for solving 
all the conflicts in Transcaucasia with the participation of 
Russia. 
  "The form of the Abkhazian conflict's settlement is unique 
and it will be a good example in searching the ways of solving 
the Karabakh conflict", said the Head of Georgian State.

  [Text] Gudauta June 23 TASS -- Russian mine-clearers have 
made two check points and four observation points in Gali 
(Abkhazia) safe for use. Gali has become the headquarters of 
the Russian peace- keeping troops in the western security zone. 
  The mine-clearing operations in Gali, along the Georgian- 
Abkhazian conflict line, was the result of the Russian 
peace-keeping mission's first day of work, ITAR-TASS was told on 
Thursday by Colonel Aleksandr Luchaninov, the Russian Defence 
Ministry's spokesman in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. 
  According to the colonel, a battalion of field engineers is 
using technical means and mine-seeking dogs to conduct the 
mine-clearing operations in the locality where the peace-keeping 
forces will be stationed. The Russian military need to hastily 
put up almost 40 block houses on an area of more than one 
thousand square kilometres. 
  Luchaninov reported that the Russian military are now 
preparing the text of an appeal to the population of Abkhazia. 
The peace- keepers will use the local mass media and distribute 
leaflets to explain the goals and purposes of the Russian 
peace-keeping mission. The most important conditions for the 
fulfillment of those goals, the spokesman said, are the 
surrender of arms by the population in the danger zone on the 
Inguri river, and the withdrawal of heavy weapons, armoured 
vehicles, and artillery to the positions agreed upon in the 
Georgian-Abkhazian agreement signed May 15 of this year. 
  Luchaninov said that the Russian military personnel were 
determined to put a halt to any illegal actions directed against 
the peace-keepers, and were ready to shoot to kill without 
warning.

  [Text] The Georgian head of state has issued a decree on 
certain aspects of carrying out the privatization of state 
property in the republic's regions. In accordance with the head 
of state's decree, commissions are to be established to conduct 
an in-depth study of individual cases of state property 
privatization and cases of uncontrolled privatization. Local 
branches of the relevant ministries and departments are to 
decide promptly on the inclusion of individual enterprises into 
the privatization lists and to present agreed proposals to the 
Ministry of State Property Management. Local bodies of 
authority are to use economic methods to assist in the process 
of managing the enterprises which have already been privitized 
and utilizing their industrial potential. In order to distribute 
vouchers among the population, the process of compiling the 
lists of the republic's citizens and their presentation to the 
Ministry of State Property Management should be speeded up. 
Apart from the Ministry of State Property Management, the heads 
of towns and rayons are to assume personal responsibility for

  [Text] A U.S. Defense Deparment delegation led by Brigadier 
General Baumann, the head of training for the 7th Army, is 
visiting Georgia. 
  [Correspondent] The visit was agreed upon last spring in the 
United States, when the visiting Georgian head of state met 
Defense Secretary William Perry. The Pentagon delegation has 
already met the leadership of the Georgian Defense Ministry. 
The delegation was briefed on the process of army construction 
in Georgia and the problems being encountered. 
  Today, the guests were received by Eduard Shevardnadze. He 
told them that the cooperation agreement signed last spring is 
already working and that this visit by military experts is a 
testimony to that. Today, when the Georgian Army is still in 
the early days of its development, learning from the Pentagon's 
experience would be a priceless opportunity for us. 
  Discussing Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative, which 
our republic was among the first in the CIS to join, Eduard 
Shevardnadze said that the introduction of peacekeeping forces 
to Abkhazia would signal the beginning of a new stage in 
settling the conflict there. 
  At the end of the meeting, Brig. Gen. Baumann said that the 
delegation came to Georgia on the instructions of Defense 
Secretary Perry. We arrived here to meet officials from the 
Georgian Ministries of Defense and Foreign Affairs and members 
of Parliament, said the general. We would like to discuss 
venues for cooperation and to determine our common interests. 
  Answering a question about his vision for cooperation, the 
general said: First of all, we should study issues relating to 
the training of the Georgian Army. It would be interesting to 
learn how Georgia intends to develop its Army. We would like to 
share with you our experience in this sphere. 
  The meeting was attended by Defense Minister Varden 
Nadibaidze; U.S. Ambassador Kent Brown; Petre Chkheidze, 
Georgian ambassador to the United States; and officials from the 
office of the head of state.

  [Text] Any mass return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia 
during the peacekeeping operation in the region will be 
unacceptable, the Abkhazian foreign ministry said in a statement 
on Wednesday. It said the measure would be enforced on a 
case-by-case basis in keeping with the program adopted by the 
four- party commission. 
  The commission, now into a second day of work at the Black 
Sea city of Sochi, involves representatives of Russia, Georgia, 
Abkhazia and the United Nations. The timing and procedure of 
repatriating the refugees and displaced persons dominates its 
agenda. 
  The ministry has spoken against any attempt to try to link 
the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in the region with the 
repatriation issue.

  [Text] On 13 June, at the headquarters of the 
Georgian Popular Front, three of the country's solid political 
organizations -- the Popular Front, "Charter-91," and the 
Republican Party -- signed an agreement on the creation of one 
political organization -- the United Republican Party of Georgia. 
  With the signing of this agreement an important process has 
begun: The amalgamation of political parties in Georgia, 
something that was unavoidable but has been long delayed in 
Georgia. In accordance with the agreement, until the 
constituent congress is convened, the party's provisional 
leading body is to be the Political Council (composed of 13 
members) that will be run by mutual agreement prior to the 
adoption of the party's rules. The Political Council is 
empowered to adopt a decision on any issue relating to the 
party's activities provided it has the support of more than half 
of the members. The work of the Political Council is to be 
presided over by three cochairmen, all of whom have equal 
rights: Nodar Natadze (Popular Front), Tedo Paatashvili 
("Charter- 91"), and Vakhtang Dzabiradze (Republican Party). 
The party will operate as one faction in the Republic of 
Georgia Parliament. 
  At the meeting, the cochairmen of the United Republican 
Party 
of Georgia signed the party's political declaration that 
stipulates the speediest resolution of the following problems 
during this fateful time for Georgia: 
  1. To restore the united national consciousness of the 
Georgian nation and reattach the nation's dismembered limbs. 
  2. To determine correctly Georgia's historical and 
state function in the Caucasian region at the border between 
Asia and Europe and elaborate a nation-state doctrine as the 
basis for the state's official strategic political course. 
  3. To restore Georgia's territorial integrity and 
extend the Georgian state's jurisdiction throughout its entire 
territory. 
  4. To restore and elaborate in reality the sovereignty 
of the Georgian state and steadfastly defend the trend toward 
its growth and consolidation. 
  5. To transform real and not imaginary parliamentary 
government into the primary guarantee of the country's 
democratic development. 
  6. To conduct without delay structural and legislative 
reform pertaining to the political and economic management of 
the state. 
  7. The state is to ensure that the minimum social 
needs of citizens are satisfied in a just manner and their 
lives, dignity, and rights are legally protected. 
  In the near future, the United Republican Party of Georgia 
plans to present a concrete program covering all the 
aforementioned problems to Parliament and society. The party 
believes that Georgia has the spiritual, cultural and 
historical, intellectual, political, and natural or human 
potential to enable the country to avoid a complete nation-state 
catastrophe. At the same time, the party views the use of force 
to resolve problems as the most serious crime against the 
country's integrity. 
  Those present at the meeting observed a minute's silence in 
memory of those Georgian guardsmen who were slaughtered in Gori 
on 13 June 1992. 
  The crowded meeting ended with a dinner.

  [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin has 
asked Sergey Kovalev, the human rights representative who was 
appointed to that post by the State Duma, to observe the 
implementation of the decree "On urgent measures to protect the 
population from gang violence and other manifestations of 
organized crime", including the examination of complaints from 
citizens. "I hope that you sympathize with the considerations 
which forced me to sign the decree. At the same time, I share 
the apprehensions of the public, the deputies, and your own 
fears that during implementation of the decree threats to 
constitutional human rights could arise," reads a letter by the 
president of the Russian Federation, the text of which was 
circulated by his press service. 
  "I believe that until the relevant federal constitutional 
law 
has been adopted, the representative for human rights should 
proceed in his activity on the basis of the principle of Article 
15 of the Russian Constitution, according to which the 
constitution has direct force and is applicable throughout the 
territory of the Russian Federation," the document notes. "In 
your work you can rely on the assistance of the heads of 
constituent parts of the Federation and of the president's 
authorized representatives." 
  Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent that within the next few days Boris Yeltsin will 
submit to the State Duma a bill on introducing additions and 
alterations to the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedural 
Code of the Russian Federation in order to bring the decree on 
combatting gang violence into line with Russian legislation. He 
is participating in today's meeting of the lower house of 
parliament together with Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Russian 
president's authorized representative at the Federal Assembly. 
Deputies are expected to again express their views on the 
decree which has met with a mixed reaction among politicians. 
  Having told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "Boris Yeltsin 
does not intend to suspend this decree," Sergey Filatov, head of 
the president's administration, added that "if violations of 
human rights are observed in the course of its implementation, 
adjustments may be made to the document. It is not a dogma."

<F P=106> [Article by Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, State Duma deputy, under </F>
the "In the Country" rubric: "Perestroyka Goes On"] 
  [Text] We have been told: Russia is entering a phase of 
relative stability. There are no tumultuous political 
conflicts, nor is there a standoff between authorities, and a 
treaty on social accord has been signed. But before rejoicing 
at the "stabilization," it would be wise to think: What is 
actually being stabilized? And by what methods? 
  Let us look carefully: The key elements of the old, Soviet 
system of socioeconomic life still exist and operate. 
Monopolies and the former structure of production are still in 
place. Real private property and a competitive environment are 
lacking. No land reform has been carried out. No democratic 
procedures of public control over authorities have been worked 
out, nor has a local self- government system been formed, there 
is no real division of powers.... The stabilization of such a 
system is not an asset. It means that Russia will remain an 
oligarchic and supermonopolized state, only with a new 
"political superstructure": without the CPSU, but with a 
distinct criminal tinge. 
  This system cannot be run by normal, democratic methods. 
Under Soviet power, the most effective means of government were 
Politburo decisions. Passed by a narrow circle of people 
without any discussion in society, without consideration for 
democratic "convention," they were subject to unquestioning 
implementation. Unfortunately, it is precisely those decisions 
that the recent presidential edicts are closely reminiscent of. 
  In his economic edicts, the president is encroaching on the 
State Duma's jurisdiction, demonstrating that it is incapable of 
creating economic legislation on time and that the government is 
unable to run the economy in a correct and prompt fashion. 
However, government by decree will hardly succeed, either. 
When a law is being created, a mechanism for its enforcement 
must be worked out simultaneously. Here we do not have any 
mechanism at all. The "infrastructure" for the edicts will be 
added by the government, and it is anyone's guess how much the 
ideas they contain may be distorted. Moreover, the edicts, 
while often expressing correct economic ideas -- which are not 
new, as a matter of fact -- nonetheless inevitably suffer from 
being unfinished, incomplete, not comprehensive. Some of them 
are really populist in nature. Naturally, cutting taxes is okay, 
but so far it is only an instruction to the government (to all 
appearances, only for the next year). Undoubtedly, quotas and 
licenses should be lifted, to say nothing of benefits. But whom 
will the president rely on in solving this problem? 
  Entirely justified fears have been expressed that various 
political forces may use the edicts as a pretext to crank up 
tension, hunt for enemies, and indulge in political intrigues. 
But this is not the main danger; the danger is that there is a 
clear emphasis on antidemocratic, illegitimate, and even 
unconstitutional methods of government. The departure from 
earlier stated principles has culminated in the edict "On Urgent 
Measures To Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other 
Forms of Organized Crime." It violates everything that can be 
violated: human rights, a number of federal laws, even the 
Constitution. 
  Of course, at a time when the people are totally intimidated 
by rampant crime it is easy to evoke positive emotions by 
promising tight measures. But everyone must realize: Tomorrow, 
if not today, he himself may become a victim of legalized 
lawlessness. Yes, lawlessness, because there is no other name 
for a situation where it is laid down that crime is to be fought 
by unconstitutional and unlawful methods. A perfect opportunity 
for settling scores with rivals and for staging inter-group 
political showdowns.... It is entirely unclear what will now 
happen to our courts. How will judges act when they have, side 
by side before them, the edict and the laws and the Constitution 
it violates? 
  However, this scenario was predetermined by the very method 
of preparing and adopting the Constitution. Was it not clear 
even at the time that we were in for a struggle against crime? 
If the Constitution had been discussed in society in a normal 
fashion, if the professionals had been given a say, would they 
not have warned that in our conditions 48-hour pre-trial 
detention is absurd? Then it would not have been necessary to 
"correct" the 48 hours to 30 days by edict. 
  Before the very eyes of the entire country the very 
"letter," not only the much-invoked "spirit of the law" is being 
violated. Moreover, it is being violated by the sole guarantor 
of the Constitution -- the president. So does the established 
"system" whose stabilization some are ready to welcome allow 
itself to be run in this way? It is becoming clear that we did 
not have profound reform, what we experienced was nothing but 
perestroyka. 
  "How can it be that we did not have reform?" advocates of 
the 
course will retort. "The market is filled with goods; true, 
they are very expensive, and more often than not they are not 
for all...." But nor were they meant for all formerly, and more 
often than not those for whom they were meant were the same 
people. "But formerly we did not have any democracy at all...." 
But it is manifestly clear especially in the light of the 
recent edict that we do not have it now, either. 
  So, what's up "in the country" nowadays? For most people it 
is more of the same.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Sergey Romazin, chief of the </F>
Russian Federation Ministry of Justice Administration for 
Elaboration of Legislation on Judicial Reform and Struggle 
Against Lawbreaking; place and date not given: "Inevitable, 
Rather than Harsh Punishment. New Draft Criminal Code Reflects 
New Crime Situation"] 
  [Text] Russian citizens have always found it hard to 
comprehend the winged phrase uttered by the literary hero that 
the Criminal Code ought to be respected. Even more so in these 
new times of troubles, when everything at home is topsy-turvy. 
And especially since the archaic nature, ideologization, and 
conservatism of the criminal legislation currently in force are 
obvious to everyone. The attempt to produce a new Criminal Code 
(two years ago) was successfully thwarted. A fresh attempt is 
being made now. A working group comprising specialists from the 
Ministry of Justice and the State Legal Administration and 
eminent legal scientists has completed its work on the general 
section of Russia's new Criminal Code. 
  Working group member Sergey Romazin, chief of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Justice Administration for Elaboration of 
Legislation on Judicial Reform and Struggle Against Lawbreaking, 
answers ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's questions. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] Sergey Borisovich! You must agree that 
the reality in our country is harsh. Explosions echo in the 
streets, contract killers operate, all and sundry talk about 
mafia and corruption. The president's latest edict "On Urgent 
Measures..." is a kind of line drawn beneath a far from 
brilliant state of affairs. Will the new Criminal Code provide 
a kind of panacea against criminal misfortunes? 
  [Romazin] It is necessary to make this clear straightaway: 
The general section of the new Criminal Code is the part which 
formulates the general principles of criminal policy, offers 
material definition of crimes, categorizes crimes, explains 
terms like "recidivism" and "organized forms of crime," and 
elucidates questions concerning the system and categories of 
punishment, criminal records, and others. The special section 
of the Criminal Code -- which is not yet ready -- will cover 
specific crimes and the punishment for them. 
  Now let us turn to explosions and panaceas. One of the tasks 
facing the working group was to bring criminal legislation in 
line with the criminological realities of today. Of course, 
these questions will be largely resolved when drafting the 
Criminal Code's special section. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] What is and what is not deemed a crime? 
  [Romazin] The definition of "crime" is fairly brief: "Any 
act (whether of commission or omission), prohibited by criminal 
law and causing damage or threatening to cause damage to an 
individual, society, or the state, is deemed a crime." Let me 
draw attention to the fact that this definition already reflects 
the contemporary hierarchy of values protected by the state from 
criminal infringements: the individual, society, and the state. 
This sequence will also provide the foundations on which the 
system of the new Criminal Code's special section will be built. 
The following also stems from this definition: People cannot 
be punished for acts which are rejected by society on moral or 
ethical grounds but are not specified in the criminal law. The 
Ancient Roman jurists used to say: "There is neither crime nor 
punishment unless so provided by the law." 
  Substantial amendments have been introduced in the Criminal 
Code's general section on punishment. Censure, the imposition 
of an obligation to make restitution for any damage caused, and 
corrective labor have been excluded from the list of 
punishments. The latter category of punishment is purely Soviet 
because, until quite recently, we had the socialist idea of 
"re-education through labor." You have to agree that this is an 
anachronism in the market era. 
  The Criminal Code retains forms of punishment like fines, 
deprivation of the right to hold certain office or engage in 
certain activity, deprivation of military or special ranks, 
confiscation of property, and imprisonment. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] How about the death penalty? 
  [Romazin] The draft's authors failed to reach unanimity on 
this question. Under the Constitution, the imposition of the 
death penalty is restricted only to cases involving the 
commission of especially grave crimes against life. By way of 
an alternative, it was proposed to altogether abolish the death 
penalty as a form of punishment and introduce life imprisonment. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] When talking about organized crime, the 
law and order organs blame the lack of a legislative base for 
the struggle against it. Does the draft Criminal Code fill 
these loopholes? 
  [Romazin] Having worked for more than 30 years in the 
courts, let me say that all references to the lack of a law in 
the struggle against organized crime are more myth than reality. 
Even the Criminal Code currently in force makes it possible to 
institute proceedings not only against "underlings" but also 
against the top mafia bosses. As a matter of fact, this should 
be the topic of a separate conversation. But as regards the 
draft, let me say this: Staffers of law enforcement organs will 
be given a clear definition of what constitutes a group of 
persons conspiring to commit a crime, and the very term of an 
organized criminal fraternity group will be explained. The 
struggle against this type of crime will probably be helped by 
the formulation that all persons participating in a group crime 
are equally liable regardless of the function they may have 
performed, according to previous agreement, during the 
commission of the crime. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] In other words, henceforth anyone 
hiring a killer will be held liable for premeditated murder. 
  [Romazin] Exactly. Moreover, participation in any form of 
group criminal activity will always attract harsher punishment. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] It is well known that criminality is 
now "getting younger." Has this trend been taken into account 
by the draft's authors? 
  [Romazin] Most certainly. Taking into account the results 
of age psychology studies and criminological indicators, a 
standard age of criminal responsibility is brought in at 14 
years. At the same time, if a 14-years old adolescent accused 
of having committed a crime is psychologically retarded, he will 
be deemed not liable to criminal proceedings. 
  For the first time, it is proposed to introduce in our 
legislation a norm imparting legal significance to the fact that 
a crime has been committed by someone aged between 18 and 20 
years. What does this mean? In exceptional cases, taking into 
account the nature of the committed crime and the specific 
features of the accused's personality, the court may apply 
measures of punishment provided for minors against persons who 
are 18, 19, or 20 years old. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] The press and academic literature have 
expressed the opinion that it would not be a bad thing to 
introduce criminal liability for legal persons. 
  [Romazin] At present only physical persons can be held 
criminally liable, in other words citizens who have reached a 
certain age, are mentally healthy, and so on. At the same time, 
there are frequent situations when criminal liability for any 
damage caused to the environment or the health of millions of 
citizens as a result of harmful discharges by industrial 
enterprises attaches to some "fall guy" (as a rule the shop 
foreman, shift or section chief, and so on who has been forced 
to implement an unlawful decision made by the legal person's 
collegial organ -- board of directors, shareholders' meeting, 
and others -- under fear of punishment, dismissal from work, and 
so on). This is, to use the legal language, an objective 
imputation. Consequently, a person is sentenced but the crime 
goes unpunished. 
  Our authors' collective sees just one way out of this legal 
arbitrariness: In the event of any act specified by the 
criminal law, the actual legal person itself will be subject to 
criminal -- and I emphasize: criminal, not any other -- 
liability. 
  A few words at this point about punitive measures. The 
draft makes provisions for fines, prohibition to engage in 
certain activity, confiscation of property, and winding up of 
legal persons. Let us hope that the fear of criminal punishment 
will force our firms, joint-stock companies, enterprises, and 
other organizations to adopt a more respectful attitude toward 
the law and bring their corporate interests in line with the 
interests of individuals, society, and the state. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] So, work on the Criminal Code's first 
section is completed. What happens next? 
  [Romazin] The draft, whose discussion is not yet complete, 
will be submitted to the president for onward submission to the 
State Duma once all remarks and proposals have been summed up. 
I assume that this will happen this year. There is no room for 
any further delay -- I think that everyone realizes this. 
Especially today, when State Duma deputies, numerous jurists, 
and the mass media are perfectly justified in sounding the alarm 
about divergences between the edict "On Urgent Measures..." and 
the Constitution. 
  [ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA] One last question. Quite often 
staffers of law and order organs advocate making the Criminal 
Code harsher. What is your opinion? 
  [Romazin] Any professional would confirm that the main point 
in the struggle against crime is not the harshness of punishment 
but its inevitability. According to militia statistics, more 
than 2.5 million crimes are committed each year but only 
something like 800,000 criminals actually stand trial. Anyone 
can draw his own conclusions. Nonetheless, I would not say that 
the draft is all that liberal. Any persistent criminal, 
murderer, rapist, and anyone who crudely tramples the law is 
"entitled" to expect harsh punitive measures and look at the 
draft Criminal Code as quite tough. 
  At the same time, persons who have committed nonviolent 
crimes, who have repented for doing so, and who have made 
restitution for any damage caused, can hope for lenience by the 
law. Thus, it would be more appropriate to talk not about 
harshness but about the principle of differentiated criminal 
liability, which is consistently implemented in the draft new 
Criminal Code.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Our television agency received interesting 
information today from the public relations center of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, which we give almost in full. 
  On 21 June, operatives from the Moscow city directorate of 
internal affairs--with the support of 20,000 men of the

  [Text] "The idea of possibly prolonging parliament's and 
the president's authorities voiced by Federation Council Speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko is not new," Russian president's aide Georgiy 
Satarov declared in his interview with INTERFAX. He underlined 
that a month ago during a meeting between the president and the 
Liberal Democratic Union of December 12 deputy group of the 
State Duma, Deputy Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his 
attitude towards possible prolonging of the parliament's term in 
office. 
  In Satarov's words, Yeltsin answered that he does not oppose 
this "in the case that the State Duma and Federation Council 
work efficiently." 
  Satarov also underlined that "this idea was discussed in 
professional circles long ago." 
  When asked by Khakamada what is Yeltsin's attitude towards 
prolongation of his term in office, the latter said: "Do not 
touch upon the 1996 elections." 
  At the same time Satarov indicated that he would not 
interpret these words, he is just repeating them. 
  As Satarov said, if the idea of extension of the terms in 
office prevails then the appropriate change to the acting 
Constitution will have to be adopted by a referendum. However, 
the issue on a referendum is still open until the State Duma and 
Federation Council adopts a decree on referendums.

  [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- Russian presidential 
spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov described as "interesting, but 
debatable" Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko's 
proposal to postpone parliamentary elections. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Kostikov said 
that "the extension of the deputies' mandates and, evidently for 
maintaining the political balance, the postponement of 
presidential elections would allow (us) to continue constructive 
interaction between the branches of power established after the 
signing of the agreement on civic accord." 
  He believes that the future parliamentary elections can 
"make 
the country bristle up again, whip up tensions and add to the 
existing contradictions. This would play into the hands of only 
extremists and impatient politicians." 
  "Russia is tired of the acute political fever. More than 
anything else it now needs to preserve peace and conditions for 
growing the fragile sprouts of civic peace and accord," Kostikov 
said. 
  "There is one more aspect to it. We all see how difficult 
the process of maturing and strengthening political culture in 
Russia is. It will take more than one or two years to complete 
it. But at the same time we see that seriously thinking 
deputies and faction members are exerting considerable efforts 
in order to fight the inertia of confrontation. We see the 
gradual normalisation of cooperation between the president and 
the constructive factions of the State Duma and the Federation 
Council," he said. 
  Kostikov believes that the postponement of parliamentary 
elections could "allow the deputies not only to gain political 
experience, but, more importantly, to use it for Russia's 
benefit." 
  Asked about Yeltsin's possible reaction to Shumeyko's 
proposal, Kostikov replied that the president is unlikely to 
announce his position on the issue in the near future. "He 
values the sprouts of civic accord too much to endanger them," 
he added. 
  "This is a complicated, delicate and, I would say, 
constitutionally contradictory issue. The most reasonable thing 
we could do is to subject this dilemma to thorough and 
comprehensive examination and discussion in parties, factions, 
society and the press. But most importantly, to find out the 
public mood," Kostikov said. 
  "In this situation we must act only on the basis of public 
consensus and accord. Otherwise, the most interesting and 
constructive idea can prove the opposite," Kostikov said.

  [Text] The All-Russia Public Opinion Center held an opinion 
poll among 1594 respondents on the eve of June 22 which marks 
the 53rd anniversary of fascist Germany's attack on the Soviet 
Union. Forty-seven percent of Russian citizens believe that the 
rise of fascism is quite possible in Russia, while 35 percent 
have the opposite opinion. Eighteen percent of the respondents 
were undecided. 
  Seventy-five percent of those polled said that fascist 
organizations must be banned and 8 percent that such 
organizations have the right to exist. Five percent of the 
respondents think there are no and will be no such organizations 
in this country. Seven percent of the respondents were undecided 
and 5 percent said that this problem did not interest them. 
  Eighty-one percent of those poled believe that June 22 must 
be declared a day of national mourning and memory for the 
victims of the War. Seven percent were against this idea. 
Seven percent were undecided and 5 percent were not interested 
in the problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Zolotov under the "Such News: TRUD and News </F>
Agency Correspondents Report" rubric: "`Immigrants' Run Wild"] 
  [Text] Russia is becoming a center of illegal immigration. 
According to information at the disposal of the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], various international criminal organizations 
are using our country's territory to get their people into other 
states. This was reported yesterday at a news conference in the 
Russian Federation MVD. 
  Militia Lieutenant General Vladimir Kolesnikov, Russia's 
chief detective, said that Moscow is becoming a main center 
where such "refugees" gather from all over the world. Illegal 
immigrants come to us mainly from Vietnam, Taiwan, and China. 
Moreover they do not turn to the Russian authorities for 
assistance but register directly with the UN mission in Moscow 
-- after which it is very difficult to expel them from Russia. 
  For information: Whereas 530 crimes committed by foreign 
citizens were recorded in 1992, more than 15,000 were recorded 
in 1993.

Will Be Submitted to President Friday"] 
  [Text] A draft state program of post-check [voucher] 
privatization setting out the rules for denationalization of 
state property after 1 July will probably be up for President 
Boris Yeltsin's signature Friday. This has been disclosed by 
Dmitriy Vasilyev, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation 
State Committee for the Management of State Property. According 
to him, an edict setting the state program in motion is supposed 
to be signed by Boris Yeltsin early next week. Russian 
Federation Vice Premier Anatoliy Chubays stated earlier that 
some 20 percent of state property is supposed to be privatized 
for money in the post-check period. By July 1994 70 percent of 
Russia's property will be in the private sector; 10 percent of 
state enterprises are not subject to privatization.

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F>
Week" rubric: "Russia Rocked By Criminal Terror. The 
President's Edict Alone Is Insufficient To Combat It"] 
  [Text] "And outside the window yesterday they shot...." 
When a well-known humorist utters this phrase from the stage, 
the audience remains completely unmoved. Because nowadays there 
is no satirical exaggeration in this text. Street shootings are 
an everyday feature of all large Russian cities. People get 
shot outside your window and mine. And on your way to the store 
for a carton of milk you have to be prepared to find yourself in 
the line of fire or to be hit by shrapnel from yet another 
exploding Mercedes. Criminal terror has literally rocked the 
country. The only people who can be envied in such a situation 
are our future homegrown Hammets and Coppolas. If the mafia 
rampage in America in the 1930's gave writers and directors 
material for half a century of "gangster sagas," our mafiosi, 
who have long surpassed their Chicago counterparts, have set up 
writers and cinematographers for several hundred years to come. 
  Russian gangsters can feel justified pride. They have become 
a source of increased concern not only in Europe but across the 
Atlantic too. Special hearings on organized crime in Russia 
addressed by CIA and FBI leaders have been held in the U.S. 
Congress. So it is meaningless simply to say that the federal 
program for combating crime, supplemented the other day by a 
corresponding presidential edict, meets the country's vital 
needs. Let us be frank: Organized crime today threatens not 
only each and every one of us as individual citizens. It 
threatens the very fabric of the Russian state. Society 
therefore requires decisive action from the authorities. 
  Yet, as soon as it was made public, the president's edict 
was 
subjected to fierce and -- at least partly -- justified 
criticism from legislators, the press, and experts. It is 
perfectly clear why. The edict effectively invests the 
law-enforcent organs with extraordinary powers which cut right 
across existing legislation. Like many documents in the past, it 
is written with a view to ideal executors, people with "clean 
hands and warm hearts." 
  However, just as any piece of equipment should incorporate a 
fail-safe mechanism against idiots, so in composing edicts we 
need, alas, to proceed on the basis of human frailty. I 
certainly have no wish to cast sweeping aspersions on all those 
confronting the gangsters in unbelievably difficult conditions. 
But among law-enforcement officers, as among representatives of 
any other speciality, there are self-seeking and dishonorable 
people inclined to break the law. Recent major scandals 
demonstrate this. And the fact is that that the edict opens up 
an opportunity for such people to do what they like. Even as 
ordinary citizens without offices or bank accounts, we can 
hardly expect to remain unaffected by this. After all, just 
through a chance conjunction of circumstances you could find 
yourself in the way of some big shot or minor chief who has the 
right to hold you in detention for 30 days without filing 
charges.... 
  Moreover, you cannot help remembering the sad results of the 
numerous programs and edicts on combating crime which have 
"surfaced" in the past few years. Everything has somehow or 
other culminated either in nothing at all, or in the notorious 
"suitcases" that some politicians at the helm of the battle with 
the mafia have used to collect compromising material on others. 
  But, for all the justice of the complaints that have been 
made, there is another side to the coin. An extraordinary 
situation (and that is precisely what it is) requires 
extraordinary measures. Moreover, it is patently obvious that 
the people attacking the president's edict are precisely those 
who are in one way or another are responsible for the existing 
state of affairs. I mean the legislators, the majority of whom 
actually got into the Duma on platforms of ruthlessly combating 
crime. But where are the new codes to meet the prevailing 
situation? Our legislative snail, it seems, is not even 
crawling along. The president's edict, on the other hand, 
whether it is good or bad, is effectively the authorities' only 
real action in this sphere. It is not enough to criticize this 
edict and the executive: If you do not like the government's 
program, you should propose your own program of measures, and 
quickly. It is actually a good thing that the president's edict 
has provoked a reaction, albeit negative; at least it has pushed 
the appropriate Duma committees to draw up such a program. 
  Finally, perhaps the most important thing is what the 
critics 
of this document have overlooked. They are not examining it in 
the context of the president's package of economic edicts. Yet 
it is perfectly obvious that our crime wave -- just like any 
other crime wave, moreover -- was nurtured on the nourishing 
broth of economic chaos. On the other hand, as one U.S. expert 
noted, a "historically unprecedented clearance sale" is under 
way. The property of a vast country is changing owners. This 
is happening simultaneously with the extremely confused process 
of privatization itself. At the same time, there is an almost 
total absence of legislation in the sphere of business, which 
allows the hopeless debtor to thrive. All this drives our 
businessmen, who in another situation would be extremely 
law-abiding, into the arms of the mobsters. If there are no 
laws, or they do not operate, gangsters altruistically (oh, how 
altruistically) take upon themselves the role of arbiters in 
business disputes, and indeed the role of judicial executioners 
as well. 
  On the other hand, crime rises like yeast in conditions 
whereby the population is impoverished and the gap between rich 
and poor is growing. As far as I understand it, the president's 
latest edicts, in addition to their main goal of giving impetus 
to reforms, objectively create an obstacle in the way of the 
criminalization of the economy. After all, it was not the 
all-powerful FBI Director Hoover who defeated the mafia in the 
United States. That was achieved by Roosevelt's reforms, which 
rescued the U.S. economy from crisis. 
  If we now managed to create a system of social protection 
that was in any way effective, it would deprive the mafia of a 
stream of new recruits. The introduction of elementary order in 
the finance and taxation spheres, in relations between the state 
and the enterprises that supposedly belong to it, and in the 
sphere of export licensing and banking activity should sharply 
narrow the field of activity for organized crime. It is here, 
in purging economic relationships of crime, that the highroad in 
the struggle against crime lies. Certainly not in stepping up 
repressive measures. What is needed at the moment is some major 
impetus, some kind of tough shake-up. So as to transform the 
situation regarding crime in action and not just in words. We 
would very much like to see the president's edict provide just 
such an impetus. Meanwhile it is not only journalists and 
parliamentarians who have reacted to it. Those whom it directly 
affects -- the gangsters -- have also responded. A series of 
explosions has once again rocked the capital. These people 
still feel themselves masters of the situation. The authorities 
must make haste to prevent that feeling from becoming a 
reality....

  [Text] In 1993, the number of unemployed, registered by the 
Russian employment agencies increased 1.5 times compared to 
1992, reaching 7.8 million by the beginning of 1994, which 
accounts for 10.4 percent of the able-bodied population, says 
the Russian Central Bank's report to parliament. 
  The report also says that the growth rate of unemployment 
was 
"inadequate to the scope of economic recession." In 1993, the 
rate of industrial decline stood at 16.2 percent (compared to 18 
percent in 1002), says the Central Bank's report. 
  This document also says that the rate of the decline in the 
fuel industry has grown two times, reaching 15 percent (compared 
to 7 percent in 1992). 
  Agriculture was the most stable of the basic production 
branches. In 1993, the volume of its gross produce went down by 
only 4 percent. 
  The Central Bank's specialists believe that a fall in the 
efficiency of production was due to the retention of excessive 
workforce against the backdrop of massive stoppages. As a 
result, wages increases and rising prices on raw materials 
became the main factors accelerating inflation. 
  Unemployment is the worst in the Ingush Republic, and in the 
Ivanovo, Pskov, Yaroslavl and Volga-Vyatka regions. The 
Volga-Vyatka Region accounts for more than 10 percent of 
Russia's unemployed, and for just about 4 percent of the 
vacancies. 
  According to the report, unemployment has increased even 
further. In the first quarter of 1994, the number of unemployed 
was three time greater than the number of vacancies.

  [Text] Those Russian oil refineries that have concluded 
contracts with foreign firms to reactivate abandoned oil wells 
will have to pay for their services at the expense of their 
export revenue under main quotas. 
  A reliable expert at a Russian oil company told the Oil 
Information Agency the decision was made at one of the recent 
conferences of the leaders of the Fuel and Energy Ministry 
(Mintopenergo). 
  Mintopenergo argues that it has "no chance of giving those 
enterprises breaks or additional export quotas to pay for the 
services of foreign firms." The ministry has obliged the 
managers of oil enterprises to take measures to reduce oil well 
repair costs. At the same time such oil companies such as 
LUKoil, YUKOS and Rosneft have been asked to present their 
proposals for government support for oil and gas producers in 
paying their debts to foreign firms conducting oil and gas well 
repairs. 
  So far 25 foreign companies have carried out major repairs 
and maintenance under 46 contracts on more than 3,300 wells, 
which have produced an additional 15 million tonnes of crude. 
To pay the foreign firms for the work done Russian oil 
producers exported 3.3 million tonnes of crude under additional 
quotas in 1993. This year three million tonnes will be exported 
for the same purpose under the main quotas.

  [Text] In 1993, Russia repaid about $3.6 billion to its 
foreign creditors, and received $1.5 billion from its debtors, 
according to the Central Bank's report for 1993, submitted to 
the State Duma. 
  As of January 1, 1993, Russia owed foreign creditors $74.6 
billion. The spending on servicing the foreign debt in 
accordance with the schedule, coordinated with the 
creditor-countries, amounts to $40.7 billion, which is three 
times greater than the current credit balance. Out of this sum 
$17 billion (including interest) should have been repaid in 
1993; $9.7 billion is the deferred 1993 payments and $14 billion 
-- overdue payments. In real terms, Russia could repay only 
$2.5 billion in 1993. 
  The report also says that in 1993 Russia succeeded to 
persuade the Paris Club to transform part of its foreign debt. 
It reached the agreements on deferring the repayment of DM 
[deutschmarks] 8.5 billion to Germany, $1 billion to the U.S. 
and FRF [French francs] 1 billion to France. Depending on the 
type of the credit, the deferment will range from seven to ten 
years, plus a period of grace of two to five years. 
  In 1993, import tariffs of about 2.5 trillion rubles were 
transferred to the federal budget instead of the estimated 4.5 
trillion rubles, while revenues, gained from centralized 
exports, slightly exceeded 6 billion rubles. The report says 
that in 1993 the hard-currency balance in the Russian banks 
increased by 25 percent, while Russian residents' assets in 
foreign banks increased 2.8 times and amounted to $25 billion by 
the end of the year.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (BUSINESS-TASS) -- Russian Central 
Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko believes that one should not 
expect an upsurge in inflation in Russia during the second 
quarter of this year. 
  A rough analysis of the economic situation, he said today, 
shows that the government guidelines on money supply for the 
second quarter will be observed. According to available 
information, over the first four months of this year, the 
average monthly growth rate of the money supply was 10 percent 
while growth in cash supply was 13 percent, which is within the 
established targets. 
  Viktor Gerashchenko was giving a report on the results of 
the 
Russian Bank in 1993 and current tasks at a conference with 
heads of the main territorial directorates (national banks). 
The main aim of the conference, in which representatives of the 
State Duma and of the staffs of the president and government of 
the Russian Federation are also taking part, is to discover the 
main problems in the work of the Central Bank system and to 
define solutions to them.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "On Land, in the Air, and at </F>
Sea the Supreme Commander in Chief Tests the Nuclear Forces"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday President Boris Yeltsin supervised 
full command headquarters exercises on command and control of 
the Strategic Nuclear Forces, which were conducted by the 
Russian Defense Ministry on 21-22 June. 
  The supreme commander in chief's visit to the building in 
Arbatskaya Square and the General Staff Central Command and his 
presence at the very intensive training session for alert-duty 
personnel, working with headquarters and main commissariats of 
the Strategic Missile Forces, Navy, and Air Force scattered all 
over Moscow and Moscow Oblast and their military units in the 
North and in Siberia, ended with dummy launches of three 
strategic missiles. His visit to the military was the first 
occasion in the history of our state when the leader of the 
country has personally seen how and in what actual situation the 
decision to use nuclear missiles might be formulated. 
  Command headquarters exercises on strategic nuclear forces 
command and control are traditional in all countries possessing 
these weapons. They are conducted at least two or three times a 
year. At the end of May, for example, a strategic offensive 
forces training session took place in the United States and a 
Minuteman-3 ICBM was launched. 
  The Russian president's presence at the routine command 
headquarters exercises of the Strategic Nuclear Forces has 
nothing to do with saber-rattling or with demomstrating nuclear 
might on the eve of the meeting of the heads of the eight 
leading world states on the island of Corfu and in Naples, your 
IZVESTIYA correspondent was told at the Defense Ministry. It is 
merely connected with the new political, military, and 
military-technical situation following the signing of Russia's 
agreement with the United States and Britain on not aiming 
ballistic missiles at one another. 
  On 30 May we stated that our strategic missiles are on 
"zero" 
elevation. So Boris Yeltsin has to know how the leaders of the 
strategic nuclear triad would act in a hypothetical dangerous 
period and how quickly and accurately they would be able to aim 
Russian ballistic and cruise missiles in the required direction. 
  Journalists notified of these exercises by ITAR-TASS and 
INTERFAX reports waited to greet the president outside the 
General Staff building, but he did not come out to address 
representatives of the press. But the exercises passed off, 
according to my information, without any hitches. 
  According to confidential information in my possession, 
several divisions of the Strategic Missile Forces' RS-12M 
"Topol" mobile ground system participated in the exercises. 
Some of them carried out maneuvers in the forest near 
Novosibirsk, and one, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel 
Sergey Sergeyev, went to a prearranged spot in the Plesetskiy 
test range in Arkhangelsk Oblast and launched a missile in the 
direction of the Kura test site in Kamchatka. The division 
fired from a regular launcher a missile that had been placed on 
alert duty back in December...1984. 
  So we were able to check the reliability and technical 
readiness of these missiles for combat operation, I was told at 
the Strategic Missile Forces Main Staff, and, at the same time, 
to train officers, who now have a rare opportunity during their 
period of service to launch a real strategic missile. 
  At the same time as the "Topol" was flying to Kamchatka a 
group of Tu-160 strategic bombers was in the air above Russia. 
On a command from the Air Force central command and the General 
Staff central command the crew headed by Lieutenant Colonel 
Sergey Danilchenko launched a long-range cruise missile. A 
Northern Fleet nuclear-powered missile-armed submarine [atomnyy 
podvodnyy raketonosnyy kreyser] commanded by Captain 1st Rank 
Aleksandr Zheltyakov, on alert duty in an area of the Barents 
Sea, launched a ballistic missile in the direction of the test 
range on an order from Moscow. 
  All the missiles carried dummy rather than nuclear warheads, 
of course. 
  The fact that the full command headquarters exercises on 
Strategic Nuclear Forces command and control and the launching 
of three strategic missiles coincided with 22 June, a sacred 
date for most Russian citizens -- the 53d anniversary of the 
start of the Great Patriotic War -- was pure chance, I was told 
by the military. According to the schedule approved back at the 
end of last year, the exercises were to have started a day 
later, but it was decided to change the date at the president's 
request because he was flying to Corfu. 
  Finally. Comparisons are odious, but in 1799 a 
Russian-Turkish squadron commanded by Russian Admiral Fedor 
Ushakov stormed the island and fortress of Corfu, which was 
occupied by the French. Russia's military success served to 
strengthen its international authority and was the foundation 
for its new relations with the states of Europe. 
  Two hundred years on, on the eve of the meeting in Corfu 
with 
the heads of the leading states, Colonel Boris Yeltsin, supreme 
commander in chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, sent 
a Black Sea Fleet squadron to the island's shores and tested the 
combat readiness of his Strategic Nuclear Forces by launching 
three strategic missiles. But it is clear today that military 
success is not going to restore our state's former authority 
without victories in the economy, of course.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] We have just received a special report from the town 
of Plesetsk on a command and staff military exercise. As we 
have already reported, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev monitored [kontrolirovali] the 
exercise. 
  [Correspondent Mikhail Zotov] During the command and staff 
exercise of strategic missile troops in the area of test range 
No. 53 in Plesetsk today, a training launch of the Topol 
strategic intercontinental solid fuel missile was carried out. 
Its projected target area was Kamchatka. Adjacent countries 
were informed about the planned launch, and the flight of the 
missile was tracked by nine ground radars, which transmitted the 
data to a computer center in Plesetsk. The Russian defense 
minister and the commander in chief monitored the exercise. 
  In the opinion of military observers, the 100-tonne, RS-12M 
Topol launcher has shown once again the reliability and high 
quality of operation of all the systems and of the missile 
launch crew. Despite the fact that the strategic missile troops 
are experiencing many of the problems that are characteristic of 
the Army, the strategic missile troops still remain a reliable 
guarantor of Russia's security and independence. 
  The number of training launches, however, is dwindling with 
each passing year. The families of the servicemen who have 
decided to give up the difficult job of officer in the Russian 
Army are leaving the garrisons. For the time being, a few 35- 
or 40-year-old officers, who have not given up the protection of 
Russian borders in a difficult moment, ensure the combat 
training of missile troops.

<F P=106> [Article by Vasiliy Fatigarov of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and </F>
Aleksandr Mukomolov of the Russian Federation Federal 
Counterintelligence Service Public Relations Center, under the 
rubric "Crime Report": "Submachine Guns Made by Crooks..."] 
  [Text] It is no longer all that difficult to equip 
yourself with a factory-made weapon nowadays if you want one and 
you have the cash. Even "private gunsmiths" are not out of 
work. Custom-made weapons are in ever-increasing demand among 
the compatriots of Don Corleone.... 
  But in the opinion of Lieutenant Colonel of Militia Viktor 
Golovanov, deputy chief of the Moscow Criminal Investigation 
Department, it is too soon to talk about large-scale underground 
manufacture of firearms. In the main what we are talking about 
here is small-caliber hand guns, which are not difficult to 
make. In the capital this year more than 10 people have been 
detained carrying such guns in their pockets. Furthermore, 
home-made guns of this kind have been encountered before. 
  But attempts to make serious "pieces" have been noted. For 
example, at the Krasnogorsk Plant, which produces the well-known 
Zenit cameras, three "craftsmen" manufactured revolver parts 
which they then assembled at home. They worked this way for 
over six months. The creative endeavors of the Krasnogorsk 
Kulibins [reference to self-taught Russian engineer] were 
thwarted when the murder of a paramilitary security forces 
member was being investigated. 
  Also in 1993, counterintelligence agents became interested 
in 
the activity of a small enterprise housed in the workshops of 
the Varshavskoye subway depot. It transpired that initially 
swords and daggers were being forged there but when a certain 
T., a major weapons specialist, joined the small enterprise they 
switched to "batch" production of the PPT-93, a new type of 
submachine gun. The depot did not monitor the activity of Mr. T. 
and Co. and, as one of the operatives joked, eventually you 
might even see an armored train emerging from the subway tunnel. 
  T.'s activity was thwarted and nine PPT-3s, ammunition, and 
more than $10,000 were recovered. In addition, when the 
enterprise premises were searched, 39 rifle barrels and a large 
quantity of billets for various weapon spares were found. In 
short, production had been expanding.... 
  It has to be noted that the weapons made were of good 
quality. The parts -- the burnished steel sections and the fine 
wooden handles -- fitted together well. The 9-mm submachine 
guns were made especially for mafia showdowns -- they fire in 
short bursts, the scatter range is insignificant, the lethality 
is greater than the PM [Makarov pistol], and the magazines 
contain 20 or more Makarov pistol shells. It is obvious that T. 
had great experience of gun making, because all the 
manufacturing processes had been strictly observed. 
  In the words of Lieutenant General of Militia Vyacheslav 
Ogorodnikov, chief of the Main Directorate for Protecting Public 
Order, in the past three years the number of crimes involving 
the use of firearms has increased from 4,000 to 22,500. In the 
past year 1,366 pistols and revolvers, 1,946 automatic rifles, 
140 machine guns, six rocket launchers, and 33 grenade launchers 
have been confiscated from criminals. Weapons are not only 
obtained from the "hot spots" but are also stolen from arms 
dumps, and thefts from weapons plants are also on the increase. 
At the Tula Weapons Plant alone, 14 criminal groupings engaged 
in weapons theft were recently exposed. Automatic rifles had 
also been stolen from the Izhmash Production Association for 
subsequent sale. 
  So, regrettably, there is no problem in obtaining weapons. 
Russian-made, Chinese, Western -- whatever your taste. If you 
want something exotic, Mr. T. and his Krasnogorsk colleagues 
will oblige. Admittedly, this will cost you more, as will 
anything made to order in small batches. For example, a PPT-93 
cost half a million from a secondhand dealer at the beginning of 
1993 -- there is a market for it even as far away as Africa. 
However, sooner or later someone will have to answer for this.

he wanted. The Azerbaijani president thanked him for the sincere 
invitation, indicated that he has great respect for the Cuban 
leader Fidel Castro and the Cuban people, and in his turn 
invited the Cuban leaders, the Fidel and Raul Castro brothers, 
to visit Azerbaijan. 
  Geydar Aliyev briefed the guest on the developments in 
Azerbaijan in recent years, especially on Armenia's occupation 
of Azerbaijani soil. He added that the international 
organizations, particularly the CSCE and the Minsk Group, are 
trying to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Geydar 
Aliyev said that our brave sons, who are defending their 
motherland and waging a struggle for the indivisibility of the 
homeland, are courageously facing the enemy. 
  The guest said that Cuban society knows about the Karabakh 
conflict, and the members of the Cuban delegation indicated 
that, moved by the adage that you find out who are your true 
friends when times get tough, they are ready to help Azerbaijan 
in every way. 
  Matters pertaining to cooperation between the two states 
were 
broached during the meeting.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received 
today the Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi. Here 
is a report by our correspondent Sakit Ocagli: 
  [Ocagli] Various fields of cooperation with neighboring Iran 
were discussed during the formal talks. Geydar Aliyev noted 
that a number of documents on cooperation were signed during 
Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's visit to Baku last 
October and that special care is being taken to implement these 
documents. 
  The Azerbaijani president said he was deeply disturbed by 
the 
tragedy that occurred near Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad on the 
day of `Ashura, a holy day for all Moslems. He hoped that those 
individuals who showed (?hostility) to the sacred place of 
pilgrimage on that day will certainly be found and punished. 
Geydar Aliyev once again conveyed his condolences to the 
Iranian people in connection with the tragedy. 
  Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi said that as 
part of his contacts in Azerbaijan he visited the Ministry of 
Culture, the Azerbaijani State Television and Radio Broadcasting 
Company, and the Information Ministry, and briefed the president 
on his contacts and talks at these institutions. The Iranian 
guest noted that the talks on cooperation with Azerbaijan in the 
information field concluded that the two neighboring states, 
which have similar and close position on many issues, should pay 
attention to developing cultural ties. 
  Morteza Sarmadi also spoke of his contacts at the 
Azerbaijani 
Foreign Ministry. In his view, all his contacts during the 
visit was fruitful and constructive exchanges of views were held 
on problems needing solution. 
  The Azerbaijani President regarded his upcoming visit to 
Iran 
as yet another sign of the fruitfulness of today's talk. Noting 
the great importance of the upcoming visit, the Azerbaijani 
President Geydar Aliyev stressed the need to broaden the 
multifaceted cooperation with Iran.

  [Text] Baku, June 22 (TURAN) -- An agreement for allocation 
of a credit totalling 400,000 dollars was obtained between SOCAR 
[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan] and representatives of the 
World Bank. This amount will be spent on payment of experts, 
dealing with preparing the legal basis for oil fields' 
development in the Caspian Sea. This document will be based on 
the provisions and norms of international law, TURAN was told by 
SOCAR. 
  Early in June Russia's Foreign Ministry addressed with a 
statement, demanding to give Russia its share of riches of the 
Caspian Sea. Such actions of Russia excited members of the 
Consortium of western Oil Companies on the development of Azeri 
and Shirag oil fields in Azerbaijan section of the Caspian Sea. 
  The World Bank is also going to allocate a credit totalling 
11.6 million dollars for financial needs in gas and oil spheres.

  [Text] Baku (June 21) TURAN--Although the prices for bread 
were increased, the bread deficit in Azerbaijan still remains. 
The State Concern for bread products told TURAN that grain 
deliveries are delayed due to tension at the North-Caucasian 
railway. 
  The same source also said that 200 cars with grain 
travelling 
to Azerbaijan are presently at that railway. 
  On June 17 Turkey shipped 24,000 tons of grain to 
Azerbaijan. 
According to specialists, this grain delivery is unable to solve 
bread deficit in the country where every-day need in bread 
totals more than 2,000 tons. 
  An employee of the State Concern for bread products said 
that 
those who live in villages come to Baku to buy bread since, 
actually, bread is not delivered to Azerbaijani republics 
[plural as received]. This fact worsens the bread deficit in 
Azerbaijan as well.

    [Editorial Report] Minsk Radio Minsk Network in Belarusian 
on 23 June at 0900 GMT broadcasts the live "special newscast 
Presidential Marathon" moderated by Alyaksandr Awcharenka. 
  Awcharenka begins by saying that polling stations opened 
five 
hours earlier to elect "the first president in the history of 
Belarus," however this historic event was not accompanied by 
"crowds lining up to cast their votes." He adds that according 
to reports from various oblasts, voting is still "gaining 
momentum." 
  Correspondent Ivan Hladkin, reporting live from the Central 
Electoral Commission, says that 7,326,550 people are "included 
on the lists for voting by secret ballot." Over the 10 days 
granted by the law for those unable to come to the polls on 23 
June, some 279,938 people have cast their votes, which amounts 
to 3.8 percent of the total number of voters. As of 0900 GMT, 
39.1 percent of voters have come to the polls in Brest Oblast 
and voting has been completed at 15 polling stations: 

  -  In Gomel Oblast -- 38 percent have voted, voting completed 
at 11 polling stations; 
  -  In Vitebsk Oblast -- 37.2 percent, 
voting completed at 19 polling stations; 
  -  In Mogilev Oblast -- 35 
percent, voting completed at five polling stations; 
  -  In Grodno 
Oblast -- 33.6 percent, voting completed at 12 polling 
stations; 
  -  In Minsk Oblast -- 33.2 percent, voting completed at 
five polling stations. 
"Only" 20 percent of voters have turned out by 0900 in the city 
of Minsk. 

  According to Hladkin, a number of people's deputies 
representing Popular Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak have sent a 
motion to the Central Electoral Commission claiming that at one 
of the polling stations in Smalyavichskiy Rayon, people were 
forced to vote for one of the candidates. The commission has 
passed the motion to the prosecutor's office. Several other 
"petty" violations have been monitored at other stations. 
  Vyachaslaw Makalchuk, reporter from Pinsk, then makes a 
telephone call to the studio and briefs the listeners on the 
situation in the city and the cost of holding the elections in 
the city. Makalchuk says that voter turnout has been "good" and 
by 1000 GMT "a majority of Pinsk Oblast voters" will have cast 
their votes. 
  Program moderator Awcharenka then reads a report received 
from the Belarusian Embassy in the United States, which says 
that the Boston city administration resolved to "hoist a 
Belarusian flag over the city on 23-25 June" as a "symbol of 
solidarity of one democratic state with another." 
  Program moderator Awcharenka then concludes the program 
saying that the next live connection with the Central Electoral 
Commission will be at 1200 GMT.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolai Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The parliament's Chairman Mechyslaw Hryb said he was 
ready to assume the responsibilities of the head of state if for 
some reason the Central Election Commission recognized invalid 
the presidential elections on June 23. 
  He said at a press conference in Minsk on Tuesday [21 June] 
that in accordance with the Constitution the powers of the 
president would automatically go to the parliament's speaker if 
the elections failed to take place. 
  Hryb avoided prognostication of the results of the coming 
elections and refused to say for whom he would vote. 
  Hryb said that the future president must concentrate on 
achievement of accord in the society. "No prosperity and 
well-being for the people can be achieved without accord," he 
stressed. 
  Certain media editions blamed the Central Election 
Commission 
for the particular attention attributed by Belarusian television 
to the election campaigns of some of the candidates for the 
presidency. 
  Tens of foreign monitors have arrived in Belarus in order to 
control the elections. Hundreds of journalists from the CIS and 
other countries will be reporting on the presidential elections. 
  However, the poll conducted by the Institute of Sociology 
under the Belarusian Academy of Sciences on Tuesday showed that 
about 80 percent of Belarusian voters would not come to ballot 
boxes. All the same, this does not mean that the president will 
be elected in the first round, experts said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich </F>
by correspondents at BTK Television studio in Minsk; questioners 
identified by caption -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Valeriy Drazdow, Minsk 
NARODNAYA GAZETA] What prevented Prime Minister Kebich from 
conducting the kind of policy he promised to conduct after his 
election? 
  [Kebich] Can you imagine entering your house and seeing that 
everything has been stolen? What would be the first reaction of 
any man? How to go on living? Where to find money? This is 
roughly what happened here. We had a union and good close ties. 
We did not have to think how to sell our products or from where 
to get raw materials -- everything worked perfectly. Then, we 
tore this union apart and found ourselves in a ransacked house. 
How could I resolve all these issues in these times of trouble? 
Every year I spent some four months in parliament arguing with 
lawmakers. You remember that as soon as I would enter the 
session hall, the issue of confidence in the government would be 
brought up; then lawmakers would demand a report on how we 
planned to overcome the crisis. It went on every minute of 
every day. Thus, it happened that we were in opposition to one 
another -- the Executive and Legislative Branches. We still do 
not have the vertical structure of executive power and the 
government cannot influence many processes in the Republic. 
That is why the president, who will have much greater powers, 
will be able to expeditiously implement his decisions and form 
that vertical structure. We need tough laws and their rapid 
implementation. [passage omitted] 
  [Mikalay Shcherbachenya, Minsk RESPUBLIKA] The future of the 
society which you are going to build is primarily based on 
economic and political union with Russia. If you fail to form 
such a union, have you considered any other options? 
  [Kebich] The building of the future society is not my idea 
alone -- we are building it and this is written in our 
Constitution. With regard to your question about union with 
Russia and possible options, I would be a weak politician if I 
burnt all my bridges behind me. There are other options, but I 
do not want to speak about them at this point. However I am 
positive and consider this the goal of the rest of my life to 
join our interests not only with Russia, but with Ukraine as 
well. If we agree to consider today as the starting point, I am 
sure that the union will definitely be formed within a year. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Drazdow, NARODNAYA GAZETA] Russia itself, however, is 
speeding toward an abyss -- plants are closing down, chaos, 
inflation...[pauses] What is the sense of such unification? 
  [Kebich] We are uniting our economies and not gangsterism, 
chaos, or bankrupt enterprises. On the contrary, we are getting 
access to good contacts. Russia's first deputy defense minister 
visited us some time long ago. He promised that Russia will 
provide contacts for all military enterprises. We will only 
take good things from Russia and leave all the bad things behind. 
  [Uladzimir Lehankow, Minsk BELARUSSKAYA NIVA] Speaking about 
economic and monetary union -- discussions are being held over 
its fifth article. Has there been any progress in this 
direction? 
  [Kebich] I declare that the fifth article will be amended 
and we will not tangle with the Constitution. President Yeltsin 
has promised that the Belarusian Bank will enjoy all the rights 
of a national bank. That is why the fifth article will be 
amended. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified reporter] What economic program do you 
suggest, being an outstanding economist and experienced 
politician. Will the Republic overcome the crisis by the end of 
1994? 
  [Kebich] There is a candidate who proposes a program worth 
two years of U.S. budgets, another one promises that as soon as 
he comes to power he will give each citizen $150. The closer 
the elections, the more generous the promises. However, I want 
to ask him: Where did he get those dollars? Was it a gift from 
someone? If it was a gift, what promises did he make to receive 
it? He does not have this money! That is why I want to say 
that by the end of 1994 we would like to stop the economic slump 
and improve the situation in 1995. That is why I want to say 
overtly and honestly: Do not believe those who promise you pie 
in the sky. 
  [Reporter] How are you going to fight inflation? 
  [Kebich] We cannot allow high unemployment. That is why to 
stabilize the situation we probably should not reduce inflation 
to 7 percent. We must curb it, and we have substantially curbed 
it. Everything should be done within reasonable limits. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Popular Front Chairman Zyanon </F>
Paznyak by unidentified reporter at the BTK Television studio in 
Minsk on the "Presidential Rostrum" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] How will Belarusian-Russian 
relations develop when you become president? 
  [Paznyak] I believe that this is one of the key questions. 
Eastern policy, in particular our relations with Russia, will 
undoubtedly be a priority in our foreign political activities. 
What is my vision of this policy? I think that we should 
strive for initiating equal, partner-like relations with our 
eastern neighbor. This is very relevant, and Belarus should come 
forward with this initiative. I think that we will have to hold 
negotiations on this issue with the Russian president. We will 
have to try and organize a meeting and clear up all the issues 
concerning Russia, Belarus, and our mutual interests, the more 
so since quite a number of these issues have piled up. We are 
just as interested in good relations as Russia, given that 
Belarus is the state through which Russia can maintain contacts 
with the West. That is why we have things to discuss and must 
see them through to completion. I believe that the president of 
Russia is the right type of leader and the kind of politician 
with which we can discuss and resolve these problems. 
  [Reporter] People sometimes ask whether [Russian Prime 
Minister] Chernomyrdin would like to conduct business with 
President Paznyak. As we know, Vyachaslaw Kebich's trump card 
is the allegation that Chernomyrdin will refuse to deal with 
anybody other than Kebich. 
  [Paznyak] The prime minister of Russia will be dealing with 
the prime minister of Belarus, while the president of Russia 
will be dealing with his Belarusian counterpart. This is the 
procedure. 
  [Reporter] The administration frightens people with 
cock-and-bull stories saying that once Paznyak assumes the post, 
Russians will be told to go back to Russia. 
  [Paznyak] I must say that this is a hackneyed propaganda 
cliche. Still, this issue seems to worry many people, because 
many people treat the propaganda campaign very seriously. That 
is why I want to state clearly and precisely: Nobody, including 
myself, is going to drive Russians out of Belarus. This is 
absolutely absurd. Our task, including mine, will be to 
guarantee all Belarusian citizens, including ethnic Russians, a 
life that would be better than in Russia itself. Our task is to 
make Russians in Belarus feel that market reforms, democracy, 
and the freedoms for which we have been fighting will provide 
them with significant privileges. The Belarusian Popular Front 
[BNF] was the first to address the issues of the rights for 
ethnic minorities, religious groups, and cultural-national 
autonomy. The BNF addressed these issues in its first program; 
BNF deputies initiated their discussion in the legislature. The 
development of the law-governed state which we are advocating, 
reform, and the sociopolitical ideas championed by the BNF will 
guarantee civic peace in Belarus. It was the BNF that lobbied 
the idea of single Belarusian citizenship. The Law on 
Citizenship was almost entirely drafted by the BNF and the 
Supreme Soviet had to adopt it. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] How many times a month will prices be increased 
if you become president? 
  [Paznyak] From the first days of my presidency, I will 
pursue such a policy as to stop price increases altogether. 
This will be done in the following way: A national currency 
will be introduced, appropriate policy will be conducted, and 
appropriate laws adopted to prevent the senseless issuance of 
credits. Production output will increase -- all these measures 
will help curb price increases and stabilize the situation. The 
stabilization of prices is the primary task of reform. Later, 
when this stabilization is achieved and reform continues, the 
situation will diametrically change; and, having curbed 
inflation, we will gradually arrive at a normal price structure. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Kebich took out a lot of credits. How will 
President Paznyak deal with that issue? 
  [Paznyak] In October 1992, Belarus had no debts. Today, our 
per capita debt is around $200. I discussed this problem at my 
meeting with President Clinton at the beginning of 1994. I 
asked why the United States was granting loans to the current 
government, which was not using them properly. The credits are 
being eaten away and embezzled -- we checked that. The 
government is granted credits, which later will have to be paid 
back by the people. We will start paying them back as early as 
1996, when this government will have resigned and its officials 
are off living in their villas. That is why I suggested that 
credits be given to finance economic reform. I was happy to 
hear the U.S. State Department announce 10 days later that the 
United States was going to take such a stance with regard to 
credits. We will have to pay back those debts, but my 
government will try to put an end to embezzlements and improper 
use of funds, after which this capital will be used to finance 
economic reform. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] What is your attitude toward the unification of 
monetary systems? 
  [Paznyak] I have addressed this issue many times and I want 
to repeat that my attitude is absolutely negative, because this 
is a bluff. Russian economists, including Gaydar, and our 
experts have both proven in detail that this is an impossible 
operation. Nevertheless, this process is continuing. What is 
the essence of the unification? Instead of the unification of 
two monetary systems, the merging of two mafia clans, the Moscow 
clan and the Belarusian clan, is under way. Such clans have 
been formed in Russia and Belarus, and they have access to 
governing the state and they currently have common interests. 
The mafia is going international and becoming more integrated. 
The monetary merger is actually the unification of the 
interests of two clans. The Moscow grouping aims to grab our 
property by legal methods, have a guarantee of free transit of 
Russian gas and oil via Belarus. The military-industrial 
complex and certain political forces in Russia are interested in 
preserving nuclear arms and antiaircraft defense units on 
Belarusian soil. The Belarusian grouping has interests of its 
own, the primary one being to avoid responsibility for 
corruption and the collapse of the economy; shift this burden 
onto the shoulders of the Moscow administrations. They will 
also have guarantees that what they have managed to grab will 
not be taken away. This is a very grave problem, for we will be 
staying on our land but have no property. I am categorically 
against such policy, which has been continuing for eight months 
now. To what has it led? Belarus has lost one-third of its 
GNP; we are losing 25 billion rubles per day; business activity 
has stopped; investments frozen; plants are being closed down.

  [Text] Comrat, BASAPRESS, 18/6/1994 -- "We have made too 
many concessions regarding the "Gagauz-Eri" special juridical 
status to the Chisinau officials and we decided not to accept 
any more compromises," told BASA Maria Marunevich, from the 
Gagauz Parliamentary Presidium. "We will insist that President 
Snegur and Speaker Lucinschi sign the last variant of the 
project agreed upon in the last meeting between Moldovan top 
leadership, president Topal, and Gagauz Speaker Kendigelyan and 
that this project be examined by parliamentary factions and 
adopted by the Moldovan Parliament," added Marunevich. 
Referring to Suleyman Demirel's recent visit to Comrat, she 
expressed concern that "several statements were made recently 
that contradict the Gagauzians' wish for self-determination." 
The newspaper HABERLAR stated on this issue that "certain 
internal divergences between Comrat and Ciadir-Lunga could not 
be concealed from the eyes of the guests. The Turkish guests 
felt that some speakers avoided the usage of terms `Gagauz 
Republic' and `Gagaouzia'; they preferred to use such terms as 
`our region,' `the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians' or 
merely `the Ciadar-Lunga district.' This happened despite the 
fact that Suleyman Demirel himself repeatedly said that he did 
not come to a certain district, but to Gagauz peoples, to 
Gagauzia." According to Marunevich, "the Gagauz-press agency 
called this an event that politically damaged Gagauzia's 
position as Demirel's visit had utterly different motives."

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 18/6/1994 -- A meeting of the 
departments of foreign relations experts from the Ukraine and 
Moldova is to be held at the end of July. The meeting will 
discuss issues concerning the frontiers between the two states, 
declared to BASA a representative of the Moldovan Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MAE). Initially, the Ukrainian MAE suggested 
the meeting to be organized at the end of June, but the Chisinau 
officials requested it to be postponed for a month, for they 
wanted better to prepare for it. The cited source stated that a 
visit to Kiev by the vice-premier Valentin Cunev was scheduled 
for the first half of June. Cunev was to discuss issues 
concerning interstate collaboration in the fields of 
transportation, economics, and exploitation of sea vacation 
houses. The visit was postponed because the new Ukrainian 
chamber of ministers was not yet formed.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- No new ambassador 
to Russia was named after Anatol Taranu's recent resignation. 
Alexandru Buruian, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, declared to 
BASA that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet nominated 
any candidate to the post of ambassador to the Russian 
Federation. Decisions of this type are first examined by state 
leaders," he mentioned. Buruian affirmed that the views of the 
future ambassador on the problem of the 14th Army's withdrawal 
will not constitute a criterion of selection for the future 
chief of the Moldovan diplomatic mission to Moscow. "The fact 
that previously the Moldovan delegation at the negotiations was 
headed by the ex-ambassador to Russia Anatol; scan was rather a 
coincidence. In my opinion, the activity of the ambassador 
could have been more efficient if he had not led the Moldovan 
party at the negotiations. The activity of the ambassador to 
Russia should involve all aspects of the Moldovan-Russian 
relations, while the 14th Army problem is just one element of 
these relations," stressed the Moldovan vice-minister of foreign 
affairs.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- The recent 
meeting of the Moldovan and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs 
reconfirmed the intention to finalize a timetable for the 14th 
Army's withdrawal in the 9th round of negotiations to be held in 
Chisinau, stated to BASA Vasile Sova, head of the CIS Direction 
of the Moldovan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During the Moscow 
negotiations, the Russian side proposed to withdraw the 14th 
Army within three years of the signing of the basic agreement. 
Taking into account Russia's experience in this field, the 
Moldovan side proposed that the troops located in Eastern 
Moldova be withdrawn within 1.5 years by 1 January 1996, 
mentioned Sova. Experts will have to examine thoroughly the 
technical conditions for the withdrawal by using the method 
approved by the military departments of the both sides in the 
eighth round of negotiations held in April. An agreement was 
reached on the share of expenses to be defrayed by Moldova for 
the relocation of the Russian troops. According to Sova, 
Chisinau proposed to deploy the funds earned from the sales of 
the 14th Army's properties. It was proposed that Russian 
soldiers have the right to privatize the flats they inhabited in 
Moldova and to use the profits from the sales to buy others in 
Russia. The Moldovan delegation opposed the allotment of funds 
for Russian soldiers from the Moldovan budget. Sova said that 
the Moldovan budget did not provide for such expenses. According 
to him, during a meeting with representatives of the Ukrainian 
and Moldovan diplomatic departments, Chisinau was assured that 
Kiev officials will not oppose the Russian troops' crossing of 
the Ukraine. "We have no reasons for believing that the Ukraine 
will be an obstacle, but this is a delicate issue that requires 
elaboration of detailed plans for the withdrawal," mentioned 
Sova.

  [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 17/6/1994 -- According to the 
estimations of the Moldovan Ministry of Defense (MD) experts, 
all units of the 14th Russian Army could be withdrawn within 
four months after the necessary documents are signed, declared 
to BASA Colonel Ion Gurulea, chief of the MD Engineering 
Department, permanent member of the Moldovan delegation at the 
Moldovan-Russian negotiations on the withdrawal of the 14th 
Army. Gurulea specified that the document stipulating the 
withdrawal of these troops forces both Russia and Moldova to 
negotiate with the Ukraine concerning the transportation of the 
armament on its railways. Anatol Cosciug, chief of the MD 
Department of Military Policy and Negotiations, declared to BASA 
that technically all the units of the 14th Army can be withdrawn 
in the time-frame suggested by the Moldovan delegation, the 
deadline being 31 December 1995-1 January 1996. Cosciug also 
stated that the political aspect of the problem is often 
exaggerated, as the withdrawal of the Russian troops is also 
conditioned by the socio-political situation in Dniester. The 
cited source also specified that no alterations were made in the 
technical aspects of the agreements.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- Yesterday, 16 
June, the Moldovan Parliament ratified the Agreement on mutual 
recognition of rights and settlement of property ownership 
within the ClS. Promoting the necessity of ratifying the October 
1992 agreement signed in Bishkek by nine states, Andrei Cucu, 
privatization vice minister, stated that this agreement pertains 
first of all to Russia, where Moldova possesses 11 wine plants, 
three construction organizations and numerous branches of joint 
ventures founded by Moldovan economic agents. Russia, in its 
turn, has several enterprises in Moldova and the largest is the 
"Sovtransavto" haulage enterprise. Russia ratified the Bishkek 
agreement in November 1993. Cucu told BASA that most important 
is that Russia will recognize Moldova's rights over its 
properties in Russian territory. Thus, a proper foundation for 
their future privatization will be created. "Our enterprises in 
Russia employ Russian personnel and, vice versa, Russian 
enterprises in Moldova employ Moldovan personnel who will be 
allowed to participate in their privatization," said Cucu. The 
Ukraine did not sign the mutual property rights agreement. Cucu 
mentioned that an accord with the Ukraine will be established 
through a bilateral agreement which is now being elaborated. He 
pointed out that the agreement mainly concerns the numerous 
vacation houses located in the Ukraine. Cucu said that in 1993 
Russia and the Ukraine signed an agreement on recognizing the 
rights over the properties located outside their borders.

  [Text] The Moldovan police held a cargo with a radioactive 
substance from Russia Tuesday [22 June]. Officials in the 
Interior Ministry's organized crime department told INTERFAX 
that one Russian and two Moldovan citizens had been apprehended 
as they tried to smuggle a radioactive substance into Moldova 
and sell it for $20,000. 
  The officials said that gamma-cobalt-60 had been obtained 
and 
put into a container in Russia and that the weight of the cargo 
and its destination were being determined. 
  This is the first time the Moldovan police have found 
material of this high quality and packed so thoroughly. A small 
radioactive leak was detected that could be hazardous. 
  Experts from the Moldovan Academy of Sciences are trying to 
determine to what use the cobalt was to be put. 
  The officials also said that a Romanian citizen is suspected 
of being the customer who had ordered the cargo but there was 
insufficient evidence for his arrest.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Agafonov: "G-7 Will Demand Quicker Reforms </F>
From Ukraine, and in Exchange Will Promise Aid on the Russian 
Model"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- According to leaks from Japanese 
Government sources, at the G-7 meeting in Naples the forum's 
fundamental document -- the economic declaration -- will for the 
first time include specific mention of the need to grant 
large-scale Western assistance to poor Ukraine. 
  According to Japanese information, the draft G-7 
declaration, 
which has already been drawn up, notes that the economic crisis 
in Ukraine has reached serious proportions and sovereign Kiev 
needs emergency Western aid so as not to slip into an abyss of 
instability and upheavals. The document proposes the holding 
urgently, in the fall of this year (and most likely in Canada), 
of a special G-7 meeting at ministerial level to discuss the 
details of both an aid package and a mechanism for granting the 
aid. A special meeting like this has been held only once before 
-- in Tokyo in April of last year, and on that occasion Western 
aid for the Russian reforms was on the agenda. 
  The appearance of a clause on Ukraine in the fundamental 
document of the G-7 summit-level forum is, according to the 
Japanese version, attributable to two "firefighting" factors -- 
a further deterioration in the situation in Ukraine could result 
in dangerous consequences for international nuclear security in 
view of the existence on Ukrainian territory of nuclear weapons 
and the still operating Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station; and an 
escalation of the economic crisis could blow apart the political 
situation in Ukraine and present Europe with a "second 
Yugoslavia." 
  The initiative to put the Ukrainian question on the G-7 
agenda, the Japanese sources note, comes from Italy, and the 
subject itself was raised for discussion for the first time by 
the special personal representatives of the G-7 heads of state 
at the end of last week. The proposed pattern of economic aid 
to Kiev is thus far virtually a total repetition of the Russian 
version -- it is a question of granting credits from the IMF, 
the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Developments, conditional on further progress in Ukraine's 
economic transformations. Here the G-7 intends to urge Kiev to 
proceed more quickly along the path of reforms. 
  The volume of possible loans to keep the Ukrainian economy 
afloat remains a big secret -- there is not even a hint of this 
in the utterances of informed sources.

U.S. Ambassador William Green Miller at his request. During a 
sincere conversation touching on a broad range of issues, they 
deeply analyzed the state of Ukrainian-U.S. relations in the 
field of economic cooperation. The ambassador was informed 
about the economic and social problems facing the Government of 
Ukraine today and about ways to reform the economy taking into 
account the approaches expounded by the prime minister during 
the confirmation of his appointment by the Supreme Council. 
  They also discussed the implementation of the agreements on 
economic assistance to Ukraine -- first and foremost, in 
organizing the production of medical preparations and on 
financial support for entrepreneurship. Issues pertaining to 
the forthcoming discussion by the G-7 leaders regarding energy 
supplies for Ukraine were also discussed, in particular, on 
providing help in developing and improving the safety of nuclear 
power engineering. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko took part in the 
conversation.

  [Text] Kiev -- As a UNIAN correspondent learned on 22 June, 
Ukraine's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the 
Republic of Belarus Volodymyr Zheliba sent a letter to Ukraine's 
Prime Minister Vitaliy Masol. The letter, in particular, 
indicates that for Belarus, Ukraine ranks second, following 
Russia, as far as foreign political aspect is concerned, and 
expresses concern at the state of Ukrainian-Belarusian 
relations, at the absence of contacts at the top state level, 
and also absence of proper trade and economic relations. 
  "We are convinced that the state of bilateral cooperation 
must be considered at the high governmental level in the very 
near future," believes Volodymyr Zheliba. 
  The letter also says that Ukraine occupies the second place 
(14.9 percent), following Russia (69 percent), in trade and 
economic relations with Belarus, however the establishment of a 
joint trade house has been put off. No agreement has been 
concluded between the banks on mutual settlements and credit 
relations. Also, in the opinion of the Belarusian side, the 
issue of liabilities between our states remains unsettled.

  [Text] Kiev, 22 Jun -- The Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 
'Ali Akbar Velayati has sent a letter to Ukraine's Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko concerning the developments in Crimea 
following a decision by the autonomy's Supreme Council to 
restore the Crimean Republic's Constitution of 1992. 
  "The Islamic Republic of Iran is convinced," the letter 
stresses, "that this problem must be solved on the basis of full 
adherence to the principles of international law: Respect of 
sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of borders, 
nonviolent conflict resolution, and noninterference in the 
states' internal affairs." The author of the letter noted that 
the "Crimean issue" was Ukraine's internal problem and could be 
resolved peacefully. Dr. Velayati stressed that Iran strived to 
achieve the above goal by means of mutual trust and peaceful 
coexistence.

  [Text] Ukraine's debt to Western creditors and former 
Soviet republics stands at $6 billion, Ukrainian Deputy Finance 
Minister Boris Sobolev told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  He said that this sum includes credits received and already 
used, as well as "the difference between Ukrainian exports to 
these countries and imports from them." The debt to the CIS 
countries slightly exceeds $4.3 billion, including $2.7 billion 
to Russia, $693 million to Turkmenistan, $28 million to Moldova, 
and $1.3 million to Kazakhstan. 
  The debt to Western countries mostly consists of the 
commitments against the export credits extended to Ukraine by 
the U.S., Germany, and the European Union. 
  Sobolev announced that the total amount of Western credits, 
used by Ukraine stood at about $1 billion. In addition to this, 
Kiev concluded agreements on $2.5 billion worth of loans. 
  Sobolev said that Ukraine was not delaying repayment of 
debts 
to Western creditors. He admitted, however, that Ukraine's 
debts to the CIS countries, including Russia, were not being 
paid back regularly. He said that the debt problem was closely 
connected with that of dividing the former Soviet Union's assets 
and liabilities which is still to be solved. 
  A foreign debt department is to be set up at the Ukrainian 
Finance Ministry to monitor the servicing of the debts, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Olga Musafirova: "Kravchuk Speaks </F>
Russian in Odessa... and It's No Joke"] 
  [Text] During Ostankino's Kiev-Moscow radio phone-in, 
Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, at the request of the moderator, 
told a funny story -- an inoffensive one -- about himself. And 
he noted that the mockery of the personality of the president of 
Ukraine had appreciably subsided. 
  I think that the underground political joke factory located 
somewhere on the territory of our neighboring state or perhaps 
overseas has simply stopped financing "Kravchuk stories." 
Kravchuk's own actions have begun to outstrip the humor and 
satire. 
  Let me therefore give you a pure fable: The Organization of 
Ukrainian Nationalists [OUN] has decided to take up the 
environment, and it has come out with the slogan "Protect the 
forests! We still need them..." But now for real events: A 
large OUN gathering held in Kiev has confirmed that its members 
support Kravchuk, as they regard him as the sole guarantor of a 
"cohesive, democratic, rule-of-law, national Ukrainian state." 
  If I were an inhabitant of sunny Odessa, which Leonid 
Makarovich visited the other day, I would want to kick myself on 
reading the news about the OUN, because in Odessa Kravchuk 
actually managed to please everyone. He communicated 
effortlessly with the citizens in good Russian, advocating 
official bilingualism, and said a lot of positive things about 
the advantages of a free economic zone -- the long-cherished 
dream of a free port, friendship with Russia, and also the 
dangers of national isolationism.... 
  Only an outstanding politician is capable of winning the 
favor of people with diametrically opposed views from different 
regions of the country and securing their backing when less than 
a week remains before the election. Having essentially made a 
mess of his "Five D's" program -- sovereignty, democracy, 
prosperity, and so forth [in the vernacular the five 
constituents of the program begin with the letter "d"] -- which 
constituted the promises of the last election, Leonid Kravchuk 
now highlights two other achievements of the past period. His 
achievement, like Brezhnev and Gorbachev's, of international 
prestige and of the state's full involvement [polnopravnoye 
vklyucheniye] in the European Union. And success in the domestic 
arena, where the sparks of conflict have nevertheless not 
inflamed a civil war. 
  However, amid the election fever the president's support 
group has demonstrated -- I would say -- enthusiasm in excess of 
the plan. The usual slogan "Kravchuk means peace!" has been 
augmented by the warning "And Kuchma means war!" The relations 
between the two leading contenders are no longer being concealed 
from voters. On 13 June the president's adviser on political 
questions, Nikolay Mikhalchenko, gave a long interview to 
Ukraine's World Radio Service. It would be naive to think that 
the statements were made by him without the agreement of his 
immediate boss. First, Mikhalchenko asked the Ukrainian 
population in the Crimea to consider why they are so 
underrepresented in the autonomous republic's Supreme Soviet, 
given the powerful "de facto Russian community." And he then 
gave a long and detailed expose of the Russian stooge, Leonid 
Kuchma, concluding his thesis on a high note. "I know, for 
example, that if ever any president wished to incorporate 
Ukraine in Russia as a subordinate territory and discard its 
independence, West and Central Ukraine could cause a civil war 
in Ukraine." 
  Is it being honest toward Ukraine and its people, to which 
the presidential oath swears loyalty, to set the West against 
the East, Lvov against Crimea today, and all to get your rival's 
name boldly struck out on the voting slip? Is it being honest 
to take 52 million people to the brink of disaster while 
bestowing smiles right and left or to utter, if you lose, the 
classic parting words of advice: "Don't give anyone a hard 
time!"? 
  A week has passed since Mikhalchenko's appearance on 
Ukraine's World Radio Service. The president has in no way 
repudiated his political adviser's words. 
  However, honesty for a politician bent on winning an 
election 
at any price is a mere hangover from the past. One of the state 
structures has carried out the latest republic poll to ascertain 
which of the candidates' personal qualities dominate in the 
electors' minds. The poll makes clear that inscrutability, 
secretiveness, and flexibility are the most striking features of 
the current president's image. The majority of respondents were 
unable to judge whether Leonid Makarovich possesses qualities 
such as kindness, strength, or decency and unable to determine 
the features of his political makeup -- whether he is a democrat 
or a dictator....

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Moroz, speaker of the Ukrainian </F>
parliament, by unidentified VYBIR reporter; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] Vybir: Will you promote the development of private 
business if elected the president? 
  O.M.: Yes, I will. The main thing is that such business 
should not be criminal. 
  Vybir: What are the ways to overcome the Crimean crisis? 
  O.M.: The only way is for the Ukrainian and Crimean 
parliaments to observe the Constitution of Ukraine. My visit to 
the peninsula is intended to reach this goal. It was a mistake 
on the part of our ruling bodies to neglect situation in the 
Crimea. I want to explain to the Crimean parliamentarians the 
position of our parliament and my personal position to this 
effect. 
  Vybir: Will left-wingers win the June 26 elections? Given 
this, will Ukraine change its foreign policy? 
  O.M.: Left-wing views start to dominate in our society. 
People understand that their prosperity depends on common 
efforts. This means that the broad public will mainly back up 
the left-wing candidates to the Soviets and the president's 
post. Ukraine's foreign policy will also be somewhat changed. 
Left-wing orientation is going strong all over the world. This 
process brings our civilization to optimal alignment of 
political forces. I believe that sharp political turns (whether 
to the right or left) should not physically or morally affect 
men in the street. Still, the foreign policy concept was fixed 
by the parliament and will not undergo cardinal changes. 
Everything depends on situation in the countries with which we 
will cooperate. 
  Vybir: What about the possibility of Ukraine's entering into 
NATO? 
  O.M.: Look, NATO is not the world community. Ukraine has 
always been and wants to remain an active member of such 
community. I do not want Ukraine to enter military blocs, I 
want it to be respected by the world community. Ukraine is the 
only country that declared its nuclear-free status and 
liquidates its nuclear arms. Unfortunately, other countries do 
not follow our example. Ukraine could initiate creation of the 
international club of the countries that wish to liquidate their 
nuclear weapons. 
  Vybir: What will be the Ukrainian-Russian relations? 
  O.M.: Russia is a great neighboring state having 
historically 
strong ties with Ukraine. People should adequately understand 
our history. 
  Vybir: Who is your strongest rival in presidential 
elections? 
  O.M.: All of them are strong enough. If they were weak, it 
would not be of great interest to me to run for presidency. 
  Vybir: What about your chances to be elected? 
  O.M.: They are rather high. 
  Vybir: What is the difference between you and other 
nominees? 
  O.M.: Unlike me, almost all of them occupied high official 
posts. I am not responsible for the consequences of the 
so-called economic reforms. Frankly speaking, among other 
candidates only I know well the problems of people. I do not 
accuse my rivals since they were "separated" from such problems. 
  Vybir: Why do so many people negatively assess the actions 
of 
President Kravchuk? 
  O.M.: This is because of the consequences of the policy 
conducted by the highest authorities while the president 
represents such authorities. This was proved by the results of 
parliamentary elections. 
  Vybir: Many people think that the Crimean crisis occurred as 
a result of sending some additional Ukrainian troops to the 
peninsula... 
  O.M.: Last Saturday I met with Interior and Defense 
Ministers. I proposed not to send additional troops and 
national guard to the Crimea. We must not use force but 
economic and political arguments. 
  Vybir: Will the president's powers be limited? 
  O.M.: This will be hard to do since such changes limitations 
must be fixed by the Constitution. If I am elected the 
president, I will enhance economic powers of the Cabinet. As I 
see it, today the president has too many functions which he is 
unable to perform in full scope. Still the president decides 
all personnel questions relating to the government. So, 
delegation of economic functions to the government helps the 
president fulfill his duties more efficiently. My cabinet will 
never hinder the process of reforms that are really useful for 
Ukraine. 
  Vybir: What are the ways to divide the Black Sea Fleet? 
  O.M.: As far as military interests are concerned, Ukraine 
gains nothing from the Fleet division. I often proposed to 
lease the Fleet either to Russia or the CIS. I am afraid that 
Russia may refuse to take lease of the Fleet or buy out a part 
of it. Given this, Ukraine will never be able to finance this 
huge Fleet. All this is relevant to economic restructuring. For 
instance, Ukrainian metal is sold all over the world which 
testifies to our mighty industrial potential. But on the other 
hand, it proves that we are bad businessmen because not a single 
country sells its rolled stock. The Ukrainian ship-building 
industry is one of the world biggest, it accounts for 80 percent 
of the USSR capacity in this field. Today it mainly works for 
export. Why don't we also use it to build our own merchant 
fleet or men-of-war? 
  Vybir: Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Pikhovshek: "Finish of Presidential </F>
Marathon"] 
  [Text] The presidential marathon is nearing its end. 
There are seven presidential nominees (often called "big 
seven"), and only a few of them have real chances to win. The 
state press, whose circulation has dramatically decreased, were 
the first to show their sympathies to this or that nominee. 
"HOLOS UKRAYINY" (parliament's newspaper) has the circulation 
of just 325,000 copies while "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (workers' 
gazette) -- 90,000. This concerns not only the state press, but 
also the popular "KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI" (Kiev news) and once 
mighty "VECHIRNIY KYYIV" (Kiev at night) -- 185,000 and 36,000, 
respectively. Even such small numbers of copies create the 
illusion of influence in the broad public. Last week, "HOLOS 
UKRAYINY" published 10 articles supporting Kravchuk's 
candidature and seven articles backing up Speaker Moroz. The 
articles supporting Moroz were the biggest (17,500 characters) 
which is quite natural since the newspaper belongs to the 
parliament. At the same time, "ROBITNYCHA HAZETA" (founded by 
the Cabinet and interregional association of businessmen) 
published just one but big article (13,000 characters) 
supporting the candidature of L.Kuchma. According to poll 
results, 27 percent of the electors will vote for Kravchuk, 20 
percent for Kuchma, 11 percent for Moroz (sociologic center 
"Socis"); 35 percent for Kuchma, 20 percent for Kravchuk, 10 
percent for Moroz (sociologic center "Ukrainian barometer"); 37 
percent for Kuchma, 27 percent for Kravchuk, 16 percent for 
Lanovyy (sociologic center "News"). So, the basic contenders 
are Kuchma and Kravchuk. Regional studies in Ukraine's south 
and east show the following: 21 percent for Kuchma, 7 percent 
for Kravchuk, 4 percent for Moroz (center "Democratic 
initiatives"); 23 percent for Kuchma, 19 percent for Kravchuk, 
10 percent for Moroz (center "Naval- express"). It is evident 
that Kuchma and Kravchuk will win the first round but it is hard 
to say who will be elected the President. The basic role here 
belongs to the central Ukraine having 10-15 percent of electors 
who still have not decided whom to support -- Kuchma or 
Kravchuk. Taking into account the fact that all votes of 
Plyushch and Talanchuk will go to Kravchuk like part of the 
votes of Lanovyy and Moroz, while the other part and all votes 
of Babych will go to Kuchma, I can predict that Kravchuk will 
receive 47 percent of votes, Kuchma -- 53 percent, or 35 percent 
and 33 percent of votes, respectively.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Skachko in the "Ukraine" column: </F>
"Voters Ready, in Crisis Situation, To Vote for Left-Wingers. 
Democrats Cannot Bring Themselves To Support an `Outsider'"] 
  [Text] The parliament paper HOLOS UKRAYINY, citing the 
Kievo-Mogilyansk Academy Sociology Department, has reported 
that, according to a random survey of 1,005 people conducted two 
weeks before elections in 24 regions of Ukraine and in the 
Republic of Crimea, President Leonid Kravchuk heads the 
popularity rating, polling 29 percent. He is followed by 
ex-Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma (23 percent), parliament speaker 
Aleksandr Moroz (9 percent), Market Reforms Center President 
Vladimir Lanovoy (6 percent), parliament ex-speaker Ivan 
Plyushch (4 percent), banker Valeriy Babich (0.8 percent), and 
Education Minister Petr Talanchuk (0.3 percent). Twelve percent 
of the respondents intend to vote against all candidates, and 
another 16 percent have not yet made up their minds. 
  According to the poll, 76 percent of the respondents are 
going to take part in the presidential elections, 14 percent 
will not go to the polls, and 10 percent are not sure yet. The 
highest turnout is expected in western Ukraine --84 percent -- 
and the lowest in the east: 70 percent. 
  At the same time it looks as though Ukrainian citizens' high 
pre-election activity may well produce an imminent political 
power crisis because, first, the voters still do not know what 
the powers of the person they elect will be. Second, in this 
situation the main aspirants to the top post in the country are 
people from the old set: Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, 
who, thanks to their mutual efforts, appear in the eyes of the 
electorate in the case of the former as a symbol of stagnation 
and a near-criminal, do-nothing record in the state domain, and 
in the case of the latter as a symbol of Ukraine's pro-Russian 
orientation and gradual loss of political independence. 
Indicative in this respect are the results of another survey 
conducted in late May-early June by the Democratic Initiatives 
Center among 1,807 Ukraine citizens. Asked whether there are 
political leaders in Ukraine capable of running the country 
efficiently, 25 percent of respondents said that there are no 
such people; 56 percent do not know of such; and only 19 percent 
are sure that such leaders exist. Questioned about the role and 
powers of a future Ukrainian president, 53 percent of the 
respondents said the president should be the head of government 
and assume full responsibility for domestic and foreign policy, 
as in the United States. Some 25 percent were not sure, and 10 
percent said that Ukraine's president, as in France, should 
share power and responsibility with a prime minister approved by 
parliament. Another 7 percent said the president should be 
merely the head of state, a symbol of the nation without powers, 
which should, as in Italy and the FRG, be vested with the prime 
minister elected by parliament. Only 5 percent said that 
Ukraine does not need a president at all. Sociologists 
concluded that people want not so much new as efficient 
presidential power and that obvious preference is given to a 
strong presidential republic. However, this is something the 
upcoming presidential elections do not promise. 
  Moreover, after Vitaliy Masol's comeback to the political 
stage, the ideals of radical political and economic reforms have 
been jeopardized and the political situation has deteriorated 
because in one of his first public interviews the new prime 
minister stated that he wants to head the executive branch and 
is ready to assume full responsibility. It is quite possible 
that the left-wing parliamentary majority, in deciding the 
problems of power delimitation and having no president "of its 
own," will heed this wish and give him full executive powers. 
It is very difficult to do this today because this calls for a 
majority of parliamentarians' votes to change the current 
constitution and the left-wingers have no such majority. 
According to some observers, the leftists are in no hurry to 
share out powers because they are waiting for the results of the 
presidential elections and by-elections of 112 Ukrainian 
people's deputies, which may bring the required number of 
supporters. This plan is not totally groundless also because, 
according to the above-mentioned poll by the Democratic 
Initiatives Center, 21 percent of respondents said that at 
present they share communist and socialist ideas, whereas in 
April 1992 only 6 percent openly sympathized with this platform. 
Sociologists conclude that the orthodox left has substantially 
consolidated its positions in the last two years. If, 
sociologists say, "in the very near future there are no basic 
changes in living standards, this trend will grow," and 
therefore the leftists will win over at least another one-third 
of the politically aware population. The parliamentary 
by-elections on 24 July this year will show whether the 
communist renaissance in Ukraine will be complete. If the 
leftists manage to get through their candidates and obtain a 
stable majority in parliament, they will be able not only to 
change any constitutional norm but also adopt a new constitution 
which will include provisions beneficial to them. 
  The democrats so far are maintaining a wait-and-see 
position. 
In particular, the Ukrainian Rukh leadership has stated that 
this organization will not support anybody in the first round of 
voting and in the second round it will possibly support the 
reformist Vladimir Lanovoy. Statements by other democratic 
leaders make it clear that they cannot move away from the set of 
well-known political figures and support a new person or at 
least boycott the presidential elections, thus wrecking them and 
automatically extending the powers of incumbent President Leonid 
Kravchuk, whom many democrats see as "a lesser evil compared to 
the other candidates."

<F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Zhdannikov under the "Ukraine" rubric: </F>
"Another Encroachment on Presidential Powers. Supreme Council 
Wants To Protect Cabinet From Extraneous Influence"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Council is soon going to amend 
the law on the president, INTERFAX' Kiev correspondents report. 
The proposed amendments reserve for the president only the 
functions of head of state, denying him control of the cabinet. 
  Thus parliament is determined to turn the president into 
rather a symbolic figure not vested with any serious powers. 
Incidentally, this is not the first "campaign" by the 
republic's Supreme Council against -- in this case -- the powers 
of Mr. Kravchuk. The first one was several months ago and ended 
quite successfully for the Supreme Council. The objective at 
that time was to eliminate the system of presidential 
representatives in the regions, and it was then that Leonid 
Kravchuk stated he would not run unless the law was revised 
since he had no intention of becoming a toy in the hands of 
various political groups. 
  Early in May, however, with the question of Mr. Kravchuk's 
participation in the elections still undecided, the time factor, 
so to speak, came into operation and all the current president's 
opponents stated with one accord that they saw no reasons for 
bringing the 26 June event forward while there was no time left 
to review the law. Realizing he had no way out and that the 
elections could just as well proceed without him, Kravchuk had 
to join the presidential race, deferring until better times the 
hopes of having his representatives in the regions. 
  And there came a blow beneath the belt, so to speak. Hoping 
that few people would pay attention to what are generally 
radical amendments in the law one week before the voting, the 
Supreme Council is going to strip him of control over the 
executive branch. Kravchuk may be no economic figure. Indeed, 
he is not. Still he has every right to accuse the Supreme 
Council of ingratitude: It was he who proposed, a week ago, the 
compromise figure of Vitaliy Masol for the position of prime 
minister. Precisely in order to avoid yet another 
president-parliament crisis. 
  It may of course be supposed that, in getting ready to amend 
the law, the Supreme Council is simply out to protect Masol, 
whom it is quite happy about, against attacks by a new 
president. What if he happens to be, say, not Kravchuk but 
Kuchma, whose entire election program consists solidly of 
economic slogans? He would certainly keep a big drawer in the 
presidential desk for his ideas for laws concerning the economy. 
  There is just one "but." Given its present composition, 
parliament would be hard pressed to amend the Constitution. It 
requires at least 300 votes. At the moment the powers of only 
336 deputies out of the requisite 450 have been confirmed.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Responding to a 
request by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the Ukrainian 
presidential edict on urgent measures to return to Ukraine hard 
currency valuables that are illegally held abroad and on the 
fight against speculation, Oleksandr Suhonyako, president of the 
Association of Ukrainian banks, said on 22 June: "This edict is 
a great deal more significant for the president's pre-election 
fight than for the economy. People who have hard currency are 
not so naive as to obey the edict and return the hard currency 
to Ukraine. This is an issue that confronts us all today. At 
present, according to various facts, there is up to $20 billion 
that belongs to Ukraine. No edict will be able to return these 
funds. They will be returned on the condition that those who 
own the funds receive guarantees that the capital will remain 
theirs. There should be a state guarantee that nobody will take 
an interest in how the owners obtained these funds. If we give 
such a guarantee then the money will be made to work for us. If 
we attempt to find out whether the money is dirty, gray, or 
white then we will do so until the end of the world." 
  In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Vasyl Durdynets, 
first deputy chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the 
Fight Against Corruption and Organized Crime noted that the 
aforementioned edict of the Ukrainian president "is of a 
principled significance for our state." He noted the importance 
of setting up concrete time-limits, both for declaring hard 
currency valuables that are held abroad (10 days) and for 
transferring them to Ukraine (one month). Durdynets stressed 
the importance of the fact that if the regulations of the edict 
in respect of businesses are carried out then sanctions will not 
be applied and their directors and officials will not be brought 
to book. "This edict gives law breakers the possibility to 
atone for their sins and to fulfill their duties toward the 
state," noted Durdynets, adding that if the regulations are 
ignored other legal norms and laws would come into effect and he 
gave assurances that the law enforcement bodies would then act 
more decisively. 
  With regard to the edict of the Ukrainian president on the 
fight against speculation, Durdynets gave assurances that the 
coordinating committee -- of which he is chairman -- that will 
supervise the implementation of this, will conduct steadfast 
supervision over the implementation of all its provisions. "I 
want Ukrainian citizens to understand that our actions are 
directed at protecting their rights as consumers," noted 
Durdynets.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 22 June carries a 10-minute recorded 
report by correspondent Tamara Kucherenko on a meeting on 22 
June between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and the 
leadership of Ukraine's "power ministries and agencies." 
According to Kucherenko, the meeting focused on "the protection 
and security of a human being" as a new conceptual problem for 
Ukraine. 
  Kucherenko quotes Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Yuriy 
Kravchenko as saying that, although no drastic increase in 
criminal activity occurred in Ukraine and there was even a 
tendency toward a declining crime rate, the one phenomenon that 
was "acquiring a bloody character" was contract killing with the 
use of firearms--the number of which has increased three-fold. 
Kucherenko says that the situation was particularly serious in 
Crimea and that, according to Kravchenko, even while the rate of 
crime detection has risen by 14 percent, the murder of 
militiamen has become more frequent, and a disproportionately 
small number of criminals have been convicted for this crime. 
  Kucherenko says that both Ukrainian Justice Minister Vasyl 
Onopenko and Security Service chief Yevhen Marchuk criticized 
Ukraine's criminal law and insisted that, in particular, the law 
should be amended to apply the death penalty for the murder of 
militiamen. 
  Kucherenko then quotes Viktor Medvedchuk, president of 
Ukraine's Lawyers Union, as saying that 25,000 people had 
disappeared in Ukraine in 1993. 
  Kucherenko also describes Procurator General Vladyslav 
Datsyuk's address to the meeting as "quite expressive." 
According to Kucherenko, Datsyuk says: What we have is 
arbitrariness, rather than law; he says that there are delays in 
the handling of cases by the courts, isolation cells are 
overcrowded, people are taking turns sleeping, and there is not 
enough food for them. Datsyuk is quoted as saying that, at the 
same time, some "leading Mafiosi have now become real dollar 
millionaires." 
  Kucherenko reports on President Kravchuk's address to the 
meeting and follows with a recording of Kravchuk's remarks. 
  Kravchuk says: "Today we can say that our citizens--the 
citizens of Ukraine, the citizens of the state that exists, that 
is in the making--are not protected in full measure and cannot 
exercise their vital human rights and freedoms in full measure. 
I believe this is true. When we are talking about all those 
things that have been mentioned here today, however, we proceed 
from the basic principle that the life of an individual is 
secure. That is to say, there is peace, accord, and there are 
no encroachments on the most valuable thing--life. 
  "On the one hand, we see the existing difficulties; on the 
other hand, we see that there is a possibility for an individual 
to feel he is not in a state of emergency. Many other such 
examples could be mentioned. However, I agree with what has 
been said here. This was said by the chief of the Security 
Service and by Vladyslav Datsyuk [word indistinct]. It is clear 
that the challenge has been launched, and now we cannot evade 
this. We have to respond to war with war. We should not be 
afraid of this terminology. That is to say, I formulate [word 
indistinct] as follows: not a state of emergency, but emergency 
measures to fight the criminal world--emergency measures built 
on law, on enforceable enactments. 
  "This is why it is necessary to urgently submit such a 
package of documents--for example, on the initiative of the 
president--at least so they can be considered as soon as 
possible by the Supreme Council. However, we should immediately 
do what we can do on the basis of the already existing laws and 
the existing decrees. This includes both preventive detentions 
and the genuine protection, first and foremost, of employees of 
law enforcement bodies and other individuals who perform 
protective functions under the law. 
  "This does not mean that we will encroach on some rights and 
freedoms of either an individual or groups of individuals while 
taking emergency measures. We will protect the rights and 
freedoms of the largest, the most representative, group of 
people who suffer as a result of impudence, armed attacks, and 
just [word indistinct] cruelty on the part of various wild--I 
say this without any exaggeration--formations and criminal 
groups. I believe we have the grounds to do it exactly this 
way." 
  Kucherenko then reports that Kravchuk also reminded the 
meeting it became possible to prevent reprisals against the 
Communist Party and some of its leaders after the abortive 
August putsch of 1991 in Moscow. She reports that Kravchuk said 
that threats can be heard today from left-wing forces wishing to 
square accounts with their opponents, and they speak openly 
about concentration camps and crematoria. Kravchuk says very 
little is required to return to those times.

<F P=106> [By Konstantin Borodin: "Vitaliy Masol -- New-Old Premier of </F>
Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Vitaliy Masol has been elected the premier of 
Ukraine. 199 MP's voted for his candidature. 24 were against. 
Such result was a surprise for 78 MP's who abstained (27 
members of Rukh faction, 27 MP's from the group "Reforms", 26 
members of faction "Statehood"). 
  One day before the voting, those MP's were quite optimistic 
since the faction "Unity" (26 MP's) and faction "Center" were 
against elections of the premier. Les Tanyuk, MP representing 
Rukh, predicted that only 140 MP's, representing communists, 
socialists and agrarians, would vote for Masol. Leader of the 
democratic party V. Yavorivskyy stated that at least half of the 
faction "Center" would be against the candidature of Mr. Masol. 
Quite unexpectedly, there was a split among the left-wingers -- 
parliamentarians from Donetsk region tended to back the 
candidature of Lazarenko. 
  However, Speaker Moroz proposed to postpone the election 
till 
next day. It is hard to say what kind of changes occurred 
within one night but, be that as it may, the left-wingers formed 
common opinion and pursued quite a few MP's from factions 
"Unity" and "Center" to vote for Masol. Thus, V. Masol, former 
head of the state planning committee and the premier of Ukraine 
in 1987-1990 again was elected to this high post. 
  Almost 4 years ago, the students went on hunger strike and 
made him resign on the 17th day of that strike. In October of 
1990, this man was a symbol of a rotten communist system. 
However, the authorities did not fulfill other demands of 
students. Rumors have it that in the last 4 years Mr. Masol 
headed a company having a lot of offices abroad. His son is 
manager of "Rostok" company producing kitchen equipment. The 
company is profitable and popular among consumers. 
  Ex-Premier Y. Zvyagilskyy said that he had voted for Masol 
because the latter is good specialist and businessman who would 
stick to the policy of economic stabilization. Speaker Moroz 
told our correspondent that the Cabinet would undergo 
considerable changes. Says Mr. Moroz: "Nobody should complain 
that Mr. Masol is procommunist. First and foremost, he is a 
professional". According to leader of communists V.Symonenko, 
Masol meets the interests of not only the party of communists 
but the people of Ukraine as a whole. 
  One communist parliamentarian told that there had been 
heated 
debates among communists concerning Masol's candidature. He 
says that the fact that communists backed him was the compromise 
with centrists. Many communists did not like his address to the 
parliament in which he underscored his adherence to market 
reforms. Says famous economist V. Pylypchuk, member of faction 
"Reforms": Having heard his program, I understood that Mr. Masol 
had changed much. His program is 90 percent similar to mine. 
The main thing is that he should keep his promises". 
  Mr. Pylypchuk stressed the difference between economic 
programs of Masol and Speaker Moroz. The latter, however, 
stated prior to elections that the parliament and government 
would act in unison if Masol was elected the premier of Ukraine. 
According to Mr. Pylypchuk, it is good that left-wingers 
supported Masol since now they have no arguments in accusing the 
democrats of opposition. His opinion is shared by his 
colleagues from Rukh and "Reforms" factions. None of them is 
going to work in the Cabinet. 
  O. Yemets, the minister for the matters of nationalities in 
Zvyagilskyy's Cabinet, resigned on the next day after Masol was 
elected the premier. He believes that the government will be 
procommunist one and rejects any idea of formation of coalition 
cabinet. It seems that new premier likes such state of affairs. 
In particular, he states that his Cabinet would consist of 
professionals having no political sentiments. It was President 
Kravchuk who nominated Masol to the premier's post. This was 
done after parliamentary commissions considered the list of 
candidates including Y.Zvyagilskyy, leader of liberals I. 
Merkulov, former Vice Premier V.Symonenko, representative of 
Dnipropetrovsk nomenklatura V.Lazarenko, plant director V. 
Melnyk and V. Masol. 
  O. Zayets, secretary of Rukh faction, thinks that Masol's 
candidature was the best of them all but believes that the 
Premier had to be elected from "new people". Thus the victory 
of left-wingers at parliamentary elections was supported by 
appointing of the most odious person (for their opponents) to 
the premier's post. It seems improbable that the coalition 
government will be formed since democrats reject any idea to 
work in the cabinet. Still, Mr. Masol may cooperate with 
Pynzenyk and Lanovyy to partially implement their programs. It 
is worth underscoring that the victory of left-wingers can 
neutralize separatist sentiments in southern and eastern regions 
of Ukraine.

  [Text] Ivan Yermakov, one of the major candidates to be 
chairman of the Sevastopol City Council and former envoy of the 
Ukrainian president in this city, accused Kiev "of striving to 
cancel or torpedo the elections to the local power bodies." 
Commenting the latest changes in provisions for the elections in 
his interview with INTERFAX, he said that Ukraine's leadership 
"tries to buy time by any means in order to introduce something 
else after the presidential elections in Ukraine and to prevent 
elections of strong leaders in the region. Such leaders present 
obstacles to Kiev." 
  On June 16 Ukraine's parliament adopted an amendment to the 
decree on the elections to local power bodies which stipulates 
that a candidate who collects more than 25 percent of the votes 
will be considered elected. Earlier it was enough to collect 
more than 10 percent. 
  In Yermakov's opinion, this decision "disperses the 
electors' 
votes." He stressed that earlier voter turnout did not exceed 
50 percent and now "it will be difficult to gather people to the 
elections during the period of summer vacations, especially for 
a repeated round of voting." 
  "The necessary 25 percent to win actually represents half of 
those who will come to vote. Meanwhile, as many as 11 people 
are on the list of candidates," Yermakov declared. 
  Yermakov, who is also chairman of the Union of Prosperity In 
Unity invited all candidates to negotiate so that everyone would 
receive a deserved place in the team and would stand in the 
common row for cooperation for the sake of the city's 
well-being." 
  "If we do not make these steps together, then an envoy 
appointed by another Kravchuk from Kiev will guide the city," 
Yermakov declared. 
  According to Sevastopol's state administration, a total of 
34.7 percent of the Sevastopol residents intend to vote for 
Yermakov; Alexander Penkin, second in command of the Black Sea 
Fleet -- 13.1 percent; and former commander of the Black Sea 
Fleet Aleksey Penkin -- 10.1 percent.

  [Text] Sevastopol, [no dateline as received] -- On 22 June 
the SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA newspaper published an appeal by Viktor 
Semenov, the chairman of the town council on the deployment in 
the town "without prior warning and in the absence of any need 
of Ukrainian National Guard battalions." "Every sober- minded 
person understands, states the appeal, that the deployment of 
subunits of Ukraine's National Guard on the eve of presidential 
elections, the election of the chairman and deputies of oblast 
and rayon councils, and an opinion poll of citizens on the 
status of Sevastopol at a time when the talks with the Russian 
Federation on the issues of the Black Sea Fleet are entering a 
decisive phase, is a previously planned political act aimed at 
frightening the residents of Sevastopol. 
  A protest by Ukraine's deputy procurator general against the 
holding of the opinion poll among the town's residents, which 
was recently received by the town council, also serves to 
confirm such a conclusion. 
  Semenov considers that a decision by the town council to 
demand that the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council, 
and Ukraine's defense minister review the decision to deploy 
Ukrainian national guard battalions in the town, that they 
return them to their former place of deployment as soon as 
possible, and also that Ukraine's procurator general withdraws 
the protest by his deputy are legitimate.

  [Text] Kiev -- In the past few days army units and 
establishments within Ukraine's Ministry of Defense received an 
order by Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukrainian defense 
minister, that introduces "regulations on penal battalions in 
Ukraine's Armed Forces." It sets out the procedure and 
conditions for punishing compulsory service soldiers and also 
defines the procedure for the penal battalion's activity. 
  The regulations provide for the commander of the penal 
battalion to be appointed personally by the Ukrainian defense 
minister and determine that the military district commander is 
directly responsible for its leadership. 
  According to the resolution, the duration of service of 
officers in the penal battalion should not exceed five-six years 
for a battalion commander and 3-4 for other posts. 
  Today, there are two penal battalions in the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine: in Kiev's Darnitskiy Rayon and in Chernomorskiy 
settlement in Crimea.

<F P=106> [Report by Grigoriy Kolodin: "In a Civilized and Humane </F>
Manner. This Is How Turkmenistan and Russia Are Resolving 
Questions of Dual Citizenship and Migration"] 
  [Text] Turkmenistan -- When, during a one-day visit to 
Ashgabat on the eve of the December meeting of Commonwealth 
heads of state, Boris Yeltsin and Saparmurad Niyazov signed an 
agreement on dual citizenship and regulation of the process of 
migration, the majority of their CIS counterparts perceived this 
event as unexpected and partly sensational. After all, the 
attitude of the leaders of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, for 
instance, toward the institution of dual citizenship is well 
known. They consider it unsuitable for the countries and 
peoples they head, one citing a possible decline of patriotism, 
and the other classifying the... indigenous population as 
Russian-speakers. Let me say straight away that a couple of 
years ago even President S. Niyazov, to put it mildly, was not a 
particularly ardent supporter of concluding a treaty on dual 
citizenship with anybody. However, in making a decisive 
contribution to the preparation and conclusion of the 
agreements, creating for the first time in nearby foreign 
countries a civilized legal basis for the status of Russians 
permanently resident on Turkmenistan's territory, and having 
advocated the states' responsibility as regards the fate of 
migrants, the Turkmen leader has proved yet again that uppermost 
in his mind is not personal ambition, but the interests of 
actual people. 
  After all, the life and status of Slavs in Turkmenistan were 
and remain perhaps by far the most propitious among the millions 
of their compatriots who overnight became foreigners in their 
own homes after the great power's collapse. One of the very 
first laws adopted by the parliament of the now independent 
state proclaimed that the incitement of interethnic strife and 
the infringement of citizens' rights on the grounds of their 
belonging to a different nation or religion is a crime of the 
utmost severity. But, of course, this is not just a matter of 
lawmaking: The main point is that, through the tangible actions 
of the leadership in this difficult transition period, public 
accord and calm were successfully preserved here, and the 
honoring of social guarantees for all categories of citizens 
without exception was ensured. The exceptionally good 
relations, which have developed on the new basis of sovereignty 
with greater Russia have played a far from insignificant role. 
  "Good relations are a remarkable thing," V. Cherepov, the 
Russian Federation's ambassador in Turkmenistan, told me. "But 
in proclaiming the aspiration to occupy a worthy place in the 
ranks of civilized states, we must switch all problems to a 
lawful channel. I agree that Russians here are somewhat better 
off than even our compatriots in the majority of Russia's 
regions. But nevertheless, just look at how many problems 
emerge when a family breaks up. Here, a vast unified country has 
collapsed, customs posts have been erected, national currencies 
have been introduced, and today, at times, people do not even 
get the chance to bury close relatives who have died in another, 
now also independent, republic. Look at the burden of migrants. 
Let me point out that the process of the migration of Russians 
from Turkmenistan is not a new phenomenon -- it has been going 
on since the 1970's. But whereas at that time migration could 
be compared with a couple of small fires, nowadays it is more 
like a universal catastrophe, the reasons for which do not need 
to be spelled out to anybody, I think." 
  Every day, from early morning, a small crowd of people 
gather 
by the gates of the Russian Embassy. Similar things, no doubt, 
can be seen at the Russian Federation missions in many other 
former fraternal republics. The difference is that, although 
Russians in the Baltic Region are asking for assistance to 
regain civil rights and those in Dushanbe and Tbilisi are 
begging for help to escape "to anywhere," here in Ashgabat 
people are coming to find out when they will be able to apply 
for dual citizenship, and which rights and opportunities it 
offers them.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 22 Jun -- Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of 
the Georgian state, has received Vladimir Zemskoy, Russia's 
ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Georgia, at the 
latter's request. 
  The Russian ambassador handed the head of state a letter 
from 
the Russian Federation president in which Boris Yeltsin 
expresses profound confidence that friendship and cooperation 
between Russia and Georgia will continue for the benefit of our 
states. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze and Ambassador Zemskoy discussed the 
decision to introduce Russian peacekeeping forces into the 
Abkhazian conflict zone. This decision was adopted by the 
Russian Federation Council. The head of state noted that he 
attaches particular significance to this decision. In his 
opinion, this international move by Russia is of historic 
significance, not only for Georgia. The success of this move 
may serve to guarantee stability in Transcaucasia. In that 
event, Russia's prestige in the world will grow considerably, 
because the responsibility taken by an individual country in 
cooperation with an international organization for such a 
serious move acquires the power of positive example for other 
countries.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Boris Yeltsin today 
said a firm "no" to the ITAR-TASS correspondent's question about 
whether the president intends to suspend the edict on fighting 
banditry after the State Duma so recommended. 
  At the same time, in the words of Vyacheslav Kostikov, the 
head of state's press secretary, the Russian president well 
realizes that "there is a question" about violation of human 
rights in the edict. That is why Boris Yeltsin 22 June sent a 
letter to Sergey Kovalev, the Russian federation's 
plenipotentiary for human rights, instructing him to supervise 
implementation of the edict on protecting the population from 
organized crime and promising his personal support in this. 
  In turn, Sergey Filatov, head of the russian president's 
administration, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent: "We do not 
intend to blindly follow the letter of the document, for it is 
not a dogma. If we see that citizens' rights are being flouted 
on the basis of the edict, we shall think about adjusting it."

<F P=106> [Report by Inna Petrova under the "Arms Trade" rubric: </F>
"Russian Arms Manufacturers Are Afraid To Approach the World 
Market with an Assault Rifle"] 
  [Text] Vladimir -- The international exhibition "Russia's 
Armament and Military Hardware," organized for the fourth time 
by the "Zolotyye Vorota Rusi" Joint-Stock Company in conjunction 
with the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, has ended its work in 
Vladimir. 
  According to specialists, it was a success and to some 
extent 
will enable Russian enterprises engaged in producing small arms 
and hand-held artillery to improve their economic position. Not 
at once, it is true. It will take quite some time for the new 
models of weapons, military gear, and optics which were 
exhibited -- and most of which are unparalleled in the world -- 
to find rich buyers. Although representatives of over 30 
foreign firms, governments, ministries of defense, and other 
departments visited the exhibition, experience of similar events 
in the past shows that business offers should be expected later, 
when foreign businessmen and experts have analyzed all the 
information obtained. 
  Our arms manufacturers are preparing to work in new 
conditions: The government's May decree gives manufacturing 
enterprises the right to engage in autonomous foreign economic 
activity. But will this accelerate sales of output which has 
accumulated in plants? Will the autonomy that has been granted 
not remain imaginary? Are the producers themselves ready for 
such free floating? 
  Here are the views of professionals, which I have heard. 
  Nikolay Kovalchuk, general director of the "Zavod imeni V. 
Degtyareva" Joint-Stock Company, city of Kovrov: 
  "Since we will be permitted to obtain a license and to trade 
in weapons, then, technologically, we must have our own pricing 
specialists, market analysts, and traveling salesmen. 
  "Quite a long time will pass while they are making the 
acquaintance of potential buyers and finding out who is behind 
whom and with which grouping or which shaykh it makes sense to 
talk and with which it does not. But what will be the good of a 
sale several years later? Maybe, while earning dollars today, 
tomorrow we will start losing them -- in hundreds and thousands? 
I believe that the process might drag on. Therefore we must 
use structures which have experience of the arms trade and with 
which we have long-standing ties." 
  Vladimir Pankov, leading engineer of a machine-building 
design bureau, city of Kolomna: 
  "While you are agreeing all the parameters of contracts with 
many official organs, the client simply loses patience. The 
time it takes to register jobs is approximately doubled. 
Frequently there is also unjustified interference in prices. 
  "There is a fear that, just as we `ate our way' through 
petrodollars in the past, so now we might lose dollars from 
sales of at least that section of weapons in which we are 
permitted to trade. They will be 'eaten' precisely by the 
intermediate structures." 
  Yuriy Sergeyev, chief of a department of Tula Instrument 
Making Design Bureau: 
  "There was, is, and will be a monopoly of the arms trade. If 
the `Rosvooruzheniye' State Company conducts talks with our 
participation, we will not be selling too cheaply, as the saying 
goes. But if it does so without us, then the features of our 
output are not always correctly highlighted. It happens that a 
single model of a weapon is sold, and not at a high price 
either. It turns out that it has been sold for 
cognitive-intelligence purposes. We lose our potential and give 
up our product for nothing. 
  "We are not adversaries or rivals of the `Rosvooruzheniye' 
State Company. We must work alongside it in studying world 
experience of the arms trade and engage in marketing research so 
as to get a result." 
  Mikhail Zakharov, vice president of the "Spetsialnoye 
Mashinostroyeniye i Metallurgiya" Joint-Stock Company and in the 
recent past deputy minister of the defense industry, who now 
tackles questions of the arms trade: 
  "In the past the people of Tula were granted autonomy, and 
nothing came of that. The decree elicited in me a dual feeling. 
What was the point of it, if it ran counter to previously issued 
documents, particularly the president's edict on setting up the 
`Rosvooruzheniye' State Company as a monopoly organization? It 
essentially does not give enterprises sufficient rights for 
autonomous trade in weapons. In addition, very many competing 
organizations from Russia will appear on the market -- which 
will not produce positive results. It is said that they do not 
let us onto the market. But we ourselves have not yet learned 
how to trade." 
  The position of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company itself 
was presented by Aleksandr Semenov, deputy chief of the regional 
policy administration. In his opinion, the decree's publication 
certainly does not mean that tomorrow all enterprises will run 
to conquer the foreign market with their output. The right to 
participate in military-technical cooperation with foreign 
countries is granted them only if certain conditions are 
observed. It is necessary, among other things, to undergo 
two-level certification and registration. The commission on 
foreign economic cooperation, which will be headed by First Vice 
Premier O. Soskovets, will have the final say. 
  Thus, the question of whether there is a monopoly of the 
arms 
trade in Russia remains open.

  [Text] Tiraspol, BASAPRESS, 17/6/1994 -- The negotiations 
between Dniester and Moldovan sides are temporarily suspended; 
the Chisinau officials made a break "to calm the passions" after 
different political forces criticized the signing of the 
Snegur-Smirnov declaration, stated yesterday Valeri Litskai, 
state secretary of the self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, on 
Asket TV in Tiraspol. In his opinion, other reasons for this 
suspension would include the fact that Chisinau is preoccupied 
with the settlement of the Gagauz problem and that the results 
of the presidential elections in the Ukraine are awaited. 
Litskai declared that Moldova speculates on Dniester's 
financial difficulties. Dniester cannot obtain from Russia the 
coupons printed there, thus causing an acute crisis of cash. 
According to him, Russia declared that it would send the 
coupons to Tiraspol when an agreement between Chisinau and 
Dniester leaders is signed. Litskai pointed out that the 
Tiraspol leadership insisted for three weeks that Snegur meet 
Smirnov, but it received no answer. He said that nevertheless, 
the prospects of settling the conflict are favorable and gave as 
example the signing of an agreement between Russia and 
Tatarstan. According to him, the contribution of Russian and 
CSCE mission mediators to the settlement of the conflict has 
been substantial and constructive. Nevertheless, Moldova will be 
a potential enemy for Dniester, as it fortifies its armed forces 
and refuses to demilitarize, stated Litskai.

constitutional right of veto against the law on the formation of 
local bodies of power and self-government which was recently 
passed by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The president has 
referred the law to the parliament for amendment. He announced 
this on Wednesday during a meeting with ministers and heads of

some articles of the law contradict the constitution and the 
current legislation.

  [Text] Yerevan ("YERKIR" daily--HAYLUR), 06/22/94--Russian 
Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir Stupishin said, status of the RMK 
[Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] is to be defined within the 
framework of international negotiations and should be 
advantageous for the Artsakh people, giving them real security 
guarantees. 
  During an interview with Acting Editor in Chief of "MK 
[Mountainous Karabakh] Republic" newspaper G. Bagdasaryan on 
June 18, he related recognition of Mountainous Karabakh by 
Russia with a corresponding decision by Armenia. 
  According to Stupishin, the relations between Armenia and 
Russia are direct and are based on their independence. The 
relations with the RMK are dependent on international 
recognition of the latter.

  [Text] The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army Headquarters 
reports that the situation on the Karabakh front line has not 
changed. there were no serious incidents over the past day. 
However, Azerbaijan's military forces fired on the Armenian 
defense positions with various types of arms from time to time. 
The Armenian side refrained from returning the fire. 
  No serious incidents occurred on the border between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan during the past day. The situation is relatively 
peaceful. However, it is difficult to predict how long the 
peaceful situation will continue. Everything depends on 
Azerbaijan. As a rule, Azerbaijan's aggressive operations cause 
serious incidents in the region. The Armenian side continues to 
heed the cease-fire agreement along the border.

<F P=106> [Article by Artem Yerkanyan: "I Came, I Saw, I Signed. On </F>
General Grachev's Visit to the Transcaucasus"] 
  [Text] Russia has no intention of conceding the 
Transcaucasus to anyone. The latest confirmation of this 
obvious fact was the last visit to the region by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, which demonstrated the seriousness of 
Moscow's intentions. Was the Kremlin satisfied with the results 
of the Caucasian voyage of the chief of the military department? 
Most likely it was, although the Russian general was not 
received in all the Caucasian capitals with the courtesy to 
which he had every right to lay claim. 
  There was no doubt that Grachev would not have any problems 
in Yerevan. The question of deploying a contingent of the 
Russian Army on the territory of Armenia was decided long before 
the ceremony for signing the corresponding agreement, the 
conclusion of which, incidentally, was welcomed by all political 
groups of the republic without exception. The reaction to the 
agreement on Russia's military presence in Georgia was, of 
course, not as unambiguous. And there were even quite 
contradictory stories about the expediency, admissibility, and 
correctness of the participation of Russian peacekeeping forces 
in the resolution of the Abkhazian conflict stipulated in the 
document that was signed in Tbilisi with the approval of the 
Abkhazian and Georgian parliaments. 
  It is most difficult of all to assess the results of the 
negotiations in Baku, since the meeting of the Russian minister 
with the president of Azerbaijan took place behind closed doors, 
and it is hardly a good idea to believe the information that 
leaks through them. Both parties are trying to convince the 
mass media that the future of the Gabarlinskaya radar station 
was the main subject of discussion at the meeting. And this 
means that so far no definite success has been achieved in the 
question of reaching agreement about the Russian plan for 
regulating the Abkhazian conflict. There is no reason to expect 
that Azerbaijan will give way on its positions, since Geydar 
Aliyev had just returned from Istanbul at that time. The 
meetings on the Turkish land, of course, reinforced the 
Azerbaijani leader's belief in the "correctness of the chosen 
path." At the same time Aliyev had nothing with which to 
counter the persistence of the Kremlin emissary, as a result of 
which, official Baku, judging from everything, has recognized 
the inevitability of conceding to the Russian military the right 
to "be in charge" at the Gabarlinskaya radar station. The final 
"i" will be dotted during the visit of the Azerbaijani defense 
minister to Moscow, which was recently arranged for an 
unspecified date. Then one can expect a more definite response 
from Azerbaijan to the Russian peace initiative.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 24 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
newspaper describes today "sensational" proposals to extend the 
term of powers of Russian legislators by another two years as a 
sudden development in political events. 
  Most different opinions are expressed on this development in 
various quarters, including legislators. 
  Examining favourable arguments, the newspaper notes that any 
new elections will whip up a powerful wave of political 
struggle. The interests of the economy, production and the 
social sphere will again fall victim of politicis. 
  Besides, new positive elements have appeared now: The public 
accord treaty was signed, and it was possible to stabilise 
inflationary processes. 
  The president issued several important economic decrees and 
announced emergency measures to fight organised crime. All 
these raise confidence in authorities. The newspaper also quotes 
arguments "against": the very idea of extending legislators' 
powers needs amendments to the constitution, and this is 
possible only through a new nation-wide referendum during which 
passions will fly high. 
  "It is impossible to deny that the very idea of Eurasia 
symbolises that the nations of today's so-called post-Soviet 
space have common destinies," chairman of the Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord Sergey Shakhray says in an interview with the 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper today. 
  "It is possible that public opinion will adopt another 
integration ideology. This is a question open for discussion. 
However, it is clear now that the Eurasian idea, as it was the 
case in the past, again became a banner of a very difficult 
`transition' period. This idea reminds, for the umpteenth time, 
our peoples of `their will for a common cause' awakening at the 
most difficult times of history. 
  The same newspaper features an article by Aleksey Arbatov, 
D.Sc. (history), who writes: "The top priority of the Russian 
foreign policy is to promote independence and stability of new 
neighbouring states as well as the development of good relations 
with them on an individual basis. 
  "If this is too expensive, we should invite to such a 
strategy other foreign countries in the framework of a new broad 
system of multilateral cooperation and security." 
  The TRUD newspaper pays attention to economic problems. "the 
Russian economy has set a record," the newspaper writes. 
"However, we do not hear loud commentaries, let alone fanfares. 
  "The record, as it is, is very significant: Russia reached 
the lowest level of inflation in may for the first time in two 
and a half years of reforms -- 6.9 per cent. It is the lowest 
in the past 30 months since november of the pre-reform year of 
1991. 
  "But the government is in no hurry to receive 
congratulations. Firstly, there is no confidence that prices 
will not start rise again in July. Secondly, and this is the 
main thing, the drop in inflation was achieved by an exorbitant 
price: Industrial production continues to fall, and this 
nation-wide fall is assuming more disquieting and dangerous 
nature." 
  Commenting on the president's decree on urgent measures to 
protect population from banditry and other manifestations of 
organised crime, the NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA notes: "The 
president's decree means nothing but emergency measures: Bandit 
groups appeared not recently, while the criminal code written 
long ago has article 77 entitled `banditry' providing for most 
strict punishment. However, nothing is heard about cases under 
this article, let alone court sentences...". 
  The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper carries an interview with 
former Ukrainian Premier Leonid Kuchma touching on the problem 
of the Crimea. 
  "Many try to show the Crimea's desire for independence as a 
result of the activities of pro-Russian political forces in the 
region," he writes. "Sure, there are such forces. But it would 
be inadmissible simplification to limit this problem only to 
these activities. 
  "The general and presidential elections in the Crimea showed 
that the majority of population supports the present policy of 
the Crimean leadership and its desire for independent solution 
of problems. 
  "I'm deeply convinced that tension around the peninsula is 
linked with the general crisis in Ukraine. We should frankly 
and with criticism point to two main factors estranging the 
Crimea from Ukraine. 
  "The first is self-destruction of the Ukrainian economy. The 
second factor is politics. If we do not switch to regional 
bilingual practice and do not stop national-radicalisation of 
historical science, arts and public education, we shall witness 
conflicts in other Ukrainian regions as well." 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper features an interview with 
Colonel- General Valeriy Patrikeyev, commander of the Collective 
Peace- Keeping Force (CPKF) in Tajikistan. 
  "Despite the emerging stabilisation of the situation in 
Tajikistan, I warn anybody that this will not prompt the CPKF to 
decrease its vigilance and combat preparedness. I assure all 
interested sides: This will not take place." 
  The last stage of building the Argus platform began under 
the 
Russian programme "Mars-1996". The SANKT PETERBURGSKIE 
VEDOMOSTI newspaper reports that its development involves the 
all-Russian transport engineering institute, the author of many 
modifications of planet buggies. 
  The platform will start operating when a station is put into 
an orbit of the Mars. The Argus is to direct equipment on 
definite points of the planet's surface, ensuring precise 
transmission of information. 
  The ROSSIYSKIE VESTI claims that chemist Tamara Svishcheva 
carried out sensational experiments at Russian institutes. They 
corroborated a parasitic theory of cancer's origin, which was 
developed by Professor M. Nevedomsky and which was defeated in 
the 1960s. 
  Its essence is that the formidable ailment is caused by 
one-cell parasites. It is they and not human cells that start 
avalanche multiplication in a weakened organism.

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--The discussion, started on 
Thursday, of the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures To 
Protect the Population From Banditry and Other Manifestations of 
Organised Crime", did not end with the adoption of any decision 
on Friday. None of four draft resolutions polled the necessary 
number of votes. Neither did the deputies support a proposal to 
form an editorial commission to work out a new document. 
  The Federation Council, according to the Constitution, may 
not turn down or endorse a presidential decree, Issa Kostoyev, 
chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional 
Legislation and Judicial Matters, told ITAR-TASS. But since 
Boris Yeltsin referred the document to the Federation Council, 
expressing hope that the upper house of parliament "will ensure 
the exercise of necessary measures to enact the decree in the 
regions and constitutent republics of the Federation", the 
deputies began to examine it, Kostoyev said. 
  The legislation committee, upon studying the decree, came 
forward with a draft resolution emphasising that "any measures 
to combat crime should be based on strict observance of Russia's 
Constitution and federal laws." 
  The draft resolution shares the president's concern and 
supports on the whole the resolute measures being taken by him 
to step up anti-crime fight. 
  At the same time the deputies "have to state that the decree 
contains a number of provisions that run counter to the 
Constitution and legislation," Kostoyev said. He believes that 
the contraditions are quite resolvable. "Therefore, in the draft 
resolution we suggested that the acting prosecutor-general 
"ensure strict observance of the rights and freedoms of 
citizens, the norms of the constitution and criminal procecude 
legislation". 
  In view of the fact that the deputies did not accept either 
this draft resolution or three other ones, Kostoyev recalled 
that, according to the Constitution, the presidential decree 
signed on June 14 is already in effect throughout the territory 
of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin: "Corps of Deputies: We Are </F>
Not Stokers or Carpenters, But We Are Continuously at Work"] 
  [Text] Surprisngly enough, the proposal by the speaker of 
parliament's upper chamber, Vladimir Shumeyko, to extend by a 
further two years the electoral term of the presidency and 
parliament did not provoke a stormy reaction in the lower 
chamber. 
  The Duma members are still in thought. Doctor of Juridical 
Sciences M. Mityukov, deputy chairman of the State Duma, did not 
conceal the fact: "I need to ponder it. I am not yet ready to 
give a response." 
  Gennadiy Burbulis was more candid: "I support the proposal. 
There is no point holding elections for their own sake. Society 
needs to develop a good structure over this time." 
  For whom, in fact, is a consensus at the highest levels an 
advantage? For many. For some, because all the possible 
nightmares, settling of scores, and squabbles which would 
inevitably be unleashed with a sudden change of power, recede 
into hazy oblivion. For others, it gives time to resolve their 
many personal problems. 
  There is no doubt that the majority of deputies will be 
privately and publicly in favor of extending their term of 
office. The only people to be unhappy will be the leaders of 
parties and movements who have already publicly stated that they 
will put themselves forward as presidential and parliamentary 
candidates. Konstantin Borovoy will patently curse. Rutskoy 
will stigmatize the proposal. Zhirinovskiy will convene another 
news conference, and Baburin has already come out unequivocally 
against it: "The deputies are being bought off. The 
authorities are evading their responsibility."

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "Call for Extended Term of </F>
Office. Vladimir Shumeyko Opposed to Parliamentary and 
Presidential Elections in 1996"] 
  [Text] Delivering a report to the upper chamber of 
parliament on Tuesday, Vladimir Shumeyko spoke against holding 
elections to the State Duma and the Federation Council in 1996. 
The activity of the first Federal Assembly, in his opinion, 
should be extended by two more years. The speaker also noted 
that the presidential elections could also be postponed. At 
least, Shumeyko stated, "it would be useful if Boris 
Nikolayevich remained for at least one more term." 
  The comment by the head of the Federation Council that Boris 
Yeltsin's presidential powers should not be restricted to one 
term is hardly sensational: Shumeyko has been saying that more 
often than anyone else. But this is the first time that the 
upper chamber speaker has expressed a wish for the life of the 
present Federal Assembly to be prolonged. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko said that the present parliamentarians 
needed an "extended" term for the following reasons: "The 
majority of deputies are beginning to understand what is 
expected of them, but soon many will be starting to think more 
about their election campaign than engaging in legislative 
activity." 
  This high-level praise of the "majority of the deputies," 
who 
are only just beginning to "understand what is expected of them" 
after six months of state service, is in itself dubious. But 
the main thing is that it is undeserved: So far the Duma 
colleagues' understanding of "what is expected of them" has 
extended only to the adoption of a single law -- on the status 
of deputies -- with a wide range of self-bestowed rights, 
privileges, benefits, and so forth. And to the amnesty granted 
to certain inhabitants of Lefortovo Prison. The publication of 
the most important laws, such as, for example, the law on the 
Constitutional Court, on the president, and on elections, is 
being delayed -- the deputies are busy with scandals, 
interfactional war, and incessant bickering. 
  Against tha background of such productivity as this by the 
Duma, the legislative activity of the president, who has been 
issuing whole sets of edicts one after another, seems to 
demonstrate an enforced need for the head of state to take the 
initiative himself. Furthermore, the scale of this initiative, 
which seems to contain just about everything imaginable -- from 
major economic decisions to edicts on housing construction and 
the fight against gangsterism -- has given observers grounds for 
saying that Boris Yeltsin has launched his own new election 
campaign. To judge from Vladimir Shumeyko's statement, however, 
what is being tested is the idea of completely forgoing 
presidential elections by extending Yeltsin's powers for at 
least one more term. Without any doubt, the aim of the 
statement was to find out what reaction it would get in 
political circles and in society. 
  The reaction was this. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced 
that he is ready to support his Federation Council colleague's 
proposal on condition that there is a perceptible stabilization 
of the economy in the next two-three months and the two chambers 
of parliament prove viable. Vyacheslav Kostikov, the 
president's press secretary, was more cautious, noting in an 
interview for EKHO MOSKVY that Boris Yeltsin had not been 
informed of Shumeyko's initiative but that, irrespective of 
that, the opinion of the Federation Council chairman "should be 
heeded." Aleksandr Yakovlev, the president's representative in 
the Federal Assembly, gave a trenchant and forthright reaction 
to Shumeyko's proposal when he said in an interview for 
IZVESTIYA: "I would regard any initiative aimed at revising the 
Constitution with great apprehension, no matter how 
well-intentioned that initiative may be. Cancelling the Federal 
Assembly elections would set a precedent which would endanger 
the existence of one of the main elements of democracy." When 
asked whether this judgment also applied to the proposal to 
extend Boris Yeltsin's term of office, the president's 
representative in the Federal Assembly replied: "Undoubtedly." 
  The idea of canceling the next presidential election has 
been around in the Kremlin for some time now in the form of 
repeated public comments on that score by Sergey Filatov and 
Vladimir Shumeyko. But this is the first time that the idea has 
been circulated politically and socially in conjunction with the 
proposal to preserve the present composition of the Federal 
Assembly for an extra two years. Clearly, it goes without 
saying that such political bartering will make the Duma and the 
Federation Council more amenable to the proposed cancellation of 
the next presidential election. There is also an assumption 
that no political party is yet really prepared for a 
presidential campaign and thus might have an interest in 
postponing it (apart, perhaps, from the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia and its leader, who are rapidly losing ground and 
realize that delay could be fatal). But so far, it seems, there 
has not been a sympathetic response in parliament to Shumeyko's 
initiative. Boris Fedorov, chairman of the "12 December" 
faction, has already stated that he does not intend to prolong 
his deputy's powers beyond the term laid down by the 
Constitution. In an interview in IZVESTIYA, Communist leader 
Gennadiy Zyuganov was even more categorical: "I believe that 
the situation in Russia has gone beyond the urgent stage. We 
cannot wait until 1995 for elections, let alone 1996." 
  The implementation of Shumeyko's proposal will require the 
amemdment of Section Two, Paragraph Seven of the Constitution, 
which lays down that "the Federation Council, First Convocation, 
and the State Duma, First Convocation, are elected for a term of 
two years." However, that does not bother the upper chamber 
speaker. Even if it is necessary to hold a referendum to amend 
the relevant articles of the Constitution so as to cancel the 
elections, Shumeyko told journalists, that referendum will be 
far cheaper than the cost of an election campaign. 
  How will this latest attempt to skimp on democracy end?

  [Text] The Federation Council insists that it be given the 
right to appoint the chairman of the Constitutional Court. It 
moved this proposal, and many other amendments to the draft law 
on the Constitutional Court to the State Duma, Chairman of the 
State Duma Committee for Legislation and Judicial Reform 
Vladimir Isakov (the Agrarian Party) told INTERFAX. 
  He said that according to the draft law on the 
Constitutional 
Court, proposed by his committee and approved by the State Duma 
at first reading, the right to elect the chairman of the 
Constitutional Court is vested with the judges of the 
constitutional court. He also said that his committee would 
recommend that the State Duma turn down the amendments advanced 
by the Federation Council. 
  The State Duma will discuss the Federation Council's 
amendments on Friday in a block, he said. He also believes that 
the Federation Council's sudden initiative complicates the 
adoption of the law on the constitutional court by both chambers. 
  This law is to be adopted by two thirds of the votes, not by 
a simple majority, Isakov said. It will be very difficult to 
secure so many votes in the Federation Council, he added.

  [Text] Prime Minister Mart Laar, commenting today on 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree of 21 June on Russia 
unilaterally demarcating the Estonian-Russian state border, said 
that this is an unprecedented case internationally. According 
to the prime minister, it is particularly regrettable that this 
step was taken at a time when talks between Estonian and Russian 
representatives are in progress. Laar thinks that this is 
probably a case of Russia putting pressure on Estonia in order 
to achieve concessions with regard to resolving the issue of 
Russian military pensioners who live here. 
  At the same time, Laar stated that Estonia will firmly 
retain 
her position and continue to call for the Russian troop 
withdrawal by 31 August of this year. Estonia will definitely 
approach international organizations in order to resolve the 
conflict that has resulted from this strained situation, Laar 
emphasized.

  [Text] Tallinn, June 22, BNS -- Leaders of Russian 
community in Estonia don't agree with a statement Nikolay 
Yugantsov, Russian Representative Assembly chairman, and Alexey 
Zybin, the elder of Russian community, released last week. 
  The statement demanded that Estonian authorities give 
residence permits to all persons registered as residents before 
July 1990, except those categories of residents listed in the 
aliens law as ineligible, military retirees among them. 
  Pyotr Rozhok, chairman of Russian community in Estonia's 
committee on Russian citizens' problems and representative of 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia, now 
issued a counter-statement declaring that his organization 
actually wants permanent residence permits for all non-citizens 
who lived permanently in Estonia before July 1993 when the 
aliens law was adopted. 
  Rozhok claimed Russian community in Estonia had forbidden 
Zybin to speak on behalf of the organization. In his opinion, 
the Yugantsov-Zybin statement actually supported "deportation of 
military pensioners." 
  Today's statement was signed, besides Rozhok, by Zybin's 
deputy, Stanislav Mikhailov, and another Russian Community 
leader, Yuri Kotenkov.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Serov] </F>
  [Text] London June 23 TASS -- Great Britain has called upon 
the Latvian leadership to reconsider "restrictive" clauses in 
its draft citizenship law, taking into consideration the 
recommendations made by the CSCE (Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe) and the Council of Europe, a British 
Foreign Office spokesman said today, commenting upon the Russian 
Foreign Ministry statement issued on Wednesday [22 June], which 
condemns the aforesaid act as discriminatory. 
  The British Foreign Office understands the complexity 
experienced by Latvia in search of a solution to the question 
about the future status of the people, who are not citizens of 
the republic. But it regards that the integration of the ethnic 
minorities constitutes an important prerequisite for ensuring 
long-term stability in the region, and therefore, expresses 
concern over some of the aspects of the draft citiznship law, 
which was adopted after its third reading in the parliament on 
June 21, the British Foreign Office spokesman indicated.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 21, BNS -- The Latvian Government's 
authorized representative -- the European Union (EU) Affairs 
State Minister Olgerts Pavlovskis initialled Monday in Brussels 
the free trade agreement with the EU, Foreign Ministry's press 
center told BNS. 
  As reported, Pavlovskis considers that the signing of the 
agreement is not only of economic importance but also political 
one, because the agreement gives guarantees for Latvia's 
security. The agreement and the declaration added to it provide 
for Latvia to sign also the associated agreement in nearest 
future, and then become a full and equal member of the EU. The 
period of Latvia's joining the EU can last from six to ten 
years, says Pavlovskis. 
  If the Saeima (parliament) ratifies the free trade agreement 
in November, import duty will not be imposed upon Latvian goods 
in the EU starting from January 1, 1995. Besides, Latvia will 
be able to increase export of its produce to the EU. 
  Some of Latvian industrial goods will have a 2-4 year long 
transitional period to enable their entering the free market. 
The free trade principles will not refer to agricultural 
products, but three protocols will regulate the trade with them 
providing for certain quotas for mutual trade. The protocols 
regulating the trade with the agriculture goods say that the EU 
plans to endow Latvia trade quotas for beef, pork, butter and 
cheese. 
  Pavlovskis noted that Latvian produce lacks attractive and 
qualitative packing, and it could prevent full use of the EU 
endowed quotas. But it is very important that the quotas, 
granted to Latvia, enable Latvia to sell its production in 
Europe. 
  Pavlovskis considers that worries about the agreements 
negative influence upon Latvian agriculture and industry are not 
motivated, because Latvia, according to the initialled 
agreement, will have a four year long transitional period during 
which import duty tariffs will be decreased for the EU 
agriculture products. 
  The Agriculture Ministry's specialists support the ready for 
signing additional protocols to the free trade agreement on the 
procedure of import duty tariffs decreasing for agriculture 
products, because the agreement provides for the order according 
to which Latvia's inner market could be defended from excessive 
flowing in of agricultural products from the EU. 
  The EU has determined a zero import duty tariff for Latvian 
made textile industry goods, and it endows quotas allowing 
Latvia to export only 30 percent of its textile industry goods, 
said Pavlovsis. Latvia will grant favorable terms mainly to 
goods that are not made in Latvia at all, and also to vegetables 
in winter. 
  The free trade agreement will promote flowing in of foreign 
investments to Latvia, setting up of joint ventures with Latvian 
producers, whose production could be sold in European states' 
markets, said Pavlovskis. Pavlovskis also noted that the quotas 
for industrial and agricultural products could be revised every 
three years thus effectively regulating the development of 
Latvia's foreign trade. 
  Latvia's 5th Saeima plans to accept the free trade agreement 
with the EU in October, 1994. The Latvian delegation will return 
from Brussels on June 21.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- The 16.3-million-lat state 
budget deficit on June 1 was completely covered with state 
treasury bills, Finance Ministry's Budget Department Director 
Gatis Kaminskis told reporters. 
  In the first five months of this year, the budget earned 
211.8 million lats, or 36.9 percent of the projected yearly 
revenues, while the spendings hit 219 million lats, or 35.6 
percent of the planned yearly expenditure. 
  Commenting on the budget situation in the first five months 
of this year, Kaminskis noted that budget incomes exceeded 
spendings 2.8 million lats what reduced the prevalence of 
spendings over incomes from 10.4 million lats late in April to 
7.19 million lats late in May. 
  The Latvian economy currently enjoys a process of 
stabilization because in May the inflation rate was the lowest 
this year, only 0.2 percent compared to April. In total, the 
inflation grew 12.4 percent since the beginning of this year. 
  Kaminskis underscored that the prediction that the inflation 
would soar after the introduction of the uniform 18 percent 
sales tax on all food stuffs in the beginning of June has not 
materialized. He also called for the improvement of the 
taxation system because the debts of sales tax and profit 
tax-payers to the national budget have increased. 
  Sales tax payments formed 66.2 million lats of the state 
budget earnings in the first five months of this year but the 
sum is 1.8 times smaller than in the same period last year. The 
debt of sales tax-payers to the state budget makes up around 3 
million lats and the State Income Service should find out the 
reason for the tendency of this debt to grow, Kaminskis noted. 
  The excise duty payments have also been unsatisfactory 
between January and May as they formed only 23.5 percent of the 
projected excise revenues.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 21, BNS -- The income of 1,300 
interviewed families increased 41.5 percent in the first quarter 
of 1994 compared to the same period last year, the Latvian State 
Statistics Committee said. The index of consumer prices rose 
34.6 percent in the period what means that the purchasing 
ability of residents grew 5.1 percent. However, compared to the 
fourth quarter of 1993 the real purchasing ability did not rise. 
  Regardless of the slight increase of family income, the 
families generally failed to earn the subsistence basket which 
was recently worth 48.74 lats and even the crisis subsistence 
basket which was worth 38.44 lats because the average monthly 
income per family was 34.54 lats in the first quarter of 1994. 
  The income of urban families grew 47 percent to reach 39.66 
lats per each family member in month while the income of rural 
families increased 28.6 percent. 
  The income of families with average monthly earnings 25 lats 
per one member increased from 16.74 lats in the first quarter of 
last year to 18.49 lats in the first quarter of this year. 
  The income of families with average earnings 45 lats and 
more 
increased from 60.42 lats to 65.29 lats per month. 
  The incomes increased thanks to the growth of official 
salaries from 15.53 lats to 22.55 lats, as well as resources 
donated by public and pension funds.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- The Bank of Latvia exchanges 
the old Latvian rubles against lats until June 30 in its central 
office and branch offices in Rezekne, Valmiera, Daugavpils, 
Jelgava and Liepaja. 
  The central bank issued 28,510,345,000 Latvian rubles in 
paper money, said the bank's spokesman Edzus Vejins. The 
transition to the national currency, the lat, started March 5, 
1993 when the first lats were introduced. The lat became the 
only legal tender in Latvia on Oct. 18, 1993, but rubles are 
still accepted for exchange. 
  Latvian residents kept 58.570 million rubles on April 1, 
Vejins said. In June, the central bank exchanged 1,835,498 
rubles. 
  The exchange rate is 1 lats against 200 Latvian rubles.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius replied to 
questions from journalists at a traditional news conference 
today. He also agreed to reply to questions by a correspondent 
of this program. 
  Asked whether there will be any changes in the government 
economic policy after the Seimas debate on a government no- 
confidence vote, Slezevicius said: 
  [Begin Slezevicius recording] We have very carefully studied 
all statements without exception by Seimas members. We have 
analyzed all critical remarks and focussed our attention on many 
of them during the preparation of a corrected government 
program. As you know, the no-confidence issue is one side of 
the matter, but now, in accordance with our constitution, we 
have, after a change of more than a half of the members of the 
cabinet, submitted a new government program to the Seimas. [end 
recording] 
  Having stated that the stability of the litas is helping the 
development of the economy but is not sufficient to make this 
development more dynamic, Slezevicius continued: 
  [Begin Slezevicius recording] In our program we emphasize 
our 
attention on those issues which require a very fast solution. 
This includes taxation policy, the administration of taxes, the 
control of borders, and improvement of the work of the customs 
offices. And, of course, it is very important to step up the 
investment process. [passage omitted] 
  A limiting factor in the development of the economy is the 
very high cost of credits, and, of course, not a single investor 
is able to use local credits for investment processes. This is 
closely connected with the credit resources of our commercial 
banks and with the stability of these banks. Together with the 
Central Bank, we have to accomplish a great deal in this sphere, 
so that the price of credits in our country goes down in a more 
dynamic manner than now. [end recording] 
  Slezevicius then stressed the government's tasks in creating 
favorable trading conditions for Lithuania's industry and 
businessmen and mentioned that at a foreign policy coordinating 
committee meeting relations with Russia were discussed today. 
Then he continued: 
  [Begin Slevevicius recording] As you know our relations with 
Russia are being extensively discussed. They are closely linked 
with the strategic situation of the Kaliningrad region and with 
the necessity of normalizing transit through our country. As it 
happens, our country is situated between two territories of 
Russia and our task is to find together with Russia mutually 
acceptable means of solving all problems. [passage omitted] 
  I think that we will find mutually acceptable solutions in 
the immediate future and that the agreement signed by Mr 
Chernomyrdin on 18 November will be implemented. [end recording]

  [Text] A televised debate between Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius and Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Homeland 
Union, was held yesterday. 
  During the debate, the leader of the right-wing opposition 
claimed that a privatization by the nomenclature is taking place 
in Lithuania with former leaders purchasing property at a half 
its true price. Therefore a draft law on the indexation of 
savings, proposed by the Homeland Union, is, above all, a means 
of combating organized crime and corruption by officials. 
  Adolfas Slezevicius, prime minister and leader of the 
governing Democratic Labor Party, rejected what he described as 
unfounded accusations and claimed that such problems have 
existed through all stages of privatization. In the prime 
minister's opinion, accusations about privatization by the 
nomenclature are only an element in the class struggle. 
  The prime minister assessed unfavorably the economic 
consequences of the law on savings compensation initiated by the 
Homeland Union. 
  The issue of increasing personal income was also raised 
during the discussion. According to Vytautas Landsbergis, the 
growth in personal incomes has been maintained by foreign 
credits. Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius said at a press 
conference on Thursday that such discussions are useful because 
the parties in the same state must serve the common state and 
not narrow party interests. Therefore, political compromises 
must be sought in political activity.

  [Text] The forthcoming visit to Riga by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton may become an important political event strengthening 
the international security of the three Baltic states, says a 
statement by right-wing opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis 
which was made public today. Lithuania should support the 
positions of Latvia and Estonia in two separate and not linked 
issues: a speedy and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops 
and a citizenship law, Vytautas Landsbergis notes. 
  As is known, the Presidents of the United States and the 
Baltic states are to meet in Riga 6 July. 
  In Landsbergis's opinion, at this meeting Lithuania should 
ensure support for its government's stand, which is supported by 
the Seimas opposition, that Russia's demands to conclude a 
bilateral military transit treaty with Lithuania are political 
and should be rejected as contrary to the provisions of the 
Lithuanian Constitution and Lithuania's national interests. 
According to Vytautas Landsbergis, it is also very important to 
know whether the principles of equal rights and opportunities in 
the relations of states with NATO are still being adhered to, or 
whether the West will be drawn into an Orwellian world where one 
NATO partner is (?more equal) than the others.

  [Text] Kerkyra June 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin declared on Thursday that an agreement on partnership 
and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European 
Union belongs to major and significant events in the European 
political life. Yeltsin spoke at a dinner given in honor of 
heads of countries of the European Union and the Russian 
president by the Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. 
  "We have been led to an agreement which will be signed 
tomorrow, by a sense of responsibility for the future of Europe 
and a great desire to give our children a more peaceful, more 
stable and free continent," he said. "This document opens new 
possibilities for the construction of genuinely integral, 
prosperous and safe Europe which plays an important positive 
role in the world of the 21st Century," Yeltsin said. 
  "The main task now is to realise the agreement as soon as 
possible and with the maximum result," the Russian president 
said. "It is in the interests of both Russia and the European 
Union - two largest political and economic centers of Europe, 
two powerful trade and economic partners. We shall imminently 
have to resolve problems which we have failed to resolve until 
now," he pointed out. 
  Speaking about concrete tasks which will have to be resolved 
in the near future, Yeltsin noted that it will be necessary to 
give Russia an access to the European Investment Bank and begin 
to unconditionally apply GATT norms and rules in mutual trade. 
It is necessary to facilitate visa regime for Russian citizens 
in EC countries, he added. 
  According to the Russian president, lifting restrictions on 
Russian goods in the EC market is of tremendous importance for 
the success of democratic transformations and market reforms in 
Russia. In his opinion, "the agreement lays a good basis for 
this." Yeltsin expressed confidence that the development of 
large-scale cooperation with Russia will give considerable 
advantages to states of the European Union. "This is a way to 
stepping up economic activities, the solution of social problems 
and primarily, the problem of unemployment," the Russian 
president said.

  [Text] Kerkyra (Corfu), 23 Jun -- "Extensive, hard work 
over a year and a half has ended with an intensive burst of 
progress," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told 
an ITAR-TASS correspondent today, replying to a question about 
the significance of the forthcoming signing of the agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the European Union [EU]. 
  Different countries, he stressed, have approached the 
establishment of relations with the European Union in different 
ways. Often those relations have been of disadvantage to those 
states. As for Russia, we have taken the path of signing a 
full- scale document which reflects not only Russia's political, 
but also its economic interests. 
  The representative of the Russian foreign policy department 
said that the talks were difficult. The final compromises were 
reached literally over the final weeks of work on the document. 
"We are grateful to our Greek friends," Churkin noted in 
particular, "who, as EU chairmen, have shown commitment and 
energy in ensuring that work was completed on the agreement 
which will be initialled this evening and signed tomorrow by 
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin and the EU leadership."

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- Grigoriy Karasin, head of the 
Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, described the Russian president's visits to Corfu and 
Brussels as Russia's and the EC's contribution toward preventing 
the division of the European continent and establishing a 
prosperous and secure Europe. Both events, he noted, will not 
just determine the course of future relations with Russia in 
many ways, but also positively affect the general climate of 
international relations. 
  The 'Partnership for Peace' program and the protocol that 
was 
made public in Brussels which give impetus to the process of 
further development of the `Russia-NATO' bilateral program of 
deeper cooperation are fully in the national interests of Russia 
as a great power, in the view of their specific features and the 
general mood in Europe, which reflects the desire for deeper 
trust and stability. According to Karasin, the signing of the 
Brussels documents signifies a mutual agreement between Russia 
and NATO as two major partners in European and global security. 
  The upcoming conclusion of the full-scale agreement on 
partnership and cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the EC will bring cooperation between Russia and the EC to a new 
level, Karasin said. "This will be of enormous potential 
benefit for the Russian economy, access of our goods to the 
European markets, and for the deepening of the mutually 
beneficial processes of economic development in the European 
region. The EC too, might draw tangible benefits from closer 
cooperation with Russia, such as a boost to its economy, easing 
the unemployment problems, and opening up new markets," the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.

  [Text] Washington June 23 Tass -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton welcomed Russia's joining the NATO "Partnership for 
Peace" programme on Wednesday [22 June], and called it an 
important step on the path to create a safer world after the 
"Cold War". 
  Speaking at a ceremomy held to mark the 50th anniversary of 
U.S. military personnel rights day, the President recalled that 
not many days have passed from the moment, the Americans and 
Russians could say, for the first time since both countries 
acquired nuclear weapon, that they no more have their nuclear 
missiles targeted towards each other. 
  Now Russia has made a decision to join 20 other countries of 
the former Soviet Union, East and West Europe, which are 
participating in NATO's "Partnership for Peace" progamme, to 
cooperate in planning and conducting joint war manoeuvres and 
join efforts in the name of a common future, the creation of a 
united Europe, where neighbours will respect each other's 
borders and cooperate in the name of general security and 
progress, the U.S. head of state said. 
  To the applause of participants in the ceremony, the 
President said that he would like to join the U.S. secretary of 
state, who was present at the signing of the documents in 
Brussels and congratulate the Russian people and its leaders on 
this far-sighted choice. President Clinton described it as one 
more step on the long path of mankind's eternal urge towards 
peace, and thanked them.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Filippov: "Accepted With a Period of </F>
Probation"] 
  [Text] Russia has subscribed to NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" program. At NATO Headquarters in Brussels Wednesday 
Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign affairs, 
signed a framework document on the general principles of 
participation in this program, whose aims have already been 
supported by 20 European states. 
  International observers have unanimously called Russia's 
signing of this program a most important stage in the new 
relations of security which have taken shape since the end of 
the "Cold War." Although the program might be far from perfect, 
it will, nevertheless, significantly strengthen mutual trust and 
openness in the interests of all European states. As a 
transitional form of cooperation, the program will provide both 
NATO and Russia with time and opportunities to formulate more 
clearly the terms of Russia's joining the North Atlantic 
Alliance. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has called the 
signing of the treaty one more stage on the way to uniting 
Russia with the West. In actual fact, however, it is, rather, 
part of a policy based on the "wait and see" principle. If in 
time it becomes clear that the economic and democratic reforms 
in Russia are becoming stronger, then there will be no 
difficulties in the way of further rapprochement; if not, 
however, there will be no need for NATO to regret that caution 
was displayed in the past, the BBC points out. 
  Russia has been granted special status with due regard to 
the 
fact that its joining NATO is not envisaged in the long term, 
Radio Deutsche Welle reports. But Russia has had to make 
concessions not only on this point. The NATO alliance has 
denied Moscow a rigid consultation mechanism and the right to 
vote on the alliance's affairs. 
  But, however positively Russia's subscribing to the 
"Partnership for Peace" program is evaluated, it is clear that 
this certainly does not mean the elimination of the 
contradictions between Russia and NATO over the aims of this 
cooperation.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy intends to have the document 
on Russia's participation in the NATO PFP [Partnership for 
Peace] program annulled. According to the leader of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the document has no legal 
force. Zhirinovskiy again confirmed that he will demand the 
resignation of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, in this 
case, for signing the framework document with NATO. Kozyrev had 
no right to sign this program since the State Duma was 
categorically against, Zhirinovskiy said.

<F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "Russia and NATO Building </F>
Bridges"] 
  [Excerpts] For many years the European continent was split 
by a deep abyss which divided the countries of the East and the 
countries of the West. It used to seem simply impassable -- in 
the political, economic, ideological, and military respects. 
One side was personified by the Warsaw Pact, the other by the 
North Atlantic bloc. 
  But times have changed. There is no longer a Soviet Union or 
a Warsaw Pact. Even the former abyss has disappeared. Russia 
and the Western countries have taken the path of developing 
cooperation. The embodiment of this new era in international 
life was the signing by Russian Federation Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev at NATO headquarters of the Partnership for Peace 
program, adopted by the alliance in January this year. [passage 
omitted] 
  It should be noted that, generally speaking, the path toward 
Russia's entry into partnership relations with NATO essentially 
began at the meeting that Army General Pavel Grachev, the 
Russian defense minister, had in Brussels in May. Subsequently, 
however, the Foreign Ministry virtually took over all the work 
preparatory to the signing of the framework document and the 
final protocol. Defense Ministry representatives were 
effectively eliminated from this work, even though the 
implementation of all the military measures within the 
partnership framework will, naturally, be the responsibility of 
the Russian Armed Forces. 
  Be that as it may, the most important thing is that the 
implementation of the Partnership for Peace program as far as 
Russia and NATO are concerned will be a bridge across that abyss 
which divided Europe until just a few years ago. [passage 
omitted]

President Bill Clinton received Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin who is at the head of the Russian delegation at a 
session of the joint Russo-American commission on economic and

  The meeting took place in the White House behind closed

the two parties paid most attention to the results of the third 
session of the so-called "Gore-Chernomyrdin" commission and to 
the agreements which were worked out during the session. 
  President Clinton expressed satisfaction with the way 
Russia's economic reforms develop, and the United States were 
concerned about their fate in the end of 1993 and in the 
beginning of 1994, she said. 
  Asked whether Clinton and Chernomyrdin discussed a definite 
date for the forthcoming Russo-American summit in Washington 
which has been provisionally scheduled for next September, the 
press secretary replied in the negative.

Vanichkin, Oleg Velichko and Vitaliy Chukseyev] 
  [Text] Washington June 24 TASS -- U.S. Vice-President 
Albert Gore described as "an outstanding success" the results of 
the session of the intergovernment Russian-American commission 
on economic and technological cooperation. 
  The commission which is co-chaired by Russian Premier Viktor 
Chernomyrdin drafted several agreements between the two 
countries over the two days of its work. Their signing ceremony 
was held on Thursday at the conference hall of the 
administration complex adjoining the White House. 
  Chernomyrdin and Gore put their signatures under the 
Russian- 
American agreement in the sphere of ecology, the statement on 
the principles of information exchange, the agreement on closing 
down plutonium-producing reactors as well as the joint statement 
on cooperation in building an orbital station. 
  The sides signed another 22 documents opening prospects for 
cooperation between the two countries in various spheres, 
including a 400-million-dollar contract on financing the 
shuttle-Mir programme. 
  Praising the results of the session, the U.S. Vice-President 
stressed that the two countries have established close and 
fruitful relations at many levels. The United States as a 
Russian partner and friend operates jointly with the Russian 
Federation for the sake of continuing progress, he added. 
  Gore called the agreement on the participation of U.S. oil 
companies Marathon oil and Mcdermott in developing the oil and 
gas deposits on Sakhalin shelf as the largest American 
investment in Russia. 
  The project is worth ten billion dollars. This is a very 
positive signal to American investors that they can successfuly 
do business in Russia, he continued. 
  The Vice-President called as very important the agreement on 
closing down the plutonium-producing reactors in Tomsk and 
Krasnoyarsk. This document is graphic evidence of mutual 
determination to act jointly to strengthen the regime of nuclear 
non-proliferation, he stressed. 
  He announced that the next, fourth session of the Russian- 
American commission on economic and technological cooperation 
will be held in Moscow next winter. 
  For his part, Chernomyrdin noted that Russia and the U.S. 
now face the task of filling up the reached agreements with 
concrete content. "Our meetings were held in an atmosphere of 
mutual understanding," he continued. 
  "indeed, there were difficulties, but we have overcome them. 
The achieved agreements are landmarks in relations between our 
states. However, we should now start work so that these 
agreements should yield practical results." 
  Appraising the results of a meeting with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton which was held at the White House earlier in the day, 
Chernomyrdin said that it was "very useful and fruitful". "We 
discussed the results of the Russian-American commission on 
economic and technological cooperation," he noted. 
  "We also discussed the G7 summit in Naples next July to be 
attended by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Some issues 
examined at the present session of the Russian-American 
commission will possibly be discussed at the Naples session." 
  The premier expressed confidence that President Clinton and 
he "established mutual understanding on issues under 
discussion". "I do not think that we have such problems which 
could not be resolved," Chernomyrdin stressed. 
  Dealing with cooperation between the two countries in space 
explorations, he noted that it is being carried "on an equal 
footing". "We have a potential in some areas and are ready to 
share it with other countries. 
  "The United States also can share their possibilities, and 
the two countries will only benefit by this." Turning to 
prospects for cooperation between the two countries in science, 
the premier said that "the sphere of operations of the 
Russian-American commission will be boosted", and questions of 
public health will be put on the agenda of the next session to 
be held in Moscow. 
  "If we can pool our resources in this sphere, the two 
nations 
will undoubtedly benefit by this," he added. 
  Participants in the news conference which was held on the 
results of the Russian-American commission, raised the question 
on the nuclear programme of North Korea and the role played by 
Russia in a search for settling this problem. 
  The U.S. Administration praises Russia's assistance and 
cooperation in attempts to settle the question of North Korea's 
nuclear programme, Gore noted. According to the Vice-President, 
contacts between Russian and U.S. foreign ministries on North 
Korea's nuclear programme as well as discussions held at other 
levels were very useful. 
  "The freezing" of North Korea's nuclear programme and 
agreement to hold a meeting between the leaders of the North and 
South Koreas are a very positive development of events, the 
Vice-President noted. He expressed hope for a settlement of this 
problem. 
  "Measures taken in this respect are an achievement as it 
is," 
the Russian premier said in turn. "It should be noted that all 
this was achieved with the participation of Russia." 
Chernomyrdin pointed to the need for broad international 
cooperation in settling this problem. 
  Speaking of prospects for a Bosnian settlement, Chernomyrdin 
expressed opinion that Russia, the U.S. and other countries 
should find a solution to this problem. "We should extinguish 
the flames which can develop into a fire at any time." 
  The Russian premier expressed confidence that Russia and the 
U.S. "are marching in the right direction", looking for 
possibilities of a settlement in Bosnia and added that a 
solution of this problem is not far away.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Igor Borisenko, Pavel </F>
Vanichkin, and Oleg Velichko] 
  [Text] Washington, 23 Jun -- The meeting that Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government held with 
members of the American-Russian business council was an 
important element in the program of his stay in the U.S. 
capital. The meeting was closed to the press but the ITAR-TASS 
correspondents managed to learn from informed sources that 
during the meeting the Russian prime minister gave most 
attention to two problems -- the development of reforms and the 
prospects for Russian-U.S. business cooperation. 
  Acknowledging that the economic situation in the country 
remains very complicated, Chernomyrdin at the same time pointed 
out that some encouraging signs had appeared, which indicated 
that the situation was improving. He singled out among these 
the fact that inflation was being brought under control and this 
makes it possible to really get down to improving the climate 
for investment and to tackle problems of social protection for 
the population. 
  Touching on problems of foreign aid for Russia, Chernomyrdin 
noted that the period when the country needed direct massive 
support from the United States had passed and what was on the 
agenda now was the question of how to arrange mutually 
advantageous cooperation. The demand for foreign investment was 
vast -- in the order of $15-20 billion per year. In other 
words, over the next 15 years Russia is in a position to 
"digest" about $300 billion from abroad, primarily from the 
United States. However, Moscow is interested in attracting 
primarily private investors. 
  The Russian prime minister stressed that the increase in 
foreign investments in the economy depends on two basic factors. 
First, his government must draw up measures to create the most 
favorable national regime for foreign businessmen to operate in. 
Second, U.S. businessmen must display initiative in response to 
this. 
  Chernomyrdin expressed concern over some obstacles that 
still 
exist in the United States and which obstruct the development of 
bilateral trade. In particular, he cited the fact that Russia 
had still not been given permanent most favored nation status in 
trade with the U.S. and he also recalled the anti-dumping 
restrictions on Russian exports. 
  The head of the Russian Government said that the results of 
the third session of the "Gore-Chernomyrdin" commission show 
that the two countries are moving in the right direction and 
that in line with this movement an increasing role is beginning 
to be played by bilateral links between private businesses.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Shinkarenko: "Partnership Requires Repeal </F>
of Jackson-Vanik Amendment"] 
  [Text] The Russian prime minister, who took part in the 
work of the Russian-U.S. intergovernment commission for economic 
and technical cooperation which ended yesterday, has used his 
stay in Washington to lend new impetus to Russian-U.S. 
relations, primarily in the economic field. 
  The partnership relations which are taking shape between 
Moscow and Washington have had a positive effect on trade 
dialogue. In 1993 trade turnover between Russia and the United 
States increased 20 percent compared with 1992 and was $4.3 
billion (in 1992 it was about $3.6 billion). There has been an 
almost threefold increase in exports -- from $639.9 million to 
$1.997 billion, which has made it possible in practice to reduce 
to a minimum the traditional deficit in reciprocal trade: In 
1992 Russian exports were a little more than four times less 
than imports from the United States. Unfortunately the structure 
of trade turnover remains the same -- reciprocal deliveries are 
based on raw material and agricultural goods. At a time when 
machine building articles make up only 2 percent of Russian 
exports to the United States. 
  An analysis conducted by experts on the eve of the 
Washington 
session showed that it is not so much the uncompetitive nature 
of many Russian goods which remain a serious obstacle in mutual 
trade as U.S. barriers on the path of high-technology items made 
in Russia and the tough antidumping legislation. That is why, 
when he set off across the ocean to take part in the 
intergovernment commission, Viktor Chernomyrdin was pursuing two 
more attendant aims. The first was to persuade legislators to 
repeal the notorious Jackson-Vanik amendments to the trade law 
which makes granting partners most-favored nation status 
dependent on freedom to leave those countries, while the second 
aim was to get the U.S. Administration to recognize Russia's 
status as a country with a transitional market economy. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting yesterday with President Bill 
Clinton and the talk the day before in the U.S. Congress seems 
to have advanced matters from a standstill. Viktor Stepanovich 
said that he "succeeded in persuading the U.S. Administration to 
grant Russia the status of a country with a transitional market 
economy" and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy commented as 
follows on Moscow's request: "I think that restrictions on 
trade with Russia should be repealed and will be repealed. That 
will require a certain amount of work. But many restrictions 
are left from the cold war and they do not apply to the present 
day."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vitaliy Chukseyev] </F>
  [Text] Washington June 24 TASS -- One can say that the 
talks have been a success, Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said on Thursday at the close of the session of 
the Chernomyrin-Gore commission and the Washington part of the 
visit. A total of 26 agreements envisaging the development of 
Russian-U.S. cooperation in various fields have been signed, he 
said. 
  "While in Washington, we signed agremeents, which are in 
point of fact, contracts which will help support our branches of 
industry which have found themselves in a hard position. It is 
primarily a question of space research and space-related 
sectors," Chernomyrdin told ITAR-TASS. 
  "Just as the Sakhalin-2 agreement, they mean the creation of 
a lot of job opportunities and provide a way out in the field of 
financing. Behind these, I perceive the social aspect, i.e. we 
shall not let in agreements which will not provide a solution to 
social issues. Take the agreement on ecology and the power 
industry -- behind them, I see the social welfare aspect as 
well," he said. 
  Touching upon his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in the White House on Thursday, Chernomyrdin emphasised that the 
best, most positive evaluation of relations between the two 
countries had been made during the conversation. 
  Asked about an extent to which the forthcoming 
Yeltsin-Clinton meeting in September was discussed during 
Chernomyrdin's stay in Washington, the Russian prime minister 
said the matters were examined but a number of them can be 
decided upon only at the presidential level, not governmental 
one. Besides, it is necessary to see how the agreements signed 
will be implemented and developed, Chernomyrdin said.

  [Text] Washington, 24 June -- It may be said that the 
talks were a success, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the 
Russia Federation Government, declared on Thursday at the end of 
the work of the Chernomyrdin-Gore commission and of the 
Washington part of his visit. All in all, 26 agreements were 
signed, providing for the development of Russo-American 
cooperation in various fields. 
  In Washington, he said, agreements were signed that were 
essentially contracts that would help to support our industries 
that are currently in a difficult position. First and foremost, 
the prime minister noted, there is the space industry and the 
industries that back it up. Like the "Sakhalin-2" agreement, 
they mean the creation of many jobs and a solution to the 
financial problems. Beyond this, I am also keeping an eye on the 
social issues; in other words, we shall not let any agreements 
through unless there is provision in them for resolving social 
issues. Take the agreements in the field of ecology and power 
engineering -- here too the social sphere is discernible. 
  Touching on his meeting with the U.S. President Bill Clinton 
on Thursday Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed that during it a very 
good and positive assessment had been given of relations between 
the two countries. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent asked to what extent the coming 
meeting in September between the Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
and Bill Clinton had been discussed during his stay in 
Washington. These matters, Viktor Chernomyrdin said, had been 
touched on, but a number of them can be decided only at 
presidential level and not at government level. In addition it 
needs to be seen how the agreements already signed will develop 
and be implemented.

  [Text] Washington June 23 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that they managed to convince the U.S. 
Administration that Russia should be granted the status of a 
country with a transitional market economy. According to the 
prime minister, this was on of the main results achieved as a 
result of the work of the integovernment Russo-U.S. Commission 
for Economic and Technological Cooperation which met in session 
on Wednesday. 
  Late on Wednesday, Chernomyrdin answered journalists' 
questions. He came out for lifting restrictions impeding the 
establishment of normal trade and economic relations between 
Russia and the United States. Chernomyrdin mentioned 
Jackson-Vanik's amendment which is still in effect as one of 
these obstacles. 
  Touching upon the problem of the possible shut-down of 
Russian reactors for the production of plutonium and a ban to 
use them for the production of nuclear weapons, the prime 
minister made it clear that "Russia fulfills its international 
commitments." According to Chernomyrdin, during the talks with 
the American delegation an agreement was reached "on the U.S. 
participation in the construction of special storages on 
Russia's territory." The sides agreed that Russia would shut 
down double-purpose reactors, while the United States, in turn, 
would partially recompense the cost. 
  Chernomyrdin confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin would 
pay 
an official visit to the United States in September, adding that 
third session of the Russo-U.S. commission which is currently 
under way in Washington can be regarded as the first stage of 
the preparation for the Russo-U.S. summit.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Albats: "Back in 1990 the USSR KGB </F>
Reported That the DPRK Had Completed the Development of a 
Nuclear Device"] 
  [Text] The polemics over the DPRK and its nuclear weapons 
are becoming increasingly fascinating. Particularly when they 
come from people who are presumably competent in these matters. 
  As has been reported, spokesmen for our Atomic Energy 
Ministry assured the press that the DPRK does not posesses the 
requisite quantity of plutonium to develop a nuclear bomb. But 
the reactor in Yongbyon, in the development of which specialists 
from the aforementioned ministry were most actively involved, is 
apparently intended to serve national economic and scientific 
needs. One deduces from this that neither we nor any other 
countries have any need to fear that North Korean nuclear bombs 
will be dropping on our heads. 
  The Atomic Energy Ministry's view was fully confirmed by 
DPRK 
ambassador in Moscow Mr. Son Song-pil, who honored the State 
Duma International Affairs Committee with his presence: "We do 
not have the technical potential to produce nuclear weapons," he 
said. 
  Finally, Russian intelligence, as IZVESTIYA wrote recently, 
also denies that Pyongyang has the technology and capacity to 
produce nuclear weapons. This is amusing. Amusing because four 
years ago it said precisely the opposite, the words coming from 
Vladimir Kryuchkov, USSR KGB chairman at the time. 
  The document that is cited below is a memorandum from 
Kryuchkov (No. 363-K) to the USSR leadership, dated 22 February 
1990 and headed "On the question of the development of nuclear 
weapons in the DPRK." Here is the full text: 
  "The KGB has been informed by a reliable source that 
research 
and development work is actively continuing in the DPRK on 
nuclear weapons. The North Korean leaders, in particular, Kim 
Chong-il, who is personally supervising the aforementioned 
research, are seeking military superiority over South Korea and 
are also pursuing the goal of joining the states that possess 
these weapons. 
  "According to available data, the development of the first 
nuclear device has been completed at the DPRK nuclear research 
center in Yongbyon, in Pyongan-pukto Province. There are no 
plans for testing it at the moment in order to conceal from the 
world public and international monitoring organizations the fact 
that nuclear weapons are being produced in the DPRK. 
  "The KGB is taking extra steps to check the data. 
  "This is for your information. 
  "KGB Chairman V. Kryuchkov." 
  A brief explanation is required. According to specialists, 
the device mentioned in Kryuchkov's memorandum is different from 
an actual nuclear bomb, in the same way, well, as... a woman 
who has only just woken up differs from one who is about to go 
out. That is, from the physics viewpoint, the nuclear bomb 
already exists, but further engineering and design efforts are 
needed before it takes shape and can be loaded in an aircraft or 
on a missile; it will have to be dressed in the proper uniform. 
As world experience has shown, these efforts will take 
two-three years. 
  But the important thing is that the device requires 
basically 
the same amount of plutonium as an operational -- albeit not 
large -- nuclear bomb. Given that, given the fact that the DPRK 
already had a device ready in 1990, and testing was only being 
prevented by certain external reasons, it means that the DPRK 
had, indeed has the requisite quantity of plutonium. 
Consequently, both our competent experts and the ambassador are 
lying. If, of course, you believe Kryuchkov's memorandum. 
  And I think it should be believed. Because despite the 
fact that relations between the USSR and the DPRK had been 
strained in recent years and North Korean special services were 
somewhat suspicious of their colleagues in the socialist camp, 
organized information channels were functioning. In the first 
place, because North Korean nuclear scientists would scarcely 
have managed without the assistance of Soviet nuclear experts 
and, second, because the DPRK was in the sphere of interests of 
a whole clutch of KGB departments. The "country of Chuche" was 
attracting the attention of both the intelligence service -- the 
DPRK was covered by its 6th department -- and the 
counterintelligence service -- the document cited above was not 
prepared by Kryuchkov himself, of course, but by Colonel V.L. 
Smolnov, who worked in the 16th department of the Second Main 
Directorate (KGB counterintelligence). Finally, the former KGB 
also had an Eleventh Department -- the department coordinating 
the activities of socialist countries' security services. It is 
now called the international relations service and is part of 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service Treaty and Law 
Administration. So despite all the strains in relations with 
the DPRK, our KGB knew how to arrange things with theirs: We 
even allowed North Korean special services to work on our 
territory -- in labor settlements where there were North Korean 
workers. 
  The point of all this is to show that as well as the 
aforesaid document there must be other, later intelligence 
reports in KGB archives on DPRK successes in developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  At a State Duma sitting Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said 
that he had all the necessary information on the subject. At a 
meeting at ITAR-TASS Kozyrev expressed fears that North Korea 
might develop a nuclear bomb in the very near future. Although, 
according to other sources, what Kozyrev means by "in the very 
near future" is in five-seven years' time. But one would hope 
that the minister really does have all the requisite 
information, including the document I cited. If not (and in our 
country, given the shambles our archives are in, anything can 
happen), then I must hasten to report to the minister that in 
fall 1991 this memorandum by Kryuchkov was stored in the 
archives of the USSR KGB secretariat, file No. 132, volume four, 
page 143, marked "Top Secret" 07-07. 
  Finally, the games our competent experts are playing are 
fascinating in their way, of course. Unless, of course, you 
consider the possibility that a mad dictator might order North 
Korean nuclear bombs to start falling on our heads and if you 
forget that we are dealing with one of the most terrifying 
totalitarian regimes, which is desperately trying to survive, 
almost on its own, and is prepared -- as our own history teaches 
us -- to go to any lengths, even nuclear blackmail, to achieve 
that. 
  Do we not fear for our children?

  [Text] Russia has not changed its point of view with 
respect to sanctions against North Korea, calling them an 
extreme and undesirable measure, declared Russia's Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. At a briefing in Moscow 
Thursday he expressed his satisfaction that recently the tension 
around the sanctions "has slightly waned." 
  Panov drew attention to Russia's proposal to convene an 
international conference on the problems of the Korean 
peninsula. In particular, he pointed out that "the bilateral 
negotiations held between the United States and North Korea, 
North Korea and IEAE, and North Korea and South Korea were 
fruitless." "It would be more expedient for all interested 
parties to meet at a conference," said Panov. 
  Moscow proposes that at this conference the agenda include 
such problems as a guarantee of the Korean peninsula's 
non-nuclear status, normalization of relations between North 
Korea and the United States, North Korea and Japan, and North 
Korea and South Korea, and implementation of confidence measures 
between North Korea and South Korea. 
  Panov also underlined that Moscow proposes to convene an 
international conference of foreign ministers in Geneva within 
two weeks after adoption of a corresponding decision of the UN 
Security Council. Panov believes that in the future the 
conference may continue its work in Pyonyang and Seoul. 
  According to Panov, the United States has given its backing 
to the idea of the conference, China and Japan have also 
expressed a positive attitude towards this idea though they 
believe that "major attention should be attached to bilateral 
negotiations." 
  Responding to Interfax concerning the possibility of a 
revision of Russia's position with respect to the sanctions in 
the case that a conference prove fruitless, Panov said: "Let's 
try such a form of negotiations and then we shall think want to 
do next."

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- A delegation from the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is going 
to visit North Korea at the beginning of October at the 
invitation of North Korean President Kim Il-song, ITAR-TASS 
learned from sources close to the LDP leadership. 
  The visit will promote the development of contacts which 
were 
established during the visit to Pyongyang by LDP Deputy Chairman 
Aleksandr Vengerovskiy in April, 1994 on the occasion of Kim 
Il-song's 82d birthday, the same source said. In an interview 
given to ITAR-TASS during the visit Vengerovskiy stressed the 
intention "to maintain an active position as regards North 
Korea." 
  LDP sources said that during Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming 
visit 
an agreement on cooperation will possibly be signed. "We do not 
reject proposals to develop contacts," the same source said.

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- A mission representing the 
United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organisation 
opened its doors for work in the russian capital on Thursday. 
"Our dreams have become a reality," UNESCO Director-General 
Federico Mayor announced at the opening ceremony of the bureau. 
"The opening of this mission became possible as a result of the 
desire and determination of the Russian Government and the 
UNESCO secretariat. It will permit the two sides to cooperate 
more quickly and effectively," he said. 
  "Russia now occupies a most-important place in world 
events," 
Mayor continued. "And our cooperation with it has developed 
wonderfully in the past several years. We have a bunch of joint 
initiatives, among which it would be worthwhile to note those 
projects concerning the Russian state library, the Bolshoy 
theatre, and the Hermitage," the director-general said. 
  "Our organisation's mission is first of all to preserve 
peace," Mayor declared. "Despite the fact that the Cold War is 
a thing of the past, our main goal on the eve of the XXI century 
is to abolish poverty and forever put an end to wars."

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- UNESCO Secretary General 
Federico Mayor has ended his visit to Russia today. 
  On the final day of the visit the UNESCO director general 
attended the opening ceremony of a UNESCO bureau in Moscow. 
Mayor pointed out that the opening of the UNESCO bureau became 
possible due to the desire expressed by the Russian Government 
and the UNESCO Secretariat to deepen mutually advantageous 
cooperation. 
  Mayor highly assessed talks he had in Moscow with the 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, Chairman of the Russian Federation 
Council Vladimir Shumeyko and Patriarch Aleksiy II, heads of the 
Russian Ministry for Science and Technical Politics, Culture and 
Education. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS Mayor said that during the 
talks the sides summed up the results of activities aimed at the 
realization of concrete projects included in a memorandum on 
cooperation between Russia and UNESCO. These projects envisage 
support to the Bolshoi Theatre, the Russian State Library and 
the Hermitage. The sides also discussed prospects for the 
development of cooperation in the field of communications, the 
organisation of international conferences, the reform of 
secondary education in Russia and the use of intellectual 
potential of Russian scientists. 
  According to Mayor, UNESCO has allocated half a million 
dollars to support various projects in Russia, predominantly 
connected with the support to research centers, special schools 
and a programme of studying the Russian language. 
  As a result of the talks agreements were reached to hold a 
second world congress on information science and education and 
establish an international department for human rights at the 
Moscow State Institute of International Relations. 
  During his visit Mayor met with representatives of 
intelligentsia, Russian mass media chiefs, the company of the 
Bolshoi Theater and students of the Moscow State University. 
The UNESCO secretary general also took part in the opening 
ceremony of an exhibition devoted to the famous French poet 
Arthur Rimbaud. 
  The UNESCO secretary general was awarded with an Order of 
People's Friendship for his outstanding contribution to the 
development of international cooperation. The award was 
conferred upon him by the Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 
Kremlin.

  [Text] Anatoliy Adamishin, Russia's first deputy Foreign 
Minister, told Interfax he does not rule out the possibility of 
the involvement of the Tajik opposition in the terrorist acts 
against Russian servicemen and ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. 
  He said, "there are many indications testifying to the 
opposition's involvement in these acts, although we lack 
conclusive proof." 
  "Using various channels, Russia has warned the leaders of 
the 
Tajik armed opposition about the threat of these methods. If we 
discover that the opposition is involved in these acts, our 
answer will be very severe," Adamishin said. 
  He stressed the fact that "Russia undertakes certain 
measures 
to bar the wave of terror. Combat patrolling has been 
introduced in places densely populated by ethnic Russians, and 
armed guard has been reinforced." 
  Adamishin does not rule out that the crimes committed in 
Tajikistan can affect the course of the inter-Tajik dialogue 
underway in Tajikistan. "Those who plan and accomplish these 
actions strive not only to provoke trouble inside Tajikistan but 
to attack the negotiation process between the government and the 
opposition," he said. 
  Adamishin expressed satisfaction with the fact that despite 
numerous difficulties inter-Tajik dialogue had been resumed. 
Russia, he said, had made a significant contribution to this 
process. "The major task of the Teheran round is to develop the 
results achieved at the negotiations in Moscow, namely to adopt 
the agreement on a cease-fire and hostilities along with several 
political measures inside Tajikistan as the opposition insists," 
he said. 
  Referring to the data presented by the Russian 
representatives at the negotiations in Teheran, Adamishin also 
said that the work on this agreement had been begun. "It is 
being carried out on the basis of the draft proposed by the U.N. 
envoy Ramiro Piriz-Ballon. The work is proceeding slowly, but 
there are some improvements. I'd like to hope that both Tajik 
parties would finally reach an agreement," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- The sending to Rwanda of the 
multinational forces under French command does not fully meet 
the "classical" criteria for UN peace-keeping, but in conditions 
of the continuing tragedy it is a step that is necessary in 
order to stabilize the humanitarian situation in that country. 
This was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the department of information and press of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  A few days ago the UN Security Council, he noted, adopted a 
decision on sending multinational forces to Rwanda. The core of 
these forces would be made up of a contingent of French troops. 
It is proposed that the French contingent will number about 
2,000 men. All the expenses connected with carrying out this 
operation will be borne by the relevant countries. 
  Russia supported this UN Security Council resolution, 
considering that this decision is an enforced step but an 
essential one in the present circumstances. Here, we proceeded 
from the position that the human tragedy in Rwanda, which is 
unprecedented in its scale, and the continuing extermination of 
the civilian population of this long-suffering country dictates 
the necessity of adopting urgent and commensurate measures 
capable of halting further bloodshed in Rwanda. Moreover, we 
have taken account of the fact that the full deployment of 
additional UN forces will need quite a long period of time," 
Karasin said.

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The Russian foreign ministry 
knows nothing about possible Israeli proposals to Syria with the 
aim of finding a possible way out of the now suspended 
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, that is how Aleksandr Shein, a 
responsible official of the Near East and Africa department, 
commented upon the latest statements made by Israeli leaders on 
this issue, during a telephone talk with ITAR-TASS. 
  On Wednesday Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
that 
certain quite interesting proposals have been made to the 
Syrians, in case they are accepted by Damascus, a breakthrough 
can be made in the Arab-Israeli negotiations within the peace 
process framework. The minister, however, did neither clarify 
the essence of those proposals nor named the channels through 
which they would be conveyed to the Syrian capital. 
  Nikolay Tikhomirov, deputy director of the Near East and 
Africa department, in this context noted Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's statement, who had said at a meeting with 
activists of international zionist movement in Jerusalem on 
Wednesday that Israel is not prepared to pay such a high 
"territorial price" for peace, which it paid during talks with 
Egypt, returning Cairo the whole occupied Sinai peninsula. 
Syria's position at the talks with Israel is well-known, 
Tikhomirov emphasised. Damascus is for an unconditional 
exchange of territory for peace. In other words, for 
compeletely returning the occupied Golan Heights and 
establishing peace between the two countries within the 
framework of a comprehensive settlement. It follows from the 
Syrian leadership's statements that they won't go in for 
anything less than this.

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- A report about the alleged 
arrival of a Russian group of specialists from the "Sukhoi" 
aircraft design bureau in the Yemeni capital Sanaa at the 
beginning of June, which appeared in the Saudi Arabian newspaper 
"AL-SHARQ AL-ASWAT", does not conform to reality, Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department in the 
Russian Foreign Ministry, said here at a briefing today. 
  Really three officials of the aforesaid design bureau had 
arrived in Sanaa on May 3, that is before armed actions began in 
Yemen, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted. Their 
visit was aimed at holding talks about the repair of Russian 
made aircraft the Yemeni Army is equipped with. However, not 
getting any opportunity to complete that programme due to 
well-known events, they left for home on May 9, Karasin noted. 
  Regarding the tense situation prevailing in Yemen as a 
result 
of continued armed confrontation, Karasin emphasised, that 
Russia favours an earliest possible end to the fratricide, 
Karasin emphasised. He drew attention towards the necessity of 
unconditionally implementing the U.N. Security Assembly [as 
received] Resolution No. 924, which calls on all sides to 
immediately cease fire and return to the negotiating table to 
resolve differences for the sake of restoring peace and 
stability. According to Karasin, any mediation efforts 
undertaken for the search of a way out of the fratricidal 
conflict in Yemen are supported in Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- The edict of President Askar 
Akayev, which is aimed at reducing the emigration of the 
Russian-speaking population from the Republic of Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan], will undoubtedly further strengthen all-round ties 
between Russia and Kyrgyzstan. This was stated today at a 
briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Department of 
Information and Press of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  "The measures envisaged in this edict," he noted, "meet the 
objective demands of an extensive part of the population of 
Kyrgyzstan half way, are a step in the development of democracy, 
boosting the main rights and freedoms of the country's citizens, 
they take into account the wishes expressed by the Russian side 
with regard to this issue, including on a summit level." 
  The representative of Russia's foreign policy department has 
also expressed the hope that the drafts for the relevant laws 
that have been submitted to the Kyrgyz Supreme Council will be 
approved and the government will take effective practical 
measures to enforce out the president's edict.

  [Text] Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin 
called the decree on citizenship adopted recently in Latvia "an 
unprecedented act for modern Europe." 
  "This decree is of a clearly discriminating nature, 
primarily 
with respect to Latvia's Russian population. It precisely 
reflects the aim of creating a mono-ethnic state in Latvia and 
gives precedence to the political interests of the present 
ruling elite at the expense of human rights," Adamishin said. 
He described the move as "playing with fire." 
  He said he was displeased with the West's reaction, which he 
described as "feeble." "One can imagine what a fuss would have 
been made if this had taken place in the former USSR," he said. 
  He also said that U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is 
scheduled to visit Riga on July 6, could find himself "in a 
rather delicate position." "By his visit Clinton will be forced 
to bless this Latvian decree and its provisions which are 
discriminating with respect to several hundreds of thousands 
people, about 30 percent of Latvia's population," he said. 
  Adamishin underlined that Russia would protest to 
international organizations, address parliamentarians, etc. 
"There should be no doubts that such attitude towards human 
rights cannot but affect bilateral Russian-Latvian relations. - 
he concluded [no end quotation marks as received].

its border with Estonia is a forced measure. This was stated by 
Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the information and press 
department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today 
in connection with President Boris Yeltsin's edict to carry out 
measures to mark Russia's state border on its Estonian section 
before the Russian-Estonian treaty on the border is concluded. 
  The edict by the Russian president, he noted, is aimed at 
creating conditions for applying the law on the border and 
defending Russia's political and economic interests. The lack 
of a physical marking of Russia's state border impedes the 
application of Russian legislative acts that deal with halting 
and punishing violations of the border and with the unsanctioned 
movement of various raw materials, including smuggling, across 
it, the Foreign Ministry representative said. 
  The marking by the Russian side of the border, which already 
exists, does not contradict either the Helsinki Final Act, or 
the treaty on the fundamentals of inter-state relations between 
Russia and Estonia of 1991, Karasin stressed. He also expressed 
the hope that at the talks between the state delegations on 
border issues the Estonian side will occupy a more constructive 
position, which would open the way to concluding a treaty on the 
Russian-Estonian border.

  [Text] Vladivostok, Russia, June 23 KYODO -- Russia and 
Japan inked an agreement Thursday [23 June] to build a disposal 
plant for liquid nuclear waste near Vladivostok in the Russian 
far east, Japanese officials said. 
  Both sides agreed to put up the construction of the plant 
for 
international bidding. The facility, which will filter 
radioactive substances from the liquid waste, is expected to be 
completed within this year. 
  In the coming years Russia will dismantle some 60 nuclear 
submarines. Several storage ships including a 2,000-ton tanker 
fully loaded with nuclear waste are currently mooring off 
Vladivostok. 
  The hazardous cargo could pose a serious threat to the 
environment as most of the vessels are worn out, although no 
leakage has so far been reported. 
  For lack of storage and treatment facilities, the former 
Soviet Union and Russia have dumped thousands of tons of nuclear 
waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its coast. 
  The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has 
sparked international protests and calls for a rapid solution to 
the storage crisis. 
  Tokyo said earlier this month the plant will be funded from 
a 
70 million dollar Japanese grant for the dismantling of Russian 
nuclear weapons and nuclear waste disposal.

  [Text] Washington June 23 TASS -- The World Bank will 
provide Russia four credits totalling 820 million U.S. dollars. 
This is the main outcome of the talks held between Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and World Bank President 
Lewis Preston on Wednesday evening. The agreements on providing 
these credits were signed by Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr 
Shokhin and World Bank Vice-President Wilfried Thalwitz. 
  Two of these credits are meant for assisting the development 
of Russia's agriculture sector. These are credits to support 
reforms in agriculture (240 million dollars) and to support land 
reform (80 million dollars). The third credit will be provided 
by the bank for restoring roads (300 million dollars), and the 
fourth for the development of financial institutions (200 
million dollars). 
  After the signing ceremony of the agreements, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said that Russia plans to create a special federal 
organization which will work with international financial 
institutions. "We requested the World Bank to put pressure on 
countries who are Russia's debtors," he said. "Finally, one 
more important result of the talks was that the World Bank 
president will pay a visit to Moscow," the Russian prime 
minister said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mark Aleksandrov: "In the Vicious Circle </F>
Which Could Lead to a Nuclear Arms Race"] 
  [Excerpts] Against the background of the vociferous 
campaign in the Western mass media over the DPRK's secession 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], reports of 
the reluctance of India and Pakistan to accede to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty have been overshadowed. Indeed, the 
press in general devotes little attention to the problem of the 
possible possession of nuclear weapons by these states. And yet 
it has a very serious character. [passage omitted] 
  Fears are now increasing all the time in the world that 
nuclear weapons could be launched in this region, since 
relations between India and Pakistan are extremely tense, and 
several times have deteriorated to the point of open military 
operations. But both these states are ostentatiously 
disregarding the opinion of other countries. Pakistan will not 
renounce its "nuclear option" until all vexed questions with 
India are settled, including the problem of Kashmir, Pakistani 
Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali stated in a speech to 
parliament. He ruled out the possibility of a compromise with 
the United States on the nuclear question; the latter is 
offering to supply Islamabad with 38 F-16 fighter bombers in 
exchange for winding down its nuclear program. The minister 
also stated that his country will not sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty until Delhi agrees to accede to this 
international document. 
  As for India, it is giving extremely contradictory signals. 
First Delhi claims that nuclear weapons arsenals must be 
destroyed worldwide, then it says that it reserves the right to 
choose whether to develop its own nuclear bomb or not. At the 
same time, it refuses to talk about signing up to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, declaring it "discriminatory." 
  Thus a kind of vicious circle is arising. Both Pakistan and 
India are continuing their research programs, with all the 
latent danger of a nuclear arms race and the danger of the use 
of those weapons. And no arguments have any effect on either 
country. 
  There are many factors here. The principal ones, of course, 
are the failure to resolve the numerous and long-standing 
problems in Indo-Pakistani relations. But perhaps not the least 
role here is played by the double standards practiced by so 
influential a state as the United States with regard to 
countries which refuse to submit to the international nuclear 
nonproliferation regime. Whereas, for instance, the DPRK is 
being subjected to real ostracism, only reproaches or 
expressions of regret are leveled at Pakistan. 
  Next year an international conference is due to be held with 
a view to extending the term of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. It is expected that the treaty will become indefinite 
and universal, that is to say, if not all the states in the 
world, then the overwhelming majority will be participants in 
the treaty. And it goes without saying that the requirements on 
all countries, whether the DPRK or Iraq, Israel or Japan, India 
or Pakistan, should be the same. All mankind is vitally 
interested in such a solution to the nonproliferation problem.

  [Text] Khabarovsk June 23 ITAR-TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier 
Sergey Shakhray today said the situation with the delivery of 
goods to the northern regions of Russia was alarming as a whole 
and bordering on emergency in several regions. The government 
commission headed by him met on Thursday to discuss deliveries 
of goods to the northern areas of the Russian far eastern 
Khabarovsk territory. 
  More than two million tons of goods are to be delivered to 
the regions within a brief navigation period. The operation 
costs an estimated 624 billion rubles, according to the 
territorial leaders. Because of the appalling shortage of 
financial resources, the deliveries of goods are being conducted 
extremely unsatisfactorily. The main supplier enterprises have 
vast debts and are unable to pay off even last year's credits. 
  There are no stocks of fuel, foodstuffs and other goods in 
ports. The Amur Shipping Line's ships lie idle in docks. 
  This year, a new system of financing northern deliveries was 
introduced, a new 5.5 trillion-ruble federal fund was set up and 
regional funds are being established, according to Shakhray. 
  Forty-five billion rubles were earmarked for the Khabarovsk 
territory from the federal fund and 47 billion rubles were given 
as credit resources. According to the governmental commission, 
Shakhray stressed, despite insufficient financing, this money is 
enough to pay for a more intensive delivery of goods to northern 
regions. The money goes first of all to pay for the deliveries 
of oil products, coal and foodstuffs. 
  Members of the commission visited the Khabarovsk port, 
examined local power plants and other enterprises. A working 
protocol identifying tasks and priorities for ministries, 
departments and other structures for the next few months and for 
the perspective was signed. 
  The government commission members are scheduled to leave 
Khabarovsk for Irkutsk on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Ovchinnikov report; from the "Pacific Ocean" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Sergey Shakhray, vice premier of the Russian 
Federation, arrived in Magadan yesterday. During the tour of 
the Far East, matters ensuring the delivery of cargo to the 
regions of the extreme north for the coming winter will be 
discussed. Before arriving in Magadan, Sergey Shakhray visited 
Krasnoyarsk and Yakutsk. After Magadan, he intends to visit 
Irkutsk and Khabarovsk. Our Magadan correspondent, Gennadiy 
Ovchinnikov, has the details. 
  [Begin Ovchinnikov recording] As the vice premier said at 
his meeting with journalists, his present tour differs radically 
from similar government visits of past years. Primarily, this 
is because he has brought real money for the resupply of the 
northern regions instead of slogans and promises. Sergey 
Shakhray said: I specifically did not leave Moscow for Magadan 
until I succeeded in getting the Ministry of Finance to transfer 
the promised 55 billion rubles here. 
  The system of credits for the delivery of cargo for 
northerners has also been fundamentally changed. From now on, 
the credits will not be undirected as they were last year, when 
the money disappeared without control to numerous traders as 
compensation for transport expenses. Second, the suppliers of 
goods will be prepaid -- that is, they will receive the money 
now and not at the end of the year. In a word, these measures 
are nothing else if not a return to the old, well-proven system 
of supplying the north which existed before perestroyka. 
  The couple of dozen deputy ministers accompanying the vice 
premier solved on the spot almost all of the problems that 
Magadan Oblast had accumulated. The remaining issues apparently 
will be solved at Magadan Airport, during the meeting with the 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who in a day or two will 
make a routine maintenance stop in Magadan on his return to 
Russia from the U.S. [end recording]

  [Text] In accordance with the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan by an edict of President Mintimer Shaymiyev Nail 
Galeyevich Aminov has been appointed Tatarstan's fully empowered 
representative in the Russian Federation. 
  Nail Aminov is a Tatar by nationality. He was born in 1945 
in Kazan and then studied in the Tatar capital. He worked in 
the Bashkir Government. In 1990 he was elected a Russian Soviet 
Federated Socialist Republic people's deputy and worked as a 
committee deputy chairman, subcommittee chairman, and parliament 
department chief. Last year he was appointed deputy chairman of 
a Russian state committee. 
  The Tatarstan representative stated in a talk with your 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent that the main parting message 
given to him by President Shaymiyev was "to serve loyally." In 
Aminov's opinion it is essential that the treaty between Russia 
and Tatarstan should be implemented in all spheres, for which 
the relevant agreements should be concluded. Nail Aminov noted 
that he regards collaboration with the recently created 
Russian-Tatar commission under the leadership of Oleg Soskovets 
as one of the most important tasks facing him and expressed the 
certainty that Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray and minister Nikolay 
Yegorov will take an active part in the commission's work. 
Aminov stated his readiness to cooperate with all Russia's 
political forces "of a constructive bent."

"Bashkortostan"] 
  [Text] Speaking at the current Supreme Soviet session, 
Bashkortostan Prime Minister Anatoliy Koptsev pointed out that 
the recent signing of agreements between the republic and the 
Russian Federation gives Bashkortostan independence in solving 
numerous problems and helps the Russian Government realize the 
need to give broader rights to the regions. In the 
Bashkortostan prime minister's view, the main thing today is to 
devise a mechanism for putting the agreements into practice. 
The 10 agreements that deal mostly with economic matters are 
the result of two years' hard work. The documents cover 
environmental protection, power-sharing with regard to 
state-owned property, customs matters, and international and 
economic relations. From now on the republic will take over 
control of the activity of the fuel and energy sector on its 
territory and will form its currency and gold reserves on its 
own. However, agreements on the budget and relations with the 
Russian Central Bank have yet to be signed. A group of 
officials from the Russian Finance Ministry currently visiting 
Ufa is studying the problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Belikov: "Foreigners Invited To Work in </F>
Moscow"] 
  [Text] A special directive from Moscow's mayor establishes 
new rules for attracting and exploiting the foreign work force 
in the capital. 
  Henceforth an employer who wishes to attract foreign workers 
to Moscow must first apply to the city government departments or 
committees corresponding to his line of work and convincingly 
justify the need to "import" outsiders. A ruling on the 
appropriateness of such an action will be delivered to him 
within 30 days. 
  If a positive ruling on the possibility of giving work to 
foreigners is obtained, the employer is to put down a sort of 
pledge for every worker invited, equivalent to the cost of the 
worker's return fare to his country of permanent residence. 
This measure is being introduced in case Moscow's 
law-enforcement organs need to deport the foreigner as an 
undesirable alien in those extreme cases which, unfortunately, 
happen quite often. If nothing of the sort occurs and the 
foreign worker returns to his home country in the normal way, 
the pledge is returned. 
  The capital's Main Administration of Internal Affairs Visas 
and Registrations Administration registers the arrival of 
foreign workers and the city's statistical service keeps a 
permanent record of them. The number of foreigners invited is 
determined according to the corresponding quotas established for 
the number of foreign citizens as a whole and the total number 
per professional group that can be hired for work in Moscow. 
Permits to attract a foreign work force are issued by the 
Russian Federal Migration Service according to the ruling of the 
Moscow government. A permit is granted to an employee for a 
period of up to one year; he cannot transfer this permit to 
other persons or organizations; nor can he transfer the foreign 
workers to another place. It is of no little importance that a 
payment of one month's minimum salary is to be made to the city 
budget in return for permits for each worker. 
  The foreigner can work on Moscow territory only when he has 
obtained a document from the city's migration service -- 
confirmation of the right to labor activity, which can be 
obtained only as a result of an application from an employer and 
only within the permitted quota. Exceptions are made for highly 
skilled foreign specialists invited to take up leading posts in 
enterprises with foreign investments, and also diplomats, major 
scientific and cultural figures, priests, correspondents and 
journalists accredited in our country, and some higher education 
students and specialists. 
  The first survey of the number of foreigners invited to work 
in Moscow is scheduled for 1 August.

  [Text] The Russian government allowed the Chukchi 
Autonomous Area administration to trade in oil products with 
European countries so as to use the hard-currency proceeds for 
purchasing oil products in the Asian-Pacific Region, a source 
close to the government told the Petroleum Information Agency. 
  The government ordinance of June 15 instructs numerous large 
refineries in the Russian West to earmark quotas of oil products 
for the Chukchi peninsula. 
  Experts believe that the decision to allow the Chukchi 
administration to sell oil products to Western Europe and to buy 
them abroad was made because it is cheaper to import fuel to 
Chukchi from abroad than from other regions of Russia. 
  The funds the Russian Finance Ministry raises from 
collecting 
export and import customs duties, levied on export and import of 
oil products earmarked for the Chukchi Autonomous Area, will be 
used to pay for import of these fuels into the area.

directorate], the debt is currently in excess of 400 billion 
rubles [R] and has grown by R50 billion in the past six months 
alone. At the same time, the power workers owe a total of R43 
billion to Uraltrasgaz [Urals gas line]. The association's 
chief engineer regards the situation as deadlocked and may cause 
the South Urals economy to collapse. Indeed, if one imagines 
the electric furnaces at the huge iron-and-steel plants here 
being de-energized or -- God forbid -- the power supply to the 
nuclear complex being suspended, all this threatens far greater 
consequences than just the closure or shutdown of an engineering 
plant.

  [Text] The international community focused its attention 
on problems concerning the utilization of liquid radioactive 
waste in the Far East yet again. An international commission 
comprised of leading Japanese and British experts arrived in the 
Maritime Kray capital today. The representative delegation is 
headed by Jun Yamada, deputy chief of Japanese Foreign Ministry 
Department of Nuclear Energy. For three days, experts will hold 
talks with the kray administration, specialists of the State 
Committee for the Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, 
and the command of the Pacific Fleet. They will also visit the 
Zvezda nuclear submarine repair plant in the city of Bolshoy 
Kamen. The commission intends to apply conclusions drawn from 
the trip and propose to local authorities and fleet command 
methods of utilization of liquid radioactive waste.

  [Text] A regional privatization voucher outlet opened in 
Maritime Kray center. Its main goal is extending post 
privatization assistance to Russian companies in Siberia and the 
Far East. It is largely a commercial structure, and was founded 
by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry. Its capital of $30 million will be 
used to finance the vitality of investment projects. Moreover, 
the Japanese Government will extend assistance to the Fund for 
Technical Aid to the tune of $20 million. Speaking at opening 
of the new investment structure, Nobuachi Ito, representative of 
the Japanese Foreign Ministry, announced that the Land of the 
Rising Sun had high hopes for cooperation with enterprises of 
this region of Russia because the privatization program has been 
implemented here with the greatest degree of success. The 
Japanese expect a positive response from local industrialists, 
and hope for long-term and fruitful cooperation.

<F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Leonid Kuchma </F>
from the Kiev studio -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed electors. Every presidential candidate 
toured virtually all the regions of Ukraine and had many 
meetings with our electors. I was doing the same thing, which I 
am going to tell you about, about something I am today, as they 
say, deeply convinced of. 
  First. People want to have hope. They want to have hope in 
the future. Unfortunately, they do not have it today. People 
want to live so that there is order in the country and decency 
in all the echelons of power. Today, this is unavailable. 
  And, second, which is most important, actually everybody 
wants to live in an independent, sovereign and democratic 
Ukraine. But what is needed for this? For this we must create 
a strong economy. Because all issues dealing with science, 
culture and spirituality can only be solved if a strong economy 
is created. 
  If one looks today at every candidate's program, they are 
virtually [word indistinct]; the difference is very slight. The 
algorithms, as they say, of getting out of this protracted 
crisis are virtually the same. And I am very glad that my views 
one year ago and today are that the future way of our state 
toward a strong economy lies through a single economic space 
with all the republics of the former Soviet Union, including 
Russia. And our relations with Russia should not be maintained 
at the expense of our relations with other states. 
  In truth, our economy was developing in the former Soviet 
Union as a single organism, and it is from there that we receive 
virtually all our raw materials, and the markets for our goods 
are, as a matter of fact, in Russia and other republics of the 
former Soviet Union, and if we want to be civilized in the 
world, among the civilized countries of the world, then, really, 
our state should become a civilized bridge between the countries 
of the West and the countries of the former Soviet Union, 
between the latest Western technologies and what we have today. 
Our economy today, as a matter of fact, cannot live in the 
world economic space due to our technological backwardness. 
  Actually, the views of all the candidates have become more 
or 
less uniform from the point of view of solving the Crimea issue, 
and from the point of view of the Black Sea Fleet and from the 
point of view of bilingualism. 
  I would really like us to have a conversation today in terms 
of concepts so that we would also have an opportunity to look at 
these years of our [word indistinct], of our independence and, 
really, to determine, at least strategically, the main thing -- 
the way our state develops. I am convinced that we are all 
similar in respect to this. 
  Thank you. I am ready for cooperation.

<F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Oleksandr Moroz </F>
in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Dear compatriots, esteemed comrades, and my 
honorable competitors: Lately we have heard so many horror 
stories about a change of the president leading to a civil war 
in Ukraine. I can only say I am an optimist and am convinced 
nothing grave will happen. 
  We shall build a strong, prosperous Ukrainian state, but 
only 
by working, being together, and not hoping for some 
extraordinary help. [passage omitted] 
  I believe the president's role must above all be to 
consolidate all power structures and enable the organization of 
power both centrally and locally. [passage omitted] 
  We today formed a working commission at the Supreme Council, 
which is to check the program of privatization and sort out who 
has taken what for how much and on what conditions. If someone 
has taken something unlawfully, they should put it back. 
  We have a different view on the problem of land reform. I 
have established this by collating positions by many of 
Ukraine's citizens and know that Ukrainian land must not become 
a commodity and must not be sold out. Otherwise, there shall be 
no justification for us in the future. [passage omitted] 
  I believe we must introduce serious changes to our state's 
domestic and foreign policy. I can explain the details of these 
changes when answering questions. I would, nevertheless, like 
to briefly describe the contents of two other very important key 
elements. One of them is the issue of international economic 
cooperation. It is not only with Russia that we must have good 
economic relations, but also with the other countries that 
formerly constituted the USSR and that are now our neighbors. 
  One more thing is to do with the independence of our 
Ukraine. 
I shall say the following, which is quite unorthodox: I 
believe we must have an independent Ukraine. But independence 
is only the state where people populating it feel independent. 
It is in that respect that we shall still have to do a great 
deal. But there will only be success if we act together, from 
top to bottom. So I am asking you, esteemed electors, on the 
evening of 26 June, to help me form the power structures that 
will work as a team.

<F P=106> [Presidential election campaign address by Volodymyr Lanovyy </F>
in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] I believe that the president 
must begin by repaying the state's debts to its people. In the 
first months after my election, I will conduct financial 
operations to compensate the population for the loss of bank 
savings and the devaluation of possessions. Apart from this, we 
will repay all debts in connection with government bonds, 
insurance, and payment for farm produce in 1991-93. The main 
focus of my activity will be economic recovery. We must give 
enterprises a chance to work and cancel all administrative 
restrictions, prohibitive taxes, licences, and quotas, which are 
smothering enterprises today, hiking up interest rates to 
unheard-of proportions, leading to a payment crisis, and 
bringing business to a halt. We will ensure financial 
stabilization in society, with stable prices, currency exchange 
rates, and wages. This will provide the basis for an increase in 
production and an increase in pay. Our calculations show that 
in six months after these reform measures, we will be able to 
raise wages four- and five-fold, taking the average wage up to 
the equivalent of $90-$100 monthly. [passage omitted] 
  We will not be able to make a move forward until we 
regionalize our life; that is, grant social and economic 
independence to oblasts, the autonomous republic of Crimea, and 
local authorities, both in terms of democratic self-government 
and necessary financial and tax opportunities, independence in 
regulating the investment, and production climate and foreign 
trade on their territory. Apart from this, we are faced with a 
very important task of ridding ourselves of national 
self-isolation we have wound up that smothers us today in 
economic and humanitarian terms. We must become active in 
international life, profit from foreign trade, and repatriate 
hard currency, which is currently kept abroad, depriving us of 
economic confidence. We must become an active participant of 
the political life. We will, of course, be admitted to the 
international community, and we will become one of the civilized 
nations in the world. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Mykhaylo Soroka: "Open Dialogues With People"] </F>
  [Excerpts] A day after a visit to Luxembourg, where, as 
everybody knows, an agreement on partnership and cooperation was 
signed between Ukraine and the European Union, Leonid Kravchuk 
visited Odessa Oblast, and on Friday -- Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. 
[passage omitted] 
  Following are certain typical questions and Leonid 
Kravchuk's 
responses. [passage omitted] 
  [Question] Does it make sense to hold presidential 
elections, given the fact that decisions made by the current 
Supreme Council have practically reduced the president's role in 
the state to nothing? 
  [Kravchuk] I would answer this question as follows: Certain 
deputies' view is to make the president absent from our state's 
political structure. This is their right. But, while stating 
this, they are simultaneously voting to hold the presidential 
elections. Where is the logic? Now, I will really answer your 
question. If the election is held, and the president is elected 
in accordance with the current law, meaning that he is elected 
head of the state and executive branch, this will mean that the 
people have voted for a presidential-parliamentary state. This 
will be a peculiar referendum, confirming that the people want a 
president -- a guarantor of independence, social protection, and 
the Constitution. Addressing the Supreme Council, I said that 
when the president is finally elected, all subsequent attempts 
to reduce his powers will fail, because the president will act 
in the name of the people. From this viewpoint, the presidential 
elections will make sense. 
  [Question] Why did you propose Vitaliy Masol for the office 
of prime minister, even though you had been against him prior to 
that? 
  [Kravchuk] No, I had not been against Vitaliy Masol. He was 
dismissed when the Soviet Union still existed, and when the 
Communist Party of both the Soviet Union and Ukraine was fully 
in power. Vitaliy Masol was then invited to the Central 
Committee, and it was recommended that he step down, taking the 
existing situation into account. He sought to obtain support 
outside Ukraine's borders (he can personally confirm that), but 
he did not find any. Thus, I was working with Vitaliy Masol, 
though not directly, but as the Ukrainian Supreme Council 
chairman. I believe that he is an educated, experienced man. 
His program indicates that he has altered his way of viewing 
Ukraine's problems and economy. I would like him to achieve 
everything, and that nobody hamper him. Other candidates for 
the office of prime minister, as far as I understood the 
situation, would not have been supported by the parliament. 
Currently, Vitaliy Masol satisfies the interests of many people. 
  [Question] What are your personal relations with Boris 
Yeltsin currently? 
  [Kravchuk] My relations with Boris Yeltsin are normal, just 
as between people who have known each other for a long time, who 
know their strong and weak sides, and even when it is better to 
phone each other. Yet, obviously, the Russian president 
protects the interests of Russia, because otherwise, the 
Russians would not need such a president. Unless the Ukrainian 
president protects the interests of Ukraine, defends its 
integrity, sovereignty, and statehood, Ukraine does need such a 
president either. Thus, we both protect the interests of our 
states. However, this protection must not lead to the suffering 
of both peoples. This is an art, the art of political 
leadership. So far, we have been successful. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview given by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to </F>
an unidentified correspondent; place and date not given; 
monitored in progress -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You are not only a presidential candidate, 
but also a person whom fate decreed to be the first president of 
contemporary Ukraine, a post you now hold. How would you 
describe the present condition of the Ukrainian state? 
  [Kravchuk] First, I am able to say today that this state, 
Ukraine, finally exists. Throughout many centuries it did not 
exist, and now it is here on the world map, recognized by the 
world community. It is a fact. It is the result of the great 
effort of our people, our parliament, our president, our 
government and all the power structures. [passage indistinct] 
We have the will of the people, we have the laws reflecting 
this will, and we have the efforts of the president and other 
power structures to implement this course. It is difficult 
indeed. We, and the people, can see that. But we can sincerely 
say that nobody in the world can hope to cover this road with 
ease. [passage indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] What in Ukraine's present condition worries 
you most? And what do you think must be done to improve that 
condition? 
  [Kravchuk] The hardships are of a both objective and 
subjective nature. What worries me most is the hardships in the 
economic system and the economy in general, the decline in 
living standards. The first thing we must do is stabilize 
production. The next thing is to do all in our power to give it 
a boost. This is the basic and all-determining factor, because 
this is the basis of all our future steps, be it to safeguard 
social security, or, for example, to raise pay in the Army, 
which we must do and will do at any cost -- to provide officers 
with housing and raise their pay -- or to improve the financial 
status of the vulnerable strata -- pensioners, the disabled, and 
many other categories of people here who need this kind of 
improvement to secure them a more or less acceptable lifestyle. 
This is the main thing. How can it be done? There are ways to 
do this. There are programs both in the government and in the 
Supreme Council, and I hope they will be eventually approved; 
mechanisms will be worked out, and we will find the resources to 
do it and to move forward. 
  There is also the political situation. We need to overcome 
the differences in the existing views of our economic and 
political development. This is a must. We must be united in 
our need to develop, to overcome the obstacles and to move 
forward. 
  Regrettably, however, everything is being done to make us 
fall out [words indistinct] to find differences between the 
president, the prime minister and the chairman of the Supreme 
Council. I can see now how the press is attempting to do this. 
[passage omitted] Today, however, there is another danger, 
(?you know), in that a (?certain) part of the leftist forces is 
giving in to (?wicked malice), [words indistinct] in Donetsk and 
Lugansk oblasts, and everything repeats itself (?once again). 
At the beginning, there were (?just a few people) demanding a 
Nuerenberg process to try the Communist Party. I had to make 
the greatest effort to ward this off, excuse me, legal 
Bacchanalia. We averted it, prevented it, and no heads rolled. 
Right now, it appears, yet another victimization is being 
called for, now of (?the other) side. I was simply terrified to 
listen [words indistinct] to a group present in that hall. You 
may have (?already) heard [words indistinct] in Donetsk oblast. 
[Passage indistinct]. So there is (?a danger), a threat -- (?as 
long as there are those forces) -- there simply is a threat of 
losing statehood and, most importantly, democracy. [Words 
indistinct] and (?those methods) have nothing in common with 
democracy. 
  So I would just like to appeal to the electorate (?and all) 
to stop that Bacchanalia and restrain the people on either side 
making an attempt on the sacrosanctity of democracy and 
statehood, for it is the people themselves who (?in the long 
run) will be taken hostage of all this. We have already seen 
this. We already (?know) this. So (?we should avert) this 
danger. 
  So, there is both some progress, there is the state, state 
establishments and certain basis of what has already been done, 
and there are forces [words indistinct] fighting for power can 
lead to the irreparable. So we at all costs will have to stop 
extremism (?in all its manifestations) on either side and 
prevent any, I would like to emphasize, any attempt on democracy 
and our state, because there is, I would like to repeat, that 
threat. 
  [Correspondent] [Passage indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] I agree. There should be stable laws and a well- 
established constitution corresponding with the changes that 
have taken place, and a stable [word indistinct]. That is a 
must. For example, government is a problem for us [words 
indistinct] changes to parliamentary elections because there are 
(?some difficulties) in that the laws and the constitution do 
not agree with each other, a disagreement which makes it 
possible to initiate constant changes accordingly, that (?affect 
the stability) of government. I agree with that. 
  That problem, however, is not just a matter of 
personalities. 
It once again has to do with the Constitution and the laws, 
i.e., the basis that was defined and supported by the people and 
tolerates no such changes. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, my understanding is that 
today you will do without electoral promises. 
  [Kravchuk] [Passage indistinct] Second, I will certainly do 
whatever I can in order to prevent a conflict between Ukraine 
and other states, for Ukraine never to be the first to take any 
action aimed at an attempt on human life, war or threat [words 
indistinct]. Clearly, (?quite another) matter is someone coming 
and trying, let us say, to suppress us. Any state and any 
people would protect themselves. That, however, would be 
protection rather than aggression by us. 
  As for (?an empire), I have already addressed that question 
and would really like it never to re-emerge. To achieve that, 
however, we need to (?do everything we are doing), laying the 
foundation of our peaceful, democratic and well-considered 
policy, good-neighborliness and partnership for us to move 
forward. Life goes on. There will be new people coming to 
power, while that which we are doing today and the foundation we 
are laying today is to continue. [Passage indistinct]. 
  I believe [words indistinct] our wealth and achievements 
that 
we have secured in the time that has passed (?since 
independence). (?I belive) that Ukraine will resolve any 
problems [words indistinct].

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] According to Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, a 
threat to democracy in Ukraine stems from some increasingly 
aggressive left-wing forces. 
  In a televised address Wednesday [29 June] night, he 
denounced what he described as madness in Ukraine and called for 
efforts in support of democracy in the Republic. 
  He also warned that the struggle for power in Ukraine could 
lead to disaster and called for an end to extremism. 
  He emphasized that Ukraine was pursuing the course, chosen 
at 
the referendum of 1 December 1991, when more than 90 pct of 
Ukraine's citizens favored independence. 
  Kravchuk said he believes there is nothing more important 
than to create an incentive for production and development. 
  At the same time, he regretted that no effort was currently 
being spared to set the top bodies of power at loggerheads and 
find contradictions between the president, the premier, and the 
parliament's speaker.

<F P=106> [Report by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Situation in Ukraine. </F>
Leonid Kravchuk: The Last Dash -- to the East"] 
  [Text] The closer we get to the finishing line of the 
election race in Ukraine, the clearer it becomes that the only 
hot favorites are Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, who enjoy 
the affection of the Republic's west and east. It is not 
impossible that the "in-between" position of Crimea may prove 
decisive in this politico-geographical polarization of opinions. 
As for Yuriy Meshkov, he has again demonstrated his skill at 
vanishing from his native climes at the right time, once again 
provoking Kravchuk into sharp actions in Crimea. The 
expectations of the Simferopol president may, however, not be 
vindicated: It is mainly the Kiev president who has until 
recently been scoring points out of confrontation. 
  Much as KOMMERSANT-DAILY supposed on 21 June, Kravchuk could 
not resist the temptation to capitalize on the absence of 
Meshkov, who left for Geneva at a crucial moment with no special 
objective. Yesterday Kiev already announced the annulment (by 
Kravchuk's edict) of Meshkov's edicts of 4 May "On Items in 
Republic of Crimea Ownership" and "On the Privatization of 
State-Owned Enterprises of the Republic of Crimea" as "not being 
in line with Ukraine's legislation." This is just one of the 
signs of the Ukraine president's sudden attention to economic 
questions. This same election race should perhaps be seen as 
the reason for Kravchuk's turn toward the economy: His rival, 
Kuchma, has a special liking for the economy, on which he builds 
his campaign. 
  Kravchuk's economic breakthrough has touched on rather 
delicate matters. Having shown an inclination to break down 
customs barriers with the European Community (as part of the 
partnership agreement he signed the other day), the president 
nevertheless decided to beef up the customs service with respect 
to Russia. Kravchuk's reasons (he shared them with the workers 
of the "Azovmash" joint-stock company in Mariupol) boil down to 
the phrase: "It pains me when the country is being hurt." The 
president remarked: "It is inadmissible that the already none 
too rich Ukraine's market should be laid waste. If the border 
were now opened, a considerable proportion of consumer goods and 
agricultural produce would be carted away to Russia." And this 
is true: You need only look at the rugged rows of Ukrainian 
shuttle traders outside the Kievskiy rail terminal in Moscow who 
exchange fatback at almost dumping prices for the Russian ruble, 
which is a picture of health (compared to the Ukrainian 
karbovanets). By his other edict the president demanded that 
Ukrainian producers declare, within 10 days flat, their hard 
currency in a bid to stem its outflow from the Republic. That 
is to say, he has thrown down the gauntlet to Kuchma. Now 
Kravchuk, known in the western regions as a "guarantor of the 
independence of a united and indivisible Ukraine," has a chance 
to melt the hearts of the promarketeers even in the eastern 
lands, which are Kuchma's turf. In fact, "eastern" coal miners 
and steelworkers were rewarded the other day with edicts solving 
their financial problems.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent viktor demidenko, mikhail </F>
melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev 23 June TASS -- In the run up to presidential 
elections in Ukraine, Ukrainian democrats decided to close their 
ranks in order to back presidential candidate Leonid Kravchuk. 
Chairman of the "Ukraine" democratic association, Dmitriy 
Pavlychko, said that the "Ukraine" wants Leonid Kravchuk to 
remain in the post of the Ukrainian president. 
  Public opinion polls show that Kravchuk enjoys the support 
of 
62 per cent of Ukrainian women, 42 per cent of rural residents 
and 90 per cent of the population of Ukraine's western regions. 
However, Kravchuk's rating in the east and the south is not so 
high. However, experts reminded of the fact that during the 
first presidential elections Kravchuk had won with only a 10 per 
cent rating in his favour reported in the Galichina region. 
  Observers noted that Kravchuk's popularity has been growing 
in recent weeks. Primarily, this can be accounted for by his 
decision on the indexation of the population's deposits in 
saving banks, the allocation of 40 million karbovanets for the 
organisation of summer vacation of children from low-income 
families, taking currency back to Ukraine, signing an agreement 
on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and EC. 
  Representatives of the old generation welcomed the election 
of Vitaliy Masol to the post of the premier, whose candidacy had 
been suggested by the president. Political experts believe that 
Kravchuk is such a clever politician that he would manage to win 
over to his side 18 per cent of electors ho had not decided yet 
for whom they would vote in the elections.

  [Text] Of all of Ukraine's presidential candidates Leonid 
Kravchuk continues to receive the best rating, which has 
remained unchanged over the past week. Thirty percent of voters 
in 24 regions of Ukraine and in Crimea intend to vote for him. 
  An opinion poll by Kiev's International Sociology Institute 
and the Sociology Chair of the Kievo-Mogilyanskaya Akademiya 
University has found Kravchuk has 1 percent more support than in 
the previous poll of 6-10 June. 
  Leonid Kuchma lost 1 percent of the votes since that time -- 
he still has the support of 22 percent of the electorate. 
  Eleven percent intend to vote for A. Moroz (against 9 
percent 
in the previous poll). The electorate's support for the other 
candidates is distributed as follows: V. Lanovoi -- 8 percent 
(earlier 6 percent), I. Plushch -- 3 percent (earlier 4 
percent), V. Babich -- 1.2 percent (earlier 1 percent), and P. 
Talanchuk -- 0.5 percent (earlier 1 percent). 
  Ten percent of those polled are against all candidates and 
15 
percent are undecided yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Kuchma, Ukrainian people's deputy and </F>
presidential candidate: "Ukraine As I See It"] 
  [Text] I am often asked: What is my vision of Ukraine? 
  I will answer laconically: I see Ukraine as an independent 
and prosperous state ruled by law and order, by decency and 
professionalism. 
  Only such societies are viable, in which human dignity is 
the 
highest criterion. The level of civilization in such societies 
is determined by their attitude toward their own history, 
regardless of how tragic that history may be. 
  We will not be given another version of history. The most 
grave sin is to mock the memory of past generations for the sake 
of a momentary political gain. 
  The biblical story of Ham, who was damned for his disrespect 
for his father in a moment of weakness, can be applied at any 
time. The same refers to the simultaneously blessed Japhet and 
Shem, who "turned their faces so that they would not see their 
father's nakedness." 
  My concern for Ukraine is not a concern for antiquated 
things, Cossack's breeches, and parochialism; it is a problem of 
making fresh gains -- from declared "independenceness" 
[nezalezhnitsvo] to economic self-sufficiency which is a 
prerequisite for safeguarding our real sovereignty. To 
accomplish this task, I formulate my program according to the 
principle paraphrased in John Kennedy's well-known statement: 
"Ask not what Ukraine can do for you; ask what you can do for 
Ukraine." 
  I know that -- owing to some "knights of the pen," who 
"neatly" extracted one convenient phrase out of context -- I am 
being portrayed as an unsuccessful prime minister who, so to 
say, has been trying to clarify for a long time exactly what 
type of society we shall build. In the end, he resigned without 
having grasped anything. Nothing could be further from the 
truth! 
  It was not up to the prime minister, but up to the Supreme 
Council to determine the model of society we wish to build. The 
president had to say his meaningful word, too. The prime 
minister, as chief executive, had to be only informed of the 
general doctrine. The law is the law -- the activity of every 
branch has to be performed within the limits of their plenary 
powers. 
  Every epoch -- especially an interim one -- should have its 
philosophical concept and principles. Without these principles, 
government activities transform themselves into a daily routine 
of "trial and error." Furthermore, the people can become a 
nation only if they are united by a common idea, if they are 
assured of their historical destiny. This should have been 
determined immediately and without delay. 
  The traditions of our society and the conclusions of our 
leading sociologists should have also been taken into account. 
Our sociologists conclude that our people, as a whole, are 
deprived of national consciousness. They have no clear social 
direction for the future. Their new ideal, a strategic goal, is 
proposed primarily by making comparisons with other, more 
prosperous countries. Unfortunately, this is not done on the 
basis of their own historical experience. Ukraine, yet again in 
its tragic history, has come to a crossroads. 
  That national ideal, which was proposed on 1 December 1991, 
exhausted itself the very next day. Still, it was formulated 
precisely: independence and separation from Moscow. 
  What next? 
  What form of government should we adopt: presidential or 
parliamentary? What state: unitarian or federal? What final 
form of social, political, and economic system is desired by 
Ukraine? What role in the production process has to be granted 
to private business, the state, and corporate entities? Which 
model of social protection and market regulations is more 
attractive? Will Ukraine maintain (and if the answer is "yes," 
then by what means) its orientation toward socialist values 
(which have become an everyday reality in the majority of EC 
countries), or, on the contrary, will it gravitate toward the 
system of capitalist competition, of which the United States is 
a model? 
  These questions cannot be avoided. 
  All these options were endlessly and fruitlessly argued. In 
the end, a state of uncertainty prevailed. At best, this 
uncertainty bears witness to intellectual weakness and 
professional incompetence of the ruling elite. At worst, it was 
the consequence of direct sabotage on the part of certain forces 
seeking to fish in murky waters. 
  Some high officials of the ruling elite tried to compensate 
for their lack of constructive ideas by forcing conflicts 
concerning problems arising between former USSR countries over 
territorial and military issues. It was the time when the 
imperial itching had just started to develop in our neighbor 
country. For some time, external factors drew public opinion 
away from internal problems, but it has only reaped dubious 
dividends. This was not a "horse" on which we could ride into 
the world community. 
  Valuable time was being lost, while our young Ukrainian 
statehood was sucked more and more into the whirlpool of 
economic crisis imported, to a great extent, from the 
"Gaydarized" [pun on Russia's former prime minister name] Russia 
by Ukrainian supporters of the IMF model. The content and 
direction of the IMF model is intended to bring the 
technologically backward countries of the former USSR into the 
global market after the devastation of all their enterprises and 
branches capable of competition with Western firms. Regions of 
the former USSR were to produce only those commodities which 
were disadvantageous for the West (due to their lack of profit 
potential or lack of raw materials) or undesirable due to 
environmental reasons. Ukraine was to assume the role of 
Europe's backyard. 
  The former Soviet nomenklatura, which had come into power 
in the newly created republics along with "businessmen" of the 
shadow economy, supported this model joyously, seeing an 
opportunity to "grabatize" statehood and share it with 
foreigners. Millions of working people were facing, after the 
abolishment of collective exploitation by the CPSU nomenklatura, 
the "bright" prospect of working for the new masters of 
appropriated enterprises. The ruling elite of the newly created 
states were to protect the newly born capitalism by means of 
severe restrictive measures until nouveau riches would be so 
efficient as to pay decent wages for their employees. However, 
how long would it take for our "wild capitalism" to assume a 
"humane face?!" 
  The model of forced liberalization, which was thrust on us 
by 
the West, ignored the fact that mass bankruptcies can trigger a 
social explosion. Now, workers are facing only one alternative 
-- to become either nationalist extremists or leftist radicals. 
This is already a dangerous thing. Today's society is showing 
signs of hysteria on the one hand, and decline, apathy, and even 
doom -- on the other. 
  Does one need any other evidence of a catastrophic situation 
of our society in addition to widely known facts testifying to 
the polarization of wealth and misery? If so, then let us take 
a look around: A blind desire to get rich and the bustling 
activity of mainly professionally incompetent people, who 
attempt to rule the state and build the market, are introducing 
chaos and profanity into society. Variations of this profanity 
could be heard in the arias of "the Varangian guest" on the 
attractiveness of an absolutely free society, in which the state 
assumes only the role of a "night watchman." It is high time to 
start living by our own wits, because overseas "well-wishers" 
take care of their own interests first. 
  Ukraine has to rely more on its own resources, proceeding 
from the fact that one year (and, all the more, 11 months when I 
was prime minister) is not enough time for a minimal 
stabilization period. 
  To put an end to general disintegration and pilfering, we 
should realize the following (and this is supported by the 
experience of those countries which have overcome their low 
level of social differentiation and specialization): The state 
will be forced to use stringent measures for securing law and 
order, as well as legal sanctions against those violating the 
"rules of the game" established by the state in the realm of 
business, the pilfering of national wealth, and neglecting the 
norms of social life. 
  Let us not forget that habitual, moral, and legal regulators 
in force in developed Western countries were attained over the 
course of many centuries. 
  Thus, the minimum program for Ukraine consists of the 
implementation of a "social state" doctrine oriented toward 
overcoming social erosion and the structural ambiguity of 
society. The emphasis is being placed here on safeguarding equal 
rights for all sectors of the economy -- private, cooperative, 
state, and corporate -- along with guarantees for the essential 
needs of citizens in the sphere of health care, education, and 
pensions. 
  The building of the "social market economy" is a program of 
the utmost importance for Ukraine, which will be carried out 
simultaneously with the view for a more stable period, following 
the creation of conditions for efficient economic activities of 
the people who have already acquired necessary commercial, 
professional, and other habits after the narcosis of 
totalitarianism. 
  Thus, the key issue today is not that of a social ideal, but 
of a concrete model for social relations during the 
stabilization period. Taking into account the fact that a split 
with society along the "socialism-capitalism" line again looms, 
the issue should be shifted from the "either-or" opposition to 
the personal level. People who adhere to some principle or 
another should have the freedom of choice within the borders of 
one state, just as it is in China (one state, but two social 
systems) or, for instance, in Israel (private sector, but also 
collective farms -- kibbutzzim). 
  We should make our way into a new system of coordinates: We 
have lived, and we will continue to live, in the immediate 
future under the circumstances of a multisystem society with 
private (domestic as well as foreign) and other (state, 
corporate, and cooperative) sectors on the principles of equal 
rights for all forms of property. The interests of these systems 
will be defended by political parties which, in the end, will 
find their social basis. A democratic state, oriented toward 
the social protection of its citizens, will assume the role of a 
director in the competition of social groups; it will be also 
authorized to soften the ruthlessness and anarchy of the market 
in the period of initial capital accumulation. 
  In the private sector, where the efficiency of labor is 
higher (as well as the exploitation of hired workers), wages 
will be higher, as well. At state enterprises, work will be 
easier and the level of social protection will be higher, but 
wages -- lower. This does not represent any discrimination, 
because even in the most democratic societies people are born 
with equal rights, but with different possibilities, talents, 
and capabilities of intensive work. One thing must be 
guaranteed -- the man should have the right to choose, while the 
state has to safeguard this right in all its aspects. 
  Such an idea of Ukraine's own way can be productive during 
an 
interim, stabilization period, when the idea of socialism has 
already lost its former charm, whereas the idea of capitalism 
still looms. However, one should take pains to prevent this 
idea from assuming a grotesque "all-Ukrainian" form, which would 
evoke a negative reaction on the part of other ethnic groups in 
our state and discredit the Ukrainian idea in general. 
  We should get rid of that peculiar complex of isolationism 
and mistaken treatment of independence, which were born by the 
long period when our national pride was hurt. We should get rid 
of that "independenceness" which continues to fence us off from 
the world with a wall of parochial egoism and spiritual 
outmodedness. It is necessary to make way for a qualitatively 
new level of consciousness of a statesman advocating 
independence -- this man should not be afraid of 
self-realization in the processes of global and regional 
integration in the sphere of business, social activity, and 
culture. 
  Only the implementation of the slogan "Ukraine without 
hirelings is a Ukraine of proprietors" can, in the end, 
safeguard decency and order in the privatization process, and 
henceforth -- trust in the forces of our people and the might of 
our state. It has already become proverbial that the foundation 
of any state is, in the first place, the so-called middle class. 
  These circumstances will not be created by themselves, 
whereas the inactivity of the state, incapable of choosing its 
own course, as we all see, leads to social chaos. The signs of 
a catastrophic situation of the Ukrainian economy are increasing 
in number; this jeopardizes the political gains of independence 
and the very possibility of advancing toward a civilized 
society. The situation of a "wild market," in which, owing to 
financial machinations, "fat cats" are making their fortunes, is 
a challenge for the worker who attaches the improvement of 
living to honest and competent work as well as to the desire to 
live in a society guided by human values. 
  Ukraine can be led out of the crisis only by millions of 
farmers, workers of industry, health care, science, education, 
and culture, as well as by civilized entrepreneurs whose honest 
work should have been morally and materially stimulated by the 
state long ago. For the time being, the reforms have not 
activated this principal source of national revival; they did 
not produce a stimuli for investments in the development of 
production as well as in undertaking activities in industry; 
they did not persuade common people to work honestly and with 
full commitment. 
  This is why I do not have the least doubt that wide segments 
of the population will support the slogan of "law and order." 
Moreover, to clamber out of the abyss of Mafia-like anarchy, the 
people will demand the introduction of firmer forms of state 
life with a high level of personalized responsibility at all 
levels of power. 
  Such is the demand of the interim period. 
  Without safeguarding these circumstances, there will be no 
civilized Ukraine. This has been, and remains, my stance.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in 
Ukrainian at 1200 GMT on 23 June broadcasts a 16-minute election 
broadcast by Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Council 
and candidate in the presidential elections. He begins by 
asking listeners to vote for the candidate who spoke the truth 
irrespective of whether it is convenient or not. He says that 
he has never changed his views for the sake of personal gain. 
  Speaking about the kind of state he wants to build, 
Oleksandr 
Moroz says: "We should build a strong, flourishing, and 
democratic state in which its citizens will be proud of their 
citizenship regardless of where they are. This will not be 
easy, because all the negative things that you are experiencing 
in your lives are proof of the complexity of the matter. We are 
talking about the poverty that is being felt today by the 
majority of the population, the crippled fate of many people, 
the disrespect on the part of the state toward veterans, 
pensioners, those who fought in the war, and invalids. I 
experienced these difficulties over the course of many years and 
would like to say that the highest officials in the state should 
care first and foremost for those people who cannot look after 
themselves." 
  He goes on to say that as regards the others the state 
should 
create the right conditions for them to be able to realize their 
potential. He says that the majority of people do not have this 
possibility: "This means that the policy of the state's 
development, which the authorities chose in the last few years, 
has not completely corresponded to the interests of the people. 
I would even say that it does not correspond to the interests 
of the people to an even bigger extent, and undoubtedly this 
policy must be changed." 
  Speaking on the economy, Oleksandr Moroz said that priority 
must be given to restructuring and to encouraging enterprises to 
produce for export as well as to produce goods for the 
population: "You will agree with me that today such goods are 
food products." He added that the right infrastructure must 
also be created. He makes a special appeal to Ukraine's youth, 
students, and young people in general: "It is not easy for you 
today. There is an easy temptation to go into business, to make 
some money, and by doing so to support one's independence 
economically. It is possible to understand you because the 
state created no other conditions, but it should create them in 
order for you to be guaranteed your independence for your entire 
lives and not only in this difficult stage of transition. This 
guarantee should be based on new jobs, new labor relations, and 
on the opportunity to earn a living worthy of you." 
  Moroz says that during his election campaign he has visited 
many enterprises and organizations and was asked the same 
question everywhere which was difficult to reply to: "This 
question is connected with whether there will be work for 
tomorrow, why are enterprises stopping production, how can one 
live on such a paltry wage, will apartments be built, will the 
housing waiting lists be made longer or will they be reduced, 
will there be social guarantees for free education, labor, 
health care, cultural achievements, and so on and so forth? 
People are worried by simple everyday problems and it is 
difficult for me to give a reply today but the state must reply 
to these questions because otherwise there will be no trust in 
the state." 
  Speaking on the Chernobyl problem, Oleksandr Moroz says it 
is 
not simply a Ukrainian problem but a problem for the whole 
world. On nuclear weapons he says: "We gave a unique example 
to the world of how to solve the problem of civilization. We 
are the only country in the world, throughout its history, that 
took specific steps to reduce military security, particularly 
nuclear security." 
  Concluding his election broadcast on Ukrainian radio, 
Oleksandr Moroz says: "I hope that those who are still undecided 
today will not be frightened by my views or by my candidacy. 
Dear compatriots, what I support today I supported two and even 
three years ago. What I warned you against has now become 
reality and you see it around you and in your families. This 
should elicit fear and some thoughts as to which candidate to 
support. On 26 June we are not just electing a president. Look 
at who is fighting for deputies' mandates at the local level, at 
rayon and oblast councils, and the city of Kiev and why." He 
adds: "Think before you cast your vote and come without fail to 
the elections. It is an exceptionally important matter for 
society. Once again I would like to stress that I believe that 
we will build a strong Ukrainian state which is respected in the 
world, but in order to do this we need a joint political will

equal, that we have one motherland and that we can only build it 
if we build it for all who live here."

  [Text] Sumy [no date as received] -- An unprecedented 
incident has taken place here: five days before the elections 
Vasyl Spivak, head of the district electoral committee for the 
election of chairmen and deputies to the oblast council, 
informed Viktor Kazban, chairman of the oblast's "Prosvita" 
organization, that he is cancelling a decision by the 
[electoral] commission to register 30 candidates from this 
organization as deputies to the oblast council. 
  The formal reason for this is a letter from Konotop in which 
the author, indignant that "Prosvita" is supporting a Jew by 
nationality as a candidate in the elections to the oblast 
council, demanded that the district commission check the 
accuracy of the nomination of all the candidates in general. 
Having demanding all the documents in general from "Prosvita", 
not only those concerning the nomination of candidates but those 
dating back to the time when the organization was founded, Vasyl 
Spivak found some violations, in particular that some adopted 
changes had not been written in the organization's statute. On 
this basis, he issued an instruction to the polling station 
commissions to delete the "Prosvita" candidates from the ballot 
forms. 
  The oblast "Prosvita" organization and all national 
democratic parties sent letters of protest to the oblast 
procuracy and demanded that Vasyl Spivak annul the illegal 
instruction. The statement from the national democratic forces 
in Sumy oblast reads that if he refuses, they will reserve the 
right to turn for help to all national democratic forces in 
Ukraine as well as to resort to actions of civil disobedience.

  [Text] Simferopol, 23 June -- The session of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea continued its work. The deputies considered a 
series of decrees by the president of Crimea on transferring the 
property of the Republic of Crimea under the jurisdiction of the 
government. The majority of the deputies criticized these 
decrees saying that they go contrary to the legislation of 
Crimea and Ukraine. Crimean Communists' leader Leonid Hrach 
accused Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov of his desire to "pay 
for the victory at the elections with the property of Crimea and 
involve people in a war among the mafia clans." On the other 
side, Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov and his supporters at the 
Supreme Council demanded that the members of parliament "fulfill 
people's will," that the decrees be approved and no obstacles be 
put in the way of the executive authorities. The proposed 
variant of the resolution did not receive the sufficient number 
of votes during the voting and was sent to be wored up. 
  After this the deputies considered the draft law "On the 
Fulfillment of the Constitution and the Laws of the Republic of 
Crimea." The discussion of this issue evoked a negative 
response on the part of Yuriy Meshkov. Since the draft law 
seriously restricted the plenary powers of the president of 
Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov declared that part of the deputies had an 
intention "to embark of the road of confrontation between the 
Supreme Council and the president." During the voting this 
draft law also failed to receive the sufficient number of votes 
and was sent to be worked up. 
  Afterwards the deputies adopted "a resolution on measures to 
stabilize agriculture in Crimea in 1994 and 1995 and on the 
program for reforming the agro-industrial complex of Crimea." A 
commission was formed at the session to study the issue on the 
status of the city of Sevastopol. At the end of the sitting a 
whole number of deputies criticized president Yuriy Meshkov for 
his tactlessness and insults to the deputies during the session. 
  The next sitting of the Supreme Council of Crimea will take 
place on 29 June.

  [Text] President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov has described as 
unacceptable and provocative parliamentary discussions of a bill 
intended to suspend the presidency law until a local 
Constitutional Court has been formed. 
  The bill put on the agenda of a parliamentary session in 
Simferopol on Thursday [23 June] follows a resolution of 14 June 
stating that many of the president's decrees were out of line 
with Crimean legislation. 
  Speaking in parliament, Meshkov said the Supreme Soviet was 
out for a stand off with the president under the mask of demands 
for compliance with the Constitution and laws. He said the 
current situation was far too serious to raise the question of 
stripping him of presidential powers. 
  Meshkov sees the parliament's action as an attempt to try to 
put itself above the people of Crimea who elected him as head of 
state in keeping with the Constitution. 
  However, the deputies are most likely to pass the law, 
albeit 
in a softer form, leader of the Crimean Tatars' faction in 
parliament Refat Chubarov told INTERFAX-Ukraine. He described 
what was happening as an attempt by the Russia faction which 
backed up Meshkov during the presidential election to put him in 
his place. 
  As discussion continues, a conciliatory group was elected to 
work out a final resolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Ukrainian prime minister Leonid </F>
Kuchma by Albert Nechiporenko; place and date not given: 
"Nothing to Choose Between the Languages. Leonid Kuchma on the 
Crimea Problem"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the presidential election in Ukraine, 
former premier Leonid Kuchma's ratings are rising rapidly. 
Would-be voters are attracted by his program's specific 
proposals on most of the problems of concern to Ukrainian 
citizens. Including his proposals on the Crimea issue. 
  [Nechiporenko] Leonid Danilovich, events in and around the 
Crimea are threatening to scupper peace in Ukraine. What is 
your opinion of the Crimean conflict? 
  [Kuchma] Many people are trying to present the Crimea's 
desire for independence as a consequence of the activity of 
pro-Russian political forces in the region. Undoubtedly, such 
forces do exist there. But it is an intolerable 
oversimplification to reduce everything to a question of how 
much effort is put in. After all, the elections for the 
president and the Crimean Supreme Council showed that most of 
the population support the Crimean leadership's current policy 
and its desire to solve its problems independently. 
  [Nechiporenko] What is the main cause of the increased 
tension in the Crimea? 
  [Kuchma] I am profoundly convinced that the tension over the 
peninsula is being fed by the general crisis in Ukraine. We 
have to be self-critical enough to declare the two main factors 
which are pushing the Crimea away from Ukraine: 
  The first is the self-destruction of the Ukrainian economy. 
  The second factor is the politics. If we do not accept 
regional bilingualism and if we fail to halt the national 
radicalization of history, art, and education, then we will have 
some acute conflicts in other parts of Ukraine as well....

  [Text] Our correspondent has met at Boryspil airport with 
a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation headed by Oleksandr 
Tkachenko, first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council. The 
Ukrainian parliamentarians returned today after participating in 
a session of the Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest. 
Among those who met the delegation at the airport was Romanian 
Ambassador to Ukraine Ion Bistreanu. Now, let us listen to an 
interview with Oleksandr Mykolayovych Tkachenko, conducted 
immediately after the delegation's arrival. 
  [Begin Tkachenko recording] The assembly of nine European 
and Asian states aims at uniting their efforts after the Council 
for Mutual Economic Assistance ceased to exist. We believe that 
Ukraine has made a correct step by joining the Black Sea 
Assembly. The topics discussed at this session, and it was 
already the third one, primarily concerned economic issues, as 
well as the role and place of Ukraine among other states [words 
indistinct]. The third topic discussed concerned cultural and 
social ties among our states. In addition to these nine states, 
Bulgaria and Greece were invited to participate in the Black 
Sea Assembly session as observers, and we believe that they will 
join this organization in the near future. 
  We believe that the Ukrainian delegation accomplished its 
mission, because we defended our position, which envisions that 
the next assembly session will be chaired by Supreme Council 
Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. [Words indistinct] Ukraine will be 
chairing the assembly during this period. [end recording]

VYBIR correspondent; place and date not given: "It Is Worthless

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [VYBIR] Will Ukraine sign an 
agreement on economic union [with Russia]? 
  [Masol] All states sign certain agreements on economic 
unions or common markets. I want to state that we will not be 
able to live and work without a common market. 
  [VYBIR] Thus, will Ukraine be an associate or full member of 
the European Union? 
  [Masol] Let us put it differently. To buy energy resources 
and other products in Russia, we should also sell something 
there. You can refer to this as you want -- even as an economic 
union. [passage omitted] 
  [VYBIR] Who is our main partner in the West? 
  [Masol] These are Germany, France, Great Britain, and 
Austria. We should have friendly relations with all Western 
countries, provided they are interested in developing mutually 
beneficial relations with us. [passage omitted] 
  [VYBIR] What is your attitude toward free trade unions? 
  [Masol] There must be trade unions. Yet, they should keep 
in mind that the most important thing is that everyone works. 
People must work and earn money. However, if trade unions only 
take care of wages, it will be hard to reach an understanding.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has 
welcomed Russia's joining of the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program. He was speaking at a news conference in Kiev on 
Thursday [23 June]. 
  Concerning Ukraine's participation in the NATO program 
Radetskyy said that the Ukrainian army was going to participate 
in several NATO exercises within the framework of military 
cooperation. For instance, one company will take part in an 
exercise in the United States and one platoon will be involved 
in an exercise in Belgium this autumn. 
  Ukraine joined NATO's program last February. Radetskyy said 
that financial constraints were the sole brake on contacts under 
the Partnership for Peace plan. 
  Radetskyy was evasive when asked about statements by the 
Ukrainian parliamentary speaker that a joint command of the 
Ukrainian and Russian fleets in the Black Sea was a possibility. 
  Radetskyy believes that the Black Sea Fleet problem is the 
business of governments and parliaments while "the military must 
execute decisions made."

  [Text] Kiev, 23 Jun -- Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman 
Aleksandr Moroz has said that he sees a solution to the problem 
of the Black Sea Fleet in an arrangement whereby Russia and 
Ukraine will execute joint command of the fleet but each side 
would be responsible for the financial and organizational 
aspects of running its share of the fleet. He said so at a news 
conference today. 
  The Supreme Council head said that Ukraine's agreements with 
the CIS countries ought to be deepened because they are not 
working at the moment and no one is trying to make them work. 
He said he was concerned with the fact that the world community 
was attempting to turn Ukraine into an appendage supplying raw 
resources, and spoke in favor of setting up and developing 
self-contained production cycles in the state, which would meet 
Ukraine's demand for the main types of industrial products.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- On 22 June the 
Ukrainian Naval Forces' press center announced that some of the 
mass media circulated reports by the Black Sea Fleet press 
center to the effect that "addressing the electorate of the city 
of Donetsk, Ukraine's Supreme Council Speaker Oleksandr Moroz 
spoke out for a single Black Sea Fleet, which should serve the 
interests of the fraternal peoples of Ukraine and Russia." It 
was also reported that Oleksandr Moroz believed the Black Sea 
Fleet should be commanded jointly, following NATO's example. 
  The Ukrainian Naval Forces' press center declares that the 
Black Sea Fleet press center's report grossly distorts the 
meaning of the statement made by Ukraine's Supreme Council 
chairman concerning the solution of the Black Sea Fleet issue. 
In Donetsk Oleksandr Moroz spoke out in favor of setting up a 
united command of the Ukrainian and Russian fleets on the Black 
Sea. At the same time he emphasized that "this command should 
be united, not a joint one." 
  The Ukrainian Naval Forces command believes that the 
leadership of the Black Sea Fleet thus, mistakes the wish for 
the reality and reiterates that the negotiating process on the 
Black Sea Fleet division is continuing at the governmental level 
at which both sides point out unequivocally that the fleet must 
be divided.

  [Text] Yerevan ("HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN", RESPUBLICA 
ARMENIA" dailies), 06/23/94--Yesterday the Armenian delegation, 
headed by the Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan, returned from 
Switzerland, where it has been participating in an international 
economy congress in Krans-Montana. 
  Governmental delegations of 34 Eastern European and Asian 
countries, representatives of large Western commercial, 
financial, industrial and bank organizations participated in the 
congress. It's goal was to support development of relations 
between European and Asian countries through private contacts 
between politicians and economists. 
  During a meeting, dedicated to Armenia, RA [Republic of 
Armenia] Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan analyzed the political 
and economic situations in the country, problems of foreign 
trade and a number of problems concerning financial and banking 
systems in Armenia. He also had a number of working and 
confidential meetings with heads of official delegations of a 
number of countries and representatives of large Western 
companies. 
  During a meeting with the Chairman of the Congress Jean-Paul 
Carterand the sides discussed the problems of Armenia's further 
collaboration with the congress, particularly, organization of a 
special session, dedicated to Armenia. Several aspects of the 
socio-economic state in Armenia have also been discussed. 
  Grant Bagratyan also met Federal Chancellor of Switzerland, 
Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Jean-Pascal Delamuraz. 
The sides discussed formation and development of relations 
between Armenia and Switzerland. Mr. Delamuraz expressed 
interest to the political situation in the region and position 
of Armenia regarding the peace process. 
  A theme of separate discussions was the attitude of 
Switzerland to the programs of International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank, concerning Armenia. Since Armenia and 
Azerbaijan belong to one group, Armenian prime minister 
suggested Switzerland to be positive regarding economic programs 
both in Armenia and Azerbaijan despite the relations between the 
two countries. Mr. Bagratyan also asked to include Armenia in 
the list of countries, which Switzerland is going to render aid 
in the coming year.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibragim Shukurov: "Peace Policy: Results of the </F>
Working Visit of Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev to Turkey 
9-10 June"] 
  [Text] Istanbul-Baku--Istanbul is a giant maze of 
streets, pierced, like steel needles, by bridges, avenues, and 
expressways. A city in which two continents are neighbors and 
the elemental forces of two seas meet.... Only from a birds' eye 
view did it acquire for me the clarity and completeness of its 
quaintly subdividing formation. Looking out the aircraft window 
at Istanbul, which was turning pinkish in the rays of the 
setting sun, I finally understood where was Asia, and where was 
Europe, where the Black Sea, and where the Sea of Marmora, where 
the Bosphorus, and where the Golden Horn.... Truly, great things 
are seen from afar! 
  The dimensions of the working visit to Turkey of 
Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev also revealed themselves in 
all their fullness after a certain interval of time. It was 
later, in Baku, when a number of important summit meetings had 
been held, that the import and the logic of the visit become 
clear. 
  The most complex situation that has come about in Azerbaijan 
as a result of the Armenian aggression, the search for ways to 
achieve a just and all-embracing peace, the return of the 
occupied territories to the bosom of Azerbaijan, and the 
creation of sure guarantees of the safety of the peaceful 
population in these parts, the settlement of certain questions 
of military cooperation with Russia, and the strengthening of 
partner relations with countries of East and West, which implies 
not only political alliances but also the realization of joint 
economic projects--this in summarized form constituted the 
purposes and tasks of Geydar Aliyev's visit to Turkey. 
  It was truly a working visit, in the sense that it was 
filled 
to the maximum with meetings, conversations, and consultations 
on the most important policy issues. 
  The work began at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, even, where 
the 
president of Azerbaijan was met by Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel. The leaders of the two countries issued a statement for 
journalists representing newspapers and agencies of Turkey, 
Azerbaijan, and a number of other countries. 
  Both leaders noted how great the danger of an expansion of 
the boundaries of the military conflict unleashed by Armenia 
was. According to Geydar Aliyev, its inordinate territorial 
claims are creating a threat to peace and security throughout 
the region. Today the focal point of the war is blazing in 
Azerbaijan, but there is no guarantee that it will not tomorrow 
spread to contiguous countries. In this situation not only 
Azerbaijan but all states of the region are concerned to see a 
stimulation of the efforts of the CSCE and other European and 
international organizations aimed at interdicting the aggressor. 
  This speech to the journalists set the tone for the whole 
series of Geydar Aliyev's meetings, which took place at a time 
when the North Atlantic Cooperation Council was in session. The 
city on the Bosphorus was greeting many important guests at that 
time. An Azerbaijani delegation, headed by Foreign Minister 
Gasan Gasanov had also arrived for a CSCE [as published] Council 
session. 
  Politicians of many countries sought meetings with Geydar 
Aliyev. The limited time of his stay in Turkey constricted, 
naturally, the range of persons with whom the leader of the 
republic had a dialogue. But the choice of partners was not 
fortuitous, it was dictated by both tactical and strategic tasks 
of grand policy. 
  On the first day of his stay in Turkey, the president of 
Azerbaijan received at his residence in the Sheraton Hotel 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who had initiated the 
meeting. They dealt with the situation in the zone of combat 
operations, problems of a humanitarian nature, and the prospects 
of cooperation in the economy, particularly in the oil industry. 
Both sides emphasized the importance of contacts and the 
continuation of political consultations for the resolution of 
Azerbaijan's main problem--a winding down of hostilities on the 
territory of the republic, the restoration of peace, and 
people's return to their native haunts. Peace in the region is 
the goal and the condition and the means of Azerbaijan's 
cooperation with foreign countries. 
  The same day the president met with Gen. Dogan Gures, chief 
of the General Staff of Turkey's armed forces. 
  The second day of the visit contained a full program. At 
nine 
in the morning the president met in his rooms Swedish Foreign 
Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. Geydar Aliyev greeted his guest 
warmly. He said, in particular, that he valued highly her work 
as chairman of the CSCE and her efforts for a settlement of the 
Armenian- Azerbaijani conflict. 
  "The problems have, unfortunately, become even more 
complex," 
Geydar Aliyev said, "but I am once again counting on the support 
of the CSCE. I hope that the authority that you have gained in 
Europe and the efforts of your compatriot Jan Eliasson, who is 
currently head of the Minsk Group, will permit the achievement 
of the desired results." 
  Margaretha af Ugglas thanked Geydar Aliyev for the high 
evaluation of her work as leader of the CSCE. She said that she 
was pleased to have the meeting and recalled with great 
satisfaction her stay in Baku. "I realize," she declared, "that 
not all problems have been resolved, but I am reassured by the 
fact that the Minsk Group is headed by the experienced diplomat 
Eliasson. He is in productive contact not only with both sides 
but also with Moscow, where he recently held important meetings." 
  A key event of the program of President Geydar Aliyev's 
visit 
was his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
It took place at the Ciragan Hotel, in which the session of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council was being held at this time. 
  Experienced politicians, Geydar Aliyev and Warren 
Christopher, having exchanged greetings and pleasantries, 
immediately got down to an ascertainment of positions in the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. President Geydar Aliyev 
enumerated the problems that Azerbaijan had encountered in the 
course of the Armenian aggression that has been going on for six 
years now. He said that as a result of the Armenian offensive, 
20 percent of Azerbaijani territory had been occupied and that 
the republic had 1.2 million refugees. 
  "I believe," Geydar Aliyev said, "that the war should be 
brought to an end. Since I became president, I have sought a 
settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. We have cooperated 
with the CSCE and its Minsk Group and with the United Nations 
from the very outset. As you know, the Security Council has 
adopted four resolutions demanding an immediate withdrawal of 
forces from the captured Azerbaijani territory. The Armenian 
side is not complying with these resolutions. I would like to be 
completely sincere: The hopes that we placed in the CSCE have 
yet to be justified. The Minsk Group has been unable in four 
years, unfortunately, to do anything of substance. 
  "We would like to see a stimulation of the activity of the 
CSCE and the Minsk Group and are very much counting on the 
support of the United States here. It seems to me that a 
principal condition of a settlement of the conflict is the 
active position of the United States in untying its knots." 
  In his answering remarks, Warren Christopher thanked Geydar 
Aliyev for the information and for the "graphic," as he put it, 
presentation of the picture of the conflict. The secretary of 
state observed that the United States supported Azerbaijan's 
peace initiatives. The leadership of his country was impressed 
by the fact that the republic was working with the CSCE and was 
helping realize the peacemaking program being undertaken by this 
organization. "We will always support your commitment to the 
CSCE," Warren Christopher declared. 
  He sounded out Azerbaijan's readiness to agree, up to 
certain 
limits, to compromise and could see for himself that our peace 
initiatives are not an empty declaration, they are backed by 
practical actions, which could in the future be even more 
vigorous. W. Christopher emphasized the importance for a 
strengthening of Azerbaijan's economy of the signing of the oil 
contracts. Concluding the conversation, W. Christopher assured 
the leader of Azerbaijan that the United States would do 
everything to ensure that the conferees and interested parties 
operate within the framework of international standards. 
  The foreign ministers of Turkey and Azerbaijan--Hikmet Cetin 
and Gasan Gasanov--and state counselors Vafa Gulizade and Gabil 
Guseynli took part in the meeting. 
  Ninety minutes later there was a meeting in the same hotel 
with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. It pursued the 
accomplishment of a two-in-one task: on the one hand outlining a 
program of cooperation with Greece, and on the other, entering 
into contact with the European Union, of which this country is 
the chairman. 
  "Our states," Geydar Aliyev said, opening the meeting, "have 
good prospects for the development of bilateral relations. 
Considering their geopolitical location, climatic features, and 
historical traditions, Azerbaijan and Greece have good 
opportunities for fruitful cooperation. It has long been time to 
determine spheres of partnership and prepare the corresponding 
documents." 
  Touching on the subject of the Armenian-Azerbaijani 
conflict, 
the president said that it is attended by great sacrifices. They 
are being borne, in the main, by Azerbaijan, on whose territory 
the hostilities are taking place. 
  "Our goal," Geydar Aliyev emphasized, "is to achieve a 
ceasefire and the liberation of the captured territories. The 
European Union could, in our view, play its part in a settlement 
of the conflict. We want all countries to have objective 
information on what is happening in the region. Unfortunately, 
outside of it the majority believes that both parties to this 
conflict are equally to blame. It is extraordinarily important 
for us in this situation that the world community know who is 
the aggressor, and who the victim. We are counting on your help 
here." 
  Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias agreed with Geydar 
Aliyev that the European Union could reinforce the potential of 
the peacekeeping force operating in the region. 
  "The European Union, like Greece also," Karolos Papoulias 
declared, "has always been a supporter of disputed questions 
being solved at the negotiating table, not with violence. We 
cannot be indifferent to the problems of refugees and offer our 
services for a halt to an escalation of the conflict. Greece, as 
a sovereign state and as the country that heads the European 
Union, is ready to cooperate with Azerbaijan." 
  The search for partners that could help stop the millstones 
of war and bring back peace to the lacerated land defined also 
the work in Istanbul of Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov. He had a constructive dialogue with FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, who expressed hope for a stimulation of 
efforts for the speediest resolution of the bloody conflict. He 
conveyed to G. Gasanov a package of documents that are being 
prepared for signature by the NATO partners. Gasan Gasanov's 
speech at the session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council 
was harmoniously interwoven into the political context of the 
president of Azerbaijan's visit. 
  This speech made it possible once again to contrast the two 
concepts of a settlement of the conflict: the Azerbaijani 
concept, based on a just peace and a stabilization of the 
situation throughout the region and the assurance of guarantees 
of security and tranquillity for all, and the Armenian concept, 
which is imbued with a spirit of annexationism and national 
egocentrism and pursues the goal of digging in at all costs on 
territory that has been seized by force. 
  "Twenty countries have subscribed to the Partnership for 
Peace program, and this proves the viability of its underlying 
principles and ideas," G. Gasanov said in his speech. "The 
Azerbaijani Republic, which was among the first to subscribe to 
the program, attaches great significance to the Partnership, 
seeing in it big opportunities for influencing the present 
situation in my country. 
  "Azerbaijan has shown in practice repeatedly its commitment 
to the principles of a peaceful settlement of conflicts. It 
advocates a solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict from 
the position of the commonly accepted international standards, 
specifying the observance of states' sovereignty and territorial 
integrity and the sanctity of their borders and respect for 
human rights. But all our efforts to find a peaceful way out of 
the deadlocked conflict are running into the power barrier of 
the aggressor. 
  "Flouting the rules of international law, Armenia is 
pursuing 
a policy of fait accompli in respect to the occupied Azerbaijani 
territories. It needs the negotiating process solely to gain 
time, which is being used to increase its military presence, dig 
in on the occupied Azerbaijani territory, and expand deep into 
Azerbaijan." 
  War and peace in the region, who benefits from an escalation 
of the conflict, and the political calculations, for which the 
people are paying in blood, were the subject also of the meeting 
between Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller, which was held at the Yildiz Kosk 
residence. This meeting concluded the program of the visit and 
summed up, as it were, all that had been done in this time. 
  Geydar Aliyev focused attention in the conversation on the 
threat of an increase in military and political pressure on 
Azerbaijan and on the attempt of certain circles to stymie the 
negotiating process and isolate the republic from the assistance 
of European and international organizations. 
  Tansu Ciller listened closely to Geydar Aliyev and promised 
all- around support for all Azerbaijan's peace initiatives. 
  There is no doubt that the meeting of Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev and the work of the Azerbaijani delegation at the 
session of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council in Istanbul 
made obvious and irrefutable for our actual and potential 
partners the truth that Azerbaijan aspires to peace and harmony 
in the region and calls on Armenia to do likewise. Having fallen 
victim to unprecedented aggression, our republic nonetheless 
does not thirst for revenge, but is displaying the initiative 
for the suppression, finally, by joint efforts of the 
conflagration of war. 
  In our view, the main result of President Geydar Aliyev's 
visit to Turkey is that the world community was shown once again 
the good will of Azerbaijan and its sincere aspiration to a 
termination of the senseless war and to peace as the sole 
possibility of human existence.

  [Text] Sochi, 24 Jun -- Engineering work has been completed 
at the sites where the peacekeeping forces are to be deployed 
along the line of confrontation of the Georgian and Abkhazian 
armed formations. A total of 11 posts have been equipped, five 
of them are situated in the area of the Inguri GES 
[hydroelectric power station], and three near the town of Gali. 
ITAR-TASS learned this at the Abkhazian Press and Information 
Ministry, which quoted reports released by the joint command of 
the peacekeeping forces. According to the source, all routes for 
troop movements have been cleared of mines and a checkpoint on a 
bridge across the Inguri river has started to operate. 
  The headquarters of the peacekeeping forces are situated in 
Galskiy and Zugdidskiy Rayons of Abkhazia.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Chernov: "Peacemaking in Abkhazia"] </F>
  [Text] Sukhumi-Sochi -- It looks as if 26 June has been 
set as the latest official date for the start of peacekeeping 
operations in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. All news 
agencies have been informed that Russian military units, which 
are due to take up positions between the warring sides' armed 
formations in the next two-three days, have started moving into 
Abkhazia. Reports on the specific timing of the introduction of 
peacemakers started circulating after the Federation Council, at 
its 21 June sitting behind closed doors, adopted a decision on 
the use of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations in Abkhazia 
and ratified the relevant presidential edict. According to 
Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, the military 
perceived this decision as an order to act. 
  In fact, the Russian military have been in action in 
Abkhazia 
since August 1992. On the eve of the official introduction of 
peacemakers in the conflict zone, it would be apt to recall that 
military pilots from Russian Air Force subunits based at Gudauta 
airfield and servicemen from the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment 
transferred from Ganja to Gudauta have been inside this zone 
since the very start of the Georgian-Abkhazian war. For almost 
two years they have performed the functions of peacemakers: 
Transporting people out of the fire zone, helping thousands of 
refugees, and -- mainly -- restraining the adversaries by their 
presence and preventing them from applying scorched-earth 
tactics. 
  At present the soldiers and officers of the 345th Airborne 
Assault Regiment, together with paratroopers from the Volga and 
Leningrad Military Districts, are preparing to take up positions 
along the Inguri River. Incidentally, the movement of 
paratroopers, military construction personnel, sappers, 
communications specialists, and their equipment to Gudauta had 
already started by the end of May (TRUD reported this in its 2 
June 1994 issue). The first subunits arrived in Abkhazia at 
that time for the purpose of carrying out serious preparatory 
work -- deploying the staff of the peacemaking forces and their 
control and command posts, organizing communications, defusing 
tens of thousands of mines and demolition charges, repairing 
eight bridges.... All the signs indicated that the Russian 
peacemakers intend to deploy in Abkhazia and the border region 
of western Georgia in depth and for a long time. 
  Even a press center has been set up for the Russian 
peacemaking forces. Its staffers said that preparatory work has 
been almost completed and checkpoints will soon start operating 
on the highway bridge across the Inguri River along which the 
Georgian-Abkhazian border runs and which, until very recently, 
has been the dividing line between the adversaries. There are 
plans to set up a total of 50 permanent Army checkpoints in the 
conflict zone. The total number of Russian "blue helmets" in 
Abkhazia will reach 3,000 men. 
  If truth be said, the Federation Council's decision to use 
Russian troops in peacekeeping operations was accepted as a 
necessary formality in Sukhumi. Nobody here had any doubt that 
the decision would be positive, seeing that the plan for the 
separation of the sides and the introduction of "blue helmets" 
was already being practically implemented by 21 June. In 
accordance with this plan, elaborated and agreed by the 
Abkhazian and Georgian military with mediation from Russian 
Defense Ministry officers, the region along the Inguri River is 
declared a security zone. The zone is 24 km wide (12 km on each 
side of the river). All armed formations, together with their 
combat equipment of course, will be completely withdrawn from 
the zone. The Georgian and Abkhazian positions will come under 
the peacemaking forces' control. The plan provides that areas 
adjacent to the security zone will be restricted armaments zones 
-- areas where the adversaries' military units may be stationed 
but without heavy combat equipment. Thus, once the "blue 
helmets" have been introduced, the warring sides will find 
themselves at a distance in excess of the maximum fire range of 
the most powerful artillery systems at their disposal. 
  The problem of the Kodor Gorge, the scene of heavy fighting 
on several occasions this year, has been resolved and, 
hopefully, permanently: Under the plan for the separation of 
the sides, all Georgian formations in the gorge will be 
withdrawn outside Abkhazia, while regular patrols by peacemakers 
and UN military observers will operate in population centers 
along the banks of the Kodor River. 
  What will the Russian paratroopers be doing in Abkhazia? 
Major General Vasiliy Yakushev, commander of peacemaking 
operations in the conflict zone, explained that the tasks facing 
the peacemakers stem from the Agreement on Cease-Fire and 
Separation of the Sides, which was signed by representatives of 
Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia, and the United Nations in Moscow 14 
June. The document clearly states that the peacemakers' task is 
to monitor the unconditional observance of the cease-fire. In 
the event of threatened attack against peacemaking subunits, and 
especially in the event of direct attack, they have the right to 
take appropriate self-defense measures. 
  Of course, one of the main purposes of the introduction of 
peacemaking forces in Abkhazia is to create conditions for the 
return of refugees and displaced persons to the republic. So 
far, however, the refugees who are impatiently awaiting 
permission to return home, have no cause to rejoice: The finer 
details of the procedure for registration and repatriation of 
people have yet to be worked out. In my view, the commission 
whose task it is to tackle the problems of the refugees' 
repatriation will encounter serious complications: I saw no 
vacant homes during my visit to Galskiy Rayon. They are 
occupied by people whose homes have been destroyed. Where will 
they be housed if the homes have to be vacated for their former 
occupants? 
  On the whole, however, the introduction of Russian 
peacemaking forces in the Inguri River region is accepted in 
Abkhazia calmly, without any fuss. Or, to put it more 
accurately, with less fuss than in Russia. People here realize 
that the peacemakers will not eliminate the causes which made 
the war flare out. According to Abkhazian politicians, the 
unrecognized republic will have to live for a long time to come 
in conditions of frozen conflict and uncertain political status. 
But this is of course better than existing on the brink of 
death.

  [Text] Sochi, 23 Jun -- The Georgian and Abkhazian sides 
will ask the peacekeeping forces to speed up the mine clearing 
operations in the area where the pylons of the Inguri GES 
[hydroelectric power station] power transmission lines are 
situated. The pylons have been damaged as a result of recent 
subversive operations. 
  Feliks Kovalev, Russian special envoy, told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today that an accord to this effect was reached in 
the course of the second session of the Georgian-Abkhazian 
coordinating commission in charge of economic issues, held with 
the participation of the Russian Federation and UN 
representatives in Sochi. 
  "We also asked the Abkhazian delegation to lift the 
restrictions on power supplies for Georgia, introduced by the 
Abkhazian side as part of a package of sanctions," Feliks 
Kovalev further said. 
  The session also examined issues of restoring the power 
supply lines that cross the territory of Abkhazia. According to 
the Russian diplomat, an accord was reached to set up a group of 
experts that will estimate the extent of damage done to the 
power supply lines. 
  According to Feliks Kovalev, "certain difficulties emerged" 
during the discussion of the restoration of through road and 
rail services.

  [Text] Minsk, 24 June -- It has not been possible to 
reveal who will be the first president of the Republic of 
Belarus: Such are the preliminary results of the first round of 
the elections which took place on Thursday [23 June]. 
  And even though the final data will be received later it can 
already be said now that Aleksandr Lukashenko who collected 
44-45 percent of the vote is more than twice ahead of his main 
competitor Vyacheslav Kebich (18-19 per cent). The other 
candidates rank in the following order: Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, Aleksandr Dubo, and Vasiliy Novikov, with the 
leader of the Belarusian People's Front Zenon Poznyak having 
approximately five percent less votes than V.Kebich. 
  Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Aleksandr 
Abramovich said that for the time being three dates for the 
second round are being discussed: 7, 10, or 17 July 1994. In 
accordance with the legislation, Aleksandr Lukashenko and 
Vyacheslav Kebich will be permitted to take part in this round.

<F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, 24 June [date as received] -- More than 77 
percent of the electorate took part in the presidential 
elections in the Republic of Belarus. Announcing the first 
preliminary information to a BELINFORM correspondent, the 
Republic's central electoral commission made one thing clear: 
One can conclude from the data coming in that none of the 
candidates has secured the necessary number of votes. 
  At present, one can only talk of an indicated preference for 
two candidates: About 30-32 percent voted for Aleksandr 
Lukashenko, and 24-26 percent voted for Vyacheslav Kebich. The 
remaining four candidates lag significantly behind, and the 
order of preference for them is: Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, Vasiliy Novikov, and Aleksandr Dubko. 
  The highest voter activity was recorded in Brest oblast, 
where over 83 percent of the eligible citizens went to the 
polling stations. The most passive people were in Minsk, where 
the figure was 69.3 percent. 
  The central electoral commission expects to give the 
preliminary results at about 0700 [0300 GMT] in the morning, 
Moscow time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb, by </F>
Joanna Boczkowska-Crettenand; place and date not given: "Today 
Presidential Elections in Belarus; A Great Unknown"] 
  [Text] [Boczkowska-Cretenand] The first free presidential 
elections will be held in Belarus on 23 June. Can one predict 
the preference of the people? 
  [Hryb] Today it is still difficult to predict which one of 
the six candidates will be elected. The candidates represent 
various political options -- from the extreme left to the 
extreme right; discussions are under way. However, the results 
are a great unknown. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] A few months ago you introduced a new 
Constitution in Belarus. How broad will the sphere of powers of 
the new president be? 
  [Hryb] We did introduce the Constitution; however, one 
cannot say that it is new. Before that there was a constitution 
of the Belarusian Soviet Republic. If one speaks about a new 
Constitution, one assumes that there used to be an old one; 
however, since March we have had the first sovereign 
Constitution of Belarus. The president will not be new, either. 
He will have superior representative and executive powers. In 
other words, it will be a strong presidential authority. He 
will be elected by the entire nation. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] If the people elect a president that 
comes from a communist party, what will be the political and 
economic consequences of this? 
  [Hryb] It is hard to tell; however, I think that this will 
cause serious problems. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] What kinds of problems? 
  [Hryb] In relations with the leaders of Eastern and Western 
Europe, as well as the United States. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Can it impede the economic reforms as 
well? 
  [Hryb] It is possible in a way; however, the presidential 
candidate from the communist party claims that his election will 
not affect the continuation of economic reforms. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Are you an advocate of a monetary 
union with Russia? 
  [Hryb] I do not deny that there is a possibility of 
introducing such a union, based on the experiences of the 
European Union, which has been discussing this problem for some 
time now. A monetary union may give many economic advantages. 
However, this issue should still be analyzed. My country does 
not have an answer to this question yet. It is still too early. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] Does Belarus have legislation 
encouraging foreign investments? 
  [Hryb] Yes, it does. These are regulations, enacted in the 
autumn of last year, which concern ownership rights, the law on 
enterprises, on foreign investments and investors. It is a 
whole legislative packet that favors investments. The 
advantageous conditions are known to Polish businessmen 
investing their capital in Belarus. They are under protection, 
and they are making profits. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] You said in Crans Montana that the 
West is imposing restrictive barriers on Belarussian flax. Do 
you think that the West might open its markets more broadly for 
products from Eastern Europe? 
  [Hryb] I think that access to the markets in Europe should 
be free and based on competition. Just like Poles, we would 
also like to have a free market. Why are the countries of rich 
Europe afraid of our poor market, our goods, and our quality? 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] How do you perceive the problem of 
security in our part of Europe? 
  [Hryb] I believe the security problems should be resolved by 
strengthening independence. We should be sovereign and maintain 
good relations with our neighbors. The "Partnership for Peace" 
does not guarantee security to its members. 
  [Boczkowska-Cretenand] However, it is the first step on this 
road... 
  [Hryb] Nevertheless, between the first and the second step 
there is a long distance, and it is not at all certain that the 
second step will be made. The road from the "Partnership" to 
membership in NATO is long. Membership of the East European 
states in NATO will make it even more difficult for this 
organization to make decisions. Therefore, it must change its 
statute. We are not against the "Partnership for Peace"; 
however, first we must solve our economic problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor of Law Yuriy Brovka: "Once Again </F>
About the Notorious Agreement"] 
  [Excerpts] Discussions regarding the supposed merger of 
the monetary systems of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian 
Federation are not subsiding these days. People are wondering: 
Is this unification legal and to what extent is it expedient? 
We will not discuss the economic aspects in detail. Experts 
have already spoken about this issue. You have only to scan 
such periodicals as the Minsk-published BANKOVSKIY VESTNIK, 
NATSIONALNAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA GAZETA, DELO, BELORUSSKAYA 
DELOVAYA GAZETA, BELORUSKIY RYNOK and the Moscow-published 
EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, DELOVOY MIR, and KOMERSANT-DAILY to realize 
just how extremely critical most highly qualified experts in our 
states are of this issue. Obviously, the unrecoverable losses 
for each side will considerably exceed the rather dubious 
advantages. Let us address the legal side of the issue. 
  No one doubts the fact that the agreement -- with additional 
protocols attached to it -- signed in Moscow two months ago 
seriously violates the new Constitution of the Republic of 
Belarus. Only one issue is of importance: What conclusions 
should be made? We know that the General Prosecutor's Office did 
not find anything criminal in the work of our governmental 
delegation. Well, let us assume that, indeed, there was no 
crime in all this, there are no criminal cases to be 
investigated, there is no one against whom legal actions could 
be instituted for having committed intentional crimes. 
Moreover, [Central Bank Chairman] S. Bahdankevich, one of the 
members of our delegation, was cautious and officially disagreed 
with those clauses of the agreement which were obviously 
unconstitutional. Therefore, there is no agreement as such. In 
a word, we can only speak about a sort of misunderstanding 
prompted by the fact that our statesmen have inadequate 
knowledge of their constitutional duties. We should not wonder 
why. The times when the Constitution was less valued than the 
statute of the Communist Party, or even any of the Central 
Committee's instructions, did not go this far. 
  Having not sorted out this issue from the viewpoint of the 
constitutional rights of our state, let us look at it from the 
international-legal viewpoint. [passage omitted] 
  I can only add that international legal experts hold a 
common 
opinion that the norms "jus cogens" [internationally recognized 
laws] are, first of all, the principles recognized by 
international law. Among those principles, the principle 
assuming the sovereign equality of all states is of top 
priority. Therefore, what sovereign equality -- with regard to 
the recent Belarusian-Russian agreements on financial issues -- 
can we speak about?! These agreements do not refer to the 
introduction of a new currency, a new unified ruble, which could 
be used in circulation as single legal tender with two equal 
state emblems or without any symbols at all. These agreements do 
not refer to the setting up of a unified state bank -- with the 
right to print currency -- with two cochairmen adopting joint 
decisions. These agreements do not refer to the use of single 
tariffs to be introduced in accordance with special bilateral 
pacts. No, the point is quite the contrary: To allow a foreign 
state to exercise overall control over the national monetary and 
credit system; to regularly plead for money with foreign 
national symbols; to allow a foreign state and a foreign 
legislature to adopt legal norms -- regulating tariffs, customs 
duties, and so on -- to be observed by us. I do not know, 
perhaps for Tatarstan -- fighting to be granted the status of 
privileged autonomy within the Russian Federation -- such an 
agreement could be a definite step forward, but as for the 
Republic of Belarus, this, of course, is, no doubt, a step 
backwards on the path to the so-called "autonomy" which was long 
ago proposed by Stalin. Evidently, such agreements would not 
raise the authority of either Belarus or Russia in international 
arena. It is obvious that -- sooner or later -- such an 
agreement will be considered illegal "ab initio" with all the 
subsequent consequences. 
  One more thing: I cannot help but wonder, looking at those 
people -- war veterans and representatives of the influential 
directorial corps -- who support the so-called "socialist 
choice." On what do they count? Do they really count on the 
quick removal of Russian President B. Yeltsin and Russia's 
return to the communist past? This hope is quite preposterous. 
Russia would rather continue along the path of reforms. So, 
what will directors and chairmen of unprofitable Belarusian 
kolkhozes and sovkhozes or managers of bankrupt industrial 
enterprises do then? Let us imagine that they will be able to 
realize the dream of their life and include independent Belarus 
into a Russian protectorate or make it a Russian province. Do 
they believe that Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Shokhin, 
and Mr. Gerashchenko will hurry to issue them favorable credits? 
Will these unlucky managers enjoy the same maneuvering room 
they currently have? Will they be able to pay wages to their 
workers when Russian miners and militiamen have been living 
without wages for several months? 
  What fortified fraternity between the Belarusian and Russian 
peoples could they -- all those who wish to turn Belarusian 
workers into Russian parasites, such hanger-ons from the 
viewpoint of a Russian Philistine -- speak about? As for our 
Belarusian Philistine, he will blame all his mistakes and 
failures on "Moscow's intrigues." Wonderful prospects! No, we 
would do better to strive to develop mutually beneficial 
cooperation with Russia, and other states as well. There are 
objective conditions for that, we should only make proper use of 
them.

cancelled. True, he was present at a cabinet of ministers 
session devoted to the introduction of the national currency. 
According to eyewitness accounts, he did not look very well and 
was present for only 20 minutes. His visit to Turkey, scheduled 
for 23 June, has not been canceled, though. In the course of 
the visit a number of earlier signed agreements bearing on

  [Text] Uzbek President Islam Karimov left for Turkey today 
on an official state visit. Before his departure, answering a 
journalist's question, our country's leader said: 
  [Begin Karimov recording] After achieving our independence 
and sovereignty, small but noticeable changes are taking place 
in our policy and life and also in international and interstate 
ties and in politics. From this point of view we are 
establishing contacts with many countries including the small, 
the powerful, and the large, but we will be looking at how these 
countries see us, how close they are to us, how close their 
people are to us. 
  From this point of view Turkey is very close to us. [words 
indistinct] The people of Turkey, the Turkic peoples are very 
close to us. Their language and their heart but primarily their 
religion and their destiny are very close to us. [words 
indistinct] 
  Our relations with the Turkish leaders, public, and 
entrepreneurs are not bad and are currently developing well. 
For example, there are more than 100 joint enterprises and 
organizations [in Uzbekistan]. We must, however, be frank that 
there are forces who want to damage these ties, these close and 
friendly relations and it would be wrong to ignore these. For 
this reason such forces must be controlled and we must look at 
our relations with this close and strategically [word 
indistinct] state on the basis of a long sighted policy. 
  Raising economic and political ties with this state to a new 
level is the reason for our current visit. From this point of 
view I believe that Turkey looks at us with the same wish and 
hope and I think that this visit will raise our relations with 
Turkey to a new level -- primarily it will be in the interest of 
Uzbekistan and the people of Uzbekistan. [end recording]

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 21/6/1994 -- Today, President 
Mircea Snegur met with a Council of Europe experts group, headed 
by Ivan Koedzhikov [name as received], states a presidential 
press office communique. The experts group is visiting Moldova 
to examine the draft law on the special status for the districts 
densely inhabited by the ethnic Gagauz. The experts pointed out 
that "no one can deny that the Moldovan president and the 
parliamentary commissions want to settle this problem according 
to the human rights norms unanimously accepted." Koedzhikov 
mentioned that he had spoken with people from these districts 
and it is clear that they want to live in peace and 
understanding with the natives and other minorities. According 
to him, "there are no ethnic tensions in these regions." He 
pointed out this as an important factor in achieving a final 
agreement and adopting a law on this matter. President Snegur 
mentioned that the experts' recommendations are welcome and that 
they will give him additional credibility in the discussions 
with the Gagauz side. He also pointed out that "Moldova 
appreciates the efforts of the international organizations, and 
in particular the Council of Europe and the CSCE, in achieving 
political stability in Moldova." Snegur mentioned the necessity 
of finding compromises that are not ends in themselves, but 
rather a reality that should be taken into account. He said 
that "it is essential that the Gagauz people want to live in a 
united republic; this should be realized by the Comrat leaders, 
too," states the communique.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Viktor Grebenshchikov, the presidential state 
adviser, does not rule out that the contradictions on the draft 
decree on a special legal status of the Gagauzs agreed between 
the leaderships of Moldova and Gagauzia is "the result of a 
certain influence on the representatives of this region from the 
outside." 
  IF Note: Last Monday leadership of the self-proclaimed 
Gagauz 
republic accused Moldovan authorities of falsification of the 
draft decree on a special legal status of the regions densely 
populated with Gagauzs, which was agreed earlier, and declared 
that "despite the agreement Moldova's parliamentary commission 
has unilaterally introduced its changes into the document." 
Having called this move "a unilateral and unprecedented act," 
the Gagauz leadership asserted that it could not been made 
without the knowledge and consent of President Mircea Snegur and 
parliament chairman Pyotr Luchinsky. 
  In his exclusive interview with Interfax Grebenshchikov 
asserted that such actions have the aim to delay the process of 
the decree's adoption and finally the the aim to link solution 
of this issue with granting a special juridical status to 
Transdniestria. "These are quite different things and the Gagauz 
leaders understand this quite well, Grebenshchikov said. As for 
Gagauzia, the question concerns the fate of the ethnos which has 
the right for existence and development. Transdniestria's 
problem is a political one." 
  Grebenshchikov refused to give his estimate to the last 
statements of the Gagauz leaders "about serious contradictions 
on the draft decree." He qualified the attempts of the 
opposition to assert that Gagauzia is a republic as 
"demonstration of a certain extremism." As Grebenshchikov said, 
Article 1 of this draft concretely stipulates that Gagauzia is 
"a national-territorial autonomous entity as a form of 
self-determination of the Gagauzs and is a constituent part of 
the Republic of Moldova." "There are no contradictions between 
the parties regarding this Article," Grebenshchikov asserted. 
  He expressed his conviction saying that in the near term 
leaderships of Kishinev and Komrat "will come to a common 
denominator." (INTERFAX has learned that leaders of Moldova and 
Gagauzia are to meet next week). Grebenshchikov hopes that the 
Moldovan parliament would adopt the decree on Gagauzia's special 
legal status before its summer vacations.

  [Text] If UN troops come into the Dniester region they will 
not be perceived by the population as peacekeepers. This was 
said at a news conference today by Igor Smirnov, president of 
the Dniester-Moldavia [Moldova] Republic. Speaking about the 
results of the conference of international cooperation in 
peacekeeping in regions of conflict on the territory of the CIS, 
which was held in Moscow from 20-22 June, he expressed the firm 
conviction that only Russia has the right to peacekeeping 
activities in the Dniester region.

  [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 22/06/1994 -- Tomorrow, a 
delegation of the Moldovan Ministry of Transportation headed by 
Minister Vasili Iovv, will leave for Bucharest to meet with 
representatives of the Romanian Transportation Ministry. Vasile 
Iovv told BASA that "the visit's purpose is to establish 
cooperation relations in the field of transportation that will 
yield profits to both states." Nicolae Ciobanu, deputy head of 
the Roads Department, told BASA that negotiations on building a 
bridge across the Prut at Radauti-Lipcani will be also 
discussed. According to Ciobanu, a program on developing and 
integrating Moldovan highway networks into the European system 
will be elaborated. A program on repairing the bridges across 
the Prut at Galati-Giurgiulesti, Oancea-Cahul and 
Stanca-Costenti and the highways at these border points will be 
drafted. According to the Galati agreement, these highways will 
be passed to international regulations. Ciobanu pointed out 
that a joint administration of the navigation on the Prut river 
with an autonomous regulation of organization and functioning 
will be created. Vasile Iovv stated to BASA that the railway 
gauge will not be yet passed to the Romanian standards as 
Moldova does not have sufficient funding for such works. The 
last meeting between Moldovan and Romanian Transportation 
Ministries occurred in November 1993.

  [Text] Tighina (Bender), BASAPRSS, 22/6/1994 -- The Joint 
Control Commission held today in Tighina (Bender) a meeting. At 
the Moldovan delegation's proposal, the sides kept a moment of 
silence in the memory of those died in the World War II at the 
beginning of the meeting. Then the joint military command 
presented a report on the situation in the security zone during 
last week. The group for investigating the chases of those 
disappeared without trace during the 1992 armed conflict also 
presented a report. The session discoursed the project on 
cooperation between the Joint Control Commission and CSCE in the 
security zone proposed by the CSCE mission to Moldova. The 
report of the Joint Military Command indicated that a grenade 
and 16 cartridges were confiscated from a Tighina inhabitant 
last week. Some 107 people were detained for violating the 
regulations of the security zone. The report also states that 
the Dniester side again impeded the Joint Control Commission 
from inspecting the Tighina fortress where as it was earlier 
reported a Dniester motorized battalion is located. The report 
also mentioned that Dniestr guardians detained a car belonging 
to the Moldovan peace-keeping forces. The Dniester guardians 
were located in the security zone contrary to the 1992 agreement 
between the Moldovan and Russian Presidents. It was suggested 
that the parties examine the CSCE mission's proposal and discuss 
it at a new joint session with the CSCE mission representatives.

  [Text] President Mircea Snegur has called for parliamentary 
approval of the government-proposed economic recovery plan for 
1994-97. 
  He said that as a first stage, it was important to curb 
inflation so as to strengthen the entire infrastructure of the 
market economy. 
  "If we fail to do this quickly, there will be a new round of 
inflation leading to most dire implications," Snegur said. 
  The president spoke against emergency economic measures 
calling instead for calm and regaining public trust. 
  At the same time, he admitted that initial conditions for 
implementing the government program were bad: there was a 
further slump in production, widespread stoppages and very low 
investment activity. 
  Snegur named budgetary, financial and crediting policies, 
industrial reorganization, privatization, utilization of the 
workforce and social security safeguards as key problems facing 
the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Nikonov, deputy of the Russian </F>
Federation State Duma, under the "Carte Blanche" rubric: "A 
Hereditary Party. Why Are We Increasingly Hearing About 
Delaying Presidential and Parliamentary Elections?"] 
  [Text] Efforts are afoot to gradually condition us to the 
fact that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will 
not take place at the time established by the Constitution. 
Rumors, inspired "leaks" followed by direct statements on this 
count, and many other things point to a decreasing possibility 
of the voters electing a new Duma at the end of 1995 and voting 
for a new, or old, president in June 1996. 
  Hints are coming from circles close to the head of state's 
entourage about the possibility of prolonging the Federal 
Assembly's brief, two-year, existence for another couple of 
years in exchange for an analogous extension of the incumbent 
president's powers. In the Duma such a deal, relieving the 
deputies of the headache caused by the need to face fresh 
elections, finds increasing understanding. An appeal recently 
circulated by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] 
faction contains the following number one point: "Given the 
absence of normal conditions for lawmaking activity by the Duma 
and the deputies in working with their constituents, the term of 
its present composition should be extended by two years." 
  Thank God, so far the LDPR does not set the procedures for 
forming state power bodies, but it is clear that a drive toward 
destroying the corresponding constitutional provisions has begun. 
  Even now it is clear which arguments are being made and will 
yet be made in support of this idea. Many words will be spoken 
about the vital need for stability and continuity of power, 
which were secured at such pains in the Social Accord Pact. 
About the impermissibility of jeopardizing democratic 
transformations embodied by President Boris Yeltsin. About the 
need for more time for the main power branches to adapt and 
begin real work to adopt the legislative enactments that are so 
important to Russia. And finally, historical arguments will be 
cited to confirm that the prolonged existence of state 
leadership in unchanged form fully corresponds to the domestic 
political tradition. 
  I cannot say that the above-mentioned arguments have no 
political or logical rationale. Nonetheless I am sure: To 
follow this path is not in the country's interests. And not 
because the intention is primarily to keep in power those who 
already have it. 
  Continuity and efficiency of state institutions and the need 
for their adaptation should have been considered earlier, when 
the current Constitution was being written and adopted. Now, 
for all its imperfections, it -- and not individual 
personalities -- is the guarantor of social and political 
stability. What undermines the state's buttresses and hinders 
consolidation of the democratic tradition is violations of the 
Constitution, increasingly committed by top officials. 
  I shall venture to state my confidence that Russia will 
emerge as a democratic and civilized state only when a 
constitutional change of supreme ruling authority takes place in 
the country for the first time in its more than millennium-old 
history. 
  I stress: constitutional, not merely apparently legitimate, 
as has been the case in the previous decades and centuries. 
  Before 1917, there was no constitution to speak of, and 
therefore there could be no question of the handover of power. 
Continuity was ensured through heredity, and this was called 
monarchy. After the Revolution there were many fundamental laws 
but none of them stipulated a mechanism for such a handover, 
while the supreme ruling authority itself was for the most part 
unconstitutional. The removal of Mikhail Gorbachev from the 
helm also, as is known, had nothing to do with the Constitution 
-- the Union or the Russian one -- and brought about the 
destruction of the USSR. 
  The democratically elected legislative bodies have also been 
unlucky. Out of four pre-Revolutionary Dumas, three were 
disbanded. Neither the Congress of People's Deputies and the 
Supreme Soviet of the USSR, nor the Congress and Supreme Soviet 
of the Russian Federation of the previous convocation died a 
natural, that is to say constitutional, death. And the birth of 
the present Federal Assembly was never based on the Law. 
  One conclusion follows from all this: Presidential and 
Federal Assembly elections should take place when they are 
supposed to. Only in this event shall we be citizens of a 
democratic country, not an eastern despotic regime with some 
democratic embellishments. If there are no elections, it will 
be a short way to hereditary presidency and deputyship. 
  Some may dislike this. But not myself or my colleagues in 
the Duma PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov has said the idea 
of extending the tenure of office of both parliament and 
president, proposed by the speaker of the upper house - the 
Council of the Federation - Vladimir Shumeyko is not new. 
  Satarov told IF [Interfax] Wednesday morning that back a 
month ago, when President Yeltsin met with the group of State 
Duma members called the "December 12 Liberal-Democratic Union", 
State Duma member Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his 
attitude to the idea of extending parliament. Satarov said the 
President replied he was not against that "on the condition the 
State Duma and the Council of the Federation proved effective". 
  That idea has been discussed as a possibility in 
professional 
circles for a long time", Satarov said. 
  The presidential aide said that when I. Khakamada asked the 
President about the idea of prolonging his own term of office, 
Yeltsin replied: "Don't touch the 1996 elections, please". 
Satarov said he would not comment on the President's statement. 
  The presidential aide believes that if the idea of extending 
powers gains the upper hand, amendments to the current 
Constitution will most probably be made through a referendum. 
"However, the subject of holding the referendum will remain open 
until both houses of parliament have approved of a law on the 
referendum", Satarov said. 
  In an exclusive interview granted to Interfax on Tuesday 
Shumeyko said it would be expedient to postpone both 
presidential and parliamentary elections for two years. The 
speaker of the upper house said he had discussed that with the 
President, who, Shumeyko said "does not object in principle to 
prolonging his tenure of office". "He (Yeltsin) sees this as a 
normal way out, because what the country needs today is a period 
of stability", Shumeyko said. 
  According to Shumeyko the speaker of the lower house, the 
State Duma Ivan Rybkin is for that proposal, too. 
  "Members of parliament are politicians", the speaker said. 
"Once a person becomes a politician, he must decide whether to 
go on with his or her political career. If politicians know 
their term is about to expire, they will keep the forthcoming 
elections in mind whenever they walk to the speaking stand. We 
should be concerned about different things now, about the state. 
We have put Russia on the track of reform and the first stage 
of reform ended on December 12 1993. Now we must take care of 
fostering the state". 
  Shumeyko recalled that the Constitution had established a 
four-year term for both houses of the Federal Assembly, whereas 
the first Council of the Federation and State Duma were elected 
for a transitional period of two years. "Why should there be a 
transitional period of two years, and not four?" Shumeyko asked. 
He believes it would be enough to amend the second section of 
the constitution ("Final and Transitional Provisions") to double 
the term of the first parliament. 
  Shumeyko said the first two chapters of the Constitution 
could be altered in no way other than calling a referendum, 
whereas the others could be amended by parliament. "The 
Constitution does not specify how the second section can be 
changed", the speaker of the upper house said. "Since nothing 
definite is stated, the legal practice requires the general 
procedure, that is a referendum. The referendum would be far 
less costly than new elections". 
  Shumeyko said that if the first Federal Assembly were 
extended alongside the presidential term (1996 elections would 
then be canceled), the period of stability in Russia may last 
2-3 years. 
  The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament 
told 
IF on Wednesday one should be very cautious about the idea of 
extending the powers of parliament. "We've got to show the 
people we are worthy of the extension", Rybkin said. 
  The State Duma Speaker said neither house of the Federal 
Assembly was as efficient as necessary yet. He said that the 
country still had no budget and "some politickers seek to 
capitalize on that". Rybkin said he was referring to those who 
had earlier worked in the government and then took senior posts 
in both houses of parliament. 
  Rybkin even ventured the guess it would be reasonable to 
re-elect parliament as early as next year. "The people, aware of 
their bitter experiences, would elect totally new people", he 
said. 
  Interviewed by IF earlier, Rybkin said the idea of extending 
parliament and the president would be realistic under three 
conditions: "if the economy develops signs of stabilization 
within the next two or three months; if an appropriate legal 
network is formed, and if both houses of the Federal Assembly 
prove efficient". "These pre-requisites seem to be in the making 
and the march of events looks constructive", Rybkin said. He 
added he would be happy about the extension of both parliament 
and the president provided all the mentioned conditions were met.

  [Text] Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
Sergei Stepashin voiced his support for the presidential decree 
on urgent measures to combat organized crime. 
  Addressing the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office 
on Thursday, he said that without going into legal assessments 
of the methods of implementing the presidential decree, he fully 
supported the political decision to pass it. 
  He said that the problem lay in the fact that foreign 
special 
services are trying to penetrate into Russian criminal 
structures, establish control over them and use them to the 
detriment of Russian interests. He also pointed out that making 
use of the undefined status of Russian state borders, the 
national security services of the Baltic states and other 
republics "have established contacts with Russian criminals for 
intelligence purposes. 
  He said that a joint directive would be sent to the Russian 
power ministries' territorial bodies in which the disputed 
provisions of the decree will be brought into line with current 
laws. 
  He announced that the Russian president was considering a 
draft decree on the restoration of the investigation department 
in the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. According to his 
sources, the decree will be signed soon.

  [Text] Acting Prosecutor-General Aleksey Ilyushenko 
supports the presidential decree on urgent measures to protect 
the population from banditry and organized crime. 
  Now that armed and organized criminals are brazenly trying 
to 
establish their rules in the country and unleash terror, curbing 
organized crime is becoming a task of the greatest importance, 
he told the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office on 
Thursday. 
  "In fact, we are faced with the question of who will bring 
down whom to their knees: the state the mafia, or the mafia the 
state," he said. He demanded that the task of combating crime 
and coordinating the work of the law- enforcement bodies be 
given priority attention. 
  He said the emergency measures, set forth in the decree, did 
not at all imply the neglect of the constitution or the law. On 
the basis of the available opportunities the state must curb the 
criminals and apply the new laws to them in all their 
strictness, he said. 
  "We are well aware of the real possibilities of criminal 
reprisals and do not consider them a panacea in our struggle 
against crime. However, in the current setting, the punitive 
power of the law must be used fully and without hesitation," 
said Ilyushenko. 
  He said he could understand society's concern about possible 
malpractices during the implementation of the decree and 
admitted that the law-enforcement bodies had violated the laws 
in many instances lately, acting in an arbitrary way. 
  He said that the measures proposed in the decree were aimed 
at attaining a real breakthrough in the struggle against crime, 
not at violating human rights, and that the main gaol of the 
decree was to protect the citizens from organized terror. 
  He proposed ensuring strict control over the observance of 
laws during the implementation of the presidential decree. 
  According to his sources, compared to 1989 the crime rate 
has 
more than doubled in Russia. A total of 2.8 million crimes, 
including 500,000 serious ones, were committed in 1993. Among 
them were 30,000 premeditated murders, 67,000 serious injuries 
and more than 220,000 robberies. Over the first five months of 
1994, 1.94 million crimes were committed, including 216,000 
serious crimes, said Ilyushenko.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Correspondent T. Aldoshina] Acting 
procurator-general Aleksandr Ilyushenko said today that by using 
criminal terrorist methods, the criminal formations operating on 
Russian territory have essentially taken over the streets, 
towns, and populated localities. 
  [Ilyushenko] Their barefaced insolence and impunity are 
creating an atmosphere of fear and helplessness in society. 
  [Aldoshina] Over the first five months of this year, 
1,094,000 crimes were registered, 216,000 of them serious 
crimes. In the view of participants in the extended sitting of 
the procuracy's collegium, the federal program for combatting 
crime and the president's edict on protecting the population 
from gang violence should put an end to organized crime. 
However, the document is controversial. 
  [I. Kostoyev, chairman of the Federation Council's Committee 
for Constitutional Legislation] It is quite clear that the 
president's edict contradicts the constitution and a number of 
federal laws. 
  [Aldoshina] Issa Kostoyev believes, however, that the actual 
state of affairs must be borne in mind and, given the outburst 
of gang violence, that the edict should be used as an interim 
legal enactment. Those assembled in the hall believe that it is 
now a question of who will bring whom down first, the state or 
the mafia? And the law enforcement bodies intend to demonstrate 
their strength whatever happens. 
  [Sergey Stepashin, director of the Russian Federal 
Counterintelligence Service] I am in favor of the violation of 
human rights, if the person involved is a bandit and criminal. 
There can be no alternative here. 
  [Aldoshina] The only person who objected to this stance was 
Sergey Kovalev. 
  [Sergey Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation 
President's Human Rights Commission] Human rights exist. If you 
are in favor of violation of the rights of the criminal, you are 
in favor of the violation of human rights. This axiom is known 
worldwide. 
  [Aldoshina] As the acting procurator-general explained 
today, 
only the Constitutional Court can revoke the president's edict. 
However, the participants in the procuracy collegium are fully 
determined to use this document to bring the full punitive force 
of the law to bear and achieve a real breakthrough in the crime 
situation.

  [Text] The decree on fighting organized crime, signed by 
President Yeltsin last week, is in the center of the media's 
attention and provokes tough discussions between the supporters 
and opponents of the tough measures stated by Yeltsin. Today 
Mikhail Yegorov, deputy interior minister and head of the 
department for fighting organized crime, met journalists. 
Andrey Zenkov reports: 
  [Zenkov] The existence of organized crime in Russia was 
recognized officially by the top militia authorities relatively 
recently. Having recognized it, they started to actively show 
journalists documentaries of chases and exchanges of fire that 
ended happily bandits being detained, just as in American 
gangster movies. The fact that over half of these bandits are 
released after 48 hours and godfathers do not even figure in 
cases is not the fault of militia, but of out-of-date 
legislation. 
  [Begin Yegorov recording] We keep on repeating again and 
again: Give us the opportunity to make examinations prior to 
instituting proceedings and to carry out checks of documents. 
Let us work with those detained. We need to stop releasing the 
leaders of organized criminal groups and their members on bail, 
since they have lots of money. Incidentally, we need to gather 
evidence. It is difficult to gather evidence in two days. The 
posession of weapons, be it a nuclear bomb or a pistol -- our 
law is far from being perfect in this respect -- attracts 
roughly the same punishment. Nineteen and a half percent of 
those detained under Articles 218-219 are sentenced to 
imprisonment. The rest leave to re-commit crimes. [end recording] 
  Mikhail Yegorov, one of the authors of Yeltsin's famous 
draft decree on fighting crime, stressed again that measures 
that are tough from the point of view of human rights, including 
the audit of accounts of the relatives of those under scrutiny, 
will be used only when fighting organized crime, which is 
responsible for up to 1,500 crimes committed in Russia daily.

  [Text] Isa Kostoyev, Chairman of the Federation Council 
Committee on constitutional legislature and legal issues, 
declared to Interfax Friday that there is official statistical 
data in the Interior Ministry and Federal Counterintelligence 
Service stating that many Russian state enterprises are under 
the control of mafia structures. 
  "There are thousands of criminal trials carried out due to 
this fact. For example, the products of industrial enterprises 
in many regions is quite competitive with imported goods brought 
by commercial structures and criminal elements urge that these 
enterprises export their production outside the region. A 
director is forced to obey because he does not want to subject 
his own life and his family to danger." 
  "Not to speak about those commercial enterprises which 
cannot 
make a single move without the knowledge of the mafia," Kostoyev 
added. "I know that in the Western world the mafia also exerts 
certain pressure, but it does not touch upon state enterprises. 
We have already left the West far behind in this sphere, he 
pointed out. Given the current situation it is necessary to use 
emergency measures to combat organized crime but it should be 
done in the frameworks of precise laws so that innocent people 
do not suffer," Kostoyev said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Sergey Kovalev Considers President's </F>
Edict Dangerous"] 
  [Text] S. Kovalev, chairman of the Russian Federation 
president's Human Rights Commission, has sent a letter to B. 
Yeltsin regarding his edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the 
Population From Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organized 
Crime." 
  It is obvious to us, S. Kovalev writes, that it is necessary 
to step up the fight against crime, the growth in which is 
naturally of concern to all sectors of Russian society. The 
work of law-enforcement organs, which are meant to conduct this 
fight within the framework of existing legislation, needs 
radical improvement. Needless to say, the possibility of 
improving their work is not ruled out. 
  The tragic experience of Russia, S. Kovalev stressed, shows 
that citizens' safety cannot be protected by violating the basic 
rights and freedoms enshrined in Chapter 2 of the Russian 
Constitution. It is no accident that Articles 64 and 135 of the 
Constitution envisage a special procedure for making changes to 
this chapter. 
  The conflicts with the norms of existing criminal procedural 
legislation and the legally vague formulas used in the edict 
create a possibility of its being interpreted as broadly as 
people like, S. Kovalev believes, and he voices the fear that 
implementation of the edict would be accompanied by arbitrary 
actions by law-enforcement departments -- unjustified arrests, 
interference in citizens' private and economic activities, and a 
growth in corruption among officials. This, in particular, is 
confirmed by reports from the Republic of Bashkortostan and 
Tatarstan, where similar acts of legislation are already in 
force. 
  Under the Constitution, the letter goes on to say, you, as 
Russian president, are the guarantor of the rights and freedoms 
of the individual and the citizen. We are confident that you do 
not share the concept espoused by certain leaders of power 
structures who think that the rights of some citizens can be 
protected by violating the rights of others. This approach 
shows that we have still not learned the lessons of our own past. 
  The edict you have signed is also dangerous because, by 
pursuing short-term political advantage, it essentially 
undermines respect for the law and faith in the stability of the 
recently adopted Constitution. 
  The letter concludes with a request from the Human Rights 
Commission for B. Yeltsin to suspend Edict No. 1226 of 14 June 
1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Smirnov, director of the Moscow </F>
research center for human rights, by correspondent Dmitriy 
Orlov; date and place of interview not stated: "Demand that 
Official `Play by the Rules'"] 
  [Text] The Moscow research center for human rights is an 
association of independent human rights organizations (the 
Moscow group for promoting the fulfillment of the Helsinki 
agreements, the "movement without frontiers" group, the public 
center for promoting the reform of criminal law, the committee 
of soldiers' mothers, the independent psychiatric association, 
the society for the protection of convicted economic leaders and 
for economic freedoms, and others). The center's public council 
includes Ye. Bonner, B. Zolotukhin, S. Kovalev, and A. 
Pristavkin. The problems which exist today in the field of the 
protection of human rights are described by Aleksey Smirnov, the 
center's director, in a talk with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
correspondent Dmitriy Orlov. 
  [Orlov] Aleksey Olegovich, what in your view is above all 
preventing the assertion in Russia of international norms for 
the protection of human rights? 
  [Smirnov] Primarily the fact that in the law enforcement 
organs and structures of power there are still people working 
who have not borne any responsibility for law violations and 
crimes committed in the past. "That is what it was like then" 
is a typical empty refrain of the workers of the former KGB. A 
mass of evidence of crimes by the authorities has been 
accumulated. I believe that a decision should be made to repeal 
the statute of limitations with regard to the communist regime's 
crimes against the individual. Can we speak of law today if 
past crimes are unpunished? 
  [Orlov] Does that mean you are in favor of opening and 
inspecting correspondence? 
  [Smirnov] Yes, if this is understood not as sweeping 
dismissals of state employees but as a careful study of each 
specific case, exclusively, of course, within the framework of 
existing legal procedure. 
  Proving crimes committed in the past and even initiating 
criminal proceedings is hard work. 
  Today there is not a single precedent for punishing KGB 
staffers. Yet the KGB tortured Sakharov before my very eyes! 
Many people died in the camps. Where are the culprits? Still 
in power? Still deciding our lives? I shall cite a personal 
example. The investigator who was in charge of my case during 
the years of stagnation has falsified the interrogation records. 
I can prove this because I kept parallel records and recorded 
violations of the law. What were violated were not the USSR's 
international commitments but the criminal procedure norms in 
operation at the time -- at the time! How did the Moscow 
prosecutor's office reply to me? There are few investigators 
and many difficulties and the worker in charge of your case 
resigned, and it was a long time ago.... 
  [Orlov] Can you note instances of the most flagrant 
violations of human rights in Russia relatively recently? 
  [Smirnov] Of course. The most graphic of them is the regime 
introduced by the Moscow City Hall for registering incomers. I 
like Mayor Luzhkov as a person: He is a practical person who 
does not stop to think and makes decisions swiftly. But the 
decision on administrative banishment.... It is clear how it 
could be carried out (and is now being carried out): According 
to the principle that you can't make an omelet without breaking 
eggs. In my view when applying preventive measures of this kind 
in the struggle against crime, powerful mechanisms must be 
created for monitoring the militia's actions. And unless the 
Moscow City Hall does this, our center will receive complaints 
of violations of human rights in this field and render legal aid 
to victims, including by dispatching materials to the 
prosecutor's office and court. I nonetheless hope that in the 
very near future Mayor Luzhkov will create organs for monitoring 
the actions of the Moscow law enforcement organs within the 
framework of the registration regime. 
  [Orlov] How effective is your center's activity? Can you 
help many people? 
  [Smirnov] In one day the organizations belonging to the 
center receive up to 100 people. In simplified terms 50 of them 
are simply people who do not properly understand what is 
happening, 25 percent are not in the right place (as a rule they 
are interested in socioeconomic problems), and only with regard 
to the remaining quarter do we take any actions. We manage to 
help nearly half of these. 
  In general we are obliged to work constantly in practical 
human rights activity. There is virtually no time left for 
lobbying in the organs of executive power, educational projects, 
or legislative initiatives on human rights issues. Yet 
essentially the system of "giving charity to every poor person" 
is not effective -- we must create conditions such that he does 
not have to ask for it. 
  [Orlov] A specific question. Recently the organs of state 
power and the mass media and in particular our publication have 
been receiving requests to expand the system of benefits for 
those repressed under the bolshevik regime. What is your 
attitude toward such appeals? 
  [Smirnov] We often get them too. It seems to me that 
increasing monetary grants and giving food and so forth on the 
basis of lists is not very fair to other citizens of the 
country, to taxpayers! No monetary compensations! We must not 
"give" or "take." For former political prisoners it would be 
far more useful to be relieved of taxes and municipal charges. 
  [Orlov] What general recommendations could you give to those 
citizens who do not want to become victims of the violation of 
their rights? 
  [Smirnov] The main thing is to know the law and the 
procedures for protecting your own rights. You must appeal to 
legal advice bureaus. You must learn to work with the 
authorities, not to set yourself against a particular zealous 
official but to demand toughly that he "play by the rules." 
  Systematic violations of human rights today come not "from 
above," as in 1970-1980, but "from below," from the local 
authorities. We can and must fight that.

  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- "There have not been 
any profound reforms in Russia. What has happened here is 
perestroyka of the purest kind," the leader of the "Yabloko" 
group in the State Duma, the well-known economist Grigoriy 
Yavlinskiy, claims. For most people in the country "things are 
exactly the same as they were before," he writes in an article 
published in the latest issue of the weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. 
"The most important elements of the old Soviet way of organizing 
socio-economic affairs still exist and operate here. The 
monopolies and the former structures of production remain 
unchanged. There is no real private ownership or competition. 
Land reform is not being carried out. Democratic procedures 
for public accountability have not been worked out. A system of 
local self-government has not been established. There is no 
real separation of powers." 
  People are now talking about stabilization, but 
stabilization 
of "such a system is not a blessing," the deputy warns. "This 
signifies that Russia continues to be an oligarchical and 
super-monopolized state. All that's changed is the `political 
superstructure'," Yavlinskiy says. "The CPSU has gone, but it 
has been replaced by strong criminal influence on government." 
  "It is impossible to run such a system by normal democratic 
methods," Yavlinskiy warns. "In the Soviet era Politburo 
decisions were the most effective instrument of government. 
Taken by a small group of people, without public discussion, 
without adherence to democratic `conditionality', their 
implementation was mandatory. Unfortunately, the latest edicts 
issued by the president are very reminiscent of those 
decisions." "The main danger is that undemocratic, unlawful and 
even unconstitutional methods of administration are being openly 
resorted to," he believes. 
  He says that "the culmination of this deviation from 
previously proclaimed principles was the edict on `Urgent 
Measures To Protect the Public Against Gangsterism and Other 
Manifestations of Organized Crime'. This edict violates 
virtually everything that can be violated: human rights, a 
number of federal laws, the constitution itself. The whole 
country can see that not only the `spirit of the law' but its 
actual `letter' is being contravened. Furthermore it is being 
contravened by the sole guarantor of the constitution - the 
president."

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The leadership of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) examines the issue of 
withdrawing from the Public Accord Treaty, LDPR leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy told a news conference at the Russian parliament 
lower house on Friday. 
  According to Zhirinovskiy, the LDPR is forced to do this "by 
the present course of the Russian leadership" which "does not 
justify the hopes" of Liberal Democrats for resolving problems 
facing the country. 
  Speaking about policy towards former Soviet republics and 
other foreign countries, Zhirinovskiy called for closing down 
some sections of the state border and for expelling from Russia 
those who have no entry visas. He demanded that Russian troops 
be pulled out of all "flash points". 
  "No contacts with NATO and no joint war games," thundered 
the 
LDPR leader. 
  Turning to domestic problems, he favoured an immediate 
suspension of "privatisation a la Chubays". Zhirinovskiy said 
that the LDPR parliamentary group did not vote on Friday for the 
1994 federal budget which, in the group's opinion, is "an 
anti-social budget". 
  Zhirinovskiy disfavoured proposals on extending powers of 
the 
president and parliament. "We cannot adopt this version," the 
LDPR leader said at the lower house, giving, however, no 
explanations why his group favours this position.

  [Text] Moscow, June 24 (AFP) -- Russia's secret service is 
planning to assassinate ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, an aide claimed Friday. 
  Sergei Abelsev, a member of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal 
Democratic 
Party, told reporters that according to information he had 
gathered "the secret service is preparing an attack against 
Zhirinovskiy." 
  Speaking at the same news conference, Zhirinovskiy denounced 
the "campaign of lies and humiliation" against him. 
  He said the campaign has pushed his party to reassess its 
decision to join Russian President Boris Yeltsin's Agreement on 
Obtaining Civil Accord in Russia. 
  The pact, signed in April by some 200 leading Russian 
politicians, aimed to establish temporary groundrules to limit 
confrontation in domestic politics and stabilize the country. 
  Signatories to the accord undertook not to call for early 
elections, not to amend the new constitution for the time being 
and to refrain from violating the constitution in their 
political activities. 
  Zhirinovskiy's party signed the accord after several weeks 
of 
hesitating.

  [Text] Moscow, June 23 (TASS) -- Russia is responsible for 
the CIS countries' development. For a long time Russia was a 
force that united the former republics of the USSR, and it has 
no moral right to disregard their problems now. 
  This was the leitmotiff of the hearings on international 
cooperation in support of peace in conflict zones on CIS 
territory organized by a number of State Duma committees, 
including on CIS affairs, on relations with compatriots abroad, 
on defence and international affairs. 
  Representatives of CIS member-countries and Western 
diplomats 
in Moscow showed keen interest in the conference because of the 
urgency of its themes. 
  Russian scientists, historians and diplomats who took part 
in 
the hearings noted that Russia was the only force capable of 
resolving armed conflicts in CIS countries. They said 
international organisations, such as the United Nations and the 
Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, were not very 
helpful. Therefore Russia has to move quickly and resolutely to 
put an end to armed conflicts and arrange for peaceful 
negotiations between the warring parties.

Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee, by 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA Chief Editor Valentin Chikin; place and date 
not given: "Our Cause Is Right"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Chikin] Left-wing 
politicians and patriotic movements are now groundlessly 
accusing ordinary people: The people could not care less, they 
claim, the people are silently observing events. Even those who 
came under fire at the House of Soviets last October are also 
complaining about the people -- they did not rise, they did not 
defend. Yet you are saying that they have awaked, and shifted 
to the left.... Have you felt this during your tours, has this 
awakening reached a sufficient depth? 
  [Zyuganov] Valentin Vasilyevich, I have the benefit of quite 
extensive personal observations. Following the party congress, 
I made 25 tours covering 45 of the largest centers. Essentially 
they covered the entire social spectrum. Furthermore, the 
contacts took the most diverse forms, right up to and including 
open-door meetings which could have been attended by any voter 
walking in from the street. Only very recently we counted more 
than 30,000 persons in the halls where I had occasion to speak. 
I can confirm the following: People wish to know what is 
actually happening, how they are being duped, which forces are 
in opposition. Let me be frank: There was a watershed on 3-4 
October. Meetings are different nowadays. The stupor has worn 
off. Everyone realizes that they are being deprived of 
everything -- jobs, social guarantees, leave entitlement, 
medical treatment, even the possibility to move away from 
Vorkuta.... I first encountered this in Vorkuta -- elderly 
passersby stopping in the streets and crying their eyes out 
about the state to which they have been reduced. You have 
someone who has spent 25 years working in the polar regions, and 
everything he has ever earned has been reduced to nothing, he 
has no opportunity to move away or send away his children or 
elderly parents.... [passage omitted] 
  At the same time, there is no longer any room to maneuver. 
Misfortune is already affecting not just the elderly but also 
the children. Mentally, whenever a Russian sees that misfortune 
is affecting children, he behaves more energetically and becomes 
stauncher. The opposition is now living through an 
exceptionally important period, a time when it has to analyze 
developments, regroup, and accurately define the main lines of 
action. A weighty word can be spoken here by the "Accord for 
Russia" movement. Real cooperation must be achieved between all 
patriotic forces on a broad platform of preserving the country's 
integrity, peace in it, and prosperity in each home. There must 
a structural preparation of the movement in all Russian regions. 
Therefore, special importance attaches to regular visits to the 
provinces, meetings with the aktiv, consolidation of ties with 
it, and support for it. Especially since, in 70 out of the 88 
regions, representative organs have been joined by people who 
are perfectly well aware of the meaning and spirit of the 
patriotic movement, reflecting the interests of broad strata of 
voters, and capable of collective actions for the sake of their 
people and their fatherland. 
  It is perfectly obvious that now there are two trends 
developing somewhat in parallel; the question is which one will 
take the lead -- the destroyers and annihilators of Russia or 
the people's patriotic forces which are already perfectly well 
aware of what is happening. 
  [Chikin] In this context, we have the question of State 
Duma deputies' responsibility to the people for the country's 
future. Last December all parties contested a single federal 
district -- so, whose is it now, how confident do Communists and 
their allies feel in the Duma? 
  [Zyuganov] On the whole I am satisfied with the position, 
composition, and abilities of my colleagues from the deputies' 
faction. The faction now has a highly representative 
professional and national composition, the voters' instructions 
have been used to compile a sound package of draft laws, and 
many of them are already in the works. Even our opponents have 
been forced to admit that the Communist Party faction has a 
strong collective potential and is capable of working with all 
sectors of the Duma, attracting many allies whenever necessary. 
We are grateful to the Agrarians with whom we share complete 
mutual understanding, we act jointly with the women's faction 
and the Democratic Party of Russia on a whole series of issues, 
and regional deputies quite attentively heed our position. 
Whenever a question of principle has been at stake, we have 
garnered 230-260 votes. 
  On the other hand, all-out attempts are being made to depict 
the Duma's activity as being limited only to the radical 
position of "Russia's Choice" and some of its allies. Any 
proposal for stabilization is either boycotted or rejected by 
them. Everything to do with stabilizing the economy, halting 
the disintegration, safeguarding security, or struggling against 
crime -- everything is boycotted.... Even the Law on Struggle 
Against Corruption, which demands the establishment of 
elementary norms adopted in practice by the West a long time ago 
-- like declaration of income and the impossibility of combining 
state service with trade or commercial activity -- even this is 
being boycotted by these people because they have chosen the 
position of hindering the Duma's work as much as possible. We 
can see that a mighty and concerted march has been launched 
against the representative power as such. This takes the form 
of loathsome articles and insinuations about individual 
factions, of attempts to denigrate opponents. Nonetheless, the 
healthy nucleus in the Duma is getting stronger. 
  As regards our own faction, each month the deputies spend 
one 
week in their electoral districts and report back to their 
voters. Let me say that the last round of visits showed that our 
deputies had visited at least five to seven labor collectives 
and received a powerful charge of fresh ideas and interesting 
proposals. 
  We initiated the introduction of proposals to urgently 
examine the question of the emergency in the country's 
socioeconomic situation jointly with Federation Council 
deputies, and invitations were issued to the government and the 
president's representatives. Work is now under way to prepare 
this meeting, and I assume that it could prove exceptionally 
fruitful and could lead to serious and impartial assessments of 
the president's course in today's conditions. I can foresee a 
very powerful opposition to this sitting. 
  On the other hand, we have planned a meeting between the 
faction and voters from the capital at the Parliamentary Center 
so that we could report back to them, and then to travel across 
the Russian Federation's regions, submit joint reports with the 
party aktiv on the results of our work over the last six months, 
and define our strategy and tactics for the immediate future. 
  [Chikin] It goes without saying that, for the chairman of 
the Central Executive Committee, all these routes also lead 
right across the party structures. How is the party's 
organizational development progressing now? What features are 
more noticeable in its image: those of Zhukov and Korolev, 
those of Brezhnev and Gorbachev, or some others?... 
  [Zyuganov] The past 15 months have brought radical changes 
to the party's life. Here are just the statistics of major 
events. We held one congress, two party conferences, six 
plenums, eight zonal conferences (and a whole series of new ones 
is about to begin), and five major scientific-practical 
conferences on key questions concerning the economy, stable 
development, the party's organizational development, activity 
with workers collectives and trade unions, and so on. The 
party's entire vertical structure was restored during this 
period. We now have party organizations in all major 
settlements, cities, republics, krays, and oblasts. The 
following result was summed up at the party conference: Now we 
have 550,000 party members concentrated in more than 20,000 
party organizations. The leadership structure was rejuvenated 
during the last report and election campaign by 10 years on 
average, and ties have been restored with more than 100 
left-wing parties and movements all over the world. 
  We held several meetings with our colleagues from communist 
parties revived on the territory of the former USSR which, 
incidentally, already count more than 1 million Communists in 
their ranks. Meetings were held in Orel, Minsk, and the Moscow 
region. Leaders of 19 parties gathered recently at Lenin Hills 
and adopted what I believe to be some very important documents: 
On the concept of restoring a renewed union state, which was 
adopted unanimously; on the 50th anniversary of victory in the 
Great Patriotic War and on Zhukov's 100th birth anniversary; on 
Lenin's 125th birth anniversary; on protection of our associates 
languishing behind bars, primarily in the Baltic countries.... 
On the whole, we succeeded in reviving a union of sufficiently 
combat-capable organizations. 
  At the same time, a renewal of the philosophy of ideology is 
also under way. Unless our ideology is backed by the ideas of 
great power status, statehood, and patriotism -- in addition to 
the ideas of social justice, brotherhood of people, and 
friendship among peoples -- the party will hardly be able to 
perform its historic mission, because the main crisis today is 
the crisis of patriotic awareness. It is, after all, no secret 
that the country and the CPSU produced an unbelievably large 
number of traitors and turncoats. People like Zhukov and 
Korolev were brought up on the spirit of the feats by Aleksandr 
Nevskiy, Dmitriy Donskoy, Suvorov, and Kutuzov -- those who gave 
unsparingly of themselves for the fatherland's sake. 
  [Chikin] But these new ideological acquisitions can also be 
interpreted as a repudiation of the classical dogmas of Marxism 
-- proletarian internationalism, class struggle, revolutionary 
aims.... 
  [Zyuganov] People are trying to oversimplify the situation 
and reduce it to primitivism.... On the subject of proletarian 
internationalism. Look at the situation: Virtually the entire 
machine building industry is at a standstill. ZIL and 
Rosselmash, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant and Kirovskiy Zavod 
are up in arms.... What was the response by workers in Kharkov 
and Minsk, by the proletariat of the Ruhr and Detroit? Did they 
go out in the streets in protest against growing unemployment in 
Chelyabinsk and Rostov? Did they halt the trainloads of 
Snickers being shipped to our country?... Did they, indeed! 
The current regime is skillfully dividing professionals and 
workers even within the same specialized field.... A driver in 
one place earns 70,000 rubles, another driver somewhere else 
earns 700,000 -- a 10-fold discrepancy, which is absolutely 
impermissible in principle. A stratification, a destruction of 
professional ties is under way. You cannot apply the same class 
yardstick to everyone. The class approach is exceptionally 
important when analyzing social phenomena but, in today's 
conditions, it must unfailingly be combined with a 
cultural-historical, a sociopsychological approach. Only then 
can objective conclusions be drawn. 
  I would like to say that all our scientific research centers 
are now working on the elaboration of new parameters -- in 
Moscow, in Leningrad, in Novosibirsk.... Many contemporary 
questions would be impossible to answer by applying only the 
class approach. This is why all parties, movements, and streams 
find it so difficult to produce new programs. Programs must 
reflect the qualitatively new realities which have emerged both 
in our own country and all over the world. 
  Incidentally, our adversaries are not so hampered by tunnel 
vision. For example, following a careful study of the entire 
psychological profile of Russian man as manifested since the 
times of Batu Khan, Napoleon, and Hitler, they conclude: 
Russian man cannot be defeated in open face-to-face battle. 
They start seeking different methods. We found ourselves 
unprotected from above. The absolute majority of people were 
unable to believe, for example, Gorbachev's treason: How could 
the supreme statesman betray allies, friends, the Army, the 
party, all and sundry.... Apparently he could.... A ramified 
fifth-column structure was created, which fragmented our entire 
nationwide organism. The split followed not straightforward 
social lines but a more complex path. 
  There were times when Rus was being split along religious 
lines; nowadays we not only have preachers from overseas 
attacking our faith, but also attempts to effect splits along 
national and territorial lines. And if they succeed in 
splitting Russia and Ukraine or the Orthodox and the Muslim 
beyond all reconciliation, it will be virtually impossible to 
bring society together again. 
  With all this information in our possession, my colleagues 
and I spoke on television, asking people to refrain from 
provocative actions in any direction, I spoke on several 
occasions to an audience of many thousands at the House of 
Soviets in an attempt to persuade them: Any move from here 
could be used by the authorities as a pretext to open fire and 
finally destroy the Soviet power. The regime was eagerly 
seeking a pretext to open fire for effect. The majority 
accepted my point of view. Many people, by the way, did not 
know that the state of emergency had already been introduced at 
1600 on 3 October, at a time when the demonstrators had not yet 
marched on City Hall and had no plans to move to Ostankino. Nor 
did people know, of course, that several hundred Spetsnaz troops 
were already in place along the approaches to Ostankino, lying 
in wait for the demonstrators. Had the regime not wanted a 
bloodbath, it would have been enough to get one armored 
personnel carrier out in the road, fire a few blank rounds, and 
avoid mass murder. Many people do not know that the snipers, 
who were shown every day on television being rounded up, 
suddenly vanished from our side and disappeared whence they had 
come. Thus, the absence of full information gives some people 
an opportunity to interpret this address today any way they 
fancy. Would it not be better to admit that this warning saved 
hundreds of innocent people? 
  [Chikin] How do you feel now in the circle of Communist 
opponents and oppositionists? Can you reach mutual 
understanding? Are personal sympathies maintained? 
  [Zyuganov] It is obvious that everyone has reassessed his 
values and relationships over these years. I am grateful that I 
was not betrayed by my friends -- whether people from my native 
region who supported me during the difficult year, fellow 
journalists, or my friends from the alliance of people's 
patriotic forces. Even though I was frequently the target of 
critical fire -- sometime deservedly, sometime not. But I am an 
advocate of pooling the efforts of the broadest and most diverse 
political streams and of all my comrades from the left-wing bloc 
for the creation of a mighty state-patriotic organization. I 
maintain weekly contacts with friends and close associates from 
Belorussia [Belarus], Ukraine, Crimea, the Transcaucasus, and 
Central Asia and, as a rule, we reach complete mutual 
understanding on all main issues. 
  There is a narrow group of individuals here in Moscow, who 
are trying to imply that they hold the ultimate truth and they 
alone are ardent revolutionaries. But the number of their 
supporters is dwindling day by day. For the simple reason that 
it is virtually impossible to succeed just with bombastic 
phrases and speeches, without powerful structures, without 
coordinated policy, and without soundly considered tactics. 
  [Chikin] The situation in the country is extremely 
difficult. Each hour is precious when it comes to turning the 
helm and avoiding disaster. Say an opportunity to join the 
government were to arise tomorrow, would you accept? On what 
conditions? 
  [Zyuganov] I believe that, from the viewpoint of 
administration, the main evil is the new pyramid of power. The 
incumbent presidency is rule by general secretary and czar 
rolled into one. The general secretary feared the congress, the 
czar feared God's anger, but the power here is neither 
accountable to nor monitored by anyone. There is no government 
in the normal sense of the word. You could even say that there 
are four governments. There is a government which works around 
Yeltsin, which decides everything and is in command of those 
bearing arms. There is Chernomyrdin's government which runs the 
Gazprom and another two or three economic structures. There is 
Kozyrev's government which, basically speaking, is guided by 
instructions from the U.S. Department of State. There is also 
the mass media government controlled by "Russia's Choice" -- the 
democrats will hold onto this mighty power, which orchestrates 
Russia's troubles, until the very last.... 
  Thus, I would like to say that if these governments continue 
to function in the same way, no one -- not even the most 
talented person -- will be able to resolve a single issue. 
Generally speaking, this is not a question of who should join 
the administration, but rather of changing the structure and 
nature of power, of subordinating this power to the interests of 
the people, to the national-state interests. In my report to 
the conference of the "Accord for Russia" movement I actually 
spoke of the nature of state power and submitted a whole series 
of specific proposals which, it seems to me, could transform the 
way the country is being run. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- The intention of Russian 
journalists to adopt a code of professional ethics "inspires 
confidence that democracy is alive and kicking," Federation 
Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said when speaking today at a 
congress of Russian journalists. Stressing that the political 
freedom of the media is sealed in the Constitution, he 
reaffirmed that the economic situation places dependence on 
journalists. Many political groups, who, via financial 
institutions and banks are trying to take the press in hand, are 
rushing to take advantage of this. According to Vladimir 
Shumeyko, they are being driven by the desire to create their 
own image in the run-up to the presidential elections. There 
are a large number of claimants to the seat of president. 
  The head of the Federation Council said that the upper 
chamber of parliament stands for protecting the rights of 
journalists and their economic independence. He said that the 
state is committed to giving tax benefits to the "fourth 
estate," for "one cannot equate the media with consumer goods 
production." 
  Vladimir Shumeyko also noted that it is precisely 
journalists 
who must become one of the creators of a nation concept which 
would unite Russians, would fill a spiritual vacuum and inspire 
confidence in tomorrow. With such an idea, economic problems 
would be solved much more effectively, Vladimir Shumeyko said.

<F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report under the "Economy" rubric: "Boris </F>
Fedorov Points to Standstill in Reforms. World Economic Forum 
Winds up in Moscow"] 
  [Text] The work of the World Economic Forum winds up in 
Moscow today. The Forum opened in the evening of the day before 
yesterday. The foreign and Russian entrepreneurs attending it, 
according to the organizers, set themselves the goal of "getting 
the feel of the mood of the Russian economy." Addresses by 
Russian political and business leaders were supposed to help the 
businessmen in that. On the opening day congress participants 
were addressed in Moscow's Metropol Hotel by Boris Fedorov, 
former finance minister; Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Duma 
"Yabloko" bloc; and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. 
Nikolay Travkin made periodic interventions from the floor. 
  The former finance minister voiced the opinion that the 
government in its present composition continues to adhere to the 
course of reforms chosen by Yegor Gaydar's team, however, there 
is no movement in many sectors, owing to which reform is rolling 
back. 
  In Boris Fedorov's view, the present parliament cannot work 
effectively to speed up reforms. "Russia has a need for new 
professional politicians," Mr. Fedorov stated. St. Petersburg 
Mayor Sobchak painted his city to the foreigners in roseate 
hues. According to him, the situation in the city is so 
favorable that it will soon host the Goodwill games. Mr. 
Travkin largely attributed the rampant crime to the development 
of entrepreneurship in Russia. 
  Listening to representatives of the Russian establishment 
were entrepreneurs representing the world's major companies in 
Russia. Most of them are already carrying out specific projects. 
According to Roger Gale, International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) representative in Moscow, international finance 
organizations have three to five more years left for active work 
on the market of investments in the Russian economy, following 
which, the IFC representative believed, the key positions in the 
country will be taken by Russian financiers.

<F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report: "Some Presidential Edicts Are Crude. </F>
Glazyev's Report Under Discussion at the Economic-Mathematical 
Studies Center"] 
  [Text] Yet another discussion of the report "Main 
Guidelines of State Economic Policy," which was drawn up by a 
group of authors under Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State 
Duma Committee on Economic Policy, was held yesterday at the 
Economic-Mathematical Studies Center. 
  The discussion was attended by scientists from the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, State Duma deputies, officials from various 
Russian ministries, and also businessmen. 
  Sergey Glazyev's report was devoted to problems concerning 
reform of the Russian economy and also proposals aimed at 
improving it. Mr. Glazyev repeated his proposals that the state 
fine-tune the "mechanism of market self-organization" by 
regulating markets, supporting enterprises engaged in 
nonprofitmaking activity, and transferring the management rights 
over commercial state institutions to a special State Property 
Fund. 
  The report submitted for discussion also contained proposals 
aimed at adjusting the pension system, combating inflation, and 
reversing the slump in production by giving greater subsidies to 
state-owned enterprises. Speakers from among the report's co- 
authors suggested, in particular, that the system of tax 
collection be changed so as to collect half of government 
revenues by levying charges on the use of natural resources and 
environmental taxes. 
  In a conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent, Mr. Glazyev also touched on the president's 
recent economic edicts. In his view, these are steps in the 
right direction, but some of the edicts are still crude. In his 
words, laws to be enacted by the Federal Assembly will "set the 
edicts right." In addition, Boris Yeltsin's edicts were largely 
based on the 50 bills that were passed to the president by the 
State Duma last winter "for consultations," the State Duma 
committee chairman said. 
  Shortly the parliament is scheduled to discuss the first 
presidential economic packages, draft federal laws, and 
amendments to existing laws. In particular, they will consider 
the problems of foreign investment, the customs code, and 
foreign economic activity. 
  State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada, member of the "12 
December" faction, commented on the discussion of the 
"guidelines" as follows: "I like in Mr. Glazyev's program the 
pension proposal whereby people will be paid state pensions that 
will be set in accordance with a subsistence level, and extra 
money will be allocated from private pension funds. I cannot 
imagine, however, how, given the proposed subsidies, state 
enterprises could compete with each other; moreover, where is 
the guarantee that another government would be better equipped 
to tackle the problems the current one cannot solve?"

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today, the heads of the International Reform 
Foundation subjected the first stage of Russian privatization to 
diverse criticism. This was done at the presentation of a 
weighty report which is due tomorrow to land on the desks of the 
president, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, heads of 
administrations, bankers, and CIS leaders. 
  In the view of the report's authors, the government's 
actions 
in the privatization sphere have been justified in the formal 
sense but, given the lack of an overall strategy for 
development, the haphazard nature of the measures and the fact 
that they are even divorced from reality, and given the general 
loss of control in the socio-economic sphere, Chubays-style 
headlong privatization is having quite the opposite results. 
Criminal economic structures are emerging instead of a layer of 
private owners. There are no major enterprises which could 
boast of success. Investment in industry is falling. There is 
no link between economic market processes and federative 
relations. The economists demand that the Russian authorities 
clarify the objectives of privatization and national priorities.

  [Text] Russia's state statistical service has reviewed the 
country's development in the first six months of the year. It 
says that a kind of record was set. Inflation dropped to the 
lowest level in all of the two and a half years of reform. It 
amounted to 6.9 percent. At the same time, through tough 
financial measures, the government has been able to slow down 
the growth of prices. But as the government experts say, it is 
too early to celebrate victory. In the same period there's been 
a record high bank emission. Almost four trillion more rubles 
were put into circulation. Experts say that such a big wave of 
money that are not backed by commodities or services could tell 
on the home market in two or three months.

  [Text] At today's meeting of the cabinet, Oleg Soskovets, 
Russian first deputy prime minister, voiced his dissatisfaction 
with the Ministry of Fuel and Power Engineering's position while 
discussing the issue of how enterprises and organizations were 
preparing for the fall and winter period. According to him, the 
panic-stricken pronouncements by the ministry's representative 
to the effect that we will not survive this winter can mean only 
one thing: Such people should be found who will be able to 
organize work in a new way.
