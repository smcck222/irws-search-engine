<F P=106> [Unattributed report based on figures supplied by Russian </F>
Federation Government's Center for Economic Conditions: 
"Inflation, Are You Sleeping Or Finished?"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation Government's Center for 
Economic Conditions reports that, according to figures from 
state statistical organs, the overall inflation rate was 100.8 
percent over the past week, 102.8 percent since the start of the 
month, and up 1.8 times since the start of the year. Price 
growth was approximately identical for foodstuffs, nonfood 
goods, and paid services to the population. 
  We congratulate our readers -- the past week saw the lowest 
level of inflation (0.8 percent) in the past 30 months. 
  Consumer prices of goods and services in the Central 
Chernozem, Volga, and Urals Regions remained virtually at last 
week's level, and in four economic regions they changed by less 
than 1 percent. Only in the Northern, Central, Volgo-Vyatka, and 
West Siberia Regions was their growth slightly over 1 percent. 
  The most marked increase last week was for fruit (up 4.9 
percent), groats, pasta, and salt (up 1.7 percent), and bread 
and loaves (up 1.3 percent). 
  Prices of butter, vegetable oil, fish, and vodka did not 
increase. Eggs were 2 percent cheaper compared with the end of 
May. 
  The average cost of a basket of 19 of the most important 
foodstuffs as of 14 June was 56,000 rubles [R] over the month -- 
an increase of 1.1 percent on the week, of 3.8 percent since the 
start of the month, and of 80 percent since the start of the 
year. The basket cost R53,900 in the official trading network, 
and R68,700 at markets, stalls, or from private traders (in 
other words, still 30 percent dearer). The spread between the 
maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different Russian 
cities was 260 percent (as against 250 percent in the previous 
week). 
  The most "expensive" area in terms of the cost of the basket 
is still the Far East Economic Region -- R91,200 over the month. 
The basket cost R43,200 -- or less than half as much -- in the 
"cheapest" region (Central Chernozem Region). 
  The biggest increase in the cost of the basket in Russian 
regions was in the North Caucasus and East Siberia Regions -- up 
by 6.3 and 4.3 percent respectively. There was hardly any 
increase at all in the cost of the basket for the residents of 
the Volgo-Vyatka, Central Chernozem, and Volga Regions. 
  In Moscow the cost of the basket of 19 of the most important 
foodstuffs was up by 4.4 percent over the week to stand at 
R63,800 at 14 June. There was hardly any increase in the cost 
of the basket in St. Petersburg -- its cost there being R55,300. 
Moscow moved up from 36th to 30th on the list of cities 
surveyed, while St. Petersburg is in 50th place (49th last week). 
  Prices for nonfood goods also increased minimally -- by just 
0.9 percent. The largest increases over the week were for 
wallpaper, medicine, and matches (up 3 percent) and for 
children's knitwear and summer footwear (up 2 percent). Fuel 
prices were unchanged. 
  The differences in the price dynamics of nonfood goods in 
different economic regions were insignificant last week. Prices 
of nonfood goods increased by between 0.2 percent in the East 
Siberia Region and 1.6 percent in the Volgo-Vyatka Region. 
Moreover, price growth for industrial goods was higher than the 
Russian average in the Central Chernozem, Central, Urals, and 
West Siberia Regions. 
  The "costliest" cities in terms of prices of nonfood goods 
continue to be Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, 
Novyy Urengoy, Yakutsk, and Magadan.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The Russian Government has 
approved amendments to the existing legislature at its session 
today. A law on the status of servicemen was adopted 
practically without debates and a resolution was adopted to 
submit the law to the president for signing. 
  If the Russian president signs the law, amendments will be 
made to Russian laws on pensions, freedom of religion, income 
tax, tax on property and land, law on employment and the land 
code of the Russian Federation. 
  These amendments will give a number of privileges in social 
welfare to servicemen and their families, envisaged by the 
Russian law on the status of servicemen, taking into account the 
specifics of a military service. 
  In an interview to journalists after the government session 
was over, Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said that all 
privileges earlier granted to servicemen will remain in force.

  [Text] According to a report today from the Russian Navy's 
press center, command and staff training in administering 
Russia's armed forces was carried out in keeping with an 
operational training plan for the period of 21-22 June, under 
the leadership of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the supreme 
commander in chief. During the training a strategic purpose 
guided missile cruiser [raketnyy podvodnyy kreyser 
strategicheskogo naznacheniya] of the Northern Fleet launched, 
on the command of the commander in chief, a ballistic missile 
from the waters of the Barents Sea to Kamchatka area. It is 
reported that the missile head arrived at the predetermined 
destination. The launching was carried out in an ordinary 
manner. 
  Similar exercises also took place at the state missile 
testing ground at Plesetsk. For the first time in the entire 
history of the strategic purpose missile troops, journalists 
observed the launching of the Topol SS-25 intercontinental 
ballistic missile, which will become the basis of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces before the year 2005. It is the 
purpose of the exercises to develop a system of monitoring and 
tracking and to check the reliability of the military equipment. 
The 45-tonne missile was launched towards a training target 
situated on the Kamchatka peninsula. Its nuclear warhead 
weighing practically a tonne is capable of striking the target 
with an accuracy of a few meters. 
  The missile also works well for peaceful purposes. In the 
autumn of this year the refitted Topol will put a 
radio-technical satellite into near-Earth orbit. When the 
missile has served its military term, the missile will launch a 
satellite a second time. In the future this will allow Russia 
to resolve two tasks simultaneously: in accordance with the 
START-II treaty, to cut down nuclear armaments and to create a 
launch vehicle for space satellites without enormous expense. 
One only needs to add that today's exercises were absolutely 
peaceful ones. The unarmed warhead, which struck the target 
precisely, did not harm anyone.

<F P=106> [Report by Pavel Felgengauer in the "Defense" column: </F>
"Russian Nuclear Triad Ready for Action. President Yeltsin 
Presses `Red Button' for First Time"] 
  [Text] The latest annual command staff exercise on control 
of the Russian Federation Strategic Nuclear Forces, held 21-22 
June at the Russian Army General Staff with the participation of 
the main staffs of the Navy, the Air Force, and the Strategic 
Missile Forces (the sea, air, and ground components of the 
strategic nuclear triad), differed markedly from the previous 
ones. Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov told SEGODNYA's 
correspondent that for the first time the country's top civilian 
official -- the supreme commander (the president) -- personally 
directed the national Strategic Nuclear Forces. This is without 
precedent in the entire existence of Soviet nuclear weapons. 
  On the morning of 22 June -- a notable day in Russia's 
history -- during the final stage of the exercise, Boris Yeltsin 
arrived at the General Staff accompanied by his national 
security adviser Yuriy Baturin and, according to General 
Kolesnikov, "personally exercised control" from the General 
Staff Central Command Post. According to the military, "the 
president showed a deep understanding on matters of the control 
of strategic forces and issued guidance on improving the 
Strategic Nuclear Forces taking into account the bilateral 
agreements with the United States and Great Britain on missile 
retargeting." 
  Then the president returned to the Kremlin, canceling a 
scheduled meeting with the press, so his personal impressions 
about how the famous nuclear button operates remain unknown to 
the broad public. Meanwhile, the country's top military 
leadership went to "a command post at one branch of the armed 
forces to rehearse one element," and with that the training 
session was successfully concluded. 
  According to the chief of General Staff, the exercise showed 
that the Russian Federation nuclear triad and early warning 
system are "ready to address the tasks assigned in accordance 
with existing regulations."

<F P=106> [Correspondents Aleksandr Gerasimov and Nikolay Federov </F>
report from the Plesetsk test ground] 
  [Text] [Gerasimov] Just like everything else in the world, 
strategic missiles are getting old as well. The most modern of 
them -- the Topols -- have been given 15 years of life by their 
constructors, after which they will be scrapped. It is unlikely 
that these missiles will come under the treaty on cutting 
offensive weapons. Today, Russia has no money to create new 
nuclear systems. 
  Scientists at the Kompleks scientific-technical center, 
which 
created the SS-25, and now in financial crisis like the majority 
of their colleagues in the defense industry, have decided to 
earn money with the elderly missiles. The Topols that have been 
taken out of active service are being purchased with credits 
from the Defense Ministry, and START-II space rockets will be 
built, based on these missiles. 
  The Plesetsk cosmodrome has the chance to become a 
cosmodrome 
twice over. Previously, all space work was carried out by 
officers in the military-space forces. Taking part in the 
START-II program are workers from the Plesetsk test ground and a 
structural unit in the Strategic Missile Troops. The 
departmental division of the two sections of the Defense 
ministry barely allows them to unite their space efforts. 
  In the meantime, such an unnaturally long rocket can carry 
cargoes weighing up to 1.5 tonnes into space from unprepared 
launch sites, and is capable of working anywhere on the planet. 
So we have learned that a project is being developed to launch 
a South African satellite from the territory of the Republic of 
South Africa. However, in order to enter the market with new 
launch vehicles, it is necessary to confirm its reliability. 
The developers are counting on the reliability of the SS-25 
base rocket, which was last launched on Wednesday [22 June].

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 23 Jun -- Preparations for the launch of a 
"Start" missile within a conversion program for the use of 
weapons systems for peaceful purposes have started. The 
preparations are under way at the state test range of strategic 
missile troops in Mirnyy, Arkhangel Oblast. In an exclusive 
interview with an ITAR- TASS correspondent, Lieutenant General 
Yuriy Zhuravlev, head of the test range, said that henceforth 
"Topol" missiles would not be destroyed after their service 
life. According to him, after modification at the factory, each 
system will be used for placing non-military satellites into 
near-earth orbit. 
  Using extra-budgetary funds, enterprises of the defense 
complex have carried out experimental and design work to improve 
"Topol" specifications and presented an experimental specimen 
for tests at the state test range of strategic missile troops. 
In Gen. Zhuravlev's view, a new rocket, named "Start," has been 
developed. It has a strictly peaceful purpose promising great 
economic benefits to Russia. Contracts for launching 
communications satellites, worth many millions, have already 
been signed with South Africa and other countries. 
  In Gen. Zhuravlev's view, the "Start" can put satellites in 
orbit from anywhere in the world. Its movable platform and 
control block can be carried by different transport vehicles. 
Preparations for a launch take no more than several minutes. 
After test range trials the "Start" will put a satellite in 
orbit, and this will be the first step in using the famous 
"Topol" system for peaceful purposes. The launch is to take 
place somewhere in September, and in the meantime preparations 
for using this unique Russian missile system in a new role are 
in full swing, Lt.-Gen. Zhuravlev said.

<F P=106> [Report by R.S. under the "In Brief" rubric: "5 Percent of </F>
Required Amount Earmarked for Conversion So Far"] 
  [Text] On 21 June at the State Committee for the Defense 
Industry [Gosoboronprom] a meeting took place of participants in 
the trilateral commission that early this year produced and 
signed the first tariff agreement regulating relations between 
the employers, in the shape of Gosoboronprom, trade unions in 
defense industry sectors, and the government, as represented by 
the Ministry of Labor. It had to be held because of the 
disastrous situation with regard to implementing the main points 
of the agreement. In particular, the state has not paid its 
debt of 441 billion rubles [R] for military equipment produced 
as part of the 1993 defense order. 
  The situation is made considerably worse by the fact that 
now, when the 1995 state defense order is nearly a fifth of last 
year's, there have also been considerable cuts in the funds 
earmarked for military conversion. Out of the R4.7 trillion 
required this year to carry through conversion programs, as 
little as R0.25 trillion was appropriated in the first quarter 
-- slightly more than 5 percent of the intended sum. The 
funding of research and development on weapons and military 
hardware was not indexed in the first six months, although this 
is enshrined in the tariff agreement and is on the whole being 
done in Russia's national economy. 
  The main reason for the failure to act on the tariff 
agreement provisions noted by virtually all participants in the 
meeting lies in the current structure of the draft Russian 
budget being discussed in the State Duma. The main culprit in 
the prevailing situation, trade unions in defense sectors think, 
is the Russian Government, which is not living up to its 
pledges. This will soon provoke heightened social tension in 
the regions where the main defense enterprises are located, the 
Gosoboronprom press service says.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Batuyev under the "Problem" rubric: </F>
"`Outcasts' Wait for Somebody To Take Care of Them. Delay 
Fraught With Danger"] 
  [Text] Russia never had nuclear submarines in the Black or 
Baltic Seas. So after the Soviet Union broke up none of them 
was inherited by the former Union republics. Over the next few 
years Russia alone will have to recycle more than 200 of these 
craft containing a considerable quantity of radioactive waste. 
This is required by both START-II and the fact that the service 
life of the submarines, many of which are still afloat, has come 
to an end. But it turns out that at present Russia still cannot 
comply with START-II promptly, in an environmentally clean 
fashion, and at the same time to its economic advantage: There 
is no appropriate technology that can be universally applied. 
There are programs and government decrees, but extremely poor 
financing hinders their implementation. The recycling of 
submarines is a loss-making process. In addition, the Navy -- 
the latest owner of the equipment, although technically it is 
owned by the State Committee for the Management of State 
Property -- does not keep track of the degree to which all 
required parts of the equipment are present. It is received for 
recycling without parts and circuits containing nonferrous and 
precious metals, such as gold, silver, and copper.... In 
addition, the recycling has to be done by the so-called 
"roundabout" method: After a submarine is placed on the stocks, 
the reactor compartment is cut off, but associated redundant 
compartments are retained. The reactor compartment is then 
sealed and thrown into the water. Hence the term "outcast." 
They will remain in the water until the Defense Ministry builds 
long-promised storage facilities for them. The Defense 
Ministry, in turn, is waiting for money from the state to do so. 
  Currently there are around 30 nuclear submarines and 
"outcasts" subject to recycling underwater near large cities, 
such as Severodvinsk and Bolshoy Kamen, and the village of 
Snezhnogorsk. Each of them is kept afloat thanks to municipal 
electric power, thus causing economic damage to the state. Once 
the power is turned off the "outcasts" will run aground, and the 
possible seal failure (after 30 years in service) may cause a 
discharge of radioactive waste. Each submarine (of the earlier 
types) contains 300-400 cubic meters of radioactive waste 
measuring from 100,000 to 1 million curie, whereas the safe 
level for discharging such waste into the water stands at 10 
curie (to the power of minus 9). The overall quantity of 
radioactive waste awaiting recycling has been estimated by 
specialists at 2,200 cubic meters in Severodvinsk, 2,000 cubic 
meters in Bolshoy Kamen, and 93 cubic meters in Snezhnogorsk. 
In the coming years another 200 or so submarines will be 
decommissioned in the Navy.

  [Text] Flight Control Centre (Moscow region) June 24 TASS 
-- The Russian cosmonauts continue their mission aboard the Mir 
space station. 
  They conducted geophysical, astrophysical, technological and 
medical experiments this week. The crew was also preparing the 
ballistic capsule of the Progress M-23 ferry for its return to 
the earth. 
  Friday's programme of work includes astrophysical 
experiments 
to study gamma-radiation flows of galactic origin and 
investigation of properties of various materials in open space. 
  Under the medical control programme, investigations will be 
conducted to check up water-salt metabolism and to take clinical 
blood analysis of cosmonauts who experienced zero-gravity 
conditions for a long time. 
  Work in space proceeds according to a preset programme. The 
cosmonauts are healthy and feel well.

  [Text] Tehran, 23 Jun -- The discussion of individual 
points of the cease-fire agreement is proceeding extremely 
slowly. The draft of the agreement was proposed by Romero 
Piriz-Ballon, special envoy of the UN secretary general in 
Tajikistan during the second round of the Tajik talks in the 
Iranian capital. The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned this 
from well-informed sources. 
  One of the leaders of the Tajik Islamic opposition, Haji 
Akbar Turajonzoda --who is in Tehran at present but is not 
directly involved in the talks -- explained the views of the 
government opposition in an interview with ABRAR newspaper. The 
opposition believes, he said, that the cease-fire must be 
temporary and limited and must last just for the duration of the 
talks, that is, until 27 June. Dushanbe does want a prolonged 
cease-fire, because this would be in the interests of the 
government. The fact is that, during the summer season the 
units of the opposition forces want to bring their forces into 
action. 
  Taking this into account the cease-fire would cause great 
damage to a number of the opposition's demands: The liberation 
of the arrested opposition activists, the removal of the ban on 
activities of the political parties, and the closure of criminal 
proceedings instituted against their representatives. In 
addition, the cease-fire must be abided by not only on the 
Tajik-afghan border but also on the whole of the territory of 
the republic. The government and Russian troops must renounce 
warfare methods with the opposition under the pretext of its 
desire to combat crime. It is also necessary that these troops 
should not leave their bases. 
  Despite all the obstacles, the opposition leader stressed, 
we 
want the talks to be successful. Because that is in the 
interests of the Tajik people.

  [Text] After over five days of inter-Tajik negotiations, 
which started on June 18 in Tehran, the parties have failed to 
find any mutually acceptable decision, an expert from the Tajik 
opposition reported to Interfax Thursday. 
  He called the proposal of Dushanbe to initiate unilateral 
disarmament of the opposition's armed formations as unacceptable. 
  For its part, the Tajik opposition proposed to start 
bilateral disarmament under the supervision of representatives 
from the UN, CSCE, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Kazakhstan, 
the expert said. The opposition insists that the Interior and 
Security Ministries' forces be disarmed as well. The opposition 
proposes that Russian forces carry out the functions of the 
republic's security bodies during a replacement of the staffs of 
those bodies. 
  The expert added that the parties continue examining 
proposals on a cease-fire brought forward by the UN General 
Secretary Special Envoy Ramiro Piriz Ballon. 
  Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax Akbar 
Turadzhonzoda, co-chairman of the Movement for Tajikistan's 
Islamic Revival, declared that the opposition "does not strive 
for power" and is ready to participate in national elections. 
However, as he said, it is necessary to permit the activity of 
all political parties, to publish newspapers irrespective of 
their political orientation, and to release political prisoners 
in order to hold these elections. 
  A popular government, made up of those who have not stained 
themselves by "the fratricide war," should rule the country 
during the preparation for the elections and adoption of the 
republic's Constitution, Turadzhonzoda said.

  [Text] The second round of Tajikistan's peace talks, which 
were held in Tehran, have increased the hopes for a peaceful and 
just solution to Tajik crisis. 
  The talks have been held with the participation of 
government 
representatives and Tajik opposition groups in the presence of 
representatives from Russia and Central Asian countries and 
under the supervision of an envoy of the UN secretary-general. 
The aim of the talks is to find a formula to end the civil war 
that began in Tajikistan approximately two years ago. This 
crisis, which began after the collapse of the Tajik coalition 
government, not only resulted in the loss of lives and homes of 
thousands of Tajik people, but has also threatened regional 
security. It could involve the United States and other foreign 
countries, who are waiting for a chance to influence the region 
and create discord among the Muslim nations in the regional 
conflict. 
  Although the participation by the government and the 
opposition groups of Tajikistan in the peace talks, by itself, 
is considered appropriate, true progress in the talks requires 
the official recognition of the Tajik people's right to 
determine their own fate and a response to their wishes for a 
democratic state based on accepted international norms and 
standards. 
  The establishment of a real peace in Tajikistan will only be 
possible if the Muslim Tajik nation builds the foundations of 
its desired government based on its believed principles and 
national and Islamic culture. It seems this need has been 
accepted in general terms by the Russian Government and other 
neighboring countries of Tajikistan and its own government. 
  In this regard the Islamic Republic of Iran in particular 
has 
played an important role in closing the gap between the stance 
of the government and the oppositions of Tajikistan. The 
Iranian Government began its efforts to seek peace at the 
outbreak of the Tajik civil war. At present Iran continues to 
play this sensitive and determining role by holding the second 
rounds of talks in Tehran. Without doubt the results of Tehran 
talks will pave the way for further developments in the third 
round of talks, which will be held in Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Qoroqi; place and date not given-- </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] The second round of Tajikistan's peace talks which 
started on Saturday [18 June] at the Foreign Ministry's 
Political and International Studies Department in Tehran is 
continuing and the two sides have reached some agreements on a 
cease-fire. On how the talks are progressing as well as on the 
prospects for peace in Tajikistan, we talked with Shukurjon 
Zuhurov and Otahon Latifi, the representatives of the government 
and of the opposition, respectively. 
  Mr. Latifi, please tell us what topics were covered in the 
major discussions in recent days and what progress has been made. 
  [Latifi, speaking in Tajik] The recent discussions 
concentrated on the fact that we are searching for peace and 
stability in our homeland. Of course, it is very difficult to 
achieve reconciliation without talks. As to what the outcomes 
will be, the future will tell. 
  [Qoroqi] It has been said that a temporary cease-fire until 
the conclusion of the talks has been agreed on. What is your 
opinion on the mechanism for this cease-fire? 
  [Latifi] A cease-fire mechanism has not yet been proposed. 
When it is proposed, it will be discussed with UN experts who 
are experienced in this field and it will be endorsed by us. 
  [Qoroqi] We also interviewed the Tajik Government 
representative Shukurjon Zuhurov. Mr. Zuhurov, as the 
representative of the Tajik Government at the peace talks, you 
have heard what Mr. Latifi had to say. How acceptable do you 
think these proposals are for your government? 
  [Zuhurov, speaking in Tajik] I strongly support what Mr. 
Latifi said as far as establishing peace and stability in 
Tajikistan as soon as possible is concerned. I would like to 
say that today we feel that no one but the Tajiks themselves can 
establish peace and stability in our homeland. We can be 
assisted. But lasting peace can be established in Tajikistan 
only when the Tajiks are reconciled with each other, when 
general and national satisfaction is gained, and when the Tajiks 
live as one nation in this country. 
  Thus, the second round of talks started in Iran--in the land 
of the people who we feel want to help us very much--and we 
started to solve the problems that were listed in the agenda of 
our first round of talks in Moscow. And one of the major 
problems, as you stated and as was heard in Mr. Latifi's 
remarks, was establishing a cease- fire and efforts toward this. 
We started discussions on this today and, God willing, we will 
reach an outcome. 
  [Qoroqi] The opposition underlines the need to dissolve the 
government and to hold free elections. In your capacity as the 
representative of the government, what is your opinion on this? 
  [Zuhurov] Elections should be free and democratic overall. 
If not, they cannot achieve tranquility. We have not yet 
discussed how the elections will be held and the participation 
of all the people of Tajikistan in the elections. We will try 
to speed up these discussions because we have lost a lot of time.

  [Text] Dushanbe June 24 TASS -- The Friday attack on a bus 
with children of Russian military serving in Tajikistan was "a 
planned terrorist act" and a "continuation of the well-planned 
and controlled terror against Russian troops deployed in 
Tajikistan," according to Vladimir Novikov, deputy commander of 
the Russian frontier troops in the Central Asian republic. 
  Several Russian military have fallen victim to the terrorist 
campaign only in the first four days of June. The latest attack 
on the bus with some 30 kids and their parents did not harm any 
of the passengers, however a passer-by was killed and several 
others wounded. Unknown gunmen fired a grenade on the bus early 
on Friday. 
  Novikov told reporters that Russian troops will mount 
protection of their personnel by seting up additional guarding 
posts and patrols in places where Russian servicemen live. He 
added that armoured vehicles will be used for protection. 
  Novikov stressed that the leadership of the Russian frontier 
troops in Tajikistan is preparing a statement in connection with 
the attack on the bus. 
  Russian border guards defend the Tajik-Afghan border to cut 
short the infiltration of armed Tajik opposition militants from 
Afghanistan.

  [Text] China will develop its relations with other 
countries on the basis of principles of peaceful coexistence. 
Rong Yiren, vice president of the People's Republic of China, 
said this during his meeting with the Tajik Supreme Soviet 
delegation headed by Abdulmajid Dostiyev, first vice chairman of 
the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, which is currently visiting 
China. 
  Rong Yiren expressed satisfaction at the development of 
relations between the two countries following the establishment 
of diplomatic relations. He said Tajikistan and China, as 
developing countries, (?ought) to develop their national 
economies and enhance the standards of living of their peoples. 
We should develop relations and expand cooperation with other 
countries. He said the Chinese economy is developing fast and 
the standard of living is improving. However, despite this, 
there is still a large gap between Chinese economic growth and 
the standard of living, and the standard of living in developed 
countries. [passage indistinct] 
  Dostiyev said the main objective of the Tajik parliamentary 
delegation's visit to the PRC is to familiarize themselves with 
Chinese experiences on social and economic reforms. 
  Informed sources said that the head of Tajik delegation 
explained the situation in Tajikistan and the position of the 
Tajik Government vis-a-vis the inter-Tajik talks that are 
continuing in Tehran during his meetings with Chinese officials. 
  According to Chinese experts, military actions that are 
taking place between the Tajik Government and the Tajik Islamic 
opposition are causing serious concern in Beijing. It is 
believed that the continuation of armed clashes there could 
destabilize the situation along the Tajik-Chinese border. 
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, during 
his meeting with the Tajik delegation, said that China has an 
interest in seeing the border between the two countries be 
transformed into a border of peace, stability, friendship, and 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andray Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] The country's government decided not to submit for a 
while to parliament its program of speeding up the reform and 
pulling out of the economic crisis. This decision was made 
following the criticism President Nursultan Nazarbayev leveled 
at the program. He told the government to update it in the 
light of proposals made by every government member. Every 
minister will have to sign the program and then bear 
responsibility for its implementation. 
  Nazarbayev was confident that the anti-crisis program had to 
dictate the government's tactics for the coming 12 to 15 months. 
The goal is to cut the monthly inflation rate to below 10 
percent. He thought that the production decline could not be 
overcome unless Kazakhstan's own producers and entrepreneurs 
were encouraged. 
  The government decided to discuss the anti-crisis program 
again next week. 
  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko presented to 
parliament a memorandum on the government's socio-economic 
policy. He said that Kazakhstan had exhausted the domestic 
sources of financing for reforming its economy. Therefore, he 
thought, the country needs foreign credits. Preparations for 
them will take 15 months, he explained. Tereshchenko said that 
the government would act in three stages during that period. 
  At the first stage, from June to December 1994, the 
government will rely chiefly on domestic resources for budget 
financing. Within that time inflation will be reduced to below 
10 percent and the tenge, the national currency, would be 
stabilized to some extent. 
  At the second stage, from January to September 1995, the 
government expects an agreement on medium-term credits to be 
signed, an accelerated integration with Russia and CIS member 
nations and investments by the G7 group. 
  The third stage will be the beginning of a new economic 
policy. The government intends to lay the foundation for an 
improvement of living standards and a production growth. 
  Tereshchenko emphasized that the government would pursue an 
unswerving anti-inflation policy, reduce taxes, carry out a bank 
reform and step up privatization. 
  He insisted that reforms could not be carried out without 
properly financing the social sphere, because otherwise society 
would reject them. He wanted parliament to support the budget 
and said that if the country stood by it, foreign loans would be 
easier to obtain. 
  Answering questions, Tereshchenko said he did not think the 
country could return to the ruble zone because of the 
significant differences between the Russian and Kazakh economies. 
  He called for introduction of a transnational CIS currency, 
the altyn, and added that this idea had been initially put 
forward by Nazarbayev in his draft plan of setting up a Eurasian 
Union. 
  Tereshchenko recalled that Kazakhstan had had to leave the 
ruble zone and introduce its own currency because, in his words, 
Russia had demanded a gift of nearly $1.5 billion. He said that 
the talks between Moscow and Minsk on the setting up of a ruble 
zone had been futile for nearly six months. 
  Tereshchenko thought, however, that a joint economic space 
and lifting customs duties inside the CIS would facilitate 
integration of CIS member nations.

  [Text] Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Sergey Tereshchenko 
believes that Kazakhstan cannot return to the ruble zone due to 
serious economic differences between Russia and Kazakhstan. 
  He told parliament on Thursday [23 June] that it would be 
beneficial to introduce a supra-national CIS currency -- the 
altyn. 
  He said that the idea of introducing the altyn had been 
proposed by President Nazarbayev and that Kazakhstan's 
withdrawal from the ruble zone and the introduction of its 
national currency was a forced measure, taken after Russia 
demanded about $1.5 billion from Kazakhstan. 
  He said that a single economic system must be created, and 
customs limitations lifted in the CIS, all of which will promote 
the integration of the CIS countries.

  [Text] Alma Ata [Almaty] 23 June TASS -- More than 20,000 
inhabitants of Kazakhstan have formally relinquished their 
citizenship. The number is not seen as considerable when 
compared to the Republic's total population -- only one in every 
85,000 people does not want to be a citizen of Kazakhstan, 
according to chief of the passport and visa department of the 
Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs Umirbai Musayev [name as 
received]. 
  The official said that most inhabitants of Kazakhstan will 
soon exchange Soviet-era passports for plastic identification 
cards for use inside the Republic. 
  Foreign travel passports will be issued only to those who 
have to travel for business or other reasons. Those who so wish 
may hold both a plastic ID and a travel passport. But while the 
former is issued for a token price, the latter will cost the 
individual a pretty penny. 
  Although the ID cards will carry information about the 
holder's citizenship, they can hardly be valid for travel even 
to the neighbouring countries. Free travel outside a republic 
is a moot question for the governments of the former Soviet 
countries.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] President Askar Akayev has asked the Finance 
Ministry to explore the opportunities for early subsidies to the 
hydro power plants under construction and to find about 30 
million soms (about $10 million) for the purpose. The order 
follows President Akayev's trip to the Jalalabad region in the 
south of the country in the middle of the week, the Presidential 
Press Service has told IF. 
  In the course of the trip Akayev met with workers of the 
"Narymgidroenergostroi" joint stock company. Hydro power plant 
construction workers have not been paid wages for many months 
and the situation is critical. The joint stock company is faced 
with the risk of a strike. 
  President Akayev visited a semi-conductor factory in 
Tash-Kumyr, where he met with city leaders and factory managers 
to discuss the possibility of subsidizing the expansion of this 
factory, one of the biggest producers of mono-crystals in the 
CIS. 
  The question of closing down unprofitable pits was discussed 
at President Akayev's meetings with Tash-Kumyr coal workers. 
  Experts blame the country's grave financial and economic 
position on inadequate taxation. Akayev asked the government to 
draft new tax legislation by September 1. 
  Presidential adviser on social and economic affairs, Talai 
Koichumanov has told IF that the adoption of a better system of 
taxation at the forthcoming session of parliament would be 
crucial to forming the budget for 1995 on fundamentally new 
principles. Koichumanov said the budget was the main tool of 
social-economic policies. He said that currently the treasury 
was receiving a mere half of the minimum necessary to keep the 
economy going and most of the budget revenue was spent on the 
social safety net for the population. 
  The presidential adviser said that the economic and 
financial 
position of Kyrgyzstan grave as it is, there has to be a 
comprehensive, stable and flexible tax legislation promptly 
responding to market changes. He hopes this would encourage 
private enterprise and increase budget revenues. 
  About the situation in individual branches of the economy 
the 
presidential adviser said that Kyrgyzstan's industries needed 
fundamental reconstruction. Some unprofitable enterprises will 
simply be closed down. 
  A full-scale agrarian reform, which, experts hope, will 
improve the situation in agriculture, can be launched no earlier 
than the autumn of 1994. 
  Koichumanov warns that structural reforms in the economy and 
urgent measures to increase production contained in the 
three-year-plan may end in failure, unless Kyrgyzstan receives 
favorable credits from the IMF, the World Bank and 
donor-countries. The Kyrgyz presidential adviser fears that in 
the near future his country may find itself in a position 
similar to that of many African countries having poorly 
developed industries, huge foreign debts and quick population 
growth in rural regions. The sole difference would be that 
Kyrgyzstan has a far higher education level. 
  T. Koichumanov strongly criticized the Cabinet for letting 
debts snowball. In 1993-1994 most credits were spend on the 
social sphere and on purchases of grain and fuel, and not on 
developing production. 
  However, the presidential adviser believes that Kyrgyzstan 
has certain chances of coping with the crisis. He sees a way 
out in attracting foreign credits and investments into the 
production sphere in carrying out realistic projects. He 
believes that only the maximum preferences for private 
investors, in particular, the biggest multi-national 
corporations, would attract foreign capital into Kyrgyzstan. 
  Presidential adviser Koichumanov believes that Kyrgyzstan 
should follow in the footsteps of Southeast Asian countries, 
which are expected to make a new economic leap in 2000 and the 
vacant niche in the world commodity production market of may be 
taken by Central Asian countries, including Kyrgyzstan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>
  [Text] Bishkek, 23 Jun -- The economic crisis in Kirghizia 
[Kyrgyzstan] continues to worsen. According to figures 
published today by the National Statistics Committee, total 
output in May fell by 27.8 percent compared with April. 
Sixty-five industrial enterprises have been at a standstill 
since the beginning of the year. Losses at unprofitable 
enterprises amount to 245.6 million soms. 
  Over 30,000 employees are sent on compulsory leave every 
month and about 34,000 are on short time. At the beginning of 
the year about 2,000 people were reporting every month to labor 
exchanges, but by the end of April this figure had doubled, and 
by the beginning of June it had risen to 15,800. Specialists 
reckon that unemployment is becoming a large-scale and chronic 
problem, especially among young people up to the age of 30. 
Since the beginning of the year, this category's share in total 
unemployment has risen by 150 percent. 
  Economic activity continues to decline in all sectors. There 
was a deficit of 298.2 million soms on the consolidated budget 
for the first four months of the year -- this is 10.5 percent of 
gross domestic product. 
  During January-April the Republic earned profit of 370.2 
million soms. But increased prices account for most of this. 
  Things are no better in agriculture. Meat production fell by 
almost 30 percent. Production of eggs has almost completely 
ceased. People have to buy them from private producers. Some 
economists had pinned their hopes on privatization, but they now 
say it is moving in a strange direction. Only 30 percent of the 
population have received vouchers or "shares," as they are 
called in Kirghizia. Even so, these people are in no hurry to 
make use of them. Privatized enterprises are either abandoning 
their original production profile or else coming to a complete 
standstill.

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The State Duma, the lower 
house of the Russian federal legislature, has finally approved 
the Russian federal budget for 1994 as a whole after months of 
debates. On Friday morning 273 deputies voted for it, with 80 
voting against and eight abstaining. Four deputies, who left 
their electronic voting cards behind, supported the vote in 
favour at the microphones in the hall. 
  The law provides for the spending of 194.5 trillion roubles 
and the revenue of 124.5 trillion roubles. It imposes a cap of 
70 trillion roubles on the budget deficit. 
  Following the approval by the Duma, the law will be 
forwarded 
to the Federation Council. 
  The budget-94 was eventually approved in the fourth round of 
voting after the earlier three rounds on Wednesday failed to 
give the seal of approval to the budget, which the deputies 
found lacking due allocations for defence, health care and 
education. 
  The Duma had to set an hour apart for voting on Friday and 
threatened sanctions to absentees. All scheduled trips were 
cancelled and those on business elsewhere were recalled to 
ensure the quorum.

  [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- A group of U.S. specialists 
finish their work in Riga on Wednesday after having got 
acquainted with the new installation of the Skrunda radar 
compound to prepare recommendations how to dismantle it and how 
much the dismantling will cost. 
  The American and Latvian experts coordinated the basic 
issues 
of two draft agreeements on the dismantling of the building, 
said Latvia's representative Aivars Vovers. As reported, the 
U.S. Government pledged 2 million USD to dismantle the facility. 
  Latvia will receive similar recommendations from Swedish 
experts who also visited the radar site this week. 
  Latvia should prepare itself a concept to channel the 
foreign 
assistance to the concrete dismantlers, which will be chosen 
during a competition, said Vovers. The time of the next meeting 
depends on the speed of processing of the acquired information. 
Latvia is interested in speeding up the process, Vovers noted.

Partnership for Peace plan. Lithuanian President Algirdas 
Brazauskas says in his 22 June statement that it's an important 
step in the strengthening of security in Europe based on 
cooperation and partnership, as well as new democratic relations 
on the continent. We hope that will help Central Europe, 
including the Baltic states, integrate into NATO, reads the 
statement of the Lithuanian president. 
  Mr. Brazauskas says Lithuania approves of NATO's initiative 
to take on a new role in stepping up security and stability in 
the region. According to the statement, Russia's step towards 
NATO means it will not be isolated in this process and no new 
military borders will be drawn in Europe.

  [Text] Kerkira (Corfu), 24 Jun -- A full-scale document 
comprising over 80 pages and translated into the 12 [as 
received] languages of the EU [European Union] member-countries 
has not yet been circulated in the press center in Kerkira. 
However, ITAR-TASS correspondents have learned from circles 
close to the Russian delegation that the main aim of the 
agreement is to facilitate trade, investments, and harmonious 
economic relations and to strengthen political and economic 
freedoms. 
  It follows from the agreement that a permanent political 
dialogue is being established between Russia and the EU, which 
both countries intend to develop and make more active. The 
document also envisages meetings between the Russian president 
and the chairmen of the EU Council and Commission. A political 
dialogue at parliamentary level is envisaged to be held twice a 
year. 
  The agreement plans to set up a cooperation council, which 
will monitor the implementation of this historic document. It 
will comprise members of the Russian Federation Government and 
leaders of the EU working bodies. A Parliamentary cooperation 
committee is also being set up. 
  The 10 sections of the agreement pay special attention to 
economic cooperation, including, in particular, articles on 
trade in nuclear materials and financial and cultural 
cooperation.

Malyshev, and Yuriy Malinov] 
  [Text] Kerkira (Corfu), 24 Jun -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin called the agreement on partnership and cooperation 
between the Russian Federation and the European Union a document 
of tremendous historical importance that had made it possible to 
take a decisive step toward restoring the unity of the European 
continent. He was speaking here today at the signing of the 
document with the leadership of the European Union. In the 
agreement, according to the Russian leader, the conditions and 
stages were precisely and clearly spelled out for Russia's 
return to economic Europe, moreover, "as an equal partner," as 
Yeltsin particularly stressed. This weighty document, comprising 
over 80 pages and 10 sections, had been prepared by expert 
specialists for signing for about two years. 
  Giving an appraisal of the agreement and the current 
economic 
and political situation on the continent, the Russian president 
noted that: The global political confrontation came to an end 
some years ago. But the consequences of the Cold War, according 
to him, continued to poison the international atmosphere. We 
have all begun to experience the growing threat of confrontation 
of a different kind. The system of closed trading within the 
framework of the former USSR and the CEMA quickly collapsed in 
the new conditions. The liberalization of economic life in 
Russia prompted our manufacturers to seek new markets in Europe. 
This, in Yeltsin's view, was creating an unpredictable 
situation in the trade in goods and services, in investment 
activities and so on. With the signing of the agreement, this 
threat is by-passing Europe, the Russian president emphasized, 
drawing particular attention to the fact that the European Union 
had rejected discriminatory approaches in economic ties with 
Russia. For its part, Russia, Yeltsin declared, had made a 
strategic choice in favor of integration into the world 
community and, primarily, with the EU. Today Russia is 
transforming itself into one of its most important partners. 
  In the opinion of the head of the Russian state, it is 
precisely Europe that is being called upon to teach the world an 
important lesson -- a lesson of real cooperation and a lesson of 
true unification of efforts in the field of the economy, 
ecology, and in settling conflicts. In this connection Yeltsin 
drew the attention of the EU leaders to the fact that Russia has 
a vital interest in stability in the West and in the center of 
Europe. We are actively cooperating with European institutions 
in attempts to settle the Yugoslav crisis, and the EU and all 
the European countries, the Russian leader stated, can rely on 
Russia in this sense. 
  Addressing the leaders of the EU countries, Yeltsin said 
that 
he is relying on their appropriate attitude, and that of all the 
CSCE partners, as regards stability in the east of the 
continent. Advocating a deepening of the processes of 
integration and a broadening of the EU, the Russian leader 
expressed the opinion that this would yield fruit if it does not 
lead to the isolation of a lesser Europe in a greater Europe, 
and if a similar approach is shown with regard to the processes 
of integration within the framework of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  In order to build a truly unified Europe and in order that 
the 21st century should become the first century of peace for 
our continent, Yeltsin stressed, the whole path of coordination 
of interests must be travelled to its end. Every stop half-way, 
he stressed, could mean that all previous efforts have been 
wasted. 
  The signing of the agreement on partnership and cooperation 
between Russia and the European Union has enabled Russia and the 
EU to enter a qualitatively new stage of mutual relations. The 
prospects for stage-by-stage economic integration have been 
defined by joint efforts. The crux of it, according to the 
Russian president, is an improvement in the conditions for the 
access of Russian goods into the EU markets, a dynamic 
advancement toward a free exchange of goods, capital and 
services, and the creation of a national regime for setting up 
companies and for their activities. 
  The signing of the agreement took place in St. George's 
Church and, as the Russian leader pointed out, this is more than 
just happy coincidence. May St. George the victorious, he said, 
help us to vanquish the remnants of mistrust between one another 
and to find a solution to common problems.

  [Text] Moscow June 23 TASS -- The director of Russia's 
External Intelligence Service (EIS), Yevgeniy Primakov, is 
already several days into an unofficial tour of North Africa, 
ITAR-TASS learned in the EIS press bureau. The EIS 
representative reported that Primakov had met with Yasir `Arafat 
in Tunis, and had also had a series of conversations with other 
political figures in various countries. 
  While the EIS director's tour is unofficial, his 
peace-keeping mission seems to be fully official. One of the 
most important questions discussed by Primakov during his 
meetings was the Middle East peace process. Primakov was 
assigned the job of talking to leaders in the troubled area not 
so much due to his position as EIS chief, but because he is one 
of Russia's top Middle East experts. 
  At the end of this week, Primakov is expected to return to 
Moscow.

President Leonid Kravchuk from the Kiev studio -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed electors. The time allocated for our main 
program theses is extremely short, and I think it is impossible 
to go over all of them. I am sure that you have read the 
programs; people have made up their minds and have a good idea 
of the programs through the media. Yet, a few words about the 
main theses. 
  I would divide my program and my work into three 
conventional 
parts. The first part, which I call "Development," is about the 
development of the economy, the development of society, and the 
development of relations between people. If we take the 
economic part, it is about creating equal conditions for all 
businesses and creating conditions to encourage production, 
because everything depends on production. To that end, we have 
already taken and will continue to take measures to give a boost 
to production. At the state level, it means the introduction of 
a new taxation system, a new system of prices and wages, customs 
duties, that is, everything we refer to the macrolevel. If we 
take sectors of production, we are talking about priorities. I 
am giving the top priority to the production of food and to 
energy provision. Without these, the national economy will not 
be able to function, and human life will be doomed. 
  I call my next part "Establishment of law and legality in 
society." Until we learn to respect the law, respect the 
Constitution, it will be hard to gain respect for each other. 
At the state level, for power structures, compliance with the 
law is mandatory, and those who do not obey the law must face 
the consequences, no matter in what branch of power they belong. 
Every citizen must follow certain norms, must respect certain 
principles, and work in a legal framework. If we take the most 
important thing, it is protection of the individual's life from 
the crime world, from infringement on its freedom and rights. 
Here, we must act promptly, act by legal means, by means of 
creating a rigid system of responsibility for those who make 
attempts on human life and taking steps appropriate for the 
situation. A war has been declared on us, and we must respond 
appropriately. 
  My third part is called "Peace and Concord in Society." Life 
is the most important and the dearest thing to everyone, and the 
entire system of legal principles, all legislative processes, 
all laws and the entire state policy must be aimed at securing 
peace and concord. Concord among people within the country, 
which is a must, unity and understanding. 
  As for outside factors, our policy must be aimed at 
establishing friendly partnership relations with all countries 
of the world, especially with our neighbors, above all, with 
Russia. I am convinced that Ukraine's political stability, its 
economic progress, its national security, and the development of 
democracy are impossible without establishing the kind of 
relations with our neighbors which would ensure these basic 
[word indistinct] in Ukraine. But we must take steps to 
persuade our neighbors, including such a major neighbor as 
Russia, to make Ukraine one of their priority countries. This 
is very important. As soon as we agree on this, as soon as 
Ukraine's policy and the policy of our neighboring states become 
more predictable, as soon as they become policies of concord and 
respect for one another, we will definitely live in peace, 
friendship and harmony. 
  Thank you for your attention.

  [Text] [Announcer] Our Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy 
held a news conference in Kiev today. Here is our correspondent 
Vasyl Kukurichka with his story. 
  [Kukurichka] At the news conference Vitaliy Radetskyy summed 
up the results of his official visit to the United States of 
America. As the defense minister pointed out, the visit was very 
rich in events and, in his opinion, it was fruitful for both 
sides. Ukrainian Radio World Service had informed its listeners 
in detail about the visit in progress, therefore, I will not 
repeat what has already been said about this. 
  So, what was the main objective of this visit, says 
Ukraine's 
Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy. 
  [Begin Radetskyy recording] Our delegation linked the main 
objective of its visit to the United States of America with the 
expansion and improvement of bilateral relations between the 
military departments, and also the fulfillment by the sides of 
the obligations assumed earlier. In particular, this refers to 
the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the 
United States, and Russia; to Ukraine's nuclear disarmament and 
provision of relevant assistance to it. The issue on Ukraine's 
accession to the Partnership for Peace was considered rather 
extensively. 
  During the course of the visit the delegation visited a 
number of important military facilities in the United States of 
America and took part in several military exercises. [sentence 
as heard] Agreements were reached between the military 
departments in numerous trends of military cooperation. In 
connection with this, a military contacts plan was specified and 
complemented. In particular, the sides agreed to establish a 
direct telephone communication line between the ministries of 
both countries, and to send a group of Ukrainian Armed Forces 
officers to undergo studies and training at the relevant 
educational centers in the United States. We also agreed on 
naval forces, on the land-based grouping, and also on the 
antiaircraft forces. We will send officers there for one month 
or three months long training. 
  We agreed on a regular exchange of materials and information 
on military issues, on the preparation and holding of joint 
military exercises in 1995, and on other issues. 
  The fact that already, as of 30 May, the United States of 
America retargeted its strategic missiles, earlier targeted at 
Ukraine, became an outstanding event for us. We have long been 
waiting for this, the more so since Ukrainian missiles underwent 
such a procedure in December 1993. Dr. William Perry had an 
opportunity to satisfy himself personally, during his latest 
visit to Ukraine in March this year, that the process of nuclear 
disarmament is going on consistently and irreversibly. 
  In its turn, at a missile site in South Dakota, our 
delegation members had an opportunity to see several silos, used 
for intercontinental missiles of the Minuteman-2 type, that were 
destroyed or prepared for destruction. 
  The fact that we had an opportunity to immediately 
participate in the destruction of one of such silos was an 
important event. Deputy to Mr. William Perry, Dr. Carter and 
myself pushed the launch button and the silo ceased to exist. 
  Very useful was our meeting with the leaders and leading 
specialists of the Rand Corporation, which is one of the most 
important research centers in the United States in the sphere of 
national security and defense issues. In my speech there I set 
out the main provisions of the national security doctrine of the 
Ukrainian state within the context of new possibilities for 
international cooperation. 
  Meetings with the Ukrainian community in Chicago made an 
unforgettable impression on all the members of our delegation, 
and me personally. I felt it my duty to deliver a speech there 
on the general situation in Ukraine, the general problems of 
building its Armed Forces, the development of military 
cooperation, and then answered questions. Our compatriots 
deserve high esteem. They gave us a very good reception. They 
were interested in knowing everything about the developments in 
Ukraine. As for nostalgia, it always remains a nostalgia. 
  Therefore, I believe that the visit was useful for both 
sides. We reached such a level of understanding with the U.S. 
side, which gives grounds to hope for a dynamic development of 
mutual relations between the military departments, and for good 
relations between our nations in general. 
  [Kukurichka] That was an official assessment of the visit by 
Ukraine's military delegation to the United States made by 
Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at a news 
conference in Kiev on 23 June. The report was filed by Vasyl 
Kukurichka, Radio Ukraine World Service.

  [Text] None of the candidates in yesterday's presidential 
elections received the necessary number of votes -- 50 percent 
of all votes cast -- to achieve an outright victory and become 
president of Belarus. However, two candidates -- who will 
continue their battle for the presidential post in a second 
round of voting -- have been specified. They are People's 
Deputy Alyaksandr Lukashenka, former chairman of the legislative 
anticorruption commission, and Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyachaslaw Kebich. Alyaksandr Lukashenka was the obvious leader 
in yesterday's presidential race -- he received some 2,659,409 
votes -- 45.1 percent. Vyachaslaw Kebich received 17.4 percent 
of the vote (1,025,732 votes). Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the 
opposition Belarusian Popular Front faction in the legislature, 
received 12.9 percent (757,586 votes), former Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Stanislaw Shushkevich -- 9.9 percent (584,604 votes), 
Alyaksandr Dubko, chairman of the Belarusian Union of Kolkhozes 
-- 6 percent (356,222 votes), and [Vasyl Novikaw], cochairman of 
the Communist Party of Belarus -- 4.6 percent. 
  BELAPAN draws attention to the fact that these are 
preliminary results, subject to change, however, not 
considerably. All in all, 5,870,055 voters participated in the 
elections. The total number of eligible voters in Belarus is 
7,457,939. At a briefing held this morning, Alyaksandr 
Abramovich, chairman of the Central Commission for Presidential 
Elections, predicts the need to hold a second round of voting. 
According to him, the final results of the 23 June vote will 
likely be announced on 30 June. The second round of 
presidential elections will be held no later than 14 days after 
the results of the first round are officially announced.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 21/6/1994 -- Last week a group 
of smugglers of radioactive substances was arrested in action, 
announced to BASAPRESS the chief of the Moldovan Ministry of 
Interior Department for Combating Organized Crime. The group 
had been monitored by the interior ministry bodies over four 
months. Moldovan citizens Ion Petcu, Alexandru Budoianu, and 
Simion Tarlev, in collaboration with a Russian citizen, were 
attempting to sell for $20,000 a tank with 1 kg of the 
radioactive substance called Gamma Cobalt-60 to a foreign 
merchant. According to the experts, this quantity would have 
been sufficient to pollute the entire territory of Moldova. 
Simion Lacramioara, the chief of the mentioned department, 
declared that recently Moldova has faced an increase in the 
smuggling of radioactive substances and drugs. In his opinion, 
this trend is caused by the lack of strict customs controls on 
the western borders to Romania and by the lack of borders 
themselves in the east, with Ukraine. According to Lacramioara, 
the radioactive substances are stolen from Russian military 
bases and then smuggled into Western Europe.

  [Text] A high-placed source in the Moscow Kremlin told 
Interfax President Yeltsin could call a nationwide referendum in 
the hope of having his term in office extended. Addressing 
Vladimir Shumeyko's suggestion for an extension, for another two 
years, of both the president's and parliament's mandates, the 
anonymous source said Yeltsin stood the best chance to win 
presidential elections in 1996 and would be unlikely to allow 
the State Duma and Federation Council decide how long he was to 
stay in office. 
  But, the source admitted that Shumeyko's initiative was 
logical and made sense. It would allow the mostly newcomer 
politicians to learn what was what and concentrate on law-making. 
  The source said Shumeyko's initiative was a touchstone and 
the Administration's response to it would depend on whether it 
was endorsed by the lawmakers, leading political parties and 
movements and other influential forces.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Elections" rubric: </F>
"Shumeyko's Idea May Belong to Burbulis. Discussion of Upper 
Chamber Speaker's Initiatives Continues"] 
  [Text] The country's news agencies are churning out 
reactions to the two most important current events: the soccer 
world cup and Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative on postponing the 
new elections for both Federal Council chambers. 
  Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov regards the 
proposal of the head of the upper chamber as dangerous because 
the unconstructive opposition may take advantage of the current 
debates to upset the hard-won stability. Mr. Filatov admitted a 
total lack of knowledge of Mr. Shumeyko's intentions. He added 
that having asked the latter why so sudden a proposal, he was 
told that the Federation Council chairman "wanted to see 
society's reaction." 
  Georgiy Satarov, a man who stands even closer to the 
president, described the initiative as logical because a 
postponement of the elections will permit the deputies to 
concentrate on making laws and have a favorable effect on 
society. 
  The best informed of all, which is as it should be, was the 
president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov. He pointed out 
that the idea had long been brewing and the first man to share 
it with him was not Vladimir Shumeyko or Mikhail Poltoranin but 
Gennadiy Burbulis. Thus, Mr. Shumeyko only had to "air" the 
eminent politician's plan. 
  Mr. Kostikov described the idea as "interesting, albeit not 
indisputable." The press secretary believed that the impending 
elections for the Federal Assembly threaten a sharpening of 
differences in society which plays into the hands of "impatient 
politicians." The press secretary's "interest" is also prompted 
by a possible linkage between the extension of the deputies' 
terms (naturally, for "preserving the political equilibrium") 
and a postponement of the presidential elections. 
  Mr. Kostikov made a guess about his boss' reaction to Mr. 
Shumeyko's initiative. The president, the press secretary 
believes, will refrain from public assessments in the near 
future because he values social accord. Mr. Kostikov suggested 
that the top speaker's initiative be submitted to expert 
assessment and discussion by political parties and movements, 
society, and the mass media. Only after the aggregate opinion 
is known would Boris Yeltsin voice his attitude because he is 
"the president of all people of Russia," far from political 
time-serving, Mr. Kostikov underscored. 
  Finally, as Mr. Satarov pointed out, Boris Yeltsin is 
prepared to back the idea of extending the deputies' powers on 
condition they demonstrate productive work. However, unlike 
what Mr. Kostikov proposed, he is categorically against moving 
back the presidential elections. 
  What is "the president of all people of Russia" going to say 
when political parties, movements, society, and the media come 
to him as the boyars did to Ivan IV petitioning him not to 
abdicate?

  [Text] Moscow, 22 June -- In an interview for the "Details" 
program on Russian television this evening Federation Council 
Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said that "he had spoken about" the 
question of extending the powers of deputies "a month and a half 
ago with both the president and with State Duma Chairman Ivan 
Rybkin." "We came to an understanding on this question, and in 
principal there were no objections either from the president or 
from the State Duma chairman," he said. 
  "Two years is a very short time for deputies to `get into' 
normal legislative work," was how Vladimir Shumeyko explained 
his position. 
  For his part, State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin in fact denied 
Vladimir Shumeyko's statement that the State Duma chairman had 
agreed with his proposal. In an interview with "Details" he 
said that the extension of the powers "should still be put to 
the people." "I think the Russian electorate thinks 
differently, and perhaps one ought to move toward re-election 
next year," he said. In his opinion, "considering the people's 
bitter experience, people of a quite different direction could 
be elected." 
  "It is possible to extend powers in a stable situation when 
the policy of those who carried it out has been fully 
justified," believes Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of Russia's 
communists. "In the present situation, when the policy has 
become completely bankrupt, when the socio-economic situation 
reminds one more and more of genocide and catastrophe, and when 
the spiritual disintegration of society has reached an 
unprecedented level, the question of changing course and 
changing those who are in charge has not only ripened but has 
overripened," he told a correspondent with the "Details" program.

  Karasin believes that the discussion and adoption of the 
agreement is the main goal of the Tehran talks and said that 
Russia hopes both Tajik delegations will reach an understanding 
on the issue. 
  He also said that Russia would continue to assist the

  [Excerpts] As was reported earlier, President Askar Akayev 
received Pakistan's Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Riaz Mohammad Khan 
on 21 June. [passage omitted] 
  The Pakistani ambassador presented his credentials to the 
president of Kyrgyzstan. 
  [Begin Akayev recording] Esteemed ambassador, I am pleased 
to 
receive your credentials on this important day and congratulate 
you sincerely on the occasion of your appointment as ambassador 
of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan. You 
represent the country with a centuries-old unique history and 
rich culture, which gained its independence in 1947 and achieved 
great success on this path. The founder of the state Mohammad 
Ali Jinnah [the first governor general of Pakistan] saw Pakistan 
as a democratic state and [word indistinct] where the ideas of 
humanity and equality have been embodied in the [word 
indistinct] state institutions. A great many of Pakistan's 
leaders dedicated their lives to that, among whom we can name 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and the current Prime Minister of Pakistan 
Benazir Bhutto, and of course the president of Pakistan. 
Today's event is an important stage for Kyrgyzstan and 
Pakistan. Pakistan is one of our closest neighbors and we 
cooperate within the framework of different international 
organizations, including the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation, the Islamic Conference Organization, and on a 
bilateral basis. Representatives from different ministries and 
departments of our countries have established their first but 
very promising contacts. The fact of Pakistan granting us a 
credit worth $10 million last year was an important stage in our 
relations. It was channelled for the development of health care 
of Kyrgyzstan. 
  Dear ambassador, by accrediting you as the first ambassador 
of Pakistan to Kyrgyzstan, we give a new impetus to 
Kyrgyzstan-Pakistan cooperation today, which I believe could 
become mutually beneficial and fruitful in future and serve the 
purpose of strengthening peace, stability and security in our 
region. To sum up, I would like to assure you, Mr. Mohammad 
Khan, that you can count on full support from me and the 
Government of Kyrgyzstan in fulfilling your historic mission. 
[end recording]

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has signed an 
agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the 
EU on the Greek island of Corfu. Our special correspondent Ilya 
Kapelevich reports: 
  The agreement defines the conditions and stages for the 
development of economic cooperation between Russia and greater 
Europe. Over a year and a half were needed to draw it up. The 
signing of the document was postponed twice. Now it looks as if 
partnership between Russia and the European Union is becoming a 
reality. What does it promise for our country? 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] We benefit from this agreement. We 
are entering free trade with Europe on equal terms without any 
of the discriminatory measures that existed in the past and 
which still exist in other countries outside Europe. Therefore, 
this is a wise and strong step by the European Community, all of 
its leaders and heads of states. I think that a historic step 
has been made today that will prevent an economic cold war. [end 
recording] 
  The treaty encompasses not only various aspects of relations 
at inter-state level, but also opens up new possibilities for 
ordinary citizens and enterprises. In accordance with the 
treaty, the European Union countries will remove all the 
discriminatory measures against Russian citizens seeking 
employment in Europe. The procedure for getting visas for those 
who obtained work illegally will be simplified. Europeans in 
Russia will enjoy the same rights. 
  Russian banks now have the full right to work in European 
countries, while the restrictions on the work of foreign banks 
in Russia will be preserved for the next two years. 
  The point of the treaty protecting the activities of 
European 
entrepreneurs in Russia against unforseeable changes in 
legislation, which happens quite often in our country, is 
extremely important for European entrepreneurs. The newly 
introduced restrictions will not affect them for three years 
from the time they are brought into force. 
  The agreement envisages the development of a political 
dialogue at all levels. This will enable the interested parties 
to maintain permanent contact and to consult on major problems 
regarding European security.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is convinced that 
signing of the agreements on partnership and cooperation between 
Russia and the European Union will help to remove numerous 
discriminations in trade relations with partners on this 
continent. Yeltsin voiced this statement on Thursday morning 
before his departure to the Greek island of Corfu where he is to 
sign this agreement with leaders of the European Union countries 
on June 24. 
  Responding to journalists, Yeltsin said that until now there 
have been discriminating measures in the relations between the 
Russian Federation and European Union "we had no quotas for 
goods export." According to Yeltsin, this draft agreement says 
that Russia is recognized as a country with an economy of a 
transition type. He also added that the draft agreement with 
the European partners establishes the most favored nation regime 
in trade. 
  Yeltsin is convinced that this is a very important fact, as 
well as the establishment of precise dimensions in the sphere of 
trade and export of goods from Russia. 
  "Russia will only win thanks to signing of this agreement. 
This is the first practical move when Russia enters Europe and 
becomes a European country of full value," Yeltsin emphasized. 
He made it clear that the draft agreement also determines 
concrete volumes of quotas, namely "how much uranium and 
aluminium we shall sell." "Earlier we were not allowed to Europe 
with these goods and now we have determined how much we can and 
must sell. This is very good," Yeltsin said. 
  Mentioning domestic problems, Yeltsin underlined that he 
does 
not intend to suspend his decree on measures to combat banditism 
and organized crime. 
  IF Note: On Wednesday the lower chamber of the Russian 
parliament recommended to the president to abstain from 
introduction of this decree as it assesses this decree as an 
anti-constitutional one. 
  In response to our Interfax special correspondent Boris 
Grishchenko on his arrival to Corfu, Boris Yeltsin declared that 
"blockade will be lifted from Russia" after the signing of these 
documents with the European Union. As he said, it is Europe 
"which will be the first to remove this blockade. However, the 
blockade on the part of the United States still remains." 
  The agreement which Yeltsin called "a historic document" 
will 
be signed on Friday afternoon. It consists of 81 pages. 
  In Yeltsin's words, it will help Russia to enter the 
European 
market and the Russian market will be open for Europe. "We 
become equal partners for the sake of mutual benefit," Yeltsin 
empathized.

  [Text] Athens, 25 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
left Athens today for Russia. On 24 June, on the Greek island 
of Corfu, he signed an agreement on partnership and cooperation 
between the Russian Federation and the European Union [EU]. 
Yeltsin was seen off at Athens Airport by Greek National 
Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, Russian Federation 
Ambassador to Athens Valeriy Nikolayenko, and other officials. 
The farewell ceremony was simplified as top Greek leaders are 
staying in Corfu, where the EU summit ended earlier today. 
  The Russian president travelled from Corfu to the port of 
Piraievs in the yacht Alexandros, which had served as his 
residence during the visit.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikolayev: "Route to Europe Lies Via the </F>
Island of Corfu: President Boris Yeltsin Signs Agreement with 
EU Today"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin arrived on the Greek island of Corfu 
yesterday. He will be taking part in the ceremonial signing of 
the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the European Union, which will be held here today. 
  Although there was no official announcement of President 
Boris Yeltsin's trip until the last few days, the world public 
had begun talking about it long ago. And preparation for the 
Russian guest's arrival was already in full swing on Corfu 
itself in the runup to the top-level EU Council session. Among 
other things, the Greek government asked the super-rich shipping 
magnate Yannis Latsis to put his luxurious yacht, the 
Alexandros, at our president's disposal during his stay. The 
yacht was recently used by former U.S. President George Bush 
when vacationing in Greece. 
  It is clear therefore why the special services team which 
has 
arrived from Moscow includes divers. Representatives of the 
special services of other countries are also here. Thousands of 
Greek policemen have been brought in to prevent any possibility 
of terrorism or sabotage. 
  However, all the manifold detail of the conference 
preparation, which is filling the press, does not prevent the 
public from seeing the main reason for the Russian president's 
trip to this distant island. He is to sign the Agreement on 
Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and 
the EU, to cover the next 10 years. Without going into the 
detail of the almost 100-page package of documents connected 
with the agreement, it is important to stress that they cover 
virtually all spheres of collaboration with the EU -- economic, 
political, and cultural. 
  These include the arrangements governing the trade in goods. 
This is perhaps the most "painful" issue. It has been resolved 
that the two parties will grant each other most-favored nation 
status. The EU does not henceforth regard the Russian 
Federation as a country with a planned economy but recognizes it 
as a transitional economy. The agreement envisages the 
development of cooperation in the basic sectors of the economy, 
the liberalization of the movement of capital and current 
payments, rules of competition, the harmonization of legislation 
in the economic sphere, and much else besides. 
  Generally speaking, the document to be signed by Boris 
Yeltsin lays down the principles for the free movement of goods, 
capital, and services between the parties, on which basis 
gradual integration of the economies of Russia and the EU will 
take place. This should provide a healthy economic basis which 
mutually opens markets and makes it possible to create 
conditions favorable to the activity of companies and firms and 
a climate conducive to investment. 
  We are thus talking about an all-embracing accord, a 
document 
which is not only extensive but very far-reaching. It will 
certainly considerably help Russia to assume the place 
appropriate to a great power in the world arena. 
  According to Boris Yeltsin, his visit will be exceptionally 
useful to the Russian economy. He has described the signing of 
the agreement as the first tactical move whereby our country 
"arrives in Europe." Henceforth, he said, discriminatory 
measures against Russia "whereby we have not been given quotas 
for the export of goods are overcome." It can be said right 
now, he stressed, that the new parameters of cooperation and 
partnership will make it possible to increase exports to 
European countries. The president added that the transitional 
nature of the Russian economy had still not been acknowledged in 
the United States. Barriers to Russian goods had not therefore 
been abolished there yet. 
  The EU Council will be examining a host of problems. After 
the signing of the agreement with Russia, for example, the 
ceremonial accession of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden to 
the Union will take place. And yesterday evening the EU 
countries' leaders organized a dinner with the Russian 
Federation president at which topical international problems 
were discussed. 
  The session will also sum up the results of the Greek 
representative's six-month chairmanship of the Union. His place 
will be taken by the representative of Germany.

<F P=106> [Report by Vissarion Sisnev: "Russia-United States: </F>
Package of Agreements. Russian Premier V. Chernomyrdin Answers 
TRUD Correspondent's Questions"] 
  [Excerpt] Washington, 24 Jun -- [passage omitted] Your 
correspondent asked V.S. Chernomyrdin to express his opinion. 
  [Sisnev] Forgive me, Viktor Stepanovich, but I want to 
repeat a question that I put to you after last year's Washington 
meeting. TRUD readers, being closer to the problems of everyday 
life than anyone in our society, will wish to know above all 
whether this visit will produce anything tangible for ordinary 
people. 
  [Chernomyrdin] There is no need to explain to me who TRUD 
readers are. But I can tell both them and the readers of all 
other newspapers that money has not been wasted on this trip, in 
the social sphere or elsewhere. What, essentially, are the 
space-related contracts that we will be bringing home? They 
mean support for our industry. For the defense and conversion 
sectors, which as a rule are in a very difficult position today. 
And Sakhalin-2? In the long term this is a multibillion 
contract which provides a solution to funding problems and will 
create a large number of new jobs. 
  I see major social benefits here. I should say that 
generally we do not consider, let alone sign any project unless 
there is a social program behind it. As for the agreements on 
ecology and conversion, will they not be of direct benefit to 
people? 
  [Sisnev] This is your commission's third session. A major 
milestone since, as the saying goes, good things come in threes. 
It is probably already possible to sum up some general results 
in terms of the effectiveness and the practical usefulness of 
this mechanism of bilateral partnership, is it not? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I believe that few bilateral organizations, 
particularly as young as ours -- it is not yet one year old -- 
can honestly claim to have produced such undoubted benefit, and 
practical benefit too. I can say without exaggeration or 
bragging that much has been done during this brief time. We, 
the Russian side, take a very responsible attitude to our 
obligations in the permanent commission, and it is fair to say 
the same of our U.S. colleagues. For his part Vice President 
Gore is trying very persistently to ensure that the mechanism we 
have created really works efficiently. The chief thing is that 
we do not shirk any issues, that we are expanding our activity 
and intend to expand it further. 
  [Sisnev] You talked for quite a long time with President 
Clinton. Were political aspects touched on during that 
conversation? Was an assessment made of the state of relations 
between the United States and Russia? As you well know, Viktor 
Stepanovich, there are "prophets" on both sides of the Atlantic 
ready at the drop of a hat to predict that these relations will 
develop into acute rivalry, if not worse -- in short, that they 
will inevitably collapse. 
  [Chernomyrdin] Of course political problems were discussed. 
As regards assessments, our bilateral relations were assessed 
only on a positive plane. They proceed in the ascendant from 
one presidential meeting to the next. With regard to the claim 
that relations could "collapse," that is simply stupid. Such a 
development is ruled out. Relations are improving and will 
continue to improve -- write that down. [Chernomyrdin ends] 
  Right after this brief interview the chairman of the Russian 
Federation Government left for Detroit, where his present visit 
to America will end in talks with the leadership of General 
Motors, the world's largest motor vehicle building company.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jun -- The main result of the trip to the 
United States by Viktor Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian 
Government, was the achievement of fundamental accords on the 
cancellation of the discriminatory Jackson-Vanik Amendment and 
the reforming of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls by Russia's participation. This was said today 
by Viktor Chernomyrdin at Vnukovo-2 airport on his return from 
the United States. 
  In all, the work of the Gore-Chernomyrdin intergovernmental 
commission resulted, the Russian prime minister said, in the 
signing of 22 documents on technical cooperation, including in 
the joint conquest of space. Russia signed space contracts 
worth in all 200 million dollars. In addition, four agreements 
were signed with the World Bank on the provision of credits 
totalling 500 million dollars for road construction and 
agricultural support. 
  In effect, Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed, it was a beginning 
of a breakthrough toward the practical side of Russia's 
cooperation with U.S. partners. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin pointed at a close link between the 
results of his visit to the United States and Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin's visit to the island of Corfu, where Russia had 
signed a document of cooperation with the European Community. 
"From talking about cooperation we have now come really close 
to specific actions," Viktor Chernomyrdin said. "During my 
meeting with Clinton we managed to consolidate the results 
achieved by the Gore- Chernomyrdin commission." In his view, 
all the conditions are now in place for the upcoming G-7 meeting 
in Naples, which is to be attended by President Boris Yeltsin, 
to end in a transformation of the G-7 into a G-8.

  [Text] On return from the United States on Saturday Russian 
Prime- Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told Interfax that in the 
States he had negotiated principled agreement on the elimination 
of the discriminatory restrictions on bilateral trade. 
  Chernomyrdin was confident that the Jackson-Vanik amendment 
would be declared null and void and that there was no chance for 
the emergence of a new COCOM [Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls] which jeopardized bilateral 
relations by introducing restrictions on high tech trade. But, 
Chernomyrdin said, the United States and Russia no longer showed 
critical difference of views. 
  Nonetheless, he said, the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission was 
planning to submit a few issues, for example, health care, to 
the attention of the Russian and US presidents. 
  Chernomyrdin said that 22 Russian-US agreements and 4 
agreements between Russia and the World Bank, including those on 
loans and to the agrarian sector and banking system, for the 
total worth of half a billion US dollars, were signed during his 
visit to the United States. Chernomyrdin said 
400-million-dollar deals were concluded for cooperation in outer 
space. And, he said, the two countries had come very close to 
the conclusion of another batch of space cooperation agreements, 
for the total worth of 300 Mn dlrs. 
  Chernomyrdin compared his visit to the United States and 
talks with President Clinton to Boris Yeltsin's visit to the 
island of Corfu where a partnership and cooperation agreement 
was signed between Russia and the European Union. In 
Chernomyrdin's view, the Russian-EU agreement would help Russia 
promote new relations with the European nations and belonged in 
the packet of documents he signed in the United States. 
  Both President Yeltsin and the Russian government envisaged 
the stage-by-stage incorporation of Russia into the European 
Union, Chernomyrdin said. This stage called for Yeltsin's 
participation in the political part of the G-7 summit, scheduled 
to be held in July in Naples. 
  Chernomyrdin made special mention of his talks with the 
General Motors Corporation which, he said, would like to 
cooperate with Russia and launch joint projects with the VAZ and 
ElAZ car plants. It was about time we stopped talking, 
Chernomyrdin said, and switched over to practical action. 
  Chernomyrdin hoped that Monday's session of the government's 
consultative investment council would enable Russia and its 
western partners to replace negotiations with practical action.

Weapons-Grade Plutonium Will Be Built on Russian Territory. 
Russian Premier's Visit to United States Has Been a Success -- 
They Lent Us Money"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, who is on an official visit to the United States, 
has held working meetings with Lewis Preston, president of the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRD], 
and IMF Director Michel Camdessus. 
  At the end of his meeting with L. Preston, the 
representatives of Russia and the IBRD signed four agreements 
granting the Russian Federation loans worth a total of $820 
million. We are talking about credit of $300 million to develop 
the country's transportation infrastructure, $200 million to 
develop the financial and banking system, $240 million to reform 
agriculture, and a loan of $80 million to implement land reform. 
  Replying to a question from an RIA correspondent, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin said that he had discussed with the IBRD directors 
not only current topics but also the prospects for the longer 
term. For example, an organization might be set up in Russia at 
the federal level which will concentrate all work with the bank 
in its hands. The premier also requested the bank's leadership 
to provide the Russian Federation with assistance in pursuing 
debts from countries which borrowed money from the former USSR. 
  Commenting on his meeting with V. Chernomyrdin, IMF Director 
Michel Camdessus said that at this meeting they merely discussed 
the general state of affairs in the Russian economy. "We did 
not mention any loans," he said. 
  M. Camdessus spoke highly of the measures being undertaken 
by 
the Russian Government in the economic sphere. "I am sure that 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet will be successful," he noted. It 
is expected that this summer representatives of Russia and the 
IMF will begin active work on an agreement for 1995. 
  Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
believes that the main result of the work done by the 
Russian-U.S. Commission headed by himself and U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore is that it has managed to convince the 
U.S. Administration of the need to regard Russia as a country 
with a transitional economy. Speaking about this in a talk with 
journalists, the premier also announced that U.S. leaders 
support the lifting of unjustified trade restrictions against 
Russia. "Our entrepreneurs should face no obstacles in their 
work on the world market," V. Chernomyrdin stressed. 
  He announced that the commission is broadening the scope of 
its activity. "We are complying with all the decisions we have 
made and on every occasion we are broadening the circle of 
problems under discussion," the premier said. 
  Russian Federation Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov, for 
example, told an RIA correspondent that at the next session of 
the commission a committee for scientific and technical 
cooperation in the sphere of transportation could be added to 
the committees for business cooperation, conversion, the power 
industry, science and technology, space, and environmental 
protection. 
  V. Chernomyrdin said that during the commission's work they 
had managed to reach agreement on U.S. participation in building 
storage facilities for weapons-grade plutonium on Russian 
territory; this plutonium will then be reprocessed into nuclear 
fuel. The United States has agreed to grant Russia compensation 
for the dual-purpose nuclear reactors which are being closed 
down and where weapons-grade plutonium is produced. 
  In an interview with an RIA correspondent, Russian 
Federation 
Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov explained that we are 
talking about two reactors located in the Tomsk and Krasnodar 
areas. In the opinion of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, closing 
them down will cost approximately $1.1 billion.

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- "We are against entering into 
polemic in public about vaguenesses which can naturally arise 
during the exchange of chemical arms data between Russia and the 
United States," a high-ranking spokesman for the Russian Foreign 
Ministry told ITAR-TASS on Friday in response to a request to 
comment on remarks by CIA Director James Woolsey, who told U.S. 
congressional hearings about the U.S. Administration's "serious 
concern" at Russia-provided data on her chemical weapons. 
  "We also have serious questions as regards data provided by 
the Americans. We hope to clear the matters up with the U.S. 
side during subsequent contacts," emphasised the spokesman who 
requested anonymity. 
  Russia and the United States have created a 
confidence-building mechanism as regards chemical arms on a 
bilateral basis. The mechanism is in operation and provides for 
exchanges of data on the military-chemical capabilities of the 
sides and for consultations should questions arise, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--"Russia does not develop and 
produce binary chemical weapons," Professor Viktor Petrunin, 
doctor of chemical sciences, said in an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS today. The scientist heads the State Scientific 
Research Institute of Chemical Technology. 
  According to Doctor Petrunin, the American side was fully 
acquainted with all works in this sphere even during the 
preparation of the treaty on a universal ban on chemical 
weapons. The over all volume of 40 thousand tonnes of poisonous 
compounds and their location on the country's territory is no 
more a secret for the world community. Foreign delegations and 
representatives of ecological organizations have been to all 
depots, he said. 
  The recently held international conference on chemical 
disarmament "Moscon-94" [as received] in Moscow, in the 
scientist's opinion, had additionally devised technology of 
destroying chemical weapons. Many foreign specialists have 
visited scientific research institutes and enterprises of the 
so-called military-chemical complex. Russian colleagues did not 
hide from them any secrets, assuming that chemical weapons are a 
historical anachronism. Many Russian scientists and 
manufacturers now are more interested in problems of conversion, 
including financing of the best projects and technologies to 
destroy and utilise poisonous compounds, the Russian scientist 
said. 
  According to Professor Petrunin, Pavel Syutkin, who has been 
appointed acting chairman of the conventional problems of 
chemical and biological weapons committee under the Russian 
president, will" continue openness of the disarmament 
programme". Russian scientists are prepared to show 
laboratories and industrial installations to U.S. specialists, 
as was done earlier. Russia has nothing to hide. It is 
sincerely fulfilling its all international obligations," Viktor 
Petrunin emphasised.

<F P=106> [Russian President's Directive No. 298-RP, dated 14 June </F>
1994, "On Control of the Export from the Russian Federation of 
Causative Agents of Disease (Pathogens) affecting Human Beings, 
Fauna, and Flora, Their Genetic Mutations, and Fragments of 
Genetic Material and Equipment Which May Be Used in the Creation 
of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons"; followed by 
interview with Pavel Syutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian 
President's Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention Problems 
Committee, by Lada Lyashenko under the "Commentary" rubric; 
place and date of interview not given] 
  [Text] 1. To approve the Russian Federation Government's 
list of causative agents of disease (pathogens) affecting human 
beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic mutations, and fragments 
of genetic material and equipment which can be used in the 
creation [sozdaniye] of bacteriological (biological) and toxin 
weapons whose export is controlled and carried out under license 
(see appendix). 
  2. The Russian Federation Government shall ratify the 
statute on the procedure for the control of the export from the 
Russian Federation of causative agents of disease (pathogens) 
affecting human beings, fauna, and flora, their genetic 
mutations, and fragments of genetic material and equipment which 
can be used in the creation of bacteriological (biological) and 
toxic weapons. 
  3. It is prescribed that the foreign economic activity 
commodity schedule codes indicated in the list appended to this 
directive may, if necessary, be clarified by the Russian State 
Customs Committee in conjunction with the Russian Eksportkontrol 
[Export Control Committee]. 
  4. The Russian Federation president's directive No. 711-RP, 
dated 17 November 1992, is deemed to have lapsed. 
  5. This directive comes into force from the moment of its 
signing. 
  [signed] B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation 
  [dated] 14 June 1994 
  Note. The list is not published. 
<H5>  "We Are Conducting an Open Dialogue" </H5>
  Pavel Syutkin, deputy chairman of the Russian President's 
Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention Problems Committee, 
now comments on this document. 
  [Syutkin] The Russian President's directive is a kind of 
stage in the development of our country because this is surely 
the first time that we have stated clearly and accurately that 
Russia shares the principles and approaches to the problem of 
bacteriological and toxin weapons adopted in the civilized 
world. We have embarked on the path of cooperation and have 
tacitly begun to cast off the rigid straitjacket which held us 
tight for many years. 
  [Lyashenko] The international convention "On the Prohibition 
of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of 
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their 
Destruction" was signed back in 1972. Is Russia today honoring 
the commitments made by the USSR when it signed this document? 
  [Syutkin] The president has signed an edict confirming the 
Russian Federation's succession in law with regard to the 
Convention's obligations. This means that the development and 
implementation of biological programs in breach of the 
convention are prohibited on Russian territory. Control is 
entrusted to our committee. However, whereas this convention 
contains detailed measures on the banning and control of 
chemical weapons, the same cannot be said about bacteriological 
weapons. There are certain complications here. For example, 
the basic "raw material" -- the human and fauna pathogens, 
fragments of genetic material, and various types of equipment 
and apparatus -- are dual-purpose. The pathogens are essential 
for research purposes and apparatus is needed for vaccines, but 
those same instruments can be used to produce bacteriological 
weapons. Precise criteria are needed governing prohibition and 
control. Work to elaborate such an approach is under way but 
that will take many months, if not years. There have been many 
international conferences since the convention was signed. 
There was a conference of countries parties to the convention 
in Geneva in September (?1991) [final digit indistinct], where 
Russia openly stated its position for the first time. 
  [Lyashenko] The list of pathogens and equipment whose 
export is controlled and carried out under license contains more 
than 100 named items. However, many of them are not typical of 
Russia and are hardly ever encountered here, for example, "Rift 
Valley fever pathogens" and "banana top bushiness pathogens" 
[vozbuditel kustistosti verkhushki bananov]. Why have they been 
included in the list? 
  [Syutkin] This list was drawn up in accordance with the 
recommendations of the so-called "Australian group." It was 
created in 1985 and included the 25 most advanced countries. 
These countries guarantee the implementation of a unified 
control of the export of materials and equipment which can be 
used to create bacteriological weapons. Furthermore, all 25 
countries are interlinked by a kind of reciprocal pledge: If 
one of them refuses the export of any materials or equipment to 
anyone, the others are obliged to follow that example. This 
reciprocal provision of information, support, understanding, and 
openness help prevent the proliferation of bacteriological 
weapons. In June 1993, in accordance with the requirements of 
the international regime controlling the nonproliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, the "Australian group" extended and 
clarified the list of materials and equipment whose export is 
controlled and carried out under license.

<F P=106> [Report by Yusuf Shakir: "Russian Ambassador to Cairo: We </F>
Have Stopped Arms Shipments to Yemen; Our Recognition of South 
Depends on Brahimi's Report"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- Russian Ambassador to Cairo Vladimir 
Polyakov has denied that Russia has provided any military aid to 
the parties to the Yemeni conflict. 
  He revealed that Moscow has stopped sending arms shipments 
to 
the two warring parties. He stressed that his country's 
recognition or nonrecognition of the South Yemen state will be 
determined in the light of the report UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi 
is to submit to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali. 
  The Russian ambassador said following his meeting yesterday 
with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid that 
he had informed the League that Moscow has instructed him to 
coordinate positions with the Arab League vis-a-vis the Yemeni 
crisis and to closely monitor what is happening in Yemen. He 
pointed out that Russia supports an immediate cease-fire and the 
initiation of a direct dialogue among the conflicting parties. 
He added that this is in line with the Arab League's position. 
He revealed that the stage ahead will witness a Russian move on 
the current situation in Yemen through the results Brahimi is 
going to reveal in his report on the crisis. However, he did 
not specify the nature of the move.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others] 
  [Text] China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is due to come 
to Moscow on Monday [27 June] evening. On Tuesday he is 
scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
It is not ruled out that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will 
meet with the Chinese minister as well, Russia's Deputy Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov reported in his interview with Interfax 
Friday. 
  As he said, the parties will continue preparation for an 
official visit of Chairman of the People's Republic of China 
Jiang Zemin scheduled for September. "In addition, it is 
necessary to coordinate our positions on several sharpest 
international problems, in particular, to discuss preparation 
for the first ASEAN forum on security which is to be held late 
July and which head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrey 
Kozyrev is to attend and the situation on the Korean 
peninsular," Panov said. 
  He recognized that there are differences in Moscow's an 
Beijing's approaches towards the Korean problem. "The Chinese 
count on bilateral contacts. In their opinion, it is more 
expedient to go "along three roads with four partners" where 
"three roads" mean bilateral negotiations between North Korea - 
the United States, North Korea - South Korea, North Korea - 
IAEA. However, the Chinese do not rule out that it will be 
necessary to hold an international conference at a certain 
stage. As far as Russia is concerned, we are not against 
bilateral relations, however, everyday practice demonstrates 
that it brings no results. Then why should we become hostages 
of this form of relations? That's why we persistently call to 
convene an international conference," Panov said. 
  He does not rule out that in the course of Qian Qichen's 
visit the parties will touch upon the problem of demarcation of 
the Russian-Chinese border. He recognized that until now part 
of the population in the regions bordering China did not 
understand principles of demarcation. "They even appealed to 
denounce the 1991 Russian-Chinese agreement which was ratified 
by the Russian parliament. This is clearly an unrealistic 
approach," Panov continued. 
  He reported that he had recently visited Khabarovsk and met 
with its residents. In addition, Genrikh Kireyev, head of the 
Russian delegation at the negotiations on border issues, made a 
televised address. "We have presented necessary explanations. 
As a result, those who wanted to understand the situation 
perceive it as sober- minded people. But it is difficult to 
persuade those who want to build local policy on this," Panov 
said. 
  He reconfirmed that in accordance with the 1991 
Russian-Chinese agreement the border will be laid along the 
fairway of the navigable rivers and in the middle of 
non-navigable ones. "The thing is that there has been neither 
any border laid here nor any demarcation. The principle "who is 
strong he considers that this is his territory" reigns here. 
Now we start to draw a civilized border, for the first time in 
the history of the Russian-Chinese relations. - Panov continued. 
- Naturally, we are to go away from some territories which were 
occupied by us in the thirties without any notifications and 
agreements. On the other hand, we shall receive a legal right 
for other territories." 
  Panov specially stressed that there is no question about 
"any 
dramatic concessions." "If there are any concessions, these are 
concessions to the international law and sound sense," he said. 
  Mentioning the fate of the islands of Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy 
and 
Tarabarov which are situated near Khabarovsk, Panov pointed out 
that they "remain in our possession. There are no doubts about 
this," he noted. 
  When asked whether the parties would discusses 
trade-economic 
cooperation and, in particular, military shipments to China, 
Panov answered that "they do not stand on the agenda." "These 
issues were in detail discussed during the recent visit of 
Premier Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Beijing," he explained.

  [Text] St. Petersburg, 24 Jun -- A delegation of 
parliamentarians of the North Atlantic Assembly has arrived in 
the city on the Neva. Today they visited the Taurida Palace -- 
the headquarters of the Inter-Parliamentary Assembly [IPA] of 
the CIS countries. 
  The representatives of the inter-parliamentary organization 
of the 16 NATO member-states were interested in the economic 
situation in the Commonwealth countries and, first and foremost 
in the parliamentary capital of the CIS. During a conversation 
with Mikhail Krotov, the general secretary of the IPA, issues 
related to the conversion of defense enterprises both in St. 
Petersburg and in the CIS as a whole, and problems of attracting 
foreign investments to the former Soviet republics were touched 
upon. In this connection, Krotov stressed the IPA's special 
role in creating the legal basis for the market economy on the 
territory of all the Commonwealth countries and in developing 
international business contacts. 
  The sides expressed mutual interest in strengthening further 
ties between two of the world's major parliamentary structures.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun -- "The developing format of a 
political G8, which includes Russia, must ensure that more 
constructive solutions are reached to pressing international 
problems, solutions based on mutual respect for the interests of 
leading states and their responsibility for international 
security and stability," says a statement which was distributed 
today by the Committee on International Affairs of the Russian 
Federation Council. The statement was issued in connection with 
the summit of G7 countries which will be held in Naples on 9-10 
July. The summit will be attended by Russian Federation 
president Boris Yeltsin. 
  The results of the economic section of the forthcoming 
summit 
meeting will depend in many respects on whether there is a 
readiness to set about real implementation of agreements reached 
at previous summits on support for reform in Russia, a readiness 
to take practical steps to intensify and develop them. The 
statement stresses that "without Russia's participation it is 
difficult to see how many global economic problems, including 
the problem of foreign debt, can be effectively resolved. It 
has to be recognized that Russia is not just a debtor but also a 
creditor. Russia, which has inherited the huge debts owed to 
the former USSR by developing countries, is entitled to 
participate in the evolution of approaches to this problem by 
other creditors of third world countries."

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The day, 25 June, is the 44th anniversary of the 
beginning of the Korean war. Station commentator (Mikhail 
Gretov) writes as follows: 
  The most tragic day in Korea's national history is 25 June. 
The Korean war broke out 44 years ago on this day. The South 
and North were dragged into a severe war. This war, which 
continued for three years, took over 10 million lives. Millions 
of people were handicapped and cities and villages were 
destroyed. The economies of the South and North were paralyzed. 
  Throughout the world there are continuous disputes over who 
started the war. Probing into the cause of the war is necessary 
so that such a tragedy will not be repeated. We must not forget 
the fact, however, that the armed conflict between the South and 
North was the first example of confrontation of the cold war 
era. Using the name of the United Nations, the United States 
supported the Seoul side. On the other hand, the Chinese 
Volunteers supported the Pyongyang side and appeared at the 
battle yard. Also, the old Soviet Union armed the DPRK in all 
means. Thus, this war grew into the greatest international 
conflict. 
  The bloodshed war ended with the signing of the Armistice 
Agreement, but there is still no peace on the Korean land today 
after 40 years. The divided two states of the unitary nation 
continue artificial confrontation. 
  The Korean nation has been appealing for the country's 
reunification for the past 40 years, but it seems that 
reunification will not be achieved easily. This is because the 
political and economic systems of South and North Korea are too 
different. Elements of outside forces that instigated 
confrontation between Seoul and Pyongyang are gradually 
disappearing. 
  For example, these days the North Korean leadership 
proclaimed that it is willing to freeze its nuclear program and 
come forth to the third round of talks with Washington. A 
sincere and equal principle must be found in the talks to 
completely resolve the nuclear issue and improve mutual 
relations between the United States and the DPRK. 
  Preparatory work for the first South-North summit talks is 
being carried out actively. Extensive issues must be discussed 
at the summit that are directly related to the fate of the 
Korean nation. Such a summit will ultimately provide a favorable 
basis to make the situation on the Korean peninsula sound. 
Also, it will support resolving the task of achieving Korea's 
reunification.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Asia" program] </F>
  [Text] The DPRK declared that it is willing to freeze its 
nuclear program [haek kangnyong] and has informed the United 
States. U.S. President Bill Clinton said during North 
Korean-U.S. talks, Pyongyang will not conduct refueling 
operations at its reactor in Yongbyon or reprocess [kagong] 
waste fuel accumulated at the reactor. 
  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts stationed 
in North Korea will remain at its nuclear facilities [haek 
taesang]. Responding to Pyongyang's freezing of its nuclear 
program, Washington said that it will resume high-level talks 
with the DPRK. The United States will not bring up the issue of 
economic sanctions against the DPRK at the UN Security Council. 
  The acute situation over the DPRK nuclear program has 
remarkably been eased. The situation was extremely aggravated 
by Pyongyang's refusal of a complete inspection of its nuclear 
facilities [haek taesange taehan sacharul wanjon surakhaji 
anatkko] and its declaration on withdrawing from the IAEA. 
  Recent changes in the situation do not mean that a way to 
the 
complete solution of the North Korean nuclear problem has been 
found, but necessary conditions for a solution to the problem 
have been prepared. 
  The international community wants to assure that weapons of 
mass destruction are not being produced on the Korean peninsula. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said: If Pyongyang's 
attempt to possess nuclear weapons is ignored, other countries 
will try to possess nuclear weapons, following Pyongyang as a 
model case. Its neighboring countries, such as the ROK and 
Japan, will actively be engaged in developing nuclear weapons. 
  Therefore, Russia cannot help but carefully watch the 
nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. The situation in Northeast Asia 
will be normalized only when Pyongyang's nuclear program is 
clarified. Anyhow, Pyongyang's statement on freezing its nuclear 
program will make South-North dialogue possible. A South-North 
meeting is already under discussion. The easing of tensions 
will make it possible to hold an international conference on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 26 TASS -- A series of meetings of 
representatives of the Russian Government, led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and heads of 14 major 
transnational corporations opens in the President Hotel today. 
It is expected that in the course of a three-day direct 
dialogue a permanent consultative council on foreign investments 
under the Russian Cabinet of Ministers will be created. It will 
be headed by Chernomyrdin. The council is expected to meet no 
less than twice a year. 
  "The main purpose of the economic council, which is being 
created for the first time, is to hear attentively the 
potential investors," Chernomyrdin said in an ITAR-TASS 
interview on the eve of the meeting. "We would like to know what 
ways western business people suggest for increasing investments 
in Russia, what is hampering their work and how the Russian 
Government could help remove the unnecessary barriers on their 
way, including in the sphere of taxation." 
  Chernomyrdin expressed hope that they would manage to pass 
over from words to action at the first Moscow meeting in 
promoting investments in the Russian economy. The firms we 
invited to take part in the meeting are not at all newcomers on 
the Russian market, he stressed. 
  These include the well-known companies Coca Cola, Procter 
and 
Gamble, BASF, Mars, Ernest and Young, United Technologies, 
Citycorp etc. Informal meetings of government officials and 
business people will be held today, and the main work will start 
on Monday.

<F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report under the "Investment" rubric: "Oleg </F>
Soskovets Trying To Lure Foreign Investors"] 
  [Text] At a meeting of the World Economic Forum, which 
ended its work in Moscow yesterday, First Deputy Prime Minister 
Oleg Soskovets called for foreign investors to step up their 
operations in Russia. According to government estimates, 
currently there are 1,316 -- mostly small -- joint ventures 
operating in Russia. The aggregate foreign share in them is 
estimated at $181 million. 
  The first deputy prime minister's statement was designed to 
attract as many foreign investors as possible to the Russian 
economy. In his words, Western investors will soon have an 
easier time doing business in Russia. This will be helped by 
the passing of the law "On Concession Agreements, Agreements on 
Providing Services, and Production-Sharing Agreements with 
Foreign Investors" and also by amending the law "On Foreign 
Investment in the RSFSR." According to Mr. Soskovets, these 
draft documents will shortly be considered by the Government 
Presidium. Overseas investors' operations will also by 
facilitated by presidential edicts that will form a third 
package. 
  In addition, the first deputy prime minister thought it 
"advisable to reduce the number of taxes, to cut the value-added 
tax and profit tax rates for enterprises producing goods and 
services" at the expense of raising taxes levied on mediatory 
organizations. Presently a government commission is being set up 
to improve tax legislation, which will be made up of 
representatives of federal authorities, economic institutes, and 
"prominent economic managers." 
  Oleg Soskovets expects to receive long-term loans for social 
projects from the World Bank. In his words, "Western assistance 
is necessary if reform is to succeed in a swifter and less 
painful fashion."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS -- A decision, announced by 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday, to resign 
together with the entire cabinet "will not affect the 
development of Russo-Japanese relations", a high-ranking staff 
member of the Russian Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, 
told ITAR-TASS on Saturday. 
  The current developments in the Japanese political life are 
an internal affair of Japan and the choice of its people, the 
diplomat said. 
  As far as Moscow's approach to relations with Japan is 
concerned, the strategic policy line, determined on the strength 
of the results of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Tokyo in October last year, towards large-scale development of 
bilateral relations and intensification of the political 
dialogue remains unchanged, he said. 
  The level of mutual understanding reached between the two 
sides during the Russian leader's visit rendered the relations 
between the two countries civilised, taking them out of the 
category of sensations which were unnecessary at times, the 
Russian Foreign Ministry staff member said. "We are prepared to 
continue to maintain such a level of mutual understanding in 
future as well," he added. 
  Upon mentioning that he has available so far only 
preliminary 
and conflicting information on the latest developments in 
Japan's political life, the Russian diplomat did not rule out 
the possibility that Mr Hata will retain the premiership in a 
new government which the country, judging from everything, will 
get next week.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Sobolev: "Russian Peacekeeping Forces </F>
Move Into Zone of Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict"] 
  [Text] And so, the political debates are behind us, and 
tomorrow, 26 June, as announced by Russian Federation Deputy 
Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev, the operation to maintain 
peace in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict will begin. A 
sketch map [karta-skhema], published today, has been provided 
for by the agreement on a cease-fire and the disengagement of 
forces. The security zone must be devoid of heavy combat 
hardware -- artillery weapons and mortars of a caliber exceeding 
80 mm, as well as tanks and APC's. This hardware will be 
withdrawn into "collection areas" which are under the control of 
UN military observers. It is also planned to pull Georgian 
troops out of the Kodori Gorge and back across Abkhazia's 
borders, as well as to disband and withdraw from Abkhazia armed 
detachments which arrived there from beyond its borders. 
  Aleksandr Arinakhin, chief of the Russian Federation 
Ministry 
of Defense Sector [napravleniye] for the Leadership of 
Peacekeeping Forces, explains: 
  "I have just returned from Abkhazia, where, by decision of 
the Federation Council, the Russian forces' peacemaking 
operation is getting under way. Right now, our subunits are 
being moved out there. We are expecting other Commonwealth 
countries to participate in this operation. I think it will be 
a success: Third time lucky, as they say, and this is the third 
time we will be separating the warring sides.... So the third 
attempt should be successful. A dispute is now going on over 
why Russia does not have an international mandate for the right 
to conduct such operations. But it had no such mandate before, 
during the previous operations, and it would seem that, owing to 
the indecision of the United Nations, we will not get one in the 
near future either. Although nor do we see evidence of any 
ardent wish on the part of the international organizations to 
quell the conflicts on the territory of the former Union.... 
Which is why we have to act on the basis of our laws and 
international treaties. Let me remind you: Both Abkhazia and 
Georgia requested Russia to carry out the peacemaking operation. 
I will add that the experience of past years has shown that 
Russian peacemaking forces operating in conflict zones do not 
under any circumstances use weapons against peaceful 
inhabitants. So it is that our soldiers understand the 
complexity and the specifics of the forthcoming operation, and 
they are prepared for it."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 23 Jun -- Russia has officially 
informed the UN Security Council that CIS collective 
peacekeeping forces are being deployed in Abkhazia for a period 
of six months in order to prevent fresh bloodshed in the 
conflict zone. This is stated in a letter from Russian 
Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was distributed here 
today as a Security Council document. 
  "The situation in Abkhazia and in the Republic of Georgia 
remains very tense and there is a continuing threat of fresh 
bloodshed. The fact that there are still over 250,000 refugees 
and displaced persons there means that no eventuality can be 
ruled out. This includes the possibility that elements which 
are not under the control of either side could destabilize the 
situation," A. Kozyrev noted. 
  The minister pointed out that although the international 
community realizes that a peace-keeping operation in the Abkhaz 
region "is indispensable," it has been reluctant to adopt a 
decision on forming a UN force for peacekeeping in Abkhazia, on 
the grounds that "conditions are not ripe" yet. "However, as far 
as the peacekeeping operation is concerned, the time factor has 
now become critical if peace is to be secured and the necessary 
conditions created for further progress toward a political 
settlement," A. Kozyrev stressed. 
  He recalled that in the agreement on a cease-fire and 
disengagement of forces, which was signed in Moscow on 14 May, 
the Georgian and Abkhaz sides appealed to the Council of CIS 
Heads of State to adopt a decision on the use of collective 
peacekeeping forces in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. 
Furthermore, the parties sent a special appeal to President 
Boris Yeltsin of Russia, who is chairman of the Council. 
  "Acting on the basis of Chapter XIII of the UN Charter, the 
commonwealth decided to send collective forces to the conflict 
zone for a period of six months. An advance party, consisting 
of Russian forces already stationed in Abkhazia, is being 
deployed right away," the document says. 
  It points out: "The commonwealth is not seeking to take the 
place of UN efforts, but to help create the best possible 
conditions for them to work. Therefore, it is important to 
establish, right from the outset, close cooperation between the 
peace-keeping forces and the UN observer mission in Georgia. We 
hope the Security Council will decide to increase the strength 
of this mission and to expand and clarify its mandate." 
  Russia expressed hope that the establishment under UN 
auspices of a special voluntary fund to finance peacekeeping 
operations in Abkhazia "will help to attract a wide range of 
states to peacekeeping work."

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Sergey Lavrov will evidently replace Yuliy Vorontsov as Russian 
U.N. chief delegate if the latter is approved as ambassador to 
the United States. 
  A high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry who 
refused to be identified, told ITAR-TASS on Friday that "the 
Vorontsov-Lavrov link continues to operate". Lavrov is now in 
New York. Talks that Lavrov may replace Vorontsov at his post, 
started last year for the first time. 
  Lavrov's possible appointment will complete a series of 
planned reshuffling among Russian leading ambassadors. Russian 
First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin will evidently 
replace Boris Pankin in London while Vorontsov will most likely 
go to Washington to occupy the post held by Vladimir Lukin, the 
present chairman of lower house Committee on International 
Affairs.

  [Text] The future of the Black Sea Fleet [BSF] is under 
control by the Russian president, government, defence ministry 
and the Russian Navy's chief command and will be resolved on the 
basis of bilateral agreements signed with Ukraine. This follows 
a cable from Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Navy Admiral 
Felix Gromov to BSF Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin. 
  Baltin is asked to let the BSF officers and men know that no 
statements from some Ukrainian military officials will be able 
to hinder a solution to the problem in exactly that way. 
  In a speech in Sevastopol on Tuesday, Commander of the 
Ukrainian Navy Vice Admiral Vladimir Beskorovainy said that 
Sevastopol was a Ukrainian naval stronghold while the Russian 
Navy could be deployed there as one of a foreign state under a 
leasing agreement spread over a period of 15 to 25 years. 
  For its part, the press service of the Russian Navy in a 
statement on Thursday said that "in the emerging situation, such 
statements by the chief of the Ukrainian navy department are 
aimed at unsettling the situation over the BSF". These address 
those forces in Ukraine which assume extremely nationalist 
positions in resolving a highly complicated problem in relations 
between two fraternal Slav nations, says the statement.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- The Federation Council on 
Friday issued an address to the parliaments of the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) member-states in 
connection with the passage of a citizenship law by the Latvian 
Sejm. 
  The Sejm passed the law "in defiance of numerous protests by 
the international public and without reckoning with the 
recommendations of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and a number 
of international experts", the address pointed out. Thereby, 
the Latvian authorities "ignored the universally recognised 
standards in the field of human rights," the Council stated. 
  The Russian parliamentarians, the address said, cannot 
remain 
indifferent to the position of the members of national 
minorities restricted in their right to receive Latvian 
citizenship. In this connection they believe that Latvia's 
further destiny, the ensurance of its genuine, not imaginary, 
national security and the possibility of the creation of a 
democratic law-governed state will in many respects depend on 
the world community's and, first of all, CSCE states' and 
parliaments' stand on the issue, the address pointed out. 
  The Federation Council called on them "to uphold the 
principles of humanism that are being asserted in Europe and to 
prevent Latvia from slipping down to an aggressive nationalism 
and the emergence of a seat of tension in the Baltic region".

  [Text] The leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy intends to demand that the Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev resign for signing the Partnership for 
Peace accord. He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax 
on Thursday that "Kozyrev had no right to sign this program 
since the Duma spoke unequivocally against it." 
  Kozyrev signed the paper at NATO's Headquarters in Brussels, 
thereby making Russia a party to the NATO initiative. 
  Zhirinovskiy threatened to abrogate the treaty since it was 
not legally binding. The signature of one person "when 
parliament spoke against is meaningless", he maintained. 
  He also argued that "no state will take the document 
seriously since the legislature objects to it." Without 
agreement with it, any signing is absurd, Zhirinovskiy declared. 
  He also announced that the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
faction has a nominee to the foreign minister's office.

<F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "United States Spares No </F>
Expense on Spying"] 
  [Text] Washington is spending the truly astronomical sum 
of $28 billion in the current fiscal year on the needs of the 
intelligence agencies in spite of the fact that, as the 
Americans themselves testify, with the collapse of the Soviet 
Union "the majority of objectives and missions which the 
intelligence agencies had to perform during the Cold War have 
disappeared." 
  The so-called "intelligence community" of the United States 
is reminiscent of a gigantic octopus. It comprises agencies 
like the CIA with a budget of $3 billion, the National 
Reconnaissance Office [natsionalnoye razvedyvatelnoye 
upravleniye] which is responsible for satellite intelligence and 
receives $7 billion annually, the National Security Agency which 
gathers information by electronic means and spends $4 billion, 
the Pentagon's Operational Agency for Tactical Intelligence 
[operatsionnoye upravleniye takticheskoy razvedki] with a budget 
of $12 billion, and the Department of Defense Defense 
Intelligence Agency whose annual expenditure comes to $600 
million. 
  Today, even in Washington people are beginning to realize 
that such expenditure on spying activities cannot be justified. 
The U.S. National Security Council has set about studying how 
best to define the intelligence community's role in the present 
circumstances. THE WASHINGTON POST wrote that the main purpose 
of their ongoing investigation is "first to identify the threats 
which the United States will encounter in the next 10-20 years, 
and second to determine the manpower and resources available to 
neutralize them." 
  The study of U.S. intelligence activities is still far from 
being completed. But it is already clear that the individual 
changes which have recently been implemented in the major U.S. 
intelligence agencies are cosmetic in nature and do not provide 
for fundamental change. Their previous structure remains 
unchanged, though the problems they solve and the volume of 
their work have changed significantly. Even certain former 
high-ranking CIA staffers now openly admit that it is essential 
to fundamentally reform the intelligence agencies and to limit 
their role. 
  Each state, of course, strives to possess the fullest 
possible information about what is happening in the world, what 
threats they might expect, and from where these threats might 
come. Such information is gathered in various ways, including 
intelligence sources. But it is one thing when some country 
comes up against major potential dangers, as was the case during 
the period of global confrontation along an East-West axis. It 
is a completely different matter when it is only a question of 
conflicts at a regional level, like, for example, those the 
United States has come up against in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia. 
  Thus, you get the impression that the wind of change blowing 
across the world has not affected the U.S. intelligence 
community. It continues to act in accordance with past 
standards. Naturally, the billions of dollars are not being 
spent on spying against the Cocos Islands or Transkei. But the 
question naturally arises: Against whom then?

<F P=106> [Special correspondent Nikolay Litkovets report under the </F>
"Events and Commentary" column: "Sea and Land Exercise for 
Peaceful Purposes"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok -- Your special correspondent has 
participated in an exercise aboard an American amphibious 
warfare ship. 
  The sides had agreed a year ago that such a Russian-American 
exercise would take place in two stages. The next meeting of 
sailors and assault forces of the Russian and U.S. Navies will 
take place in 1995 on American soil. But this year this most 
peaceful of military exercises ended on the Pacific Fleet 
marines' training ground. It began with an exchange of 
amphibious craft. 
  ...On the morning of 20 June the amphibious transport dock 
Dubuque, stationed in the roads of Ussuri Gulf, disgorged 
several amphibious craft, which headed for a large Pacific Fleet 
amphibious warfare ship. While, from the shore, a column of 12 
armored personnel carriers belonging to the Pacific Fleet 
Marines battled their way to the Dubuque against force three to 
four winds. Your correspondent also boarded the American ship 
from a light amphibious vehicle, so he understood full well the 
feelings experienced by the assault troops. But that was only 
the first part of what was essentially a rescue operation 
mounted by the Russians and Americans. 
  The next day two echelons of amphibious vehicles set out to 
cross the two kilometers to the shore of the Klerk peninsula. 
There, on the training ground, the aftermath of an earthquake 
had been simulated, with fires, real damage, and "casualties," 
who were played by a couple of dozen Russian sailors. Although 
they had set their subordinates a tough task, the leaders of the 
exercise, Rear Admiral Nikolay Kochergin, commander of a 
combined unit of Pacific Fleet marine landing forces, and Rear 
Admiral John Sigler, commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet amphibious 
forces, were forced to note their high level of naval combat 
proficiency and professional qualities. In the admirals' 
opinion, the exercise demonstrated that providing assistance in 
a disaster zone either on its maritime flanks or on islands was 
a task within the marine assault forces' ability.

  [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS -- "Russia's geopolitical 
position, the ineffective legislation and customs and border 
control contribute to the increase in drug trafficking and 
strengthening of ties with international drug business," Russian 
Interior Ministry top officials said on Saturday. 
  They stressed that in the Moscow, St. Petersburg, 
Kaliningrad, Omsk and other Russian regions the share of 
illegally imported drugs has exceeded 80 per cent lately. As a 
result of one of the operations last year law enforcement bodies 
seized 42,000 ampoules of the drug buprenorphin shipped to St. 
Petersburg from India. 
  Other drugs include pure heroin, Colombian cocaine and 
crack. 
  Russian law enforcement bodies have set up special units to 
fight illegal drug business. The Interior Ministry alone keeps 
over 3,000 specialists. 
  In 1993 law enforcement bodies handled 53,000 drug-related 
cases (16,000 in 1990), over 8,000 drug dealers were exposed 
(threefold increase since 1992 and sevenfold since 1989). A 
total of 4,500 gangs involved in drug trafficking were arrested, 
over 40 tonnes of drugs confiscated. 
  Two new draft laws have been worked out -- on fighting 
illegal drug trafficking and on control of drug trafficking. 
The government plans to allocate 18 billion roubles in 1994 to 
finance the implementation of the anti-drug programme. 
  On October 22, 1992 in Kiev 13 republics of the former 
Soviet 
Union signed an agreement on cooperation in fighting illegal 
drug trafficking. Since then Russia has signed similar 
agreements with 30 countries and maintains close contacts with 
Interpol and U.N. agencies.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun (TASS) -- Cuba could become the 
strategic base launching Russian high technology onto Latin 
American markets. This was Deputy Prime Minister Oleg 
Soskovets's proposal to Cuban Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Soto 
[title as received], with whom he had a working meeting today. 
  Oleg Soskovets said Russia was interested in selling a large 
batch of military helicopters to Colombia to fight the drug 
mafia. In a deal like this Russia could offer Colombia very 
competitive conditions. As is known, Colombia today is facing a 
need for this type of aviation technology. Cuba for its part 
has very close links with Latin American countries and also 
knows the situation on the local market and could offer 
considerable support to Russian firms trying to export their 
products to Latin America. Russians have so far had to try to 
operate on their own on the Latin American continent and often 
suffered losses as a result, Soskovets said. 
  The interstate company RosCuba, set up recently, is playing 
an important role in promoting cooperation between Cuba and 
Russia in bringing Russian goods and technology into Latin 
America, Oleg Soskovets and his colleague Lionel Soto believe.

  [Text] Members of the Russian Federation Council decided to 
appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to examine the 
anti-crime decree issued by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  A total of 64 deputies (36 percent of the total number) 
voted 
for this decision. In accordance with provision 125 of the 
Constitution, at least one fifth of the Federation Council 
deputies must back an appeal to the Constitutional Court. 
  The appeal was initiated by deputies Aleksandr Belyayev, 
Yuriy Boldyrev and Aleksey Manannikov. 
  Belyayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that the 
Constitutional Court could consider the appeal this autumn after 
the State Duma adopted the law on Constitutional Court at second 
reading.

  [Text] The Federation Council approved Friday changes and 
amendments of the Russian Criminal and Criminal Proceedings 
Codes. 
  Nearly 40 articles of the former and nine of the latter were 
amended. At the same time 19 Criminal Code articles were 
annulled and 15 new ones included. 
  The Council's Constitutional Legislation and Legality 
Committee issued a statement saying that among important new 
articles were 17 on crimes committed by a conspiring group of 
people or by an organized group and 213 (3) on terrorism that 
were aimed at combatting organized crime. Article 13 on 
necessary defense was revised. The notions of socialist and 
personal properties were removed. 
  The committee said that some changes and amendments of the 
Criminal Code were fundamental in that they had a bearing on the 
main institutions of criminal law and would enhance the 
suppression of crime. 
  Also Friday the Federation Council passed without debate a 
bill adopted by the State Duma on foreign borrowings and credits 
granted by the Russian Federations.

  [Text] Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko 
says he voted in favor of the government-proposed budget for 
1994. Speaking in Moscow, he said his decision came after the 
Council had pushed through new articles to the budget relating 
to government spending on the armed forces. 
  Article 32 now provides for an extra budgetary fund of 
support to the army to be raised as part of government revenues 
from privatization. The resources are to be channelled to 
provide social security nets to the servicemen including housing 
construction and conversion of defense-related industries. 
  One other article binds the government to bring down the 
cost 
of this year's defense spending by offering contracts to men and 
non-commissioned officers and hiring officers in reserve, 
reducing the number of military schools and disbanding 
understaffed contingents. 
  The budget now provides for 40.6 trillion rubles of defense 
spending in 1994. 
  However, the Council did not adopt any resolution on 
Shumeyko's report about FC's role and place in overcoming 
critical trends in the country. The question will be discussed 
as the Council meets again next month.

  [Text] Members of the leading Russia's Choice (RC) 
parliamentary faction have thrown weight behind the government- 
proposed budget after rejecting it in the three previous rounds 
of voting. RC leader Yegor Gaydar said his faction was led by 
two main reasons in reversing its decision. On the one hand, 
any attempt to try to improve the budget by the present 
parliament would be hopeless. On the other, the RC did not want 
any political gambling by the Liberal Democrats over the budget. 
  Gaydar described the proposed budget as totally unrealistic 
with its revenue and expenditure parts being far too high. In 
his view, the paper reflects the existing balance of forces in 
the State Duma following last December's election and a strong 
pressure by sectorial lobby groups in parliament. 
  The RC leader said both administration and government 
representatives had appealed to his faction during a break in 
vote-taking and the RC "accepted their considerations, 
particularly those relating to LDP demands in exchange for their 
support". Gaydar denied having engaged in any horse trading on 
the issue.

  [Text] Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said today it 
was premature to discuss the possibility early elections. 
Commenting on the proposal to extend the powers of the 
parliament and the president for a second term Rybkin said that 
first people should feel the economy is being stabilized and 
life improved as a result of actions taken by the Federal 
Assembly (parliament - IF) and the government. The proposal to 
extend the president's and parliament's powers was put forward 
by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  Before leaving for Siberia and the Far East Rybkin answered 
questions during a press conference by phone organized by the 
Russian State Duma's press service and Interfax. 
  Rybkin said that the legislative process must be seen to be 
working. 
  He said if the work was properly carried out and the 
legislative bodies of at least two thirds of the federation's 
constituent members spoke for this, the chamber could discuss 
the postponement of elections. However, he added that it was 
unreasonable to speak on the postponement of elections in 
advance. 
  Rybkin stressed that during his trips across Russian regions 
voters kept saying they were tired of elections. 
  Commenting on the recommendation of the State Duma to 
suspend 
the president's anti-crime decree, Rybkin said the president had 
been asked not to enact the decree until a resolution on its 
implementation is adopted. Rybkin stressed that the decree was 
not simple and that its basic idea -- the fight against crime -- 
could not be rejected. 
  Rybkin said he was sure that the decree would soon become 
law. He repeated that the State Duma had decided to set up a 
working group in order to draft the appropriate law with the 
participation of representatives of the president, the 
government, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office. 
  When asked his opinion on proposals to declare direct 
presidential rule in the country, Rybkin said he doubted that 
Boris Yeltsin would introduce it and that the whole concept was 
inadmissible in a country trying to establish the rule of law.

  [Text] The State Duma group of Yegor Gaydar's Russia's 
Choice rejected proposals that the term of the Federal Assembly 
be extended. It insisted on holding parliamentary and 
presidential elections as specified by the constitution. 
  In its statement made public in the Duma Friday the group 
said that its members could not agree with the proposal made by 
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  The statement said that Russia's Choice was giving priority 
to legality and morality over political expediency. It cast 
doubt on the desirability of what Shumeyko had proposed. The 
Russia's Choice group considers that instead of consolidating 
political stability it would destroy the weak saplings of civic 
accord, trust between political groupings and respect for the 
law that had emerged in Russian society recently. 
  The group is not convinced by Shumeyko's argument that the 
extension of the terms would save much funds. It states that 
society had paid dearly for every short cut of democratic 
procedures. What is more, it would be members of parliament who 
would make a decision on extending their own terms, which would 
place them in a delicate moral position.

  [Text] On Friday Russia's State Duma adopted a decree "On 
the Constitutional Court." As many as 331 deputies voted for 
this decree, five -- against, and 27 abstained from voting (as 
it is known, the RF Constitutional Court and members of the 
State Duma Committee on Legislation and Legal Reform submitted 
this bill for consideration). The procedure of filling 
Constitutional Court (CC) vacancies remains unchanged -- a CC 
judge is appointed by the Federation Council following the 
president's nomination. 
  Given its authorities the CC hears trials on correspondence 
with federal laws, normative acts of the Russian president and 
of both chambers of the Federal Assembly, of Russian government, 
Constitutions of the republics, charters and laws of the RF 
constituent members to the RF Constitution. The court can also 
determine the congruence with the Constitution and treaties made 
between state bodies of power of the Russian Federation and 
state bodies of power of the RF constituent members, and 
agreements between state bodies of the RF constituent members. 
  It is within the Court's competence to determine the 
congruence with the Constitution of the international agreements 
of the Russian Federation which are not in force yet, to 
interpret the RF Constitution, to make conclusions about the 
observance of the procedure of accusations against the Russian 
president of high treason or of committing any serious crime. 
The CC has the right to initiate legislative actions on issue 
which are in its competence. 
  Any citizens of the Russian Federation who is over 40, has 
an 
excellent reputation and higher juridical education and 
experience of juridical work of no less than 15 years can be 
appointed to the post of a judge on the CC. 
  The decree stipulates that powers of a CC judge can be 
suspended if the CC agrees to arrest him or to bring charges 
against him or if he is unable to fulfill his duties due to the 
state of his health. 
  The mandate of a judge in the CC can be taken away if the 
rules on his appointment were violated. 
  The same measure is taken if a judge looses citizenship of 
the Russian Federation or if he is sentenced or if the judge 
continues to behave incompatible with his post despite warnings 
on the part of the RF Constitutional Court. 
  The decree foresees that the chairman of the CC is elected 
at 
its plenary sitting by a secret voting by the majority of 
judges. Chairman of the Court, his deputy, and judge-secretary 
are elected for three years.

<F P=106> [Boris Boyko report: "LDPR Tries To Straighten Things Out </F>
With the Privatizers"] 
  [Text] After adopting the budget, the State Duma at its 
session yesterday undertook an energetic, although abortive, 
attempt to suspend post-voucher privatization. A response from 
the government -- a final approval of a corresponding program -- 
is to come today. 
  It seems that when he first addressed the State Duma, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in response to appeals by Anatoliy 
Chubays to observe the time limit, let drop the phrase: "Mr. 
Chubays, you will be watching the clock in Lefortovo! [prison]" 
Yesterday's session confirmed the seriousness of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's intentions. 
  The LDPR faction submitted to the Duma a bill with a 
"telltale" name: "On Suspending the Process of Privatization in 
Russia as of 1 July 1994 Pending Examination of the Results of 
Voucher Privatization and Approval by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly of a Concept and a State Program for 
Post-Voucher Privatization." The Duma Council at its session 
did not approve this move. The Council decided to find a 
compromise and confine itself to an appeal to the president and 
the prime minister. The draft appeal, submitted by 
Privatization Committee Chairman Sergey Burkov, is effectively a 
warning. It says that owing to lack of guarantees of ownership 
rights for owners of former state property, the Duma will be 
forced to suspend the law On Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises. Responsibility for this lies "with those 
state officials who have failed to create a legal foundation for 
this process." The appeal was not supported by the deputies. 
  Then Zhirinovskiy, stating that "behind each instance of 
privatization there is a crime," demanded that the bill drafted 
by his faction be passed immediately. It was supported by 194 
deputies (226 votes were needed to pass it). As a result, "the 
matter will be finalized" in the privatization and economic 
policy committees. 
  It's now the government's turn. Sings are that the 
post-voucher privatization program will be considered today. It 
remains unclear, however, whether this program will be presented 
to the Federal Assembly. On the one hand, until now Anatoliy 
Chubays has insisted that the post-voucher program be enacted by 
a presidential edict. His position is understandable: First, 
there is little time, to put it mildly, for normal consideration 
in parliament, and second, the Duma's intentions to punish 
embezzlers and corrupt officials speak for themselves. On the 
other hand, the State Duma's warning is serious enough. 
Moreover, there is nothing to prevent the LDPR from regularly 
moving its bill, which will hang like a sword of Damocles over 
the government. In these conditions the likelihood of the 
post-voucher privatization program's being presented to the 
Federal Assembly increases. If this happens, Chubays will 
apparently have nothing left to do but follow the fate of the 
voucher and resign. While he found it possible to avoid this 
move when the president ordered him to leave Moscow 
privatization to Luzhkov, discussion in the Duma will have more 
far-reaching consequences.

law raising minimum wages by 40 percent. The law has already 
been adopted by the State Duma. ITAR-TASS says minimum wages 
will be 20,500 rubles from 1 July. The deputies gave the

  [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun -- The State Duma has decided to meet 
in plenary session three times a week during the time remaining 
to the parliamentary recess. Until now it has been holding two 
plenary sessions a week -- on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
  Communist Deputy Igor Bratishchev, who put forward the 
proposal for an additional sitting, noted the Duma had a lot of 
work to complete before deputies went off on their holidays. He 
observed that many deputies were neglecting their duties by not 
attending the Duma regularly. As an example, he cited his 
political opponents in the Russia's Choice group. He claimed 
that "30 percent of Yegor Gaydar's supporters do not turn up for 
plenary sessions."

  [Text] Ingushetia has worked out a real plan to bring the 
refugees back home in line with President Yeltsin's decree 
concerning four communities in North Ossetia's Prigorodniy 
region. As Interfax correspondents report, the plan was 
announced by Ingushetia's President Ruslan Aushev at a meeting 
in the administrative center of Nazran Friday [24 June] night. 
  He revealed that the first to return to the Dachnoye, 
Dongaron, Kurat, and Chermen communities at the initial stage 
1-5 July would be the families whose homes are safe. Expected 
back within five days from July 5 to 10 will be the refugees 
living in temporary dwellings. After that, the rest will return. 
  Aushev also reported that subsequently more villages would 
be 
set aside on agreement with the Ossetian authorities for those 
Ingush families that had resided there before the conflict. 
According to the federal migration service, there are 49,000 
Ingush refugees from North Ossetia on the territory of 
Ingushetia now. 
  However, Aushev stressed that the plan could be translated 
into action only if the Ossetian side signed a protocol to this 
effect. 
  North Ossetia's President Akhsarbeck Galazov and his 
Ingushetia counterpart Aushev are scheduled to meet on Saturday 
with Dagestan officials and the interim governor Vladimir 
Lozovoy to act as mediators. Representing the Federation 
Council will be Ramazan Abdulatipov, its vice-chairman.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>
  [Text] Vladikavkaz June 26 TASS -- A meeting between North 
Ossetian and Ingush Presidents Akhsarbek Galazov and Ruslan 
Aushev, respectively, is taking place at the Vladikavkaz airport 
on Sunday with mediation from head of the temporary 
administration Vladimir Lozovoy. 
  The meeting is also attended by members of the two cabinets 
and legislators of the two republics which are members of the 
Russian Federation. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from sources close to the North Ossetian 
president that the sides are discussing a procedure for 
returning and settling refugees and displaced persons at places 
where they predominantly lived in the villages of Chermen, 
Dongaron, Dachnoye and Kurtat in the Prigorodnyy district, North 
Ossetia. The sides are to sign a document called upon to settle 
the problem. 
  The document says that, in compliance with the decrees of 
the 
president of the Russian Federation and the Kislovodsk 
agreement, the North Ossetian Government and the Ingush 
Government will create, with direct participation of the 
temporary administration, conditions for a comprehensive 
solution of the problem of refugees and displaced persons, in 
line with the principles of mutual respect, racial peace and 
accord, territorial integrity of the republics and observance of 
law. 
  The leaderships of the North Ossetian Republic and of the 
Ingush Republic as well as the temporary administration proceed 
from the premise that both residents in the four villages and 
returning residents will take obligations to abide by the laws 
of the Russian Federation and the North Ossetian Republic, to 
refrain from kindling ethnic stife, to recognise the territorial 
integrity of the North Ossetian republic in the existing 
administrative territorial borders and to fulfill decisions of 
legal bodies of power and administration. 
  The meeting is also attended by Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy 
speaker of the Russian Parliament upper chamber, and members of 
the legislators' group of the upper chamber.

  [Text] There is every indication that a protocol on 
refugees return to North Ossetia's Prigorodniy region will not 
be signed on Saturday, the Federation Council's Vice Chairman 
Ramazan Abdulatipov, who is currently in the zone of conflict, 
has said in an interview with Interfax. 
  "We should not rush with signing this document since we need 
a coordinated protocol that would be implemented in full," he 
stressed. 
  It is for precisely for this reason, he stressed, that a 
meeting between him and North Ossetian leaders would be 
expedient. 
  "Only after all points of the protocol were agreed, a 
meeting 
between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia would 
make sense. We do not need one more unfeasible document," he 
remarked. 
  "It will take decades to stabilize the situation after that 
horrible tragedy, and Ingushetia's president has chosen a 
correct course toward bringing the refugees back stage by 
stage," Abdulatipov said.

  [Text] The administration of the Chechen president 
[Dzhokhar Dudayev] is now sorting out the security services. 
  [Ramzan Khadzhiyev] The forces of law and order in the 
Chechen republic are not having the best of times. After 
another presidential purge, many heads of the power structures 
have lost their jobs, including the procurator general, the 
heads of certain power departments and heads of militia area 
divisions. Dudayev is not attacking the Internal Affairs 
Ministry and procuracy so much for the assassination attempt on 
him, as for the paralysis in the power forces when faced with 
criminal groups. 
  [Begin Dudayev recording] The heads of all power forces are 
to carry out a thorough investigation into officials in the 
bodies of law and order and security who are directly 
responsible for ensuring the safety of top officials, law and 
order, and observance of legislative discipline. The toughest 
measures are to be taken against them, up to and including 
instigating criminal charges. [end recording] 
  [Khadzhiyev] The decree has been published, and the passions 
around it have still not died down. Those fired are looking for 
high-ranking intermediaries in order to return to their 
comfortable offices. Criminal elements are on their guard and 
biding their time.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, June 26 (TASS) -- A State 
Duma delegation, led by its speaker Ivan Rybkin, which is 
continuing its working trip to Siberia and the Far East, arrived 
in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky late on Saturday. 
  In Kamchatka the legislators will meet representatives of 
the 
local government bodies, naval officers and sailors, fishermen 
and workers of fish-processing enterprises. Rybkin will visit 
the famous Geyser valley and Paramushir, one of the Kurile 
islands. 
  Previously the delegation visited Irkutsk, where they took 
part in the work of the Siberian agreement council. It includes 
19 republics, autonomous and national districts, territories and 
regions of Siberia. During the work of the Siberian agreement 
council Rybkin and heads of the main State Duma committees told 
in detail representatives of the executive and legislative 
authorities of Siberian regions about the law-making work of 
the lower chamber of the federal assembly and its prospects. 
  Rybkin told journalists at the airport that the legislators 
"wished to see for themselves the life in those cities, which 
are so far away but are still our, Russian cities, to talk with 
people, to hear the opinion of heads of local administrations. 
We want advice on the best way to divide the pie which is 
called the budget."

  [Text] The Federation Council's Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko 
called for carrying out a policy of state protectionism toward 
Siberia. With this aim in view, he initiated a bill on top 
priority measures to develop Siberia. 
  Speaking at the session of the Interregional Siberia 
Agreement Association at Irkutsk Saturday, Shumeyko explained 
that for a period of one year Siberia should be guaranteed 
against a number of the newly legislated economic measures. For 
this reason, he spoke in favour of changing transport and 
electricity tariffs. 
  In his opinion, such a bill should be passed by the assembly 
houses before they get down to examining the draft of a federal 
budget for 1995, which the cabinet has been instructed to submit 
by September 15. 
  The Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, also attending the session, 
backed up Shumeyko's proposal. In an interview with 
journalists, he called for reasonable protectionism toward 
producers and for giving regions more powers in drafting 
taxation policy. He stressed that local authorities should 
display more lawmaking initiative in federal parliament. 
  Deputy Premier Sergey Shakhray has also necessitated a 
temporary law on commodities shipment to Arctic regions to stay 
in effect in 1994-1995. He underlined that in the federal 
budget, endorsed by the parliament's houses on Friday, the 
delivery of goods to Arctic areas is estimated at 5.5 trillion 
rubles.

  [Text] Khabarovsk June 25 TASS -- A number of 
socio-political movements in Amur area, in a message to the 
president, the Federal Assembly and Government of the Russian 
Federation, have expressed strong disagreement with the methods 
suggested by President Boris Yeltsin to combat crime. 
  They pointed out that the recently signed presidential 
decree 
runs counter not only to the norms of criminal procedure 
legislation but also to major provisions of Russia's 
Constitution. 
  The message is signed by representatives of the Khabarovsk 
regional branch of the Economic Freedom Party, the territorial 
organisation of the Peasant Party, and the "Land and People" 
social foundation. 
  The signatories believe that the presidential decree will 
not 
protect the population against organised crime but would bring 
society back to the times of universal angst, people's 
suspiciousness with regard to one another, and would lead to 
violations of human rights and unfounded repressions.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The poach-control operation 
"Putina-94" inflicted a blow on criminal gangs in Russia's 
south, militia Colonel Aleksandr Skurtul, deputy chief of the 
poach-control operation headquarters, said in an interview with 
ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
  Militia officers seized 149 firearms (including 
submachine-guns) from law-breakers, several thousand rounds of 
ammunition, 45 explosives and considerable quantities of 
grenades. 
  Militia officers exposed over 20 previously committed crimes 
and detained 248 criminals who were on the wanted list. In 
Skurtula's opinion, criminal families in the Caspian region now 
make attempts to restore their operations after suffering 
considerable damage (authorities instituted 305 criminal cases). 
For instance, a carrier of caviar was recently detained on the 
Astrakhan-St. Petersburg train with 487 cans of caviar. 
  According to Skurtula, the poach-control operation is 
expanding. Interior Ministry forces are now joining fight to 
preserve national wealth in the Far Eastern region. Experience 
gained in the Caspian region will help to carry out succesfully 
operational measures. 
  "The underworld quickly responds to our actions. Therefore, 
the struggle will be difficult and long," Skurtul said in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Luchegorsk (Maritime Territory), 27 Jun -- The 
northern regions of the Maritime Territory have turned out to be 
on the verge of economic catastrophe. A strike by transport 
workers of the Luchegorsk opencast coal mine, which is the main 
supplier of fuel for the Primorskaya state regional electric 
power station, the giant of far eastern power engineering, has 
been going on for ten days now. The shortfall in deliveries of 
coal over the ten days exceeds 500,000 tonnes. 
  The main reason for the protest action was that the 
transport 
workers' wages are regularly overdue and they have not been paid 
since April. Besides this, the strikers are demanding the 
abolition of tariff cuts, as well as the resignation of the 
director of the main enterprise of "Primorskugol". 
  In their turn, the administration of the transport 
directorate, believing the action to be illegal, have instituted 
court proceedings against the strikers. In response, according 
to a report from Mikhail Byankin, chairman of the strike 
committee, their families will picket the court sitting.

  [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS -- The Russian Government has 
instructed the Ministry of Fuel and Power, together with the 
government of the Republic of Komi, to work out by the beginning 
of 1995 a comprehensive programme to restructure coal-industry 
enterprises in the Pechora coal fields, according to a 
government resolution made available to ITAR-TASS on Saturday. 
  The programme is expected to suggest solutions to such 
matters as reconstruction, a rise in the efficiency of promising 
coal mines, the construction of new ones, the employment of 
mineworkers thus released, a gradual relocation of the disabled 
residents of Vorkuta and Inta to other regions of Russia, etc. 
  At the same time the ministry is to substantiate the 
expediency of the continued operation of four coal mines -- 
Yun-Yaga, Promyshelennaya, Yur-Shor, and Yuzhnaya by October 
this year. 
  The government resolution provides for a number of other 
measures as well.

TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk 24 June TASS -- "What has happened came as a 
sensation only for those who refused to face the truth," said 
Belarusian presidential candidate and presidential race leader 
Aleksandr Lukashenko commenting on his success in the first 
round of the elections. 
  "The poor and deprived people for the first time had a 
chance 
to elect their like to the supreme state post, and the people 
said its word," Lukashenko told BELINFORM over the telephone 
today. 
  Speaking of his further plans against corruption, Lukashenko 
said "all the high-ranking officials accused by the 
parliamentary commission against corruption remain on their 
posts. They are ready to do everything to finish the 
construction of their villas." 
  As for his election program, the presidential candidate 
noted 
they have "outlined three areas: To keep in check the inflation 
and price increase, work against corruption and establish close 
economic relations with Russia." 
  Lukashenko's team has elaborated "a block of proposals to 
solve the economic problems, stop the production recession 
within six months, resume the work of enterprises, bring people 
back to their jobs and create more jobs." He said they hope to 
do it with the assistance of Russia.

<F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F>
on 24 June; place not given -- recorded, in Russian] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots! 
  I thank you for the courage and civicmindedness that you 
displayed in the first round of presidential elections, having 
given me over 45 percent of your votes. Notwithstanding 
systematic provocations and a stiff embargo on information, my 
team and I have felt your constant support. After 23 June, the 
distribution of forces in the political arena has fundamentally 
changed, since you not simply voted for the first president, but 
actually passed a vote of no confidence in the policy of the 
current Belarusian Government and local bureaucratic 
authorities. It is a turning point in the development of our 
society on the path toward democracy. I am sure that we will 
complete our task. There are only a few days left, and you will 
acquire the power which you want, in which you have believed, 
and which will not cheat you. I believe that the second round 
of voting will confirm your will. 
  I appeal to all who voted for other candidates in the first 
round to determine -- with whom do you stand? Are you defending 
the old corrupt authority, which has lost touch with the people, 
or are you supporting a resolute renovation of our state? I 
appeal to you to go jointly on the path of honesty for the good 
of every one of you, my dear compatriots. I am sure that 
together we can preserve the peace and civic accord during these 
difficult times, and these will become a guarantee of Belarus' 
future flourishing.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential candidate Alyaksandr Lukashenka </F>
by Nikolay Nazarovich on 25 June; place not given: "I Am 
Grateful to the Voters"] 
  [Text] [Nazarovich] Alyaksandr Hryhoravich, how would you 
explain such a tremendous, sensational lead over your rivals? 
  [Lukashenka] What took place was a sensation only for those 
who did not want to see the truth. For our team, however, this 
was a disappointment, because we had counted on more votes and a 
victory already in the first round. I believe that this is not 
a sensation for the people either. The impoverished, destitute 
people for the first time had an opportunity to elect a man from 
their circles. So the people expressed their views. I would 
like to show my gratitude to everyone who voted in my support. 
This is first. Second, I believe that all the best, the most 
suitable Supreme Soviet deputies found themselves in my ranks. 
  [Nazarovich] How are you going to work on the second round 
of the presidential election -- to unmask corrupted officials or 
to present a creative program? 
  [Lukashenka] I was simply responding to all those assaults 
and mud that was thrown at me. Regarding the unmasking, I will 
again repeat: Those who are involved in corruption must not 
remain in power. After all, all who were debunked by our 
commission have not repented. They are ready to give up 
everything, in order to complete construction of their houses. 
Yet, can one do that at the current wages? This means that the 
people are again being plundered. 
  Regarding the second part of your question, during these two 
weeks we will pay special attention to explaining the creative 
potential of our program. We have set up three primary 
directions -- curbing inflation and price hikes, fighting 
corruption, and establishing close ties between Belarus and 
Russia. We have currently prepared a package of issues 
concerning resolutions to economic problems, in order to stop 
decline in production as early as in six months, to put 
enterprises into operation, to return fired people to their old 
work places, and to create new work places. We want to do that 
with the help of Russia, which, I hope, will meet us half-way. 
  I will not retreat from the electoral battle, and I will not 
withdraw my candidacy, even under the most extreme threats 
against me.

  [Text] In an interview with ZVYAZDA on 25 June, Uladzimir 
Zamyatalin, secretary to Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw 
Kebich, commented on the results of the first round of 
presidential elections. In particular, he said: "The prime 
minister realizes that there have been no elections since 1990. 
He understands the primary motives which guided people during 
the presidential elections. The point is that the people voted 
not against Kebich but against the current developments in the 
Republic." Uladzimir Zamyatalin voiced doubts over fears that 
when Lukashenka comes to power he will begin with repressions. 
  The press secretary refuted rumors that the Kebich team will 
attempt to disrupt the second round of elections. He stated 
that Kebich and his team have not yet discussed his withdrawal 
from the elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman </F>
Myacheslaw Hryb by Maria Graczyk in Minsk; date not given: 
"Love Dictated by Common Sense"] 
  [Text] [Graczyk] Was the proclamation of independence in 
1991 a mistake? 
  [Hryb] It is certainly difficult for us to maintain the 
sovereignty that we achieved then, especially from an economic 
point of view. However, which of our neighbors finds things 
easy? Even though all changes call for some effort, we are not 
going to give up our independence. 
  [Graczyk] However, there remain increasingly fewer 
attributes of it. 
  [Hryb] So far we have not lost anything -- we have our own 
territory, borders, and Constitution. The official language is 
Belarusian. In fact, we also have our own economy -- a meager 
and limping economy, but it is still our own, independent 
economy. We have already adopted a packet of sovereign legal 
provisions and international agreements, concerning, for 
example, human rights. Belarus is the first country in the world 
which had strategic nuclear weapons on its territory and 
abandoned them voluntarily. Does this not prove the sovereignty 
of our Republic? 
  [Graczyk] What about the presence of Russian troops? 
  [Hryb] It is an historical necessity; it is our historical 
legacy that we cannot evade. We cannot demand that our neighbor 
all of a sudden withdraw all of its troops. To where should it 
withdraw them? We have signed a bilateral agreement in which we 
consider this state of affairs to be only temporary. Actually, 
apart from the Baltic states, no one treats this issue that 
rigorously. We must understand Russia, which is not to blame 
for this situation. The CIS is, in a way, like a family which 
exists only thanks to the art of compromise. This also holds 
true for relations with our eastern neighbor. 
  [Graczyk] What are these concessions all about? 
  [Hryb] We agree to the dates for withdrawing troops which 
have been proposed by the Russians and we provide assistance in 
transit; the Russians sell us energy resources at lower prices. 
We are all but forced to use that source. Perhaps other 
sources will emerge in the future; however, for the time being 
we must live and cooperate somehow. We are realists. 
  [Graczyk] Is this desire to be embraced by Russia dictated 
by common sense? This is at least how the agreement on merging 
the Belarusian and Russian monetary systems is interpreted. 
  [Hryb] Signing this agreement does not at all mean a 
combination of the monetary systems. This would be possible 
only after the Supreme Council ratifies the agreement or after 
appropriate amendments to the Constitution are made. For the 
time being, nine articles of this agreement have come into 
force; they concern, among other things, taxes and tariffs. 
Personally I am an advocate of integration; however, the 
integration should not be achieved with such great steps. 
  [Graczyk] What will be the next step? The military and 
financial steps have already been taken. 
  [Hryb] The agreement on collective security, which was 
signed in Tashkent, is not a military alliance. It merely 
envisions cooperation between members states of the CIS in the 
area of armament; our Army will not survive without it. Since 
the arms industry of the post-Soviet states is strongly 
decentralized, we are practically required to cooperate with 
each other. For the time being, there is also no uniform ruble 
zone. Both in Belarus and in Russia many milieus are against 
this concept. However, I must concede that it would be much 
easier for us if we bought energy sources for instance, for the 
same prices as the Russians buy them. Right now they sell oil 
for $80 per ton, whereas they offer the same amount of oil to 
their own enterprises at $40. It is obvious that this affects 
the cost of production. Aside from that, it is first of all 
Russia that constitutes the market for our goods. We will not 
sell them in Poland or in the West. 
  [Graczyk] The Baltic states, which until recently were also 
strongly tied to Russia, are facing similar problems. Even 
though they achieve various results, they are still trying to 
reform their economies. 
  [Hryb] I do not agree with the statement that we were in a 
similar situation as the Baltic states. First of all, Soviet 
authority came to Belarus in 1917, not in 1939. This is a quite 
important difference. Second, our economy was more dependent on 
Russia and other Soviet republics. Third, after the war we did 
not have reserves of gold or hard-currency deposits abroad. 
Regretfully, it must also be noted that Western states have all 
along treated the Baltic states differently than they have 
treated us. 
  [Graczyk] Why has Belarus not even tried to embark on a 
reform program? Why has it chosen to return to Russia instead? 
  [Hryb] It is not true that we are giving up on reforms. We 
merely believe that haste is inadvisable in this case and that 
it can be very dangerous. We do not have any guarantee that if 
we implement reforms and destroy some branches of the economy, 
such as agriculture, for instance, we will find someone who will 
feed us on the following day. The attempts to privatize 
agriculture have failed in Lithuania and the land is now fallow. 
We believe that people who live in the countryside should 
themselves choose a method of working: they can be farmers, 
lease holders, or they can remain collective farmers. Before we 
destroy anything, we should build something new, and only then 
should we decide what is to be done with the old structures. 
  [Graczyk] However, the privatization of agriculture is very 
slow and land has been leased to only 3,000 people. 
  [Hryb] No one can be made to do anything by force. Whenever 
I visit collective or state farms, I ask people if any of them 
want to lease land from the state. No one ever does. Why? 
First, it is a new phenomenon; second, it is difficult; third, 
it yields profit only after some time. The lease holder can 
then only count on himself because the state, unfortunately, 
provides him with too little assistance. Now, on a collective 
farm he is guaranteed low but still sure wages and assistance 
from his fellow workers. 
  [Graczyk] Many investors, including foreigners, would be 
interested in private activity. However, they are discouraged 
by the fact that no reforms are being implemented. So far less 
than $550 million has been invested in Belarus. 
  [Hryb] We have already registered more than 1,000 foreign 
companies and joint-venture companies. Privatization is rather 
slow because we cannot afford the costs of restructuring. 
Belarus has probably the largest budget sector among all the 
republics of the former Soviet Union -- we maintain 2.5 million 
senior citizens and we subsidies to 2.2 million people who were 
victims of the Chernobyl catastrophe. Thus, almost half of our 
society is maintained by the state budget. These circumstances 
force us to carefully consider all contingencies before making 
any changes. 
  [Graczyk] Do you not fear that the price for this caution 
may be, in the long run, the state's independence? 
  [Hryb] People will always judge the government; they will 
compare the present living standards with the previous period. 
In that period their lives were undoubtedly easier. Thus, they 
are now beginning to blame both the government and independence 
for this fact. 
  [Graczyk] Therefore, the solution to this problem is the 
establishment of a Belarusian-Russian confederation? 
  [Hryb] So far the issue of political structures with Russia 
or other CIS states has not been discussed at all. We are only 
discussing economic cooperation. However, I must concede that 
there are also people who are dreaming about more than that and 
who are striving to achieve it. 
  [Graczyk] It seems that Belarus is the only country in this 
part of Europe which does not believe that Russia is trying to 
conduct an imperial policy. 
  [Hryb] We cannot complain about the cooperation with our 
eastern neighbor; we manage to successfully resolve many 
problems. Russia has more important tasks today than building an 
empire; the most important task for it is to overcome the crisis 
and improve the economy. 
  [Graczyk] The Belarusian opposition claims that Minsk's 
decision of whether or not to join the "Partnership for Peace" 
depends directly on Moscow. 
  [Hryb] We support this American idea; however, we do not 
conceal the fact that it needs some finishing touches. Your 
suggestion that we depend on Russian in this area does not 
correspond to the truth. The most important problem for us is 
first of all money. After joining the "Partnership" we would 
have to spend $5 million a year to implement it. This is the 
only reason why we have not yet signed the document. 
  [Graczyk] Soon you will cede your powers as the head of 
state to the first Belarusian president. What will be -- in 
line with the Constitution -- the mutual relations between him, 
the parliament, and the government? 
  [Hryb] These issues will be finally decided after the 
elections. We would like the new president to be able to take 
part in discussions on this subject. Along with political 
scientists, we are seeking to find the optimum distribution of 
power. We are realists, after all.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Khenik, Belarus minister of Chernobyl </F>
affairs, by Gerd Rosenkranz; place and date not given: 
"Chernobyl Avoided in the Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] [Rosenkranz] What role does the Chernobyl 
disaster play in your country's presidential elections? 
  [Khenik] Fortunately, none of the candidates has made use of 
this bad situation. Not in the polluted regions either. 
  [Rosenkranz] Why fortunately? The catastrophe has made 
people sick, has burdened the budget and economic perspectives. 
Does the population not want the candidates to tell them what 
the future will be like? 
  [Khenik] Our people understand very well what effects the 
disaster still has on the country. Take the 18-percent 
Chernobyl tax that we have had to levy on all firms. There have 
never been any complaints or protests about it, although it 
makes life more difficult than it already is. The disaster has 
been inflicted on our people together, and people are aware of 
this. 
  [Rosenkranz] Does this mean that there is no polarization of 
opinion between the presidential candidates on this issue? 
  [Khenik] No. Most of the candidates have tried to avoid 
this issue in their election campaigns. The central priority in 
the elections is our economic development. 
  [Rosenkranz] What are your feelings in Belarus as you watch 
the Chernobyl nuclear center in the Ukraine still operating? 
  [Khenik] My country has repeatedly appealed to Ukrainian 
President Kravchuk and the parliament in Kiev to cancel the 
decision to maintain operations and reopen the reactor. 
Unfortunately, we have not even received an answer to our 
request to their parliament. Kravchuk asked us to understand 
that there is no other solution owing to the current economic 
situation in Ukraine. 
  [Rosenkranz] Belarus does not have any nuclear power 
stations, but of all the countries concerned it is suffering the 
most from the effects of the accident. Are you getting any 
support from the former Soviet Union? 
  [Khenik] Russia is the only state of the former USSR that 
supports us economically. This year, President Yeltsin wants to 
increase payments to 40 billion roubles. 
  [Rosenkranz] Of the humanitarian help that your country gets 
from the West, 82 percent comes from voluntary organizations and 
individuals, while only 18 percent is from the states. Are 
people in the West more sensitive to your problems than 
governments? 
  [Khenik] It is true that only now, after eight years, has an 
agreement come about with the German Government on cooperation 
in fighting the effects of Chernobyl. Fortunately, several 
German land governments have shown more human decency and have 
supported us, especially Hesse and Lower Saxony. But it is true 
that social organizations and individuals have been doing a 
great deal more. 
  [Rosenkranz] In spite of this situation there have been 
discussions going on in Belarus on whether the problem of energy 
supplies could not best be solved by constructing nuclear power 
stations. Would a party or a presidential candidate taking such 
a position stand a chance of being elected? 
  [Khenik] No. That is why this issue is systematically 
avoided in candidates' speeches. No president would be in a 
position to decide on the construction of nuclear reactors by 
himself, without a referendum. There is no possible location 
where this would not lead to massive protests. 
  [Rosenkranz] What do you think the outcome of a national 
referendum on that issue would be? 
  [Khenik] People would, of course, be against nuclear power, 
no doubt about that. There is no other option: We will have to 
find non-nuclear, alternative sources of energy.

  [Text] Tiraspol, ROMPRES, 22/06/1994 -- General Lebed 
again criticized the Tiraspol leadership in the newspaper 
DNESTROVSKAYA PRAVDA. He stated that "the current Dniester 
leadership has exhausted all its possibilities: it can be 
changed through anticipate elections in the presence of 
observers of international organizations." Lebed insists that 
such elections be held at all management levels. In his 
opinion, a referendum on the confidence to president Igor 
Smirnov should be held. Lebed stated that the Tiraspol leaders 
have no future as "they quarreled with everyone: their friends 
did not come at power in Russia and they destroyed the economy." 
Commenting on the terrorist act against prosecutor Luchik, 
Lebed alleged that the attempt could have been framed by certain 
Tiraspol officials. "The assassin will not be traced out because 
he is among us," stated Lobed. He mentioned that everyone 
points to Bergman to deceive the public. He also stated that 
Dniester's entry into the Union of the Unrecognized Countries 
along with Abkhazia, Crimea and other republics will condemn 
Tiraspol to an eternal unrecognition. Referring to his 
relations with the Moldovan leadership, General Lebed pointed 
out that "as long as Mr. Snegur who instigated the fratricidal 
war is at power I have nothing to talk with him regardless of 
how much I should be provoked to do this." According to him, the 
only Moldovan official with whom he discussed was Varnia mayor 
Cornescu. Lebed discussed with him the fate of the military 
subunit located near this village.

  [Text] Commander of the Fourteenth Russian Army, 
Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed once again criticized the 
Transdniestrian leadership and proposed that new elections be 
held to all power bodies in the self-proclaimed Transdniestrian 
Republic. 
  "We showed people for whom they have been fighting and 
revealed their tricks when running Transdniestria," Lebed said 
in an interview with the Dnestrovskaya Pravda newspaper today. 
He added that the present power had completely outlived its 
time and that the composition of all its bodies must be changed 
through early simultaneous elections monitored by international 
organizations. It would be good also to vote confidence in 
current President Igor Smirnov, Lebed said. 
  He said that Transdniestria had no future with its present 
leadership. "The Transdniestrian people will only be facing 
more disasters and finally Transdniestria as a republic will 
decay from its roots with no external interference. Moldova has 
realized this, calmed down and is just waiting. Only Tiraspol 
is reluctant to understand this. The local leaders are rushing 
ahead without thinking about the disaster lying ahead," Lebed 
said. 
  Lebed said he believed that the Transdniestrian leadership 
must not count on the Russian opposition's coming to power. "It 
is even worse than utopia to hope that Alksnis or Umalatova will 
come to power. It is something fantastic -- not smart enough. 
As far as Zhirinovskiy is concerned, nobody knows definitely 
whether he will need Transdniestria when in power," Lebed said. 
  Lebed categorically refuted the accusations that he had 
concluded a hidden agreement with Moldova and certain Russian 
forces interested in the elimination of the non-recognized 
Transdniestrian Republic. "While Mr Snegur, who has blessed 
this fratricidal war, remains in power, I have nothing to say to 
them," Lebed said.

  [Excerpts] Kishinev [Chisinau], 25 Jun -- In the course of

stationed there, and was acquainted with the operation of its 
special section. 
  The ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from Tiraspol that

Security Ministry, which was signed in Kishinev 24. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the problem of the Dniester region, representatives of 
the 
Russian FCS said: "It should be settled only peacefully, and 
Russian special services will assist this process using all 
legitimate means."

  [Text] The morning Supreme Council session on 23 June was 
attended by Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, who for three 
hours had to answer questions from parliamentarians. 
  The head of government had a difficult time answering 
questions. Deputy Vladimir Chernyshev announced that he, as all 
the citizens of the Republic, for the past 64 months has 
suffered from difficulties caused by the transitional period and 
asked whether the government intends to use the population's 
money in reforms that are being carried out. According to him, 
without this it will not be possible to fulfill the targets. 
  If only 32 ministers participate in building the market 
economy, the prime minister said, we will not achieve anything. 
It is important that the whole nation understands the need for 
the introduction of new economic relations and actively 
participates in this. With regard to the population's money, 
the government envisages restoring the people's trust in 
depositing their money in savings banks. 
  Answering other topical questions Sergey Tereshchenko said 
that ministers are appointed in accordance with the existing 
Constitution. He himself never wrote a resignation application 
and does not intend to do so in the near future. Under the 
present difficult and objectively shaped conditions replacing 
the government will not lead to the immediate improvement of the 
population's life. 
  The prime minister believes that the division of the former 
single administration into a presidential and governmental 
administration, and inclusion [word indistinct] of regional 
administrations into the latter one, is the right step under the 
present circumstances. It will contribute to a more effective 
implementation of a program aimed at speeding up reforms and 
lifting the country's economy out of crisis. As was reported 
earlier, President Nazarbayev suggested reducing the time of its 
implementation to 15 months. 
  The methodology of defining expenditure and revenue parts of 
the state budget for the current year has been dictated by the 
target of bringing inflation down to 8-10 percent. With regard 
to spending connected with the creation of the military and 
naval fleet they could be explained by the need to protect the 
Caspian Sea borders. 
  With regard to the issue of restoring benefits for certain 
categories of the population, Sergey Tereshchenko said, this has 
to be decided by deputies when they endorse the budget, and they 
should take into account the real financial capabilities of the 
state, since you cannot solve all the problems at once. 
  The government thoroughly supervises the foreign debt of the 
state for it not to exceed the sum that could be repaid. 
  Touching upon the subject of the Baykonur space range, the 
prime minister reminded of a relevant agreement that has been 
signed with Russia. After its ratification by the parliaments 
of both countries the republican budget will be replenished at 
the cost of the lease payment by the neighboring state. 
  Our agriculture is still too costly. We spend 30-40 percent 
more per unit of produced good, compared to world standards. 
Under these conditions, allocation of credits to the 
agro-industrial complex is absolutely unprofitable. [Word 
indistinct] mineral fertilizers, new economically beneficial 
machinery and give it an opportunity [word indistinct]. The 
state keeps licenses only for 33 types of exported goods. 
  He said that a change in the tax policy is expected. Taxes 
charged on entrepreneurial activity will be reduced and 
penalties for concealing profits will be increased. 
  In reply to one of the questions, the prime minister said 
that it is economically unprofitable to stop the construction of 
a new presidential residence and sport complex. The decision on 
the construction of them was approved by the previous parliament. 
  He also said that the implementation of the new program is 
not simple and it could only be carried out provided that the 
government and the Supreme Council join their efforts.

  [Excerpts] The international "Agroasia-94" exhibition is 
coming to an end in the republican capital. President 
Nazarbayev attended on 22 June. 
  Judging by the number of foreign companies displaying their 
goods here, we can say that a great number of businessmen are 
willing to cooperate with Kazakhstan and set up joint ventures 
with it. This is what President Nazarbayev said during his 
conversation with Shaffer, a representative of the German 
Ministry of Agriculture, after he familiarized himself with that 
country's equipment. 
  We are willing to manufacture all of them jointly with 
German 
companies. This is a beneficial area for cooperation and we 
have agreed to develop it with Chancellor Kohl. 
  [words indistinct] a basis has been created for setting up 
several Kazakhstan-German joint ventures. In particular, 
everything is ready for starting the joint production of the 
"Class"-type combines in Akmola, beet-lifters, machinery for 
pressing and mowing grass, cleaning and grading grain, and 
pre-sowing soil cultivation. They have been highly appraised by 
farmers and experts from Kazakhstan's center for testing 
machinery. 
  Relevant government agreements are available, [words 
indistinct] technical documentation has been compiled and 
buildings have been found. Germany has allocated the "Hermes" 
special credit line. 
  Unfortunately, we can't use it now, since the Alem-Bank 
despite [words indistinct] hasn't provided us with guarantees 
for the efficient use of the credit and timely return of it. It 
looks like serious financial decisions have to be taken here. 
But we should take them, Nazarbayev said, and as soon as 
possible. This will allow us to start promising new products. 
  "Why is it important for us to have joint ventures," the 
president asked. "Because we have a good basis for this. There 
is a great demand for highly efficient agricultural machinery. 
We have metal for it. At the initial stage we will have to 
purchase parts and units but later on we will be able to master 
their production and create powerful industrial complexes. 
[words indistinct] one of the directions followed by the 
civilzed world." [passage omitted] 
  The president showed interest in the technology by leading 
companies of the world used in the protection of plants and 
processment of agricultural produce, higly efficient equipment 
which could be used in food industry and laboratory equipment 
for checking its quality. He also familiarized himself with the 
latest achievements in telecommunications, and electronic and 
power engineering systems of communications, which are being 
displayed by businessmen from 16 countries of the world at the 
"Atakent" business center.

  [Text] Removal from state control and the privatization of 
state farms is in full swing in the Republic. It concerns state 
farms that process and service enterprises of the 
agro-industrial complex. In order to channel this process, the 
Cabinet of Ministers regularly listens to accounting reports 
from the heads of the oblast administrations and enters the 
necessary changes. On 24 June, the members of the government 
met with Saparbek Kunanbayev, first deputy head of the Kokshetau 
Oblast administration, and Viktor Chumakov, deputy head of the 
Kostanay Oblast administration. 
  Summing up the results of the discussion, Prime Minister 
Sergey Tereshchenko, Agriculture Minister Zhanibek Karibzhanov, 
Kozy-Korpesh Yesenberlin, chairman of the State Property 
Committee, and other members of the government noted the 
unsatisfactory situation in the denationalization and 
privatization of the agro-industrial complex in the republic and 
entered a number of concrete proposals aimed at improving the 
situation. 
  At the next meeting with a similar agenda, the heads of the 
East Kazakhstan and Semey Oblast administrations will report on 
the work being done to restructure the agro-industrial system.

  [Text] The fourth privatization auction was held today. 
But one cannot see any special activity going on at privatized 
enterprises. In fact, the giants of industry are never on sale, 
although at this auction the caliber of enterprises varied. 
Among the 45 enterprises offered for sale are those of the 
light industry, fuel and gas supplying, and machine-building. 
  As has been expected, the least demand of the approximately 
100 funds participating in the auction, was in construction 
industry enterprises, because their capacity is small, the 
infrastructure is not there, and the production base is weak. 
But such enterprises as the Akmolinsk spinning and weaving mill 
or the Karagandaodezhda joint stock company were objects of 
serious battles. The outcome of the fourth auction is as 
follows: 85.3 percent of stock were sold. Of 104 funds that 
contested the tenders, 83 funds bought shares. The others lost 
owing to deliberately low starting prices.

  [Text] The Kazakh Government has decided to speed up the 
commissioning of an oil pipeline from Atyr oil fields to the 
Chimkent and Pavlodar refineries via Aktyubinsk and Kzyl-Orda 
regions. The measure follows the country's dwindling oil 
exports which almost completely dried up in May, President of 
state Munaigaz holding company (production, refining and 
marketing of fuel) Bulat Yelemanov said in an interview with the 
Kazakh Panorama newspaper. 
  Kazakhstan whose annual oil output runs at about 17 million 
tonnes has no direct access to export pipelines or sea ports 
having to export crude oil via Russian territory. 
  Experts say the project will cost some $500 million to 
implement. Yelemanov said that a 7 km-length pipeline to be 
commissioned by the end of 1996 had already been laid down. 
  He accused Russia of blocking all outlets for Kazakhstan's 
oil exports. Yelemanov said Russian oil agencies offer too high 
prices for pumping oil through Russian territory or refer to 
overcapacity on export pipelines. Worse still, Russian oil 
refineries which handle Kazakh oil now refuse to accept it 
because of glut. 
  Officials in Alma-Ata [Almaty] maintain that Russia does not 
want to honor its obligations. It has now agreed to handle only 
one million tonnes of Kazakhstan's crude oil instead of three 
million tonnes as provided under the contract. Experts say the 
country exported only 285,500 tonnes of crude via Russia in the 
first quarter of this year, which is 75 percent of last year's 
level.

  [Text] Deputy commander Aleksandr Bespalov of the Russian 
border troops told INTERFAX that the Tajik Government-in-exile 
was directly responsible for the terrorist actions against 
Russian servicemen in Tajikistan. 
  According to Bespalov, forces of the Black Imam group played 
the leading role in the terrorist actions. General Bespalov 
described them as fanatical and exceptionally ferocious. The 
latest assault on Russian border guards was reported in Dushanbe 
on 24 June. 
  Bespalov said that on orders from the Tajik opposition 
leaders and the commander-in-chief of the opposition forces 
Rezvon, opposition buildup continued in the Shuroabad, Darvaz 
and Bakhorak directions on the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border. 
  The Tajik opposition leaders issued orders for the 
Badakhshan 
group of forces to move from central Afghanistan to the border 
areas and eventually into Tajikistan. Iranian, Pakistani, and 
Saudi mercenaries had joined the Tajik fighting units. A field 
hospital for Tajik forces and mercenaries had opened in the 
Afghan city of Chakhiab. Nationals of Islamic countries worked 
on its staff, General Bespalov said. 
  All that proved, Bespalov said, that the Tajik opposition 
leaders aimed to launch a new round of hostilities. Those who 
opposed moves for peace on the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border and 
inside Tajikistan, he stressed, would be held responsible for 
escalating violence.

  [Text] Tehran 26 June TASS -- The second round of talks 
between the Tajik Government and opposition leaders, which is to 
complete here on Monday, has not marked any considerable 
breakthrough so far. According to well-informed sources, the 
conflicting sides are unlikely to sign an agreement on a 
cease-fire for the period of the Tehran talks. However, the 
negotiating parties still hope to break the deadlock. 
  The second round of Tajik talks is expected to result in 
signing a protocol to reiterate the commitment of both the 
former Soviet republic's government and anti-government forces 
to a political settlement of their differences at the 
negotiating table, the U.N. special envoy for Tajikistan told 
TASS on Sunday [26 June]. Another protocol is expected to be 
signed with a view to set up a joint commission, which will 
discuss settlement issues in periods between the rounds of 
talks. This commission will work in Moscow. 
  In their respective interviews with TASS, the negotiating 
parties accused each other of dragging out the talks and 
rejecting any compromises. A Russian observer noted, however, 
that the opposition leaders could give up linking the proposed 
cease-fire to political amnesty in Tajikistan, termination of 
criminal proceedings against political detainees and freedom to 
political parties and the press. The government delegation 
agrees to these demands in principle, but stresses that a 
cease-fire should come first.

  [Text] Dushanbe 27 June TASS -- An unspecified number of 
Tajik opposition militants were killed over the weekend when 
Russian border guards in Tajikistan shelled the frontier with 
Afghanistan cutting short three armed attempts to break into the 
Central Asian republic. 
  The Russian frontier troops in Tajikistan said on Monday the 
strikes were delivered on river crossing areas by border guards 
of the Pyandzh and Moskovskiy Districts. 
  None of the Russian soldiers were wounded.

<F P=106> [From the "Birzhevoy Vestnik Vostoka" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] The UN Development Program has allocated $1 
million in support of privatization in Uzbekistan for a period 
of 12 months. 
  A BVV [Birzhevoi Vestnik Vostoka] correspondent was told by 
Julian Watts, the director of programs of industrial development 
of the UNO/UNIDO [UN Industrial Development Organization], that 
this amount will be used for consultation services, expertise of 
privatization legislation, setting up of a program of mass 
privatization together with the State Committee on Property, the 
creation of a modern information system, and audit and 
accounting services. [passage omitted] 
  According to the State Committee on Property, 53,000 
enterprises out of the 65,000 registered have changed their form 
of ownership over the two years of privatization. Mainly 
shareholders' societies and small family enterprises have been 
set up. The privatization of housing is over. Approximately 1 
million apartments, or 98 percent of their total number, have 
been privatized. The privatization of light industry 
enterprises will start shortly and finish by 1 May 1995. The 
method of creating open shareholders' societies has been chosen. 
Similarly, it is expected that foreign capital will take part. 
  Here is some more sensational news. The privatization of 
patrol stations has started as an experiment, though according 
to the present regulations they belonged to enterprises that 
could not be privatized. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On Saturday [25 June], Uzbekistan's President Islam 
Karimov told his ministers and government executives that the 
Republic would work for the convertibility of its new currency 
unit -- som, respect for it at the international marketplace and 
its high buying potential. The som is to replace the som-coupon 
on the domestic market on 1 July. The som-coupon was introduced 
in November 1993. 
  Karimov called for the priority of exports and increased 
production of competitive goods. 
  He was worried about the growth of prices for many items on 
the domestic market and demanded tighter control of commercial 
stores which, he said, bought production of state-managed 
facilities to sell it at inadequate prices to the population. 
That, in Karimov's view, could lead to the devaluation of the 
new currency unit.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 26 
June broadcasts the weekly "Itogi" program, which features a 
four-minute interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the 
Russian Federation Council, in which he explains his recent 
proposals on prolonging the mandates of Federal Assembly 
deputies for two years. 
  First, Shumeyko states the main points of his proposal, 
stressing that President Yeltsin had nothing to do with that 
initiative: "Changing the existing laws and the corresponding 
articles of the Constitution immediately and turning the 
Federation Council into a more efficient body will enable us, 
the current deputies, to deal with various issues on a deeper 
level. I will not conceal from you that it is necessary to 
introduce amendments into the Constitution, prolonging the 
mandates both for the State Duma and the Federation Council for 
at least two years. It has only just become possible for 
deputies to pass laws and tackle legislative issues, but instead 
they are being confronted with a completely different problem--a 
new election. In my opinion, a fresh election will upset 
Russia's balance to the utmost degree. I have not said a single 
word about the president in this connection." 
  Shumeyko then comments on the public reaction to this 
proposal: "I read the newspapers yesterday--the reaction is 
quite normal. Who then distorted my meaning most and who has 
been criticizing and accusing me of immorality? SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA, PRAVDA, Baburin, and Gorbachev--there is life in the 
old dog yet! This means that I was right. These people do not 
want political accord, they do not want stable work to begin in 
Russia--that is all." 
  Shumeyko then explains the reasons behind his initiative: 
"At 
this stage, I can see no point in a change of power because 
Russia will never come back to the state it was in when it was 
part of the Soviet Union. This is impossible. Since we have 
achieved political accord, the entire society now has to think 
about the quickest way for our state to overcome this poverty 
and crisis." 
  He says that social problems mattered more to the Russians 
at 
this stage: "The politicians ought to feel that people are tired 
of these endless elections. They need anything but elections. 
They need a job, a salary, a normal life, and a developing 
state structure. They want the achievements of this state that 
have been recorded in its Constitution to exist in real terms. 
They want to be rid of crime and want courts to work normally, 
and many other things, but not elections."

<F P=106> [NG report under the "In Brief" rubric: "A Second Kite"] </F>
  [Text] A high-ranking representative of the Kremlin, 
expressing his personal point of view in an interview for 
INTERFAX, has not ruled out that the Russian president might 
call a national referendum on extending the head of state's 
powers for another term. Commenting -- on condition of anonymity 
-- on Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative 
calling for extending the powers of the parliamentarians and the 
head of state, he noted that Boris Yeltsin "has every chance of 
winning the 1996 presidential elections and, to all appearances, 
will not agree to the State Duma's and the Federation Council's 
deciding on the question of his powers." At the same time, the 
INTERFAX interlocutor conceded that Vladimir Shumeyko's 
proposals for extending the deputies' term of office for another 
two years "has logic and a profound sense," because this 
initiative would enable most parliamentarians who lack political 
experience to be "road-tested" and concentrate in the next few 
years on lawmaking activity. This has confirmed analysts' views 
that Mr. Shumeyko continues to act as a middleman at the request 
of top Kremlin officials from a party supporting President 
Yeltsin. By taking this step they have delivered a blow at 
their opponents who have been trying to win Yeltsin over, or, as 
a last-resort measure, to make sure that he is ousted in the 
next elections. According to reports from alternative sources, 
INTERFAX's interlocutor was a man with a beard.

  [Text] Political equilibrium in the country is such that 
most people would favour prolonged presidential and 
parliamentary powers, Vice-Premier Shakhray, leading the Duma's 
PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] faction, has declared 
in an exclusive interview with Interfax. In his opinion, such 
prolongation could be welcomed even by the opposition "since 
none of its leaders would stand a chance to win the 1996 
presidential race." 
  Shakhray is convinced that such possible extension could be 
objected only by the ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy and 
that part of the political opposition which is not represented 
in the Federal Assembly. He stressed that the key role in 
persuading the public to accept such possibility could be played 
by "regional political elite", which would support it, if the 
powers of all authorities, from top to bottom, were prolonged to 
contribute to stability. 
  He believes that the president would "keep a pause" on the 
matter longer than anyone else. 
  "In a transitional period, elections makes it possible to 
let 
the steam off a politically explosive boiler and thereby prevent 
what happened on October 3-4, 1993," Shakhray believes. 
  As a legal basis to make this idea work, Shakhray suggests 
that a law be passed to introduce amendments into the 
constitution for an interim period. However, he emphasized that 
its passage would require no less than two thirds of votes in 
the Duma and three fourths of votes in the Federation Council, 
and its ratification would need support from two thirds of the 
Federation members.

  [Text] The Russian Businessmen Union's President Arkadiy 
Volskiy has dismissed as immoral Federation Council Chairman 
Vladimir Shumeyko's recent proposal to prolong the mandates of 
the Federal Assembly's deputies. 
  "Each of the deputies went to elections, knowing that he 
would be elected for two years," Volskiy declared at a 
news-conference in Moscow Friday, noting that the prolongation 
offer was "very mean towards the State Duma and Federation 
Council." 
  He also criticized the presidential anti-crime decree since 
it presupposes the right of arbitrary rule. However, he quoted 
a number of industrial managers as saying that most people are 
in favor of the decree. 
  "The best thing would be to erase from the decree the 
rubbish 
like the right to detain people for 30 days," Volskiy said. 
  According to him, "it was in fact Russia rather than the 
USSR 
that collapsed" in 1991. "The rupture of economic ties was the 
chief reason for production decline," he remarked. 
  In his opinion, Russia and other former USSR republics 
should 
set up a really workable economic union, if they want to 
overcome the crisis as soon as possible. Otherwise, enterprises 
will have to establish direct ties, he said. The problem could 
also be resolved by forming transnational corporations across 
the former USSR.

  [Text] Irkutsk June 24 TASS -- "The presidential decree 
against gangsterism is the first step in extraordinary 
legislation against crime. Attitudes to the decree may differ 
but I think we are doomed to this," Russian Vice-Premier Sergey 
Shakhray told correspondents here today. 
  Shakhray has finished a trip to the extreme northern areas 
with a governmental delegation to analyze goods supplies and 
will attend a meeting of the council of the "Siberian Agreement" 
interregional association. 
  Efforts of all power branches should be pulled in measures 
against organized crime, stressed Shakhray. A corresponding 
draft law has been approved by the government and submitted to 
the State Duma. 
  Asked about his opinion of the proposal to prolong powers of 
deputies, the president and other power structures, Shakhray 
said "i almost do not doubt that the deal of political elites -- 
prolongation of the Civic Accord Treaty -- will not result in 
any elections till the end 1998. This can be legalized only 
with a constitutional amendment or a constitutional law". 
  Speaking of goods delivery to the extreme northern areas, 
Shakhray said extreme measures will have to be taken if the 
goods are not transported on rivers in July. This first of all 
goes for oil products, coal and foodstuffs. Otherwise, they 
will have to evacuate residents from the extreme zones.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin's 
decree on combatting gangsterism in the country comes into 
effect today. The law enforcement agencies are ready to start 
intensive work in keeping with the decree, according to First 
Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikhail Yegorov. 
  Yegorov said that violations of human rights can be avoided 
if the public is duly informed about any measures taken in line 
with the presidential decree. "Glasnost" (openness) is the main 
guarantor against any abuse of power by police, Yegorov stressed. 
  The signing of the president's decree was made necessary by 
experience, the deputy minister said. Organised criminal gangs 
are becoming increasing well-armed, ferocious and begin to 
dictate society their own terms with their gangland wars and 
explosions. Many hostages are being kept for ransom. Cases have 
been reported of close cooperation between Russian gangs with 
American cosa nostra and Sicilian mafia.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Klimov: "Working Together"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday's enlarged sitting of the collegium of 
the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office involving 
prosecutors from the republics, krays, and oblasts, and military 
and transport prosecutors, was devoted to the theme of the fight 
against crime. State structure representatives, including 
Presidential Staff Chief S. Filatov, Federation Council 
Committee Chairman I. Kostoyev, and Human Rights Committee 
Chairman S. Kovalev, took part in the collegium's work. 
  The trend toward a rise in organized crime, which is 
destabilizing the atmosphere in society, was noted in the report 
by Acting General Prosecutor A. Ilyushenko, as well as in the 
speeches by regional prosecutors and those by the leaders of law 
enforcement organs. 
  Various appraisals of the president's edict were heard. 
Federal Counterintelligence Service Director S. Stepashin 
declared: "I am in favor of violating the rights of the 
individual if that person is a criminal." S. Kovalev 
categorically disagreed with this conclusion, placing the 
emphasis on the unswerving fulfillment of human rights and 
compliance with the spirit and letter of the Constitution. 
  Other speeches also noted the possible danger of "going too 
far" in terms of human rights compliance when fulfilling the 
president's edict. 
  The collegium called on prosecutors to consider the fight 
against crime and the coordination of the actions of the law 
enforcement bodies the most important area of their activity. 
It was proposed that constant surveillance over compliance with 
legislation be guaranteed when carrying out measures stipulated 
by the president and the parliament to protect the population 
from organized crime.

  [Text] Kishinev June 25 TASS -- "In keeping with the 
current legislation all investigative and operational activities 
will affect people's rights in one way or another. Without this 
it will be impossible to fight crime," Russian 
Counterintelligence Service Chief Sergey Stepashin said. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, 
Stepashin said that "any operational activities inevitably limit 
the rights of criminals. This is an axiom. In this connection 
I would like to say again that I am for violation of the `right' 
of criminals to kill, rob, rape and encroach upon the rights of 
other people and their life. I am for such limitations, 
provided all procedural norms ensuring the calm life of the 
citizens of Russia are observed."

  [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS -- Liberal-Democratic Party 
leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy believes that the police is so 
corrupted it is unable to carry out anti-crime measures. The 
police should be replaced with retired KGB officers, said 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  In his opinion, the federal counter-intelligence service is 
also unable to suppress crime since it "assists foreign secret 
services". The latter, in their turn, concentrated on the 
Russian Liberal-Democratic Party. Zhirinovskiy thinks that the 
border should be partially closed and citizens of former Soviet 
republics should be prohibited to visit large Russian cities for 
six months in order to make anti-crime measures efficient. 
  "We demand to start anti-crime measures with cleansing of 
the 
Interior Ministry itself, removal of corrupted officials and 
their replacement with retired officers of the KGB, the armed 
forces and the Military Procurator's Office. If the 
high-ranking officials are not replaced, the presidential decree 
(against crime) will become an instrument against political 
opponents and not criminals," Zhirinovskiy told a news 
conference here today. 
  He also demanded to stop "predatory privatization", do not 
hold joint exercises with NATO, do not send Russian peace-makers 
outside the Russian Federation and raise the minimum salary to 
50,000 rubles per month.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Juridical Sciences Vladimir Osin, </F>
Associate of the Russian Federation Interior Ministry All-Union 
Scientific Research Institute, under the "Edict Adopted. What 
Next?" rubric: "Emergency Measures Against Bandits"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation president's edict "On Urgent 
Measures To Protect the Population Against Banditry and Other 
Manifestations of Organized Crime" has produced conflicting 
assessments among both scientists and practical workers of the 
law enforcement agencies. It is perceived by some as a 
long-awaited measure which will immediately help to combat 
various criminal groups, whereas in others it inspires a fear of 
arbitrary rule by the authorities. To arrive at a correct 
verdict on the extraordinary measures planned by the president 
for combatting manifestations of organized crime it is necessary 
to look at the possible consequences, both positive and 
negative, of their implementation. 
  The crime situation in Russia has begun to deteriorate 
sharply in recent months. Showdowns among criminals in the big 
cities are increasingly resembling military operations. 
  Meanwhile, the prevailing law enforcement practice and the 
conflicting nature of the norms of the existing criminal and 
criminal-procedural legislation are not always conducive to 
exposing criminal organizations. The many months of work by 
operational subunits often end in the conviction only of those 
who actually commit a specific offense. The article in our 
Criminal Code envisaging liability for banditry (Article 77 of 
the Russian Federation Criminal Code) never really did work, and 
it is still being applied only in very rare instances. 
  Furthermore, the Russian Federation Supreme Court's rulings 
on the application of this article have simply made it harder to 
qualify bandit attacks. That is why the courts are continuing 
to qualify an act committed by a gang as an act of theft, 
robbery, extortion, or murder by a group. 
  Nor does the draft law "On the Struggle Against Organized 
Crime," which is being prepared by a State Duma committee, 
inspire hope. This draft law does not take into account the 
existing legal system in Russia or the principles and provisions 
characteristic of a rule of law state. 
  Is this not reason enough to understand the urgent need for 
the adoption of emergency legal measures by the Russian 
president? 
  Everyone who speaks out against the edict should note that 
it 
does not replace the existing legislation but merely gives the 
operational services greater scope for gathering information not 
about individual crimes but primarily about criminal groups. 
  The only deviation from the rules laid down by procedural 
law 
is in regard to those crimes typically committed by gangs or 
other forms of organized criminal group suspected of committing 
serious crimes. 
  Prior to the edict the existing law not only did not oblige 
but did not even encourage the law enforcement agencies to try 
to expose a criminal organization. The edict, however, directs 
the operational services precisely toward exposing criminal 
organizations. For that purpose alone is it permissible, prior 
to the institution of criminal proceedings, to carry out expert 
appraisals and hold preliminary investigations into the 
financial and economic activity and the property and financial 
status not only of suspected persons but also of those close to 
them. 
  Such harsh deviations from citizens' democratic rights and 
freedoms enshrined in the Russian Federation Constitution are 
dictated by the need to protect Russia's citizens from the orgy 
of crime. Such actions, incidentally, are characteristic of any 
democratic state which is compelled to fight organized crime. 
  The edict stipulates the use of the emergency measures 
powers 
only when there is sufficient evidence of an individual's 
involvement in a gang or other organized criminal group which is 
justifiably suspected of having committed serious crimes and not 
just any crime. The use of the emergency measures on other 
grounds must be viewed as an abuse of power or an offense 
against justice. 
  Mistakes are possible, of course, as is the deliberate abuse 
of the norms of the edict in a number of cases. But the 
institution of prosecutor's oversight exists for that purpose. 
The edict clearly prescribes that all emergency measures must 
be coordinated with the Prosecutor's Office. 
  Each instance of an operational investigation into an 
individual's involvement in a gang or other organized criminal 
group must be recorded and the results of the corresponding work 
must be entered in the files of the operational investigation in 
question. The materials contained in such files make it 
possible to answer the question of whether the implementation of 
the emergency measures is legal and necessary. 
  Every one whose guilt is not proven in the manner prescribed 
by law is entitled to receive on demand a report on the nature 
of the information pertaining to him. It is possible to appeal 
to the court against a refusal to provide such information. 
Thus the existing legislation and, in particular, the Law "On 
Operational Investigation Activity" provides a guarantee against 
excessive use of power by an "overzealous official." 
  There have been many criticisms of the detention of suspects 
and accused persons for a period of up to 30 days. For some 
reason, however, people disregard the fact that someone accused 
of a serious crime may already be detained in custody for over a 
year solely on the grounds of the gravity of the offense 
(Article 96 of the Russian Federation Criminal Code). Under the 
edict only a suspect's involvement in a gang or other group 
suspected of committing a serious offense allows that person to 
be kept in custody for up to 30 days. 
  There is the danger, of course, that these emergency 
measures 
-- when applied by nonprofessionals, bogus individuals, or 
people who like to kick up a fuss about "high-profile cases" -- 
are a dangerous weapon which could lead to violence on the part 
of certain law enforcement agencies, which will undermine still 
further the Russian population's faith in them. Thus it would 
be advisable to grant such powers only to subunits of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service and the Russian Federation 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] Main Directorate for 
Combatting Organized Crime as the agencies best prepared to 
track down and wipe out criminal organizations. 
  Public opinion would possibly be reassured by being kept 
informed about the practical implementation of this edict. 
  There is one more point which merits the public's attention. 
Having been given further scope for combatting manifestations of 
organized crime, staffers of the law enforcement agencies must 
understand that citizens' patience has already been exhausted. 
If those who have been given the task of combatting criminal 
organizations cannot make proper use of the emergency powers 
granted them by the edict it would be better for them to stand 
down. I believe that we will find people who are equal to this 
task. So let us assess this work according to its actual 
results and not according to some mythical dangers.

  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod, 26 Jun -- Analyzing the political 
situation in the country, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
LDPR (Liberal Democratic Party of Russia), has not ruled out the 
possibility of dissolution of the State Duma and introduction of 
direct presidential rule in the next few months. He arrived in 
Nizhniy Novgorod today together with members of the LDPR group 
of deputies in the State Duma. 
  The city's residents showed particular interest in a rally 
held in its main square. At the rally, the party leader 
reiterated that "there has been no real change in the lives of 
the people of Russia following the elections." This is why, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy explained, "we are in opposition, and if 
we do not succeed in replacing this government, we do not rule 
out the possibility that we ourselves would cancel the Treaty on 
Social Accord we signed earlier."

  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jun -- "To unite the forces of people's 
deputies of all levels, from the union level to rayon soviets, 
including deputies of the present elected authorities, in the 
fight for the restoration of a single union state, the Soviet 
Union." This task was set at the third congress of the "Union" 
popular movement [narodnoye dvizheniye "Soyuz"], held today at 
the Russian Federation parliamentary center. 
  The movement was set up in December 1990 on the basis of the 
"Union" group of deputies, which advocated the preservation of a 
centralized unitarian state and "emergency measures to steer the 
country out of crisis." Its second congress was held in April 
1991, so the present forum was the first since the breakup of 
the USSR. The congress organizers claim they managed to gather 
330 deputies of various levels, including 33 former people's 
deputies of the USSR, 20 former people's deputies of the Russian 
Federation, and four State Duma deputies. Apart from them, the 
congress was attended by representatives from parties and public 
movements, mainly of the communist and nationalist-patriotic 
orientation. 
  The delegates approved a resolution that proclaims the 
intention to submit to the parliaments of former republics of 
the USSR a proposal to denounce the Belovezhskaya Pushcha 
agreements, and also to urge all public movements in the 
independent states [of the CIS] "to start work on expanding 
interrepublican ties and forming on the basis of these ties a 
broad movement for the restoration of a single state." The 
movement expressed its intention to take an active part in 
preparing the second "Congress of Peoples of the USSR," which is 
scheduled for October-November 1994. The congress approved 
"theses of a blueprint for the restoration of a union state," 
proposed by the previous congress. 
  Former USSR People's Deputy Sazhi Umalatova said in an 
interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent she was confident 
that "all the republic without exceptions, including the Baltic 
ones," would return to the revived union. However, Viktor 
Alksnis, a leader of the "Union" group of deputies, told the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent that he cherished no particular 
illusions about the movement's prospects. Much will depend on 
whether there are funds, he noted.

<F P=106> ["Own information" report under the "Intrigue" rubric: </F>
"Shumeyko's Department Has Decided To Make the Constitutional 
Court Really Insignificant. A New Approach to the Constitution 
Has Begun"] 
  [Text] There is no disputing the fact that the new Russian 
Constitution, adopted 12 December last year, is far from 
perfect. But, while the Fundamental Law has been in force, so 
many attempts -- either malicious or out of ignorance -- have 
already been made on it that there is nothing left for us but to 
put our trust in its defense by the Constitutional Court, which 
has virtually been inoperative in Russia for more than six 
months now. 
  If you recall, the Constitutional Court's activity was 
suspended by the president's celebrated Edict No. 1400, and its 
activity was frozen, while the Constitutional Court itself was 
mentioned only occasionally in connection either with a hunger 
strike by one of the judges, or with a fire in its building's 
turret, or with the possible departure of Valeriy Zorkin in 
order to enter politics. 
  Nevertheless, during this time work was already under way on 
a new law on the Constitutional Court. The draft law was sent 
to the State Duma, and a conciliation commission was set up 
together with the committee under the leadership of V. Isakov. 
After several amendments were made, the draft law was adopted 
on its first reading, after which it was sent back for 
additional work. Amendments from the Federation Council were 
expected before 15 June. 
  The next reading of the law was scheduled for today, and the 
draft law was duplicated. Suddenly a 15-page package of 
amendments -- 52 in all -- arrived 22 June from the Committee 
for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reform. Some of them are 
of a purely formal nature, and some are simply unexpected, such 
as, for example, the exclusion of constitutional control from 
the Constitutional Court's functions. 
  Until recently the Constitutional Court comprised 13 judges. 
According to the new draft law, it remained to choose six more 
(10 candidacies were submitted to the president over a month 
ago, but Yeltsin has not yet made a decision in this regard). 
But the amendments submitted by the Federation Council provide 
for the reelection of all the Constitutional Court judges 
(elected for life!) -- which will still further delay both the 
adoption of the law on the Constitutional Court and the start of 
its work. The amendments submitted by the Federation Council 
include proposals for the court chairman to be appointed by the 
Federation Council itself, not by the already elected 
composition. 
  There are grounds for fearing that there will very soon 
arise 
a further serious cause for discussion by the Constitutional 
Court. Which does not exist in Russia.

  [Text] The congress of the Republican Party of Russia today 
elected 38-year old Vladimir Lysenko its chairman. He was a 
cochairman of the party jointly with Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy. 
Yesterday, the congress introduced changes to the rules, 
introducing the posts of chairman and deputy chairman instead of 
the institution of cochairmen. Both Lysenko and Shostakovskiy 
are State Duma deputies. They are members of the Yabloko 
faction. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the faction, reported 
several days ago that within the next few days the faction would 
discuss the question of expelling Lysenko from the faction, 
because his actions run counter to the stand of the majority. 
  At the congress yesterday, Lysenko spoke out against the 
party going into opposition on a course pursued by the president 
and the government. Shostakovskiy favored a democratic 
alternative to this course.

  [Text] A seminar of opposition publications chief editors 
took place in the PRAVDA office. Those represented were NASH 
VYBOR of Bashkiria [Bashkortostan], VOLGOGRADSKAYA TRIBUNA, 
CHEBOKSARSKIYE NOVOSTI, TULA TRUDOVAYA, among others from 
Ulyanovsk, Pskov, Novgorod, Kaluga, Penza, as well as SOVETSKAYA 
ROSSIYA and a number of other Moscow newspapers -- more than 50 
all told. 
  Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party of Russia 
Central Executive Committee, who was present at the seminar, 
told the gathering about the political situation in the country 
and the tasks before the Communist Party of Russia in the 
immediate period. In conclusion he answered some questions. In 
particular, answering a question on the role of trade unions, he 
remarked there is yet no sign of active protection for the 
working people on their part. 
  Valentin Chikin, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA chief editor, suggested 
that an opposition press bureau be set up for greater 
cooperation and consolidation. He also proposed the creation of 
a professional association of journalists of opposition 
newspapers which could uphold their interests before the state.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- We are wholly in favor of 
channelling most of the finance Russia receives from abroad 
directly into the investment sphere, Viktor Chernomyrdin told 
today's session of the Consultative Council on Foreign 
Investment in the office of the Russian Government. 
  The head of the cabinet expressed confidence that there 
already exists the necessary prerequisites for shifting the 
emphasis of Western financial support for reform in Russia. 
Traditional loans whose repayment is directly guaranteed by the 
Russian Government should be abandoned in favor of targeted 
financing for specific projects, based on collateral and other 
ways of ensuring that loans are repaid, he remarked. 
  Chernomyrdin singled out five main areas on which the 
Russian 
Government will focus as it implements policy on attracting 
large-scale foreign investment. 
  First, it will strive to ensure that legislation regulating 
the activities of foreign investors is as complete and settled 
as it should be. 
  Second, it will seek changes to the tax system designed to 
stimulate production and investment. 
  Third, it will pursue a vigorous investment policy, in the 
context of which it intends to allocate most centralized 
financial resources on a competitive basis, promote mixed (state 
and private sector) funding, provide government guarantees for 
investment and improve the system of insurance for capital 
investment. 
  Fourth, competition in industry and, especially, banking 
should be given the utmost encouragement. 
  Fifth, foreign investors will be given the legal information 
they need. 
  The prime minister referred to legal enactments regulating 
enterprises with foreign investment that are in the pipeline. 
He said that draft laws envisaged a number of major changes to 
the tax position of foreign investors. Enterprises with foreign 
investment are expected to be exempted from profits tax for five 
years after registration. Restrictions on operations connected 
with the movement of capital are likely to be lifted and foreign 
investors (i.e. enterprises with 100 percent foreign capital) 
will be granted the right to own land on which they build new 
enterprises, installations, or production facilities. 
  Furthermore, enterprises with foreign investment will be 
allowed to keep all the hard currency earnings from exports of 
their own goods. Machinery, technological equipment, spare 
parts, raw and other materials, components,and semi-finished 
goods that enterprises import for their own production needs 
will be exempted from tax levies and customs duty.

  [Text] The Russian government has drafted a number of 
measures to lower foreign investors' risks in Russia, Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced on Monday. 
  He told the constituent conference of the Council for 
Foreign 
Investment that the Cabinet had developed legal norms providing 
for major changes in the taxing regime for foreign investors. 
For instance, enterprises with joint Russian-foreign capital 
will be freed from taxes for five years following registration; 
limitations on the movement of capital will be lifted, while 
enterprises founded entirely with foreign capital will be given 
the right to own the land on which they are located. 
  Chernomyrdin said that changes in the domestic scene allowed 
President Yeltsin to use his enormous reform potential much more 
efficiently. As an example he referred to the packages of 
economic decrees, aimed at accelerating reform and putting 
industrial production on a new footing. 
  Chernomyrdin also said that the Russian economy was fully 
working on the basic laws of the market economy and that its 
response to market fluctuations had become more predictable. He 
said that the external situation was favorable for overcoming 
the crisis and for stable economic development. 
  He spoke about the progress made during the talks with the 
London and Paris clubs on the restructuring of Russia's foreign 
debt inherited from the Soviet Union, and about the conclusion 
of the agreement on partnership and cooperation with the 
European Union. He announced that during his recent visit to the 
U.S. the first step was made towards granting Russia 
most-favored-nation status. 
  The conference is attended by the leaders of major world 
companies, including BASF (Germany), Coca Cola, Ernst &amp; 
Young, 
Procter &amp; Gamble (the U.S.), representatives of Japanese, 
French 
and British firms, and Russian business people.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The inflow of foreign 
investments in the Russian economy will reach 10-15 billion 
American dollars per annum by the year 2000, according to First 
Deputy Economics Minister of Russia Yakov Urinson. He spoke at 
a meeting of the Consultative Council on Foreign Investments 
under the Russian Government which opened in Moscow's President 
Hotel today. 
  The meeting is being attended by the leaders of 14 major 
transnational corporations of the world. 
  "So far the annual growth rate of foreign investments has 
been recorded at a low level, Yakov Urinson said. This year, 
for example, the total amount of investments reached a mere one 
billion dollars, less than in Estonia. Russia is behind such 
countries as Poland, Hungary and some others as regards foreign 
investments. As of June 1, 1994, only 14,000 enterprises with 
foreign capital has have been recorded on the Russian state 
register. 
  Nonetheless, its attempts to lure cautious Western investors 
Russia scored tangible results in stabilising its economic 
conditions, Urinson said. Economic restructuring is being 
carried out along with demilitarising the Russian economy -- 
over the past two years and a half the military order was cut by 
70 per cent, inflation does not exceed 10 per cent a month over 
the past five months. More than 40 per cent of the Russian 
labour force are employed in private enterprises, and the 
rouble's buying capacity against the dollar has increased by 12 
per cent over the past five months of this year. 
  Enterprises with foreign capital have created approximately 
300,000 new jobs, productivity has increased by 1.5 to two times 
on average as compared to similar domestic enterprises, Urinson 
said.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The consultative Foreign 
Investment Council attached to the Russian Government is 
entrusted with working out the strategy for investing foreign 
capital to Russia, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said in a 
conversation with Western businessmen who have arrived in Moscow 
to participate in the council meeting which opens today. 
  Judging by all appearances, the consultative council will 
mark another phase in rapprochement between the Russian and 
world economies hot on the heels of the Russian president's 
recent successful trip to Corfu and of the prime minister's 
visit to the United States. 
  The council meeting today is to be addressed by Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin, First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets, 
Central Bank Governor Viktor Gershchenko and Acting Finance 
Minister Sergey Dubinin. The leaders of Russian key ministries 
and the departments are taking part in the council meeting. 
  Representatives of transnational corporations of North 
America, Europe and Asia are taking part in the meeting. 
Western businessmen said in the conversation with the Russian 
prime minister that they would like to see a better organisation 
of the consultative council's work. They called for setting up 
panels and deciding on the specific directions of work.

<F P=106> [Report by Gleb Cherkasov under the "Hard Work at Harvest </F>
Time" rubric: "Zaveryukha Is Against Grain Imports. He Needs 
Money To Provide Country With Grain"] 
  [Text] Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, speaking 
in a press conference yesterday, voiced the hope this year's 
grain production will be 90 or 95 million tonnes. While this 
year's production is less than last year's (99 million tonnes), 
the vice premier is convinced that Russia may virtually do 
without grain imports. Everyone, however, will have to work 
hard to achieve this goal -- those who gather in the harvest, 
and those who support the process financially and technically. 
  The government will supposedly earmark 5.2 trillion rubles 
in 
centralized credits and 4.6 trillion rubles in a budget loan to 
get ready for and to gather in the harvest. In the vice 
premier's words, 90 percent of the money will be going out to 
the regions with the aim of forming regional grain funds. 
Besides, the grain growers will be provided with an opportunity 
to lease the necessary equipment or buy it on an installment 
plan. Mr. Zaveryukha stressed: The money should be made 
available in the shortest possible time, otherwise a successful 
grain harvest may be disrupted. At any rate, the vice premier 
was not prepared to give approximate prices of the grain to be 
gathered in, remarking only that prices should include all 
labor, material, and technical inputs. 
  Touching on the food production situation on the whole, 
Aleksandr Zaveryukha sadly noted that the situation remains 
difficult and that production is declining. He pointed out, 
however, that production in the private sector grew somewhat. 
Minutes later, however, Mr. Zaveryukha stated that most of the 
agricultural producers are joint-stock companies, that is to 
say, private enterprises. This makes people wonder as to where 
production is declining.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin urged to ensure full safety at nuclear power plants and 
develop ecologically pure reactors and technologies, while the 
Russian patriarch added that nuclear research does not 
contradict the will of God. 
  "Further development of atomic power-engineering is possible 
only under condition of full nuclear and radioactive safety, as 
well as reliable guarantees of ecologically-pure reactors," 
Yeltsin said on Monday in his message to the workers of the 
industry in connection with the 40th anniversary of the first 
Soviet nuclear power plant in Obninsk. 
  Congratulating the workers on the occasion Yeltsin said that 
atomic power engineering has achieved "impressing successes" 
over the years. "However, mankind has more than once seen how 
dear is the price of mistakes in the complicated industry, what 
tragic consequences can they pose for millions of people," 
Yeltsin said. He added that top-level skills of responsibility 
of the personnel of the plants is a major safety condition. 
  The worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 in Chernobyl in 
Ukraine when the fourth reactor of the plant there exploded 
causing powerful contamination of considerable territories in 
Ukraine, Byelorussia [Belarus] and Russia. 
  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin also congratulated atomic 
energy workers saying "it is necessary to assess the role of the 
atomic power-engineering in the Russian development as a stable 
source of energy." 
  Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia Aleksiy the Second 
stressed in his congratulatory message that "comprehending great 
possibilities which the nature possesses and which can serve for 
the benefit of man corresponds to the will of God."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Judging by the intensity with 
which specialists of the Russian research centre Kurchatovskiy 
Institute, and their colleagues from the United States, Germany, 
France and Japan are working on a new project, all nuclear power 
plants will be disaster proof in a few years. Vice-President of 
the Kurchatovskiy Institute Ponomarev-Stepnoy told ITAR-TASS the 
theoretical part of the project is nearing completion and the 
first experiments will be carried out using simulators in a year 
or two. 
  The project aims to develop a multi-tier system of nuclear 
plant protection with the help of which all radioactive 
emissions will be "trapped". 
  Even if the worst happens and the reactor active zone melts 
as it did in Chernobyl, specialists are sure that the heightened 
radioactivity will never leave the boundaries of the reactor 
proper. 
  The problem of safety in nuclear-power engineering is one of 
the most acute now when Russia is marking the fortieth 
anniversary of its first nuclear power station. In the first 
six months of this year, sixteen incidents were reported at nine 
Russian nuclear power stations (down from nineteen in the same 
period last year). If the world average emergency protection 
incidents are to be viewed as a unit, Russia's index equals 
0.79. And although most of such incidents entails no 
irradiation or pollution of the environment, and the number of 
incidents is decreasing from year to year, researchers and 
engineers are far from resting on their laurels. 
  Disruptions are unavoidable in principle in the operation of 
nuclear power stations, as in any technical system. This is why 
the main task is to minimise their effects. It is simply 
impossible to give up nuclear power engineering. The 29 nuclear 
power units in Russia provide approximately 13 per cent of all 
the electric energy consumed in the country, its share being 25 
per cent in central Russia, more than forty per cent in 
north-western Russia and up to 70 per cent in the Kola Peninsula. 
  Russia is now carrying out a set of measures to ensure 
greater safety of its nuclear power plants. Many of them are 
being modernised, new equipment is being installed, including 
simulators to upgrade the skills of the operators. 
  At the beginning of the twenty-first century many units 
which 
will have exhausted their resource by then will have to be shut 
down and dismantled. This refers first of all to the Leningrad 
and Kursk power stations, where the Chernobyl-type reactors are 
being used, and the Novovoronezh and Kola nuclear power 
stations, which use the water-water reactors. 
  Vice-President of the Rosenergoatom concern Yevgeniy 
Ignatenko said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that a new 
generation reactors will replace the old ones, including on fast 
neutrons. A special decision will have to be made every time, 
proceeding from the price of the reactor and its effectiveness.

Center--All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Technical 
Physics to Russian President B.N. Yeltsin under the "Nuclear 
Center Warns..." rubric: "Creators of Nuclear Weapons Have 
Passed to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA a Letter for the Russian 
President"] 
  [Text] Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich! 
  We employees of the Russian Federal Nuclear 
Center--All-Russia Scientific Research Institute of Technical 
Physics [RFNC-ARSRITP] are deeply concerned at the situation 
which has taken shape in the nuclear weapons complex. While 
conscious of the whole complexity of the economic situation in 
Russia, we are nevertheless forced to draw your attention to the 
inadmissibility of the current process of virtual destruction of 
such a unique project as our enterprise. 
  The RFNC-ARSRITP, one of two Russian federal nuclear 
centers, 
was formed in the city of Chelyabinsk-70 (now a closed 
administrative-territorial formation, Snezhinsk city, 
Chelyabinsk Oblast) in 1955. The past decades of peace and 
creative building in the life of our state have shown that 
active pursuit of nuclear weapons projects, including the years 
of work on creating appropriate nuclear weapon systems, is the 
most effective means of deterring any aggression. More than 50 
percent of the nuclear weapon systems now in our arsenal include 
nuclear charges developed at the RFNC-ARSRITP. 
  In recent years there has been a substantial change in the 
state authorities' attitude to the military-industrial complex 
as a whole, including the two federal nuclear centers. The 
RFNC-ARSRITP is currently being funded at such a low level that 
there is a real threat that work on the state defense order will 
cease, not to mention the development of conversion areas. At 
the same time three similar centers in the United States are 
continuing to function at the former level -- they are 
recognized as the country's national asset. 
  Constantly inadequate and late funding has brought the 
RFNC-ARSRITP to crisis point. The enterprise's debts run into 
tens of billions of rubles and are increasing, owing inter alia 
to enforced expenditure on paying fines and credits. 
  The equipment is aging physically, and there is a 
catastrophic shortage of materials, tools, and special clothing; 
energy suppliers have repeatedly warned that they will cease 
supplying gas and electricity. As a consequence, there is a 
growing risk that emergency situations will arise, even 
involving technologically dangerous production sections. 
  Systematic delays over paying wages to employees over the 
past two and a half years are creating a very complex, 
physically and morally difficult social situation in the labor 
collective. People simply do not have the wherewithal to live 
or to feed their children. In such a psychological state they 
have to work under particularly harmful and dangerous conditions 
-- which can have grave consequences. 
  An extremely complex situation is also occurring in the 
social sphere. Medicine ekes out a pitiful existence, the birth 
rate has fallen, and the level of sickness and mortality has 
increased. There are no funds to improve the health of working 
people and their children. Housing construction has virtually 
stopped, the number of needy people is growing, and there are 
families with three children living in a hostel. The subsidiary 
agricultural enterprise has been forced to reduce the numbers of 
livestock and poultry, cannot supply the working people with 
food, and is essentially falling apart. 
  Concerned at the current processes and at the threatened 
loss of the technical and scientific potential which had been 
attained and which it will be impossible to restore, the 
leadership and the trade union committee of the RFNC-ARSRITP 
have repeatedly asked various state organs to examine questions 
of the enterprise's financial and economic position. There is a 
draft government decree on funding the federal nuclear centers 
which has been discussed repeatedly in the Ministry of Finance, 
the Ministry of the Economy, and the Ministry of Labor. But the 
majority of the labor collective's appeals have gone unanswered, 
and the draft decree remains just a draft. 
  We once again ask all state management bodies and you 
personally, Boris Nikolayevich, to consider our problems and to 
adopt corresponding decisions without delay, primarily on these 
questions: 
  approval of the Russian Federation Government decree on 
funding the federal nuclear centers; 
  repayment of debts and payment of delayed wages; 
  allocation of the necessary funds for housing construction, 
medicine, and other areas of the social sphere. 
  We are sure that Russia needs our labor, and we are ready to 
give our knowledge, strength, and experience in the name of our 
motherland's independence and might. We hope for wisdom and 
farsightedness from the president, the government, and Russia's 
other administrative bodies. 
  The appeal is signed by 7,369 employees of the RFNC-ARSRITP.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that 
his country's military doctrine is directed at no country. 
However, the country has its own national interest and an 
efficient army must defend them, General Grachev said. 
  He was speaking at Tula, a city southward of Moscow. 
Addressing cadets of the Military Artillery School, General 
Grachev said that Russia's Armed Forces would be reduced from 3 
million to 1.5 million men, but the forces would be more mobile 
and strong.

  [Text] Tula June 25 TASS -- The Russian Defence Ministry is 
doing all it can for keeping alive unique arms-manufacturing 
enterprises and to ensure their development in the future, 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said today at a 
graduation ceremony, held at the Tula Higher Artillery School, 
named after the Tula proletariat. 
  He stressed he wanted the Russian Armed Forces to be 
powerful 
and mobile, fitted with modern weapon systems and capable of 
ensuring Russia's security. According to Grachev, Russia's 
military doctrine does not regard any country as an enemy, but 
Russia has its own vital interests, which a strong and highly 
efficient army should protect. 
  Grachev praised the performance of the artillery school in 
training skilled military personnel. Today graduation diplomas 
were given to another 300 young lieutenants, who will put into 
effect the army reform. 
  The Russian defence minister had a meeting today with senior 
officials of Tula and the Tula region, as well as 
representatives of the regional union of industrialists and 
entrepreneurs, of which directors of arms-manufacturing 
enterprises make the backbone. He visited as well the arms 
museum and attended a ceremony of opening the day of the city.

<F P=106> [Article by Rita Naseniece: "Haritonovs and the Oil </F>
Business"] 
  [Excerpts] On 8 June the policemen from the 6th Division 
of the Police Department arrested three employees of the joint 
stock company TESS Petroleum (I do not mention their names on 
the investigator's request). The grounds for the arrest were 
documents found by the police after the arrest of Haritonovs, 
during a search that caused such discontent on the part of his 
lawyer. 
  The documents were discovered at various companies -- TESS 
AB, TESS Petroleum, Brih, ABB, and Amstrig. The investigation 
group is in possession of documents that prove that the company 
TESS Petroleum (which is a hundred percent Swedish TESS 
Petroleum's subsidiary in Latvia) has participated in illegal 
deals connected with the purchase and delivery of oil and oil 
products to Latvia. The essence of the deal was: the oil 
products were bought in Russia at cost, then sent supposedly to 
Kaliningrad, but in reality sold in Latvia, without paying 
customs duties. The geographic area of the illegal operations 
of the "oil syndicate" was rather large -- it included Estonia, 
Sweden, Finland, Russia (including the Kaliningrad region), and, 
of course, Latvia. 
  As the Police Department inspectors reported, the police now 
has documents proving the participation of 19 Russian 
oil-processing enterprises in the chain of deals. Among them, 
there are such gigantic oil-industry plants as Grozniy, 
Volgograd, and Jaroslavl oil refineries. The bosses of these 
plants, taking advantage of their position, sold the oil to TESS 
Petroleum at cost, instead of at world prices as should have 
been done when selling oil to Latvia. According to the documents 
in possession by the police, the amount TESS Petroleum has paid 
for the oil products supplied from Russia amounts to $28,603,176 
(in Russian currency, the sum is 22,882,541 Russian rubles). 
[passage omitted] 
  The deliveries were addressed to a recipient in Russia -- 
usually a company in the Kalinigrad Oblast, which as a rule 
refused to accept them. This way, the deliveries found their way 
to Latvia. 
  In the documents, discovered in the search, about 10 such 
Kaliningrad companies are mentioned, that have never received 
any of the deliveries allegedly sent to their address. In 
addition, this provided the opportunity to operate without a 
license for the purchase, securing additional profit. 
  At present, I do not have precise information as to what is 
the total consumption of any of the oil products, for example 
petrol, in Latvia, and what is the amount of their declared 
import. One of the experts on economic crimes from the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs is of the opinion that less than one 
hundredth of the imported petrol is being declared at the 
border. In the case of TESS Petroleum, petrol was purchased for 
10 cents (approximately 5.5 santims). As is known, in Riga 
petrol is being sold for 17 - 19 santims. 
  The profit came from unpaid customs duties. As was explained 
by our customs officers, for every liter of petrol one has to 
pay 4 santims in excise tax, and from the total amount an 
additional 18 percent state tax is to be paid. 
  The customs papers were sealed with forged stamps, and the 
signatures were also forged. As a result, Latvia has lost 
millions that have omitted the Treasury. 
  Now a little background about the "family tree". TESS 
Petroleum is a company established two years ago. Its initial 
capital has come entirely from TESS AB -- a Swedish company 
(please do not mistake it for the Latvian TESS AB). The 
president of the TESS Petroleum is Patricia Korotejeva, the 
widow of Rustem Kadirovs' brother. Mr. Kadirovs, a former 
inhabitant of Riga, currently a Swedish citizen, is the founder 
and co-owner -- along with Magnus Visland -- of the Swedish TESS 
AB. The task of TESS Petroleum in this oil business was to 
control the movement of freight-cars loaded with oil on their 
way from Russia to Latvia. The currency payments were conducted 
through an Estonian bank. TESS AB is also the founder of 
another Latvian company -- TES AB. On the list of its founders 
is -- together with the Swedish company with its 80 shares of 
capital -- also Ivans Haritonovs (40 shares), Grigoriy Bobovich, 
and Boris Yelisejev (40 shares each). In the company "Brih," 
the names of the founders are to be seen in a different 
combination, but they are the same -- they include Bobovich, 
Haritonovs, and the Swedish citizen Visland as well. Grigoriy 
Bobovich, a rather little known and quiet person, is at the same 
time the president of TESS AB. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, 25 Jun -- Lithuania's foreign policy 
blueprint, the forthcoming Riga meeting between the heads of the 
Baltic states and the U.S. President on 6 July, the progress of 
the talks with the CIS, and the recently formulated draft law on 
the diplomatic service were discussed in the Seimas on Friday at 
a session of the coordinating council on foreign affairs. Its 
head is Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. 
  According to a report from the republic's media, 
presidential 
adviser Justas Paleckis told journalists that Lithuania's 
foreign policy blueprint has been drawn up and will shortly be 
submitted for discussion by the members of the Seimas. 
"Lithuania must more actively integrate itself into West 
European economic, political, and military structures, while 
maintaining good relations with all countries in the world, and 
primarily with its neighbors, purposefully play the part of an 
East-West `bridge' and become a country of international 
transit. That is, perhaps, the essence of Lithuania's foreign 
policy blueprint," he stated. 
  It was also noted at the session that, at the meeting with 
the U.S. President, it will be necessary to seek a reinforcement 
of the moral support for independence by economic and social 
measures, by attracting U.S. investment and also through 
cooperation in the economic and scientific domain.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Russia's enrollment in the 
Partnership for Peace program is an important step indicating 
the country's determination to participate in the European 
cooperation process as an equal partner, says Lithuanian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Albinas Januska. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed NATO's 
cooperation plan in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in Brussels Wednesday [22 June]. 
  In an interview with BNS, Januska also emphasized the 
significance of other accords between Russia and NATO, which 
will create "clear and stable relations, enhance stability and 
security in Europe." 
  The Lithuanian official said a separate political agreement 
between Russia and the alliance proves that Partnership for 
Peace cannot resolve all problems hindering stability in Europe, 
but is only a part of a possibly much wider strategy. 
  "It is evident in this context that certain consultations 
between NATO and Russia, carried out beyond the partnership 
framework, concerning nuclear arms, their control, problems of 
mutual disarmament, restrictions on deployment of troops and hot 
lines for cases of potential conflicts, are understandable in 
creating an atmosphere of trust in Europe," the deputy minister 
said. 
  In Januska's words, Lithuania may also be interested to 
develop a program for wider cooperation with NATO. Considering 
Lithuania's determination to become a fully-fledged member of 
the alliance, and how Lithuania's individual needs to cooperate 
with NATO will be evaluated, possibilities of a wider accord 
between Lithuania and NATO could be discussed, at the same time 
expanding practical cooperation within the partnership program, 
Januska said. 
  Hopefully, the deputy minister said, a role in building 
European security will be given not only to big, important and 
well-armed countries, but also to nations, which found 
themselves in an uncertain security situation not through their 
own fault.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Lithuania's national 
currency the litas became quite strong during the year that 
passed since its introduction, and such stability must be 
preserved, say the present and previous leaders of the 
Lithuanian central bank. 
  The litas was introduced June 25, 1993 when the central bank 
was headed by Romualdas Visokavicius. He told reporters Friday 
that the introduction of Lithuanian national currency was 
praised by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
In Visokavicius' view, the Currency Board, which was set up 
after the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar, will not survive 
long. 
  Meanwhile, the bank's current head, Kazys Ratkevicius, 
maintains that the Currency Board, whose task is to preserve a 
stabile litas- dollar rate, is very useful to the country's 
monetary policy. But both Ratkevicius and Visokavicius noted 
that tying the litas to Western hard currency is not enough for 
the economy to start recovering. Lithuania's industry and gross 
domestic product must be aimed at Western standards, as well, 
Visokavicius said. 
  In Ratkevicius' view, an important factor helping to 
preserve 
a stabile litas are the central bank's receipts in hard 
currency. The chief banker said the bank purchased around 60 
million U.S. dollars over the past three months. 
  Ratkevicius also informed reporters that 500 and 1,000 lit 
bills have already been printed, but there is no need to release 
them into circulation yet.

  [Text] Yerevan [dateline as received] -- Iranian market has 
become the principal consumer of Armenian machinery. Last year, 
over 90 percent of machine export went to Iran, for a sum 
totalling nearly half-million dollars. As told the head of 
machine-production Administration in the Armenian Industrial 
Ministry, Vardgues Majaryan, appearance at the Iranian market 
has saved many machine- building plants in Armenia from 
bankruptcy, since the CIS market, due to blockade and transport 
problems, has become inaccessible. During the whole last year 
only 70 machines were exported to CIS countries. However, as 
thinks Majaryan, the relatively high demand for Armenian 
machines in Iran is not an escape from the hard situation in 
which the industry has found itself. The thing is that Iranian 
market has purely consumptional and mediatory character, rather 
than industrial purposes. Thus the milling engine, which costs 
4 to 5 thousand dollars, is sold to Iran at a half-price. As 
thinks the head administrator, the production of heavy machines 
in Armenia is not justified, since their sale is difficult. The 
machine building industry passes today to the output of small 
universal machines, the demand for which is rather high.

  [Text] Yerevan ("GOLOS ARMENII" Daily-Past), 06/25/94 -- 
It's hard to say for sure, what is the current situation 
regarding the construction of an Iran-Armenia gas pipe-line, 
though official discussions in this regard were being carried 
for several years. The information from official sources is 
quite contradictory. 
  According to RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press 
service, the matter is getting no further than negotiations, and 
representatives of both sides continue discussion of 
construction details. 
  At the same time, RA Ministry of Fuel and Energy reported 
that the negotiations have been finished, and projecting work is 
currently being done.

  [Text] Members of the Russian Federation Council decided to 
appeal to the Constitutional Court with a request to examine the 
anti-crime decree issued by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  A total of 64 deputies (36 percent of the total number) 
voted 
for this decision. In accordance with provision 125 of the 
Constitution, at least one fifth of the Federation Council 
deputies must back an appeal to the Constitutional Court. 
  The appeal was initiated by deputies Aleksandr Belyayev, 
Yuriy Boldyrev and Aleksey Manannikov. 
  Belyayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that the 
Constitutional Court could consider the appeal this autumn after 
the State Duma adopted the law on Constitutional Court at second 
reading.

  [Text] The Federation Council approved Friday changes and 
amendments of the Russian Criminal and Criminal Proceedings 
Codes. 
  Nearly 40 articles of the former and nine of the latter were 
amended. At the same time 19 Criminal Code articles were 
annulled and 15 new ones included. 
  The Council's Constitutional Legislation and Legality 
Committee issued a statement saying that among important new 
articles were 17 on crimes committed by a conspiring group of 
people or by an organized group and 213 (3) on terrorism that 
were aimed at combatting organized crime. Article 13 on 
necessary defense was revised. The notions of socialist and 
personal properties were removed. 
  The committee said that some changes and amendments of the 
Criminal Code were fundamental in that they had a bearing on the 
main institutions of criminal law and would enhance the 
suppression of crime. 
  Also Friday the Federation Council passed without debate a 
bill adopted by the State Duma on foreign borrowings and credits 
granted by the Russian Federations.

  [Text] Speaker of the Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko 
says he voted in favor of the government-proposed budget for 
1994. Speaking in Moscow, he said his decision came after the 
Council had pushed through new articles to the budget relating 
to government spending on the armed forces. 
  Article 32 now provides for an extra budgetary fund of 
support to the army to be raised as part of government revenues 
from privatization. The resources are to be channelled to 
provide social security nets to the servicemen including housing 
construction and conversion of defense-related industries. 
  One other article binds the government to bring down the 
cost 
of this year's defense spending by offering contracts to men and 
non-commissioned officers and hiring officers in reserve, 
reducing the number of military schools and disbanding 
understaffed contingents. 
  The budget now provides for 40.6 trillion rubles of defense 
spending in 1994. 
  However, the Council did not adopt any resolution on 
Shumeyko's report about FC's role and place in overcoming 
critical trends in the country. The question will be discussed 
as the Council meets again next month.

  [Text] Members of the leading Russia's Choice (RC) 
parliamentary faction have thrown weight behind the government- 
proposed budget after rejecting it in the three previous rounds 
of voting. RC leader Yegor Gaydar said his faction was led by 
two main reasons in reversing its decision. On the one hand, 
any attempt to try to improve the budget by the present 
parliament would be hopeless. On the other, the RC did not want 
any political gambling by the Liberal Democrats over the budget. 
  Gaydar described the proposed budget as totally unrealistic 
with its revenue and expenditure parts being far too high. In 
his view, the paper reflects the existing balance of forces in 
the State Duma following last December's election and a strong 
pressure by sectorial lobby groups in parliament. 
  The RC leader said both administration and government 
representatives had appealed to his faction during a break in 
vote-taking and the RC "accepted their considerations, 
particularly those relating to LDP demands in exchange for their 
support". Gaydar denied having engaged in any horse trading on 
the issue.

  [Text] Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin said today it 
was premature to discuss the possibility early elections. 
Commenting on the proposal to extend the powers of the 
parliament and the president for a second term Rybkin said that 
first people should feel the economy is being stabilized and 
life improved as a result of actions taken by the Federal 
Assembly (parliament - IF) and the government. The proposal to 
extend the president's and parliament's powers was put forward 
by Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  Before leaving for Siberia and the Far East Rybkin answered 
questions during a press conference by phone organized by the 
Russian State Duma's press service and Interfax. 
  Rybkin said that the legislative process must be seen to be 
working. 
  He said if the work was properly carried out and the 
legislative bodies of at least two thirds of the federation's 
constituent members spoke for this, the chamber could discuss 
the postponement of elections. However, he added that it was 
unreasonable to speak on the postponement of elections in 
advance. 
  Rybkin stressed that during his trips across Russian regions 
voters kept saying they were tired of elections. 
  Commenting on the recommendation of the State Duma to 
suspend 
the president's anti-crime decree, Rybkin said the president had 
been asked not to enact the decree until a resolution on its 
implementation is adopted. Rybkin stressed that the decree was 
not simple and that its basic idea -- the fight against crime -- 
could not be rejected. 
  Rybkin said he was sure that the decree would soon become 
law. He repeated that the State Duma had decided to set up a 
working group in order to draft the appropriate law with the 
participation of representatives of the president, the 
government, the Interior Ministry and the prosecutor's office. 
  When asked his opinion on proposals to declare direct 
presidential rule in the country, Rybkin said he doubted that 
Boris Yeltsin would introduce it and that the whole concept was 
inadmissible in a country trying to establish the rule of law.

  [Text] The State Duma group of Yegor Gaydar's Russia's 
Choice rejected proposals that the term of the Federal Assembly 
be extended. It insisted on holding parliamentary and 
presidential elections as specified by the constitution. 
  In its statement made public in the Duma Friday the group 
said that its members could not agree with the proposal made by 
Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  The statement said that Russia's Choice was giving priority 
to legality and morality over political expediency. It cast 
doubt on the desirability of what Shumeyko had proposed. The 
Russia's Choice group considers that instead of consolidating 
political stability it would destroy the weak saplings of civic 
accord, trust between political groupings and respect for the 
law that had emerged in Russian society recently. 
  The group is not convinced by Shumeyko's argument that the 
extension of the terms would save much funds. It states that 
society had paid dearly for every short cut of democratic 
procedures. What is more, it would be members of parliament who 
would make a decision on extending their own terms, which would 
place them in a delicate moral position.

  [Text] On Friday Russia's State Duma adopted a decree "On 
the Constitutional Court." As many as 331 deputies voted for 
this decree, five -- against, and 27 abstained from voting (as 
it is known, the RF Constitutional Court and members of the 
State Duma Committee on Legislation and Legal Reform submitted 
this bill for consideration). The procedure of filling 
Constitutional Court (CC) vacancies remains unchanged -- a CC 
judge is appointed by the Federation Council following the 
president's nomination. 
  Given its authorities the CC hears trials on correspondence 
with federal laws, normative acts of the Russian president and 
of both chambers of the Federal Assembly, of Russian government, 
Constitutions of the republics, charters and laws of the RF 
constituent members to the RF Constitution. The court can also 
determine the congruence with the Constitution and treaties made 
between state bodies of power of the Russian Federation and 
state bodies of power of the RF constituent members, and 
agreements between state bodies of the RF constituent members. 
  It is within the Court's competence to determine the 
congruence with the Constitution of the international agreements 
of the Russian Federation which are not in force yet, to 
interpret the RF Constitution, to make conclusions about the 
observance of the procedure of accusations against the Russian 
president of high treason or of committing any serious crime. 
The CC has the right to initiate legislative actions on issue 
which are in its competence. 
  Any citizens of the Russian Federation who is over 40, has 
an 
excellent reputation and higher juridical education and 
experience of juridical work of no less than 15 years can be 
appointed to the post of a judge on the CC. 
  The decree stipulates that powers of a CC judge can be 
suspended if the CC agrees to arrest him or to bring charges 
against him or if he is unable to fulfill his duties due to the 
state of his health. 
  The mandate of a judge in the CC can be taken away if the 
rules on his appointment were violated. 
  The same measure is taken if a judge looses citizenship of 
the Russian Federation or if he is sentenced or if the judge 
continues to behave incompatible with his post despite warnings 
on the part of the RF Constitutional Court. 
  The decree foresees that the chairman of the CC is elected 
at 
its plenary sitting by a secret voting by the majority of 
judges. Chairman of the Court, his deputy, and judge-secretary 
are elected for three years.

<F P=106> [Boris Boyko report: "LDPR Tries To Straighten Things Out </F>
With the Privatizers"] 
  [Text] After adopting the budget, the State Duma at its 
session yesterday undertook an energetic, although abortive, 
attempt to suspend post-voucher privatization. A response from 
the government -- a final approval of a corresponding program -- 
is to come today. 
  It seems that when he first addressed the State Duma, 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, in response to appeals by Anatoliy 
Chubays to observe the time limit, let drop the phrase: "Mr. 
Chubays, you will be watching the clock in Lefortovo! [prison]" 
Yesterday's session confirmed the seriousness of the LDPR 
[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader's intentions. 
  The LDPR faction submitted to the Duma a bill with a 
"telltale" name: "On Suspending the Process of Privatization in 
Russia as of 1 July 1994 Pending Examination of the Results of 
Voucher Privatization and Approval by the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly of a Concept and a State Program for 
Post-Voucher Privatization." The Duma Council at its session 
did not approve this move. The Council decided to find a 
compromise and confine itself to an appeal to the president and 
the prime minister. The draft appeal, submitted by 
Privatization Committee Chairman Sergey Burkov, is effectively a 
warning. It says that owing to lack of guarantees of ownership 
rights for owners of former state property, the Duma will be 
forced to suspend the law On Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises. Responsibility for this lies "with those 
state officials who have failed to create a legal foundation for 
this process." The appeal was not supported by the deputies. 
  Then Zhirinovskiy, stating that "behind each instance of 
privatization there is a crime," demanded that the bill drafted 
by his faction be passed immediately. It was supported by 194 
deputies (226 votes were needed to pass it). As a result, "the 
matter will be finalized" in the privatization and economic 
policy committees. 
  It's now the government's turn. Sings are that the 
post-voucher privatization program will be considered today. It 
remains unclear, however, whether this program will be presented 
to the Federal Assembly. On the one hand, until now Anatoliy 
Chubays has insisted that the post-voucher program be enacted by 
a presidential edict. His position is understandable: First, 
there is little time, to put it mildly, for normal consideration 
in parliament, and second, the Duma's intentions to punish 
embezzlers and corrupt officials speak for themselves. On the 
other hand, the State Duma's warning is serious enough. 
Moreover, there is nothing to prevent the LDPR from regularly 
moving its bill, which will hang like a sword of Damocles over 
the government. In these conditions the likelihood of the 
post-voucher privatization program's being presented to the 
Federal Assembly increases. If this happens, Chubays will 
apparently have nothing left to do but follow the fate of the 
voucher and resign. While he found it possible to avoid this 
move when the president ordered him to leave Moscow 
privatization to Luzhkov, discussion in the Duma will have more 
far-reaching consequences.

  [Text] Moscow, 24 Jun -- The State Duma has decided to meet 
in plenary session three times a week during the time remaining 
to the parliamentary recess. Until now it has been holding two 
plenary sessions a week -- on Wednesdays and Fridays. 
  Communist Deputy Igor Bratishchev, who put forward the 
proposal for an additional sitting, noted the Duma had a lot of 
work to complete before deputies went off on their holidays. He 
observed that many deputies were neglecting their duties by not 
attending the Duma regularly. As an example, he cited his 
political opponents in the Russia's Choice group. He claimed 
that "30 percent of Yegor Gaydar's supporters do not turn up for 
plenary sessions."

resolution of the Karabakh conflict, we noted with satisfaction 
that the cease-fire called for on 12 May through the Russian 
mediation and CSCE's support is generally being observed. The 
cease-fire agreement that has been ratified with the signatures 
of the defense ministers and army commanders is an essential 
factor for ending the dispute. However, we express our 
uneasiness at the human loss and material damage recently caused 
by several clashes on the Armenian-Azerbaijan border. We regard 
any attempt to violate the cease-fire as dangerous. 
  Within the framework of our joint efforts, we call on all 
the 
sides to adhere to the following in order to end the conflict: 
  1. The sides should demonstrate in words and deeds their 
loyalty to the obligations they have undertaken in signing the 
cease-fire agreement. 
  2. The sides should avoid any hostile activity that may 
undermine the atmosphere of confidence, which is being created. 
  3. The sides should take adequate [preceding word in 
English] measures to peacefully resolve and remove the existing 
disputes. 
  4. With a view of signing a political agreement to end the 
armed conflict and in order to further activate the peace 
process, the sides should resolutely take advantage of the 
existing peaceful situation. They should make a strenuous 
effort to put into effect the clear demand for an end to the 
bloody conflict between the people and the solution of all the 
contentious issues at the negotiating table.

  [Text] On 20 June, Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE Minsk 
Group, and Vladimir Kazimirov, President Boris Yeltsin's special 
envoy, conveyed a joint letter to President Geydar Aliyev, 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, and the head of the Armenian 
community in Daghlyk Karabakh on the need for the consolidation 
of the cease-fire agreement in the region. An AZERTAC 
correspondent has asked Vefa Gulizade, state adviser on foreign 
policy affairs, to comment on the letter. He said the following: 
  I wish to stress that the letter is the initial outcome of 
the effective cooperation between the CSCE and the Russian 
Federation. Jan Eliasson held talks with [name and title 
indistinct], First Deputy Foreign Minister Adamishin [name as 
heard], and Vladimir Kazimirov in Moscow during the past few 
days. The need to find a peaceful solution to the dispute 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan within the CSCE framework was 
emphasized. The representatives of the nine CSCE Minsk Group 
members will meet in Vienna on 7 July. Vladimir Kazimirov will 
also attend that meeting. The most important point in the 
letter is the call to the disputing sides to take advantage of 
the cease-fire and sign a political agreement to completely end 
the bloody confrontation and move to resolve all the problems 
through talks.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abudllayeva and Viktor </F>
Shulman] 
  [Text] Baku June 26 TASS -- It is critical to retain what 
has been already achieved in the negotiating process by 
concentrating efforts of all interested parties, including 
Russia and the CSCE, upon a full-scale agreement on 
Azeri-Armenian settlement, according to the Russian president's 
special envoy for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov. 
  On Saturday night, Ambassador-at-Large Kazimirov arrived in 
the Azeri capital Baku to discuss some political aspects of the 
Karabakh settlement. 
  On Sunday, Russia's special envoy met Azeri President Heydar 
Aliyev. During the meeting, he reported, in particular, about 
the consultations held in Moscow earlier this week by head of 
the CSCE Minsk group for Nagorno-Karabakh Jan Eliasson, who also 
met with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Russian Parliament's 
upper house and chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, 
and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin. 
In the course of these meetings, the participants discussed 
problems related to the Karabakh settlement. 
  Kazimirov stressed the need for pooling efforts of all 
concerned parties in strenthening the regime of the cease-fire 
agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This issue is to be 
considered at the forthcoming meeting in Vienna with the 
participation of the conflicting sides and mediators. In 
accordance with preliminary agreement with the Misnk group 
chief, the meeting is scheduled for early July and thus will 
coincide in time with a meeting of the CSCE Interparliamentary 
Assembly. The Armenian and Azeri parliament chairmen are likely 
to be invited to this meeting. 
  The Azeri president agreed that the pooling of efforts by 
the 
conflicting parties, and CSCE, Russian and CIS mediators, as 
well as of neighbouring countries was critical to the 
peace-making process. He believes that to achieve a durable 
peace in the region, it is necessary to liberate the occupied 
Azeri lands, to create conditions for refugees to return to 
places of their permanent residence, to restore communications 
between the two warring republics and to provide security 
guarantees for ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh 
enclave. 
  For this purpose, Aliyev stressed, "we are ready to work in 
close contact with the CSCE, Russia and other mediators". He 
also assured Kazimirov that "Azerbaijan is not seeking to use 
the respite in hostilities for developing muscles, inventing 
accusations of the other side, conducting politcal manoeuvres 
and fuelling a propaganda campaign". 
  After his consultations in Baku, Kazimirov is planning to 
visit the Armenian capital, according to some sources. He is 
expected to leave for Yerevan on Sunday night or on Monday 
morning, the same sources reported.

  [Text] President Geydar Aliyev received Vladimir Kazimirov, 
President Yeltsin's competent envoy on the Daghlyk Karabakh 
problem, today. Aliyev and Kazimirov agreed that the cease-fire 
is not being heeded in the western areas and that the existing 
situation requires that the principles must be consolidated so 
that a peaceful solution can be found to end the war. 
  Vladimir Kazimirov briefed Geydar Aliyev on CSCE Minsk Group 
Chairman Jan Eliasson's visit to Moscow and his talks with 
Vladimir [name indistinct], chairman of the Russian Federation 
[word indistinct] and chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary 
Assembly, and Deputy Foreign Minister Adamyshin. He said that 
the main issue that was discussed was the question of finding a 
peaceful solution to resolve the dispute between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. He noted that the outcome of the talks indicated 
that Russia and the CSCE maintained a similar approach. In view 
of that, the sides must benefit from the political experience 
and positions of Russia and the CSCE. 
  President Aliyev said that he highly assesses the talks Jan 
Eliasson has held with the political circles in Russia. He 
described the general agreement reached between the 
representatives of the CSCE and Russia as a concrete step in the 
effort to find a peaceful solution to the war. 
  Later, the sides discussed the possibility of benefiting 
from 
the experience of the Middle East countries and Turkey, which 
are neighbors with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Geydar Aliyev noted 
that the participation of the representatives of Iran and Turkey 
in the effort to find a political solution to the problem is 
essential. He also said that holding political consultations 
with them is equally important. 
  State Adviser Vefa Gulizade and Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov attended the meeting.

  [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov, President Yeltsin's special 
envoy to Nagorno-Karabakh, who is conducting shuttle diplomacy 
to solve the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict, arrived in Baku 
again last night. He was received by President Geydar Aliyev 
this morning. Kazimirov said Russia believes the active 
participation of Turkey and Iran in the efforts to resolve the 
Nagorno-Karabakh problem would be beneficial. He explained that 
he went to Tehran to hold talks with this aim and that Iran 
agreed to the proposal in principle. Kazimirov said he will soon 
go to Ankara with the same proposal. 
  Aliyev said he finds the proposal favorable. He said he 
supports the current developments, which started with a 
cease-fire and continued with a letter sent to the leaders of 
the sides concerned. The active participation of Turkey and 
Iran, Aliyev said, might make a solution easier. 
  Aliyev pointed out that Turkey is a member both of the CSCE 
and of the Minsk Group. In this respect, he said, we attach 
great importance to the participation of Turkey in particular.

  [Text] Baku, June 25, IRNA -- Interior Minister of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan Ramil Usubov Friday called for an 
agreement with Iran on extradition of offenders and cooperation 
in campaign against drug traffickers. 
  He made the call in a meeting with Iranian Ambassador to 
Baku 
'Ali Akbar Nehavandian. 
  The ambassador touched on the escalation of perpetration of 
crimes against Iranians in the republic and called on the 
relevant officials to pursue the case. Nahavandian did not 
dismiss possibility of links between the crimes and the 
forthcoming visit to Iran of President Geydar Aliyev and 
stressed that no doubt such criminal acts were carried out by 
certain power sources to prevent boosting of mutual ties. 
President Aliyev is to leave for Iran next week. 
  Pointing to the unrestricted entry of people to both the 
countries, Usubov warned against infiltration of certain 
elements affiliated to sabotage groups. He regretted deplorable 
happenings for Iranians in Azerbaijan and said that necessary 
instructions had been issued in order to decisively confront 
those involved in such incidents. The minister underlined the 
importance his country attaches to Iran and said Baku would not 
allow such crimes to be repeated in future. He said that 
Azerbaijan has recently signed an agreement with Turkey on 
extradition of offenders and in case a similar contract would be 
signed with Iran, runaway culprits would be arrested and 
extradited. 
  Some ten days ago the body of an Iranian national identified 
as Mohammad Seyyed was found at his residence here who had been 
murdered heinously. 
  Due to the follow up of the Iranian Embassy, the Azeri 
president ordered formation of an ad hoc committee by the 
interior minister to probe into crimes against Iranians in that 
republic. However the Azeri media did not give coverage to the 
murder of the Iranian national.

  [Text] Baku (June 23) TURAN: Today the press service of 
Nakhichevan's Supreme Mejlis issued a statement which reads that 
having violated the truce agreement, Armenian troops launched an 
attack towards the villages of Yukhary and Ashagy Buzgov in the 
Babek region on June 18 and on June 19-20 towards the Sadarak 
Region of Nakhichevan. 
  Earlier on May 28 Armenian troops attacked the village of 
Gunnet in the Sadarak Region and moved 1 kilometre further into 
Nakhichevani territory. Armenians seized several strategically 
important hills and shelled the region centre of Sadarak. As a 
result five Azeri soldiers have been wounded and several 
housings have been damaged. 
  However, after that attack the representatives of Armenia 
and 
Nakhichevan reached the agreement banning escalation of tension 
on the border. Resumption of aggressive activities shows that 
Armenia's authorities ignore the efforts by the international 
organizations aimed at restoration peace in the region. 
  The press service of Supreme Mejlis of Nakhichevan calls on 
the world community to exert pressure in the Republic of Armenia 
to stop its aggression against Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.

  [Text] Baku, June 24 (TURAN)--Ibragim Ibragimli, first 
deputy of Azerbaijan Popular Front (APF) told at today's 
press-conference that a year ago, by transformation of Abulfaz 
Elchibey's authorities of President to Head of Supreme Council 
Geydar Aliyev, the Milli Mejlis legalized coup d'etat made by 
Suret Huseynov on June 4, 1993. 
  According to Ibragimli, the situation in the country for the 
past period became more complicated and the country is on the 
edge of social explosion. He noted that the opposition 
submitted to leadership a pact of anticrisis proposals, but has 
not received an answer yet. "Leadership reinforced repressions 
against opposition", said he. 
  Ali Kerimov, APF deputy for political issues noted that one 
of the reasons of coup d'etat in the republic was a fraud of the 
public. "An opinion, that if Geydar Aliyev comes to power, all 
the problems in the country will be settled, was formed prior to 
the coup d'etat, that is why the attitude of public to such 
change of power was quite indifferent" said he. 
  According to Kerimov, over the past year, Azerbaijan on many 
positions was trown back, due to that political and economic 
life of Azerbaijan was damaged. "Azerbaijan's entering the CIS 
and joining the Agreement for collective security was the reason 
for location of foreign troops in the counrty, transformed state 
border of Azerbaijan into the border of CIS. And involvment of 
Russian company "Lucoil" to the unitised project for the 
development of offshore oil reserves means the owning by Russia 
the treasures, totalling several billion dollars", said Kerimov. 
  Kerimov noted that inconsistency and contradictoriness of 
foreign policy brought to the loss of West's support in peaceful 
settlement of Armenian-Azeri conflict. "After the new 
leadership came to power, Azerbaijan had lost 20 percent of its 
territories and more than million people became refugees", he 
noted. 
  According to Kerimov, loss of professionalism in the 
government brought the country to economic chaos; corruption and 
bribery increased greately. "Present hard situation is not the 
result of economic reforms, they have not begun in Azerbaijan 
yet. It is the result of slovenliness and nonprofessionalism", 
said Kerimov. 
  Kerimov said that Azerbaijan will not take part in the 
demonstration, scheduled for June 25 by the Alliance of National 
and Democratic Forces. According to him, the social and 
economic situation in the country is so hard and tensitive that 
there are a lot of facts which can drive the population and 
separare groups to participate in the demonstration.

Central Bloc during last month. The party "Ana Veten" presided 
over in the Bloc during that period. Participants appreciated 
activity of Bloc. Current problems of the day were also 
discussed. 
  "Events which took place in Kusarskiy were not of national 
character. It was an error committed by leadership in national 
policy and in selection of personnel" , that was the unanimous 
opinion of the conference participants. 
  Fakhraddin Aydaev, head of party "National Equality" noted 
that national policy of leadership comes to denying the 
existence of national problem in Azerbaijan. Then he noted that 
there was not resistance between the Lezghins and Azeri people, 
but the Lezghins problem exists. 
  Answering to journalists concerning the involving of 
"Sadval" 
to the events in Kusarskiy, he said that "Sadval" learned about 
these events two days later and this organization played a 
positive role in the settlement of the incident. 
  Issue concerning a demonstration, scheduled by the National 
Democratic Alliance for tomorrow was discussed. The 
participants unanimously opposed the demonstration which can 
break the fragile stability in the republic.

  [Text] Baku [no dateline as received] -- An advisory 
committee headed by Geydar Aliyev had a session June 21 where 
present problems in Azerbaijan economy were discussed. 
  The President certified that, though the necessary measures 
were undertaken, the situation in economy is aggravated. Low 
prices for fuel at domestic market, as well as easy-terms 
credits played a destructive role in the social and economic 
sphere. 
  In this connection, positively were estimated the 
President's 
orders on quarterly revisions of prices for oil and petroleum 
products and on granting credits on easy terms. 
  Parliament Chairman Rasul Guliyev, appearing on the session, 
observed that despite the President's order "On Liberalization 
of Foreign Trade Prices", an enormous amount of goods in the 
state warehouses remain non-distributed. Thus the Agricultural 
Ministry has goods for $400m [million], State Oil Concern for 
$100m, and State Metal Concern from $15m to $20m. Total price 
of unsold goods is $600m. Every day products for a sum $5m to 
$6m turn unfit. 
  Mr. Guliyev proposed to organize a special advisory 
commission with powers to distribute the stored products in 6 
months period. 
  The session also discussed the issue of privatization of 
unfinished construction sites.

  [Text] Baku (June 23) TURAN: The State Committee for 
property submitted to Milli Mejlis Commissions for Economic 
Policy and for Budget Supervision new draft of Privatization 
Program. Discussion of the program was to take place three days 
ago, but was postponed. 
  TURAN was told by the source, close to government, that the 
main reason of that is due to three various approaches to 
privatization program. 
  The most influential representative of the first trend is 
the 
parliament's speaker Rasul Guliyev. He stands for mass 
privatization, as in Russia. Such approach is motivated by 
economic efficiency of such privatization. But supporters of 
such approach are widely represented in economic structures, as 
well as in authority structures. In case of mass sale of state 
property they will become owners of great properties. 
  Supporters of this approach oppose the monopoly of State 
Committee for Property concerning privatization questions. 
  Representative of the second approach is Prime Minister 
Suret 
Guseynov. He opposes privatization, referring to continuous 
war. But such approach is also explained by the fact, that his 
supporters are weakly represented in industry, and for them 
privatization would mean loss of positions. 
  The third approach is reflect in the privatization program 
and is protected by State Committee for Property. That approach 
provides gradual and stage by stage privatization -- in 
1994-1995 privatization of minor enterprises, and beginning from 
1996 -- privatization of average enterprises and large 
enterprises partially. 
  In this case social justice is emphasised, and economic 
efficiency is on the second place. Such option of the Program 
of State Committee for Property was ready a year and a half ago, 
when Elchibey was in power.

  [Text] Sukhumi June 24 TASS -- Russian peace-making troops 
reached today the Georgian-Abkhazian confrontation line after a 
many-kilometer march and started to protect posts and patrol the 
safety zone along the Inguri river. The zone is 44 kilometers 
long and 24 kilometers wide, head of the press center of the 
peace-making troops in Abkhazia Vitaliy Gerasimov told ITAR-TASS 
today. 
  Routes and helicopter pads have been prepared by an 
engineering unit in accordance with the schedule of 
peace-makers' introduction. Two ammunition storages have been 
revealed on the Gali-Zugdidi line during works in the 
rain-washed ground. One of the storages contained 40 boxes with 
shells, the other -- 600 mines. They are being rendered 
harmless. 
  According to Gerasimov, the troops were located in the area 
without any incidents. The Russian servicemen are staying at 
two check points protecting the bridge to the north of Inguri 
and at 18 control-observer posts. There are five check points 
and ten posts in the south. All in all, there are four mobile 
groups in the safety zone. 
  The main goal of the peace-makers is to clear the zone of 
various weapons, including fire arms and guns, said Gerasimov. 
An area of materiel concentration is being formed in Ochamchira 
and Akhuti. 
  The population took the troops arrival with understanding 
and 
well-wishing feelings. They hope that the six-months-long 
mission of Russian servicemen in Abkhazia will help to restore 
peace in Abkhazia.

  [Text] A curfew has been introduced in the 12-kilometer 
security zone along the Inguri river. 
  The command of the Russian peacekeeping forces took this 
decision. An address to the population broadcast on Abkhaz 
television says that the curfew will be in force from 21:00 till 
6:00 in the security zone covering 12 kilometers along both 
banks of the Inguri river. 
  All people who have arms (except the state management 
bodies) 
must give them over to local power bodies. Charges will be 
brought against those who disobey this order. 
  All armed people in the security zone except the state 
management bodies will be detained and cars will be inspected. 
Peacekeepers are allowed to use arms in case of violation of 
this order. 
  Headquarters of the Russian peacekeeping forces in the zone 
of the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict warned that if there were 
attacks against detachments and servicemen of the peacekeeping 
forces they could "open fire without warning." 
  On Friday two Russian motor rifle battalions came to Zugdidi 
(western Georgia) from Batumi. Air landing detachments will 
arrive in Abkhazia's Gali region the same day. 
  Russia's deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, private 
envoy of the Russian president, also arrived in Abkhazia 
Friday. He plans to meet with chairman of Abkhazia's 
parliament Vladislav Ardzinba. During this meeting they will 
discuss the course of the peacemaking operation and several 
issues related to the upcoming Georgian-Abkhaz negotiations 
scheduled for June 30 in Geneva.

  [Text] Sukhumi, 27 Jun -- The deployment of Russian 
peacekeeping forces along the line of Georgian-Abkhaz 
confrontation has been completed. The Russian military 
contingent deployed in the security area on either side of the 
Inguri river at an equal distance of 12 km is estimated to 
number 2,500 men. Izida Chanin, head of the information section 
at the Abkhaz Information and Press Ministry told an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent today that 1,400 Russian paratroopers are serving 
on Abkhaz territory. 
  In her words, the paratroopers are guarding the most vital 
facilities in Galskiy Rayon, including a hydroelectric power 
station on the Inguri river. A tough curfew is in force in the 
area, and the areas in which the peacekeepers are deployed are 
patrolled on the ground and from the air. 
  The Abkhaz authorities say that the deployment of the 
peacekeeping forces proceeded without incident, with not a 
single post coming under fire. The Abkhaz Information and Press 
Ministry reports that this assessment coincides with the view of 
the joint command headquarters of the group of Russian 
peacekeeping forces. The peacekeeping forces are expected to be 
deployed at all checkpoints and control and observation posts by 
29 June, and by 30 June the remaining Georgian armed formations 
are to be withdrawn from the Kodori Gorge to areas outside 
Abkhazia under the supervision of UN representatives.

  [Text] Georgian Deputy Prime Minister Tamaz Nadareishvili 
told Interfax Sunday that as the peacekeeping operation was 
getting underway, Georgian guerilla units were being withdrawn 
from the Abkhazian bank of the Inguri River, in particular the 
Kodor canyon and the Gali, Ochamchira and Sukhumi districts. 
  June 26 is the day when the operation officially started in 
the Georgian-Abkhazian war zone. Russian paratrooper and 
motorized infantry units, trained for peacekeeping operations, 
are taking positions on both banks of the Inguri. Mine clearing 
has started and a bridge on the river is being repaired which 
will hopefully enable Georgian refugees to return to their home 
in Abkhazia. 
  Nadareishvili said that nearly 30,000 refugees had returned 
to the Gali District. The local authorities made jobs, bread 
and sugar available to them. Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of 
the Abkhazian parliament who visited the area three days ago and 
talked to its residents, did not rule out the possibility of 
setting up local government made up of Georgians. 
  Nadareishvili admitted that the return of refugees to the 
Gali District would probably take 12 to 18 months. 
  He said that Georgian could hardly be able to maintain its 
territorial integrity as long as the Abkhazians dictate their 
own terms.

  [Text] Sochi June 23 TASS -- Abkhazia conditioned on Friday 
the beginning of repair works at two major bridges over the 
border river of Inguri on firm guarantees that they would not be 
used by Georgia for combat purposes. 
  Deputy Premier Enver Kapba, the chief Abkhazian negotiator 
at 
the current talks with Georgia, told ITAR-TASS that all repair 
works at the motor bridge will start only after Russian 
peacekeepers are deployed to separate the conflicting parties. 
  "As far as the railway bridge is concerned, (Abkhazia) will 
start repair works only when the problem of its political status 
is settled," Kapba stressed. 
  The deputy premier told TASS that Abkhazia had handed over 
to 
the Georgian side a list of valuables removed from the Abkhazian 
territory during the war. The list included aircraft, sea 
vessels, motor vehicles, factory equipment and museum rarities 
among other things. 
  "To continue our dialogue, it is essential that the Georgian 
side reimburse at least a part of that damage," Kapba said.

  [Text] An Armenian parliamentary delegation headed by 
Deputy Speaker Aram Saakyan arrived in Tbilisi today. The 
delegation had a meeting with Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman 
of the Georgian Supreme Council and head of state. The 
conversation dealt with fruitfully developing relations between 
Armenia and Georgia. 
  Problems common for the two countries have been considered. 
In particular, the Armenian representatives pointed out that 
the return of refugees to Abkhazia is very important for them, 
too, because a lot of ethnic Armenians, who have also been 
affected by the conflict, live in Abkhazia. Shevardnadze has 
said that the Georgian side will appreciate the involvement of 
the Republic of Armenia in the settlement of the issue. 
  The conversation also touched upon the work of the two 
parliaments. The sides have shared their experience. 
  The meeting was attended by Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, the 
deputy speaker of the Georgian Supreme Council.

<F P=106> ["Order of the Commander in Chief of the Republic of Georgia </F>
Armed Forces on the Introduction of Partial Organizational 
Changes to the Structure of the Republic of Georgia Ministry of 
Defense"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The process of the organizational development of 
the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces has shown us that the 
"special purpose," "rapid reaction," "mobile," and other 
battalions that were created in their time as part of the 
Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense Armed Forces are at 
present having a negative effect on the formation of regular 
Armed Forces and are creating difficulties regarding the 
formation of a unified system of commanding and controlling 
troops. These subunits were brought up to strength mainly by 
means of enlisting reservists and volunteers. 
  The structure of the Ministry of Defense Military Police 
does 
not correspond to contemporary needs. Military Police subunits 
are carrying out the same activities as the law enforcement 
bodies. 
  In order to create a unified system of commanding and 
controlling single armed forces, organize effective control over 
the activities of troops, and form and strengthen the principles 
of unity of command, I order: 
  1. Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense individual 
military units and subunits, in addition to fulfilling functions 
prescribed in accordance with the organizational and authorized 
structure of the Armed Forces, to be incorporated into the motor 
rifle brigades. 
  2. The Military Police Directorate existing in the Republic 
of Georgia Ministry of Defense system to be abolished and those 
subunits subordinate to it to be disbanded. The personnel 
making up these subunits and their combat weapons and equipment 
to be used in order to bring up to strength other army combined 
units, units, and military commandant's offices at military 
garrisons. 
  3. It to be pointed out that Military Police personnel 
fulfilled an important role in carrying out the orders of the 
commander in chief and the Ministry of Defense and in fighting 
for Georgia's state interests for which I express my gratitude 
to all officers and combat soldiers. 
  4. Town and rayon [administrative] heads to be entrusted 
with resolving the question of finding employment for those 
serving in the Military Police who do not wish to continue to 
serve in the Republic of Georgia Armed Forces. They are to 
report the execution of this order directly to me. 
  5. Military garrisons and commandant's offices to be created 
in all towns and rayons where military combined units and units 
are based; they are to be entrusted with establishing strict 
military discipline and order among military servicemen. 
  6. Armed groups and formations located on the republic's 
territory that do not form part of the Armed Forces to be 
disbanded and their personnel, weapons, combat equipment, and 
military property to be used in order to bring up to strength 
the motorized rifle brigades . 
  7. The heads of the Republic of Georgia Ministry of Defense, 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the State Security Service to 
be entrusted with implementing those measures stipulated in the 
order. 
  They are to report the execution of this order to me by 15 
June 1994. 
  8. The order to be communicated to the ranking personnel of 
the Armed Forces. 
  [Signed] E. Shevardnadze.

  [Text] A meeting of the Georgian Defense Ministry's newly 
appointed collegium was held on 23 June. The meeting was 
conducted by Lieutenant Genereal Vardiko Nadibaidze, the 
Georgian defense minister. Personnel problems, the provision of 
foodstuffs and material, and technical resources were the 
subjects of the straight talk held at the meeting. The defense 
minister sharply criticized some senior officials of the 
ministry for a lack of responsibility and negligence in their 
work that has caused a just resentment among the personnel in 
some of the military units. It has been indicated that a 
detailed program for the improvement of the current situation is 
to be worked up. Members of the military collegium of the 
Defense Ministry, as well as Armed Forces commanders have to be 
actively involved in the implementation of this program. Urgent 
assistance has been requested from the government and the 
authorities of the republic. 
  It is necessary to secure maximum efforts, a major sense of 
responsibility, and emergency operational conditions in order 
for Georgia to have a single and strong Georgian Army. 
  Special attention has been attached to problems revealed 
during the inspection of the 11th brigade. It has been 
indicated that the leadership of the republic demonstrates deep 
concern over the establishment of the country's regular army. 
Special attention toward military units will be increased. 
  This information was supplied by the Defense Ministry press 
service.

monetary policy. Information was presented by the head of a 
specially established team, Georgian Prosecutor General Jamlet 
Babilashvili. Brief information on the infringements was

monetary 
policy should be ready by 8 July. Materials on humanitarian

  [Text] The European Union [EU] summit is opening on the 
Greek island of Corfu on 24th June. Georgian head of state 
Eduard Shevardnadze has sent letters to the heads of 12 EU 
states and to European Commission chairman Jacques Delors. 
  The Georgian head of state reviewed the difficult economic 
situation in Georgia and dramatic aftermath of the Abkhazian 
conflict that has had an adverse effect on current affairs. 
Apart from that, the letters point out what is thought to be 
impeding the establishment of democracy and market economy in 
the former Soviet republics. And finally, the letters call for 
the heads of state to support a request that the EU grant aid to 
Georgia in the face of a difficult winter expected in the 
country due to insufficient stocks of fuel and bread. 
  Mr. Shevardnadze has indicated that a strategy to provide 
new 
independent states with economic assistance should be devised. 
This is essential for strengthening democracy and creating 
market economy in these countries, this being of major 
importance for stability worldwide.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alexey Ryshenko, acting commander of the </F>
Ukrainian fleet, by an unidentified correspondent; place and 
date not given: "We Will Torpedo Them"] 
  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Have you already considered the 
withdrawal of Ukrainian warships from the Crimea? 
  [Ryshenko] That would suit the Russians very well. The 
Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Our countrymen live there. We will 
defend them with weapons, if necessary. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Ukrainian and Russian warships are berthed in 
the same harbor at Sevastopol. Is a conflict not inevitable 
there? 
  [Ryshenko] The Russians want to force us out of Sevastopol. 
We are prepared for any provocation, for they know that as long 
as our fleet and soldiers are stationed in the Crimea, we will 
not permit an annexation to Russia. 
  [DIE WOCHE] The division of the Black Sea Fleet has been a 
subject of negotiations for two years. Does this fleet still 
have any strategic significance? 
  [Ryshenko] The fleet is outdated, its fighting power exists 
only on paper. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Then why does Ukraine not want to give up its 
share of the fleet? 
  [Ryshenko] Ukraine would do so immediately provided that the 
Black Sea Fleet left the Crimea. But the Russians will not hear 
of it. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Will the Fleet support the Crimean separatists 
in an emergency? 
  [Ryshenko] The commanders are doing what they want. They do 
not even obey Moscow. But I hope things will not get that far. 
And even if they do, we have enough strength in the Crimea to 
control any such mutiny. 
  [DIE WOCHE] The Russian commanders are warning against 
provocation. A clinic is supposed to have been stormed by 
Ukrainian special units. 
  [Ryshenko] Those are all lies. Why should we do anything 
like that? Everything in the Crimea belongs to Ukraine. It is 
the Black Sea Fleet that is stealing Ukrainian property. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What do you mean? 
  [Ryshenko] Many officers are engaged in business deals. 
Lubricants, spare parts, and maritime electronic equipment are 
being stolen from the bases. Vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are 
just like freighters that are transporting goods. They ignore 
Ukrainian customs and tax laws. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is there any proof of that? 
  [Ryshenko] In April, the ship Tshelekyen left Odessa harbor 
without permission. It had smuggled goods on board. Should 
anyone ever try that again, we will torpedo the ship. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is Kiev not heating up the situation in the 
Crimea unnecessarily? 
  [Ryshenko] There is no Republic of Crimea. The Crimea is a 
part of Ukraine. It was a great mistake to give the Crimea 
special status in 1992. Now the tension is increasing every 
day. The Black Sea fleet and the so-called Crimean president 
are to blame for that.

  [Text] Crimea -- During the election marathon on 24 June 
Leonid President Kravchuk of Ukraine met with workers of the 
"Nassinnytskyy" state farm and the village of Roskoshnoye. To a 
question about the division of the Black Sea Fleet, in 
particular about Oleksandr Moroz's remarks that the Black Sea 
Fleet should be a joint one, the president of Ukraine noted: 
"The fleet can either be single or divided but a joint one would 
mean that there would never be peace here." 
  According to Leonid Kravchuk, by law Ukraine has three types 
of forces: land, air, and sea forces. "As president I implement 
the Supreme Council law. If the Black Sea Fleet is a joint one, 
then the law of Ukraine needs to be changed," Leonid Kravchuk 
said. He also stressed that he is in favor of the main base 
being in Sevastopol, and he is convinced that this issue is not 
for the people of Sevastopol to decide in a referendum, but it 
is a matter for the states. 
  Touching on the issue of treaty relations between Crimea and 
Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that he "is in favor of granting 
the broadest possible powers to the regions, including Crimea." 
  Replying to a question about his attitude to Yevgeniy 
Saburov's opinion that "Ukraine does not need Central Committee 
ideologues now, but new politicians," Leonid Kravchuk said: 
"Entirely new politicians are needed now, who are not burdened 
with the Soviet Union's past." 
  Regarding contradictions between the constitutions of Crimea 
and Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk noted that Crimea's interests and 
new circumstances have been taken into account in the new 
Ukrainian constitution. 
  Commenting on information that wheat would not be harvested 
on an area of over 180,000 hectares in Crimea, Leonid Kravchuk 
reported that it is planned to adopt a resolution on assistance 
to rural areas in certain regions on 27 June. "Assistance to 
these regions is the main purpose of my trip," the president 
said. 
  Regarding the presidential election of 26 June, Leonid 
Kravchuk expressed the conviction that "people have practically 
determined their positions and one should not now expect an 
election struggle." 
  Commenting on the preliminary results of the Belarusian 
presidential election, in accordance with which Lukashenka (45 
percent) and Kebich (1.7 percent) [figure as received] have gone 
through to the second round, Leonid Kravchuk observed that "the 
people elect whoever is consistent in his policy."

  [Text] The problem of the Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Electric

but also for the entire world. This is why we welcome the 
decision by a session of the European Union council [word

to completely shut down the Chernobyl AES. It is important to 
check this amount continuously. 
  This was how Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk commented

said that, it was first necessary to resolve the issue of [words

  [Text] Ukraine can soon become a major exporter of 
domestically manufactured military hardware. Such a view was 
expressed by experts, helping Ivan Plyush, a presidential 
candidate, to conduct his election campaign. They published a 
paper with analysis of the situation in the industrial military 
complex and its prospects. 
  They contend that the most hopefull export commodity could 
be 
the T-84 tank designed in Kharkov. It is superior in its 
characteristics to both its Western counterpart and the Russian 
T-80 tank. Experts regard diesel submarines, anti-aircraft and 
anti-submarine missiles as equally promissing for Ukrainian 
export. 
  They revealed that next year the country plans to put out a 
new modification of the Kalashnikov automatic rifle, 
out-performing the basic model. They single out Asia as the 
most lucrative market for Ukrainian arms. An offer from an 
Indian company called Resources Argumentation is seen as 
particularly enticing for Kiev. Especially as they offer 
$5-$7.5 billion in long-term credit to advance Ukrainian 
industry. 
  When the USSR was in existence, Ukraine's share in the 
Union's production of arms amounted to 40 percent for 
spacecraft, up to 50 percent for tanks, and up to 15 percent for 
other arms. At the same time, by some statistics, up to 20 
percent of Ukrainian industry worked for defense. Since then 
the figure has shrunk to 10 percent. 
  Meanwhile, Ukraine and the U.S. have reached agreements to 
implement projects on converting some Ukrainian munitions plants 
to civilian production. This concerns a Kiev-based aircraft 
construction plant where civilian aircraft are planned to be 
assembled, the Malyshev plant (diesel engines production), and 
the Arsenal plant (medical equipment manufacture). 
  Experts estimate the conversion projects at $770 million.

  [Summary] Ukraine became a member of the Commonwealth of 
Danube Lands [Spivdruzhnist Dunayskykh Zemel] on 23 June. A 
session of the Commonwealth took place near Budapest on 23 June, 
where Ukraine was represented by Odessa Oblast. The issues of 
losses caused by UN sanctions against former Yugoslavia, the 
economy, the environment, and joint action by Danube lands in 
the areas of sport and tourism were examined at the session. 
Delegations from Germany, Austria, the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, Romania, and Bulgaria took part. 
  Ruslan Bodelan, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of 
Odessa Oblast Council, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, said 
at Budapest airport: "This is another step toward our state's 
claim to the possibility of resolving issues jointly with our 
counterparts, with other countries. This especially concerns 
use of the Danube artery as a river, along which cargoes can and 
should be transported with the help of our Danube Shipping 
Company. It is about resolving problems of the ecological state 
of the Danube, preserving our reservations and national parks, 
and developing national culture and national traditions."

Commission, 62.7 percent of the Crimean electorate turned out 
for the Ukraine presidential elections.

  [Text] Lvov 24 June TASS - On the eve of the forthcoming 
presidential elections in Ukraine, which are scheduled to be 
held on 26 June, presidential candidate Leonid Kuchma has 
appealed for support from residents of the south Ukraine, so as 
to relieve him of accusations of taking a "pro-Moscow" stand. 
  He explains to electorates that Ukraine cannot survive 
without close ccoperation with Russia. "One can hate the Russian 
autocracy, Stalinstic terrorism, but what it has got to do with 
contemporary economic cooperation with Russia," Leonid Kuchma 
said. "I am against dictatorship of Moscow, but for equal and 
mutually beneficial relations," he said. 
  It is difficult to say, how far effective this appeal will 
be. West Ukrainian electorates sympathize with current president 
Leonid Kravchuk. Three years ago at the first presidential 
elections they had opposed Kravchuk, and had supported his only 
adversary Vyacheslav Chernovil. Now there mood has taken a 180 
degree turn. 
  Undoubtedly, West Ukrainian votes won't be decisive in 
Sunday's presidential elections, but they can have a significant 
effect on the fate of one or the other candidate.

  [Text] Kiev -- To the question from a UNIAN correspondent: 
"What will you do if you find out that you have been elected 
president of Ukraine or that you have gone through to the second 
round of the election," Leonid Kuchma, a candidate for president 
of Ukraine, noted: "If I am not elected, I would cross myself 
with happiness." In the event of his election he would take his 
first steps in the economy because "the point from which one 
should begin is to bring order to one's home." 
  With regard to possible cooperation with Vitaliy Masol, 
prime 
minister of Ukraine, if he is elected president, Leonid Kuchma 
replied that this is a question to which he does not yet know 
the answer at the moment.

  [Text] Speaking at polling station No. 4 in Kiev, Leonid 
Kuchma today told Western correspondents that 90 percent of the 
Ukrainian people are on the brink of poverty. Everyone abroad 
seems to think that everything is nice and quiet in Ukraine. 
However, the danger of transforming Ukraine into a new 
Yugoslavia persists. Kuchma was obliquely criticizing the 
United States, which had promised economic aid to Ukraine in 
exchange for its nuclear disarmament. For now, all we have 
received are words, but not a cent. 
  Kuchma believes that there is no problem with the Crimea. 
The conflict there is a myth used for political purposes, he 
said. These words are regarded as a hint on Kravchuk's position. 
The former Ukrainian prime minister also said that no one can 
order the Russians to leave Sevastopol.

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Lev Ryabchikov for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 25 June TASS -- The Crimea, remaining an 
integral part of Ukraine, should become a free economic zone, a 
sort of a launching site for the economic processes, which will 
later be adopted by the whole of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma said 
here on Friday [24 June]. The Crimea became the last region he 
visited in the course of his tour of Ukraine as a presidential 
candidate. 
  The Ukrainian ex-prime minister, who, according to the 
results of some public opinion polls, is the second most popular 
politician after President Kravchuk, had meetings with electors 
at industrial enterprises and farms and held talks with senior 
officials from the Crimean Government. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Kuchma said that he liked 
the 
reforms which are being worked out in the Crimea. He expressed 
confidence that the Crimea could not be brought back to its 
previous state, that of one of Ukraine's regions. When tackling 
controversial problems, it is necessary to take into 
consideration the real situation, the characteristic features of 
each particular region, he said. In his opinion, talks between 
Ukraine and the Crimea should be on the same level as between 
Russia and Tatarstan.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Viktor Demidenko] </F>
  [Text] Dzhankoi (the Republic of Crimea) 24 June TASS -- 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk does not regard his tours of 
the country as a campaign for once again being elected to the 
country's top most post. He considers them as visits by the 
head of state, who wants to acquaint himself with the state of 
affairs in Ukraine, he said this after his arrival in the 
republic of Crimea due to the unprecedented drought that has 
struck the peninsula's steppe areas. According to old residents, 
they have not seen such a dry summer during past 20 years. 
  President Kravchuk was received at the Dzhankoi airport by 
Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Sergey Tsekov and other 
officials. But President of the Crimean Republic Yuriy Meshkov 
was not seen among them. During a press conference on the 
tarmac, Leonid Kravchuk said he does not regard this as a big 
tragedy. 
  The Ukrainian president told journalists that he intends to 
personally acquaint himself with the situation prevailing in the 
area due to the drought, and decide what help is needed by the 
people and farms. 
  When asked about his chances of once again being elected 
president, Leonid Kravchuk replied that every person has his 
chances, but they are determined by the electorate, who come to 
cast their votes. 
  Regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem, Leonid Kravchuk said 
that his stand remains unchanged. According to him, statements 
made by certain political leaders about not dividing the fleet 
and decide bases, do not stand up to criticism. "The fact is 
that this view pint is not shared by Russia and, in particular, 
by President Boris Yeltsin." "Besides this, the president 
emphasised, there is a law adopted by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, 
which states that the fleet be divided and bases for ships must 
be determined. And I, as head of state, must carry out this," 
he said. 
  Speaking of basing ships, Leonid Kravchuk emphasised that 
the 
Black Sea Fleet base should not be designated as the city of 
Sevastopol, but as Russia's Black Sea base in Sevastopol. 
According to him the Ukrainian Navy, apparently, will be based 
in Balaklav.

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk told journalists 
Friday that the differences between the Constitutions of Ukraine 
and Crimea could be resolved by adopting a new Ukrainian 
Constitution, which would recognize the interests of every 
region and take into account what he called new circumstances. 
Meanwhile, he said, every individual and region had to abide by 
the existing Constitution. 
  Kravchuk thought that as much power as possible could be 
given to Crimea on the proviso that Ukraine remained an integral 
whole. 
  He recalled that under Ukrainian legislation and 
international law Crimea was part of Ukraine and this should not 
be changed. 
  The conflict of Crimean and Ukrainian legislation started on 
20 May 1994 when the Crimean Supreme Soviet restored the initial 
6 May 1992 wording of the Crimean Constitution under which the 
relations between Crimea and Ukraine were to be guided by a 
treaty between them and Crimean residents could have dual 
citizenship. 
  Kiev demanded that the Crimean Constitution be aligned with 
Ukrainian legislation.

  [Text] Kiev -- In reply to the question from a UNIAN 
correspondent, "What will you do if you find out that you have 
been elected president of Ukraine or that you have gone through 
to the second round," Leonid Kravchuk said: "If I am at home at 
the time, I will have a glass of cognac. If I am at work, I 
think I may do the same, and then I will get on with ordinary 
matters." According to Leonid Kravchuk, the question "What will 
you do if you find out you have been elected president" is a 
problem for the other candidates for president. For all his 
brilliant imaginings about the presidency, another candidate 
does not know what steps to take, while Kravchuk has been taking 
these first steps for two and a half years; therefore, he does 
not have this problem, he says. 
  Leonid Kravchuk sees his priority actions in the event of 
his 
election to president of Ukraine as implementing his program, 
while making use of all of the best points from the programs of 
the other candidates for this post, and also the formation of a 
government. 
  Leonid Kravchuk considers his cooperation with Vitaliy 
Masol, 
Ukraine's prime minister, to be "normal," observing that Masol 
is not a "closed book" to him, because they once worked 
together. "Of all the contenders for the post of president of 
Ukraine, only I know him, and therefore I do not have a 'Masol 
problem.' If someone else is elected, however, then he will 
have this problem," Leonid Kravchuk said.

  [Text] Kiev 26 June TASS -- "Ukraine will march the road of 
radical political and economic reforms. This is for sure. We 
have no other way if we want to build an economically strong and 
independent state and if we want to improve the life of people," 
incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk said in reply to journalists 
after casting balloting papers at one of Kiev's polling stations 
on Sunday. 
  "If I'm elected president, I shall continue reforms, shall 
work to resolve all difficult issues concerning the state and 
the government," he continued. 
  He stressed that special attention "will be given to 
privatisation, a change in currency regulation, the tax system, 
price formation, labour remuneration and pensions. 
  "It will be necessary to tackle urgently also foreign 
economic problems: Customs houses, customs duties, relations 
with other states and stimulation of exports to earn hard 
currency."

  [Text] Kiev, 26 June (TASS) -- The development of relations 
with Russia should have a priority importance, Leonid Kravchuk 
said today after he cast his ballot at one of the Kiev polling 
stations. "They just cannot be other than a priority for us," he 
stressed. 
  Kravchuk expressed confidence that "no matter who will 
become 
president of Ukraine, he will have to proceed from the 
assumption that relations with Russia should have a special 
status, taking into consideration the past and the future of our 
two countries. If we forget about it, we shall put in a 
difficult situation both Ukraine and Russia." 
  "I shall be very glad if my words are met with understanding 
by the Russian leaders. If we learn to speak about each other 
in this way, to respect each other, I am sure 70 per cent of 
problems we are facing today will be removed. This is the most 
important, the central problem of our policy," he said. 
  "The problem of the Chernobyl power plant is extremely 
important not only for Ukraine, but also for the whole world. 
This is why we welcome the decision of the summit session of 
the council of the European Union to allocate 500 million ECU 
on the implementation of plans of a complete shutdown of the 
power plant, but the sum should be calculated once again," 
Kravchuk said, commenting on the decision of the EU council. 
  The Ukrainian leader told ITAR-TASS that "the first problem 
to be resolved is that of the future of the city, of the people 
who live there... We still do not know how much money is needed 
for resolving the problem of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."

of Ukraine, I will insist on parliament immediately considering 
the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said in an interview with 
TASS on Sunday [26 June]. 
  Kravchuk reported that he had already submitted his 
proposals 
on this issue to parliament. 
  "Joining the treaty, although with certain reservations, has 
been the only correct step taken by Ukraine in this direction," 
the president stressed. 
  He is convinced that "the world and the Ukrainian people 
itself will estimate this step at its true worth." 
  Kravchuk expressed confidence that the newly-elected 
parliament would resume considering this document.

Mikhail Melnik] 
  [Text] Kiev, 26 Jun -- "Alliances based on ethnic identity 
are dangerous per se, for they inevitably engender nationalism, 
panslavism, and all that ensues from it," Ukraine's President 
Leonid Kravchuk told ITAR-TASS today, when asked about a 
possibility of creating a Slav union. "Both politicians and 
historians condemn it, knowing that that is where aggravated 
nationalism is rooted," he said. 
  Leonid Kravchuk also believes that this question is not 
quite 
specific in practical terms. "As for a union, one should then 
speak in terms of East Slavs, rather than Slavs. Otherwise, 
what should one do with Poland, Slovakia, Yugoslavia, or 
Bulgaria? Thus, the Slavs will be divided into Western Slavs 
and Eastern Slavs," he summed up. One should bear in mind that 
about 30 million Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians live 
beyond the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. "The Slav 
Union will inevitably create problems for them." "By having such 
a union, we will split in two those states where Slavs and 
non-Slavs live." Kravchuk is convinced that "by this step we 
will begin dividing states of the former Soviet Union." He 
expressed the belief that this would be followed by creating 
Asian and other unions, and "then horrible confrontation will 
begin." 
  "One should not raise questions that are ready to be 
resolved 
today, neither theoretically nor practically. One should live 
and follow the chosen path: build independent states but not on 
the basis of ethnic identity," he said. "We are building a civil 
society in Ukraine and Russia is building the same society in 
its country. If we pursue a different policy a social explosion 
is possible. Russia is also not 100 percent a Slav state." 
  "I advocate economic relations, integration, and the use of 
the CIS in resolving issues that can be resolved by good will," 
Kravchuk said. In his opinion, one should not try and establish 
new structures and organizations immediately, he said. One 
should do everything to avoid confrontation between states and 
peoples, he said.

  [Text] Kiev 26 June TASS -- "Ukraine's Supreme Soviet 
cannot limit the head of state's powers after presidential 
elections" unless the latter agrees to it, Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk told TASS on Sunday [26 June]. 
  "In case the parliament takes this path, it should first ask 
for the people's approval," he added. 
  If in three months the parliament "raises a question about a 
referendum, this may spell the termination of its activities, 
since people will not stand any new elections or referendums," 
the president believes. 
  Kravchuk is confident that lawmakers will not choose to take 
this move. In his opinion, if the parliament tries to restrict 
the president's powers without his agreement, this will lead to 
confrontation entailing grave consequences. 
  However, Kravchuk fears that left-wing lawmakers may revise 
the course approved by the 1991 people's vote and currently 
pursued by Ukraine. "This may cause confrontation," he said. 
  The president is strongly convinced the people advocates its 
state's independence and such values as personal freedom, family 
and confidence in the future. If a person is not economically 
free to choose the form of ownership, or areas for applying his 
or her intellectual and professional potentials, any talk about 
rights and liberties will be out of place. For these reasons, 
the president believes one should not trifle with such things as 
politics, property, social security and armed forces. 
  We should proceed along the road we have chosen, Kravchuk 
said. We should improve our political line and adjust it, if 
appropriate, that is to revise our tactics rather than strategy. 
Otherwise, we will face confrontation and war, the president 
emphasised in conclusion.

  [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- On 24 June the 
political council of the Constitutional-Democratic Party of 
Ukraine circulated a statement on the decrees by the president 
of Ukraine "on urgent measures to ensure correct legislation on 
trade and to step up the fight against black marketing" and "on 
urgent measures to return currency valuables to Ukraine." 
  The statement refers to the first decree that will lead to 
the "ruination of trade which, for some reason, is being 
permanently called black marketing." Tremendous powers vested 
by this decree in state bodies, including the fire inspectorate, 
and the right to determine "the expediency of accommodating 
trade facilities" will inevitably lead to the further 
development of corruption and trade's transition to the "shadow 
[as received]." "The ruination of trade was not the last of the 
factors which resulted in an end to the all-Ukrainian market 
ceased, and the volume of production has decreased as a result 
of this," says the statement. "Abuses in state trade can be done 
away with only with large-scale privatization and 
demonopolization of state trade and an end to price regulation," 
believe the Constitutional Democrats. 
  The decree on the return of currency valuables will have 
opposite consequences: Currency will forever remain in the 
West. In the opinion of the Constitutional Democratic Party, 
both decrees are purely populist. They show Leonid Kravchuk as 
a person who is ready to harm country's economy for the sake of 
winning the election.

  [Text] Poltava-Cherkassy, [no date as received] -- On 25 
June President Leonid Kravchuk visited Poltava and Cherkassy 
Oblasts, where he met local residents. 
  Replying to a UNIAN correspondent's question on where the 
danger was in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's draft law "on 
introducing amendments and additions to the Ukrainian law `on 
the formation of the bodies of local power and 
self-government,'" which he recently vetoed, and whether he 
assessed this draft law as a deliberate move by the left-wing 
majority in parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed out: "This 
draft law was adopted in violation of three articles of 
Ukraine's Constitution, and it does not matter to me who 
violates it, either the left-wingers or the right-wingers, 
because everyone must respect the Constitution, while the 
Supreme Council and the president should provide an example of 
respect. If this kind of attitude toward the Constitution is 
displayed at this level, then it is necessary to announce that 
we have no Constitution and that we live in compliance with 
current laws which are adopted either by the left-wing or the 
right-wing majority." 
  As far as private ownership of land is concerned, which 
Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz recently spoke out 
against, Leonid Kravchuk replied that neither the president nor 
the chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council solves this issue, 
but the Supreme Council of Ukraine does, as a legislative body, 
proceeding from the proposals to be put forward by the regions, 
as well as the decisions by the oblast councils and also 
people's will. "I have already said that all the talk about 
democracy, citizens' rights, and freedoms should be discontinued 
if a citizen of Ukraine, who wants and who can buy a plot of 
land is banned from doing this," said Leonid Kravchuk.

  [Text] Odessa, 26 Jun -- The "Ukrayina" Oblast Electoral 
Committee has received telephone calls about violations of the 
Electoral Law. For example, at most polling stations in 
Suvorovskiy, Kievskiy and Ilyichevskiy rayons of Odessa, the 
election posters of Vladlen Ilyin, representative of the 
president in Odessa oblast and candidate for the post of oblast 
council chairman, were removed, while posters of his rival, 
Ruslan Bodelan, were prominently displayed at all polling 
stations. 
  There was open electioneering for Lev Vershynin, candidate 
for deputy to Odessa town council, and Leonid Kuchma, candidate 
for president of Ukraine, at polling station No. 18 of central 
electoral district 366 of the town of Odessa. When an observer 
remarked on this, the response was a threat to call the militia.

  [Text] Kharkov -- Commenting on the course of the 
pre-election campaign in an interview with a UNIAN correspondent 
on 25 June, officials of the regional state administration and 
Mykola Seleznyov, secretary of the regional electoral 
commission, confirmed numerous violations of the electoral law, 
such as the misuse of office, transport, and human resources, 
and the use of financial resources above the norm. 
  Kharkov residents are saying that some constituency 
commission members are going to elderly electors' apartments, 
carrying boxes and writing out their passport details and taking 
samples of their signatures. 
  Mykola Seleznyov said that he is concerned at there being a 
number of violations which overall could affect the results of 
the ballot in some constituencies.

<F P=106> [Report by Marianne Sajdik: "`Ukrainians in Favor of </F>
Privatization'"] 
  [Text] "I have voted against the red dictatorship," a 
young man shouted, gesticulating fiercely. A few seconds later 
he was arrested by the militia. Election Sunday in Kiev: In 
front of the number four ballot station in the prosperous Old 
Kiev area, the Ukrainian intelligence service was hanging about 
in small groups. Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma was the 
first to cast his vote in these presidential and municipal 
elections, shortly after 0900. Asked by DER STANDARD, why he 
had only turned towards Russia during his time in office, Kuchma 
said: "When you have only beetroots in the fields and when 
petrol cans are empty, you have to go to Moscow." 
  If he, Kuchma, becomes president, he will make sure there is 
a new parliament. Reforms will continue, the Ukraine can do 
without humanitarian aid. But the West should find some money 
for industry. Russia has driven Ukraine to the wall; for four 
months' supply of natural gas, Kiev has had to pay $1 million to 
Russia, and $800,000 to Turkmenistan. During his presidency, 
Ukraine would become a member of the European Union, Kuchma 
said. This would have to happen before 1997, the year when the 
president's legislative term ends. 
  President Leonid Kravchuk came to the ballot station shortly 
after 1100. Speaking to DER STANDARD, Kravchuk was convinced 
that he will win the elections: "People understand my policy; 
like me, they are in favor of privatization, although parliament 
is against it." If parliament tried to cut his rights as 
president, this could result in a dangerous confrontation, 
Kravchuk said. 
  Kravchuk spoke out in favor of a political and economic 
confederation of Belarus, Russia, and the Ukraine. A union of 
all Slavic nations would, however, be dangerous, because 30 
million Slavs living in the Asian republics would return: "We 
cannot take them all in." In addition, the Asian nations might 
also form a union, which would not help anyone. In conclusion, 
Kravchuk said that so far the West has only promised help 
without delivering it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa Dzhemilov, chairman of the Crimean </F>
Tartar Council, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given: "Autonomy!"] 
  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] Who are the Crimean Tartars supporting 
in the Crimean conflict? 
  [Dzhemilov] The Crimea is our homeland. We are trying to 
reestablish Tartar autonomy within the confines of Ukraine. The 
young Ukrainian state is not responsible for the crimes against 
our people. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Most of the population of the Crimea are 
Russians. Do they have no right of self-determination? 
  [Dzhemilov] Russian claims to the Crimea stem from their 
conquest thereof in 1783. The Tartars are indigenous to the 
Crimea. We are not going to accept annexation to Russia 
passively. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Have you not backed the wrong horse? 
  [Dzhemilov] During the 211 years of Russian colonization, we 
have not experienced anything good about Russia. The Tartars 
were drive out of their homes, and Russians were settled in 
their place. In 1944, Stalin had the Tartar population deported. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Might not your warm feelings toward Kiev drive 
the Russians and Tartars further apart? 
  [Dzhemilov] We are already being discriminated against 
everywhere. There is no work for the 250,000 Tartars in the 
Crimea. Unemployment has reached 40 percent. Our health 
situation is catastrophic. We constitute 10 percent of the 
population, but 30 percent of its patients. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What would the Tartars do in the event of an 
armed conflict between Ukraine and the Crimea? 
  [Dzhemilov] Should fighting break out, we will know how to 
defend ourselves. We are well organized, and can deploy defense 
troops in the shortest time.

<F P=106> [Two untitled, unattributed reports on election scene in </F>
Ukraine] 
  [Text] A sensational publication from a yet to be 
published book by Vitaliy Masol, the newly elected head of 
Ukraine's government, has appeared on the eve of the elections. 
The author paints a rather unappealing portrait of his protege 
[as published]. Masol says that none other than President 
Kravchuk masterminded the introduction of the 
"governor-generals" [namestniki] institute which caused 
confusion and, in effect, dual power in the regions. None other 
than the president guaranteed: Deposits in the Savings Bank will 
be reliably protected. Owing to inflation, however, millions of 
people were robbed only a few months later. "Fraud, 
manipulation of public opinion, and thinly disguised graft are 
widely used by Kravchuk to shore up his shaky positions," 
remarks V. Masol. [first report ends] 
  The republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea 
points out in its statement that the most reactionary circles at 
the present time are pooling their efforts and openly speak in 
support of the candidacy of the current head of state L. 
Kravchuk. This poses a real threat to Ukraine because it leads 
to preserving the course toward self-isolation, nationalist 
restriction, and deepening degradation of society. 
  The republic committee of the Communist Party of Crimea in 
this connection pledges its support to Leonid Kuchma. Factors 
in Kuchma's favor are the provisions of his election program, in 
particular the demand for an urgent search for ways toward 
economic integration with Russia and the other CIS republics and 
giving Russian the status of a second state language. It is 
precisely for this reason that the Communist Party of Crimea 
calls upon all communists and all the voters to vote for Leonid 
Kuchma on 26 June.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk today began his working 
trip to southern Ukraine with a visit to Dzhankoyskyy rayon in 
the Crimea, our special correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko reports. 
The economy in this part of the Crimea is literally paralyzed 
by the lack of diesel fuel on the eve of the harvest campaign. 
Due to adverse weather conditions, thousands of hectares of 
crops have perished. It is expected that the harvest will be 
significantly lower than usual. As the head of our state noted, 
the main goal of his visit is to examine the state of affairs in 
the agricultural sector of Dzhankoyskyy rayon, and to take 
quick, decisive, and efficient measures to provide assistance. 
  Answering a question from a correspondent of Ukrainian 
radio, 
citing the fact that some of Leonid Kravchuk's rivals in the 
presidential race support a joint command over the Black Sea 
Fleet, Leonid Kravchuk stated that this standpoint is shared by 
neither the Russian leadership nor President Boris Yeltsin. 
Everyone has come to the conclusion, Leonid Kravchuk said, that 
the fleet can be either single or divided, but there will be no 
peace under this unusual -- so-called joint -- status. By the 
way, Leonid Kravchuk noted, servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet 
understand this. 
  Leonid Kravchuk also stated that, according to legislation 
adopted by our Supreme Council, Ukraine should have three types 
of armed forces -- land, air, and naval. Therefore, he, as 
president, executes Ukrainian laws. If the Black Sea Fleet was 
to fall under joint command, the law would have to be amended, 
and one would have to state that Ukraine does not need a navy. 
The president also noted that he advocates, and will continue 
to advocate granting as many powers as possible to the Crimea, 
provided Crimea remains an integral part of Ukraine in 
accordance with the Constitution and international norms. 
Otherwise, if there is a coup against Ukraine's territorial 
integrity, all this will make no sense, the president emphasized.

  [Text] Simferopol, 24 June -- Presidential Candidate Leonid 
Kuchma visited the Republic of Crimea. In Kerch, he met the 
director corps and employees of the Kerch Metallurgical Combine 
lease association and the "Zatoka" ship-building works (an 
enterprise in the military-industrial complex). 
  His meeting with the Crimean Republic's agrarians took place 
in Simferopolskiy rayon. Professor Serhiy Nikolskyy, Crimea's 
minister of agriculture and food, took part in the meeting. 
  At a meeting with voters Leonid Kuchma said that if he 
becomes president of Ukraine he will resolve the problem of the 
Black Sea Fleet by leasing it out on condition of receiving free 
energy carriers from Russia, and blamed the previous government 
and parliament for the ratification of the START-1 Treaty, in 
accordance with which Ukraine lost nuclear fuel, which according 
to Leonid Kuchma would have been sufficient for six or seven 
years.

  [Text] Well, the first reports are beginning to come in 
from Ukraine. Igor Kirpichov, a correspondent from RIA news, 
has rung our editorial office and his information is about 
Sevastopol. The townspeople have elected the city council; 
Viktor Semenov received the most votes. The residents of 
Sevastopol also had to answer the question of whether they agree 
to Sevastopol being the main base of the Russian Black Sea 
fleet. Ninety percent of the voters responded in the 
affirmative to this question. I repeat that this was a RIA 
report. 
  Well the situation regarding the candidate for the president 
of Ukraine is still not clear.

  [Text] Lvov 24 June TASS -- The Ukrainian National Assembly 
(UNA), which has a combat paramilitary organisation UNSO 
(People's Self-Defence), has become the initiator of the 
formation of an anti-fascist committee and appointed Oleg 
Vitovich, a nationalist from Lvov and people's deputy to the 
Ukrainian parliament, as committee chairman. 
  UNA leader Anatoliy Lupynis, in an interview with the UNIAN 
news agency, said the democrats and liberals were the 
locomotives of political fascistisation in Ukraine. 
  It is noteworthy that it is precisely the selfsame democrats 
and liberals who refer to the UNA-UNSO organisation as a modern 
neonazi one, because its militants participated in the recent 
military conflicts in the Dniester region, Georgia, 
interconfessional strife inside the state, and now leave for the 
Crimea for summer "holidays."

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economics Andrey Chernyavskiy by </F>
V. Savchenko under the rubric "Economics: The Market, Reforms": 
"The Most Dangerous Thing Now Is Not To Do Anything"] 
  [Text] Crimeans are expecting concrete actions from the new 
government today. And one must say that a start has been made. 
The Program of Economic Reforms for 1994-98 was considered and 
approved at the meeting of the government. Ahead lies its 
approval by the Supreme Council. 
  We addressed several questions to one of the program's main 
developers, Minister of Economics Andrey Chernyavskiy. 
  [Savchenko] Andrey Vasilyevich, which initial steps must be 
taken for the economy of Crimea to emerge from its crisis 
condition? Are these envisioned in the program? 
  [Chernyavskiy] Yes, the program earmarks tasks for the 
medium-range future that must be carried out during the course 
of this year. First of all we must improve legislation, 
contribute to the establishment and strengthening of economic 
ties with suppliers of raw material and consumers of products, 
implement a complex of measures for improving the system of 
credit for enterprises, and try to supplement their working 
resources. These tasks ensue from an overall analysis of the 
situation in Crimea, which is given in the first part of this 
program. 
  The situation in Crimea, as throughout all Ukraine, is 
indeed 
difficult since the transition to a market economy is proceeding 
more painfully than in Russia. This is related to the slow 
progress along the path of reforms. Privatization is being drawn 
out. In spite of the fact that the old levers for management of 
the economy have been lost, certain elements of the old system 
remain. For instance, the fixed exchange rate between the 
karbovanets and foreign currencies, the system of ministries, 
and the system for distribution of financial resources and 
regulation of wages. Last year Ukraine experienced 
hyperinflation, which is causing a sharp drop in the standard of 
living of people, primarily those who receive incomes from the 
budget. But they include physicians, teachers, and pensioners. 
The only positive tendency in Ukraine's modern economic policy 
is its course toward strengthening the karbovanets. But this, in 
turn, is having a painful effect on the financial resources of 
enterprises and incomes of the population. Enterprises are 
experiencing a deflation shock. Prices continue to rise out of 
momentum. The production slope has become ingrained and, since 
the beginning of the year, industrial production has decreased 
by more than 30 percent. 
  [Savchenko] And which enterprises are already standing idle? 
Foton? 
  [Chernyavskiy] Foton is still in operation, but the 
Dzhankoyskiy machine building plant has been shut down. 
Completely. 
  The government is faced with the problem of normalizing the 
activity of Crimean enterprises and agriculture during this 
transition period and setting up a financial-credit system. In 
our opinion, it would be a good idea to bring foreign banks into 
the territory of Crimea. They would be the conductors of foreign 
investments, they would make it possible to reduce credit rates, 
and perhaps they would also make it possible to effectively 
invest the funds of both the population and the enterprises. 
But, so far, this intention of the Crimean Government is 
encountering stiff resistance from Ukraine. In the banking 
sphere its government is conducting a policy of isolationism and 
refusal to allow foreign banks on its territory. 
  The amount of internal capital needed to open a new bank has 
also increased. It is equivalent to 3 million ECU's. At the 
market exchange rate this is $1 million. Not everyone can meet 
this requirement. 
  I should also like to mention the fact that Crimea is not 
getting its fair share of credit resources. It is necessary to 
enter a negotiating process with Ukraine so that the republic 
will receive them at least on the same level as other oblasts. 
This would make it possible for enterprises and trade 
organizations to breathe more freely. 
  [Savchenko] Do you discuss the crucial problems of the 
present day with the leaders of the enterprises? 
  [Chernyavskiy] Yes. Conversations with directors show that 
there are many obstacles to their normal activity. The Crimean 
economy is extremely open and many enterprises are oriented 
toward trade primarily with Russia. They receive raw material 
from there and Russia is a sales market for their finished 
products. But, as of today, trade with Russia is extremely 
difficult if only because of the demand for prepayment 
introduced by Ukraine. Russia can be a sales market if goods are 
delivered there without demanding prepayment. As a result of 
this requirement problems have arisen for the Foton plant, 
although Russian trade is ready to buy Simferopol television 
sets in order to sell them there. 
  The government will contribute to concluding agreements, 
including on the territorial principle. Perhaps on this basis we 
will succeed in setting up mutual deliveries of finished 
products so as to invigorate industry and agriculture. 
Additionally, we will search for financial resources for 
resolving the agrarian situation. Perhaps steps will be taken to 
work on incomplete construction projects. It would be hard to 
speak of this with complete confidence at this point. 
  [Savchenko] Will privatization be started in Crimea? The 
previous deputy corps, as we know, placed a moratorium on it. 
  [Chernyavskiy] Privatization is being dragged out 
disgracefully in the Crimea. The Ministry of Economics has 
prepared a privatization program that will be submitted to the 
government for discussion and then to the Supreme Council. We 
already have a thick file of applications from enterprises for 
privatization, although I must say that the directors have 
various attitudes toward this process. The four trade ports that 
ended up on the list for privatization according to the edict of 
the president of Crimea (and Ukraine also) are categorically 
against it. And world experience suggests that the majority of 
ports in the world are not private property. But the enterprises 
are basically in favor of privatization. 
  Since Ukraine considers a number of enterprises to be its 
property it could begin the privatization process itself. 
Certain steps have already been taken in this direction, 
incidentally. By an edict of the Ukrainian president a state 
petroleum and gas holding company has been created in which the 
Chernomorneftegaz Association accounts for more than half of the 
property. This alarms us extremely. 
  [Savchenko] You have exchanged the chair of a scholar for 
the 
post of minister--is that the fashion today? 
  [Chernyavskiy] It seems to me that the activity in the 
ministry is interesting and forward-looking, and, of course, I 
am counting on doing something useful for Crimea, for otherwise 
it would not be worth getting into this. But our Moscow team 
began to work in a very difficult period. The situation may get 
worse for a number of reasons that are beyond our control. The 
government of the transition period is very much under the gun. 
It can always be accused of allowing things to get worse than 
they were. We are in a difficult situation because our work with 
the Supreme Council is not going smoothly and we do not know 
when it will. But the most dangerous thing now is not to do 
anything. The government will take steps in all the directions 
earmarked in the program. 
  [Savchenko] Is your ministry's team fully staffed? 
  [Chernyavskiy] It is very difficult to recruit people. The 
salary of the minister is about 1 million karbovantsy. The 
workers will receive even less. 
  Naturally, it is difficult to find educated, energetic 
people 
who are willing to work for such wages. 
  [Savchenko] How much time does the Moscow team intend to 
spend working in Crimea? Will you last long? 
  [Chernyavskiy] I do not know how long we will last. But 
catching up with things, learning about the enterprises, drawing 
up more concrete action plans, implementing them, setting up 
stable contacts with Kiev, and evaluating the first results of 
the reforms will take a minimum of about two years. We would 
like to be useful to Crimea, the Crimean economy, and the people 
who are living on this peninsula.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Druzenko, Leonid Kapelyushnyy, and Boris </F>
Reznik under the rubric "Independent Journey by IZVESTIYA 
Correspondents Across Independent Ukraine": "Part Seven. 
Chernobyl, June 1994..."] 
  [Text] Kiev-Chernobyl -- Arriving in Kiev, we bought the 
newspapers and read: "Yet another accident at Chernobyl AES's 
[nuclear electric power station] second power unit." Naturally, 
we headed for the station. 
  It is silent in the 30-km exclusion zone. Not a single 
vehicle passes us. On each side of the track are what look like 
low tumuli overgrown with grass (these are homes or scaffolding 
dug into the ground). We drive past the silent fifth (now 
almost ready for action) and sixth units and roll up to the 
square that is so familiar from photographs and cinema and 
television stills, where the Ilyich [Lenin] whose name the 
station bears stands as if on sentry duty. In the control 
center little green letters on a dark screen carry an 
advertisement for the seances of some healer who works miracles 
and can even cure "the evil eye." Probably people go there 
believing and hoping, but thinking that the station itself needs 
to be cured of "the evil eye." 
  We go to see the director, where it turns out that we have 
been beaten to the mark by television journalists from the 
popular Ukrainian independent television company "Tete-a-Tete." 
They are on a special assignment: to dispel fears. And here 
in the main controller's room shift chief Sergey Sharshun is 
already smiling broadly into the microphone: 
  "Dear citizens of Kiev, nothing serious has happened at our 
plant. If anyone thinks that he has a tickle in his throat, let 
him drink a little mineral water -- the background round here is 
absolutely normal...." 
  He is calm -- sincerely calm -- yet in Kiev there is once 
again the sort of agitation which cannot be measured in numbers. 
Everyone is asking: What has happened there this time, and once 
again at the ill-starred second unit; there has already been a 
hydrogen explosion there, damaging the turbine and bringing down 
the roof. What now? 
  "No, it is not an accident this time, not an accident," 
Sharshun assures us, as he has just assured television viewers. 
"It is a mundane unscheduled situation. A crack had formed in 
the metal of a vessel containing contaminated water. But it was 
emptied, as laid down in the safety procedure, into an empty 
container nearby...." 
  Whereupon they remind you that the same sort of thing has 
happened at other stations -- at the Leningrad Station, for 
instance -- and no one has been bothered except the specialists; 
but here of course, there is the "nark of Chernobyl." 
  There is a watershed of consciousness here: Outside the 
station there are global fears on account of the Chernobyl 
catastrophe, its consequences, and most of all -- God forbid -- 
the possibility of a repetition; while inside the station itself 
everything is normal, a repetition is impossible, the first unit 
could operate until the year 2007, the others -- longer still, 
and they should be allowed to do so. 
  You can understand the Chernobyl people. They live under 
constant pressure: The station could be closed down at any 
minute. Three times the Ukrainian parliament has adopted -- and 
revoked -- such a decision. The government is the same: Now it 
promises that the station will continue to operate, now it signs 
a statement on the time scale for closure. True, Kravchuk has 
been here, promising his support; moreover, a directive has been 
issued to start up the second unit by the end of next year. 
  Everything is as it should be, but every straw in the wind, 
even the lightest, the Chernobyl people themselves say, inclines 
the answer to the question "To be or not to be?" toward "not to 
be." Especially since the world community is still on its 
guard, and since at the beginning of July the G-7 heads of state 
are meeting in Naples especially to examine the question of 
shutting down the Chernobyl station. There is a direct conflict 
of interests between the 25,000 inhabitants of the new city of 
Slavutich, which was built for the AES employees, and the ideas 
of the U.S. and French presidents, the British and Japanese 
prime ministers, and the German chancellor.... 
  The Chernobyl personnel are confident, and they would 
reassure the G-7 leaders, if they could get to Naples. And it 
is clear why. They came here from all over the Union, they earn 
good money -- from 3 million to 87 million karbovantsy, which in 
local prices is actually quite a lot -- and most of all they 
live with amenities which they could not even have dreamed about 
before, some in excellent apartments, many in individual homes 
built on the BAM [Baykal-Amur Railroad] principle: There is a 
Yerevan quarter, a Vilnius quarter, a Tallinn quarter, a Moscow 
quarter.... Must they lose all this at a stoke? 
  At the station we met several veterans who worked here 
before 
the catastrophe, and continue to do so (they are actually called 
"predisasterites"]. They are strong, healthy people. But then 
we discovered that such people only constitute 10 percent of the 
present work force. Where are the rest? Where have they gone, 
what shape did their destinies take? We were told absolutely 
nothing of consequence on this score. 
  You can also understand Sergey Parashin, the station's 
current director, who took up the post only two months ago. He 
has one constant concern: to preserve the station and to keep 
the collective from a social and psychological explosion. So he 
talks about speculation on the consequences of the disaster 
("the more brazen ones milk the situation for all it is worth"). 
It is possible that this does happen, but in our tour of the 
Crimea and Truskavets sanatoria we had seen sick children with 
"Chernobyl-related" illnesses. Here, both at the station and in 
Slavutich -- we sensed this -- they somehow abstract themselves 
from the tragedy. They live, as is seemingly natural, concerned 
with their immediate cares -- their work and daily bread. And 
they see many things in "their own" light. Take the 
aforementioned G-7. Are they worried about safety? No way! 
They want to close Chernobyl first, in order to close down the 
Russian stations with similar reactors afterward. Why? To 
acquire a new sales market, since the major corporations which 
produce equipment for AESes are going bust. So they are pushing 
their interests through the nuclear lobby in various 
international organizations.... 
  It is not for us to judge how serious such hypotheses are, 
but that they exist is a fact. All the same, you get a sense of 
some confusion from the Chernobyl people's calm and assurance. 
But are they really working with faultlessly safe equipment? 
Is there really absolute radiation safety in and around the 
station itself? 
  As many people know, today the Chernobyl AES's most 
vulnerable spot, its Achilles heel is the "sarcophagus" under 
which the fourth power unit was buried. The press and the 
television from time to time report that the "sarcophagus" is 
not hermetically sealed and that radioactive substances are 
being discharged through it into the atmosphere -- and in 
considerable quantities. 
  "Is this true or not?" we ask Boris Goncharov, the station's 
deputy head engineer. 
  "Right now," he explains, "we are indeed closing chinks in 
the `sarcophagus' which have formed where the reinforced 
concrete structures join. But total hermetic sealing is not 
only unnecessary but actually dangerous. There must be a 
constant interchange of air within the covering. As for 
discharges from the `sarcophagus,' they are within the permitted 
norm." 
  That is a specialist's viewpoint. How are we nonspecialists 
to judge it? If everything is within the norm, that means 
everything is in order. But it turns out that there are other 
specialists with a different view. Back in Kiev, we phoned the 
Ukrainian State Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
and spoke to Deputy Chairman Anatoliy Demyanenko. His opinion 
is that the Chernobyl AES must be shut down, and as quickly as 
possible, since according to many parameters it fails to meet 
world safety requirements. And all is not well in the 
"sarcophagus," he believes: There should be no leakages from 
it, and the interchange of air should be carried out not 
"anyhow," but through special ventilation pipes. 
  But most important of all, inside the reactor of the 
destroyed unit, buried under the "sarcophagus," the upper plate 
has shifted to an angle of 45 angles. What if it falls? What 
will happen, what will be the possible discharge, and where and 
how far will the wind carry the death cloud? 
  Another "stress factor" for station employees and Slavutich 
inhabitants is the ambiguity of assessments, expert analyses, 
and conclusions. But it is not just their own drama, as it were 
"genetically" fixed in the Chernobyl tragedy. Deceit, 
falsification, and vagueness continue to characterize the 
situation, and all the while the question hangs over station: 
To be or not to be? 
  As we were leaving we saw the sun set over Slavutich -- it 
was breathtaking. There are giant catfish in the rivers, 
although not for eating, you understand....

  [Text] Tehran, 25 Jun -- The latest round of 
Iranian-Russian consultations on achieving a Karabakh settlement 
was held today in the Iranian capital. The participants 
included Vladimir Kazimirov, a plenipotentiary representative of 
the Russian president and the head of the Russian mediation 
mission; and Morteza Bank, director general of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry. 
  V. Kazimirov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent after the 
consultations that they had discussed the proposals to settle 
the crisis that had been put forward by Russia and within the 
framework of the Minsk Group of the CSCE. The Iranian 
representatives assessed Moscow's initiatives as "close to the 
requirements of reality." For our part, V. Kazimirov noted, we 
consider the Iranian position to be well considered and marked 
by an understanding of the objective situation. Iran showed an 
interest in achieving the swiftest possible settlement and 
cessation of hostilities. "In the Karabakh conflict there is no 
side that has not suffered," V. Kazimirov said, "and there can 
be no winner. Those involved in the conflict have, of course, 
sustained differing losses. We understand the pain of 
Azerbaijan, which has lost so much territory and has had to deal 
with the appearance of such a large number of refugees. Nor, 
however, have the Armenians gained anything from the war." 
According to the Russian presidential representative, during the 
consultations the Iranians did not display any partiality toward 
any of the sides involved in the conflict. 
  In the course of a news conference in Tehran, Iranian 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized that the 
Islamic Republic is ready to do everything it can to halt the 
bloodshed in the Transcaucasus. Answering a question from the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, he stated that "Iran considers 
Azerbaijan to be the injured party." 
  It was agreed that the next round of consultations will be 
held in Moscow.

  [Text] Athens, 25 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
described as "historic" the agreement on partnership and 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European 
Union signed on 24 June on the island of Corfu. He made this 
statement while answering questions from journalists at Athens 
airport before his departure to Russia. 
  A really historic document has been signed, he said. It was 
under preparation for a very long time, almost two years. 
Europe is now the only continent that has lifted all 
discriminatory measures against Russia. Indeed Russia, of 
course, gets certain dividends from this. The states of Europe 
get a very rich Russian market, and they too, will not lose out 
by having signed this document. 
  The president thanked the Greek leadership and Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou for their involvement in the 
preparation of the agreement, and for creating most favorable 
conditions for the work of the Russian delegation.

  [Text] On Friday in Moscow, an agreement to avoid dual 
taxation was signed at the end of a two-day sitting of the 
Intergovernmental Commission on Trade-Economic and 
Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Russia and Slovakia. 
In addition, as was announced in the press, the same day the 
parties plan to conclude an agreement which would resolve the 
problem of the debt of the former USSR to Slovakia. 
  According to the Chairman of the Slovak Commission Brigita 
Shmegnerova, deputy chair of the Slovak Government, the parties 
negotiated the issue on compensation of Slovakia's debt to the 
former USSR as the Russian Federation acts as its legal 
successor. The Slovak delegation proposed to settle this problem 
by increasing deliveries of Russian goods and granting rights to 
Slovak firms to use industrial capacities of the Russian 
enterprises in the frameworks of cooperation. 
  Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov, co-chairman of the commission who 
represents the Russian Federation, declared that the parties 
have reached an agreement to attract representatives of Russian 
regions to cooperate in the sphere of oil supplies from Russia 
to Slovakia.

  [Text] Friday morning the Federation Council of the Russian 
parliament failed to accept in principle a draft resolution on 
President Yeltsin's decree "On Emergency Moves to Protect the 
Population Against Banditry and Organized Crime as a Whole". 
  The committee on constitutional law-making and courtroom and 
legal issues won the heaviest support in a straw vote on four 
alternative drafts. When, however, it was put to roll-call 
vote, the committee's draft garnered less than one half of the 
overall ballot. 
  The returns highlighted the differences voiced in the 
discussion of the anti-crime decree. Yuri Chernichenko, who 
represents Moscow in the Federation Council, said the underworld 
used the national constitution as an umbrella and called on the 
fellow-legislators to defend the man-in-the-street who lived in 
constant fear for his life and property by supporting the 
anti-crime decree. 
  In the meantime, fellow-legislator Valeriy Rastorguyev of 
Tver felt the decree deprived the citizens of their 
constitutional rights and its enforcement translated into the 
introduction of a state of emergency. He called for the 
creation of expert emergency commissions instead of instructions 
which "empowered every other law and order officer to fight 
crime". 
  The Federation Council may be expected to resume discussion 
of the anti-crime legislation, if it has time for it, on Friday.

  [Text] One of the reasons representatives of democratic 
forces did not advance to the second round of presidential 
elections lies in their disunity -- this according to Viktar 
Ivashkevich, secretary of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] 
Executive Board, while speaking to BELAPAN about the results of 
the 23 June presidential elections. 
  He recalled that BNF had once appealed to presidential 
candidates Karpenka and Shushkevich to withdraw their 
candidacies in support of [BNF Chairman] Zyanon Paznyak. 
Karpenka was forced to do that, but Shushkevich did not take 
this step, and the democratic forces now have to pay for the 
shortsightedness of such a policy. Still, even if there had 
been no disunity among democrats, Ivashkevich believes 
Lukashenka would still have had a better chance for victory. 
"Our citizens still want to try the taste of communism," the 
BNF secretary said, "let them do that." 
  Asked what tactics the BNF will use in the second round, 
Viktar Ivashkevich replied as follows: "We will not participate 
in the dispute between the communists and Komsomol members (this 
relates to Kebich and Lukashenka -- BELAPAN). The front will 
concentrate on the consolidation of its ranks and preparation 
for the parliamentary elections."

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 24 June TASS -- Russian and 
Moldovan secret services should pool their efforts against 
criminal activities that threaten the safety of Russian and 
Moldovan citizens, Moldovan National Security Minister Vasile 
Calmoi said here today before signing the treaty on cooperation 
with the Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. 
  Service head Sergey Stepashin arrived in Kishinev today on 
an 
official visit. 
  The treaty provides for information exchange and interaction 
of the Russian and Moldovan secret services against terrorism, 
contraband, illicit arms sales, drug trafficking. The two 
services will also prevent attempts of citizens of third states 
to use Russian and Moldovan territories for illegal transit. 
  The sides take an obligation not to carry out force or 
subversive actions against each other. In the words of Calmoi, 
Moldova and Russia have signed similar agreements with the 
Ukrainian Secret Service. 
  The treaty is another proof that Russian secret services 
plan 
no subversive actions against Kishinev, a representative of the 
Russian Federal Counter-Intelligence Service's delegation told 
ITAR-TASS. Russia keeps to unconditional recognition of 
independence and territorial integrity of Moldova. 
  Speaking of the Trans-Dniester problem, the official said it 
"should be settled only peacefully and the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service will help it with all legal means." 
  Stepashin and Calmoi will leave for the Trans-Dniester 
region 
on Saturday to visit Russian troops stationed in the area.

  Speaking of the negative reaction to the proposal to extend

what he had read in yesterday's newspapers it was clear that 
those who wanted no stability were making the sharpest 
statements and distorting the situation. 
  Shumeyko said his statement did not mention the president, 
while PRAVDA maintained that he had done all this for the 
president. He said he concluded from response of Sergey 
Baburin, Mikhail Gorbachev, SOVETSAKAYA ROSSIYA and PRAVDA that 
he was not backed by those who did not want stability. He said 
this was proof that his statement had hit the mark.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Savchenko] </F>
  [Excerpts] Anatoliy Borisovich, professor Belkin has 
recently published interesting figures. He says more or less 
the following. Privatization and combating inflation are all in 
vain. Nothing will come out of it. Why? Because we have 
excessive military expenditure. Because in the economic respect 
we are in a state of war. A country can afford such an amount 
on military expenditure only when it is in a state of war. 
Indeed, more than 40 trillion rubles. [passage omitted] The 
question arises: what does the government think? 
  [Chubays] Let us look at the factual side of what you have 
just said. Indeed, the share of the military expenditure in the 
budget which has been approved is very high. The figure you 
have just mentioned is correct--more than 40 trillion rubles. 
With the budget's revenue of 120 trillion rubles, this is 
indeed a huge portion. Nevertheless, one should understand 
where it comes from. Where does our present army and our 
gigantic expenditure on it come from? In fact, we have 
inherited almost all of the former Soviet army of the Soviet 
Union that, as one knows, was in confrontation with nearly the 
whole world. 
  [Correspondent] It seems we have inherited the Brezhnev 
stagnation. 
  [Chubays] Exactly. It is the case when we have to finance 
the army we had in the past although today we simply do not need 
such a big army either from the political, economic, or 
financial viewpoint. But can one resolve this problem just like 
that, in one go? Can one half the expenditure on the army as 
soon as from tomorrow? What is the army? The army consists of 
human beings, soldiers and officers who are returning from 
Germany and the Baltic's. They are returning to Russia where 
they do not have either accommodation or work, or real income, 
or savings they can live on. 
  [Correspondent] But under the present state of the economy, 
I 
mean the present military expenditure, they will never have 
highly-paid jobs or accommodation? 
  [Chubays] Are you suggesting that we should tell them to 
leave the army, that we should say goodbye to them for the time 
being while we are improving the economy. Perhaps in two or 
three years we would succeed and then they could have a good 
life. No, this is not the way. Here, indeed, I agree with 
Belkin that the situation must be radically changed. It's the 
simple truth. But one cannot change the situation simply by 
reducing the expenditure, that's the point. The situation could 
be changed through a very profound reform in the army. We 
should reform the mechanism itself. Yegor Gaydar said very well 
at the recent congress of Russia's Choice that one cannot bring 
down the number of soldiers to the number of generals. The 
number of generals should be brought in accordance with the 
number of soldiers. This means that a profound army reform is 
needed which would essentially mean a reduction in the numerical 
strength and an improvement in the financing of those who are in 
the army. 
  [Savchenko] But that is as far as the army is concerned. 
After all, our legendary military spending is the legacy, among 
other things, of our famous military industry, which in peace 
time was 70 percent of our whole industry. Now it constitutes 
perhaps 60 or 65 percent? 
  [Chubays] You are wrong. It comprise just about 15 percent 
of all industry. Here are some concrete figures for you. In 
the first six months of 1994 spending on the purchase of 
military hardware for our military and industrial complex has 
been cut by 60 percent. Incidentally, we say today that 1994 is 
marked by decline. I can assure you that nearly 50 percent of 
this decline can be accounted for directly by the cuts in 
government spending on the purchase of equipment and military 
hardware. That is the most that one could have done in that 
respect. That this process cannot be continued on the same 
scale is another matter because a living enterprise, millions of 
people working there, and a whole range of social problems are 
at stake. This aspect of the problem can be resolved not just 
through paying less but through profound reform of the actual 
economic mechanism. Then a tank factory will not have to close 
down but will be able to change over to the production of things 
which people need. 
  [Savchenko] Incidentally, has privatization helped this 
process? 
  [Chubays] Undoubtedly. Here is a living example. Take for 
instance my native St. Petersburg and its LOMO enterprise, the 
Leningrad Lenin optico-mechanical association. This is a very 
famous company. Its output used to be solely military. It is 
now in a most difficult situation because of spending cuts in 
the military industry. Fourteen thousand people used to work 
there. Now just 11,000 are employed there. No doubt there will 
be further cuts. This very plant, having carried out 
privatization--not without its own battles incidentally--certain 
structures put up very tough resistance. Nevertheless, it was 
privatized with our support, and it became a joint stock 
company. It has begun the process we have just been talking 
about. It was not just a matter of becoming a joint stock 
company. The organization had to elaborate an in-depth plan for 
the restructuring of all production relations. It had to 
provide for a change in the nature of the output, and carry out 
a study of the existing market, a transition to the production 
of a new type of output, a restructuring of the internal 
production structure, a change in the structure of the 
administration of the enterprise, and finally staff cuts. 
  So, what is now happening at the LOMO. Two figures can 
characterize it: the LOMO share price--that is the price written 
on the share certificate--is 500 rubles, yet the market price of 
the LOMO shares is now 75,000 rubles. Among the LOMO's share 
holders are the world's major companies with names known 
worldwide, such as Credit Suisse [word indistinct] Boston and 
others which can see that following the restructuring, the LOMO 
has an enormous potential in the next tens and even hundreds of 
years. That is thanks only to the fact that a little while 
back, the LOMO opted for privatization which opened up all these 
opportunities. 
  [Savchenko] Anatoliy Borisovich, will we be able to hope 
that 
next year military spending will be reduced. 
  [Chubays] I think that the volume of military spending will 
be cut next year, but the beginning of a real army reform--it 
cannot be postponed for years any longer--is a prerequisite for 
this. The reform must be started this year so that we could 
make our army cuts next year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray, Russian deputy prime </F>
minister and leader of the Party for Russian Unity and Accord 
[PRUA], by Sergey Vasilyev under the "First-Hand" rubric; place, 
date not given: "From Commonwealth to Confederation. Sergey 
Shakhray Believes That the Situation in the Post-Soviet Space Is 
Related to Internal Processes in Russia"] 
  [Text] [Vasilyev] Sergey Mikhaylovich, Nursultan 
Nazarbayev has put forward the idea of creating a Eurasian 
Union. A few months ago the Party for Russian Unity and Accord 
[PRUA] published its own draft Confederal Agreement... 
  [Shakhray] Our interest in the problem can be said to be 
"transparent." First, the party's course toward deepening 
integration was stated in the PRUA electoral platform, and we 
think we are obliged to deliver on the pledges given to our 
voters. Second, these processes are directly related to what is 
going on inside Russia itself. The Russian Federation is far 
from indifferent to how our compatriots feel in the "new 
abroad." And finally, third, entirely new economic and 
geopolitical foundations have now had time to emerge in order to 
bring closer together peoples who have traditionally been linked 
for historical and economic reasons. 
  [Vasilyev] What specific steps are you going to take in that 
direction? 
  [Shakhray] You probably know that literally a week ago we 
held a "roundtable" of scientists and politicians devoted to the 
problems of the new integration within the post-Soviet space. 
It luckily coincided with the initiative by our Kazakhstani 
colleagues -- Nursultan Nazarbayev's blueprint for a Eurasian 
Union. The roundtable brought together representatives of 
nearly all Commonwealth republics, some delegations were 
represented by deputy prime ministers and ambassadors. We 
discussed all sorts of aspects of the emerging integration 
process. 
  Matters of the legal formalization of these processes and 
phases of agreed actions were also discussed. Participants in 
the discussion agreed that only consistent, businesslike, and 
balanced talks on forging new interstate relations can help set 
up a rational basis for cooperation, whether it is called a 
European Union or a Confederal Commonwealth. 
  [Vasilyev] Don't you fear that initiatives of this kind may 
"explode" the existing Commonwealth of Independent States by 
proposing in its stead still vague forms of a new, albeit 
closer, integration? After all, any fruit must be given time to 
ripen.... 
  [Shakhray] What you call the "fruit" has long been overripe. 
It is another matter that it would by no means serve our 
interstate interests to allow processes to unfold outside 
official collaboration channels. Following up on your 
metaphorical argument, one might say that the fallen fruit 
should be picked up by the "right" partners suited for 
international relations, namely official structures and 
officials entitled to resolve these matters. 
  I state with the utmost responsibility that the logic of the 
new unification must fit in with the logic of the development of 
cooperation within the CIS regardless of whether 5 or 10 states 
are willing to form the confederation. We insist that the 
Commonwealth be maintained and enhanced, and we see agreements 
within the CIS as the sine qua non for holding talks on setting 
up a confederation. The Russian leadership should finally name 
official participants in the process so as not to leave this to 
extremists. This is our first condition. Second, we oppose a 
rash, "across-the-board" solution to the problem. A decision 
based on considerations of political expediency. Third, we do 
not think it possible to hold talks within so "narrow" a circle 
of participants, even if it is made up of historically and 
ethnically close countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. 
Russia is more than just an Orthodox country. Moreover, Muslim 
peoples account for one-third of its population. Here there can 
be no prior "selection" on the basis of ethnic or political 
criteria. 
  [Vasilyev] How do you see this future state alliance so far 
cautiously called a form of "further deepening of integration"? 
  [Shakhray] The initiatives of the PRUA and the Kazakhstani 
president have sparked an unexpected discussion of the following 
question: What is preferable -- a confederation or a Eurasian 
Union? We do not think that these initiatives are in any way 
opposed to each other. The project of our counterparts from 
Kazakhstan effectively also entails a confederal form of 
integration. This is the reason why Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Russia is certainly ready to 
hold talks on a confederation, but as for the Eurasian Union 
plan, it will do so only after "specific decisions are made by 
parliaments and political leaderships" does not appear valid. 
  The problem lies completely elsewhere: What forms of 
confederal cooperation are currently acceptable -- economic, 
political, or security collaboration? Can one set up new 
confederal structures covering the entire range of interstate 
relations or not? In that regard, the practice of the current 
CIS institutions, including its Executive Secretariat, can give 
us lots of hints. 
  Evidently we should pick and choose among agreements within 
the CIS that have already been signed: Some of them have 
already surpassed the level of interstate agreements and evolved 
into confederal ones without asking for permission; some 
documents do not work at all; in other areas "virgin territory" 
from a legal point of view is emerging, and so forth. This 
expert appraisal of sorts, for starters, will make it possible 
to single out the legal framework for effective integration and 
to identify "bottlenecks" and "blank spots" in the treaty 
foundation. 
  Just as important for the search for the foundation of a 
confederation is analysis of agreements concluded at the 
interregional or, if you like, "border" level between the CIS 
countries. For instance, between Russia's Omsk, Orenburg, 
Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Novosibirsk Oblasts and Altay 
Kray and Kazakhstani oblasts bordering them; between Russia's 
Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Rostov, and Voronezh Oblasts and the 
neighboring Ukrainian oblasts. In many instances these are 
readymade "prototype" models for the regulation of future 
relations. It is the border areas closely tied together by the 
need to pursue a coordinated economic policy, intensive trade, 
and, in a way, "regional diplomacy" that have brought into being 
forms of cooperation that come closest to the model of a 
confederation. 
  Finally, we should make up our mind with regard to medium- 
and long-term tactics in solving the following problem: Who 
will be integrated and on what basis, and also when and in how 
many stages can the integration be carried out? 
  [Vasilyev] Are you also a proponent of giving the economy 
priority in integration? 
  [Shakhray] Not quite. At present, the new confederation's 
most urgent task is finding a solution to the problem of crime, 
which, as is well known, does not recognize borders. The second 
most important task is to ensure the CIS states' collective 
security. Economic cooperation sort of "permeates" these 
clusters of problems, ensuring that urgent economic and 
financial matters are resolved. In particular, the problem of 
nonpayments and mutual settlements with the states where the 
Russian ruble still "operates" has yet to be resolved. 
Something else that is on the agenda is joint investment in 
projects of "Eurasian importance," for instance, those same 
problems of border protection or the struggle against crime. 
But large-scale economic integration will become possible only 
when we are able to harmonize the legal foundations of economic 
activity, which have already "run far away" from each other, and 
to settle mutual debts. There should be no illusions here. 
  [Vasilyev] To what extent are the CIS countries' new 
entrepreneurial structures and banking capital interested in the 
new integration? 
  [Shakhray] There is no need to rack one's brain for 
examples. For instance, back in April there was an international 
conference of central and commercial banks of the Commonwealth 
countries. They called for an Interstate Bank and a payment 
union within the CIS. They are already drawing up independent 
proposals on these matters. From this point of view, we should 
welcome and give every possible support to private and state 
initiatives by industrialists, entrepreneurs, and financiers 
objectively aimed at "sewing together" the economic fabric of 
the CIS countries, which has come unraveled. 
  It is important to support the particular trends that have 
emerged very recently that I would call manifestations of 
personal freedom. The new entrepreneurs, new economic managers, 
and new financial-industrial groups are interested in such 
integration just as much as those who still feel nostalgia for 
"the greater homeland." These people born of the new epoch can 
devise forms of economic integration that cannot be broken by 
any "iron fist" or someone's nationalist logic. 
  Our multinational working group is ready to cooperate with 
all business leaders who see integration as something they have 
a long- term personal stake in. After all, these are the 
interests of the Russian state. 
  [Vasilyev] What other forms of dialogue at the interstate 
level could you suggest? 
  [Shakhray] Why shouldn't we suggest that the presidents of 
our republics -- members of the CIS Council of Heads of State -- 
set up a new deliberative body at this level modeled on the 
Presidential Council? Why shouldn't this "CIS Presidential 
Council" set as its main goal the enhancement of the strategy 
and tactics of reintegration? Let this council be formed not ex 
officio, but by mutual consent by those who can really 
contribute to taking efficient, effective, carefully weighed 
steps along the path of integration between the Commonwealth 
countries. In that regard it is important that it include not 
only public figures, scientists, experts, and analysts, but also 
industrialists, bankers, and also distinguished mass media 
leaders, those of them who have already made significant headway 
in creating a single cultural-information space in the CIS 
countries. 
  [Vasilyev] At what other levels can the negotiating 
process also unfold? 
  [Shakhray] This is already happening in reality. Our 
"roundtable" and a number of other forums devoted to this 
particular problem held in a whole range of the CIS countries 
within the past month alone have shown that the main sponsors of 
the movement are citizens themselves -- members of political 
parties, public organizations, scientists. If we manage to set 
up an interstate commission, it will be tasked with preparing an 
analysis of the entire body of CIS documents with a view to 
enhancing integration and working out an official stance on 
forming confederal bodies that will be presented in a report to 
a CIS summit. Another group that will operate in parallel with 
the interstate commission is the multilateral working group to 
be set up in accordance with the results of the "roundtable." 
It will be assigned the role of a civic expert on confederation 
matters. We invite representatives of political forces in all 
the CIS countries, not just Russian public groups, to take part 
in its activity. 
  A significant number of public action centers have already 
emerged -- they are reintegration's "spearheads," as it were: 
the multinational working group, the Eurasian Commonwealth 
Charter, the "Eurasia 21st Century" project, and others. Given 
the lack of a coordinating strategy, this multipolar movement is 
already giving rise to jealous fears that "everyone is beginning 
to grab more than their fair share of the Eurasian cake." 
  I think that there should be no such fears. As for me, I do 
not cling to priorities or personal trappings of distinction. 
It will be good if the multinational working group makes an 
effective contribution to furthering the ideas of a confederal 
Eurasian Union, but it will be not bad, either, if the forum 
called "Toward a New Accord" sends strong impulses in that 
direction as well. Let us join forces and try to raise our 
civic, public initiative to an even higher level. 
  [Vasilyev] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has 
chosen the idea of Eurasia as the ideological component for the 
new integration processes. Do you think it will be a sufficient 
basis for an effective future confederation? 
  [Shakhray] There is no denying that the idea of Eurasia in 
itself symbolizes the unity of the destinies of the peoples in 
the current so-called "post-Soviet space." It cannot be ruled 
out that public opinion might more naturally accept some other 
integration ideology -- this is still a matter open for 
discussion. But at present it is clear that Eurasianism, as was 
the case earlier, has again become the banner of a very 
difficult, "transition" period. It has yet again reminded us of 
"the desire for a common cause" typical of our peoples, a desire 
that tends to awaken at the direst moments of history. Let us 
hope that this time around the idea will serve as a reminder of 
common roots, traditions, and joint, fruitful policy.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 25 TASS ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a 
report about the concluding of Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to 
the U.S. Under the headline "Al Gore Enthusiastic, Chernomyrdin 
Reserved." The Russian prime minister attended in the U.S. a 
regular session of the intergovernmental Russian-American 
commission on economic and technological cooperation. U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore described the results of that work as 
remarkable success. 
  TRUD publishes in this connection an interview with 
Chernomyrdin, who assures the public that the money spent on the 
visit did not go to waste, including from the social point of 
view. "What are actually the contracts on space exploration that 
the delegation is bringing home?" the journalist asked 
Chernomyrdin. The prime minister said in reply that "in fact, 
they mean support for our industry, specifically, its branches 
connected with arms manufacturing, those where conversion is now 
going on, which are in a difficult situation today." He pointed 
out that Russian-American relations were assessed only in a 
positive way and rejected inventions of those 'prophets' by both 
sides of the Atlantic, who predict the worsening of those 
relations. "This is out of the question. Our relations are 
improving and will continue to improve," Chernomyrdin said. 
  The newspaper carries contradictory comments of deputies to 
the State Duma about the recent decree of President Yeltsin "On 
urgent measures to protect the population from gangsterism and 
other manifestations of organised crime." For example, A. 
Ledzins from the December 12 group believes that if the decree 
is put into effect, this will get Russia back by more than 50 
years, to the period when the dividing line between law and 
arbitrariness actually ceased to exist. However, N. Travkin, 
leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, thinks that it is too 
late already to try and resolve the crime problem with the help 
of civilised methods. "Instead of arguing with the decree, it is 
necessary to adopt as quick as possible the laws that will 
permit to really start tackling it," he said. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and other newspapers highlight President 
Yeltsin's statement at the Kerkira island, Greece, who said that 
the agreement on partnership and cooperation between the Russian 
Federation and the European Union, signed there, is a document 
of great historic importance, which made it possible to take a 
decisive step towards the restoration of unity in the european 
continent. In the opinion of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, one of major 
results of Yeltsin's trip is that the European Union and Russia 
will start looking for ways to create a free trade zone. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA publishes an interview with Aleksandr 
Tushinskiy, first deputy defence minister of Belarus, who is 
advocating the restoration of ties between the two countries, 
including between Russian and Belarusian arms-manufacturing 
enterprises. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA highlights the results of presidential 
elections in Belarus, where, according to the preliminary 
results, the lead was captured by Aleksandr Lukashenko, head of 
the parliamentary anti-mafia commission, who got 40-45 per cent 
of votes. In this connection the newspaper describes as 
"political amateurishness" appeals in the State Duma, 
specifically those of Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of its 
committee for ties with CIS member states, who urged at a 
special press conference to support Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich at the elections in Belarus, and ex-prime 
minister Leonid Kuchma -- at the elections in Ukraine. In the 
opinion of the newspaper, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is 
"the only politician who is capable of keeping Ukraine away from 
sliding down from economic difficulties to political 
confrontation of individual regions and social groups." 
  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA writes that, by voting for Lukashenko, 
"Belarusians actually voted against Yeltsin," because the 
Russian president had a meeting with Kebich shortly before the 
elections. The newspaper describes Kebich's visit to Moscow as a 
"gross mistake". In its opinion, the trip eroded his prestige, 
because Yeltsin in not popular in Belarus. 
  Ths same idea is expressed by PRAVDA in its article on this 
subject, which is entitled "Lukashenko Packing Suitcases of his 
Rivals." The newspaper highlights the words of Yuriy Belov, 
chairman of the central executive committee of the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation, who believes that "socialism 
has not disappeared, because the communist movement in Russia 
has not disappeared either." In his opinion, opponents of 
socialism "are especially afraid of its new image", which is in 
line with historic traditions of the great Russian nation. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article about prospects of 
settling the Russian-Chechen crisis. It writes that the 
relations between the two countries (on the level of 
authorities) "have entered a new stage of development." 
President Yeltsin's decision to start talks with the Chechen 
authorities, the recent trip of Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudaev to Sochi and the "pro-Yeltsin tone of official statements 
coming now from Groznyy" are proof to that, the newspaper points 
out. However, the initial stands of the two sides are 
diametrially opposed to each other, and this is why the talks 
are not going to be easy.

  [Text] Friday morning the Federation Council of the Russian 
parliament failed to accept in principle a draft resolution on 
President Yeltsin's decree "On Emergency Moves to Protect the 
Population Against Banditry and Organized Crime as a Whole". 
  The committee on constitutional law-making and courtroom and 
legal issues won the heaviest support in a straw vote on four 
alternative drafts. When, however, it was put to roll-call 
vote, the committee's draft garnered less than one half of the 
overall ballot. 
  The returns highlighted the differences voiced in the 
discussion of the anti-crime decree. Yuri Chernichenko, who 
represents Moscow in the Federation Council, said the underworld 
used the national constitution as an umbrella and called on the 
fellow-legislators to defend the man-in-the-street who lived in 
constant fear for his life and property by supporting the 
anti-crime decree. 
  In the meantime, fellow-legislator Valeriy Rastorguyev of 
Tver felt the decree deprived the citizens of their 
constitutional rights and its enforcement translated into the 
introduction of a state of emergency. He called for the 
creation of expert emergency commissions instead of instructions 
which "empowered every other law and order officer to fight 
crime". 
  The Federation Council may be expected to resume discussion 
of the anti-crime legislation, if it has time for it, on Friday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report from the "Azerbaijan" column: </F>
"Geydar Aliyev Plans To Go to Tehran, Receives Iranian 
Diplomats"] 
  [Excerpt] President Geydar Aliyev has received 
representatives of Iran's Foreign Ministry: Deputy Foreign 
Minister Morteza Sarmedi and culture representative Ramin 
Mekhmanperast [names as transliterated]. The Azerbaijan 
president said that in spite of his busy schedule he always, and 
with great pleasure, receives guests from Iran, also expressing 
profound condolences over a recent tragic incident in Iran: an 
explosion at the Mashhad mosque. 
  The Iranian guests spoke about their visits to the Ministry 
of Culture and Press, the TV and Radio Company, and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry 
the sides came to the general conclusion that the situation in 
the region is extremely unstable and calls for more intensive 
interstate contacts, discussions, and joint political actions 
because what is going on here noticeably impacts on world 
politics. 
  In this respect Geydar Aliyev's upcoming visit to Iran is 
very important. Sarmedi stressed that the close friendly links 
that have been established between the two states should be 
thoroughly strengthened because these interrelations influence 
the whole region. President Aliyev for his part said that he is 
making serious preparations for his visit to Iran, attaches 
great importance to it, and hopes that the negotiations there 
will substantially help consolidate friendship and cooperation 
between the fraternal peoples. 
  The meeting then went into a closed session, as was the case 
with the meeting between Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul 
Guliyev and UN representative to the republic Mahmud al-Said 
[name as transliterated]. After a brief welcome speech the 
journalists were asked to go, leaving them, as usual, to guess 
at the content of the upcoming talks. Journalists from 
Habar-Service only managed to learn from a foreign diplomat that 
the UN appropriates to Azerbaijan $31-32 million in humanitarian 
aid while local UN officials want to have this sum increased to 
$40 million. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F>
Mikhail Melnhik] 
  [Text] Kiev 27 June TASS -- According to preliminary data 
in Ukraine's presidential election, held on Sunday [26 June], 
ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma and current President Leonid 
Kravchuk will fight it out for the country's top seat in the 
second round of voting, due to be held July 10. Kravchuk 
gathered the most votes, ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources. 
  According to Ukrainian political observers, Kravchuk seems 
to 
have a good chance of retaining his job. His reelection would 
ensure stability in Ukraine's foreign and internal policies, 
maintain the now-noticeable trend towards economic stability, 
and prevent an outbreak of political conflicts, they say. 
  Kravchuk, 60, began his political career as a Communist 
Party 
member. He has admitted that the high point of his career 
should have been department head in the Ukrainian Communist 
Party's Central Committee, but fate apparently had different 
things in store for him. 
  Kravchuk resigned his party membership after the August 1991 
coup attempt in Moscow, and was elected president of Ukraine in 
December of that year with a significant margin of victory over 
his opponents. 
  Kravchuk started agitating for a postponement of the 
presidential election early in June, arguing that the absence of 
a new Ukrainian constitution, the undefined powers and 
responsibilities of the president, and imperfect structure of 
the executive branch made it difficult to fairly elect a 
president. The new session of parliament, however, confirmed 
its predecessor's judgement, and the electoral campaign entered 
its final heat. 
  In less than one month Kravchuk visited all the regions in 
the country, signed an agreement between Ukraine and the 
European Union on cooperation and partnership, and issued a 
series of decrees aimed at improving the social and economic 
situation in the country. His rating grew so much during that 
period that his competitors were left far behind. The 
practically-unanimous support of voters in western Ukraine, who 
christened the president "national-democrat number one," formed 
the core of Kravchuk's electoral success. 
  Predictions concerning ex-premier Kuchma's fate seem to have 
been justified as well. Kuchma, 55, stood at the head of the 
government for 11 months, and now leads the Ukrainian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. His platform revolves around 
the need for a union with Russia, which is supported by a large 
percentage of Ukraine's population. Among Kuchma's assets is 
the support of the factory managers and, the presidential 
candidate is hoping, their shop workers as well. 
  Political experts have not overlooked Kuchma's minuses 
either. Under his leadership, the government soon fell under 
sharp criticism. At that time, Kuchma admitted to reporters 
that he did not read newspapers, because he did not like 
everythihg that he saw printed there. When the premier became 
convinced that he could not manage the state apparatus, he 
resigned his job. "I do not intend to carry that heavy cross 
until my death," he declared then. 
  Although he left his post as prime minister, the former 
industrial boss was far from renouncing political activity 
altogether. "I am not going to fall out of the orbit of politics 
or burn up like a meteor" the presidential hopeful announced.

percent, Leonid Kravchuk 7 percent. Petro Talanchuk and Ivan 
Plyushch got 2-3 percent. 
  -  Sevastopol: Leonid Kuchma 82 percent. 
Petro Talanchuk and Ivan Plyushch got 2-3 percent, and 
Volodymyr Lanovyy and Oleksandr Moroz got slightly more than 
Talanchuk and Plyushch. 

  In conclusion, Pohorilko emphasizes that these are only 
preliminary results, not the final figures. In general, the 
candidates winning the most votes are Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid 
Kuchma; the candidates with the next largest number of votes are 
Oleksandr Moroz and Volodymyr Lanovyy.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries 
remarks by Police Colonel-General Mikhail Yegorov, first deputy 
interior minister and head of the ministry's main department for 
combatting organised crime, in connection with the presidential 
decree "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population from 
Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organised Crime". The 
decree took effect on Monday. 
  Yegorov said that more than 200 well-organised and heavily 
armed criminal groups operate now in Moscow alone. Criminal 
groups commit 1,500 crimes in Russia every month. He said 
rejection of the presidential decree by many officials and 
politicians is accounted for by the fact that they are 
businessmen themselves and it would be disadvantageous to them 
if law enforcement agencies get access to commercial information 
and, what is most important, would be able to trace the tortuous 
ways their money travels through. 
  Corruption in close conjunction with organised crime has 
penetrated all spheres of state administration, the Interior 
Ministry spokesman stated. He said that in 1993 alone police 
discharged more than 500 operatives who collaborated with 
criminal groups, selling day-to-day information. There were 
even personnel members who together with bandits were involved 
in murders. Criminal proceedings were instituted against them 
and they were dismissed from internal affairs agencies. Several 
high officials were arrested in Vladimir region and Komi 
Republic. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA gives the opinion of Issa Kostoyev, 
chairman of the federal council committee for constitutional 
legislation and court and legal matters, that the decree runs 
counter to the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code, the 
Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities, and the Law 
on Banks and Banking Activities. As a result, innocent people 
may be affected. 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER), referring 
to statements by spokesmen of the Russian Interior Ministry, 
writes that "no cardinal changes, no sweeping round-ups or 
searches (in view of the entering into force of the 
above-mentioned decree -- note by ITAR-TASS) are planned. 
Simply, `it will be easier for police to act'. 
  "Do you think that we were looking forward to the decree as 
a 
starting pistol signal? We put gangs into prison and we shall 
continue to do so. The decree is only of some help in this 
process," Gennadiy Chebotarev, first deputy head of the 
ministry's main department for combatting organised crime, told 
the newspaper. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with Valeriy 
Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security 
Council, who believes that the following levels of security 
exist: "The security of the individual, the security of society, 
the security of the state. But still the safety of the 
individual is most important and is the point of departure". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Oleg Gaydanov, deputy 
prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation, who told the 
newspaper: "The presidential decree dated June 14, I should say, 
is viewed in the prosecutor's office in varied ways, too. Some 
measures provided for in the decree really run counter to the 
current legislation. But one must realise that the problems of 
combatting crime are now uppermost in the minds of people in 
Russia and worry them more than any other one". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with two candidates 
for 
the Ukrainian presidency -- the incumbent President Leonid 
Kravchuk and ex-Premier Leonid Kuchma. 
  "I am convinced that whoever becomes a president of Ukraine 
he, and together with him the whole of Ukraine, will always be 
in a hard situation if he would fail to proceed from the premise 
that relations with Russia should have a special status, 
considering the past and the future ..." Kravchuk told the 
newspaper. 
  "If we learned to respect each other, then 70 per cent of 
our 
problems would have been resolved. Therefore relations with 
Russia are the most important matter, the centerpiece in our 
policy", Kravchuk said. 
  Kuchma stated, for his part: "I have believed and continue 
to 
believe that we have many common interests on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union. As far as trips abroad are concerned, 
one should travel and have contacts with those countries which 
want that". 
  Touching upon the Black Sea Fleet issue, Kuchma emphasised: 
"The problem, to my mind, has long been resolved by the present 
government. One should come to see what the solution is. We 
really need to undo this Black Sea knot. Otherwise, someone 
will always play this card in relations between Ukraine and 
Russia". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports that "the military collegium of 
the Russian Federation Supreme Court has referred an application 
from former Soviet Deputy Minister of Defence Valentin 
Varennikov to the Russian prosecutor-general's office for the 
institution of criminal proceedings in connection with the fact 
of `the break-up of the USSR'. Varennikov's defence lawyer 
Dmitriy Shteynberg, who announced this, pointed out that in 
accordance with law the prosecutor's office should verify the 
application and decide on or deny the institution of criminal 
proceedings". Varennikov was a defendant at the coup plotters' 
trial. 
  PRAVDA writes that "now, just as two years ago, the question 
of Lithuanian investigators' possible taking of testimony from 
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has re-emerged. They 
are convinced, the newspaper RESPUBLIKA reported, that Gorbachev 
was well informed of a conspiracy being prepared in Lithuania 
and did not stand aloof from the developments'. Referring to 
well-informed sources, the newspaper maintains that `an official 
charge against Gorbachev may be formulated in the coming days'". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, referring to the opinion of Vice- 
Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, writes that gross production of 
grain in Russia this year is expected to amount to 90-95 million 
tonnes, which will make it possible not to purchase grain abroad. 
  TRUD carries an article by Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's 
Democratic Choice Party, who writes: "We are for a party of 
clean hands. This is what all politicians say. But it seems to 
me that we have real grounds to say that. At all events, I do 
not know who from among our active workers was accused of 
corruption if only once. 
  "Those democratic politicians whose reputation was not 
impeccable, quit Russia's Choice or from the very outset were 
members of other parties. On the other hand, our party is 
supported by those who are known as decent people, who did not 
pursue big money and high positions and who were even ready to 
go to prison for their convictions." 
  TRUD carries in interview with Ranendra Sena, the Indian 
ambassador to the Russian Federation, who said "We should not 
limit our relations to trade. It is essential to develop 
lasting and mutually beneficial partnership, establishing 
co-production, combining technological resources, creating 
common managerial structures and studying the market." 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Admiral of the Fleet 
Ivan Kapitanets, who points out: "We intend to uphold the 
interests of the fleet through the Federal Assembly. Our task 
is to convince the deputies, government and president that fleet 
expenditure should be separated from the all-budget one and turn 
it into a separate purpose-oriented item. A state programme 
should be worked out for the development of the fleet 15-20 
years ahead. Without that, the fleet would not simply survive". 
  PRAVDA carries a statement by the State Duma group of the 
Communist Party of the Russian Federation, on the 1994 budget 
issue. The statement reads as follows: "The members of the 
Communist Party group in the state Duma believe that the 1994 
draft budget submitted by the government, even after the 
introduction of some amendments to it, firstly, does not meet 
the interests of the people and the country. Secondly, it does 
not promote the country's getting out of the economic crisis 
and, thirdly, it has no clear priorities and is not aimed at 
providing the social protection of the population or 
strengthening the country's defence capacity".

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Nadein: "Premier Chernomyrdin's Visit </F>
to the United States Went Even Better Than Expected"] 
  [Text] Washington -- On completing the main, Washington 
section of his visit to the United states, Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin described it as extremely 
successful, and the figures bear out this assessment. 
<H5>  The Visit in Figures </H5>
  $400 million is the cost of the joint work on a space 
station. U.S. Vice President Al Gore said at a press conference 
on Thursday that Russian participation will make the project 
"better, cheaper, and quicker." Stressing another aspect, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said that Russians "are not doing anyone 
favors," inasmuch as we have managed to get a decent price for 
our endeavors. But the main point clearly is that money to keep 
our space industry as a going concern will continue to come in 
from the United States. 
  The overall cost of the project, according to the 
pessimists, 
is $30 billion. The pessimists in the House of Representatives 
numbered 215 -- that's a pretty large number, but it was one 
less than the optimists, and that proved sufficient for the 
project to start to implemented. 
  $820 million is the promised and repromised money for 
systemic transformations which was allocated Russia in Tokyo one 
year ago, but it has all been deferred because of inflation and 
delays with reforms. The World Bank is now granting the money 
and promises to allocate even more -- all of it, of course, has 
to be repaid. 
  The IMF has allocated $300 for highway repairs, $200 million 
for the development of Russian banks, $240 million for private 
farms, and $80 million for measures connected with land reform. 
Is it necessary to remind people that the IMF -- a purely 
commercial organization -- grants money for projects which it 
regards as promising and will recover it all with interest -- by 
hook or by crook. 
  These are all sizable figures, but they are not the biggest. 
That comes next. 
<H5>  $9 billion and 10 Affable Jews </H5>
  The Russian premier began his stay in Washington with a 
problem that he had never dealt with in his life and ended it 
with a matter that he has dealt with throughout his life. It is 
rare occurrence when such diverse questions are so closely 
linked. 
  The premier began his visit with a meeting with leaders of 
American Jewry. This happened immediately after his arrival -- 
this meeting, which was certainly scheduled in advance, was not 
announced on the itinerary of the visit and was known to only a 
very restricted circle of people in the embassy. 
  During the course of the 90-minute meeting the 10 delegates 
from the National Conference on Soviet Jewry asked the head of 
government the most varied questions connected with the 
emigration of fellow-Jews who want to leave Russia and with 
ensuring a decent life for those who wish to remain there. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin showed patience, gave exhaustive 
answers, and was well disposed toward them. He gave assurances 
regarding the small number of refuseniks (less than a dozen) who 
have not obtained the right to leave because of their access, 
according to the Russian authorities, to state secrets. He 
outlined a government program to combat anti-Semitism. He 
promised close cooperation wiith Israel's ministries of culture 
and national education [as published] in drawing up appropriate 
programs in Russia. 
  In short, the premier so pleased his interlocutors that they 
promised him their full support and subsequently themselves 
telephoned various news agencies to ensure that they reflected 
the deep satisfaction felt by these influential representatives 
of an influential community at their meeting with the premier of 
the new Russia. 
  A meeting immediately followed with former Congressman 
Vanik, 
coauthor with legislator Jackson, now deceased, of the 
well-known amendment which bears their names. The Jackson-Vanik 
Amendment, which became law at the height of the Cold War, 
forbids the granting of most-favored nation status to a country 
where human rights are violated in the form of people being 
prevented from leaving the state. 
  Given that it is not difficult to leave Russia now, the 
codrafter of the law recognized it was obsolete. As a 
high-ranking member of the delegation reported, "Vanik said that 
he now regrets having proposed such a law." 
  Although there is more politeness than truth in that remark, 
the problem is now becoming both more serious and bizarre. 
  If present-day Russia maintains its course, the U.S. 
president will certainly extend most-favored nation status each 
year. This will virtually have no effect on many kinds of 
commercial exchange. 
  However, ultralarge, long-term investment becomes a 
top-level 
matter so long as the amendment is not repealed. No one wants 
to risk many billions of dollars which may turn a profit only 
after decades. The advent of a new government -- and not just 
in Russia but in the United States too -- becomes potentially 
dangerous. 
  It is very difficult to change laws in America. It is 
difficult to pass them. It is difficult to repeal them. 
Thousands of proposed amendments remain simply vain endeavors, 
mustering just one or two votes. 
  But laws are repealed by the same procedure. And that is why 
Viktor Chernomyrdin needs not just the sympathy but the active 
help of the Jewish community in the United States to repeal the 
Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The community put immense effort into 
getting it passed at the time. Today the Russian premier, 
acting in a completely new sphere for him, is doing his utmost 
to ensure that the Jews of America help Moscow, as they did 
during War II. 
  The delegates of the Jewish community promised to do this 
after their uplifting meeting with him, which is why the work 
with which Chernomyrdin has been professionally occupied all his 
life has now become realizable in practice. 
  During his last visit here last September the Russian 
premier, who is a gas and oil industry man by profession, 
devoted a lot of time to the Marathon Oil company. This oil 
concern -- a pretty major company, albeit not a giant -- enjoyed 
his special attention during his visit to Houston, Texas. Some 
Russian experts claimed at the time that Marathon was developing 
a very profitable project for Russia involving work at Sakhalin. 
  Marathon has now become the leading company in the Sakhalin 
Energy Investment consortium, which is investing #9 billion in 
developing the Sakhalin shelf, with its rich reserves of oil and 
natural gas. 
  In the opinion of experts from the Chernomyrdin-Gore group, 
total U.S. investment, which now stands at approximately $1 
billion, will grow to $40-50 billion by the end of the decade. 
  True to himself, the prime minister preferred to talk about 
the economy, but you can't escape politics in his job. 
Moreover, the meeting with Clinton took place the day after the 
signing of the agreement with NATO in Brussels -- you couldn't, 
in general, devise a better situation. 
  But the premier himself has been persistent in creating an 
atmosphere of openness, friendship, and understanding that a 
partner has national interests; and most importantly, whether 
assenting or dissenting, he has sought to speak the same 
language in both politics and economics. 
  Only one sticky moment arose. On Thursday, from early 
morning on, all Washington political circles were discussing an 
article in THE NEW YORK TIMES claiming that the Russian 
Government is not providing full information on work on chemical 
weapons, that is to say, improvement of binary gases is 
continuing, and that the revelations by the chemist Vil 
Mirzoyanov, whom the Russian authorities -- with staggering 
clumsiness -- tried to imprison, are confirmed by other sources 
at CIA and military department level. 
  Nevertheless, CIA Director R. James Woolsey and Joint Chiefs 
of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili advised the legislators to 
ratify the treaty on the prohibition of chemical weapons. And 
although doubts among the congressmen are considerable, the 
majority do seem inclined to ratify it if Russia is more frank 
and honest in furnishing information. 
  Whether Chernomyrdin failed to be briefed by his aides or 
whether he himself failed to pay heed (perhaps out of dear 
Moscow habit he thought it doesn't matter what they write in the 
newspapers there), his answer at the press conference was 
brusque but unconvincing: This is all nonsense born of utter 
ignorance. 
  That may be the case, of course. However, in America they 
have somehow gotten used to the idea that if THE NEW YORK TIMES, 
the CIA, and the Defense Department make a claim it is better to 
attempt to rebut it with more proof and less emotion. 
  Vice President Al Gore hurried to help out his colleague and 
cochairman, suggesting that in Moscow, unlike Washington, the 
top leaders don't have time to read the newspapers first thing 
in the morning. 
  But that was merely a sideshow. On the whole, the current 
premier, who, even one year ago frightened capitalist-raised 
kids here, has proved to be fully deserving of the assessments 
which World Bank President Jacques Camdessus [name and title as 
published] brought back from Moscow in the spring. 
  In a number of interviews and private discussions Jacques 
Camdessus expressed complete satisfaction at not just his week 
spent in Moscow but -- most importantly -- the approach to the 
economic realities by the Russian premier himsslf. 
  Camdessus would most likely not have experienced such a 
happy 
shock had Gaydar still been in that high post. They had 
probably not expected from Chernomyrdin such commitment to tough 
monetarist policy, steadfastness in pursuing a market course, or 
readiness to crush all who stand in the way of the country's 
financial recovery. Had Camdessus understood the real meaning 
of the Soviet expression "our man," he might well have used it. 
  The World Bank president's views had merely grown stronger 
by 
the time of Viktor Chernomyrdin's arrival. Demonstrating in 
every possible way his support for Russia (for lack of which he 
severely criticized Vice President Al Gore and Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott), he said that Russia "is making 
determined efforts in favor of reforms and stabilizations." 
  Reflecting the growing opinion here that Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin has serious chances of becoming Boris Yeltsin's 
successor, the U.S. vice president said: "Mr. Chernomyrdin is a 
tremendous leader of Russia as regards the active implementation 
of reforms." 
  Relations between our countries do not simply develop 
dynamically, they also have their ups and their downs. It now 
looks as if the latest up following a down has begun. All 22 of 
the documents prepared in advance have been signed, including 
those regarding whose prospects very serious misgivings had been 
voiced. 
  For example, the treaty stopping the manufacture of 
plutonium 
looked to have slim chances of survival. Russia demanded 
compensation, the United States did not understand why, strictly 
speaking, it should pay, given that it is doing the same thing 
back home on a reciprocal basis. 
  They have agreed to an apparently strange compromise. The 
treaty was signed not by ministers, as envisaged, but at a 
higher level -- by Chernomyrdin and Gore. The United States 
won't give money for the shutdown of production. However, it 
will allocate $1 million for research work in two Russian 
scintific research institutes. 
  Of course, no single meeting clears up absolutely 
everything. 
The problems of chemical weapons remain for Naples, where Boris 
Yeltsin will go to talk with the G-7 leaders. Decisions are 
still awaited on the question of NATO, nearby foreign parts, 
peacemaking efforts, and so forth, on which neither side has 
given an exhaustive answer to date. And this is unlikely to 
emerge by September, when Boris Yeltsin will be coming to the 
United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Shapovalov: "Reading Between the </F>
Lines. Postscript to V. Chernomyrdin's Visit"] 
  [Text] There is an extremely fine line between politics 
and economics because the former, as is known, follows from the 
latter. It is not enough to assess the visit solely on the 
meetings with B. Clinton and other leading figures. We must 
also take account of the meetings at which at first sight 
inconspicuous yet essentially very important work was done, as 
evidenced by the avidity with which the interlocutors hung on 
every word spoken by the guest from Moscow. To this should also 
be added the contribution made by the six leading Russian 
Federation ministers who came to Washington to participate in 
the third session of the Russian-U.S. Intergovernmental 
Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation (this gave 
observers cause to joke that an away session of the Russian 
Government was being held in America). 
  The Americans seemed to be most interested in one thing: 
What was happening in Russia at this moment, and whether the 
guests would be so bold as to speak again about the allocation 
of aid, on which the limit, even the verbal limit -- this was 
not concealed in Washington -- has already been reached. 
Instead, advice was offered about "living according to our 
means" and about cooperation in the spheres of space 
exploration, nuclear power, and environmental protection. 
  Portraying the present situation in Russia, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin strengthened the Americans' faith in the reforms 
being implemented in our country. At the same time he made it 
clear (unobtrusively) that the results might have been still 
more tangible but for "Cold War relics" -- restrictions of 
various kinds. Thus, the development of bilateral trade 
relations is being held up not so much by the uncompetitiveness 
of many Russian commodities as by obstacles in the United States 
in the way of high-tech products coming from Russia. The cause 
of this -- tough antidumping legislation -- was not only named. 
V. Chernomyrdin called for the repeal of the notorious 
Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Bill and also for the U.S. 
Administration to recognize Russia's status as a country with a 
transitional market economy. 
  At the same time he stated this not just at the highest 
level. The premier ventured to do something that no Soviet or 
Russian leading figure has done before: to have a meeting with 
the leadership of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry -- the 
very body on whose initiative the Jackson-Vanik Amendment was, 
in fact, approved. The unusual approach was repaid with 
interest. The representatives of the "influential Zionist 
lobby" in the United States (this was what they were called 
under the totalitarian regime) listened to the premier with 
interest and promised assistance but, at the same time, did not 
conceal their concern about the growth of crime and acts of 
anti-Semitism in Russia. Chernomyrdin in turn promised effective 
government assistance in settling problems, while emphasizing, 
however, that political stabilization is inconceivable without 
economic stabilization, particularly the repeal of the 
Jackson-Vanik Amendment. 
  It would evidently be naive to think that the various kinds 
of unevenness in Russian-U.S. relations will be eliminated at 
once. A number of congressmen, for example, dislike the fact 
that almost 20 documents on bilateral cooperation signed in the 
United States include an agreement to include Russia in the 
international program to build the Alpha space station: They 
say that this will entail U.S. expenditure.

  [Text] The working visit of General George Joulwan, 
commander- in-chief of NATO forces in Europe, to Russia began on 
Monday. 
  Officials in the Russian Defense Ministry's press and 
information service told Interfax that Joulwan would meet with 
National Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, First Deputy 
Minister Oleg Soskovets, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, 
chief of the General Staff, and MPs on June 27. 
  Joulwan's meeting with Army General Pavel Grachev, the 
Russian Defense Minister, and a joint news conference with him 
are scheduled for Tuesday. 
  Other plans for his stay in Russia include a meeting with 
ambassadors of NATO member nations in Moscow and a visit to the 
27th Separate Motorized Brigade stationed in Teplyy Stan, a 
southern neighborhood of Moscow. 
  Observers believe that the Joulwan visit reflects closer 
ties 
between Russia and NATO. Russian diplomats told Interfax that 
the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev had signed a 
protocol on working out a Russia-NATO cooperation program 
simultaneously with the Partnership for Peace framework program. 
The two sides are said in the protocol to have agreed to 
continue broad Russian-NATO cooperation both inside and outside 
the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Russia and NATO also agreed to continue a dialog on both 
political and security problems in Europe, political 
consultations and cooperation on security. 
  Russian diplomats pointed out that the very fact of signing 
the protocol implied the existence of special relations between 
the North Atlantic Alliance and Russia.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- First Vice-Premier of the 
Russian Government Oleg Soskovets and commander-in-chief of 
NATO's joint armed forces in Europe, George Joulwan, currently 
on a visit to Russia in the framework of cooperation between 
Russia and NATO, came out for the expansion of cooperation 
between Russia and the North Atlantic alliance. 
  During their meeting today, the first Russian vice-premier 
said the "world community pins its hopes on Russia, the United 
States and NATO for the maintenance of world peace." Soskovets 
pointed out that the participation of Russian peace-keeping 
forces in Yugoslavia and Georgia shows that "Russia is making 
considerable efforts for promoting peace." Besides, Russia is 
responsible for the protection of borders in Tajikistan, 
prevention of conflicts in the Caucasus and keeping the 
situation on Moldova under control, Soskovets added. 
  He drew attention to the fact that Russia, in fact, has been 
carrying out complex and unilateral conversion practically 
without any assistance by foreign partners. He pointed out that 
"the policy of conversion would be continued in accordance with 
Russia's military doctrine." 
  For his part, the NATO commander said that after the sides 
had signed the partnership for peace programme, possibilities 
opened for developing closer contacts. Joulwan said that the 
Partnership for Peace is "a road with two-way traffic." It is 
not only Russia that can learn something from NATO, but NATO can 
take over much of Russia's experience, Joulwan said. "The time 
has come to work out concrete documents determining the degree 
of Russia's participation in NATO's programmes," the NATO 
official said.

  [Text] The fact that NATO's Partnership for Peace program 
has already become part of Russian policy was confirmed today at 
a meeting between Oleg Soskovets and George Joulwan, NATO's 
commander in chief in Europe. In a conversation with the U.S. 
general, the first deputy prime minister noted that the CIS 
countries have not become really independent since gaining 
political independence. In the Caucasus, Tajikistan, and 
Moldova, Russia is forced to conduct peacekeeping missions. 
Moreover, it hopes for assistance in these operations from the 
North Atlantic alliance. 
  The NATO commander in chief agreed with the first deputy 
prime minister's assessment of the situation in CIS trouble 
spots, and stressed that NATO is undergoing a period of 
transformation from a military bloc into a peacekeeping one. 
However, it is in no haste to participate in such operations. 
George Joulwan proposed to Oleg Soskovets that joint 
Russian-NATO exercises be held in any European country of 
Russia's choice and at a time convenient to it. Russia agrees 
in principle. The details will evidently be discussed tomorrow 
at George Joulwan's meeting with [Defense Minister] Pavel 
Grachev.

  [Text] Those members of the State Duma who on June 22 said 
in parliament that Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace 
betrays national interests are traitors themselves, the Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today. He was speaking 
before his meeting in Moscow with the Commander-in-Chief of 
NATO's allied forces in Europe George Joulwan. 
  "They are political red-brown bastards who want to plunge 
Russia into isolation again. They need an enemy", Kozyrev said. 
  He said that Russia would in any case take a decent place in 
the world and would most probably hold a joint military exercise 
with the United States. "We've got nothing to be afraid of. On 
the contrary, a refusal would be tantamount to sticking one's 
head in the sand", he said 
  About the conflict in the Balkans Kozyrev said that uneasy 
calm had been established there and that it was still fraught 
with a slide into World War III. 
  He said that the "parties of war" in the Balkans were trying 
to win support from the great powers and as a matter of fact 
provoking a collision between them. 
  Kozyrev said that Russia was for addressing both sides with 
a 
firm demand to observe peace without giving preferences to 
either of them. 
  "Those traitors in the Duma who demand supporting one of the 
parties thereby push us into a war with the United States. 
"Apparently they would like to fish in troubled waters, just as 
was the case in 1917, and Mr Ziuganov seeks to outdo his 
predecessor".

  [Text] Moscow, 27 June -- Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
trenchantly rejected State Duma attempts on 22 June to question 
the legitimacy of Russia signing NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program. On that day, the communists' faction called for the 
signing of this document "to be deemed invalid," comparing it 
with the "Barbarossa Plan," under which Hitler invaded the USSR. 
  In the words of the minister, who stressed that he was 
speaking as a deputy of the lower house of parliament, "It was 
simply the voice of traitors" speaking at that 22 June session 
of the State Duma. A group of politicians, he went on, took the 
liberty of speaking utterly disgracefully. It appears that some 
people would like to revive the image of the enemy. "We are 
talkin here of red- brown [communist-fascist] political 
mongrels. The communists left millions of people to rot in 
camps and the fascists killed millions of people." 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that "one of the parties involved in all 
of this or, rather, its faction in the State Duma, enjoys 
material and organizational support from neofascists in the 
Federal Republic of Germany." It is no coincidence, he added, 
that "in his book, Zhirinovskiy proposes giving away Russian 
lands--Vyborg and Kaliningrad.... This is probably his German 
neofascist friends ordering the return of Russian lands, the 
trade in Russian lands." 
  Noting that he will answer for his words, the minister said: 
"I do not think this is the stance of the faction, but it is the 
stance of certain politicians. This is treachery against 
Russia, and it was this that came from the red-browns on 22 
June." 
  In the minister's words, Russia is building partnership 
relations, based on equality, dignity and, acknowledgement of 
its role as a great power, both in the West and the East. 
Everyone is well aware that our cooperation with NATO is an 
element of a global picture. It represents no threat at all to 
our neighbors. On the contrary, it is an element of improvement 
and cooperation, Andrey Kozyrev added.

  [Text] "Whenever something serious and positive happens in 
Russia's foreign policy, it invariably causes somebody's 
criticism,, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
has told IF. He was speaking in reply to the opposition 
leaders' strong criticism of Russia's joining the NATO 
"Partnership for Peace" program. 
  The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the 
program in Brussels last Wednesday. The "Russia-NATO" protocol 
was adopted on the same day. "This is a serious, important 
step" Panov said. 
  He believes that criticism expressed over the past few days 
was counterproductive, because it contained no alternative or 
any other proposals. "They (the opposition - IF) simply don't 
like it. Probably, this is inevitable when political struggle is 
afoot. But criticism must be well-founded. Otherwise it is 
just not serious at all," Panov said.

<F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F>
Week" rubric: "The Time for Real Partnership Has Come. And Not 
Only With the West"] 
  [Text] "To heed the call of the future" -- Boris Pasternak 
considered this essential for a poet. Likewise, the ability to 
pick up signals for the future in rapidly changing situations 
and on a daily basis, is the most important quality for someone 
in politics. I do not think I will go far wrong if I say that 
this week, for Russia, this call of the future was concentrated 
in the word "integration." At the same time, there were precise 
manifestations of two integrative aspects which, in my view, 
will also determine Moscow's policy in the foreseeable future. 
  First and foremost, it is a matter of our country's further 
accession to the global economic system now emerging, the 
guarantee of Russia's maximum participation in the formation of 
European and world security. And here, some highly important 
steps were taken. Above all, the matter concerns the agreement 
signed by Boris Yeltsin in Corfu on cooperation between Russia 
and the European Union [EU]. After that -- the formalization of 
Moscow's relations with NATO, which took place in Brussels. 
  These days, the demand for integration on another level made 
itself heard in the most insistent manner. It cannot but be 
noted that the pivotal question of the presidential election 
campaigns both in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] (and it is 
highly noteworthy that the matter concerns republics whose 
leaders finalized the disintegration of the Union in 1991) was 
the question of reintegration with Russia. 
  However, listening to an insistent demand resounding from 
the 
future is only half the task for a politician. The newspaper 
SEGODNYA recalled an extraordinary incident which occurred in 
the sphere of Russian diplomacy almost two centuries ago. Soon 
after the conclusion of the Tilsit Peace, it emerged that France 
had no intention of honoring the commitments which Napoleon had 
given in a conversation with Alexander I. In response to 
Russia's protests, a cynical Talleyrand replied: "Politics is 
just like music. A tune which has not been inscribed on paper, 
and a tune which has not been determined in note form, is no 
more than an empty noise." But the role of a politician is to 
transform trends favorable to his country into specific 
treaties, into a clearly prescribed position. 
  However, this is something we succeed in doing far from 
always, and with great difficulty. It is no coincidence that it 
took so long -- almost two years -- to elaborate the agreement 
with the EU. After all, unlike a similar agreement signed in 
1989 with the USSR, it enshrines not just general principles, 
and not just wishful thinking about cooperation. It is a matter 
of specific economic commitments. The key provision is the 
possibility of free trade between the EU and Russia as of 1998. 
The fact is that by contrast with, say, Ukraine, Russia is 
deemed to be a country with a transition economy. This gives it 
the opportunity, in relations with West European partners, to 
obtain the very same benefits which are enjoyed by states within 
the GATT framework. At the same time, the EU "has understood 
the position" of Russia and agreed that it can continue to 
protect the most socially vulnerable spheres with the aid of 
tariffs and import duties for a certain amount of time. 
  Each of the agreement's signatories had to traverse his own 
section of the road to reach it. EU countries were able, for 
the sake of strengthening stability in Europe, to fight the 
egotistical urge not to allow foreign goods onto their own 
markets. Moscow agreed that various restrictions will operate 
for certain categories of goods and services (textiles, steel, 
aluminum, fissionable materials, commercial use of launch 
vehicles). It would be too optimistic to state that efforts to 
isolate us are a thing of the past. This is proved not only by 
the restrictions which have been retained, but also by the fact 
that Russia is not seen as one of the countries earmarked for 
admission to the EU (where room has been found for the East 
European states.) 
  Less obvious is the success in establishing genuine 
partnership relations with NATO. Ultimately, Moscow, as 
promised, signed a framework document on NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" program. And, in my view, this will bring our country 
nothing but good, no matter what fairy tales Russian 
conservatives may be conjuring up on this score. Admittedly, 
Russia failed to attain the formalization of relations with the 
North Atlantic Alliance which would have corresponded to its 
role as a nuclear state exerting a definite influence on 
European and world security. It had to be satisfied that the 
possibility of setting special terms beyond the framework of the 
"partnership" program is enshrined in the protocol on the 
results of the discussion between the Russian Federation foreign 
minister and the North Atlantic Council. The protocol is no 
more than a very vague melody, which has yet to be painstakingly 
transformed into a "tune" of specific agreements and mutual 
commitments by our diplomats and our military, and their NATO 
colleagues alike. 
  But be that as it may, this integrative aspect looks very 
specific. If only because Moscow's aims here, as a rule, are 
obvious both to Moscow itself and to its partners. The picture 
regarding relations with the former Soviet republics, where the 
question of the fundamental reinforcement of relations with 
Russia has already been placed on the agenda, looks different 
altogether. Just as, three years ago, some politicians tried to 
use to their ends the aspiration for sovereignization which 
suddenly overwhelmed their peoples, today others are trying to 
harness the trend toward reintegration. The Belorussian 
[Belarusian] premier's lightning visit to Moscow on the very eve 
of the presidential elections clearly had the purpose of 
demonstrating to the people this very contender's special 
relations with Russia. This is not the only example. 
  Meanwhile, in Russia itself, isolationist ideas are 
spreading 
widely, their thrust being that it is not worth our weak, but 
not defunct economy's taking on the burden of other states' 
problems. Official Moscow is still playing a waiting game, 
preferring that its partners themselves should define the level 
and nature of the relations they would like to have with Russia. 
  This was the only possible approach yesterday, in the period 
of sovereignization panic. But today, the time has come to 
formulate more clearly just what Russia's state policy is on 
this issue. Does Moscow want a new and closer association than 
the CIS presupposes? If so, then on what terms in the sphere of 
politics, economics, and security guarantees could this come 
about? A clear position here is important not least because it 
will block the road to demagogues and political speculators. 
The collapse of the Union created difficulties for the millions 
and millions of family and friendship links. It is this, in the 
experts' view, which became one of the main reasons for the 
terrible economic slump. And now, when the task ahead is, if 
not to halt this slump, then at least to slow it down, the issue 
of restoring old relations on a new and mutually advantageous 
basis appears pertinent to the highest degree. 
  Many people in the West understand the need for this. At the 
very least, the agreement between Russia and the EU provides for 
preserving preferential economic regimes in relations with 
Moscow and CIS countries. "Russia's future might will depend 
upon its ability to guarantee security and its own influence 
everywhere where geography offers such a possibility." This is 
the view of Helene Carrere d'Encosse, member of the Academie 
Francaise and a recognized expert in Russian affairs, which she 
expressed recently in LE FIGARO. It would seem that she has 
picked out the call of the future. The ball in in Moscow's 
court.

  [Text] A Chinese fishing boat was detained for illegally 
fishing in Russian territorial waters on Sunday. 
  The arrest follows an operation codenamed Zaslon against 
poaching and illegal border crossing, launched by the Far 
Eastern Border District last Thursday. 
  The amount of fines imposed on Russian and foreign vessels 
since the launching of the operation runs at Rbl 1 billion. 
More than Rbl 230 million worth of smuggled goods were seized 
and 38 people, most of them Chinese, were detained for illegal 
border crossing. 
  Out of 36 Russian vessels inspected, one was impounded on 
charges of trying to smuggle out a load of non-ferrous metal and

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Assessing the prospects for the 
Russian Government's proposal to hold an international 
conference on security on the Korean peninsula and nuclear-free 
status for it, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov 
said that "if the current bilateral contacts between the United 
States and North Korea fail, there will be no alternative." 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, he described the chances for 
this Russian initiative as "very strong." The diplomat believes 
that if the bilateral dialogue between the United States and the 
DPRK fails, it will become clear that "our position is 
absolutely right," since it is based on common sense. 
  Aleksandr Panov considers that the consultations between the 
United States and the DPRK, between North and South Korea, and 
between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] could be rolled into one. "Our proposed format is the 
best way of going about this," he noted. 
  Russia, he said, now believes that the number of 
participants 
in the conference on Korea could be increased. He said that, in 
addition to the DPRK and the Republic of Korea, it could be 
attended by the United States, Japan, Russia, China, and 
representatives of the United Nations and the IAEA, as well as 
Britain and France. France has already expressed a wish to take 
part. "We have always said that our proposal is not something 
sacrosanct," the Russian diplomat said, adding that each party 
is free to express its feelings and additional suggestions as 
regards the conference idea. 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula deteriorated after the 
DPRK announced it was leaving the IAEA and that it might also 
withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Valiyev] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, 27 Jun -- Despite the DPRK's departure 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the 
monitoring equipment installed by the agency at the North Korean 
nuclear facilities at the village of Yongbyong, 100 km from 
Pyongyang, is working normally. 
  This was stated today in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent by Choe Chong-Sun, chief of the external affairs 
administration of the Committee for Atomic Energy of the DPRK. 
If anything is required to be replaced in the course of the 
operation of this equipment, we will consult the IAEA, he 
pointed out. In addition, two of the agency's inspectors remain 
on the territory of the republic. They are, it is true, leaving 
the DPRK tomorrow, but there are two experts coming to replace 
them on the same day who will continue the inspection work. 
Representatives of North Korea also remain in Vienna, where the 
IAEA headquarters are located. 
  In the words of Choe Chong-sun, as before, the DPRK still 
does not pin especial hopes on cooperation with the IAEA. He 
estimated the agency's aid to Pyongyang last year at $500,000 in 
the field of agriculture, medicine and the manufacture of 
certain goods. 
  The main aim of the reactor in Yongbyob, constructed with 
the 
close cooperation of the former USSR, is the development of 
nuclear energy to supply the requirements for developing the 
national economy, and the DPRK government is conducting an 
immutable policy in this respect, he said. This type of 
graphite reactor is the most rational for the country's 
conditions, since the country possesses reserves of uranium and 
graphite. 
  To clear suspicion, the DPRK last year put forward in talks 
with the United States the idea of replacing the present reactor 
with a light water reactor. But the main aim is nevertheless 
not the reactor itself, Choe Chong-sun stressed, but the 
country's being fully supplied with electricity. In the present 
conditions we simply cannot help using the existing 5-megawatt 
reactor for our own needs, he pointed out. 
  Naturally, the USSR provided assistance in the construction 
of the reactor, but in its successor -- Russia -- there is now a 
difficult situation, so the republic does not pin especial hopes 
on it in this matter, he said. I think, Cho'e Cong-sun noted, 
that we now have hardly any cooperation with Russia in the 
nuclear field. 
  Nor, he said, is Pyongyang especially counting on other 
countries in the matter of creating a light water reactor or in 
the field of nuclear experts. All the work is being carried out 
by Korean scientists. Overall, the DPRK does not feel any 
special technological need to replace the reactor and is making 
such plans only in order to remove from itself the suspicion of 
secret development of nuclear weapons, he announced. 
  Choe Chong-sun announced that the DPRK has plutonium, which 
is used for experimental purposes in the radio chemistry 
laboratory in Yongbyon, but he did not name the existing 
quantity. 
  Concluding the conversation, he expressed indignation at 
what 
in his view is the false coverage of the North Korean nuclear 
program by the Western mass information media.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Shalnev: "One Billion Dollars in </F>
Investments Is Not Enough for Russia: The Consultative Council 
Is Hoping To Radically Change the Situation"] 
  [Text] Just $1 billion -- that is the expected volume of 
direct foreign investments in the Russian economy this year. 
According to Yakov Urinson, first deputy economy minister, this 
is even less than in Estonia, which is a "very small country." 
  In an attempt to stimulate interest among investors -- both 
Western and Eastern -- in Russia, a Consultative Council for 
Foreign Investments is being created under the Russian 
Government and will hold its first session in Moscow next Monday 
under the chairmanship of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The leaders of 
14 large corporations which either already are investing money 
in our economy or are intending to do so have been invited onto 
the council, whose main function, as far as may be judged from 
comments by government spokesmen, will be to outline or adjust 
the general course and strategy of Russia's investment policy. 
  There is, of course, a certain risk that the council may be 
turned into a powerful grouping, which will promote the 
interests of the corporations represented on it. But in 
conversation with journalists Urinson ruled that risk out, 
stressing that the council's activity "will not be dedicated to 
specific investment projects but will be concentrated solely on 
questions of principle." 
  It is expected that at the first session the Russian 
Government will unveil a set of measures designed to increase 
the influx of foreign money. The plan will include among other 
things draft amendments to the recent law on foreign 
investments, which, from the Moscow White House viewpoint, is 
not entirely adequate to our present-day economic realities. It 
is not impossible that the plan will finally answer the question 
which is being actively debated in the government itself and 
outside it, namely whether it is worth creating special 
conditions for foreign investors. In the view of the deputy 
minister of the economy (his "personal" view, as he stressed), 
"this hardly neerds to be done." I wonder whether his opinion 
will prove decisive. 
  One final point: There is clearly some irony in the fact 
that the U.S. banking corporation, Citicorp, figures among the 
council's members. This corporation, which is undoubtedly a 
major potential investor, is affected by the restrictions 
contained in the president's edicts on the activities of foreign 
banks in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yu.P. Makarov, commander of </F>
Separate Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle 
Guards' Brigade of Russian Armed Forces, by Aleksandr Polotskiy 
of RIA NOVOSTI under the "Out-of-Turn Parade" rubric; place and 
date not given: "Russia, Dismiss! With Belongings! May 1945: 
They Came. June 1994: They Left"] 
  [Text] Today, 25 June, the farewell parade of the Separate 
Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle Guards' 
Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces will take place in the 
capital of Germany. Our correspondent met with Major General 
Yuriy Petrovich Makarov, its commander. 
  [Polotskiy] The allies left with music, riding on combat 
hardware. But we? 
  [Makarov] Ten T-80 tanks are ready for the parade, but the 
German authorities are very afraid for "the asphalt and the road 
markings," which they might damage, and also for the streetcar 
lines, of which there are rather a lot in this part of East 
Berlin. Some six weeks ago, however, when a brigade of the 
French armed forces took its leave of the city folk in the 
environs of its Berlin garrison, the French drove not even 10 
but a whole 30 of their tanks into the streets -- the world was 
not turned upside down. Berliners gave the French military a 
very benevolent welcome. 
  [Polotskiy] Is the motherland ready to receive you? 
  [Makarov] We will send all our combat hardware and armament 
to Russia before 5 July, and all the families will leave before 
1 August. Only servicemen who will participate in the final 
ceremonial send-off of the Russian troops from Germany, 
scheduled for 31 August in the presence of President B. Yeltsin 
and Chancellor H. Kohl, will remain in Berlin. We will set out 
in two trains for the motherland, for Russia, 1 and 2 September. 
A ceremonial welcome for the Berlin Brigade is already 
scheduled for 3 September in Moscow and for 4 September in Kursk. 
  I will state frankly that we have been very lucky with our 
new stationing location -- housing for officers is already ready 
for us there, and there is a barracks for soldiers. We are 
taking with us another two prefabricated-panel barracks, which 
will house the medical unit and the staff, and we are reckoning 
on settling in entirely normally in the new place by fall or the 
beginning of winter. A Turkish firm is constructing a military 
camp there with 1,326 apartments, schools, clubs, and an 
artificial reservoir with funds taken from the sum of 7.8 
billion marks allocated by the FRG Government. 
  [Polotskiy] In conclusion: Yuriy Petrovich, which of the 
Russian servicemen, nonetheless, will be the last to leave 
Berlin? 
  [Makarov] We are people who respect both ourselves and 
others. Therefore, in order to leave the garrison in Karlshorst 
clean and in full order, we propose to entrust this work to a 
special recultivation group from our brigade. It will consist 
of up to one company. This group will have through 5 September 
to "tidy the apartment" being left to its owners.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Krasulin: "Corfu Is Just the </F>
Beginning"] 
  [Text] The results of Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin's visit to the Greek island of Corfu and the agreement 
with the European Union which he signed there are being actively 
discussed in the West. 
  The agreement should be welcomed in every way, since it will 
help to "civilize" Russian exports and will promote Western 
capital investment in the Russian economy. This opinion was 
expressed with typically English restraint by British Prime 
Minister John Major. 
  A more frank and optimistic assessment of this event was 
given by FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker. "The spirit of 
unity which has been established in Europe testifies that the 
Cold War era will never return," he said. 
  On the whole, the tone of the statements by all the EU 
representatives was almost wholly positive. Only journalists 
expressed a certain skepticism. Thus THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, 
while noting that the agreement will undoubtedly facilitate 
European capital investment in Russia, which is undergoing a 
severe economic crisis, at the same time reminds its readers 
that the document still has to be ratified. 
  Journalists accredited to the EU Council session noted that, 
despite the significance of all Russia's latest diplomatic 
steps, much mutual suspicion still remains in the new partners' 
relationship. Questions on which agreement has not yet been 
reached include Russian access to the European Investment Bank, 
the unconditional application of international rules in mutual 
trade, and the relaxation of visa regulations for Russians in EU 
countries. And the demand for the removal of restrictions on 
the activity of five Western banks on Russian Federation 
territory is hardly going to increase the optimism of Russian 
financiers. 
  But Britain's THE GUARDIAN notes that the resolution of 
virtually all international problems will be made easier for the 
Russian leadership by the fact that the West has staked too much 
to allow the risk of Russia's returning to isolation. 
  Russia will undoubtedly receive a number of benefits. Almost 
all Russian and Western observers incline to this conclusion. 
Above all, there is access to Western markets. But the Russian 
Federation has secured this access on the same terms as other 
countries whose economic development and cooperation led to the 
elaboration of today's market laws. Here a problem arises. The 
Russian economy urgently needs to reorient itself toward the 
harsh conditions of competition. Concessions should not be 
expected here. And observance of the strict norms in the EU's 
relations with other states in Europe is closely monitored, with 
a whole arsenal of punitive measures being used against 
offenders. Will Russia, with its current legislative chaos, be 
able to be a normal partner for the EU, and observe its own 
interests as well?

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Karen Markaryan: "Criminal Oil </F>
Pipeline"] 
  [Text] In the course of the investigation into the case of 
Ivan Kharitonov, one of the leaders of Latvia's criminal world, 
staffers involved in the struggle against organized crime 
uncovered the far from fictitious tentacles of the international 
mafia, which moves hundreds of thousands of tonnes of contraband 
petroleum products from Russia to the West. According to 
Latvian police estimates, Russia has lost as much as half a 
billion U.S. dolalrs in this way in the past 18 months. 
Latvia's losses resulting from illegal shipments of gasoline 
and diesel fuel through its territory are on a scale comparable 
to the republic's annual budget. 
  One of the main intermediaries is the Swedish-Latvian firm 
TESS Petroleum. During an investigation of this joint venture, 
a criminal business plan was uncovered. The mechanism is 
brilliantly simple. For example, the chief of a Kaliningrad 
trawler fleet base or the leader of a certain enterprise in that 
oblast suddenly rejects petroleum products that are in transit, 
using any excuse you like, and asks that the goods be 
readdressed to TESS Petroleum in Riga or some other front firm. 
Meanwhile a firm in Tallinn belonging to the TESS conglomerate 
has already paid for the petroleum products on the 
Kaliningraders' behalf. An order then comes down the Lithuanian 
Railroad, and the cargo turns around in mid-journey and goes to 
Latvia, from where it is most convenient to send the oil onward 
to the West by way of well equipped terminals. Naturally, nobody 
pays any dues for this devious transit route. And all the time 
Kaliningrad Oblast is suffering a constant fuel shortage. 
  The Latvian police alone do not have the resources for a 
detailed analysis of this "black-market bookkeeping." However, 
it is now quite clear that the roots should be sought in Moscow, 
at the highest government level. It was only from there that 
huge deliveries of petroleum products from various regions of 
Russia could have been organized and authorized. 
  The staffers of the Latvian MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] directorate for combating organized crime approached 
their Russian colleagues and provided them with copies of bank 
documents in which various Russian figures appear. However, 
nobody from Moscow has turned up. 
  "It seems our colleagues are simply afraid to take it on," a 
Latvian MVD staffer told me. "We know what a bombshell we have 
in our hands. And the criminals know it very well, too. I 
would not be surprised if they try to put a stop to the whole 
thing at the outset, and they will stop at nothing."

  [Text] The stretch of the Tajik-Afghan border patrolled by 
the Horog border detachment is recognized as the main gateway by 
which drugs enter the CIS. The border, which is almost 500 km 
long, runs between mountain ridges that separate Tajik and 
Afghan Badakhshan. Although all the outposts where the Russian 
border guards are based lie at the foot of these mountains, they 
are still at an altitude of 1,700-1,800 meters above sea level. 
You can imagine the hardships of service here, where Russian 
border guards have to cope with more than just the thin air of 
the Pamir mountains. Although political passions are now 
boiling in Tajik Badakhshan, on the Afghan side they have long 
escalated into armed settling of scores, and Russian border 
guards find themselves in the middle of all this. 
  [Begin recording] [A. Neroyev, commander of Horog border 
detachment] The fact that no single authority is in control on 
the territory of the neighboring state, Afghanistan, makes 
things difficult for us. On the other hand, the situation in 
Tajikistan itself is quite complex. So, the officers and men of 
the border troops have to work quite hard to keep the situation 
under control. Even so, we are actively guarding the border. We 
have regular meetings with Afghan representatives and settle 
security issues with them. We have been granted the right to 
represent the state in talks with the Afghans on questions 
involving the state border and control of the state border. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Marat Zubko: "Norwegians Remove Rubles From </F>
Circulation"] 
  [Text] Helsinki -- A large consignment of new coins 
totaling 22 million rubles [R] is on its way from the Svalbard 
Islands in the Arctic Ocean to Russia to be melted down! This 
money was minted on the islands specially for the Russian 
citizens working there. 
  Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago was established 
under the Svalbard Treaty (still known as the Paris treaty) of 
1920, but all the countries which signed it, and they now number 
40, received the right to conduct their own economic activity 
there. Representatives of a number of Russian organizations work 
on the islands, the largest of which is reckoned to be the 
Arktikugol Trust. 
  Some time ago the Arktikugol Trust, whose head office is in 
Moscow, introduced its own coins into circulation in 
denominations of R10, R25, R50, and R100 at the Barentsburg and 
Pyramiden mines on Svalbard. But the Norwegian authorities 
reacted extremely negatively to this move. 
  Since the words "Russian Federation" were stamped on the 
coins, Odd Blomdal, the Norwegian governor of the islands, 
thought that Moscow was thereby encroaching on Norwegian 
sovereignty over Svalbard. Representatives of the Russian 
embassy in Oslo were summoned to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, 
where they heard an expression of dissatisfaction at the 
Arktikugol Trust's action. After that, as I was told at the 
embassy, the money was taken out of circulation at Barentsburg 
and Pyramiden. 
  I phoned Barentsburg on Svalbard, where I spoke to Aleksandr 
Sokolov, director of the Arktikugol mine, and asked him to 
explain the reason for the introduction of the new coins. 
  "Inflation, of course," he replied. "Whereas before our 
local internal commodity turnover amounted to R400,000 a 
quarter, now it is running at 20 million a month." 
  [Zubko] What currency was in circulation at the mines 
before? 
  [Sokolov] We had tokens in denominations from R1 to R25 and 
our own coins minted in the fifties. Incidentally, this is a 
real find for numismatists. 
  [Zubko] How are you getting by now, bearing in mind that the 
old money supply is inadequate and you are withdrawing the new 
one? 
  [Sokolov] We were in a difficult position. Commodity 
exchange and all workers' and employees' purchases have to be 
made on order forms to the official departments, which tripled 
the chore! But we are collecting up the coins and will send 
them to Moscow, where they will decide what to do with them....

Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others] 
  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry does not rule out that the 
date for a second ministerial meeting on a settlement in Bosnia 
can be agreed at a Contact Group's session in Paris on Tuesday 
[28 June]. As a senior Russian diplomat reported to Interfax on 
Monday, Russia will be represented at the gathering by the 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin. 
  He confirmed that the second ministerial conference would 
most likely take place in Geneva, where the first gathering had 
been held. "It is to put an end to three years of drama in 
former Yugoslavia, a drama that has exasperated everyone in the 
world community", Churkin remarked. 
  In his words, the Contact Group will look at alternative 
world community responses to refusal by one or both belligerents 
to a plan for territorial division in Bosnia, endorsed at the 
previous Geneva meeting, and it is not ruled out that UN may 
leave former Yugoslavia," Churkin said. 
  In keeping with the plan, the Serbs who now control 70 
percent of Bosnia, are to get 49, and the Moslems and Crates [as 
received] - 51 percent of the territory.

  [Text] Athens June 27 -- The Greek Defence Minister 
Yerasimos Arsenis said in an interview carried by the TA NEA 
newspaper on Monday that Russia, taking part in NATO's 
Partnership for Peace programme, might play an important 
stabilising role in the Balkans. He pointed out that 
preparations for signing an agreement on cooperation between 
Greece and Russia in the military sphere are under way. 
  The Greek defence minister said that he was given an 
opportunity to talk with the Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 
the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev before their 
departure from Athens. During the meeting the sides confirmed 
that the Greek defence minister would visit Moscow next month. 
Aresnis said that during the visit, like during his recent trip 
to the United States, the sides will discuss problems of 
security in the Balkan region and the eastern part of the 
Mediterranean region. 
  Speaking about the system of collective security in the 
region, the Greek defence minister said that the Partnership for 
Peace programme envisages interaction between NATO and former 
Comicon countries. In this framework, Greece might put forward 
initiatives, urging for certain kinds of cooperation with other 
neighbouring countries at a political and military level, and 
possibly, with such nato countries as the United States. 
  The U.S. Defence Minister William Perry is arriving in 
Greece 
on an official visit on July 19. The sides will discuss 
problems of cooperation between the two countries with the aim 
of creating a system of security in the region, the Greek 
defence minister said. According to Arsenis, Greece, as a member 
of the European Union and NATO, might assume a certain decisive 
role in the Balkans on behalf of these organsations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F>
Andrey Shitov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- "Russia should carry on arms trade 
on the same principles on which states in the West engage in 
this trade," ITAR-TASS reported today, quoting Sergey Yushenkov, 
chairman of the State Duma's defense committee. 
  Yushenkov described various laws currently in the pipeline 
and said that as a result of Western competition, the United 
States' share of some 30 percent of world arms trade market in 
1987 had now climbed up to almost 60 percent in 1993, as against 
Russia's five percent. 
  Yushenkov also said that Russia had already concluded 
contracts to deliver planes to Malaysia worth approximately 600 
million dollars this year and that Thailand was interested in 
Russian arms and the Russia's Scud system in particular, said to 
be much more effective that the Patriot system. Russia was also 
trying to enter the Latin American markets, ITAR-TASS said. 
  Yushenkov praised the Partnership for Peace deal signed by 
Russia recently and recalled that "Western Europe has still not 
extended the most favored nation status to Russia in full. The 
bans, especially those affecting quantity, affected the output 
of military industrial enterprises." 
  Sergey Yushenkov hoped that having now joined the 
Partnership 
for Peace program Russia would now regain, if only partially, 
its previous stature on its traditional Polish, Czech, and 
Slovak markets, where there was a need for spare parts for 
Russian arms purchased at an earlier stage, ITAR-TASS concluded.

leader of the Government Apparatus, dated 20 June 1994, followed 
by reply from NYG Managing Editor Dmitriy Muratov under the 
"State Secrets" rubric: "We Report, Mr. Kvasov: This Is 1994!"] 
  [Text] For official use 
  To S.N. Kozheurov, chief [glavnyy] editor of NOVAYA 
YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA 
  Dear Sergey Nikolayevich! 
  On 16 June this year your newspaper carried a report 
divulging the contents of Russian Federation Government 
directives stamped "Not for the Press" on the purchase from the 
FRG and Austria of special property for the needs of the Russian 
MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and FCS [Federal 
Counterintelligence Service]. 
  I ask you to conduct an investigation and to report to the 
Russian Federation Government Apparatus on the source of the 
aforesaid information and the grounds on which it was printed. 
  [Signed] V. Kvasov, minister of the Russian Federation and 
leader of the Russian Federation Government Apparatus. 
  Dear Mr. Minister! 
  In a letter sent by courier you demand an indication of the 
grounds on which the information about the government's purchase 
of a large quantity of foreign weapons (Walthers, Colts, 
Winchesters, Parabellums, etc.) and ammunition for them was 
published. 
  I report: The grounds are that this is interesting 
information. 
  You ask for its source to be reported. 
  I reply: in accordance with the Law on the Press... only in 
court. 
  If you deem it possible to shift onto us the responsibility 
for the regime of secrecy in the Government Apparatus, I will 
point out that it is not journalists who must keep your terrible 
secrets but you yourselves. 
  We really do not understand very well why Tula or Vladimir 
"products" are not purchased for the FCS and the MVD and the 
government is evidently more attracted to deals outside Russia's 
"Golden Ring." Incidentally, as our newspaper reported 21 June, 
Boris Nikolayevich personally bought himself a rifle in Tula for 
14 million rubles. 
  A final point. The Government Apparatus has not reacted so 
harshly to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA's articles about lobbyist 
edicts on the part of Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin in respect of a 
number of firms. But in general this makes me feel better: If 
there are state secrets, could this mean that the state exists? 
  [Signed] [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA Managing (vedushchiy) 
Editor] Dmitriy Muratov.

  [Text] Russia and the CSCE are applying similar efforts to 
settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russian presidential 
representative Vladimir Kazimirov stated at a news conference in 
Yerevan Monday. At the same time, the Russian peace settlement 
plan envisioned more guarantees ensuring the mechanism for 
cease-fire than the one proposed by the CSCE, he said. 
  Kazimiriov dismissed speculation that the CSCE and Russia 
had 
differences over the settlement issue. Russia should coordinate 
its efforts with the CSCE, he said. Work is going on to convert 
the Russian plan into a true agreement, a legal document which 
could be signed at a top level, rather than a schedule of 
immediate measures, he said. 
  Kazimirov said the main priority of the Russian plan was to 
develop a mechanism to establish a cease-fire, which is 
essential for moving towards a Nagorno-Karabakh peace settlement. 
  Kazimirov also met Armenian President Levon Ter- Petrosian. 
He told Interfax after the meeting that he was satisfied with 
its results. "Much has been clarified," he said.

  [Text] Turkey is going to introduce a new procedure 
regulating seafaring in the Black Sea straits as of 1 July. 
Authoritative international expert sources say these 
regulations run counter to the principle of seafaring. They are 
also reported to contradict the stipulations of the Convention 
on Straits adopted in the Swiss town of Montreux in 1936. 
Turkey's decision aroused concern among the parties to the 
convention and particularly in the Black Sea countries, for 
which the straits are the only water connection with the 
Mediterranean Sea. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert 
Chernyshev explains Russia's stand on the issue of the Black Sea 
straits in an interview given to the Radio Moscow correspondent 
Mikhail Barushev. 
  Turkey on more than one occasion has declared the 
regulations 
it is introducing do not run counter to the Montreux Convention, 
but rather are aimed at increasing security of the seafaring in 
the straits. We can hardly accept this point of view, says 
Albert Chernyshev. It goes without saying that security of the 
seafaring in this area is extremely important. We are also 
aware of the necessity to upgrade the seafaring regulations in 
the straits. And still we are harboring serious objections and 
firstly because the decision to introduce new seafaring 
regulations in the Black Sea straits has been taken by Turkey 
unilaterally. 
  At the same time, stresses the high-ranking Russian 
diplomat, 
these straits dispose of an international status based on the 
principles of free seafaring. Rules should be improved, but not 
unilaterally. The interests of all parties concerned and 
particularly those of the Black Sea region should also be taken 
into account. 
  We have consulted all the parties to the Montreux 
Convention, 
and we have learned that all of them are generally sharing the 
Russian stand, went on to say Albert Chernyshev. More, we have 
expounded our viewpoint at the recent session of the committee 
for a secure international navigation, that was held in London. 
The participants at the session claimed the new Turkish 
regulations ran counter to the principle of free seafaring. 
They also adopted recommendations for Turkey to be accepted [as 
heard] in order to comply with a regime appropriate to 
international laws. We are going to raise the issue of 
regulations in the Black Sea straits when foreign ministers of 
the Black Sea countries forming an economic zone meet in Tbilisi 
late this week. We shall consistently uphold the principle of 
free seafaring in the Black Sea straits, concluded the Russian 
deputy foreign minister, Albert Chernyshev.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Spitsin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- The forthcoming visit to 
Russia by the Indian Prime Minister R.V. Narasimha Rao, 
scheduled on June 29-July 2, will be an important landmark in 
the development of traditionally friendly relations between the 
people of the two great states, said the Indian ambassador to 
Russia, Ronendra Sen, in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday. 
The ambassador noted that the importance of the visit is 
manifested by the fact that during the Indian prime minister's 
visit two political documents will be signed devoted to a broad 
range of problems of cooperation between Russia and India in the 
international arena and reflecting mutual interests of the two 
countries. 
  The ambassador pointed out that favourable prospects for 
mutually advantageous bilateral cooperation will be outlined in 
a package of agreements pertaining to such important spheres as 
economy and defence, science and engineering, exploration of 
space and environmental protection. The ambassador said that at 
present, Russia and India are witnessing the process of 
successful restructuring of their relations, which began as a 
result of the visit to India by the Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin in January, 1993. The ambassador pointed out that he 
was convinced that Narasimha Rao's visit to Russia would render 
a new meaning to this process. 
  As for bilateral cooperation in the military sphere, it 
develops in the framework of an agreement signed by the Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev during the Russian president's 
visit to Delhi at the beginning of last year. The total sum of 
contracts signed in this field exceeds 500 million dollars, the 
Indian ambassador said.

  [Text] Mexico City June 28 TASS -- The National Bank for 
Foreign Trade of Mexico and the Russian foreign trade 
amalgamation "Energomasheksport" here on Monday signed an 
agreement on opening a credit line for Russian enterprises and 
companies for acquiring goods in this Latin American country. 
  The document envisages the possibility of receiving credits 
for exports to Russia goods worth 2 million U.S. dollars. The 
sides can increase the financial support up to 10 million 
dollars, according to their mutual understanding. Now Russian 
firms, which wish to make use of credit lines for imports of 
Mexican agricultural, consumer and industrial goods, will have 
to approach the "Energomasheksport". 
  This agreement creates an important precedent in bilateral 
ties, Anatoliy Yevdakomov, adviser to the Russian trade 
representation, told ITAR-TASS. Earlier this practice was used 
exclusively by state establishments of the former Soviet Union. 
Now the Mexican side is for the first time using this mutually 
beneficial financial mechanism for the development of economic 
exchange with Russia, he said.

  [Text] The unfinished aircraft carrier Varyag, moored in 
the Nikolayev harbor in the Black Sea, will in all probability 
have to be scrapped. The scrapping will cost $174.6 million and 
take 4.5 years to complete. Even though some quarters have 
expressed interest in buying the vessel, any plans to sell it 
are hampered by the existing agreement between Russia and 
Ukraine, under which vessels of this type cannot be sold to a 
third country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Captain 1st Class Olle Jonsson by Valeriy </F>
Gromak; place and date not given: "High-Ranking Member of the 
Swedish Military Considers that It Is Essential for Russia To 
Have a Military Base in Kaliningrad Oblast"] 
  [Text] Captain 1st Class Olle Jonsson was appointed flag 
captain of the Swedish Navy two weeks ago. He is 54 years old 
and has spent 34 years in the Navy. He has served in various 
posts on all types of ship apart from submarines. His last post 
was head of a training center in Karlskrona. 
  Olle Jonsson gave an interview to our correspondent. 
  [Gromak] Mr. Jonsson, we are living at a time when new 
relationships are being established between states. This leaves 
its mark on the reform of the armed forces, including the navy. 
Changes are likewise taking place in the Russian Navy. In 
particular the fleet forces are being significantly reduced 
today. I am interested in whether the Swedish Navy will suffer 
cuts? 
  [Jonsson] The arms reduction process has also affected the 
Swedish Navy with all its force. We have already been forced to 
cut a proportion of officers this year. A series of small naval 
warships which, given their length of service, could go on 
serving for another 10 years, is being withdrawn from the combat 
strength. Minelayers are also being withdrawn from the combat 
strength due to the expense of servicing them. 
  [Gromak] What prospects do you see for further cooperation 
between Russian and Swedish seamen? 
  [Jonsson] It is a very good thing that Russian and Swedish 
ships are taking part in joint exercises for the second year 
running. This allows us to get to know each other better. For 
example, Russian military medics came on board and visited our 
ship Goteborg when we put in together to the port of Kiel. They 
discussed the generally understood topics of providing emergency 
medical treatment at sea and of dealing with an emergency. 
  [Gromak] The Baltic Fleet is on the whole based in 
Kaliningrad Oblast. During a recent visit to Kaliningrad, 
Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas stated that the 
large concentration of troops in the area seems to be an 
anomaly. I am interested in hearing the opinion of a member of 
the Swedish military on this matter. 
  [Jonsson] First, I have not heard about this statement by 
the prime minister [as published]. Second, I will express my 
personal opinion. I consider that it is essential for Russia to 
have a military base in Kaliningrad Oblast, especially now that 
you have to all intents and purposes left all your bases on the 
Baltic Sea....

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useinov: "The Mirage of Kuwait"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- The Caspian could turn into a settling tank 
if, in the quest for foreign contracts, the champions of 
national interests do not concern themselves with the fate of 
its ecosystem. 
  A meeting of leaders and experts from oil companies in 
Istanbul was devoted to the development of oil and gas deposits 
on the Caspian shelf. Azerbaijan intends to sign it in the next 
few weeks [sentence as published]. However, within the flow of 
news anticipating the upcoming ceremonies, notes of alarm and 
bitterness have appeared in the local press in the past few 
days, going as far as the stunning news that the deal might not 
take place at all. 
  Attention is focused on commentary concerning the Russian 
Federation's official position in respect of the legal base of 
the agreements being concluded with foreign companies in states 
around the Caspian in the absence of a status for the Caspian 
itself. The matter boils down to questions which Russia raised 
both a year ago and two years ago: It is necessary to determine 
the status of the Caspian -- legal, economic, environmental, and 
other norms for the joint use of this unique body of water and 
the rights and responsibility of all the Caspian states and each 
of them individually. The problem is undoubtedly debatable, 
extremely complex, and historically unclear. It appears that 
the most reasonable thing to do is to convene an international 
conference on the Caspian under the aegis of the United Nations, 
which would in fact settle all the controversial questions, 
including the most burning one -- whether to consider the 
Caspian to be a sea or a lake. 
  It is quite lawful that, following the first contract of the 
century -- the "Tengiz" deal -- Russia deemed it necessary to 
express its stance on the second one, work on which is now being 
conducted in Istanbul. In principle, this concerns all 
agreements on the Caspian which have been concluded or are in 
the preparation stage, because the worsening environmental 
crisis, the high concentration of harmful substances, and 
likewise the uncontrolled fishing, equally concern Turkmenistan, 
Kazakhstan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. Russia is not making an 
exception for itself: It has temporarily closed down the 
already developed oil deposits in the waters of Dagestan until 
the status of the Caspian is determined and a principle for 
dividing its wealth is elaborated. 
  That is roughly how the Russian Federation embassy in Baku 
explained the situation, expressing regret that the normal 
notification through diplomatic channels of one state's stance 
to another -- a major company of which, British Petroleum, will 
conduct the development of deposits on the Azerbaijani section 
of the Caspian shelf -- was greeted with excessive suspicion. 
Furthermore, the opposition press was bursting with indignation, 
trying to accuse Russia of putting pressure on Azerbaijan and 
wanting to confirm its diktat over the Caspian. And, as usual, 
this question is being seen in the context of a Russian plan to 
settle the Karabakh conflict. The point of the reaction is 
clear: Pressure is being applied from the left and from the 
right. The official point of view, which leaves no room for 
doubt, is: It is more obvious to us with whom we should conduct 
talks, and what contracts should be concluded and on what terms. 
  The British Petroleum office in Baku also did its bit, 
explaining that before the talks began the company studied all 
the visible and invisible legal aspects connected with the 
preparation of the contract. 
  Observers, however, are unanimous in their opinion: Russia's 
position should not be ignored -- it concerns the fate of the 
Caspian as a whole, which is incomparable with the advantage of 
any one of the contracts. It is no secret that the closed 
ecosystem is gradually turning into a scrap heap and settling 
tank. During the latest storm everything is getting muddled up. 
Just try to distinguish where the most dangerous substances 
have been discharged -- in Sumgait or on the Turkmen coast. Not 
one Caspian state wants to bear the responsibility for the 
damage done. That is precisely what has dictated Russia's 
entirely reasonable concern about how the new developments, 
which notably rule out environmental control, will affect the 
state of the Caspian. Iran and Turkmenistan, remember, are also 
conducting work to develop the oil deposits on its parts of the 
Caspian shelf. 
  Yes, the temptation of competing with Kuwait in terms of 
wealth, obtaining fantastic profits, and reviving the national 
economy is great. All this, however, should not rule out 
responsibility for the fate of the Caspian. Russia, as one of 
the Caspian states, (for the sake of the common good) does not 
want the sea shores to turn into a settling tank. However, the 
champions of national interests, who have been carried away by 
discussions on geopolitical themes, have not paid due attention 
to this. What are the interests of future generations to them: 
After all, all their time, it appears, is being spent in 
conjecture about renewed Russian expansion. Obviously, this is 
a shame.

<F P=106> [Natalya Pachegina report in the "Northern Caucasus" column: </F>
"Galazov and Aushev Have Signed an Accord. Today 12,000 Ingushi 
Live in North Ossetia"] 
  [Excerpt] Although, contrary to Ruslan Aushev's wishes, 
the document signed the evening of 26 June in Beslan, 
(Vladikavkaz Airport) "On Procedures for the Return of Refugees 
and Forced Resettlers to Places of their Former Residence," did 
not become a full-scale treaty "resolving all the urgent 
problems between North Ossetia and Ingushetia," it definitely 
not only filled a temporary pause in the Vladikavkaz-Nazran 
dialogue but, with both sides willing, can be accepted as 
guidance for action. 
  Coordinated in detail at the level of conciliation 
commissions from both republics and with the participation of 
officials from the Provisional Administration, the document 
envisions an extended preparatory stage, part of which, it needs 
to be recognized, has already been completed: Lists have been 
made up of Ingushi citizens who earlier lived in North Ossetia 
(the starting point is 31 October 1992 or -- here Vladikavkaz 
showed flexibility -- on the basis of any other documents 
confirming residence registration in the republic). Public 
security on resettlement territories is entrusted to the forces 
attached to the Provisional Administration and the Internal 
Affairs Ministry of North Ossetia. As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's 
correspondent was told, if any of the newly arriving Ingushi 
citizens express the wish to join North Ossetian law enforcement 
bodies, this wish will be granted immediately. The problem of 
"screening" -- so painful in the previous talks -- has been 
resolved quite happily in the document: The sides agreed that 
the return of the refugees must not depend on the presence of 
criminal elements among them, while the extent of their guilt 
will be established by the relevant bodies. 
  Under the document signed, development of the social 
infrastructure in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages is to begin on 1 
July. The first to return to their homes will be the owners of 
houses that are still intact. The "prime contractor" will be 
the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations; its 
representatives will ensure the building of temporary structures 
for people who lost their homes and property to fire. In 
accordance with the agreement, work related to the return of 
Ingushi citizens will be financed by federal power bodies which, 
as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent understands, have not up 
to now unduly forced their attention on either side. 
Coordination (transportation, communication, and escorting) has 
been assigned to a special department formed in the Provisional 
Administration, which is to draw up a schedule for the 
transportation of citizens by 5 July. 
  Vladikavkaz hopes that the newly arriving Ingushi citizens 
will not only recognize the republic's territorial integrity and 
its laws and renounce any attempts to propagate interethnic 
strife, but will also show an example of obeying the law to all 
other citizens of North Ossetia. According to statistical 
reports by the Republic of North Ossetia, since November 1992, 
12,000 Ingushi have retuned to the republic for permanent 
residence. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald Kessariyskiy] </F>
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod, 27 Jun -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDRP] faction 
in the State Duma, who is visiting here, is today at the center 
of another political scandal. He sat himself in the chair of 
the governor of Nizhniy Novgorod oblast to use the government 
communications telephone to notify the president's secretariat, 
the government, and the Russian Federal Counterintelligence 
Service of the obstruction he and 11 other members of an LDPR 
parliamentary delegation encountered during their visit to the 
town. 
  In a statement for the press, the visitor from Moscow 
accused 
the local authorities of nothing less than "gross violations of 
the law on the status of deputies and of the Russian 
Constitution." "Yesterday, at the airport," the LDPR leader 
said, "we were met by pickets, bussed in just for the plane's 
arrival. There was heckling from the crowd, not only directed 
at us, but also at the president. It transpired that the 
demonstrators did not have permission to stage a picket, yet the 
hecklers were led by an assistant of the Nizhniy Novgorod 
governor." 
  Zhirinovskiy expressed dissatisfaction that his delegation 
"was not given an escort group," as a result of which it was 
forced "to travel in the town at its own risk." He said that 
planned meetings with workers at the "GAZ" joint-stock company 
and the machine-building works, and also in the town of 
Dzerzhinsk, had been cancelled. An air balloon bearing the 
words "Zhirinovskiy -- No Way!" floated in the sky above the 
Volga. 
  The LDPR leader alleged that he tried to meet the governor, 
[Boris] Nemtsov, but without success. Other leaders of the 
administration also were unwilling to meet the visitor from 
Moscow. When he did eventually decide "to inform Sergey Filatov, 
Yuriy Yarov and Sergey Stepashin about these events," people 
"threw a monkey wrench -- they switched off the government 
communications line." Zhirinovskiy called this antistate 
activity, which is taking place "at a point when political 
parties and movements have actually achieved a fragile accord, 
by signing that document [as received]." 
  He said he intends very soon to raise the issue of the 
immediate dismissal of governor Nemtsov from his post at the 
State Duma.

  [Text] The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR), Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, has left the office of Nizhniy 
Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov that he had seized for two hours 
supported by other deputies of the State Duma and local party 
activists. Zhirinovskiy was not satisfied with the reception he 
had been given and in protest seized the office of the governor, 
currently on a visit abroad. 
  The LDPR leader left the administration building promising 
to 
"kick out" the governor's female secretary and execute his 
assistant by firing squad. 
  At a meeting with the public in the House of Architects, 
Zhirinovskiy spoke against the restoration of the former Soviet 
Union, because in then [as reveived] "the republics would have 
to be fed." Instead, he supported "a Russian state within the 
borders of the former Soviet Union." Zhirinovskiy promised to 
accomplish the task and abolish ethnic formations within Russia 
in five years, if he came in power. 
  At the same meeting, State Duma LDPR Deputy Yuriy Kuznetsov 
said that "only Russians must rule Russia, as Chechens in power 
may squander Russia's assets to their villages, while Jews could 
smuggle them all abroad." 
  On June 28, Zhirinovskiy is scheduled to visit Arzamas-16, a 
center of the nuclear industry.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald Kessarijskiy] </F>
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod June 28 TASS -- Reformist Governor 
of Nizhniy Novgorod Boris Nemtsov filed a lawsuit against 
Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who he accused 
of breaking into his office in his absence after which several 
documents and souvenirs disappeared. 
  TASS learned from the prosecutor of the region Aleksandr 
Fedotov on Tuesday that Zhirinovskiy is accused of violating the 
law on the status of lawmakers which fixes inviolability of 
their offices. Nemtsov is a member of the Federation Council, 
the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. 
  The incident occurred during a recent visit of Zhirinovskiy 
to the city on the Volga where the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party was met by angry residents shouting "go home" 
to him. 
  Zhirinovskiy qualified the "welcome" as "infringement on 
personal prestige" and wanted to clear up the issue with the 
local governor. 
  Nemtsov was out of his office at the moment. However, 
Zhirinovskiy used his government telephone to report his 
complaints to the presidential administration, the government 
and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. According to the 
staff of the governor, Zhirinovskiy resorted to numerous threats 
against them.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray told 
Interfax that the country's regions and territories would 
inevitably acquire the economic and legal rights now enjoyed by 
its republics. 
  He said that 18 out of 21 republics incorporated in Russia 
were much weaker economically than nearly every region. 
Shakhray thought that inter-regional association such as the 
Siberian Accord had become a way to achieve horizontal 
integration of territories and regions and a new Russian 
regional policy. 
  Shakhray said that an agreement between the central 
government and eight inter-regional associations that had been 
drafted more than six weeks ago could be signed very shortly.

<F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] The government adopted a decision in April to create 
a federal fund to finance the early shipment of cargoes to the 
North. A government commission headed by Deputy Prime Minister 
Sergey Mikhaylovich Shakhray is responsible for the distribution 
of the funds and the supervision of their use. During a news 
conference held as a part of his working visit to Magadan, he 
told of how this commission works: 
  [Begin Shakhray recording] This is not a tourist trip -- 
this 
is the work of a government commission which has the powers to 
solve some of the problems on site. This is how the commission 
works: First, ministries represented by people empowered to 
make decisions -- usually by a deputy minister -- work here with 
the appropriate department of the administration. There are a 
lot of examples: For example, the MPS [Ministry of Railroads] in 
Krasnoyarsk Kray port solved several questions on the spot; 
several problems were directly solved in Surgut. This same 
applies to Magadan Oblast. 
  This is not just an exchange of opinions and information; 
having discussed the volume of supply and financing, we are 
actually preparing a government document containing instructions 
on volumes, on what should shipped where, and how it should be 
done and implemented. In other words, this is not a 
familiarization tour and not a scientific and practical 
conference. 
  Therefore, I hope -- no, I am certain -- that the situation 
will change after this visit, not in the least because we have 
squeezed out the first part of the financial aid of 55 billion 
rubles as part of the preparations for this visit. The head of 
the administration is now able to maneuver and make decisions 
which we are also discussing here. Therefore, this is practical 
work, and we will do everything to guarantee the minimum of 
functions necessary for the North to survive. This means 
Russia's wealth, and of course, people, specialists, and 
resources. 
  But one should be honest and candid -- it has been mentioned 
that under the conditions of the budget financing for 1994, we 
will be forced to work under stressful conditions and will be 
able to provide only a minimum, or maybe even bordering on the 
minimum of what the North, in this case, Magadan Oblast, needs. 
I am referring to petroleum products, coal, and a supply of 
food reduced for the federal budget. [sentence as heard] 
  Moreover, there are issues critical to the oblast which have 
to do with other kinds [of products]. We explored various ways 
of applying efforts. A new system of financing was employed 
this year -- instead of financial resources being scattered 
across many organizations, in the case of Magadan Oblast, 
practically all of it is deposited as a part of the budget in a 
special account available to the head of Magadan Oblast. His 
task is organizing the preagreement work, to check on suppliers 
and consumers and their transportation systems -- the selection 
is not very varied here -- so as to organize this work and to 
prevent the scattering of funds. 
  We have allocated Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this 
fund from the federal fund. It is a budget subsidy with an 
interest rate which is a little less than 70 percent of the 
interest rate charged by the central bank. So, in effect, these 
are preferential conditions for financing. We have allocated 
Magadan Oblast 50 billion rubles for this fund, and you can 
judge the demands for yourselves because according to the 
limited calculations of the oblast itself, it needs more than 
300 billion rubles. This is the sum which, together with 
centralized credits amounting to about 35 billion rubles, would 
allow us to start work, and to start it by bringing cargoes in. 
  We have decided on a protocol which would allow us to 
finance 
at least 70 percent of all the demand for cargoes brought in. 
When the icebreaker fleet starts working, or when 
Severo-Evenskiy Rayon, as a rayon of Magadan Oblast, closes 
completely during a time of limited incoming shipments, it will 
already be too late. Therefore, July is a key month, and in 
organizing the work itself, the Magadan Oblast Administration 
gives me hope that we will overcome this task through joint 
efforts. We must not turn the North into yet another source of 
Russian refugees -- not only from the South, as has been the 
case up until now, but from the North as well. However, you 
must understand that the people who remain in the North must be 
those who would be guaranteed work, and who would be able to 
live under conditions in which their children, family, and 
environment would be protected. 
  Therefore, gold mining and other areas of development of 
Magadan Oblast... [pauses] we have examined the issue of the two 
hydroelectric power stations, and it is clear that there will be 
a redistribution of resources, that new work places will have 
to be looked for, and that there will be an exodus from Magadan 
Oblast. However, this exodus must be an organized and a planned 
one, and we have inspected the issue of the supply of 
containers, of compensation, and of the fulfillment of 
government edict No. 11-41 of last year on the payment of this 
compensation. I do not want these processes to become 
uncontrolled or unplanned, and it is desirable that even people 
leaving Magadan Oblast or moving from the northern part of the 
oblast to its south survive as the potential of the Far East and 
the Russian North. [end recording]

  [Text] Ivan Rybkin, State Duma chairman, told journalists 
in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky that the country's regions had to be 
given more leeway and that the Duma would do just that in 
discussing the 1995 budget. He thought that the Russian Far 
East could solve its problems without federal subsidies. 
  Rybkin currently heads a group of parliamentarians touring 
Siberia and the Far East. 
  Asked about the proposal, made by Vladimir Shumeyko, 
chairman 
of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian 
parliament, that elections to the the Federal Assembly be put 
off, Rybkin emphasized that parliament had to earn this honor 
and that two-thirds of the country's regions and republics had 
to endorse this step. 
  He admitted that people were obviously tired of elections 
but 
said that the logic of life as well as the Constitution were 
against this step.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsov] </F>
  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk June 28 TASS -- Russian State Duma 
speaker Ivan Rybkin said the disputed Kuril Islands claimed by 
Japan should remain Russia and be granted special rights in 
economic development. 
  "The Kurils are our Russian islands", Rybkin said on Tuesday 
after visiting the picturesque Iturup Island. He quoted local 
residents as telling him that "such beauty should not be lost". 
  Rybkin stressed that it is necessary to pay more attention 
to 
the development of the islands "especially in the current crisis 
conditions in economy". He proposed to adopt a law on the 
Kurils and Sakhalin which will "grant special rights to the 
region mostly in economic issues". This would be for the 
benefit of Russia in general, according to him. 
  The speaker also urged to pay more attention to the military 
serving on the islands. He said the unit which he visited on 
Iturup has only 21 per cent of the necessary personnel and faces 
constant financial problems. "It is necessary to decide once and 
for all that the units deployed on the islands should be manned 
first and have priority in getting all the necessary supplies", 
Rybkin said. 
  He welcomed the recent anti-poaching operation held near the 
Kuril Islands as it ended the ambiguity to who the islands 
belong. "This was not just a training for coast guards, but 
protection of our economic interests", he said and added that "a 
certain ambiguity regarding the Kuril Islands gives rise to a 
desire of some countries to go and make a profit at the expense 
of others (by fishing) actually in our internal waters". 
  Rybkin stressed that such actions are completely 
inadmissible 
in other countries.

Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, who is leading a parliamentary 
delegation on a tour of Siberia and the Far East, and the 
Command of the Fleet in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. Apart from 
financial problems, the meeting also focused on the problems of 
manning the armed forces and scrapping stocks of ammunition.

  [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, 28 Jun (TASS) -- An 
accident has occurred at the radioactive wastes depository 
situated on the shore of Seldevaya bay not far from 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. Two slabs from the covering were 
damaged from being washed with water from melted snow and have 
caved in. This has been reported in today's issue of IZVESTIYA, 
quoting the heads of the oblast headquarters of the civil 
defense. According to these data, the radiation directly above 
the crack that has formed is eight milliroentgens, that is 1,000 
times higher than the natural background for Kamchatka. 
  However, the heads of the civil defense headquarters think 
that this radiation does not present a danger to the residents 
of the oblast centre and the neighboring settlements: it is 
local and "fades away" at a distance of a few meters. At the 
present time repair work is being carried out at the burial 
ground. 
  What is more, no one has managed to get complete and 
objective information about the the situation at the storage 
yet: admission to this secret facility which belongs to the 
nuclear submarine flotilla, is closed to all civil inspectors. 
Even the information that the civil defense headquarters has at 
its disposal has been obtained from navy sailors.

  [Text] Vladivostok -- The two and a half years of life 
under a so-called market economy have been sheer torment and 
torture for our ship repair plant. In the first five months of 
this year alone, the Pacific Fleet has run up debts to the plant 
in the order of 13 billion rubles [R]. This, in turn, includes 
R525 million in administrative fines and penalties which the 
plant owes to the state budget, the pension fund, and 
enterprises keeping us going on a day-to-day basis. Workers 
have not received their pay for three months running, and any 
attempt to explain to people why this is happening immediately 
turns into a spontaneous rally. Today, the plant's debts come 
to R2.5 billion. 
  Another few days of operation, and then we will grind to a 
halt. We have run aground. The main directorate is asking that 
production continue even at the cost of halting military ship 
repairs altogether and occupying production capacities with any 
output. But how long will these measures last?

  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- On the government's 
moves to accelerate the reform and lift the country out of the 
economic crisis -- Report of the Council of Ministers at the 
Supreme Kenges session on 23 July 1994 (presenter Prime Minister 
S.A. Tereshchenko): 
  Esteemed Chairman, esteemed deputies of the Supreme Kenges 
of 
Kazakhstan: 
  The Council of Ministers has submitted a new document for 
consideration by the parliament, a memorandum which includes 
information on the government's moves to implement the program 
of urgent anticrisis measures and broaden the reform, as well as 
the main program objectives of the government's economic midterm 
policy resulting from the president's address to the Supreme 
Kenges. 
Besides, the government has completed its elaboration of the 
program of actions aimed at accelerating the reform and 
stabilizing the economy, making specific the main provisions of 
the president's address to parliament and the memorandum you 
received earlier. 
  This program is based on the proposals selected by the 
commission set up by the president in January this year. The 
program takes into account the opinions of entrepreneurs, 
industrialists, researchers, ministries, and departments. It 
was discussed at the congress of industrialists and 
entrepreneurs and at yesterday's session of the Council of 
Ministers. President Nazarbayev made some comments on it. The 
program will be further elaborated and submitted for your 
discussion. Its main guidelines are depicted in the memorandum 
and in the illustrative materials. 
  To avoid repeating the aforementioned documents, I believe 
it 
appropriate to dwell in my speech on an analysis of the reform's 
progress and on the main problems, and also to highlight the key 
directions of our work, the essence and substance of the 
government's measures to be taken in the coming period. 
  The toughness and duration of the process of radically 
transforming a planned economy into a market one depend mainly 
on which approaches are used. 
  In our republic, the government's course comprises three 
basic measures: 
  1. Economic liberalization through removal of controls over 
prices and manufacturers; 
  2. Macroeconomic stabilization through regulation of the 
money in circulation and achievement of a balanced budget; 
  3. The sale of state property to individuals and/or 
organizations. 
  The course of reforms carried out by the government in 
previous years was objectively predestined and unavoidable. One 
can say that it was mistaken; one can object to it; one can, so 
to say, "forcefully" express lack of confidence in it. However, 
nothing can change the realistic assessment of that course. No 
matter who headed the government or who the members of the 
government were, the government would have pushed the reform in 
the same direction. To say that some things might have been 
done better is quite another matter, but that would be to speak 
only of some quantitative changes, not qualitative ones. The 
results would have been exactly the same -- deterioration, 
inflation, a decline of living standards. 
  Can one seriously speak about implementing any other 
measures 
given that the USSR and the common economic area have 
disintegrated but the common ruble is still there, and that we 
lost big financial sources and inherited an exceptionally 
unbalanced economy at the start of the reform after Russia began 
its reforms? Certainly not! 
  Anything the government says or does is now criticized. I am 
quite sure that somebody will again ask: "How long are you 
going to keep referring to the former USSR to 1992?" 
  Nevertheless, unless we look back to the starting point, one 
cannot digest the logic and dynamics of changes, one cannot 
understand what we have already achieved or the position in 
which we find ourselves, the point we have reached in the course 
of transition and what our next steps will be. 
  In this respect, the further away we are from 1992, the 
better and deeper we see the underwater part of the whole 
iceberg of the problems we have had to tackle. 
  It is absolutely clear today that to transfer the economy 
from one state into a qualitatively new one which is on a much 
higher level demands money, and a lot of money. 
  We began our reform under ultimately unfavorable conditions 
when, after the collapse of the USSR, we lost large subsidies 
and subventions from the center, when the source supplying us 
with cheap petrodollars was depleted, and when "Gorbachev's" 
foreign loans were coming to their end. 
  All this meant knowing full well first, that the budget 
demanded significant cuts even without reforms, second, that we 
would have to implement the reforms at our own expense. The 
latter meant in fact that we would have to be very tough toward 
the production and social sphere. In fact, we have done that. 
  The burden of taxes was constantly increasing. The debit 
side of the budget was kept within the necessary limits at the 
expense of continuing cuts in the social sphere. 
  When we were in the ruble zone, we could for a certain time 
compensate for all our production budget cuts with the help of a 
softer crediting policy. But after Russia had introduced 
corresponding accounts, and later when the ruble zone collapsed, 
we had to be much tougher in our crediting policy. 
  Any softening of loans or budget after the introduction of 
our own national currency would have meant inflation and a fall 
in the tenge exchange rate, and further blows for the production 
and social sphere. 
  If you like, this is all there is to know about the ins and 
outs of the ongoing processes, and this is the state of finance 
in the period of reforms. 
  Of late, we have got so used psychologically to negative 
processes in our society and economy that we do not pay 
sufficient attention to positive phenomena. Without timely 
evaluation and support for the latter, we cannot view the long 
term prospects or correctly grasp our strategic development. 
Since the beginning of the reform and Kazakhstan's acquisition 
of state independence two and a half years ago, we have done 
quite a lot. This enabled us to achieve noticeable positive 
changes which ensure the irreversibility of our society on its 
way from the command-distribution system to a market economy. 
  1. First of all, cardinal changes are occurring in the 
ownership relations which are the basis for all structural and 
economic reforms. 
  The ratio between the state and private sectors of the 
economy are changing significantly. The private sector's share 
in the overall gross domestic product in the previous five years 
has almost trebled -- from 9 percent in 1988 to 26 perceent in 
1993. 
  The ongoing process of privatization, which is strictly 
channeled along all three directions, enhances the growth of the 
private sector. 
  2. A complete replacement of the centralized state pricing 
system by a free market pricing system is a positive step. 
  The previous state pricing system disguised deep structural 
biases and disproportions which had emerged in the republic's 
economy. Very often the system did not react to the dynamically 
changing demands and requirements of specific consumers, and 
systematically generated a devastating shortage of various goods 
and services. 
  Today most of the prices are set by manufacturers 
themselves, 
by distributors and sellers who take into account the ratio 
between supply and demand on the commodity markets. Currently, 
free market prices, which very quickly react to any changes in 
consumers' demands and even to decisions made by the government, 
very often force enterprises and individual entrepreneurs to 
radically restructure their work. 
  3. The government has achieved positive changes in 
liberalizing domestic and foreign trade. The discredited system 
of centralized distribution of material and technical resources 
has been practically fully dismantled. It did not allow state 
enterprises to independently sell their products directly to 
buyers. Because of this, useless stockpiles of unwanted 
products built up in warehouses and resources were in short 
supply. 
  Today enterprises are absolutely free to choose their trade 
partners and they can freely determine with them all contractual 
provisions and all agreements on production and delivery of 
goods. The government no longer interferes in the establishment 
of economic links; on the contrary, it strives to assist 
domestic enterprises, especially when mutual deliveries to 
enterprises in Russia and other CIS member countries are 
concerned. 
  The list of licensed and quoted goods has been significantly 
reduced, both for exports and imports. 
  Restrictions on the export of goods sold for the national 
currency have been lifted. Customs duties and tariffs have been 
seriously re-examined. 
  Social and economic stability, and the government's 
consistency in implementing the reform, have provided firm 
guarantees for foreign investors. During the previous two 
years, the volume of investment has nearly trebled. The 
republic had a positive trade balance in 1993 for the very first 
time. 
  4. As far as the budget reform is concerned, the government 
and the previous Supreme Kenges established a system of taxes 
and tariffs which is an integral whole, though it may be far 
from perfect. Direct budget subsidies for enterprises have been 
eliminated. Subsidies for regulated prices are also being 
eliminated. The government has consistently decreased budget 
expenditures on subsidies for loss-making enterprises and 
compensations for differences in related costs and prices. In 
1992 they equalled 11.6 percent of all expenditures, and in 1993 
they were only 6.2 percent. Import subsidies have also been 
discontinued. 
  Apart from implementing its nationwide objectives, the 
budget 
is becoming more and more socially oriented owing to the 
targeted support for the least protected groups of the 
population. Along with this, the Finance Ministry is gaining 
more control. 
  The government's relations with the national bank are 
becoming more market oriented. The national bank is 
concentrating on monetary circulation matters and on 
strengthening the national currency in the framework of the 
two-tier banking system.

<F P=106> [Article by Kamil Bayalinov under the "Chinese Ceremonies" </F>
rubric: "Chinese People's Nuclear Tests Fall to the Lot of the 
Kyrgyz People"] 
  [Text] The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry has finally responded 
to this Chinese nuclear explosion with a "statement." The mild 
document, retouched by experienced diplomats, says that 
Kyrgyzstan..."welcomes the aspiration expressed by China for the 
complete destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, as well as 
for the achievement of a universal ban on nuclear testing." The 
whole tone of the statement is couched in a spirit as if 
Kyrgyzstan were apologizing for its nuclear tests. However, at 
the end of the "memorandum," the diplomats got down to business: 
"In the space of not quite two years, China has carried out 
three nuclear tests. To us it is obvious that such tests have a 
negative effect on the environmental situation and the health of 
people in the region. Kyrgyzstan, as a state which borders 
directly on China, is experiencing justified and growing concern 
about this matter." 
  Having carefully studied the document, the Chinese Embassy 
in 
Bishkek delivered its answer to Kyrgyz representatives. It 
reports that China unfailingly advocates "the complete 
destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, and, in this context, 
the implementation of a universal ban on nuclear tests." But 
since China understands the concern of its neighbors perfectly 
well, then it is exerting every effort to conclude treaties on a 
universal ban on nuclear explosions.... 
  Following such an answer, it evidently remains for the 
Kyrgyz 
to apologize for the trouble caused to the Chinese. 
  The Chinese nuclear test range at Lop Nor is situated to the 
south of East Turkestan, which is now part of the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region. The first explosion occurred in October 
1964. By the late 1960's there had been a series of tests of 
hydrogen bombs. At first the test range occupied a modest area 
-- 56 km by 36 km -- but then it expanded considerably. The PRC 
nuclear research center is located here. Three operating sites 
for conducting explosions on land, underground, and in the air, 
are located on the territory of the test range. A test range 
for the study of the effect of radiation on animals and plants 
is situated near the city of Hotan. But the zone of the effect 
of radiation on people does not just include the entire Chinese 
autonomous area, but also one-half of Kyrgyzstan and part of 
Kazakhstan. According to figures from the 
"Nevada-Semipalatinsk" international antinuclear movement, after 
every hydrogen bomb test at the Lop Nor test range, the infant 
mortality rate in Alma-Ata [Almaty] and the area has gone up by 
30-60 percent. 
  It is interesting that at the time of the latest test at Lop 
Nor, east winds have been blowing over the test range (this is 
very rare in the area, incidentally), in a direction away from 
Central China and toward Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Following 
the nuclear explosion in May 1992, aerosol tests in Bishkek 
showed an increase in the activity of ruthenium and strontium 
radiation by a factor of 20. And after all, Bishkek is 1,000 km 
away from the test range! 
  However, as far as radiation is concerned, there are no 
borders or distances. The Chernobyl tragedy is an example of 
this. 
  In four months' time, the Lop Nor test range will be 30 
years 
old. During this period, the Chinese military have conducted 22 
surface and 15 underground tests of nuclear and thermonuclear 
weapons. Naturally, without informing either their own citizens 
or the governments of adjacent countries about it. 
  The latest explosion resounded 10 June of this year. A 
powerful cyclone swept over northern Kyrgyzstan within several 
days. Information about an increase in the radiation level has 
not found its way into the press yet. The Kyrgyz leadership is 
adopting all possible measures to reduce anti-Chinese moods 
among the people, which are being intensified from one day to 
the next. And not only because of the nuclear tests being 
carried out by the mighty neighbor.

the sectors of the Moskovskiy border guarding detachments was 
fired upon from automatic weapons from Afghan territory on 
Monday night, sources at the department of Russian border troops 
in Tajikistan told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [28 June]. 
  Fire was intensive enough, but, luckily, none of border 
guards was hurt. The border guards did not return the fire, the 
sources said. 
  The situation in the other sectors of the Tajik-Afghan 
border 
remains rather complex but is controlled by Russian border 
guards.

  [Excerpt] The second round of Tajikistan peace talks, which 
began in Tehran 10 days ago, ended this morning and the two 
sides reached some agreements on ways to implement a cease-fire. 
  During this round of talks, held in our country's Foreign 
Ministry Institute for Political and International Studies since 
last Saturday under the auspices of the UN secretary general's 
envoy, the two sides signed a joint communique today, stressing 
the need to abandon hostility and accept national 
reconciliation. Although the communique has not specified a 
timetable for implementing the agreements reached, the two sides 
have stressed the importance of implementing the cease-fire, 
halting illegal detention, and stopping any offensive operations 
and troop movements in Tajikistan and along its borders. 
  Also in this communique, the representatives of the 
Tajikistan government and the opposition groups have reached 
some agreements on the next round of talks in Islamabad and 
discussion on the issues related to the mechanism of controlling 
the cease-fire. The agenda of the second round of Tajikistan 
peace talks includes four main axes of establishing a 
cease-fire, a general amnesty, return of the refugees, and 
holding elections. The two sides, however, agreed to 
concentrate the main talks on the cease-fire control mechanism.

  [Text] Akbar Turajonzoda, a co-chairman of the Islamic 
Renaissance Movement, said that the talks between the government 
and opposition held in Tehran had failed to produce a single 
joint document thus far. Talks on a cease-fire are still 
underway while the agenda has not been discussed, he said. 
  In an Interfax interview he expressed doubt that a mutually 
acceptable formula could be found before the talks ended. 
Turajonzoda emphasized, however, that if an agreement were 
signed, the opposition would observe a ceasefire inside the 
Republic as well as on the border. He made it clear that the 
official Dushanbe had also to abide by the agreement and 
compliance with it had to be supervised by observers from the UN 
and other international organizations. 
  Turajonzoda denied that the Tajik opposition had a hand in 
terrorist activities against Russian servicemen. He emphasized 
that Russia was the main guarantor of Tajikistan's security and 
the country's ally. 
  He thought that the acts of terror against Russian 
servicemen 
in Tajikistan had been engineered by those who wanted to drag 
Russia into the mire of civil war in Tajikistan and opposed a 
political settlement there. 
  Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy commander of 
Russian border guards, told INTERFAX that the acts of terror 
against his men had been committed on direct orders from the 
Tajik government-in-exile. He believed that the most dangerous 
acts of terror (the latest of them occurred on 24 June when 
unknown gunmen fired at a bus carrying border guards officers in 
Dushanbe) had been perpetrated by the Black Islam group known 
for its fanaticism and callous cruelty. 
  Bespalov said that on the orders from the leaders of the 
Tajik opposition and the commander-in-chief of its militias 
Rezvon units of fighters had been concentrating on the 
Tajik-Afghan border, poised for an attack on Shuroabad, Darvaza 
and Bakhorak. 
  According to intelligence reports, the opposition leaders 
ordered moving Badakhshan front units, in which Iranian, 
Pakistani and Saudi mercenaries serve, from deep in Afghanistan 
to border areas. A field hospital has been deployed in the 
Afghan town of Chah-e Ab for Tajik opposition fighters and 
mercenaries. Its staff was recruited in Islamic states. 
  Bespalov thought that this was evidence of Tajik opposition 
leaders' intention to escalate the fighting. He said that those 
who obstructed the peace process on the border and inside the 
country would bear the responsibility for it.

told INTERFAX recently that he did not rule out complicity of 
the Tajik opposition in terrorist activities against the Russian 
servicemen and ethnic Russians in Tajikistan. 
  He admitted, however, that there was no direct evidence that 
the acts of terror were the work of the opposition. 
  For his part Lieutenant General Aleksandr Bespalov, deputy 
commander of Russian border guards, told Interfax that the acts 
of terror against his men had been committed on direct orders 
from the Tajik government-in-exile. 
  He believed that the Tajik opposition leaders intended to 
start a new round of hostilities and that opposition fighters 
were concentrating on the Afghan side of the Tajik-Afghan border 
for that purpose.

heads of the relevant ministries and departments and prominent 
scientists of the Tajik Academy of Sciences attended the 
meeting. It was pointed out in the meeting that the present 
concept of development of agriculture should be revised in the 
conditions of the present-day economic crisis of Tajikistan. 
  The absence of foreign loans makes the farmers rely only on 
the use of home resources. [words indistinct] With the purpose 
of revising the concept of development of agriculture of the

  [Text] Turkey occupies a special place among all countries 
with which Uzbekistan has good relations. This was stated by 
President Islam Karimov after his visit to Ankara. 
  He said that lately certain political forces have been 
dissatisfied with such a state of affairs. He added that 
everything promoting the country's growth and its international 
influence provokes their negative reaction. Karimov said these 
forces shadow relations with Turkey. 
  He said one of the main purposes of his visit to Turkey last 
week was to prove that Uzbekistan and Turkey are interested in 
each other. "I see Turkey as the closest, most reliable 
partner," the president stressed. 
  During the visit Karimov held talks with his counterpart 
Suleyman Demirel. The two sides signed a treaty on legal 
assistance in criminal, trade and civil cases and a protocol 
between the two foreign ministries on cooperation and mutual 
consultations. 
  Karimov urged Turkish businessmen to expand cooperation with 
partners in Uzbekistan and continue setting up joint ventures. 
(There are over 100 such mixed companies in Uzbekistan at the 
moment -- INTERFAX.)

  [Text] Riga, June 28, RIA -- Latvia's President Guntis 
Ulmanis and the government of that Baltic republic have agreed 
to return the citizenship law, passed by the Latvian parliament 
on June 21, to the legislature for amendment, Latvian Prime 
Minister Valdis Birkavs said in a televised statement on night. 
"We shall not allow the Latvian people to perish because of the 
citizenship law," he said. "We shall not allow this law to bar 
our way to Europe, the only place where Latvia can survive." 
  A special working group has been formed to amend the act. 
According to Mr. Birkavs, it is working on the formulas that 
will make Latvia's national interests compatible with the 
requirements of international organisations, especially the 
Council of Europe. The principle of quotas in granting 
citizenship is expected to be replaced by some other conditions 
for naturalisation. Specifically, the prime minister said that 
harsher language requirements will be made to the claimants for 
Latvian citizenship and a strict procedure will be established 
for naturalisation of non-citizens. 
  The amendments worked out by the working group will be 
submitted to the parliament, which is on holiday since june 23 
and is expected to resume its sessions right after U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's visit to Latvia on July 6.

  [Excerpt] Riga, Jun 27, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis plans to declare at 1400 on Tuesday at a press briefing 
if he will announce or not the citizenship law, and say about 
his stand in changing of customs tariffs, President's Office 
told BNS. 
  During his meeting with Aluksne inhabitants on Saturday, 
Ulmanis admitted that the citizenship law could be sent for 
repeated parliament consideration. 
  "I will ask the parliament to consider the citizenship law 
one more time so that the interests of the Latvian people as 
well as international norms were observed in it," said Ulmanis. 
  As reported, the Cabinet called the president not to 
announce 
the citizenship law, adopted on June 21, but send it for 
repeated parliament consideration. The law's article No. 14 
provides for the quota principle that allows to naturalize each 
year a number of citizens equal to 0.1 percent of the body of 
citizens, starting with the year 2000. 
  The naturalization quota principle endangers Latvia's 
enrollment in the Council of Europe [CE] and the very 
negotiations on the granting the CE associate member status to 
the Baltic country, and that poses a threat to Latvia's further 
integration into the European Union, according to the government 
statement. The quota principle also complicates Latvia's 
entrance into European collective security structures, the 
statement read. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Vilnius, June 27, ELTA -- Opposition leader 
Vytautas Landsbergis made a statement on the 
Lithuanian-Russian agreement on military transit. 
  Landsbergis claimed in his statement that "during the 
recent days some governmental statements on Russian military 
transit via Lithuania have caused great concerns". 
  Head of negotiation group Bulovas said that the agreement 
which had been proposed by Russia could be signed after two 
weeks when Lithuania established transit rules for 
dangerous and military cargoes. 
  According to the statement, "President thinks that transits 
for all partners should be legalized as soon as possible. As I 
can see no logics in such statements, they possibly 
include something that should be known by Lithuanian people 
before our country finds itself entangled into the Russian 
military system". 
  "Lithuanian labour democratic party has no mandate to 
condemn the whole nation", Landsbergis said.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- 2,800 men have been called 
up for mandatory service in the Lithuanian armed forces during 
this year's spring conscription. 
  Of all recruits who reported to medical boards, only 42 
percent were pronounced fit for military service, which is 
slightly more than last year. 
  More than 6,500 recruits did not report to call-up 
commissions. Approximately one-third of the number will have to 
pay fines of 118 lits ($30). Action will be brought against 30 
persons, who may face up to 2 years in prison for evading 
military service. 
  But the number of persons dodging military service decreased 
from 50 percent in 1993 to 38 percent this year. The level of 
education of recruits decreased, as well, with less than a half 
of this year's rookies being high school graduates.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- The European Union [EU] and 
Lithuania sign a preliminary free trade accord in Brussels 
Monday. 
  The agreement was initialed by Dalia Grybauskaite, director 
of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's Economics Division, and 
Daniel Gugenbul, who heads the EU's talks with Eastern and 
Central European countries. The procedure started at 1700 
Belgian time and lasted for quite a while because each of the 
agreement's 300 pages had to be signed in two copies, 
Grybauskaite said. 
  After initialing, the accord cannot be changed. The 
agreement is likely to be signed in early October and would come 
into force Jan. 1. 
  Lithuania became the second Baltic state to initial a free 
trade agreement with the EU. Latvia concluded a similar deal 
last week. Negotiations with Estonia are nearing completion.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas' popularity rating increased by 2 percent in 
June after a sharp drop in May, according to the results of a 
public opinion poll conducted June 8-15 by the 
British-Lithuanian Baltic Surveys. 
  But the survey indicates that Lithuanians continue to lose 
confidence in nearly all other political leaders, with the 
exception of the chairman of the opposition Conservative Party's 
board, Gediminas Vagnorius, whose rating jumped by 5 percent. 
Vagnorius is now ahead of Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius 
and the Conservative Party leader, Vytautas Landsbergis. 
  Centrists Egidijus Bickauskas and Romualdas Ozolas retained 
second and third positions. Like earlier, the popularity lists 
ends with Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys, even though his 
popularity went up by 1 percent. 
  According to the results, the most popular politicians in 
June were:

  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Lithuania's leftist daily 
TIESA (Truth) will change its name to DIENA (Day) July 1. 
  The newspaper's editor in chief, Domas Sniukas, said the 
decision to change the name was made by the board of the closed 
joint-stock company Tiesa. "Some supported and some were against 
the decision," Sniukas said. 
  TIESA was founded in 1917 as a communist paper. During 
post-war years it was the official newspaper of the Lithuanian 
Communist Party and was "reorganized" in 1990. 
  The newspaper represents the interests of the ruling 
Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. TIESA, with its daily 
circulation of 30,000, is the fourth biggest newspaper in 
Lithuania. It will have 24 pages starting July 1. 
  Sniukas said the paper will become livelier and popular with 
"more non-politics and non-economics." Professional skills of 
the 30-member staff is still the newspaper's main problem, he 
said. 
  In Sniukas' words, the daily will now pay more attention to 
sale but not subscription.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 530 ] </F>
  [Text] Vilnius, June 27, ELTA -- Seimas faction of 
Homeland's Union delivered a letter to Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas with the request for Brazauskas to appeal 
to the Constitutional Court to prevent the resolution of the 
government on selling private land. 
  The government made the resolution on selling private land 
in March, and Homeland's Union refused to agree with 
it. 
  According to the resolution, the boards of the districts 
were commissioned until August 1 to register permissions to buy 
2-3 hectare lots for those who would submit requests until July 
1. 
  Monitor of Homeland's Union Andrius Kubilius told a 
news conference that this resolution violated the Constitution. 
"The resolution denies the rights to the property of the former 
landowners", Kubilius maintained. 
  He also reminded that the state could not sell out 2-3 
hectare lots because it was not the owner of the land. The 
state had not bought the land from the owners. The law to 
allot 2-3 hectare lots for a certain category of people was 
passed by the Lithuanian Supreme Council in 1990. However, 
leaders of the opposition claimed that most of the lots were 
alloted illegally.

  [Text] Russia could become a "police state, and a very 
strong one" in response to growing crime rates, the settling of 
scores in politics and the absence of civilized civic 
institutions, Sergey Shakhray told Interfax. He said that the 
presidential anti-crime decree was one of the first signs of 
emergency legislation on the issue. 
  Shakhray believes that Russia is doomed to live through a 
period of extraordinary legislation. He says that in the 
struggle against banditry and organized crime there can be no 
place for competition between the State Duma, the president and 
other institutions of power. "They still have to pool their 
efforts," Shakhray said. 
  He said that a number of provisions in President Boris 
Yeltsin's decrees had been followed up upon in a draft law 
approved by the government and submitted to parliament for 
approval. The future law would "dramatically enhance 
responsibility for both committing and organizing crimes." 
  "The basic human right is the right to life and the safety 
of 
children and the family. All other rights must be made 
subordinate to that right," he said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- The removal of Nikolay 
Medvedev from the post of head of the presidential 
administration's department for work with regions was prompted 
by "mistakes in crucial directions," President Boris Yeltsin's 
Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Filatov said that 
"Nikolay Medvedev is strong in many fields, he is a serious 
analyst. However the preparation of a draft law on local 
self-government had practically failed in the last few months 
although the regional leaders were assured that the document 
would be submitted to the State Duma shortly. But real work on 
it is only beginning." 
  Filatov stressed that Medvedev had failed to establish close 
cooperation with the presidential representatives in Russian 
provinces. Additionally, the removal of Bryansk Region 
administration head Yuriy Lodkin had developed into a conflict 
which could have been avoided in order not to "discredit 
authorities in the eyes of the population," Filatov said. 
  He added that Medvedev's successor Aleksey Kazakov "knows 
the 
regions well owing to his work in the state property management 
committee."

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- "During the discussion of the 
president's decree on the protection of the population from 
organised crime and the drive against bandits it became clear 
that the majority of society regards the decree as the necessary 
measure to curb crime in Russia," said Presidential Chief of 
Staff Sergey Filatov, commenting on the president's decree which 
took effect on Monday. 
  As for the opinion of a commissioner for human rights, 
Sergey 
Kovalev, who suggested that the president should recall his 
decree, Filatov said that "his position, strengthened by his 
experience as a human rights advocator, deserves respect." 
  Nevertheless, Filatov said "we believe that we shall manage 
to avoid abuse as regards the rights of an individual when 
applying the president's anti-crime decree." Filatov's opinion 
is shared by the general prosecutor's office which shall 
exercise control over its implementation. "Any incident when a 
suspect is detained should be registered in a protocol and its 
legitimacy is subject to control. An investigation is already 
under way into 17 incidents of detention without sufficient 
grounds, which is also a guarantee of the protection of the 
rights of an individual. Besides, the decree applies only to 
the most violent crimes," Filatov said. 
  "We do not live in totalitarian society. Such a powerful 
weapon as the freedom of speech will be a counterbalance to any 
encroachments on citizens' rights," Filatov said. 
  Filatov pointed out that his worst apprehensions were caused 
by the blending of the criminal world and the world of 
officials. "This "knot" might become a means of settling scores 
with "unwanted" people, which cannot be allowed. The decree on 
the fight against bandits puts a barrier to this dangerous 
process," Filatov said in conclusion.

  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
met members of the Russian Agrarian Party group in the Kremlin 
today. The deputies briefed the president on their group's 
organizational structure and its numerical strength, as well as 
on their political positions, which they describe as centrist. 
The conversation was devoted to problems of the agro-industrial 
complex. 
  Having noted his full awareness of the difficulties Russian 
agriculture was experiencing, the president stressed the need to 
develop the agro-industrial complex taking account of the 
overall strategy of the country's economic reforms. 
  It was agreed to continue contacts between presidential 
structures and the State Duma's groups, including the Agrarian 
Party group, to prepare agreed decisions, the Russian 
president's press service told ITAR-TASS.

  [Text] Russia's agriculture should be reformed on the basis 
of freedom to choose form of property, Russian Presidential 
Advisor Georgy Satarov told Interfax Monday commenting on the 
results of Boris Yeltsin's meeting with the leaders of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia and its parliamentary faction this 
afternoon. He cited Yeltsin as saying that no imposition could 
be exercised in this issue. 
  The presidential press office said that Yeltsin had pointed 
out that he was aware of the difficulties faced by Russia's 
agriculture. He pointed to the importance of developing the 
agroindustrial complex taking into account the general strategy 
of the country's economic reforms. 
  The meeting was attended by the leader of the Agrarian Party 
and its parliamentary faction, Mikhail Lapshin, and a group of 
agrarian deputies. 
  Satarov said the participants of the meeting came to the 
conclusion that such meetings should be held regularly as they 
promoted the process of "joint shaping up a balanced policy for 
agrarian reforms in Russia."

<F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Newly Created Entity" </F>
rubric: "Yet Another Movement Wants To Struggle for Accord and 
To Restore Russian Peoples to Honor and Dignity"] 
  [Excerpts] Yet another public-political movement, named 
the Assembly of National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of the 
Russian Federation [ANDPF], which came into being last weekend, 
will strive for civil peace and interethnic accord, something 
only the lazy have not urged. 
  The Assembly, as designed by its founders, will bring 
together ethnic organizations, ethnic-cultural associations, 
parties, movements, and individuals, after which it will 
coordinate their actions "in the area of ethnic relations, 
political and socioeconomic transformations" and will establish 
"interethnic communication in civilized forms" upon defining 
"the common interests of the peoples of the Russian Federation." 
  The all-Russian assembly was convened at the initiative of 
the Assembly of the North Caucasus Democratic Forces under 
general secretary Shmidt Dzoblayev, which has already been 
operating as part of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement 
[RDRM]. According to the organizing committee, the initiative 
was supported by 64 regions. Only 43 credentials, however, were 
handed at the constituent congress: not all regional 
representatives could put aside their business to make a trip to 
Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  The congress was attended by Mr. Popov [not further 
identified], who in his salutary address on behalf of the RDRM 
at the very beginning wished the Assembly successful work, and 
then left the hall. There were no more well-known politicians 
at the congress, nor was there any particular need for their 
presence because the Assembly, Shmidt Dzoblayev said, was 
created "from the bottom up" and "does not rush to show its 
sympathies for one party or another." 
  Recognizing the protection of individual rights as the new 
movement's priority, the founding delegates chartered the 
vectors of its political and economic strategy as they 
envisioned a possible way "toward interethnic accord through the 
revival of national honor and dignity." Pointing out that the 
current interethnic conflicts are in reality "conflicts between 
regional and federal authorities over the distribution of 
property," the delegates set their sights on a "constitutional 
federation," in which "national-territorial entities will not 
divide citizens into `indigenous' and `non-indigenous,' and the 
federal authorities will be entitled to "remove from office a 
regional chief if he fails to take measures to stop ethnic 
discrimination." If this does not help, "oxygen should be cut 
off to the regions by imposing economic sanctions." 
  The Assembly's economic program has so far been limited to 
the recognition of "the need for the state regulation of the 
economy" and will be definitively outlined sometime toward next 
winter at the movement's first congress. 
  The hours-long discussion of the plans resulted in the 
adoption of a program statement describing regional problems "as 
a matter of particular concern for the authorities and the 
public," and also amendments and additions to the charter. In 
conclusion, the Assembly founders elected a political council -- 
the ruling body between congresses, which will subsequently 
elect from its members a bureau that will govern the 
organization between meetings of the political council. The 
constituent congress also elected an executive committee and an 
auditing commission. Shmidt Dzoblayev was unanimously elected 
general secretary of yet another assembly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Manilov, deputy secretary of the </F>
Russian Federation Security Council, by Aleksandr Pelts; place 
and date not given: "Valeriy Manilov: Russia's Well-Being Is 
the Supreme Criterion"] 
  [Text] From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA files: Lieutenant General 
Valeriy Leonidovich Manilov is a candidate of philosophical 
sciences. He was born in 1939 in a serviceman's family. He 
served in the Odessa and Transbaykal Military Districts and with 
the Southern Group of Forces. He took part in military 
operations in Afghanistan. He is a graduate of the General 
Staff Military Academy. He headed the USSR Ministry of Defense 
Information Directorate and the CIS Joint Armed Forces 
Information Service. At present he is deputy secretary of the 
Russian Federation Security Council. 
  [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the Security Council's 
functions are so extensive that at times it is compared with the 
former [CPSU Central Committee] Politburo. How objective is 
this comparison? 
  [Manilov] I have heard of such comparisons. But let me 
remind you of an old truism: All comparisons are 
unsatisfactory. The Security Council's powers and functions are 
indeed extensive, but it is fundamentally different from the 
aforementioned structure. It is a constitutional organ, formed 
and headed by the country's president. Furthermore, it does not 
exercise any executive-administrative functions. Its main task 
is to prepare presidential decisions in the sphere of ensuring 
security. It considers and resolves strategic problems 
associated with domestic, foreign, and military policy in this 
sphere, defines Russia's national interests and the basic 
guidelines for their protection, and performs a series of other 
tasks. 
  [Pelts] Does the Security Council perform any coordinating 
and monitoring functions? 
  [Manilov] Of course. The Security Council coordinates the 
activity of organs of state power in the process of implementing 
their own decisions and the edicts and directives of the Russian 
Federation president as regards ensuring security. I would like 
to emphasize that it coordinates in terms of objectives rather 
than of functions, in other words without interfering in the 
day-to-day activity of ministries and departments. As for 
monitoring, it extends to the implementation of Security Council 
decisions and of the president's edicts on security questions. 
The Security Council's secretary and apparatus have been given 
powers to organize inspections of the efficiency of the 
implementation of these decisions by ministries and departments. 
  [Pelts] How, in your view, could one define the Security 
Council's position and role in our society? 
  [Manilov] It is an organ ensuring the exercise of the 
Russian president's functions as regards running the state in 
the security sphere. Hence its position in the state hierarchy. 
The paramount task of the Security Council is to preserve 
Russia's state sovereignty, maintain sociopolitical stability in 
society, and defend citizens' rights and freedoms. This is in 
line with the vital interests of all Russians, regardless of 
their social status and party-political orientation. Hence the 
Security Council's essentially consolidating role in our society. 
  [Pelts] Is this role manifest in some specific way in the 
work of the Security Council itself and of its apparatus? 
  [Manilov] Of course, and quite graphically at that. The 
Security Council synthesizes the intellect, will, and experience 
of people, each one of whom plays a key role in his own field as 
regards the implementation and protection of Russia's 
national-state interests. Look no further than the Security 
Council's composition. This synthesis actually produces a 
statewide policy. Since Russia's interests and its well-being 
are the supreme criterion of the Security Council's work, there 
is no room for any departmental or group interests in the 
practical activity of its apparatus. This is our creed. Let me 
note with gratification that this creed is essentially shared by 
all with whom we work in the closest possible business contacts. 
  [Pelts] And who are they, if it is no secret? 
  [Manilov] They make up a very broad circle. The service of 
aides, the main structures of the president's staff, the 
committees and commissions of the Federal Assembly chambers, the 
government apparatus, representatives of ministries and 
departments and primarily of those headed by Security Council 
members, scientific research organizations, and public 
associations. 
  [Pelts] How do you ensure the objectivity of information 
supplied to the president and other Council members? 
  [Manilov] This is indeed a very important aspect. The sole 
correct decision can be adopted only on the basis of 
comprehensive analysis of the fullest and best possible 
information. The mechanism used here is simultaneously simple 
and complex. Under the law we have the right to co-opt any 
state structure capable of acquiring. accumulating, and 
analyzing information, as well as the information and analysis 
organs of all "power" departments, state and scientific centers, 
and nongovernmental organizations. Briefly, whenever necessary 
we can call on the entire information and analysis potential 
available in the country in the process of preparing proposals, 
recommendations, and decisions on security questions. 
  [Pelts] Who determines the questions to be discussed at 
Security Council sittings? 
  [Manilov] We use the following method. The Security Council 
secretary submits proposals, taking into account the opinions of 
Security Council members. They are considered and approved by 
the president. 
  [Pelts] There is obviously a plan for the Security Council's 
work. 
  [Manilov] Yes. Naturally. But life frequently introduces 
its own amendments. There are occasions when an apparently 
routine question turns into a most acute problem demanding 
solution at the highest level. At other times, when a scheduled 
question is being discussed at a Security Council sitting, it 
emerges that other equally important questions arise from it.... 
  [Pelts] And how do you manage to keep this mass of problems 
under control? 
  [Manilov] Primarily by setting priorities. You cannot 
embrace the boundless, as Kozma Prutkov said. And he was right. 
The important point is to single out the main ones from among 
the broadest spectrum of problems and concentrate efforts on 
their solution. A major role in this selection process is 
played by the system of interdepartmental commissions which are 
the Security Council's basic working organs. This system also 
includes the Scientific Council recently set up under the 
Security Council, which provides scientific backup for the 
decisions, recommendations, and forecasts being prepared. This 
system makes it possible to "stick to" the general avenues of 
ensuring security while retaining room for maneuver. The 
commissions are headed by senior officials appointed by the 
Russian Federation president. They are, as a rule, ministers or 
first deputy ministers. The commissions coordinate 
horizontally, as it were, the interests and positions of 
ministries and departments. 
  [Pelts] Judging by the scale of the tasks being solved, the 
Security Council apparatus must be quite sizeable? 
  [Manilov] The apparatus employs, in addition to technical 
personnel, just over 100 people. They are mainly highly skilled 
professionals capable of effectively performing tasks in the 
interests of ensuring Russia's security at all levels. 
  [Pelts] Security at all levels.... How many such levels are 
there? 
  [Manilov] Three in principle: the security of individuals, 
the security of society, and the security of the state. They 
are, of course, inseparable, interlinked, and interconnected. 
And they are all matters of priority. Nonetheless, the 
security of the individual is the starting point. 
Unfortunately, uncertainty is a typical feature of our life 
today. Many people are losing sight of their reference points. 
This is frightening. It is, therefore, vitally important to 
ensure that everyone knows and actually senses that society and 
the state are concerned about his interests and security. 
  [Pelts] But in order to achieve this, it is probably 
necessary to resolve certain specific questions? 
  [Manilov] You are right. Lev Tolstoy remarked that it is 
easy to love the whole world, but just try and love some 
specific person.... There is a multitude of specific questions, 
including some which, at first glance, do not appear to concern 
statewide interests but are tackled by the Security Council 
apparatus as part of its work. From this viewpoint, the 
questions raised at Security Council sittings are just the 
visible tip of the iceberg. 
  [Pelts] The Security Council's composition has been changed 
on several occasions in the recent past. What is this -- a sign 
of a quest for a "better team?" 
  [Manilov] I think that this formulation of the question is 
incorrect. Presidential edicts have effected certain changes in 
the Security Council's composition -- this is correct. They 
have been prompted by life. Gaydar, Fedorov, and Golushko have 
departed. Stepashin, Shoygu, and Nikolayev have joined the 
Security Council. In my view, the president's decisions on 
their appointments need no comment. These people represent the 
most important avenues for ensuring Russia's national security. 
Federal Assembly chamber leaders Shumeyko and Rybkin recently 
became members of the Security Council. This is in line with 
the letter and spirit of the Treaty on Social Accord, with the 
nationwide and statewide nature and scale of responsibility for 
the fatherland's security. 
  [Pelts] Valeriy Leonidovich, the question "On the Concept of 
Russia's National Security" ranks last in the Security Council's 
work plan. Why is this? Is it possible to speak of ensuring 
security if there is no concept of it? 
  [Manilov] The important point is to ensure rather than to 
talk about ensuring. And this should be done now, today, not 
tomorrow or the day after. Therefore, the elaboration of the 
concept is progressing in parallel with the creation of a 
security system and the mechanisms ensuring its effective 
operation. Certain fragments of the general concept have already 
been elaborated and adopted by the Security Council -- those 
concerning the foreign policy and defense spheres. Others are 
being elaborated simultaneously with the general concept. 
Bearing this in mind, it has been planned to consider it at a 
Security Council sitting toward year's end. The main point is 
that this work is being done within the framework of a unified 
scheme whose core is to guarantee the ensuring of the protection 
of Russia's national-state interests.

  [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin dispelled fears of major foreign corporations about high 
risks of investing into Russia and predicted that stability will 
last in the country at least until the next presidential 
elections in 1996. 
  Yeltsin told a meeting with major foreign investors on 
Tuesday that their fear to work in Russia is "outdated". "The 
recent months were the most quiet in political sense during the 
whole period of reforms in Russia", the president said and 
expressed conviction that stability will continue to dominate. 
  Only before the presidential elections in 1996 "a certain 
political fuss" can occur, he added. 
  The president underlined that the wave of strikes has gone 
down in Russia of late. "Which of your countries has no strikes 
at present? There is no such country, only Russia", he said. 
  Yeltsin welcomed the arrival of major Western businessmen to 
Moscow to participate in the work of the Council on Foreign 
Investments. 
  "You can see for yourselves what the situation in Russia 
is", 
the president said. 
  The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and heads of such major companies as ABB, BASF, 
Citicorp, Coca-Cola, Ernst and Young and others.

  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- "We are all for directing the 
main financial streams flowing from abroad into Russia right 
into the investment sphere", Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin announced on Monday, speaking at a meeting of the 
Russian Government Consultative Council for Foreign Investments, 
which he chairs. 
  Chernomyrdin commented on upcoming legislation which 
regulates the functioning of and privileges for businesses with 
foreign investment. 
  According to the premier, the draft laws include a series of 
major changes in the tax code for foreign investors. It is 
proposed to free enterprises with foreign capital from the 
profit tax for five years after registration, to remove the 
limitations on capital movement, and to give foreign investors 
(meaning businesses 100 per cent funded by foreign capital) the 
right to own land if they construct a new building or expand 
production. 
  In addition, businesses with foreign capital will be able to 
keep all the profit in foreign currency which they receive by 
exporting goods they produce in Russia. The import of machines, 
technological equipment, spare parts, raw materials, and 
component parts for production uses will not be subject to taxes 
or customs duties.

  [Text] Russian Vice Prime Minister, Economics Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin has said that Russia is offering foreign 
investors lease of and concessions for exploiting fuel and raw 
materials sites, land, forests and setting up joint ventures to 
process natural resources and agricultural products. 
  Speaking at the constituent conference of a consultative 
council on foreign investments in Moscow Monday, he pointed out 
that creating a climate of trust in investment cooperation with 
foreign countries was one of the main conditions for Russia's 
involvement in the world economic order. 
  Shokhin put special emphasis on the fact that the Russian 
government took into account foreign investors' opinion with 
respect to the instability of Russian legislation. The 
government has suspended the practices of legislating and 
shaping up their own investment policies by individual 
ministries and agencies, which would facilitate their relations 
with foreign partners. At the same time, investors' proposals 
on lessening investment risks were being considered, and 
specific measures guaranteeing foreign investments from changes 
in the legislation were being taken. 
  "We support creating a system for international arbitration 
which would enable Russia and its partners to solve their 
differences in a civilized way," Shokhin said. 
  According to Shokhin, the government planned to set up a 
centralized collateral fund of federal property and create 
analogous structures in the federation items in order to attract 
foreign capital. This autumn, the government will consider 
regulations for pledging land, underground, forest and other 
natural resources as securities and retaining pawned property. 
  To facilitate the search for and assessment of potential 
business partners, especially outside Moscow, a list of 
investment projects with participation of foreign capital was 
prepared. The list includes more than 500 entries each of them 
is a specific project supplemented with brief business plans, 
Shokhin said.

  [Text] Since the very beginning of the reforms Russia has 
regarded foreign aid as crucial. As a result of this incorrect 
orientation internal sources were not used to stimulate economic 
and investment activities, Russian First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets said at the constituent meeting of a consultative 
council on foreign investments under the Russian government 
today. 
  He said the total volume of foreign investment in Russia 
remained very small and did not conform with the capacities and 
needs of the country. "According to expert evaluations, only 
about 0.1 percent of foreign investments in the world is being 
placed into Russia," Soskovets said. 
  The Russian government realizes that during the next five 
years the economic reforms in Russia will make Russian small and 
medium enterprises the main source of new jobs, Soskovets said. 
  However, Soskovets said there was quite a number of negative 
tendencies in the development of small business. Today there 
are only about 700 enterprises performing in the sphere of small 
business and there should be at least 2.5 million or 3.5 million 
of them. 
  Soskovets said that small business in Russia was not 
receiving enough support on the part of Western capital. He 
added that only the $300 million-credit given to Russia by the 
European Bank was the most significant one allotted by the West 
to Russian small and medium business. Soskovets said he hoped 
that the problems concerning the attraction of Western capital 
to Russia would be settled by the consultative council on 
foreign investments headed by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.

  [Text] Foreign investments in enterprises on Russian soil 
at the end of 1993 amounted to $2.7 billion and 4.8 billion 
rubles (this includes ruble investments in joint ventures with 
CIS member nations and reinvested rubles). Yakov Urinson, first 
deputy economics minister, told a meeting, held in Moscow 
Monday, of the advisory council on investment policy which 
reports to the government that direct investments (which enable 
the investors to share in the management and made up more than 
10 percent of the enterprise equity capital) accounted for 85 
percent of the total, or for $2.3 billion and 4.3 billion 
rubles. Portfolio investments (which accounted for less than 10 
percent of the equity capital and do not enable the investors to 
share in the management) accounted for as little as 3 percent of 
the entire amount, 70 million dollars. Other kinds of investment 
such as trading credits and financial leasing were equal to $282 
million and 437 million rubles. 
  According to the Russian Economics Ministry, the largest 
share of foreign investments, 23 percent, was made in the 
engineering industry and metal working, followed by the fuel 
industry, 15 percent, trade and catering, 14 percent, 
construction, 6 percent and timber and pulp and cellulose 
industries, 5 percent. 
  The ministry reported that foreign investments increased by 
$1.36 billion and 4.1 billion rubles in 1993.

    [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1620 GMT on 27 June carries in its "Details" program 
an 8-minute recorded interview with Viktor Gerashchenko, 
chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, conducted by anchorman 
Nikolay Svanidze. 
  Asked to comment on the present priorities of the Ministry 
of 
Finance, Gerashchenko says: "The Ministry of Finance will have 
to be rather strict in its budget spending and to allocate 
credits only to those industries whose survival -- with help or 
subsidies from the state -- is dictated precisely by state 
interests." 
  Asked to qualify the financial policy carried out at present 
by the Central Bank, Gerashchenko says: "Well, first of all, 
there must be a certain degree of firmness in the light of the 
constant barrage of requests from various industries, who 
sometimes stick to old habits and keep on asking for money from 
both the government and the Central Bank. At the same time we 
must be aware that in certain instances there are industries 
which must be supported by our economic policy, and that it 
would be unwise for us to leave our traditional distribution 
markets in both near abroad and other countries. This requires 
certain measures of encouragement, the introduction of certain 
protectionist measures or subsidies. 
  "The Directors' Council took a decision as early as last 
year 
to limit to 12 percent the share of foreign capital within the 
capital of commercial banks operating on the Russian territory. 
Certain protectionism is needed here." 
  Asked how the bank's policy corresponds to the presidential 
edict, Gerashchenko says: "Completely." 
  The program concludes with a lengthy comment by Nikolay 
Svanidze on the need for a certain cohesion between the bank's 
"elegant" financial policy and the elegance of its premises. 
The bank is now in the process of a complete revamp of its 
so-called small conference room in an "imperial epic style". 
Painter Ilya Glazunov has been approached and he proposed to 
paint a huge portrait of Czar Aleksandr II signing a decree on 
the establishment of the Central Bank of Russia. The bank had 
its doubts and has backed off from the project.

  [Text] The Russian government will stick to a strict 
financial policy in 1995, though the country has overcome 
hyperinflation, acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin told a 
meeting of the government consultative council for foreign 
investments Monday. 
  According to Dubinin, the monthly inflation rate will fall 
from 8-10 percent to 2.5-3 percent at the end of 1995. 
Production growth, if any, will take place no earlier than the 
end of next year. 
  Dubinin informed the meeting of proposals to ease the tax 
climate being prepared. He said some taxes, including VAT 
(currently at 20 percent), would be reduced, and the entire list 
of taxes to be levied in 1995 would be reviewed. 
  The finance ministry is considering emission of stocks which 
could be used for payment of taxes, Dubinin said. He added that 
the government would use a number of tax privileges in order to 
attract foreign investments to the top-priority industries.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Yarov report under "Detention" rubric: "The </F>
Zhirinovskiyites Have Been Entangled Somewhat in Swindling 
Operations. An Intermediary Between the LDPR and GMM Has Been 
Caught in an Attempt To Defraud a Bank" -- last three paragraphs 
are commentary by Mikhail Leontyev] 
  [Text] As SEGODNYA's correspondents have learned from 
reliable sources, over the past weekend the economic crime unit 
of Moscow's Southwestern Okrug uncovered and prevented a major 
financial fraud. According to the police, on 3 May [as 
published] two young men tried to obtain a credit of 600 million 
rubles at Perm and Samara banks, producing documents from the 
First Federal Bank and Transkredit-bank. An investigation 
showed that the businessmen had used forged documents, and they 
were soon detained on suspicion of fraud. The two men are 
Kazachenko, 25, unemployed; and Travkin, who described himself 
as an LDPR assistant deputy chairman in charge of international 
affairs. During a search $231,000 in cash was confiscated from 
the detainees, as well as four copiers, a Remington pump gun, 
and two hand weapons. We shall report more on the case in one 
of our next issues. 
  Especially interesting in this apparently banal crime story 
is the fact that it is linked directly to reports of the 
Zhirinovskiy party's being financed by certain subcriminal 
groups, notably the well-known "Dutch trust company GMM," owned 
by Nenakhov. According to information from responsible sources, 
the above Maksim Travkin, who earlier worked for Nenakhov, was 
an initial link in "informal" financial relations between GMM 
and the LDPR. 
  The emergence of Travkin as adviser to the LDPR deputy 
chairman for international affairs (Aleksey Mitrofanov, who is 
the next link in the same chain), as well as in lists of 
Zhirinovskiy party official parliamentary delegations, coincided 
with Zhirinovskiy's open lobbying in favor of GMM. It is enough 
to recall the LDPR leader's letter to the premier asking to rein 
in financial bodies ostensibly hampering the activity of a 
well-reputed company, and also his letters to state TV companies 
demanding that they resume GMM advertising, which was suspended 
following a letter from the Ministry of Finance. (Incidentally, 
Zhirinovskiy's letter for some reason produced an impression 
only on the Russian TV and Radio Company, which fulfilled his 
instructions diligently). 
  As for the information about an attempt to obtain credit 
with 
false documents from the First Federal Bank, the meaning of 
"false" is yet to be clarified. The fact is that this bank is 
simply one of the semi-fictitious legal entities organized by 
Nenakhov. His firm's accounts have been seized by the tax 
authorities, which serves as legal cause for refusing to return 
money to GMM clients.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Zhagel: "Foreign Trade Bank of Russia Will </F>
Now be One-Third Owned by Gazprom"] 
  [Text] A Foreign Trade Bank of Russia [Vneshtorgbank] 
stockholders meeting has admitted a number of new members, among 
them the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company. The latter's contribution 
to the bank's incorporation capital is $170 million. 
  What we are seeing happening before our very eyes is the 
rapid transformation of what used to be a narrowly specialized 
sectoral enterprise engaged in the extraction and transport of 
gas into Russia's largest financial and industrial group, whose 
interests are beginning to extend to all spheres of economic 
life. 
  IZVESTIYA recently reported on Gazprom's desire to become 
involved in the delivery of energy resources in the European 
market direct to the consumer, the construction in Germany of 
its own pipeline, and the acquisition of real estate there worth 
1.7 billion German marks. Now there are these new facts, 
providing evidence of Gazprom's penetration of the banking 
sector. 
  Incidentally, the $170 million in incorporation capital 
means 
that Russia's largest commercial bank will now be more than 
one-third owned by the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company. This is a 
very appetising morsel, especially if you bear in mind that the 
bank specializes in foreign economic operations and controls a 
considerable proportion of them. As Russian Vneshtorgbank 
Chairman Yuriy Poletayev said, they now service approximately 30 
percent of the country's entire foreign trade turnover. 
  The Russian Vneshtorgbank is also an appetising morsel 
because last year, for example, it made a profit of 178.2 
billion rubles [R], or an increase of 9.4-fold. In the first 
five months of this year alone, the bank's profit was R162 
billion. Of course, a major contributory factor to the growth 
of all the bank's indicators was that in 1993 a vast number of 
the former clients of the USSR Vneshekonombank, some of its 
largest ones, furthermore, brought their business here. They 
thus brought money and lucrative operations and ensured a rapid 
increase in revenue. 
  However, the fact that Gazprom has become a shareholder in 
the Vneshtorgbank does not mean that the joint-stock company 
will henceforth trample the bank underfoot. On the contrary, it 
will go at least a small way toward balancing out the influence 
of the state, which, in the form of the Russian Central Bank, 
previously held more than 90 percent of the incorporation 
capital and, of course, was able to exert a definite influence 
on the bank's leadership. Furthermore, none of the other 
shareholders was physically able to invest in the incorporation 
capital a sum large enough to significantly reduce the state's 
share. Only Gazprom has managed to do that. 
  It is interesting that, in Yu. Poletayev's words, the 
Central 
Bank's contribution to the Vneshtorgbank's incorporation capital 
consisted of 50 tonnes of gold, which for a long time lay in the 
vaults like a dead weight, and it was only recently that the 
bank was given permission to send the gold abroad, where it 
began to work and bring the bank revenue. But it is also 
equally interesting that when last year's profit was 
distributed, the Central Bank received nothing -- its gold 
deposit was not put to work last year and thus did not earn 
anything.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Practically one in a hundred 
Russians is unemployed or is registered by the state employment 
agency as "not being occupied by working activity," i.e, 
jobless. Most of the Russian unemployed are women and unskilled 
workers, since those are the ones most often laid off. 
  Statistics show that there are almost one and a half million 
jobless in Russia now. One million 219 thousand of them had 
been officially recognized as unemployed. Two out of every 
three people on the dole are former unskilled labourers. 
  Women are the unluckiest of all in the job market. 
Two-thirds of the jobless are women. Moreover, the youngest 
seem to suffer disproportionately: every third is in the 16-29 
age group.

  [Text] Claims that Russia is concealing information about 
chemical weapons are "totally groundless". Such a statement was 
made in an interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday by the Foreign 
Ministry's Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin following accusations made 
in the course of congressional hearings in the U.S. recently. 
  He reported that in keeping with an intergovernmental 
memorandum on chemical agents, Russia and U.S. had exchanged 
data on their military and chemical potentials in May. 
  "This data is being studied and analyzed in Russia and the 
U.S. after which, in accordance with the memorandum, each 
country will carry out five inspections of the other country's 
facilities. This will enable them to make sure that the data is 
correct," Karasin said. 
  He said Russian experts note that the information received 
from the American side needs to be clarified. 
  "We believe that the proper channels of interaction should 
be 
used if these doubts are to be removed."

  [Text] A reception in honor of graduates of Russia's 
military academies was held in the Kremlin today. The Russian 
president spoke at it. Touching upon problems of the military 
reform, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin said the following: 
  [Begin Yeltsin recording] The main area of our military 
policy is reform of the armed forces. They should meet the 
actual requirements needed for sufficient national defene. 
Gradually, and I stress here, gradually, the strength of the 
army will be reduced and brought down to 1.5 million servicemen. 
The mechanism for building the army up to its required strength 
will also undergo gradual changes. There is talk about 
increasing the share of servicemen undergoing military service 
on contracts. We will continue to devote much attention to 
developing the new military infrastructure in Russia and 
providing it with everything necessary as quickly as possible. 
We need to learn how to implement a balanced military-technical 
policy. The root of the problem is that tasks we tackle should 
correspond to the actual possibilities of the country's economy. 
  It is no secret that today our funds are limited and that 
this is sharply reflected on the army. This is why it is even 
more important to allocate these funds wisely. We will have to 
reduce the number of various types of weapons and their 
modifications, material support for them, the range of 
ammunition, supplies, and spare parts. Multiplicity is an 
unacceptable luxury right now. We need unification. At the 
same time, it is also categorically unacceptable to waste in the 
name of arms reduction a unique scientific and technical 
potential created by the armed forces. There are international 
treaties and agreements, and we will honestly fulfill the 
responsibilities which we had taken upon ourselves. But any 
so-called overdoing on our part is totally out of question. 
This is a clear position taken by the president, and the 
supreme commander in chief, and this is a demand of principle 
to the leadership of the armed forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Manushkin report under "Alarm Signal" rubric: </F>
"Trade Unions Prepare for Strike"] 
  [Text] The second (extraordinary) conference of the 
All-Russia Defense Industry Workers Trade Union took place 21 
June in Moscow. The conference participants described the 
current situation in the defense sector as critical. Not only 
has the slump in the production of both military and civilian 
output not been halted but, on the contrary, it is snowballing. 
While it was 34.3 percent in January 1994 compared with the 
corresponding month last year at constant prices, it was 48.7 
percent in April. In April the rate of decrease of production 
in the civilian sector (49.1 percent) exceeded the fall in 
military production (47.6 percent) for the first time. 
  The wave of stoppages at enterprises and production 
facilities is swelling. Ten of the sector's 176 enterprises 
have stopped work completely and 123 are working an incomplete 
working day or week, and 284,000 people are on enforced leave. 
The low level of wages (30,000-40,000 rubles at a number of 
enterprises), delays in paying them, the massive nature of job 
cuts, and the destruction of enterprises' social sphere are 
causing dissatisfaction and an increase in tension in labor 
collectives. 
  The conference demanded that legal action be taken against 
officials of state administration organs for the long delays in 
paying for products manufactured under state orders and 
consequently for the late payment of wages to defense 
enterprises' workers. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported on the sector trade 
union's picketing of the Russian Government building and on 
defense sector working people's rallies accompanied by a 
10-15-minute stoppage of the production of civilian output, 
which were held in April-June. The defense industry trade union 
is now deciding the question of holding a one-day strike 
accompanied by economic and political demands.

  [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG" dailies), 06/28/94--Russian 
President's Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov arrived from Baku 
to Yerevan yesterday, to continue negotiations on peaceful 
resolution of the Karabakh problem. 
  Kazimirov met the President of the Republic of Armenia Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan. Russian President's envoy declared after the 
meeting that he is satisfied by working negotiations in Baku and 
Yerevan, and feels that Armenians and Azeris are really 
interested in establishing peace. 
  "Baku seriously wishes to facilitate the preparatory work on 
signing a political agreement to stop the military conflict," 
said Kazimirov. 
  He stressed that opposing the CSCE and Russian projects 
would 
be erroneous, and several topics of the CSCE project were also 
included in the Russian plan. 
  "We can find many similarities though there are some 
differences," said Kazimirov. "If CSCE only offers a schedule 
of measures, Russia is attempting to stipulate signing a legal 
inter-state document on stopping the conflict. This is the 
first difference, the second is that the Russian plan has better 
developed mechanisms of cease fire, reducing the danger of 
resumption of military operations to a minimum." In his opinion, 
CSCE Minsk group's schedule doesn't stipulate such mechanisms. 
  Questioned whether CSCE may become an obstacle to 
implementation of the Russian mediation efforts Kazimirov said, 
he wouldn't like to believe this and hopes that Chairman of the 
CSCE Minsk group Eliasson will continue to collaborate. 
  Answering the question on when the agreement will be signed, 
Kazimirov said that they are ready to sign it tomorrow, but 
readiness of the conflicting sides is also required. Paying 
importance to Stepanakert's opinion Russian president's envoy 
said he was unable to visit Karabakh this time due to 
unfavorable weather conditions, but he hopes such a possibility 
will be created in the nearest future. 
  Kazimirov will leave to Baku and from there to Ankara today, 
to continue the negotiations. "I find the meetings in Teheran 
and future meetings in Ankara very important, as these countries 
are situated in the region and military operations are carried 
up to the Iranian border zone," he said. At the same time 
Kazimirov rejected the notion that a new form of regional 
resolution of the Karabakh conflict has been created. 
  Presidential spokesman Levon Zurabyan said in turn, 
commenting on Kazimirov's visit, it is still too early to speak 
on signing any documents or a significant progress. 
Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that lull, established at 
the fronts, will be supported by a corresponding legal document.

  [Text] Yerevan June 28 TASS -- Russian presidential envoy 
to Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov is leaving Baku for 
Ankara on Tuesday to hold talks with Turkish authorities on the 
disputed enclave. 
  Speaking in Yerevan on Monday Kazimirov said that the talks 
"are routine consultations which have no sensations or special 
turns". 
  The envoy rejected the idea that contacts with Turkey and 
Iran "create a new format for talks in the regional aspect". He 
said his recent trip to Tehran and the upcoming visit to Ankara 
are made in return to the talks of diplomats of the two 
countries recently held in Moscow. 
  Kazimirov recalled that combat activities had been held 
right 
on the Iranian border with Azerbaijan going along the Arax 
river. He said this was a "very aggravating circumstance" which 
can make the conflict spread to other countries. "that is why 
the position of iran is an important factor and we take it into 
consideration", the envoy stressed.

  [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "LRAGIR" dailies), 06/28/94--The 
situation at the Karabakh fronts remains unchanged. 
  According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] 
defense army headquarters, the Azeri units continue shelling the 
Karabakh defense positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy 
districts. The Karabakh units have been refraining from 
returning the fire. 
  RMK military reconnaissance reports significant 
concentration 
and movements of the Azeri manpower and equipment in the 
direction of the settlement of Agburun in the Martuninskiy 
district. 
  "The RMK National Security Department has reliable 
information about a new offensive, being prepared against 
Karabakh by Azerbaijan," said Chairman of the department Kamo 
Abrahamyan. He reported that new army summons have started in 
Azerbaijan a few days ago. Men of different age groups are 
called up to the army. At the same time, new batches of 
weaponry, ammunition and food are being received from Turkey and 
Ukraine. This all, as well as regrouping of enemy forces at the 
fronts is evidence that the Azeri Government is not serious 
about CSCE and Russian peace projects.

  [Text] Armenian State Directorate for Underground Resources 
and the Russian Committee for Geology and Exploitation of 
Underground Resources signed an agreement in Moscow on 
cooperation in the geological study and exploitation of 
underground resources. 
  The principal aim of the agreement is to draw up and 
implement a mutually-advantageous policy for the geological 
study of the underground resources. 
  In accordance with one of the points in that agreement, a 
protocol was also signed in Moscow on the Armenian Republic's 
participation in the exploitation of oil and gas fields in 
Russia. The Armenian side is mostly interested in participating 
in the exploitation of one of the oil and gas fields in western 
Russia. It will make certain investments and participate in the 
work by establishing an Armenian-Russian joint venture with any 
Russian organization certified to exploit the underground 
resources. 
  In return, the Armenian side is ready to examine the issue 
of 
the participation of the Russian enterprises in the geological 
study and exploitation of the oil and gas fields in Armenia.

  [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- Yesterday President Aliyev 
met with Vladimir Kazimirov, a special Russia's representative 
for Nagorno Karabakh. 
  Kazimirov left Tehran for Baku on Saturday evening, where he 
has discussions in Iran Foreign Ministry for the settlement of 
Armenian-Azeri conflict. 
  During the meeting Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan states the 
continuation of mediatory activity with satisfaction. "But this 
work should not stop and ceasefire should be used for completion 
of negotiating process", noted President. 
  According to Aliyev, contacts of Jan Eliasson -- head of 
CSCE 
Minsk group, Kazimirov, Vladimir Shumeyko -- head of Russia's 
Council of Federation and Anatoliy Adamshin -- deputy of 
Russia's Foreign Ministry in Moscow are of great importance. 
"It is a good moment in negotiating process and it is necessary 
to join efforts of CSCE Minsk group, CIS and Russia to make this 
process more efficient", noted Aliyev. 
  Eliasson's and Kazimirov's joint appeal to the Presidents of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan was appreciated by Aliyev. "This appeal 
meets our interests, we think it was right and we accept it", 
noted Aliyev. According to him Azerbaijan will firmly support 
ceasefire. 
  "According to Eliasson, who was in Yerevan, Armenia also 
insists on active participation of CSCE Minsk group in the 
conflict's settlement and stands for ceasefire. But Armenian 
troops attacked towards Sadarak region (Nakhichevan Autonomous 
Republic) and in a few days attacked borders of Kazakh region on 
June 19-20. In result, six Azeri soldiers were killed and there 
were a lot of wounded", noted Aliyev. 
  "Such incidents are unavoidable and each time they should be 
localized in order not to impact the situation", said Kazimirov. 
He also noted that the incidents on the borders anxired [made 
anxious] mediators. "The joint appeal to the presidents of 
Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as to Robert Kocharyan [Karabakh 
leader] was caused by these incidents. We appealed to them in 
order not to sharpen the situation", told Russian diplomat. 
  According to Kazimirov, Russia supports consultations with 
Iran Foreign Ministry. "We will have consultations also with 
Turkey in near future" he noted. 
  Aliyev named these consultations "natural moment in 
negotiating process". According to him, two countries 
neighbouring with Armenia and Azerbaijan, can not be indifferent 
to the events in the region. 
  Kazimirov told Aliyev that his meeting with Eliasson, within 
the framework of the "nine" of Minsk group together with 
participation of representatives of warring parties will take 
place, in early July in Vienna. Then, meeting of CSCE 
Interparliamentry Assembly will take place on July 4 in Vienna 
and during the period from July 5 to July 8 a session of CSCE 
Minsk group for the conflict settlement will take place. 
  "It is very important to move towards the Big Political 
Contract during this period. If this time is used for 
propagandic war, that time will be wasted and will cost people a 
pretty penny", noted Kazimirov. According to Kazimirov, the 
attempts to contradict CSCE to Russia is also a waist of time. 
"But we don't see any contradictions in the settlement plans of 
CSCE and Russia, there some contradictions not in the essence, 
but in the details", said Kazimirov. He noted that Russia is 
ready to mutual cooperation with CSCE. 
  According to Aliyev, Azerbaijan's terms in the settlement 
process remain unchanged. "The withdrawal of Armenian troops 
from the captured territories and return of the refugees to 
their houses is the very important term. After that, 
restoration of communications and security of Armenians of 
Nagorno Karabakh, as well as discussion of Nagorno Karabakh's 
status will have some logical meaning", noted Aliyev. 
  Kazimirov had negotiations in the Turkish embassy in 
Azerbaijan late at night yesterday. The negotiations lasted 
more than three hours. On June 27 Kazimirov left Baku for 
Yerevan.

  [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- Over 15 Kurds-Yezidis were 
violently killed during the clashes on the ethnic base between 
the Kurd-yezids population of Garalar village of Araratskiy 
region in Armenia and group of armed Armenians, who came from 
Yerevan. TURAN was told by informed source that the clash took 
place in the middle of June, when some representatives of Kurd 
Working Party [PKK], functioning in the republic, were arrested 
by Armenian authorities. 
  This event sharpened the complicated social and political 
situation in Armenia. The Kurds again remember the violent 
murder of Said Ibon, famous pediatrist, Kurd by nationality, 
killed by Armenians in 1991 in his office. 
  According to information, Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenian 
president, ordered to deploy special forces and military 
hardware imto Garalar village and other regions where Kurd 
population live. The troops were ordered to open fire, if any 
attempts of counterraction on the part of local Kurd population 
take place.

  [Text] Baku (June 27) TURAN -- On June 23 the opposition 
leaders of Azerbaijan -- Nadzhaf Nadzhafov (PFA) [People's Front 
of Azerbaijan], Asim Mollazade (PFA) and Sabit Bagirov (Musavat) 
returned from the trip to the US, which has been lasting for ten 
days. They were invited by the National Democratic Institute. 
  The Deputy of Supreme Soviet, the member of the PFA 
Consultative Council, Nadzhaf Nadzhafov said that the trip was 
very fruitful. The members of the delegation met with the 
employees of the US State Department, White House, NATO's 
experts and scientists from Research Centres. 
  "We tried to know the US strategic interests in our region 
and Washington's assessment of geopolitical situation in 
Transcaucasia", said Nadzhaf Nadzhafov. He mentioned that each 
specialist has its own views and that's why assesses the events 
in the Caucasus differently. In this connection, it is 
difficult to speak about the US common policy concerning the 
Caucasus. American specialists directly said that they are 
interested in development of Azerbaijan's oil-fields, said 
Nadzhafov. He also added that the US lack objective information 
about Azerbaijan. "One has to take measures to provide the US 
with regular information about Azerbaijan", said Nadzhaf 
Nadzhafov.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova and others] 
  [Text] The preliminary results of the presidential 
elections in Ukraine revealed diametrically opposed tendencies 
in the east and west of the country, which can ultimately lead 
to a split, a high-ranking Russian expert specializing in 
Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Monday [27 June]. 
He noted, though, that he expressed the opinion of a political 
scientist rather than a diplomat. 
  What happened was easy to predict, he went on to say. The 
west voted for Leonid Kravchuk, who scored 90 percent of the 
votes in Lvov, for instance. The east, including Donbass, 
Zaporozhye and Crimea, voted for Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, 
who is leading with an impressive preponderance. 
  Obviously, the electors voted for the ideas expressed by the 
candidates, not for the candidates as such. Kravchuk symbolizes 
independence and gradual departure from Russia, while Kuchma -- 
independence and rapprochement with Russia, he said. 
  He also noted that before the Soviet Union's breakup, 
Ukraine 
had never existed as an independent state. The west of Ukraine 
was initially part of Austro-Hungary and then Hungary and 
Poland, while the east had always gravitated to Russia. "The 
conventional border ran along the Dnieper. Hence, the left-bank 
(eastern) and right-bank (western) Ukraine," said the Russian 
expert. The preliminary results of the elections show that the 
historical division was still strongly influencing the alignment 
of political forces in Ukraine, he said. 
  He said he did not want to make far-reaching conclusions. 
"One should not forget, however, that during the 1991 
referendum, 90 percent of the Ukrainian residents voted for 
independence. The situation has changed since then. This is 
the only thing one can say with confidence," he said.

  [Text] French scientists have offered their Ukrainian 
colleagues assistance in resolving the problem of disposing of 
radioactive waste from atomic electric power plants. France has 
enormous experience -- in that country, atomic electric power 
plants produce 70 percent of all the electricity being consumed. 
Accordingly, an efficient system of disposing of radioactive 
waste was created there. France's major company dealing with 
these problems has agreed on concrete cooperation with 
representatives of Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic Energy, 
Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, and the Institute of 
Geological Sciences during negotiations in Paris.

Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir 
Shishlin] 
  [Text] Aleksandr Lukashenko, the front runner of the first 
round of elections in Belarus, believes that his victory was 
tantamount to the vote of no confidence on the current Cabinet. 
He told a press conference in Minsk that this could be seen 
from the wide gap between the 45.1 percent he had scored and the 
17.4 percent of the votes scored by Prime Minister Kebich. 
  He announced, however, that he would not remove all of the 
current Cabinet members from their posts, if he won. According 
to unofficial sources, Lukashenko is planning to offer the post 
of prime minister to the current Economics Minister Sergey Ling. 
  Lukashenko's proxy, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission 
for Legislation Dmitriy Bulakhov, refused to comment on the 
rumors about ballot rigging (according to which Lukashenko 
scored 56 percent, not 45.1 percent of the votes, which would 
have meant his complete victory - Interfax). 
  He also said that it was senseless to cast doubts on the 
Central Electoral Commission's official reports, because he was 
confident in Lukashenko's victory during the second round. 
  According to Interfax sources, Lukashenko's and Kebich's 
teams are holding consultations with Zenon Poznyak, Stanislav 
Shushkevich, Aleksandr Dubko and Vassiliy Novikov, who lost the 
first round. 
  Viktor Ivashkevich, the proxy of leader of the People's 
Front, said that Poznyak would not to go to the polling station 
on the day of the second round. He also quoted Poznyak as 
saying that the people had voted against the old system, but 
failed to voice their support for the creation of a new one. He 
announced that the leaders of the Belarusian People's Front 
would meet on Saturday to decide which candidate to support 
during the second round and whether to support anyone at all. 
  Sushkevich refused to comment on the current political 
situation. Asked which candidate he would support, he said that 
none of the first round wwinners had any scientifically 
substantiated economic program. (Shortly, Shushkevich is 
planning to set out for a tour of European countries, where he 
will give a series of lectures at local universities - 
Interfax). 
  Vassily Novikov and Aleksandr Dubko have not yet decided 
whom 
to support during the second round. At the end of the week, the 
Central Committee of the Belarusian Communist Party is to hold a 
plenary meeting to determine the party's position on the 
elections. A spokesman for the Council of Collective Farms told 
Interfax that Aleksandr Dubko was abroad and that in his absence 
the agrarians could not decide whom to support during the second 
round.

TASS] 
  [Text] Minsk 27 June TASS -- According to Belarusian 
presidential candidate Aleksandr Lukashenko, "all the generals 
and all the leaders of state bodies of power will be removed 
within 24 hours" if he becomes president. 
  However, Lukashenko called rumors that he wanted to kick out 
the whole state apparatus if he is elected groundless. "85 per 
cent of government employees and law enforcement personnel -- 
the police, the KGB, the Interior Ministry, the procurator's 
office -- are respectable and honest people," he announced at a 
press conference in Minsk on Monday. 
  With the exception of the top military and civilian brass, 
Lukashenko and his team are "ready to work and cooperate" with 
government employees. That statement also concerns the 
republic's industrial managers, whose enterprises will be given 
up to January 1, 1995 to "function normally." If they are not 
capable of meeting that deadline, "the heads will be fired," 
Lukashenko explained. 
  The Belarusian candidate refused to exclude the possibility 
that he would invite one of the members of the current 
government to fill the prime minister's seat, if he is elected.

leaders, was set up as runoff presidential elections are a near 
certainty. 
  The party intends to hold urgent talk with Aleksandr 
Lukashenko who gained far more votes than his rivals in the 
first round of voting. 
  A party spokesman said that if their goals in carrying out 
economic reforms coincide, the party would support Lukashenko in 
the runoff elections which are expected to be held in the first 
half of July.

<F P=106> [BELINFORM report: "Why Has It Happened This Way, and What </F>
Can Be Next?] 
  [Text] Apparently, for many people, the results of 
the first round of presidential elections were completely 
unexpected. Why has it happened this way? What will be next? 
BELINFORM has addressed these questions to the following 
people: 
  Anatoliy Maysenya, director of the "East-West" Strategic 
Initiatives Center: 
  "As a matter of fact, the `NOVAK' laboratory for axonometric 
research, which had made forecasts concerning the election 
course at our request, had predicted Alyaksandr Lukashenka's 
victory. Still, we did not expect such an overwhelming lead 
over the prime minister. I believe that this happened because 
Kebich and the current political elite were unable to develop a 
comprehensive platform. Due to that, during the campaign the 
Cabinet of Ministers chairman's team placed emphasis not on 
convincing the people, but on forceful methods. This 
boomeranged. All attempts to discredit Lukashenka brought to 
him people who had been undecided until the last moment. Thus, 
just as in all post-socialist countries, the election results in 
Belarus were a specific form of the people's protest against the 
drastic deterioration of living standards." 
  Alyaksandr Potupa, chief of the Future Research Center: 
  "According to my forecasts, which are known to television 
viewers and readers of many newspapers, Prime Minister 
Vyacheslaw Kebich should become president. I am still convinced 
that I am correct. 
  "No one expected such an anomalous outcome. Nevertheless, it 
must be taken into account that this was only the first round. 
Moreover, such results are very beneficial for our people. They 
will serve as a stimulus for `a second brain convolution' to 
appear. I believe that our team has every chance for victory in 
the second round." 
  Yevgeniy Babosov, director of the Belarusian Academy of 
Sciences Sociology Institute: 
  "I link such a large margin between Alyaksandr Lukashenka 
and 
Vyacheslaw Kebich to the poor organization of the prime 
minister's last appearances on Belarusian television. I had the 
impression that Vyacheslaw Frantsevich was afraid of direct 
contacts with his opponents, and that he dodged urgent issues. 
However, I know that he can hold out pretty well even during an 
unbiased conversation. Therefore, this insignificant slander 
against Lukashenka, made public on the eve of the election, had 
a completely reciprocal effect, and increased the number of 
votes cast for the latter. 
  "I think that there are three options for the second round. 
Either, having united, candidates who lost in the election will 
appeal to vote neither for Lukashenka nor Kebich, and in this 
way they will `blackball' both of them; or the team, which lost 
in the first round, will mobilize its ranks and analyze 
mistakes, and as a result, will avenge itself; and the third 
option is a landslide victory for Lukashenka." 
  National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich, member of 
Stanislaw Shushkevich's team: 
  "Such a huge margin between first and second places is 
really 
a big surprise. 
  "Based on the preliminary results of the first round of 
voting, one can also make forecasts for the final return." 
  Asked whether his statement, made in an interview published 
in NARODNAYA GAZETA, that he is ready to work with any president 
still remains in force, Stanislaw Antonavich replied: "The 
statement has been made, and I do not renounce my words. I am 
ready to cooperate even with Lukashenka, but such cooperation 
should be based on principles. In general, I believe that the 
Belarusian leadership needs to be reshuffled."

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski </F>
by Nikolay Mirgorodskiy; place and date not given: "About 
Honor, Courage, and Glory"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mirgorodskiy] You mentioned 
earlier that the Belarusian Military District [BVO] has tested 
new weapons and hardware. Does this mean that currently you do 
not test new military equipment? In general, where do you buy 
weapons, technology, uniforms, fuel, spare parts, and foodstuffs? 
  [Kazlowski] I like your question. You should have asked the 
same question to some of our deputies who blame all sins on our 
Army. Yes, earlier the Armed Forces were centrally supplied. 
The BVO was considered the best in the USSR. Moscow supplied 
us with everything. Currently, the situation has changed. The 
rigid system of centralized supply does not work. We have to 
seek bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and 
other states to maintain the Army's combat readiness. 
  Again, we experience difficulties with funds. I wish that 
the state would provide us with sufficient resources to fulfill 
our needs. However, alas! We have to trade, even though we are 
severely criticized for conducting such activities. Sometimes, 
this criticism is justified. You must agree with me that trade 
is not a top priority activity in the Army. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] The banner of the unit is sacred to all 
servicemen. Its loss is considered a great shame. What about 
our old banners? Will you abandon them or exchange them for 
"white-red- white" banners? 
  [Kazlowski] We have filed a petition with the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet to keep the old combat banners, medals, and 
unit names. This is our history, our memories. There has still 
been no final decision on this issue. The proposal regarding 
the national banner of the Belarusian Armed Forces with its 
accompanying attributes is under consideration. In our opinion, 
two banners -- old and new -- should be used side-by-side in the 
ranks. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Could we imagine an enemy attacking our 
state? 
Will the Belarusian Army be able to protect us? 
  [Kazlowski] Our troops are in a state of combat readiness. 
This is unquestionable. The point is in something else. Can 
the Belarusian Army alone repulse a potential enemy? Everything 
depends on the scope of the conflict. The Army will fight, 
however, it is better to fight alongside some other friendly 
states. At least, this is more reliable. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] How much money will the Defense Ministry 
receive this year? 
  [Kazlowski] Some 4 percent of the overall state budget. This 
is only enough to keep the Army afloat. By the way, the Russian 
Armed Forces receive 20 percent of the state budget. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] According to you, we are short of military 
hardware. However, judging by recently published complimentary 
articles, we are successfully dismantling tanks, planes, and 
missiles. This is not logical... 
  [Kazlowski] This is logical if common sense is at all 
characteristic of our society. We are implementing the 
international agreements. However, we have the right to use 
some of the equipment -- subject to dismantlement -- as 
exhibits. This is our sore point. Still, there is practically 
no one who wants to buy vehicles which have been converted to 
civilian use. In addition, we can sell only a specified number 
of tanks while the remaining tanks must be dismantled. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] How do you use the metal? 
  [Kazlowski] It is further smelted in Zhlobin.... 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Pavel Pavlovich, how do Belarusian servicemen 
react to the use of the Belarusian language, which is being 
currently introduced in the Army? It would be interesting to 
hear how military orders sound in Belarusian. 
  [Kazlowski] The reactions of privates and officers to this 
issue are different. However, the people understand the 
importance of this novelty and do not express added emotions. 
The language is being taught and we do not want to accelerate 
this process. Everything should be done thoroughly. However, 
graduates of our military colleges must speak fluent Belarusian. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] We spoke about the shortage of fuel and 
lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition. What about military 
training? Have you cut down on this program? 
  [Kazlowski] This is a separate question in itself. Military 
training is being fulfilled according to a program. We use 
various types of training equipment, including equipment 
produced at Belarusian factories. We only try to restrict the 
redeployment of troops. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] Belarus does not train officers in all 
disciplines. Where does the Defense Ministry recruit experts? 
  [Kazlowski] We are short some 1,500 officers. A national 
Academy is being established and some colleges are being 
respecialized. In addition, we provide for the training of 
experts abroad. One month of training abroad costs us between 
$300 and $500. Is this expensive? Of course. We exchange 
students with some states, however, so this eases the problem. 
Currently, the cadets who entered our military colleges in the 
time of the USSR are completing their education. Very few of 
them, however, are eager to perform their service in Belarus 
because the monetary allowance of an officer in Russia is twice 
as high as that in Belarus. By the way, the allowance of a 
Belarusian private is half the current minimum wage. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] What is the price of a cartridge for a 
Kalashnikov assault rifle? 
  [Kazlowski] The cost of one artillery round -- depending on 
the type of shell -- is between $100 and $600. A cartridge for 
a Kalashnikov assault rifle costs $0.25. So, you can calculate 
and compare. 
  [Mirgorodskiy] We cannot raise all issues in one interview. 
Still, we are worried about the hazing of conscripts in our 
Army. It would seem that only Belarusian youth are in active 
service but this shameful phenomenon does not disappear. 
  [Kazlowski] Yes, to my regret. Groups representing various 
regions -- "Vitebsk," "Grodno," "Minsk," "Gomel," and others -- 
have been established. Yes, we have conflicts. Please, 
understand me: The Army is not separated from the state and all 
our conflicts are reflected in the Army. We are fighting 
against legal violations in the Army. However, can the Army 
reeducate a person, can it break him of his harmful habits? It 
is no secret that up to 30 percent of our conscripts have a 
criminal record. They are the ones who initiate the hazing of 
conscripts. I would like to stress that whatever we used to say 
about our former political instructors in the Army, their work 
produced definite results. It happens that commanders cannot 
fulfill the functions of instructors. They cannot become 
fathers to privates.... 
  [Mirgorodskiy] The last question is not very pleasant. At 
the coordinating meeting of leaders of law enforcement agencies 
dealing with the fight against crime and corruption, the Defense 
Ministry faced criticism from the prime minister. For example, 
you were criticized for not participating in the strengthening 
of public order. What can you say about this? 
  [Kazlowski] Currently, some 170 servicemen are patrolling 
the 
streets of Minsk. They have taken some 800 people into custody. 
I would like to know what became of these people later.... In 
addition, the attitude of some militiamen to us is different. 
It is up to experts to define how many servicemen are required 
to patrol the streets. Minsk may require more, while Mogilev or 
Bobruysk -- fewer.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 24/6/1994 -- The cooperation 
agreement between the Moldovan National Security Ministry and 
the Russian Counterintelligence Service was signed today in 
Chisinau, states the National Security Ministry press service. 
Vasile Calmoi, National Security Minister, mentioned that the 
agreement is welcome in times when "the cooperation of special 
services has become necessary for combating criminal activities 
that threaten state and individual security." The 
representatives of the Russian Counterintelligence stated that 
the signing of the agreement proves once more that Russian 
special services will never carry out subversive operations 
against Moldova. They said that the agreement itself stipulates 
the interdiction of using against each other the means and 
torches of the security organs as "Russia is firm in its stance, 
which recognizes Moldova's independence and integrity." They 
also said that they support a peaceful settlement of the 
Dniester conflict. They assured that "the Russian 
Counter-intelligence Service will offer its support only within 
the legal framework." Previously, Moldovan National Security 
signed similar agreements with the Ukrainian Security Service 
and the Russian Foreign Information Service, states the 
communique.

  [Text] Tiraspol, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- Informed sources 
from the 14th Army told BASA that a group of 30 officers of the 
Dniester Security Ministry had left for Crimea. The group is 
assigned to take part in preparing the soldiers of the Crimean 
Interior Ministry to carry out certain military operations. 
Sources from the Dniester security told BASA that such 
information is totally unfounded. The same sources stated that 
the spreading of such rumors is part of the campaign to 
discredit Tiraspol officials. Earlier, it was said that a group 
of eight officers of the "Delfin" detachment and "Dniestr" 
battalion of the Dniester Interior Ministry were sent in 1993 to 
Abkhazia to organize diversions in the rear of the Georgian 
Army. Sources from the 14th Army said that the Abkhazian defense 
minister sent a letter to the Tiraspol Interior Ministry 
recommending promotion of the officers of the "Dniester" 
battalion who took part in military operations in Abkhazia.

  [Text] Moscow BASAPRESS, 24/6/1994 -- The president of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic, Igor Smirnov, held a press 
conference at the headquarters of the Moscow newspaper 
SOVYETSKAYA ROSSIYA (SOVIET RUSSIA.) The Tiraspol leader 
declared that the latest negotiations with the Chisinau 
authorities proved that the political solution of the conflict 
is still indefinite; economic relations with Moldova first need 
to be restored. Smirnov stated that the 14th Russian Army is 
not willing to contribute to the solution of the conflict, 
because the soldiers benefit from high incomes for their service 
in a "conflict zone." According to the Dniester leader, 
Tiraspol presently has claims to the assets of the military 
units which are to be evacuated from the Eastern regions; it 
also intends to inherit the rest of the 14th Army property after 
the latter leaves the region for good. "[14th Army Commander 
General Aleksandr] Lebed inherited the military equipment and 
ammunitions of the entire south-western sector of the Soviet 
Army. We have been a part of the USSR; we paid taxes and now 
have full rights to possess the property of the troops on our 
territory," said Smirnov. Commenting on the latent conflict 
between the Tiraspol authorities and the commander of the 14th 
Army, Smirnov stated that "the necessity to search for corrupt 
persons is a feature of Lebed's character" and, eventually, it 
will be of great use if he returns to Russia. "I do not think I 
should argue with or deny Lebed's declarations," [accusing the 
Dniester leaders of corruption] mentioned the Tiraspol leader, 
reminding that during the recent celebrations on 19 June 
dedicated to the second anniversary of the tragic events in 
Bender, Commander Lebed was booed by the audience.

  [Text] At a news conference held in Moscow Igor Smirnov, 
president of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldavian [Moldovan] 
Republic [DMR], declared that "individuals in the 14th Army are 
not interested in resolving the conflict" between Moldavia 
[Moldova] and the DMR. He based his opinion on the argument 
that the wages of a 14th Army officer stand at 300,000 Russian 
rubles, i.e. 1.5 million former Soviet rubles, which are the 
basic monetary unit in the DMR. Therefore, officers would not 
like to leave the Dniester region.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 28 June TASS -- The 14th Russian 
Army could be a guarantor against an outside aggression against 
either the Dniester Republic or Moldavia as a whole, Dniester 
parliament chief Grigoriy Marakutsa told ITAR-TASS. 
  Marakutsa favours the conclusion of an appropriate agreement 
with Russia that would specify the status of her troops in the 
region. "This may be a military base of Russia or of a 
peacekeeping force of the CIS," said the leader of parliament of 
the republic unrecognised by Moldavia. 
  A Russian Army came to the region in the days of Empress 
Catherine the Second, and ever since has been the guarantor of 
peace and stability, Marakutsa said. An overwhelming majority 
of the population of left-bank Moldavia agree with this. They 
know quite well who "dampened hot-heads and stopped bloodshed in 
the Dniester area in the summer of 1992," he said. 
  "The 14th Army is not an expeditionary corps temporarily 
deployed on foreign territory," Marakutsa emphasised. "The Army 
officers are rooted in this land. Their houses, families and 
relatives are here." His opinion is that those who press for 
the earliest withdrawal of the Army from the Dniester area know 
well that one can take away only its combat banner and a smaller 
part of hardware but that people would not go. 
  Speaking about the role of Russia in a settlement of the 
Dniester problem, Marakutsa pointed out that hardly any other 
state could play a more positive role than Russia. "Not every 
country would agree to expose its soldiers to danger to help a 
stranger in misfortune. The role of Russia in this respect is 
great and it will grow stronger," the Dniester parliament 
speaker stressed.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 23/06/1994 -- The draft 
program on governmental activity, presented today to the 
parliament, proves that the government promptly determined its 
objectives and strategic directions in its activity, stated 
Mircea Snegur in his speech to the parliament. He mentioned 
that the conditions for accomplishing the program is 
unfavorable, but yet conditions are more favorable than in 
previous years a lot will depend on the fruitful interaction 
between the parliament and executive power. In his opinion, "it 
is worth noting the correct choice of the main reform objectives 
and their correspondence with current potential resources. The 
radical revision of state property to be privatized will take 
place in the coming months with the launching of mass 
privatization through efficient economic mechanisms and means. 
However, they should also be socially fair: They should 
comprehensible and accessible for all citizens." Snegur said 
that "the draft program is oriented toward the consolidation of 
Moldova's statehood, legitimacy and political and economic 
sovereignty assurance of a leap in the transition to the new 
economic relations alongside the use of state regulations that 
do not contravene the concept of market economy; restoration of 
Moldova's territorial-economic integrity; coordination of 
actions concerning social protection and spiritual development, 
assurance of human rights and individual liberties promotion of 
a constructive foreign policy, including economic relations with 
all countries and international organizations." Referring to 
the budget, fiscal and crediting policy, Snegur said that state 
means should be used to "provide Moldova with food products and 
energy resources and to preserve the current social and 
production infrastructures." "The state will be the majority 
holder of assets and through governmental and parliamentary 
actions most of the work of transforming state enterprises into 
joint-stock companies will be concluded in 1994-95." He also 
said that "the state will keep the controlling portion of shares 
in the branches of strategic importance." In his opinion, 
"overcoming the crisis will require firmness and political will, 
as reform has not progressed as it should have: the juridical 
organizational forms, methods and mechanisms of implementation 
were lacking." Snegur also disapproved of "the opinions of 
using exceptional and emergency economic measures even in the 
difficult situation that we face." He said that "the government 
can fulfill its responsibility by gaining people's confidence 
through initiatives and a decisive yet flexible policy capable 
of quickly changing the situation."

  [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- The Social 
Democratic Party of Moldova [PSDM] today held a press 
conference. It made public its attitude toward the 
socio-economic situation in Moldova in the 100 days since the 27 
February elections. "The collapse of the standard of living is 
taking place along with a more insolent theft of state property. 
The blockage of mass privatization leads to decreasing prices 
for patrimonial vouchers: this removes the last chance open to 
the Moldovan citizens to escape hunger and poverty," states the 
PSDM declaration made public during the press conference. Oazu 
Nantoi, PSDM chairman, stated that due to the election results a 
single party is at power this party is responsible for the 
worsening socio-political situation in Moldova. In his opinion, 
the stability of the national currency "is due not only to the 
international credits or policy pursued by the National Bank, 
but to the Moldovan population's limitless patience." "The 
governing party is hurrying to ensure a political comfort 
similar to that of the communist party during the stagnation 
period. We are witnesses of a cleansing of those who have not 
hastened to show their loyalty to the governing party," said 
Nantoi. He also pointed out that freedom of expression is 
smothered in Moldova and censorship is used in state media. He 
alleged that the Government "has no clear strategy on how to 
settle the problems of Eastern and Southern Moldova or 
consolidating Moldova's statehood." Nantoi stated that another 
step toward Moldova's disintegration has been enacted by 
creating a symbolic federation within which the central 
administration cannot establish sovereignty on its territory. 
He said that the officials' exaggerated dependence on the 
relations between Moldova and Russia and "Chisinau's political 
inefficiency" stimulate Russia's demands for concessions. 
Nantoi pointed out that in the recent Tiraspol-Chisinau 
negotiations, the opinions of the Moldovan citizens living in 
Dniester were not heard. Commenting on the president's joining 
of the PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova], Nantoi said 
Snegur thus "assumes responsibility for the policy of the 
governing party."

  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 28 June TASS -- The Dniester 
Republic favours the development of close economic cooperation 
with Russia, the Republic's parliament chief Grigoriy Marakutsa 
told ITAR-TASS. 
  At the same time he is of the opinion that the relations 
with 
Russia, with which markets of commodities, raw materials and 
technology are linked, are being restrained by the Dniester 
area's uncertain status. For example, Marakutsa said, "we agree 
to independently repay debts to Russia for gas but the Russian 
Gazprom signed an appropriate agreement only with the Moldavian 
[Moldovan] Government." 
  In connection with the fact that the Dniester Republic, 
which 
has not been recognised by Moldavia, cannot pay with its own 
products and money for gas supplied by Russia, Marakutsa 
suggests taking the road followed by Baltic states, Ukraine and 
Byelorussia [Belarus]. His opinion is that one can pay for the 
supplied raw materials and energy resources by property, the 
establishment of joint ventures and apply other economic forms 
of cooperation.

Moldovan vice-minister of foreign affairs. This agreement was 
signed in Tiraspol ten days ago and stipulates the creation of 
joint-ventures, raw-materials supplies, creation of 
corresponding accounts between the State Bank of Dniester and 
the Regional Bank of Novocherkask, free movement of transport on 
the territories of both parties. Buruian stressed that, despite 
the fact that the document's text is based on the notion of a 
"Moldovan Dniester Republic," the Moldovan Department of Foreign 
Relations will not protest to the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, because it does not consider that the economic 
relations between regions are managed by the Moscow Diplomatic 
Department. Despite all, Buruian doubted the legality of the 
relations between the official Russian banks and the Tiraspol 
bank, unauthorized by Chisinau. Commenting on the agreement's 
article on joint criminal persecution, Buruian stressed that 
this point also violates Moldovan and Russian laws. "Besides, 
taking into consideration recent sad events, this point of the 
agreement could stimulate Russian military formations to enter 
Dniester," declared Alexandru Buruian. Sources from the 
Moldovan Department of Foreign Economic Relations stated to BASA 
that Tiraspol representatives did not consult experts from 
Chisinau before signing the agreement with Novocherkask.

  [Text] Due to the nonpayment of a large debt for natural 
gas consumption and delivery, the supply of natural gas to the 
republic was reduced by 60 percent as of 27 June 1994. 
  Instead of receiving 7.5m cubic meters of gas a day, the 
republic will now be receiving 3.0m cubic meters. The Sakgazi 
Department will distribute this limited supply among vital 
installations in the republic, including Tbilisi power station, 
which will be receiving 1.0m cubic meters of gas a day, instead 
of the required 3.0m cubic meters. 
  All supplies of natural gas to eastern and western Georgian 
regions and to the Kartli and Kvemo Kartli zones will be stopped 
as of today. 
  As soon as the situation improves the Sakgazi Department 
will 
take measures to resume the normal supply of gas.

  [Text] Kiev -- On 27 June UNIAN learned preliminary data 
about the voting in various oblasts for candidates in the 
presidential election. This data was received from oblast 
electoral commissions for the presidential election and from 
oblast councils of people's deputies. UNIAN also received 
preliminary data from the Central Electoral Commission for the 
election of a president of Ukraine. In most cases the data does 
not include several rayons in each oblast. 
  Leonid Kravchuk received more votes than the other 
candidates 
for president in the following oblasts: Vinnitsa, Volyn, 
Zhitomir, Ivano-Frankovsk, Rovno, Kiev, Kirovograd, Lvov, Sumy, 
Ternopol, Khmelnitskiy, Cherkassy, Chernovtsy, and 
Transcarpathia Oblasts and the city of Kiev. 
  Leonid Kuchma received more votes than the other candidates 
in the following oblasts: Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, 
Lugansk, Nikolayev, Odessa, Chernigov oblasts, the Republic of 
Crimea, and the city of Sevastopol. 
  Information from Kharkov Oblast is being finalized. UNIAN 
has learned from reliable sources that the picture there is 
ambiguous; in some rayons Oleksandr Moroz is well in the lead, 
but in some rayons either Leonid Kravchuk or Leonid Kuchma is 
slightly in the lead. In the town of Izyum, Volodymyr Lanovyy 
received 23 percent. 
  Information on Kherson and Poltava Oblasts is being 
finalized.

  Earlier today, reliable sources told ITAR-TASS on Monday [27 
June] that Kravchuk has taken the lead in 15 out of 24 Ukrainian 
regions in the nation's second presidential elections. 
  He was supported by the residents of the western, central 
and 
partially eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. 
  Kuchma has gained advantage over Kravchuk in the Crimea, the 
Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Odessa, Kharkov 
and Chernigov regions. 
  Since the Central Electoral Commission has not announced the 
preliminary results of voting yet, journalists have to base 
their reports on information provided by regional electoral 
commissions and other sources.

  [Text] Kiev, 28 June (AFP) -- Former Ukrainian premier 
Leonid Kuchma, challenging President Leonid Kravchuk in 
presidential elections here, will contest the validity of the 
first-round election result with an allegation of vote-rigging, 
a Kuchma aide said Tuesday [28 June]. 
  Pyotr Lemek accused several local electoral committees of 
falsifying votes to give Kravchuk an edge over Kuchma. A press 
conference of the central electoral committee scheduled for 
1100. (0800 GMT) Tuesday was delayed for several hours. 
  "Kuchma garnered 34 percent of the votes and Kravchuk 36 
percent, and the difference is not eight percentage points as 
(Kravchuk) aides maintain," he said.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 121 (611); </F>
compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by 
Vladimir Shishlin] 
  [Text] According to preliminary reports from district 
electoral commissions, the current head of state Leonid Kravchuk 
and the former prime-minister Leonid Kuchma hold the lead among 
presidential candidates. 
  Kravchuk is more popular in West Ukraine. In Ternopol 82 pct 
[percent] of votes were cast for him, in Rovno 70. 
  Kuchma was supported by the majority in the East and in 
Crimea. A preliminary report of the Central Electoral Commission 
says 82.6 pct of the voters that came to polling stations in 
Crimea cast their ballots for Kuchma and only 7.4 for Kravchuk. 
  Vote-counting continues, however, observers feel that 
Kravchuk and Kuchma are the most likely candidates to continue 
the presidential race. 
  The overall turnout was 68 pct of the electorate. 
  After voting on Sunday [26 June] Kravchuk answered questions 
from the press at a polling station in Kiev. He declared that 
the parliament cannot legally restrict the powers of the 
president. According to him, "The president is elected as the 
head of state and the head of the executive branch of power." IF 
Note: At the moment the Ukrainian parliament is discussing 
amendments to the law on presidency under which the president 
would only have the powers of the head of state. 
  Kravchuk believes that the powers of the president can be 
altered only through a referendum declared by parliament. "But 
if such a referendum is announced, the powers of the parliament 
might end with it," he stressed. If the parliament tries to 
restrict presidential powers without a referendum, confrontation 
is going to begin, the president thinks. This should be 
realized by both sides. 
  Kravchuk spoke of the priority of relations with Russia for 
his country. Whoever is elected president must understand that, 
he said. Kravchuk said he continues to insist on Ukraine's 
membership in the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. He said he 
submitted an appropriate suggestion to parliament. 
  Meanwhile, Kuchma intends to refrain from submitting the 
matter to parliament in the event of being elected. "Ukraine has 
not received a cent in Western aid for scrapping nuclear 
weapons," he explained his stance to the press on Sunday in Kiev. 
  "If the parliament restricts presidential powers and I am 
elected, either of the two will have to step down," Kuchma said 
adding that no one runs for presidency in order to resign. 
  Speaking of his economic policy Kuchma said he favored a 
civilized market controlled by the state. As for foreign policy 
he said: "We have many tasks inside the CIS." According to 
him, Ukraine should contact countries that want to have 
relations with it. 
  Kuchma spoke for revising the Ukrainian tax policy and 
fixing 
the exchange rate of the karbovanets with regard to key foreign 
currencies. 
  He said he does not see any tension in Crimea. In his 
opinion there are certain circles that find tension in Crimea 
advantageous. In his opinion the problem of the Black Sea Fleet 
was resolved by the present cabinet a long time ago.

  [Text] Kiev, 27 Jun -- "The conclusions by some political 
analysts and journalists that the `left-wing' forces were 
victorious is an exaggeration," Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil 
stated at a news conference. "In the presidential elections the 
communists suffered a crushing defeat. According to preliminary 
results, Oleksandr Moroz received up to 10 percent of the vote," 
Vyacheslav Chornovil stressed at the news conference. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil noted the vigorous activity of voters 
in 
western regions. In his words, less activity was observed in 
eastern and south-eastern oblasts. 
  In his assessment of the elections of local council 
chairmen, 
V. Chornovil, in particular, said: "In a whole number of oblasts 
voters favored representatives of Rukh and only in Chernigov, 
Dnepropetrovsk, and in several other oblasts will the posts of 
oblast council leaders be taken up by communists and 
representatives of `left-wing' forces. However, in the majority 
of oblasts the leaders of oblast councils are centrist-oriented." 
  The Rukh leader said that in Kiev Volodymyr Chernyak got 
through to the second round and was slightly behind the present 
town council leader, Leonid Kosakivskyy. Volodymyr Chernyak, 
who was present at the news conference, noted in particular that 
"the passivity of Kiev residents could have been due to their 
indifference to the city's fate. I testify that the elections 
of 1994 are less democratic than the elections of 1989-90."

  [Text] The Ukrainian Central Election Commission tonight 
announced a postponement of the news conference on the 
preliminary results of the presidential elections earlier 
scheduled for 1100 on 28 June. 
  The commission told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the large volume 
of 
information to be processed and the slow pace of its 
transmission made the summing up of results in such a short 
period of time impossible. 
  The commission said that general information on the results 
of the Ukrainian presidential elections divulged by the media 
had nothing to do with the official sources.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ben: "The Criminal World Has Declared </F>
War on Us"] 
  [Text] The criminal world has declared war on us. This is 
how participants in the coordination conference on security that 
was held the day before yesterday [22 June] by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk assessed the present crime-breeding 
situation in our state. 
  Our peace and harmony are in danger. Ukraine's citizens have 
found themselves defenseless before the onslaught of crime. Not 
just so-called rank-and-file citizens, but also those who have 
both money and power. The murder attempt on people's deputy V. 
Bortnyk and very recent cases of murdering Ukrainian businessmen 
confirm this. According to the statistics of Ukraine's Ministry 
of Internal Affairs, the number of contract murders involving 
firearms has tripled. As asserted by deputy minister of 
internal affairs Yuriy Kravchenko, a black market of weapons has 
emerged in our country; a pistol can be procured for just $500, 
a submachinegun for $3,000, and a carbine -- for between $1,500 
and $2,000. 
  It looks like the criminal world is openly mocking us. A few 
days ago, the automobile of justice minister Vasyl Onopenko was 
stolen. Onopenko is now clutching at his head because the 
juridical nonsense according to which car thieves are still 
divided into those who actually steal the car and those who 
simply drive it away has not yet been abolished. The punishment 
for driving away an automobile is like patting the criminal on 
the back. 
  The black market and black humor: Had the criminals stolen 
that automobile earlier, the minister would have started 
pondering the nonsense earlier. 
  Leaders of power departments -- Ukraine's Security Service, 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator General's 
Office are again demanding that the struggle against crime be 
enhanced by legislation, in particular, preventive detention of 
suspects for 30 days, mandatory capital punishment for the 
murder of officers of law-enforcement bodies, state officials, 
and people's deputies, the creation of strong legal executive 
structures, and so on. The minister of justice also proposes 
that order be established in issuing quotas and licenses, that 
the right to register entrepreneurs be transferred from local 
bodies to his own department, and that people's and oblast 
judges be nominated by presidential edicts. At the same time, 
head of the Security Service Yevhen Marchuk also sees salvation 
from the revelry of crime in creating strong presidential power 
with an experienced president at the head and in adopting 
primarily those legislative acts that are aimed at protecting 
the individual, and believes that a situation may take shape 
when we will be compelled to resort, as he put it, to some 
elements of an emergency situation which, in his opinion, the 
people will support. 
  We are not talking about an emergency situation, stressed 
Leonid Kravchuk, but about extraordinary measures for combating 
crime. Having just issued several edicts -- on the return of 
hard currency from abroad and on the struggle against 
speculation -- he is ready to come out, as soon as possible, 
with a corresponding legislative initiative before the 
parliament. The president is also convinced that the criminal 
world has declared war on us and that we, in turn, should also 
get organized and declare war on crime.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- On 27 June, at around 
1030 GMT, supporters of Yuriy Meshkov who regularly gather near 
the Crimean Supreme Council offended and used physical force 
against certain Supreme Council deputies because they were 
annoyed at the actions of the Crimean parliament which had cast 
doubt on the competence of certain edicts issued by the Crimean 
president. 
  At a presidium meeting of the Crimean Supreme Council at 
1130 
GMT, presidium member Serhiy Nikulin demanded that Interior 
Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov be called out to establish order; 
however, Supreme Council Chairman Serhiy Tsekov went out himself 
to see those who had gathered near the entrance to the premises 
to assess the situation. 
  At the same time Yuriy Meshkov made a speech to his 
supporters in which he noted: "Thanks to your support I was able 
to announce the possibility of reforms in Crimea. The richest 
people in the world have already promised to give material help 
in the near future in an amount that I am even afraid to say." 
Yuriy Meshkov also said that the results of his trip to 
Switzerland were very hopeful. Several European and Asian 
countries, in particular Hungary, Korea, and especially Iran 
have declared their intention to establish friendly relations 
with Crimea. 
  After a stormy assessment of the situation, Serhiy Tsekov 
also left the rally which had decided that on 28 June the 
Supreme Council deputies would meet representatives of the 
community that support President Yuriy Meshkov of Crimea.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Crimean Deputy Prime Minister </F>
Yevgeniy Saburov and presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The fewer the reforms in Ukraine, the more 
separatist the sentiment in the Crimea; this is what Crimean 
Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov said on 23 June at a 
meeting with presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy. Yevgeniy 
Saburov outlined the current socioeconomic situation on the 
peninsula: plants sitting idle, most of the workers being paid 
meager wages, the average salary reaching no more than 200,000 
karbovantsi. There are no efficient leverages for managing and 
regulating the economy -- the tax and statistics services did 
not receive financial aid from official Kiev; neither did the 
Republic's economy in general. The last hope is placed on the 
creation of a favorable climate for investments in the Crimea 
and firm guarantees for entrepreneurship in the sphere of 
financial and credit policies. "The fewer the reforms there are 
in Ukraine, the more separatist the sentiments there are in the 
Crimea," the deputy prime minister summed up. 
  Saburov sees no obstacles for developing political relations 
with the official Kiev, and would like to see constructive and 
balanced approaches to resolving problems. "We have no fear of 
any possible confrontation," he declared. "There is nothing to 
fear when the people are on the brink of utmost destitution and 
half-starved subsistence." 
  Asked by our correspondent about his attitude toward 
Kravchuk's statement that the foundation for the market economy 
has already been laid in Ukraine, Saburov snapped: "Maybe. But 
where? Show me the place. In the basement? Those who did not 
go down there will never learn about it." As for the statement 
by Ukrainian legislative speaker Oleksandr Moroz that if elected 
president, he would do his best to protect people from 
misimplemented market reforms, Saburov commented as follows: 
"That statement does not explain whom he had in mind. To 
protect against whom? Against the state policies that have 
nothing to do with market reforms or against state regulation of 
the market economy? The latter is promised in his election 
platform." Whatever the case, Saburov said, we are ready for 
cooperation. The fact that in spite of his busy schedule, 
Saburov devoted almost an hour and a half to talks with 
presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy shows that the head of 
the Crimean Government has made his choice.

<F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha from Simferopol under the "Crimea" </F>
rubric: "Parliamentarians Want To Deal With Privatization on 
Their Own. They Have Attempted To Strip Yuriy Meshkov of Some 
Presidential Powers"] 
  [Text] Contradictions between Crimea's president and 
parliament are taking on the form of a direct standoff. Upon 
his return from Switzerland last week, Yuriy Meshkov caught the 
deputies in yet another attempt to curb his presidential powers: 
the Supreme Soviet tried to pass the so-called "Law on 
Enforcing the Crimean Constitution." The session did not 
specify which Constitution was at issue -- the new or the old 
one, which sparked a conflict with Kiev, but this seemed to be 
of no importance. The deputies wanted to pass a provision 
entitling them to rescind and to suspend presidential edicts, to 
stop the activity of local authorities, and even to appoint 
chiefs of local soviets, something that belongs to the Crimean 
president's few prerogatives. 
  It is hard to say what stopped the lawmakers. Probably, with 
Mr. Meshkov back in town, conscience awoke in some of his "bloc 
friends" and the bill has not been passed so far. But... 
  Observers note that all legislative trip-ups stem from the 
commonplace struggle for a place at the trough, which has 
continued at the parliament without letup since its election. 
The Crimea Supreme Soviet simply does not care about settling 
the conflict with Kiev. Also on 23 June, the presidential edict 
subordinating the Crimean State Property Fund to the Saburov 
government and the edict "on the privatization of Crimean 
state-owned enterprises" were rescinded. All this means just 
one thing: the parliament is intent on fully swilling 
everything out of the hypothetical "trough" and on dealing with 
privatization on its own. If the deputies, who acknowledged at 
the latest session their complete economic and legal ignorance, 
manage to succeed, Crimea will simply have no government at all, 
and the factions will start bickering over the distribution of 
property.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Mezhak, deputy chairman of the </F>
Supreme Council of Crimea, by A. Sergeyev; place and date not 
given: "Parliament's Potential Will Be Realized"] 
  [Text] [Sergeyev] Viktor Petrovich, you were a member of 
the previous Supreme Council and have now become deputy 
chairman. Is it possible maybe six weeks since the start of 
business to evaluate the degree of readiness for work of the 
present deputies? 
  [Mezhak] It is quite high, in my view. It can be seen even 
now that it is not a "pocket" parliament, as some critics had 
predicted it would be. A polarity of views on many political 
issues may be traced distinctly. On the other hand, the deputies 
find a common language perfectly well when socioeconomic 
problems are tackled and are exacting toward the government and 
see as its main role Crimea's extrication from the crisis and an 
enhancement of the living standard of each Crimean. 
  [Sergeyev] Your last observation does not coincide very well 
with the topic of conversation during the Presidium sitting, 
when the program of targeted subsidies was rejected. 
  [Mezhak] Such a view (it is being disseminated by various 
news media, unfortunately) is fundamentally mistaken. Neither 
the Presidium nor the deputies at the session under any 
circumstances rejected the principle of targeted subsidies for 
the needy, which could today help to a considerable extent both 
a stabilization of the economy and the preservation of funds in 
the Crimean budget. The Presidium sitting proposed, on the 
contrary, support for a program of targeted subsidies and the 
corresponding amendments to the budget. 
  But, a program! 
  And when no one from the government could intelligibly 
explain how the idea would be realized, when findings of the 
specialists whom it would concern are lacking, and when it is 
unclear where the funds for the preferential payment of targeted 
subsidies would come from, what is there to support? The Supreme 
Council not only is not opposed, it aspires to work and examine 
all necessary innovations of the government. But in six weeks 
the government has, strictly speaking, not once availed itself 
of its right of legislative initiative. On the other hand, it 
conferred, under the cover of the Supreme Council, the right, in 
fact, to raise the price of bread.... The electorate would not 
understand us and would be right. 
  And neither party nor geographical nor departmental 
sympathies or antipathies have anything to do with it here. A 
most important task of the legislature is to guard the interests 
of the electorate. And no deputy, I am sure of this, understands 
it as a desire to prevent the executive from working. But 
reforms, even the least reforms, need to be implemented more 
visibly. Which is what we are trying to ensure. 
  [Sergeyev] Many of the news media have reported the huge 
privileges specified by the law of the Republic of Crimea 
"Status of the Deputy of the Supreme Council of Crimea" that was 
adopted recently. What is the truth here? 
  [Mezhak] The truth is that the deputies should have an 
opportunity to function normally. I have not encountered in a 
single newspaper a comparison of what you termed privileges for 
the Crimean deputies with the corresponding Ukrainian, Russian, 
Tatar, or other laws. But should we seriously be discussing the 
problem of whether the deputy should be running to the telephone 
booth to get through to a government official that has bogged 
down a voter's problem in bureaucracy? I would very much like to 
read in a newspaper or hear on the radio a competent, balanced 
evaluation of the law, not a desire to play in populist fashion 
on the morbid strings of the Crimeans. 
  Our deputies currently have one privilege--working by the 
sweat of their brow. But unless provision is made for the 
realization of this privilege, the people of Crimea will be the 
loser. So, if I were a journalist, I would take a look at this 
problem from this side as well.

<F P=106> [Report by HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent Volodymyr Skachko: </F>
"O. Moroz Does Not Change His Views"] 
  [Text] At a news conference in Kiev, chairman of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council O. Moroz stated that his trip to several oblasts 
and to the Crimean Republic was a working one and that its aim 
was "to get the peoples' approval or disapproval of the trends 
in the work of the new parliament and government." In Moroz's 
opinion, he received such an approval, because people were in 
favor of "strengthening order and discipline in the state and 
harmony in all spheres of life, irrespective of where a person 
works." Consequently, according to the chairman, the parliament 
and the government will continue their efforts to overcome the 
crisis in a concerted and responsible manner, and it may take 
between one and a half and two years ultimately to curb the 
crisis phenomena, as the deputies agreed. 
  Commenting on the situation in the country regarding 
presidential elections, Moroz stated that the talk on the 
absence of a clear-cut idea of what kind of president we need to 
elect is inappropriate, because there is a Constitution, which 
reads that the president is the head of both the state and 
executive power and, in order to change this norm, it is 
necessary to change the Main Law. Regarding rumors on the 
possibility of withdrawing from the presidential contest, Moroz 
joked: "It is a "canard," and the people who launched it suffer 
from "incontinence" of the "canard" ["utka" can mean both 
"canard" and "bed-pan"]. He added that he would not cede his 
votes to anyone, all the more so since, when he met with people, 
he "felt their genial support." 
  Regarding the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Moroz was 
quite 
specific: The fleet cannot be divided, it must be used jointly, 
under joint command, and with double responsibility for its fate 
on the part of Ukraine and Russia. Moroz believes that, in 
resolving problems of the Black Sea Fleet, one must proceed from 
the fact that the Black Sea Fleet is a zone of specific 
interests of our two countries and that a military entity cannot 
be efficient if some officers in it are paid better than others. 
Moroz also said that Ukraine must develop its own naval forces. 
As for a possible creation of joint armed forces of the CIS, 
the chairman of the parliament pointed out that he never voiced 
such an idea, and since 1992, he has been advocating the concept 
of creating collective security forces. "The broader the 
international structures for security provision, the more 
reliable the security will be," Moroz concluded. As for the 
proposals by the speaker [Ivan Rybkin] of the Russian State Duma 
on the creation of a confederation of Russia, Ukraine, and 
Belarus, Moroz said: "Those who do not regret the 
disintegration of the Union are heartless. Those who want to 
restore the Union today are brainless." In the 
Ukrainian-Russian relations, the chairman of Ukraine's Supreme 
Council, according to him, is in favor of resolving, first of 
all, economic problems and advocates Ukraine's coming out with 
the initiative of signing a multilateral document on economic 
cooperation, a document in which the main principle would be 
stated -- on the inviolability of the borders of the participant 
states. 
  Nor did Moroz change his attitude toward the problem of 
nuclear disarmament, which, in his view, cannot be tackled 
contrary to Ukraine's interests. Commenting on the accusations 
against President Kravchuk voiced by the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists [KUN] to the effect that he had betrayed Ukraine by 
transferring tactical nuclear weapons to Russia, Moroz said that 
KUN is entitled to voicing its opinion in any form, but the 
president's actions "by their content, conform to such 
assessments." Moroz spoke in favor of Ukraine's pursuing such 
active external policy as would not allow anybody to ignore the 
interests of our state. 
  The chairman of the parliament also answered other questions 
asked by journalists, and it became clear from his replies that, 
as a leader, he does not change his views from day to day 
depending upon the prevailing situation.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Shuvaynikov, chairman of the Russian Party of </F>
Crimea (RPC), under the rubric "Party Leader's Tribune": "Why 
the Russian Party Did Not Join the Russia Bloc"] 
  [Text] The article "Past Idols, Future Idols...." by V. 
Polyakov, a deputy from Simferopol, has prompted me to write 
these notes. In analyzing the course of the presidential and 
parliamentary elections, as well as the events that followed, 
the author attributed a subjective motivation to the actions and 
deeds of individual political leaders. Thus, in particular, 
having mentioned my name, he stated: "We can consider 
tribulations involved in nominations for the post of president a 
prelude for the forthcoming storm. What Mezhak understood on 
time, Shuvaynikov did not, and for this reason he paid for it 
dearly. The recent `Hyde-Park' idol turned out to be an outsider 
in the camp of the victors." 
  Having read this paragraph, a poorly informed voter may 
indeed think that Shuvaynikov "made a mistake" when he failed to 
withdraw as a candidate in favor of Meshkov and did not join the 
Russia bloc together with his party. Since they are trying to 
convince the 200,000 voters who voted in the first round for the 
candidate of the Russian Party of this, I am compelled to 
discuss the situation that preceded the presidential election 
and emerged on the eve of the creation of the Russia bloc. 
  As the residents of the Crimea may remember, a struggle for 
the institution of presidency began about one year ago. The 
Russian Party unambiguously determined its position as early as 
July: A president was necessary in the environment of a mounting 
political and economic crisis, and it was desirable for this 
post to go to a politician firmly advocating the position of the 
return of the Crimea to Russia, and then in a peaceful, legal 
manner. Unlike the Russian Party, the RPK [Republican Party of 
the Crimea] (the RDK [Republican Movement of the Crimea] party), 
together with its leader Yu. Meshkov, rejected the institution 
of presidency in the belief that it was being prepared solely 
for one well-known candidate. Moreover, Yu. Meshkov himself had 
doubts for a long time about whether to run for this position or 
not. Later, such doubts also overcame the RPK (RDK) leadership. 
The decision to nominate him was made as late as in the course 
of the campaign which had already begun. 
  Still before the beginning of candidate registration, 
several 
meetings were held between the representatives of the RNP 
[Republican People's Party] and the Russian Party at which 
scenarios for the nomination of a common candidate to counter N. 
Bagrov were discussed. Yu. Meshkov did not personally attend 
these meetings. Moreover, the last meeting before the beginning 
date of nomination was frustrated: Only I and S. Tsekov, the 
current speaker of the Crimean Supreme Soviet and leader of the 
RPK (RDK), met in front of the closed doors of the Bagram cafe. 
This is why the Russian Party, in carrying out previous 
decisions, was the first one to register its candidate and to 
begin the propaganda effort. Nonetheless, the problem of a 
common candidate remained because the danger of splitting the 
vote existed which gave N. Bagrov a certain advantage. 
  On the initiative of V. Klychnikov, the NPK [People's Party 
of the Crimea] executive committee chairman, three registered 
candidates--Yu. Meshkov, V. Mezhak, and I--met at the Bagram 
cafe on 9 December in order to specify positions and determine 
the principles for selecting a common candidate. There was no 
discussion of the Russia bloc yet; it was not even at the draft 
stage. I proposed the following scenario for our actions to my 
colleagues: 1) In view of the fact that the mass media tried to 
pit us against each other thus sowing discord in the ranks of 
our supporters, to make a statement in the press about the 
commonality of our purpose and the aspiration to designate a 
common candidate; 2) To hold as soon as possible a rating survey 
of voters in order to obtain objective data on the real chances 
of each one of us; 3) To give me, the candidate of the Russian 
Party, one week to coordinate all issues with the political 
council which had nominated me as a candidate. 
  After a certain period of doubt, V. Mezhak announced that he 
was prepared to withdraw as a candidate that very day, but only 
in favor of Yu. Meshkov. Ultimately, both candidates agreed to 
my proposal concerning the statement, charged me with preparing 
its text by Monday, and had no objections to the one-week 
deadline. 
  However, the events that followed indicated that the 
agreements reached were merely a tactical move; the RPK (RDK) 
and NPK leaders did not intend to comply with them. One day 
later, a meeting between Yu. Meshkov and V. Mezhak, and the 
contender for candidate, A. Kruglov, and activists of 
pro-Russian organizations was held in Sevastopol. Incidentally, 
A. Kruglov, while in the ranks of the Russian Party, voted in 
favor of my candidacy. Later, without adducing convincing 
arguments, Aleksandr Georgiyevich resolved to independently 
nominate himself for president and announced his departure from 
the Russian Party. I would not like to analyze the motives for 
his actions because Kruglov is a person who is sincerely devoted 
to the Russian idea. However, at that time he noticeably harmed 
the Russian cause, perhaps not being aware of this himself. As a 
matter of fact, a treaty on the common candidate Yu. Meshkov and 
the creation of the informal Russia bloc was concluded at this 
meeting to which I was not invited. On the same day, it was 
heard from the lips of Yu. Meshkov's supporters at an RPK (RDK) 
rally that Shuvaynikov was withdrawing as a candidate in favor 
of the Republican leader. 
  Someone might say that in politics all means are good if 
they 
justify the end. Alas, I do not think so; to put it mildly, the 
haste, impropriety, and unreliability of the two party 
candidates who had so rapidly "laid to rest" the achieved 
"gentlemen's" agreement put me on my guard. 
  When I brought the text of the statement on Monday it 
turned out that nobody needed it. NPK Chairman V. Mezhak 
demanded, in a form bordering on an ultimatum (according to him, 
suggested) that I withdraw as a candidate in favor of Yu. 
Meshkov and join the Russia bloc that was being created. I 
refused because there were serious arguments in favor of it that 
had great significance for the future political events in the 
Crimea. I outlined them to my comrades in the Russian Party, 
asking one question first: If the two leaders do not give much 
thought to choosing their means, what goal do they set for 
themselves? Why was a bloc with the attractive name Russia being 
so hastily created? 
  Long before the presidential election, the RPK (RDK) made a 
vigorous effort to create the People's Unity bloc in which the 
issue of Russia as a specific objective of Crimea's political 
movement would not figure and would be carefully avoided with 
references to the fact that this could give the Ukrainian 
authorities a pretext to accuse the Republicans of "violating 
Ukrainian legislation." 
  Therefore, only the Russian Party, which was labeled 
"chauvinist" and "Fascist," talked about Russia. 
  The People's Unity bloc was not to be, but the RPK (RDK) 
program to this day talks about an independent Crimea in some 
kind of an alliance with the countries of the artificially 
created CIS. The program of the People's Party which emerged 
later out of the RDK splinters sees the future of the Crimea in 
a confederation with Ukraine. I recall this deliberately because 
these two particular parties acted as the foundation of the 
Russia bloc abandoning for the election period their 
programmatic documents and adopting the slogans of Russian 
orientation which even the day before they considered "poorly 
timed politically" and even "instigative." 
  At a meeting of the Russian Party political council, the 
views concerning the Russia bloc and the common candidate Yu. 
Meshkov were also mixed. A majority agreed that the name 
"Russia" was being used by the Republicans for purely propaganda 
purposes, in order to attract a greater number of voters. In 
reality, the RPK (RDK) does not intend to give up the idea of 
building an "independent" [preceding word published in 
Ukrainian] Crimea. This does not suit the Russian Party because 
it views the independence of the Crimea merely as a stage on the 
way to the peninsula's return to Russia. For the Republicans, 
independence turns into some kind of an end unto itself which 
may entail unpredictable political and economic consequences, up 
to an armed confrontation and economic blockade. 
  A few members of the political council did not agree with 
the 
majority opinion and went over to the camp of Russia block 
supporters, accusing me of [bringing about] a split. 
  I am narrating this in detail because the time has shown 
that 
the majority of the Russian Party political council members were 
right. When I hear now from the lips of one of the Russia bloc 
leaders that the Crimean parliament never raised, does not 
raise, nor will ever raise the issue of the Crimea's secession 
from Ukraine, I ask myself this question: Was there such a thing 
as the Russia bloc? And if there was, what and who are the 
Crimean voters to believe now? 
  We did not join the Russia bloc precisely because as early 
as 
in winter the leadership of the Russian Party had predicted the 
current political events whereby the Crimean-Russian idea would 
begin to be forgotten or ignored. We did not join deliberately 
because we do not wish to bear the responsibility for a 
political course, which hinges solely on the idea of "an 
independent Crimea in an alliance with the CIS," rather than the 
idea of "political and economic integration with Russia with the 
subsequent return of the Crimea to it." Moreover, we have real 
apprehensions that the geopolitical factor of Turkey in the 
Crimea will be enlarged against the background of the 
Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which is being played out as if in a 
bad dream. There is a real foundation for this--the Crimean 
Tatar population that has returned from exile and has been 
granted special political privileges as a deported nation. All 
of this may only make more distant the programmatic goals of the 
Russian Party--the recreation of a unified Slavic state and the 
restoration of historical justice, the return of the Crimea to 
Russia. 
  For the Russian Party, and for me, its leader, power is not 
an end unto itself. All "pro" and "contra" notwithstanding, we 
supported the candidacy of Yu. Meshkov after the first round of 
the presidential election; we believe that at present the first 
president needs constructive assistance and confidence of the 
parliament rather than a search for his miscalculations or the 
mistakes made. Let us not forget that the residents of the 
Crimea now believe Yu. Meshkov and his pre-election promises, 
and we should not interfere with his keeping the promises. After 
all, all authorities are responsible to the people, and some 
time later the people will be entitled to hold them accountable 
for everything that has been bad or good, including the Crimean 
parliament which is learning the ABC's of legislative work with 
difficulty. As far as the Russian Party is concerned, we remain 
an association of citizens who are faithful to their 
programmatic objectives and tasks. We do not make our failures 
into a tragedy.

  [Text] Foreign specialists, who visited the "White 
Panther" [Bila Pantera] special-purpose battalion within the 
Kiev regiment of Ukraine's National Guard, were highly impressed 
by the level of training of the guards. One can imagine how 
surprised they might be if they had learned that the 
special-purpose guards' nourishment is worse than that of 
regular servicemen and that the average pay received by the 
commander of the battalion constitutes 400,000 coupons a month.

  The most acceptable and advantageous option for deciding the 
aircraft carrier's future is to sell it in its present condition 
(68-percent finished), according to Ivan Vinnik, deputy general 
director of the Black Sea Shipbuilding Plant. Another possible 
option for using Varyag is to remove everything possible from it 
and to sell its hull for use as a cruiser or other vessel. We 
will not break up the Varyag out of morale considerations, Ivan 
Vinnik stressed.

  [Text] The recycling of Ukrainian ammunition which has 
exceeded its expiry date is now being conducted by the 
joint-stock company "Alliyant-Kiev," formed in 1993 by the 
Shostkinskiy scientific and research institute, the U.S. 
Alliyant-Tecsystems, and Repirbase Ltd of Great Britain. The 
Ukrainian partner has 51 per cent of the shares in the 
joint-stock company. In the first quarter, "Allyant- Kiev" 
already received 5,600 tonnes of ammunition for recycling. The 
127 tonnes of extracted gunpowder were sent to the UkrVybukhBud 
explosives manufacturer and the 250 tonnes of brass cartidges to 
a nonferrous reprocessing factory to be reprocessed into rolled 
metal. 
  According to unofficial sources at the Defense Ministry, 
there are 320,000 tonnes of ammunition stocks in line to be 
scrapped.

<F P=106> ["Ukrainian Presidential Edict on Urgent Measures for </F>
Returning to Ukraine Hard Currency Illegally Kept Outside of 
Ukraine" issued on 18 Jun] 
  [Text] In order to return to Ukraine hard currency 
illegally kept abroad, I resolve as follows: 
  1. Ukraine's entrepreneurs, regardless of the forms of 
ownership they employ, must do the following within 10 days: 

  -  Declare at Ukraine's National Bank the availability (or 
absence) of their hard currency capital that is kept outside of 
Ukraine, specifying all sums, including those obtained as a 
result of engaging in entrepreneurship outside of 
Ukraine; 
  -  Submit to Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate 
declarations on the sums in their accounts in banks or other 
foreign financial institutions, as well as sums of hard-currency 
receipts in profits (dividends) obtained as a result of engaging 
in entrepreneurship outside of Ukraine. 

  In the future, such declarations must be submitted on a 
quarterly basis. 
  Ukraine's National Bank and Ukraine's Main State Tax 
Inspectorate must keep the pertinent information strictly 
confidential. 
  2. Determine that further external economic activity by 
Ukraine's entrepreneurs may only be authorized after they 
produce declarations envisaged by Article 1 of the present edict. 
  3. Bind all of those Ukrainian entrepreneurs who possess 
hard 
currency, deposited, in violation of the current procedure, at 
accounts or as investments outside of Ukraine, to transfer this 
hard-currency capital to authorized Ukrainian banks within one 
month; in cases where this cannot be done for objective reasons 
-- the deadline must be coordinated with Ukraine's National Bank 
and with Ukraine's Main State Tax Inspectorate. 
  Ukraine's National Bank must make public in the press, 
within 
three days, the list of Ukraine's authorized banks to which hard 
currency must be transferred. 
  4. Ukraine's Ministry of Finance, Ukraine's Ministry of 
External Economic Ties, and Ukraine's State Customs Committee, 
jointly with Ukraine's National Bank, must elaborate and 
implement, within 10 days, a mechanism to inspect the 
completeness and reliability of the data that is presented by 
entrepreneurs in fulfillment of Article 1 of this edict. 
  5. Ukraine's Ministry of Statistics, with the participation 
of Ukraine's Ministry of Finance and Ukraine's National Bank 
must approve and implement, starting from the third quarter of 
1994, accountability, on a quarterly basis, of all entrepreneurs 
for obtaining profits or dividends in foreign currency outside 
of Ukraine. 
  6. Ukraine's National Bank, ministries, and departments must 
report to Ukraine's law-enforcement bodies any information they 
have on violations in the established procedure of holding 
hard-currency accounts or using securities by Ukraine's 
entrepreneurs outside of Ukraine. 
  7. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers must submit, within one 
week, for the consideration of Ukraine's Supreme Council a draft 
law of Ukraine on the increased responsibility of Ukraine's 
entrepreneurs for concealment or illegal use of hard-currency 
profits. 
  8. In the case of fulfillment of the requirements stipulated 
by part 1 of Article 1 and Article 2 of the present edict, 
entrepreneurs will not be subjected to the sanctions specified 
by the current legislation and their management (officials) will 
not be brought to trial or be subjected to any other types of 
sanctions. 
  9. Leaders of ministries and departments and all 
entrepreneurs, irrespective of their type of ownership, must be 
personally responsible for the fulfillment of the present edict.

<F P=106> [Report attributed to VYBIR: "Money-Making Valves of the </F>

  [Text] Relations between Ukraine and Turkmenistan are 
beginning to normalize. The Ukrainian side announced this news 
through the major state dailies. Beginning today, Ukraine's 
debts to Turkmenistan, which totalled $671.9 million last year, 
will not be paid by the government -- there are no funds for 
this in the budget. A part of the payment has been ceded to the 
Respublika consortium. 
  This consortium was formed by eight companies. The chief 
founder is 31-year-old Ihor Bakay. The number and composition 
of the founders changes periodically, depending on the tasks 
performed by the concern. Earlier, Respublika dealt with the 
sale of canned food, fish, and beer, enjoying significant 
success. According to Ihor Bakay, Respublika would have never 
taken on energy resources if it had not made a bad go of it on 
the Turkmenistan market. 
  The consortium has not succeeded in settling accounts for 
supplies to Turkmenistan in time. Since there were hundreds of 
thousands of dollars involved, Respublika was given an 
alternative -- to take upon itself the payment of the debt, 
adjusting its own liabilities to meet this. With Bakay's 
approval, events began to develop in a fantastic way. Here is 
Bakay's account of what happened: 
  "Valeriy Ochakov, Turkmenistan's first deputy prime 
minister, 
immediately flew to Kiev to meet acting Ukrainian Prime Minister 
Yukhym Zvyahilskyy. True, the meeting did not introduce any 
significant changes in the deal. `The process was activated' 
only after Turkmenistan had cut off gas supplies. Yukhym 
Zvyahilskyy immediately flew to Ashgabat to meet with Niyazov. 
An agreement at the governmental level was signed after a 
couple of days. It was arranged so that the settling of 
accounts will be simple -- one-third of the debt ($224 million) 
will be paid in hard currency; the rest ($447.9 million) will be 
paid in commodities." 
  Even prior to this agreement, however, trains with products 
sent by Respublika to pay off the debt were leaving for 
Turkmenistan on a daily basis. 
  How could this be possible without permission from 
high-level 
authorities -- it is difficult to say. In general, this case is 
typical of the Ukrainian legal mess. Furthermore, Respublika's 
gas program was given tacit approval by the Cabinet of 
Ministers. Those trying to oppose their power have been 
deprived of their cushy jobs. 
  After the settling of accounts began, it became clear that 
Ukraine is not only sending trinkets to Turkmenistan. To cover 
the debt, Ukraine has to dispatch 70,000 tonnes of rolled steel, 
10,000 tonnes of foundry cast iron, 200,000 tonnes of processed 
cast iron, 150,000 tonnes of ferroalloys, 50,000 tonnes of scrap 
ferrous metals, 502,000 tonnes of aluminum, 140,000 tonnes of 
ammonia, 2,500 KRAZ trucks, 300 LAZ jeeps, 400,000 tonnes of 
grain, 80,000 tonnes of meat, and 100,000 tonnes of flour. In 
addition, $1.6-million worth of medicine and $20-million worth 
of special equipment for the Internal Ministry and other 
services. The complete list is 10 pages long. True, due to the 
efforts of officials from the Ministry of the Economy and the 
Ministry of Finance, some items were removed from the list, 
including 500,000 tonnes of zinc, hundreds of thousands of 
tonnes of aluminum, copper, nickel, lead, and expensive scrap 
nonferrous metals. 
  According to experts, the cost of goods proposed for barter 
exceeds the sum of debt by several times. It was evaluated 
that, having only used the credits allotted by the Ukrainian 
Government for this operation, Respublika will be able to garner 
profits in the area of $7 million. Moreover, profiting from 
price differences is also possible. Thus, Respublika will buy 
gas for $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. According to estimates by 
leading Ukrainian economists -- between $65 and $101 [per 1,000 
cubic meters]. The enterprises that pay three times as much for 
energy resources will increase prices on their goods, as well. 
As a result, imports of Turkmen gas by Ukraine can become 
unprofitable. 
  It is already known how the Ukrainian side behaves under 
such 
circumstances. During the latest price incident [not further 
identified], Yukhim Zvyahilskyy sold out a part of Ukraine's 
strategic resources. 
  It is not polite, as the saying goes, to look in someone 
else's pocket. We will add: providing your money is not 
transferred into that pocket. Taking into account the prospect 
for future price increases, we have asked Volodymyr Lanovyy, 
president of the Center of Market Reforms, to comment on the 
Ukrainian-Turkmen gas deal. He stated: 
  "This is a high-quality swindle. Having signed the agreement 
with Turkmenistan, Respublika is able to buy hard currency at 
prices three times lower than usual. In such cases, the 
exchange rate in Ukraine stands at 13,100 karbovanetses per 
dollar, while the market exchange rate is around 50,000 
karbovanetses. Turkmen gas going to the corporation is 30 
percent cheaper -- this money will remain in the corporation's 
accounts with each payment cycle. Furthermore, enterprises will 
be given obligatory state orders for the production of 
commodities for Respublika. In turn, Respublika will sell these 
commodities for hard currency, but the enterprises will be paid 
in devaluated karbovanetses. In addition, they will not be paid 
the full price, but only the production cost. The seller will 
also be a two-time winner here." 
  Volodymyr Lanovyy is supported in this opinion by Sumin, 
head 
of the Ukrainian Union of Lawyers: "With the help of such a 
structure, the national wealth of Ukraine and Turkmenistan feeds 
certain Mafia-like structures. Thus, a big difference between 
purchasing and selling prices is being transferred to foreign 
accounts. By the way, according to the Ukrainian-Turkmen 
agreement, the monetary side of the Ukrainian debt should be 
paid to an appropriate account in the Deutsche Bank." 
  They say that the country which sells its national resources 
to pay off debts may be declared bankrupt by the International 
Court of Justice in The Hague. The CIS has created an economic 
court, but, for the time being, this court is successfully idle. 
Therefore, there are no reasons for being ashamed. The deal 
will continue. The point is who will become the next exporter -- 
will this exporter be appointed privately and quietly in 
governmental cabinets, or at an auction with the largest profit 
for the country? Maybe, we would be able by this to avoid 
rumors over fantastic bonuses in gas imports? All the more so 
since competent sources report: Metals and bed pans are not the 
only commodities which Ukraine is ready to barter to acquire the 
desired energy resources. It is simply a pity that the blanket 
is too short and someone is going to catch a cold.

  [Text] A total of 61 percent of voters of the Ukrainian 
Zaporozhye Region Kamensk-Dneprovsk District have voted against 
the utilization of the sixth block of the Zaporozhye Nuclear 
Power Station. A total of 38 percent of voters voted for it 
during a referendum held along with the presidential and local 
elections in Ukraine. 
  Voters were asked whether it was reasonable to switch on the 
sixth block before a law on nuclear energy was adopted. The 
ballot papers also included a question on whether a storage 
facility for exhaust nuclear fuel could be built in the region. 
  An INTERFAX correspondent reports that 32 percent of voters 
were in favor of such a facility for exhausted nuclear fuel and 
63 percent were against. A total of 68 percent of the voters 
registered in the region took part in the referendum. 
  This referendum was initiated by the District Council.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- Boris Yeltsin does not support 
Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative on extending the powers of the 
Federal Assembly's deputies and on upgrading the status of the 
upper chamber, Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian president's 
administration, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. A 
relevant statement from the presidential press secretary is 
expected. 
  "The implementation of Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative would 
obliterate all our work for attaining civil and public accord in 
Russia. In addition, we should not provide the opposition with 
a pretext for accusing us of power craving", the Filatov said. 
In Sergey Filatov's view, the fact that the parliament's upper 
chamber today represents the interests of the components of the 
Federation is an exclusive achievement of the Constitution. 
According to him, the results of opinion polls show that fear 
of Russia's possible collapse and fear of civil war are 
decreasing in society. "The fear of the country's possible 
collapse has been overcome precisely because the new 
Constitution gives the regions an opportunity to implement their 
interests by approving or rejecting laws. To turn the 
Federation Council into a politicized body, therefore, would be 
"tantamount to death for the Federation," the head of the 
presidential administration stressed. 
  According to him, Boris Yeltsin shares Sergey Filatov's 
concern about Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative to revise a number 
of articles of the Constitution and invest the Federation 
Council with broader powers. 
  Asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent whether the presidential 
apparatus is going to appraise the responsibility of politicians 
for statements which destabilize society, Sergey Filatov said: 
"We are not a politburo; let the people, who elect politicians, 
appraise their actions".

  [Text] The proposal on putting off parliamentary and 
presidential elections could be implemented by prolonging the 
Pact on Civic Accord, Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray told Interfax. 
  In his opinion, such a move would appease a wide spectrum of 
political forces, including the opposition which he believes 
would support the idea of postponing elections in the absence of 
a realistic contender to Boris Yeltsin and in hope that such a 
contender will at some point emerge in the ranks of the 
opposition. 
  He also said that the Civic Accord Pact was "a document 
based 
on a certain balance of political interests and forces." "Given 
political will, it can easily be prolonged by amending the 
Constitution and by prolonging the powers of all branches of 
authority," he said. 
  He welcomed the political forces' newly acquired skill for 
coming to terms with one another, but noted that in the current 
complicated situation, early elections could also help to ease 
political tensions. 
  He also expressed the opinion that the proposal to put off 
elections was the Russian political elite's attempt to prolong 
its term in office.

  [Text] Yerevan June 27 TASS -- "A separate meeting between 
the Armenian and Azeri leaders would be senseless since the 
comprehensive settlement of the Karabakh conflict can be reached 
only by the three sides involved Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno-Karabakh," said Levon Zurabyan, the Armenian president's 
aide and his acting press secretary. "If such a meeting takes 
place, it should be attended by the Nagorno-Karabakh leader 
Robert Kocharyan," the aide said. 
  The representative of the Armenian president positively 
assessed the results of today's talks in Yerevan conducted by 
the Russian president's special envoy, Vladimir Kazimirov. The 
Armenian president's aide pointed out the importance of such 
working meetings for the clarification of positions assumed by 
the sides on the Karabakh settlement.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now present a report on the 
latest situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and the 
border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The latest reports from the NKR have confirmed that no 
incident has occurred in the confrontation areas. The sides 
have been trying not to allow any incident which may create a 
new tension in the region. In general, the cease-fire agreement 
is being heeded. The situation in the front line areas is 
peaceful, that is, not taking into account the shooting by 
Azerbaijan's military units from time to time. In view of that, 
we hope that the peaceful situation will not be temporary and 
that a result will be achieved through the talks that are held 
at various levels to convince the two sides to end the 
confrontation. 
  Regrettably, a stable situation has not been established on 
the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The reason for that 
state of affairs is the frequent shooting from Azerbaijan in the 
direction of various settlements in Armenia. Azerbaijan's 
military units have fired mainly on Armenia's Idzhevanskiy, 
Tavushskiy, Noyemberyanskiy, and Araratskiy Rayons. Other areas 
also have been fired on. It must be stressed for the sake of 
justice that the Armenian side has refrained from returning the 
fire in several cases. 
  The Armenian Ministry of Defense Information Service has 
disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units fired on several 
border towns in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon with various types of arms 
last night. The Armenian side did not return the fire.

  [Text] Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev believes 
inviting neighboring Iran and Turkey to take part in 
negotiations on Nagorno-Karabakh would be a positive factor. 
Aliyev was speaking on Sunday as he received the special 
Russian presidential envoy Vladimir Kazimirov at talks on 
Nagorno-Karabakh in Baku. 
  The Russian diplomat arrived in the Azerbaijani capital from 
Iran, where he had had consultations with that country's foreign 
ministry officials. He said consultations with the Turkish 
Foreign Ministry were due to be held shortly. 
  President Aliyev would like the current cease-fire to be 
used 
to speed up the process of negotiations. At the same time 
Aliyev said that Azerbaijan's conditions for a final political 
agreement remained unchanged -- Armenian armed detachments must 
be withdrawn from captured territories and Azerbaijani refugees 
returned to their homes. 
  President Aliyev promised that supply lines would be 
restored 
and the safety of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians as citizens of 
Azerbaijan ensured. President Aliyev said that a discussion of 
Nagorno-Karabakh's future status would depend on the 
comprehensive implementation of all those requirements.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 24/6/1994 -- The chief of the 
Federal Intelligence Service of Russia, Sergey Stepashin [name 
as received], arrived today in Chisinau. Sources from the 
Moldovan Ministry of National Security stated to BASAPRESS that 
the Russian dignitary is in Chisinau to sign an agreement of 
cooperation between the security services of both states. The 
draft agreement stipulates the coordination of joint activities 
in combating terrorism, smuggling, drug business, and illegal 
armament trade. The parties also intend to come to an agreement 
concerning joining forces in combating the illegal immigration 
of citizens of underdeveloped countries to Western Europe, by 
using the territories of Russia and Moldova as transit stations. 
The same sources announced to BASAPRESS that Sergey Stepashin 
will stay in Moldova two days and will meet President Mircea 
Snegur and Premier Andrei Sangheli. Stepashin also intends to 
pay a visit to Tiraspol. No terrorist acts were committed this 
year in Moldova. In 1993, the Moldovan frontier guards 
prevented the attempts of dozens of illegal immigrants to 
traverse Moldova.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze </F>
by correspondent Nato Oniani on 27 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, we should probably start 
today's interview, as we have done for some time recently, once 
again by discussing events in Abkhazia and the peace process 
that began there last week following the Russian Federation 
Council's approval. The arrival of peacekeeping forces in west 
Georgian rayons was shown on television yesterday. 
  Be that as it may, Zhirinovskiy has appeared in Abkhazia. 
[sentence as heard] Gudauta is visited frequently by the 
military and diplomats, who can rarely be seen in Tbilisi. Does 
it all mean that the settlement of the Abkhaz problem is a 
result of relations between Russian and Abkhaz leaders? Has the 
Georgian leadership found itself left out? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you and good morning. 
  The peace process in Abkhazia has started, as planned, with 
a 
preparatory stage, the clearing of mines, concentration of 
peacekeeping forces, the setting up of checkpoints, road 
repairs, and so on. It can be said that the start has been 
normal so far. The population of Samegrelo and Zugdidi, as well 
as the people who remained in Gali, have welcomed the 
peacekeeping forces. However, it must be said that the main 
difficulties will start when large numbers of refugees enter 
Abkhazia, which is the task for the next few days. 
  In this connection, good organization is necessary on this 
Georgian side of the Inguri river. What I mean is that groups 
of refugees should be formed and the schedule for their return 
to Abkhazia be determined. There is a lot of organizational 
work to be done. A permanent government commission, information 
center, construction and repair authorities will operate in 
Zugdidi. Many of them are already there. The prime minister, 
defense minister, their deputies, and almost all of the Council 
of Ministers of Abkhazia will work there. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani 
[chief Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] is planning to go 
there tomorrow or on Wednesday. He has contacts with the 
military, which is very important. In a word, things are moving 
forward. 
  As regards the arrival of various political leaders, this is 
less worrying. 
  [Oniani, interrupting] For example, Russian Deputy Defense 
Minister Georgiy Kondratyev's visit cannot be less worrying, can 
it? 
  [Shevardnadze] Do you mean General Kondratyev? 
  [Oniani] Yes. 
  [Shevardnadze] Let us first speak about political leaders. 
This is less worrying. It is probably inevitable that leaders 
holding various ranks and views will arrive there. However, 
friends of both ours and the Abkhaz will come as well, which is 
more important. Their active involvement and assistance, 
including Russian parliament deputies' involvement and 
assistance, should certainly be taken positively. As Vladimir 
Shumeyko [chairman of the Federation Council] and others have 
told me, there are such plans. 
  As for Gen. Kondratyev, I must say that we are having 
businesslike contacts with him. Ioseliani and Sandro Kavsadze 
[Georgian negotiator with Abkhazia] have met him more than once. 
There is no need for him to visit Tbilisi now. If it becomes 
necessary, such a visit will be possible. 
  Talking about visits, I would like to recall the visit to 
Tbilisi earlier this month by Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev and a series of extremely productive talks that were 
held. As far as this and other issues are concerned, I think 
that we will soon witness an increase in Russian diplomatic 
activity. 
  In general, it must be said that both Russia and Georgia 
have 
without any doubt assumed historic responsibility. We should 
hope, we should be certain that all sides will rise to the 
occasion, to this historic occasion and honor their 
responsibility, not only to our peoples but also to the world. 
  As regards Tskhinvali, as you know, the Tskhinvali process 
began in Dagomys and has produced some positive results. Now it 
is time to get actively involved in the settlement of this 
conflict. The experience of Abkhazia and that of other peace 
processes will naturally be taken into consideration. I believe 
that the settlement of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict is not a 
matter to be solved in the remote future but is something to be 
dealt with soon. The start has not been bad. It has shown that 
both the Georgians and Ossetians are thirsty for peace. We are 
moving in this direction, and we are moving with resolve. 
  [Oniani] A section of the parliamentary opposition has 
become, so to say, especially active recently and is getting 
anxious over the issues of authority. Why do you think a 
parliamentary crisis has exacerbated at this stage? Why has it 
speeded up so intensely at this stage? 
  [Shevardnadze] The stepping up of activities by any 
opposition can be explained if viewed against the background of 
various trends. As for the aggression by a part of the 
opposition, which is not a considerable part of the opposition 
anyway -- I can explain it by the fact that tendencies for 
stability in the country have been established and they [the 
opposition] are worried about it. 
  [Oniani] Batono [polite form of address in Georgian] 
Eduard, a meeting of foreign ministers of the member states of 
the Economic Cooperation of the Black Sea Basin Countries will 
start in Tbilisi in a few days. A year or two ago we could not 
have imagined holding an international meeting in Tbilisi. The 
reason why I am saying this is that there are signs that the 
criminal situation in the country is being stabilized. Last 
week, the Interior Ministry, together with the town's police 
department, carried out an operation -- this time in Tbilisi -- 
and the activity of the Interior Ministry is noticeable against 
the background of inactivity and endless promises by some 
establishments. 
  [Shevardnadze] The meeting of foreign ministers of the Black 
Sea Countries' Alliance -- this is what I call it, is 
undoubtedly of paramount importance. I think that the 
activities [of the Black Sea basin countries] all the way 
through from the last meeting in Istanbul to Tbilisi will be 
summed up. Time has been long enough. There is a lot to be 
discussed and all the more to be done. I am sure that 
representatives of key member-states will arrive and work 
actively at the conference and participate in partnership. In 
itself, holding such a conference in Tbilisi can be possible 
only under the circumstances of stability, a certain stability. 
The fact that we are holding this conference will speed up the 
reinforcement of order and will step up the fight against 
reinforcing order. In this connection, words of gratitude must 
be spoken for the police, of course, in connection with the 
operation that has recently been carried out in Tbilisi. As we 
have touched upon the issue of the police, we are going to 
discuss this issue on 8 July when we will sum up the work done 
for the last six months and we will discuss all structures. 
Interesting suggestions will probably be voiced to the effect 
of reinforcing these good tendencies and setting new goals; but 
large-scale operations must be carried out in rayons, towns, and 
residential districts so that every family feels secure and safe 
and feels that they are protected by the state. I think that we 
are gradually getting there. 
  [Oniani] Because of the current economic crisis in Georgia, 
our population looks with hope at every visit abroad and at 
every meeting with representatives of financial circles. After 
your visit to the United States, no one was surprised by the 
recent visit to the United States by National Bank President 
Nodar Javakhishvili and Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia. 
You had a meeting with them yesterday. Is there anything in 
prospect that will alleviate our population's difficult 
conditions? 
  [Shevardnadze] Our cooperation with the World Bank and the 
IMF entered an active phase during my visit to Washington. 
There had been visits and meetings before but they had mainly 
been concerned with formalizing our membership of these 
organizations. We had productive talks with leaders of these 
two extremely important international economic and financial 
organizations. Both the World Bank and the IMF were represented 
at the talks by all their leaders. As a result of these talks, 
several delegations have visited Georgia and prepared 
recommendations for further progress in our relations and for 
arriving at specific decisions [as heard]. 
  In my opinion, the recent visit by Basilia and Javakhishvili 
was undoubtedly productive. They are unanimous in Washington in 
stressing the importance of a stable political and criminal 
situation, which has recently taken shape in Georgia. If we 
continue our efforts to ensure stability, then we can hope to 
receive significant assistance roughly in the fall, or a little 
earlier. This assistance will serve as a certain factor and 
guarantee for financial stability in the country. 
  [Oniani] An important event happened last week. Russia 
joined the Partnership for Peace initiative. Fortunately, no 
one is surprised today by the fact that the country that 
constituted the core of the Warsaw Pact and was an 
irreconcilable ideological enemy of the United States, the 
entire capitalist world, and especially NATO, has joined this 
initiative. After events of recent years this no longer seems 
absurd. What is your assessment of this decision by Russia, 
especially taking into account the preparatory period that 
preceded this decision. 
  [Shevardnadze] I had an opportunity during our previous 
interviews to welcome statements in this regard by the Russian 
President Mr. Yeltsin and Defense Minister Grachev's assessment 
of his visit to Brussels. Now something that was meant to 
happen has happened, and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has 
signed a document making Russia part of this initiative. I 
again welcome Russia's joining this initiative. I believe that 
it was another step toward a new life and order in the 
post-communist world. 
  [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to 
Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian Parliament and 
head of state.
