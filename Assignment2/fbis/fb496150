<F P=106> [Report on interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European </F>
commissioner for foreign trade, by Mark Frankland and Dick 
Leonard; place and date not given: "The Tory With a Message: 
Europe Is Good for You"] 
  [Text] As befits a man who is fighting two Euroelection 
campaigns -- a personal one to succeed Jacques Delors as 
president of the European Commission as well as the British 
Euroelections -- Sir Leon Brittan chooses his words with care 
when talking about the Conservative Party and Europe. 
  The Tories divided? Not so, he protests with a languidly 
elegant movement of the hands: their election manifesto has 
`accommodated' all sections of the party. `Now, if you said all 
the parties are responding to an unhappy and querulous national 
mood in relation to the European Union, then I'd agree.' 
  But in a conversation with THE OBSERVER, the wary Sir Leon 
did react to the latest Tory idea to deconstruct the Commission, 
where he is in charge of international economic relations. 
David Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office Minister, last week 
suggested the Commission emasculate itself by handing over its 
right to introduce legislation to the Council of Ministers. 
  `It would never work,' says Sir Leon, insistent as a 
barrister used to talking to not very bright juries. `The 
essence of the Council of Ministers is that it is 12 
governments.' The Council is equipped to `consider proposed 
laws and decide on them, which is exactly what it does, but it 
cannot produce them.' 
  Sir Leon does not believe `a fundamental change in the 
Commission's role is in anybody's interest.' Nor is the 
Commission too `undemocratic.' People who `criticise the 
Commission for being unelected would hate the consequences of it 
being elected, because if it was, you would be well on the way 
to an embryonic European government.' 
  Happy to demolish Heathcoat-Amory, Brittan is more guarded 
about a nationalist John Major confessing that his spirit sinks 
whenever he has to leave Britain's shores. `Just a statement of 
a patriotic kind. If that's the way he feels, that's the way he 
feels.' 
  It is obviously not the way Sir Leon feels, for a Tory more 
comfortable in Europe is hard to imagine. Shortly after 
arriving in Brussels to take up his job at the Commission, 
Brittan invited Jacques Delors home to dinner, unawed by the 
formidable president and ready to entertain him in French. 
  If Brittan now hopes to succeed Delors, it is because he 
applied the generalist skills of the British politician to the 
traditionally compartmentalised world of the Union. `Wisely or 
unwisely, over a period of time I've poked my nose into other 
people's business and made speeches about everything under the 
sun.' 
  Brittan's spirits seem equally high on his frequent trips to 
speak at British Euroelection meetings. His message is bullish: 
Europe, including that Tory taboo, European monetary union 
[EMU], is good for you though you may not yet know it. 
  `Britain can be relaxed about EMU. Nobody's pushing Britain 
to join, just as nobody is pushing us to rejoin the European 
exchange rate mechanism. Britain has secured the rather 
remarkable position of having an option (to join EMU) but not an 
obligation -- as near as you can get in politics to having your 
cake and eating it.' 
  He insists the convergence of European economies that is a 
precondition for monetary union will be achieved, and that EMU 
itself will reduce costs, to everyone's advantage, of trading in 
the European market. `It is not unrealistic that, by 1999, a 
critical mass of European countries will be able and want to go 
ahead.' 
  His chief argument to the sceptical Brits is that the time 
of 
European Union excesses is over, and that it would be stupid to 
bolt when Europe is becoming British-friendly. 
  `Everyone was in favour of the single market and yet it was 
the creation of the single market which necessarily meant 
removing 12 national sets of rules and involved the most 
intrusive intervention in business and other life. Though 
people desired the end, they were not entirely happy with the 
means, and didn't appreciate the means were necessary to achieve 
the end.' 
  These wounds would now be healed by the salve of 
subsidiarity, explained by Brittan as `you don't do what you 
don't need to do, and don't hesitate to do what you can do 
best.' If water quality can best be assured by national 
governments, clean air is a pan-European concern. The result is 
that the amount of Eurolegislation proposed by the Commission 
has halved since 1989. 
  Brittan mocks the over-regulated, over-subsidised Europe of 
several years ago and says European institutions have to learn a 
lesson from critical reactions to the widespread Maastricht 
treaty. `By the way we conduct ourselves and by our vision, we 
must show that we're not trying to snuff out the nation state 
but to do together the things that are best done together.' 
  He offers the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a 
dramatic example of how Europe has changed to suit Britain. 
`When I began the international economic relations job, there 
were large numbers of people who didn't want a settlement at all 
because they said it was an Anglo-Saxon concoction, and what's 
this got to do with the great European ideal? But by the end, 
everyone agreed that the Gatt deal was good.' 
  Leon Brittan sounds like the best President of the European 
Commission the British could realistically hope to get, but few 
people in Brussels think Europe's leaders will give him the job 
when they meet in Corfu next month. The Belgian premier 
Jean-Luc Dehaene and the former Dutch premier Ruud Lubbers still 
seem more probable choices. 
  Asked if he is handicapped in the race by being British, he 
answers in his best old-fashioned courtroom manner: `I thought 
one of the fundamental principles of the European Union was that 
we weren't allowed to discriminate on grounds of nationality.'

<F P=106> [Article by Kevin Brown and David Owen: "Opposition Urges </F>
Farming Policy Shake-up"] 
  [Text] Labour and the Liberal Democrats yesterday called 
for radical reform of the European Union's [EU] "wasteful" 30bn 
pounds Common Agricultural Policy [CAP]. 
  Mr Gavin Strang, Labour's agriculture spokesman, said the 
CAP 
was "a shocking and unjustifiable waste of money for Britain's 
taxpayers." 
  He said: "Taxes are being wasted to build up beef mountains, 
butter mountains, lakes of wine, and in easy money for farmers 
to do nothing. The CAP is an ill-targeted investment which no 
loner serves the interest of farmers or rural communities." 
  Mr Strang said there was strong support among the Socialist 
Group in the European parliament to reform the policy, which was 
given only a brief mention in the group's joint manifesto. 
  He said Labour supported maintaining the EU's external 
tariff 
wall, which offers protection to European farmers against 
imports from other agricultural producers. 
  The party would also argue for the continuation of limited 
schemes, such as one which helps farmers on poor land in hilly 
areas. 
  Labour is seeking an end, however, to intervention buying -- 
which creates food mountains -- and export subsidies, which 
encourage dumping of cheap food on world markets. 
  The party will also press for an end to the controversial 
set- aside system under which farmers are paid for not growing 
food on specified land. 
  A Liberal Democrat policy paper, Reclaiming the Countryside, 
calls for replacement of the policy with a Common Rural Policy 
based on direct payments to farmers related to specified 
economic, environmental and social goals. 
  Mr Paul Tyler, the party's rural affairs spokesman, said 
farmers knew that the existing system could not last. He said 
the 840m pounds-a-year cost of the UK set-aside programme was 
"largely wasted." 
  The size of the paper it is two pages larger than the 
party's 
manifesto at 32 pages reflects the importance of a credible 
rural policy to the party if it is to make its long awaited 
electoral breakthrough. 
  The Liberal Democrats' best chance of making headway lies 
across a swathe of Tory-held territory in rural southern 
England, where it hopes to convince Labour voters the election 
is "a two-horse race." 
  In a clear pitch for the "Green" vote, the paper says a 
central aim of the proposed reforms is "to contribute to the 
objective of environmental sustainability." 
  Mr Tyler also sought to attract rural voters by claiming 
that 
the government's plans to liberalise the Post Office 
demonstrated the Conservatives' "complacency on rural issues." 
  Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, dismissed the 
proposals to reform the policy. She said that neither party 
"truly understands countryside concerns."

<F P=106> [Colin Brown and Patricia Wynn Davies article: "Labour Will </F>
Pick Its New Leader in July"] 
  [Text] An early election for the Labour leadership will be 
ordered on Wednesday [25 May] by the party's national executive 
committee (NEC) to preserve John Smith's "legacy" of party unity. 
  The successor to Mr Smith, who was buried on Saturday on the 
Scottish island of Iona, will be "crowned" in late July. The 
party leadership will face protests from left-wingers who want 
to delay until the annual party conference in October, but it 
believes a swift election will unite Labour for its summer 
offensive on the Government. 
  The campaign will officially begin on June 10, immediately 
after the European elections, but the campaign teams are already 
in action. Gordon Brown yesterday put down a clear marker for 
the leadership with a speech in Wales setting out his own vision 
for the future of the Labour Party. It was coupled with a 
strong plea for party unity. 
  ``We have too much to do together in the service of our 
country for us to hesitate or fail now in our task. We have 
journeyed, climbed, struggled and worked together too long for 
any discord to come between us and our goal. 
  ``Labour is the party that, itself united, is ready to unite 
this country,'' Mr Brown said at the Welsh Labour conference in 
Swansea. 
  Some on the left suspect a leadership fix. Activists in 
Wales feared the party was being bounced by the media support 
for Tony Blair. They believe a early contest will help Mr Blair 
or Mr Brown, and leave candidates from the left, such as John 
Prescott and Robin Cook, too little time to campaign on the 
issues, such as full employment, which John Edmonds, the GMB 
[General, Municipal and Boilermakers] union leader, put forward 
as a litmus test for leading Labour. 
  Sources said a July election is supported by David Blunkett, 
this year's party chairman; Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader; 
Larry Whitty, the general secretary of the party; and key trade 
union leaders on the NEC. 
  "We have to preserve John Smith's legacy of unity and 
strength. We want a short and effective leadership contest. We 
don't want to break up the unity in the party," said one senior 
Labour source. 
  Party unity may be put to the test amid growing signs that 
Mr 
Brown and Mr Blair may be forced to fight each other in the new 
transferable-vote ballots. While Mr Brown left trade unionists 
and party activists in no doubt of his leadership qualities. 
there were few signs it would stop the momentum behind Mr 
Blair. Support for him has steadily grown in the Shadow Cabinet. 
  Mr Blair's hopes were boosted yesterday by a poll in THE 
SUNDAY POST which put him ahead even in Scotland, Mr Brown's 
political base. The poll showed 37.3 per cent of voters 
favoured Mr Blair against 32.7 per cent for Mr Brown. 
  Calls to delay the Labour contest were led by The Campaign 
Group of left-wing Labour MPs. 
  Mr Blunkett, speaking on BBC radio, rejected warnings by 
John 
Evans, the Labour MP, who had told fellow members of the NEC 
that a July election may risk a legal chalenge, because of the 
practical difficulties in balloting thousands of constituency 
members and trade union levy payers. 
  "We will not be putting forward options that cannot be 
carried out, which do not fit the constitution of the Labour 
Party. We will all know what the issues are and above all, the 
style of leadership which will pull us together," Mr Blunkett 
said. 
  The bookmakers William Hill made Mr Blair the 2-5 favourite; 
Gordon Brown 3-1; John Prescott 4-l; Robin Cook 14-1; Margaret 
Beckett 25-1; Jack Cunningham 50-1 and Neil Kinnock 100-1.

<F P=106> [Patrick Wintour article: "Blair Blames `Uncaring' Society </F>
on Tories"] 
  [Text] Tony Blair, the Labour leadership favourite, 
yesterday attacked the Conservatives for ripping apart the 
social fabric of society and claimed Labour's task was to 
rebuild Britain as a strong civic society, "sustaining stable 
community and family life." 
  In his first speech since John Smith's death, Mr. Blair took 
an uncompromising and unashamedly moral tone to argue that 
strong employment and education policies were central to 
national renewal, and condemned modern Tory liberalism for 
producing "an atomised, uncaring rootless society" that was 
bound to breed crime and alienation. 
  "Over the past few years, there has developed a keen belief 
that we have lost our sense of purpose and direction as a 
country," he said. "One reason surely is that we have lost our 
identity as a country. The growth of social division, 
inequality and the disintegration of the family And the 
community have torn us apart." 
  Mr Blair said the task of the left was not to replace the 
Tories' crude individualism with old notions of an overbearing 
paternalistic state. "The task is rather one of national 
renewal, rebuilding a strong civic society and basing it on a 
modern notion of citizenship where rights and duties go hand in 
hand, where the purpose of social action is to develop 
individual potential, not subjugate it. We have to counter the 
belief ... that action by society to improve social conditions 
and notions of personal responsibility are incompatible." 
  He argued that his vision did not represent a change in the 
left's traditional philosophy, but instead a rediscovery, 
pointing out that in the l9th and early 20th centuries, families 
were brutalised by the industrial revolution as they are today 
by crime, drugs, unemployment and social breakdown. 
  "The history of workers' cooperatives, the friendly 
societies 
and the unions from which the Labour Party sprang is one of 
individuals coming together for self-improvement and to improve 
people's potential through collective action. We need to 
recreate for the 21st century the civil society to which these 
movements gave birth m the 20th century." 
  The speech will inevitably be contrasted with that made at 
the weekend by the shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown. But the two 
were made in very different contexts, with Mr Brown delivering a 
wide- ranging platform speech and Mr Blair offering a 
philosophical approach in a seminar organised by the Institute 
of Economic Affairs and the Family Civic Trust. 
  He argued: "It requires not a PhD in philosophy, merely a 
degree of common sense, to understand that if children grow up 
in a culture of low opportunity, poor education and unstable 
family life, then notions of good conduct and mutual respect are 
likely to disappear." 
  Mr Blair's supporters suggested the speech showed that he 
would not change his beliefs or style to win the election and 
that his concerns had a wide appeal in the public. 
  Nevertheless, after the European elections, Mr Blair is 
going 
to have to move out of the social field and prove his mettle on 
the economic issues.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Labour's Choice, the More Open the Contest, </F>
the Better"] 
  [Text] By deciding to hold its leadership elections in 
July, the Labour Party has ensured that John Major will not be 
unseated in a fit of panic after the European elections. 
Instead, for six weeks, Labour will be the focus of media 
attention. In most of the past 15 years, such close scrutiny of 
the Opposition would most probably have ended in political 
disaster. Whether this leadership campaign can be conducted in 
a spirit of constructive argument will be a sign of whether 
Labour has indeed matured into a party fit to be considered for 
government. 
  To hasten the procedure was wise. Already Labour is likely 
to suffer in the European elections from not having filled the 
gap left by John Smith's death. To have left the leadership 
unresolved through the summer would have been to invite a long 
campaign from which the contestants would have emerged stale, 
exhausted and possibly embittered. Margaret Beckett has not 
only saved the party money by conceding a contest for deputy 
leader on the same day; she has also prevented the risk of the 
second placed candidate in July deciding to challenge her for 
deputy leader in the autumn. 
  Some in the party are still keen that a Blair and Beckett 
"dream ticket" should be adopted by acclaim without a contest. 
Others are hoping that Gordon Brown will refrain from standing 
so as not to muddy the modernising message of Tony Blair. Both 
are misguided. The Labour Party would do far better to hold an 
open contest with as many contenders as want to compete. 
  The transferable voting system that the NEC [National 
Executive Committee] has chosen means that there is little 
danger of Mr Blair and Mr Brown splitting the modernisers vote 
and letting John Prescott in. If the two men are united on 
policy, then it is right that they should each set out their 
personal visions of the future of the Labour Party so that their 
electorate can decide which articulates them better. 
  As long as the contestants avoid attacking each other, this 
debate will be good for Labour. For six weeks, senior shadow 
Cabinet members will have a free run in the media, unopposed by 
their Conservative counterparts. The more contestants there 
are, the more talents will be on show to the voters. 
  This is a chance too to define a new Labour Party. However 
successful Mr Smith was at uniting the party and attacking the 
Tories, his was still a holding operation. He had not spelled 
out his philosophy; and the lacuna was allowed to continue while 
feuding Conservatives captured the news. The only pledge he 
made in his leadership campaign was to introduce 
one-member-one-vote into party elections. The contenders in 
this much more closely fought campaign will not have the luxury 
of silence. 
  Yet their arguments need not be divisive. Neil Kinnock and 
Mr Smith encouraged Labour to shed its old nostrums. There is 
now a thirst for the new. Mr Blair, in particular, seems ready 
to quench it with his talk of a new compact between the 
individual and the community. After more than a decade of 
successfully promoting the individual over the collective, 
voters are starting to think further ahead. Many fer moral 
breakdown and yearn for a politics that talks of duties as well 
as rights, responsibilities as well as entitlements. Senior 
Conservatives, led by Michael Portillo and Michael Howard, have 
entered this ground. But so can Labour. Mr Blair called on 
Tuesday for "a modern notion of citizenship," where rights and 
duties go hand in hand. Under the spotlight of a leadership 
contest, he and his colleagues can spell out more precisely what 
these notions mean to them.

<F P=106> [Richard Ford article: "Government Defends 1 Million Pounds </F>
Price Tag on Immigration"] 
  [Text] The Home Secretary yesterday defended new 
immigration rules that will allow foreign millionaires to get 
round strict controls if they invest 750,000 pounds in 
government bonds or shares. 
  Opposition parties and immigrant welfare groups condemned 
the 
move, but Michael Howard dismissed the criticism as claptrap and 
said there had been only a modest change to existing regulations. 
  The Government said it wanted to encourage investment, with 
the prospect of creating more jobs and employment opportunities. 
But immigrant groups said the change showed there was "one law 
for the rich and one for the poor." 
  Mr Howard said the new regulations would enable people who 
could make a contribution to the economy of Britain to settle 
here. Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said: "I know 
of no country in the world that cuts off its nose to spite its 
face by saying, `If you want to invest in business and jobs 
here, you cant actually live here.'" 
  From October, foreign "entrepreneurial investors" with 1 
million pounds at their disposal will be able to bypass usual 
entry rules as long as they invest 750,000 pounds in government 
bonds, shares or corporate bonds and intend to make their main 
home in Britain. 
  Under existing rules, special provision is made for foreign 
residents with 200,000 pounds cash or 20,000 pounds a year to 
dispose of in Britain, or for businessmen who have 200,000 
pounds cash and set up a business that creates at least two jobs 
for Britons. 
  Graham Allen, Labour spokesman on immigration, said: ``Under 
these arrangements, if you are a millionaire, you will get in. 
If you are an ordinary person, a husband trying to reunite with 
his wife, for instance, it is a lot tougher. 
  ``I would like to know who these millionaires are. Who will 
be granted access to the United Kingdom? Will it include the 
drug barons, heavy donors to the Conservative Party and those 
involved in financial scandals?'' 
  Claude Moraes of the Joint Council for the Welfare of 
Immigrants said the move was an insult to the black and Asian 
men and women who had built their own businesses in Britain. 
They had not been given any special treatment and had used 
their entrepreneurial flair to exploit opportunities. 
  Mr Howard's action follows a report in March that urged the 
Government to adopt a selective immigration policy to address 
skills shortages and create jobs and investment. The report, 
published by the Institute of Public Policy Research, 
highlighted policies adopted by America and Canada to attract 
entrepreneurs. 
  Other changes to immigration controls announced by the 
Government include a clampdown on those who abuse the rules, 
such as private students and medical patients, and efforts to 
remove sexual discrimination.

  [Text] Mulhouse (DPA) -- The 63d Franco-German summit 
opened in the Alsace city of Mulhouse on Monday [30 May] 
afternoon. After a welcome ceremony with military honors, French 
President Francois Mitterrand and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
met for a first round of talks. 
  As in the meeting that will follow between Kohl and French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, talks will focus on European 
issues. In the parallel talks in Mulhouse, the numerous 
ministers of both countries will also discuss the coordination 
of policies in the EU Presidency that Germany will take over on 
1 July and pass on to France on 1 January 1995.

  [Text] Berlin -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of 
state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning 
[29 May], according to his lawyer. Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who 
had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 
1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker 
had rejected an operation. However, everything that was 
sensible had been done with regard to his cancer. 
  Becker could not comment on the exact cause of Honecker's 
death. His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that 
the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from 
his liver cancer. 
  Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will 
or where the funeral would be held. This will be decided by the 
family. 
  He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had 
informed Becker of her husband's death, will be allowed to stay 
in Chile. After being released from prison in 1993, Honecker 
had traveled to Santiago to join his daughter, who is married to 
a Chilean. Since then, he and his wife had been living in a 
house in a wealthy Santiago area.

CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The burgeoning presidential campaign of 
Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac was discussed 
in the French press. 
<H5>  Chirac Delays Announcement of Candidacy </H5>
  According to Gilles Bresson writing in the 9 May Paris daily 
LE MONDE, Chirac is profiting from the drop in Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur's popularity, which is affording him a margin 
of maneuver he had been unable to achieve since last summer. A 
"pragmatic" Chirac who is "ill at ease in the domain of ideas" 
is at tempting to give the impression he can "offer a dream" by 
affirming that he is working on a program out lining the France 
of the year 2000, Bresson wrote. This initiative is supposed to 
lend him the "aura of a visionary" and elevate him above the 
other candidates and Edouard Balladur who, according to Chirac, 
"still has his hands in the grease." The RPR leader has decided 
to reveal his vision of the future piecemeal during his trips to 
the provinces, a move allowing him to dominate headlines in 
local papers and television news for months. When Balladur was 
high in the polls Chirac had planned to go on the offensive by 
unveiling his entire program at the end of June. He has now 
decided against this strategy for fear of moving too soon. 
Bresson quoted a close Chirac aide as saying that "Chirac is 
afraid of declaring himself a candidate at the wrong time and 
trusts no one." Chirac is currently courting centrists by 
accepting Dominique Baudis as head of the majority list for the 
European Parliament elections and making overtures to his 
partners, such as his promise to consider centrist Pierre 
Mehaignerie for prime minister if he were elected president. 
Chirac aides are also recruiting French Democratic Union (UDF) 
deputies, who would give official support to a Chirac candidacy. 
<H5>  Chirac Choices Assessed </H5>
  Chirac is facing a number of decisive choices, Frederic 
Gerschel writes in the 12 May Paris weekly PARIS MATCH. The 
first is finding a "propitious" time to declare his candidacy, 
which could be at the beginning of September. However, a number 
of his aides argue that a premature disclosure could favor 
Balladur, who has long maintained he will not discuss the issue 
before January 1995. Gerschel cited a Chirac aide as saying 
that "Balladur will entertain ambiguity as long as possible 
because he knows that a declared candidate immediately becomes 
suspect." A second choice centers on the attitude Chirac must 
adopt. Chirac wants to be seen as above "pedestrian" matters, 
to put the finishing touches on his image as a politician 
concerned with major problems. A third focuses on the program 
he will present to the French people. Chirac has set up a group 
of about 60 experts and parliamentarians to formulate proposals. 
Unemployment will be a major issue, Gerschel noted, citing 
Chirac's entourage as declaring that the difference between 
their man and Balladur may well reside in "the primacy of the 
social field over the economic." While Balladur has maintained 
that one should not get caught up in such a debate because 
"there is no social progress without a strong economy," Chirac 
has been advocating a "new social contract that would break with 
the status quo." Noting that Chirac has twice "rendered homage" 
to Philippe Seguin, the declared adversary of the prime 
minister's economic policies, Gerschel concluds that a possible 
Chirac-Seguin ticket is increasingly being considered.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Allies Table Bill To </F>
Lift Fascist Ban"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- A group of Reformist 
(ex-Radical party) MPs, external allies of the Berlusconi 
government, today tabled a bill calling for the scrapping of two 
Constitutional articles banning the recreation of the prewar 
Fascist Party and the return to Italy of members of the former 
royal family, the House of Savoy, exiled since soon after the 
war. 
  A statement stressed that the move was libertarian in 
inspiration. A similar proposal was presented to parliament by 
the Reformists' predecessors, the civil libertarian Radicals, in 
1982. 
  In their statement, the six signatories to the bill said 
that 
"it is just at this difficult time that one must affirm with 
intransigence and rigour the values of that same liberal 
tolerance, that safeguarding of all freedoms starting with 
freedom of speech, that were and are the inspiration and the 
founding criterion of antitotalitarian antifascism." 
  "It is at a time that the postfascists have obtained full 
legitimacy, while legitimate concerns have been raised, that 
rigorous tolerance must be affirmed in all its force," the 
Reformists said, apparently in reference to a threatened 
encroachment on free speech in the wake of a national rally of 
neo-Nazi skinheads 10 days ago. Two officials at the northern 
town of Vicenza, the scene of the march, were sacked by Interior 
Minister Roberto Maroni, who said there would be no repetition, 
and yesterday declared war on extremists of all stripes. 
  The bill is identical to one represented on May 16 by 
Foreign 
Undersecretary Vincenzo Trantino, of the hard right National 
Alliance, immediately disowned and withdrawn by party leader 
Gianfranco Fini, who has stepped up his drive to distance what 
he calls the "postfascist" Alliance from the neofascist roots of 
its major component, the Italian Social Movement. 
  The libertarian MPs' stance contrasted somewhat with that of 
Fini, who has repeatedly condemned neo-Nazis as "racist idiots" 
and said that those who took part in the Vicenza march should be 
"sent to the salt mines." Around 30 young members of the 
Italian Social Movement who took part in the march were 
immediately ejected from the party. 
  But the move by one of the conservative government's smaller 
and lesser-known allies -- who have not actually entered 
government, but profess "external support" -- will do little to 
snuff flickering international concern over the presence in the 
Berlusconi cabinet of three ministers and numerous 
undersecretaries from the Italian Social Movement. 
  Italy's partners have been assured by Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino, in Brussels last week and in 
Washington yesterday, that Berlusconi's is essentially a 
centrist government and that the National Alliance's moves away 
from the Italian Social Movement are strong and sincere.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Giovanni Sartori: "Berlusconi's Promises"] </F>
  [Text] We have a government. What now? Having a 
government is not the same thing as having governability, that 
is, a government capable of governing, having the strength to 
govern. Berlusconi has leapt into the saddle, but his steed has 
every appearance of being an tired old horse. 
  The new government has at least two weaknesses. The first is 
that it has an incomplete, or at least precarious, majority. 
Berlusconi gained his confidence vote in the Senate by a single 
vote "fabricated" by means of absences and abstentions. A 
single vote is nothing. And neither is it true that all the 
government needs (still in the Senate) is a handful more votes. 
  In order to be able to govern without daily hindrances and 
anxieties, it needs about another 30 votes. Nobody yet knows 
whether Berlusconi will be able to obtain them, or how he could 
do so. Berlusconi knows how to charm people with his smile, but 
he will need more than smiles. 
  The Berlusconi team's second weakness is the fact that it is 
not a team. The first problem is that Berlusconi has chosen -- 
or in any case allowed to have imposed on him -- too many 
second-league (and even fourth-league) players. Apart from which 
his players -- especially the best ones -- are almost all in the 
wrong positions -- backs assigned to the attack, wingers playing 
center-field, and goalkeepers all over the place. And the 
biggest problem is that his team was not born to play a team 
game. One-third of the group are playing for an Inter victory, 
one-third for a Milan victory, and the other third for a Catania 
victory. Leaving the soccer field for the field of government, 
I would say this: Italy is accustomed to having disunited and 
uncooperative coalition governments, but the government of the 
so-called pole for freedoms promises to beat all records for 
disunity. 
  However much power may unite and create solidarity, the fact 
remains that we have inaugurated a government with three faces, 
three heads, that we could call the "Trimurti government." 
  This observation implies no offense (indeed, rather, 
divination), since Trimurti is an Indian divinity portrayed as a 
single body with three faces -- that of Brahm, symbol of 
creation; that of Vishnu, symbol of conservation; and that of 
Shiva, symbol of destruction. I will not say -- even I do not 
know -- which of these will be represented by Berlusconi, Bossi, 
and Fini. But I am willing to bet that this Italian-style 
Trimurti will not be a harmonious one. 
  Of course, the weaknesses of the Trimurti government are 
counterbalanced by a strength. It is not merely the fact that 
Berlusconi is on the crest of a wave, that he can count on the 
(very great) strength of having granted the Italian people 
confidence and hope. It is also the fact that Berlusconi has a 
very big stick, as well as a carrot. This stick has already 
been displayed in connection with the Senate confidence vote: 
Either you grant us a vote of confidence, they shouted, or 
there will have to be another election right away. In fact 
neither Bossi, nor Fini, nor Berlusconi has the power to 
dissolve Parliament and call another election. This is the 
prerogative of the head of state. But even to those acquainted 
with the Constitution, the fact is that the threat of another 
election remains a credible one. The question is whether it 
would serve any purpose. 
  If the electoral law remains unchanged, it would serve no 
purpose: We would again have the same ridiculous and distorted 
election results that we have already seen. What would be 
excellent and would serve a very good purpose would be the 
electoral system indicated and promised in Forza Italia's 
election program, that is, a single-candidate system with two 
rounds. But now Berlusconi is saying that he prefers a 
different system -- a 100-percent British-style 
first-past-the-post system in one round, that is, with no 25 
percent proportional quota. 
  I can well understand that many electoral promises are bound 
to remain promises. The million new jobs are not dependent 
solely on the government's will. The reduction of the public 
deficit has hitherto been promised by everyone but nobody has 
achieved it (not even the Ciampi government). But if a proposed 
electoral reform held good two months ago, it cannot be 
dismissed with the excuse of force majeure. If you promise a 
two-round system and then immediately reject it, that is purely 
and simply breaking a promise. Your government, Mr. Berlusconi, 
prevailed not only by requesting a "technical" vote of 
confidence but above all by requesting confidence in your word. 
I therefore find it very unseemly that you have started by 
breaking a pledge, going back on your word. 
<H5>  Right To Change Your Mind </H5>
  Of course, I do not deny you the right to change your mind. 
But in that case you have a duty to explain yourself, you must 
explain why you have changed your mind. 
  I hope that your secret idea is not this: to free myself in 
the future -- by eliminating the proportional quota -- of that 
irksome handful of centrists (the Pact and the Popular Party) 
who now deprive me of a majority in the Senate. But if that 
were your secret idea, it would be a really bad idea, both 
because it is unworthy and because it is mistaken. The fact 
that you head a Trimurti government with a precarious majority 
is not the fault of the proportional component resulting from 
the existing electoral law (which I have always opposed and 
therefore feel no duty to defend), but is due to the fact that 
Italian cunning has already discovered how to circumvent the 
British system. [Radical leader] Pannella has not yet realized 
it, but on 27-28 March our parties succeeded in 
"proportionalizing the single-candidate system." 
<H5>  Electoral Prey </H5>
  How is it done? Like this. On the Left you maintain a 
nonexistent party, or you invent a new one; then you go to 
[Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto (or his 
equivalent) and say: Either you grant us 10-20 seats in advance 
by withdrawing your candidates, or I will field my own 
candidates in every constituency, in the knowledge that I may 
not win but also that I could make you lose. 
  And the same on the Right. You go to Berlusconi (or his 
equivalent) and use the same blackmail technique. After that, 
once the electoral prey has been captured, the so-called poles 
are recomposed, and in Parliament we find more fragmentation 
than ever. And that leaves those who believe in Pannella's 
remedies looking rather silly. 
  Of course, Prime Minister, you wield the electoral big 
stick, 
that is the power to threaten another election. But the stick 
that you have now does not resolve anything, and that of a plain 
single-candidate system would cause more confusion than ever. 
It would be more correct, and certainly more intelligent, to 
honor the promise made in your program, that is, to aim at a 
French-style single-candidate system with two rounds. Which is 
what is recommended by everyone who knows anything about it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cossiga Angry With Interior </F>
Minister, Talks to Letta"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 24 -- Former Head of State 
Francesco Cossiga spoke today with Cabinet Undersecretary Gianni 
Letta about what he said were the "irresponsible words" of 
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni on a query filed by Cossiga and 
told reporters he had chosen to confer with Letta and not 
Premier Berlusconi because Berlusconi is "also chairman of 
Fininvest." 
  "I delivered a letter to Letta for the premier on Maroni's 
irresponsible words. I chose to talk to Letta and not with 
Berlusconi because he is too high up for me, he's the premier 
and also the chairman of Fininvest," said the outspoken 
ex-president with reference to Berlusconi's business empire 
based on publishing and commercial television. "I'm not so 
presumptuous as to ask or demand to be received by the person 
who is also chairman of Fininvest," he emphasized. 
  The minister's "irresponsible words" were spoken in response 
to a question on the query in which Cossiga, now a life senator, 
claimed he has been placed under investigation by Sisde, the 
domestic intelligence agency, and asked the premier for an 
explanation of this step. 
  Maroni was quoted as saying, "Evidently Senator Cossiga has 
a 
solution in mind for Sisde, one which works through the 
destabilization of the structure. But the government and I do 
not intend to submit to any type of pressure." 
  Cossiga, in his letter to Berlusconi and in remarks today, 
also challenged the minister's statement that he would not 
consider replacing the national police chief, Prefect Vincenzo 
Parisi, "for the time being," as "an act of unpardonable 
thoughtlessness...which destabilizes the head of the police and 
de-legitimizes him in front of the law enforcement services of 
all Italy." 
  The life senator, who has served in his long career as 
interior minister and an undersecretary at defense in charge of 
special security and internal defense areas, said later he 
intended to have a talk with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Indictment Sought Against Andreotti </F>
for Mafia Ties"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Palermo, May 21 -- Palermo prosecutors 
have requested the indictment of former Prime Minister and now 
life-senator Giulio Andreotti for complicity in association to 
commit Mafia-style crimes, judiciary sources disclosed Saturday 
[21 May]. The indictment request filed today was the first 
formal move by magistrates toward putting Andreotti on trial 
since he was first placed under investigation more than one year 
ago. 
  Andreotti, a Christian Democratic veteran and for decades 
one 
of the most powerful politicians in Italy, in March 1993 was 
first notified he was under investigation on suspicion of Mafia 
links. Magistrates at the time asked that Andreotti's 
parliamentary immunity from prosecution be lifted. 
  The prosecution's case reportedly rests on testimony 
provided 
by six former Mafia members who decided to turn state's 
evidence, including Tommaso Buscetta, who 10 years ago first 
gave investigators a description of the workings of Cosa Nostra 
in Sicily but refused to talk about the links between 
politicians and organized crime. In more recent times other 
former Mafia bosses, specifically Gaspare Mutolo, Antonino 
Marchese, Leonardo Messina and Baldassare Di Maggio reportedly 
gave a clearer picture of these links. 
  Andreotti's defense counsel, Odoardo Ascari, in a statement 
today said that, one year after the first suspicions were 
voiced, no one has yet stepped forward to confirm the alleged 
"contributions" Andreotti gave to the Mafia by using his 
political connections to rig trials against organized crime 
bosses in Sicily. 
  According to judiciary sources, magistrates have been 
investigating possible connections between Andreotti and the 
Mafia slaying of Salvo Lima, Sicily's most powerful Christian 
Democrat, on March 12, 1992. Lima, a member of the European 
Parliament at the time, led Andreotti's supporters on the island. 
  Some former bosses have claimed that Cosa Nostra was able to 
rig trials by turning to Lima, and that Andreotti himself met 
some top organized crime chiefs in private. 
  Andreotti has repeatedly claimed he has never met Mafia 
bosses and could not do so even if he wished to because he is 
always under heavy police escort. But Palermo assistant public 
prosecutors Guido Lo Forte and Roberto Scarpinato today said 
investigations have shown that Andreotti "sometimes eluded his 
bodyguards." 
  The fact that the prosecution has requested Andreotti's 
indictment indicates it believes sufficient evidence exists for 
a possible conviction. [passage omitted] 
  Later today, it was learned here that three additional 
mafiosi who have become "pentiti," penitents or state's 
witnesses, have furthered the case against the life senator. 
The three were identified as Gioacchino La Barbera, Santo Di 
Matteo and Salvatore Cancemi. Barbera was said to have reported 
to investigators a conversation between Mafia dons Nino Gioe and 
Leoluca Bagarella on the feasibility of murdering Andreotti or 
one of his sons because of the powerful political figure's 
betrayal of Cosa Nostra. Barbera was quoted as saying, "They 
complained about the conduct of Lima and Ignazio Salvo and put 
up the explanation that these two could do nothing because 
Andreotti had, by now, changed policy in a direction less 
favorable for Cosa Nostra." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni, who is now on an 
official visit to Austria, was yesterday received by the 
president of the Federal Republic of Austria, Dr. Thomas 
Klestil, at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. The two leaders held 
talks centerd on bilateral relations between Uganda and Austria. 
Speaking to the press after the talks, President Klestil said 
that, although Austrian foreign policy is centered on Europe, 
President Museveni's official visit to his country is a proof 
that Uganda took a central place in Austrian relations with 
Africa. President Museveni on his part said he is pleased that 
Austria is assisting Uganda in the rehabilitation of the water 
system in Kampala and hospitals around the country. He 
emphasized that trade and investment, rather than aid for 
Uganda, are more durable and sustainable forms of cooperation 
between the two countries, and in this regard looks forward to 
increased Austrian collaboration, which he said will be centerd 
on business as well as other investment, to top up the abundant 
potential the country has. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Museveni Meets With Klestil"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- The UN Human Rights Commission's 
resolution condemning the genocide in Rwanda offers a 
possibility to bring about a cease-fire between the warring 
parties, Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni said in Vienna. 
  After his meeting with Federal President Thomas Klestil in 
Vienna Museveni said that efforts are being undertaken to bring 
about a cease-fire on the basis of that resolution. There will 
be an international trial calling the perpetrators to account, 
"because there can be no peace without justice," Museveni said. 
  Commenting on the Austro-Ugandan framework agreement on 
development cooperation that was signed on Thursday [26 May], 
Museveni said that real development results from investment, not 
from financial assistance. Investment is based on reciprocity; 
with neither party "a parasite living off the other." Talks 
with Austrian businesspeople have been very satisfactory, 
Museveni said. 
  Klestil told the press that the framework agreement will 
increase opportunities for cooperation. 
  Uganda is a country full of natural beauty and has been 
economically and politically stable over the past few years. 
With these words at the Austrian Economic Chamber on Friday, 
Museveni tried to establish contacts with the Austrian tourist 
industry and potential investors and trading partners.

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- The international community should 
confine itself to "purely humanitarian actions" in Rwanda, 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says: "One should not try to 
govern countries. This mistake was made in Somalia." Therefore, 
he is against a military intervention. 
  "If I take food from point A to point B and I am stopped by 
a 
gang, I can shoot them. If I evacuate civilians and someone 
wants to kill them, I can defend them. But this is different 
from the attempt to disarm the Somalis," Museveni said at a 
joint news conference with Chancellor Vranitzky in Vienna on 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  The Rwandan rebels are not supported by Uganda, he said. In 
answer to the question of where the rebels get arms from, he 
answered: "When we were fighting, we did not have a special 
country from which we got weapons. We either bought them on the 
black market or took them off our opponents." [passage omitted]

  [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by 
Gisela Hopfmueller at the Innsbruck University Hospital on 30 
May -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Gisela Hopfmueller was able to telephone 
the foreign minister at the Innsbruck University Hospital and 
ask him personally about his state of health this morning. 
  [Mock] Thank you. The operation on the vertebral disk was 
successful. Yesterday I walked a few steps, and today I will 
walk a few more. I hope I will be able to leave the hospital at 
the end of the week. 
  [Hopfmueller] Disk problems are generally very painful. Are 
you still in pain? 
  [Mock] No. Before the operation I was in great pain which 
was sometimes distracting. Since the operation, I have not felt 
any pain at all. I am still a bit suspicious. I was surprised 
that I have not had any pain since the surgery. After all, I 
had been warned that it would be unlikely that I would not feel 
any pain afterwards. 
  [Hopfmueller] Is the matter over with this treatment or will 
you need further treatment? 
  [Mock] The doctor told me that if I follow his instructions, 
everything will be fine. He is very satisfied with me. 
Occasionally, he seems to have some doubts, but I hope I will 
be able to dispel them in time. 
  [Hopfmueller] You mean the doctor doubts that you will take 
good care of yourself? 
  [Mock] Yes. I promised him that he will be pleasantly 
surprised. 
  [Hopfmueller] Foreign Minister Mock, there is only 14 days 
until the referendum on European Union [EU] membership. At the 
moment, there is the impression that the mood might swing toward 
a majority of EU opponents. Do you share this view? 
  [Mock] I am not so much worried about whether or not the 
mood 
is going to swing over, because, in the end, it will be the 
citizen who will make the decision on 12 June. For me, it is 
important to provide information -- as far as I can do here, via 
the telephone and via the letters that I get and that I can 
dictate -- about what is at stake -- namely, not the fate of any 
party or any person, but Austria's position in Europe for the 
next 50 or 80 years, whether we will have our say and 
participate in decisionmaking or whether we remain an appendage 
outside. 
  [Hopfmueller] You say you are still trying to provide 
information. Have we not meanwhile reached a point where 
emotions on all sides have in effect replaced material arguments? 
  [Mock] One can certainly note this. However, this does not 
change the fact that one still has to provide information, 
especially since emotions have replaced arguments. One must try 
to clarify misunderstandings, and to get rid of such abstruse 
arguments, such as that our water will be taken away and that 
the National Bank will export our gold to Brussels or some other 
place, and to get rid of such nonsense, which often frightens 
older people, in particular. 
  [Hopfmueller] Is it really possible to change something over 
these last 14 days before the referendum? 
  [Mock] Look, the matter is so important that one cannot 
constantly ask whether or not something is useful. If one is 
convinced of something, one must work until the very end, and 
then the voters will decide.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU Support to </F>
Ukraine for Closure of Chernobyl Must Be Part of Global G-7 
Action"] 
  [Text] The General Affairs Council decided that the 
European Union [EU] would attend the G-7 summit in Naples (8-10 
July) with a clear concept of assistance to Ukraine in the 
energy sector. This Community initiative aims to ensure the 
equitable international sharing of the financial burden 
represented by the closure of the Chernobyl power station and 
the parallel construction of (two) new nuclear power plants. 
The EU acknowledges that the problem of the closure of the 
Chernobyl station is a top priority from the standpoint of 
closer relations with Ukraine and that the question of this 
republic's energy supply also deserves to be considered at the 
earliest opportunity. It is in this spirit that the Commission 
has suggested that the EU, as part of an internationally 
coordinated effort: 

  -  Aid Ukraine to finalize the 
construction in progress of two new power stations, as long as 
Kiev agrees to eventually shut down Chernobyl; 
  -  Accept, given 
Kiev's point of view that Chernobyl cannot be closed before 
other new stations are operational, that the TACIS [Technical 
Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States] programme 
help finance essential safety improvements and the subsequent 
closure operations; 
  -  Agree to take over part of the construction 
cost of new stations in the form of a EURATOM [European Atomic 
Energy Community] loan, Ukraine being eligible to receive such 
loans following the Council decision of 21 March. According to 
the Commission, funding possibilities by this means currently 
total a little more than ECU1 billion (for all the Member States 
and third countries). The work of the Committee of Permanent 
Representatives resulted in the following guidelines, which were 
subsequently confirmed by the Council: 

  (a) more comprehensive study is still essential in order to 
evaluate the extent of the financing needed for the closure of 
Chernobyl and the scope and urgency of Ukraine's energy supply 
needs. In this regard, several Member States highlight the need 
for this country to adopt a global energy strategy; 
  (b) with regard to principles, several Member States are of 
the view that, instead of favouring the construction of new 
power plants, it would be better to encourage Ukraine to develop 
the rational use of energy and alternative energy sources. This 
point of view is not shared in full by the Commission, which, 
based on Kiev's view that this construction is imperative due to 
the urgency of ensuring the country's energy autonomy, considers 
that it would be unrealistic to envisage short-term solutions in 
another direction, which could also call into question the very 
objective of the shutdown of Chernobyl; 
  (c) with regard to the possible financing of new power 
stations through a EURATOM loan, the Twelve consider that it is 
vital to examine whether the financial conditions for the use of 
such a loan (risk, guarantees, etc.) are acceptable, keeping in 
mind that, due to the amounts involved, an important part of the 
available funding would thus be mobilized for Ukraine alone. 
Moreover, Coreper [Committee of Permanent Representatices of 
the Council] has pointed out that if the EC decides to launch a 
new international initiative and to use the EURATOM loan in this 
context, the loan would involve high amounts and would imply a 
corresponding guarantee provision in the Community budget; 
  (d) since this matter involves TACIS financing of safety 
improvements and of the subsequent closure of Chernobyl, Coreper 
has voiced doubts about the sufficiency of available funds for 
this purpose. Moreover, the question of the applicability of 
TACIS regulations has also been raised, as some Member States 
have pointed out that it would be advisable for TACIS to 
contribute to the building of a "sarcophagus" and the supply of 
equipment. The idea of intervention by the EBRD [European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development] Nuclear Safety Fund was also 
suggested. The problem of Chernobyl and Ukraine's energy supply 
is fundamental but is only one aspect of the action envisaged by 
the European Union in regard to this country. Also at issue are 
the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, the 
eventual link between this signature and Ukraine's adherence to 
the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as well as 
specific support for Ukraine's agriculture.

<F P=106> [Report by Paul Vanden Baviere: "Belgium Blocks Libyan </F>
Embassy Accounts -- In Application of UN Resolution 883"] 
  [Excerpt] Belgium appears to have taken the lead in the 
international campaign against Libya, or to have been too 
energetic. For the last month or so, it has been blocking the 
bank accounts of the Libyan Embassy in Brussels. It is said to 
be the only country with such a strict application of Security 
Council Resolution 883 of 11 November on blocking Libyan assets. 
  "Such a measure has not been taken by Italy, Germany, nor 
even France and the United States (against the Libyan mission to 
the United Nations in New York), two countries which are 
directly involved," Libyan Ambassador Muhammad Sharaf al-Fayturi 
said. He said the measure infringed on the Vienna convention on 
diplomatic relations. 
  Blocking the embassy's accounts is causing a considerable 
nuisance. To prevent electricity from being cut off, the 
accounts are being paid in cash. The ambassador and the other 
staff of the Libyan People's Bureau have not been affected 
personally. Their accounts have been left untouched. 
  The measure is a consequence of the sanctions imposed by the 
Security Council on Libya in connection with the so-called 
Lockerbie affair. This involved a bomb on a PanAm plane which 
exploded in 1988 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, 
resulting in 270 deaths. The United States and United Kingdom 
believe that two Libyans are the perpetrators and are demanding 
their extradition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, 29 May (EFE) -- Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes today said that negotiations have begun with the 
Cuban authorities to ensure no reprisals will be taken against 
the 114 refugees once they leave the Belgian Embassy in Havana. 
"We are trying to get the authorities' assurance that no 
reprisals will be taken," Minister Claes said. "The refugees 
want to issue a political message of despair," the minister 
added, stressing that the embassy is facing a space problem 
because it is not big enough to accommodate the large number of 
people who yesterday jumped the fence and sought refuge at the 
embassy. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that talks are under 
way 
in Havana and Brussels. The spokesperson did not specify 
whether there are well-known political activists among the 114 
refugees, 24 of whom are children. 
  "The refugees are led by a couple of doctors," Minister 
Claes 
said. According to the minister, the refugees "must not build 
up their hopes that their request for exit permits will be 
granted promptly." The minister added: "They know how the 
Cuban authorities work; they systematically deny exit permits." 
There has been only one exception to this rule; this was in the 
case of the Cubans who sought refuge at the Mexican Embassy in 
September 1993. They were issued exit permits shortly after the 
incident. 
  This is the third time that Belgium has faced a similar 
situation; however, never before has the number of people been 
so large. In 1990 four people entered the embassy, and in 
January seven others did the same. The last time a group of 
people entered the embassy it took several months of 
negotiations to solve the problem. 
  Foreign Ministry sources have said that this time the 
situation must be solved promptly in light of the problems such 
a large number of people create in such a small building. 
  Seeking refuge in embassies is a common practice; however, 
never before has an avalanche, such as the one observed 
yesterday, occurred.

Thursday [26 May]. The Turkish Government threatens to ban the 
DEP. Five DEP parliamentarians have been accused of treason and 
separatism and might be sentenced to death. Yasar Kaya, DEP 
honorary president and founder, is the owner of the OZGUR GUNDEM

<F P=106> [Report by Guy Depas: "Herstal SA: 350 Million Profit in </F>
1993"] 
  [Text] Seeking to balance its books, the Herstal Group 
(formerly FN [National Manufacturer]) has shot last year's 
target to pieces. Subject to accounting changes imposed by the 
principal French shareholder, Giat Industries, the Liege arms 
manufacturer is set to officially announce on 7 June a net 
consolidated profit close to 350 million Belgian francs, 
following a meeting of the Board of Directors specially convened 
in order to ratify the balance sheet for the financial year. In 
the previous year, the group had recorded a net loss of 1,125 
million Belgian francs. 
<H5>  Twenty Billion </H5>
  The profit is in line with the hopes expressed just a few 
months ago by Albert Diehl, the group's president: Over 20 
billion Belgian francs, in which the military branch (FNNH and 
Canon Delcour) accounts for just over 9 billion and the civil 
branch (Browning-Winchester) for almost 12 billion. 
  In both cases, performance has exceeded forecasts. Thus, 
anticipating the recovery of its U.S. subsidiary, USRAC, and 
virtually the only remaining problem being the Italian 
subsidiary, rather than a budgeted loss of 325 million Belgian 
francs (following a real loss of over 1 billion Belgian francs 
in 1992) Browning-Winchester closes with a negative balance of 
just 100 million Belgian francs. As work on the reconstruction 
of USRAC's U.S. factory is nearing completion, it should break 
even in 1994. A slight profit is even possible. As to FNNH, 
with profits of almost 500 million Belgain francs it is reaping 
the rewards of diversifying its markets. 
<H5>  Full Risk Cover? </H5>
  What a contrast! The Herstal SA results come at a time when, 
from Paris, news of the parent company is so bad that its 
directors are placing all their hopes in either a rapid 
recapitalization, 2 billion French francs [Fr] or 12 billion 
Belgain francs are being requested from the government, or 
European regroupings. 
  The net loss recorded by Giat Industries for last year 
amounts to Fr1.2 million or 6.2 billion Belgain francs, which 
makes a total loss of Fr2.3 billion or almost 14 billion Belgian 
francs since 1990, the crucial year when the group swapped its 
status as a state company to that of a limited liability company 
with shares owned by the public. 
  A possible European regrouping with dangers for Herstal SA? 
They remain optimistic in Liege. Nobody, they say, is going to 
dismantle or sell a subsidiary in which investments are being 
made (2.5 billion Belgain francs) and which is absorbing the 
losses of its parent company. But the success of Herstal SA is 
also due to its autonomy and this autonomy has been earned, 
Albert Diehl likes to say. The Meuse FGTB [General Belgian 
Workers' Confederation] is considering a reduction in the work 
week to 32 hours in order to stimulate new recruitment. Diehl 
would not refuse to discuss this, provided no extra costs for 
the company are involved. Therein lies the debate, and the 
challenge!

<F P=106> [Report by Elisabeth Auvillain: "Roman Herzog: President </F>
of the Whole of Germany"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The CDU's [Christian Democratic 
Union] Roman Herzog will have a difficult task continuing the 
work started by Richard von Weizsaecker, his predecessor, who 
constantly called for tolerance and the acceptance of 
differences. Since unification, Germany has been going through a 
period of instability and uncertainty, which has led some young 
extremists to use foreigners as scapegoats for all society's 
ills. The result is that attacks on foreigners are increasing. 
  In the more strictly political sphere, Roman Herzog's 
victory 
is a success for Chancellor Kohl, who had seemed to make an 
error of judgment, which is rare for him, by proposing the 
candidacy of Saxony Justice Minister Steffen Heitmann. The 
latter had been forced to withdraw after angering many 
politicians, even within the CDU by expressing particularly 
conservative opinions. His nomination led the liberals (FDP 
[Free Democratic Party]) to propose their own candidate, Mrs. 
Hamm-Bruecher, and to maintain her even after Heitmann's 
withdrawal. 
  Herzog's election is also a success for the whole of the 
government coalition which, despite some provocative statements 
by the liberals over recent days, finally voted unanimously for 
the CDU candidate. It also strengthens the impression that the 
FDP is primarily anxious to stand by the government's side, 
wherever it is. 
  The supporters of the SPD [Social Democratic Party] are 
disappointed and simply hope that Roman Herzog, who cannot be 
described as a reactionary, will show openness and liberalism. 
The Socialists recently mentioned the possibility of having the 
president elected by universal suffrage. All the opinion polls 
show that, in that case, Johannes Rau would have been elected. 
But, although there is no doubt that Richard von Weizsaecker, 
who was a great president, was very popular, this cannot be a 
guarantee of competence, and history has taught that a man's 
popularity should be distrusted.

<F P=106> [Article by Rank van Zijl and Milja de Zwart: "It Was a </F>
Progressive Emasculation of Men"] 
  [Excerpt] On Thursday [26 May], the formation of the new 
government was pushed to the background for a day at the 
Netherlands Parliament. Politicians and journalists were 
preparing for what was generally considered to be unavoidable: 
The imminent resignation of Interior Minister Van Thijn of the 
Labor Party and of Justice Minister Hirsch Ballin of the 
Christian Democratic Appeal. 
  Back in April, Hirsch Ballin stayed at his post for 
so-called 
reasons of "national interest." National interest again seems 
to be the only term which could be used to explain Ministers Van 
Thijn and Hirsch Ballin being allowed to keep their jobs in the 
outgoing government. 
  In the deciding motion during the IRT [Interregional 
Investigation Team] debate on Wednesday evening, it seemed that 
the Parliament felt that Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn had only 
made the situation worse. They cast doubt on the credibility of 
politicians and the police. As the government itself is to 
leave office (the members have already offered their resignation 
to the Queen) there was no motion of no-confidence. [passage

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok Only Ready To Give Purple </F>
Coalition One Chance"] 
  [Text] The "purple" coalition is only going to be given one 
chance by PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok. If negotiations on a 
government comprised of the PvdA, the VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy] and the D66 [Democrats 66] fail, Kok has 
little inclination to return to the negotiating table with the 
same parties. 
  "In light of the urgent matters requiring a solution in our 
country, it is irresponsible to play games. We must make every 
effort to reach agreement," Kok warned yesterday. 
  He confirmed that "the distance between the PvdA and the VVD 
is traditionally, historically, and politically wide." 
Nevertheless, he finds it wrong to deliberately cause current 
negotiations on a possible "purple" coalition to fail, in the 
hope that there will be a firmer basis of support if talks with 
the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] also came to nothing. 
  "We must not reproach ourselves for having stood by and let 
the chance of a compromise escape us at the decisive moment," 
Kok stated. He sees differences in the negotiations which are 
becoming smaller "in their component parts" rather than 
unbridgeable gulfs. "But there are indeed some notable 
differences." 
  VVD leader Bolkestein believes that "results are certainly 
possible" although they are dealing with "very complex matters." 
He states that the process has not yet encountered any "rough 
weather" as D66 leader Van Mierlo had forecast. 
  "The crucial phase the talks have now entered is still going 
to continue for a while yet," Kok believes. Discussions are at 
present concentrating exclusively on social and economic 
affairs, such as employment, spending cuts, social security, and 
tax cuts. 
  The purchasing power of the lower income groups is a crucial 
point for the PvdA. "If we cannot arrive at a balanced 
distribution of incomes, the negotiations will soon be over," 
one PvdA member said. The PvdA is wondering whether any 
agreement is possible on this with Bolkestein. Van Mierlo says 
that "he has detected a VVD readiness to prevent too wide a 
difference in incomes." 
  Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo report that the atmosphere 
at 
the talks is excellent. The politicians, who have been 
appointed by the Crown to assess the feasibility of the various 
coalitions, believe that it will take a few more days before 
stock can be taken of the situation. The impression after the 
first talks is that if agreement is reached on the social and 
economic questions, the other problems will be much easier to 
solve. 
  While the negotiations concentrate on possible cutbacks over 
the next four years, the Lubbers-Kok government still has to 
make up for a financial shortfall of at least 1 million 
guilders. This was caused by the costs of taking in 
asylum-seekers proving higher than estimated while income from 
natural gas remained below forecasts. 
  The spring statement sent by Finance Minister Kok to his 
colleagues contains no new spending cuts, but Kok is asking the 
other Ministries to adopt a "restrained spending policy." Money 
which they save in this way must be used to compensate for the 
deficits.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Special Envoy Yasushi Yasushi Akashi by </F>
Tessa Szyszkowitz; place and date not given: "Do You Like 
Boxing Fights?"] 
  [Text] [Szyszkowitz] Compared with Beirut or Kigali, 
Sarajevo is still lucky in this unfortunate war. Why is the 
United Nations committing itself here, of all countries, with a 
reconstruction plan totaling 6 billion schillings? 
  [Akashi] Sarajevo was a symbol of coexistence between 
nations with different religions and ethnic backgrounds. This 
symbol was destroyed in the last two years with incredible pain. 
It is therefore of particular importance for Europe to 
reconstruct the city. 
  [Szyszkowitz] The central point of the reconstruction plan 
is free access to the city. As long as the roads to Sarajevo 
are blocked by the Serbs, basic materials cannot be supplied. 
  [Akashi] The traffic route from Metkovic on the coast to 
Sarajevo and Tuzla is improving constantly. It is not perfect, 
but there are certain successes. We must rebuild bridges and 
repair roads. If we show the people that peace pays off, they 
will eventually not wish to fight any more. They will exert 
pressure on their leaders to negotiate more seriously. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Are the three warring parties not negotiating 
seriously enough? 
  [Akashi] We will never achieve a solution if every side 
calls for peace on their terms. Everyone wants 100 percent. 
There must be compromises. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Could you imagine that the Bosnian Serbs will 
return 20 percent of the conquered territory? 
  [Akashi] That will be difficult, but I do not rule it out. 
The plan to divide the territory -- 49 percent for the Serbs, 51 
percent for the Muslim-Croat federation -- was developed in 
long, tough negotiations with the three parties. The UN 
delegates believe it is feasible. In the future, the 
negotiations will be on the quality of the territories rather 
than on percentages. 
  [Szyszkowitz] In Mostar last week, Croat women stopped a UN 
relief convoy for Muslim refugees. Do you not think that the 
Muslim-Croat cooperation could fail in reality once again? 
  [Akashi] Is there any federation that has been peaceful from 
the start? Think of the United States, Switzerland, Canada -- 
they are all federations. They were not perfect at the 
beginning. We must give the Muslims and Croats time to win 
confidence in one another. Do not be so pessimistic! 
  [Szyszkowitz] Even if you are optimistic regarding the 
Muslim-Croat friendship -- could not this federation also lead 
to an escalation of war against the common enemy, the Serbs? 
  [Akashi] You could interpret it this way. I hope, however, 
that this federation will be an element of peace in all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Bosnian Government troops are currently 
fighting for the reconquest of territories. Will the political 
leadership be satisfied with 51 percent of the former state 
territory? 
  [Akashi] One needs the spirit of concession and the feeling 
that every side will win more by making peace than by continuing 
the war. Of course, for small territories a war could be 
continued for another 100 years. However, the peoples' 
prosperity depends not only on the size of their countries. 
Germany and Japan are good examples of this. They were reduced 
by World War II and are now richer than they were before the war. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Do you also have such philosophical debates 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic? 
  [Akashi] I am very often philosophical -- with all parties. 
They cannot be convinced easily, but all these talks are useful. 
Do you like boxing fights? I watch them often on television. 
Then I tell myself that, granted, I cannot defeat my opponent, 
but I have staying power. In the twelfth round, it is not I who 
is exhausted, but my opponent. The same holds true for the 
negotiations. We must continue, even though there are no 
prompt, striking successes. The media only report on our 
defeats and setbacks. I already had such a critical world media 
in my last job in Cambodia. However, I won in the end. 
  [Szyszkowitz] You were sharply criticized in the Balkans 
because you were allegedly too pro-Serb. Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic told me a few days ago that he will not speak with you 
any more. How do you negotiate in such a climate? 
  [Akashi] We have all types of contacts. As you have seen in 
our news conference, I do speak with Hasan Muratovic, the 
Bosnian representative on the Sarajevo committee. 
  [Szyszkowitz] Mr. Muratovic apparently wanted to apologize 
to you for his government. 
  [Akashi] Well, the mood has improved a bit. I am trying to 
do my best to remain unbiased. We will never be able to fully 
satisfy everyone. The warring parties must see the necessities 
to which we are subjected. Being an impartial international 
organization, we cannot become the fourth warring party. We 
must be above it. This is of course not always pleasant for the 
people concerned. Some weeks ago, the Serbs did not want to 
talk to us any more, because we called for NATO air raids for 
the liberation of Gorazde. Now we are having a similar problem 
with the Bosnian Government. 
  [Szyszkowitz] The West Europeans are also threatening to 
strike and withdraw their UN soldiers. Granted, during the NATO 
defense ministers' spring meeting in Brussels last week, the 
participants corroborated their commitment. But France, which 
has threatened more vociferously than the others to withdraw its 
troops, is not present at these meetings. 
  [Akashi] To a certain extent, I can understand that the 
French and other governments are frustrated and impatient. 
After all, we cannot stay in the former Yugoslavia for ever. 
There are 16 other UN operations, and we only have limited 
resources. If the parties to the conflict continue to be 
unwilling to make peace, we can only go. I hope the three sides 
see this.

  [Text] Geneva, May 27 (AFP) -- Bosnian refugees might soon 
start to return home, but this is unlikely to herald a mass 
influx of the estimated two million Bosnians displaced by war, a 
UN refugee spokesman said Friday [27 May]. 
  "The Bosnian Government is pushing very hard for the return 
of refugees but it's a question of legal conditions and of 
security conditions in the region," said Peter Schatzer of the 
International Organization for Migrations, a UN agency, at a 
press conference. 
  He said refugee officials wanted to map "safe" regions to 
ensure that repatriated Bosnians were not caught in fighting or 
threatened with reprisal attacks. 
  But Schatzer said certain specific groups, such as highly 
qualified professionals who could help with the reconstruction 
of Sarajevo, might be returned soon. 
  Another group could include some 1,000 Bosnian children who 
were sent to Libya to flee the fighting, but whose parents want 
them home. Schatzer mentioned no specific dates. 
  "We do not yet see the possibility for a massive return of a 
large number of the maybe two million refugees" who fled Bosnia 
during the two years of warfare, the spokesman said. 
  He said that issue would be tackled at a new meeting between 
UN representatives and the Sarajevo government here in June.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today President of the Republic of 
Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova arrived in Oslo, Norway, at the 
invitation of the North Atlantic Assembly to attend its summer 
session. From Oslo, our correspondent Antigona Qena reports: 
  [Qena] On arrival at the Norwegian capital, President of the 
Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova held a series of very 
important meetings at the Norwegian Parliament. He was received 
by Mrs. Tristikoll Drandahl, chairman of the parliament. She 
stressed that this is a rare occasion for her to meet President 
Rugova and receive direct information on the situation in the 
region, which is a preoccupation of the entire European and 
international community. 
  Chairman Rugova briefed the interlocutor on the grave 
situation in Kosova, stressing that it is becoming increasingly 
dangerous and that action by the international community is more 
than necessary. That is why Norway, as a country with experience 
in the diplomacy of prevention and good will, can make a 
contribution in the creation of appropriate circumstances for a 
open dialogue. 
  Mr. Drandahl promised that her country will continue to make 
the situation known and do its utmost in international forums. 
  After this meeting, President Rugova held a long talk in the 
parliament building with representatives of Norwegian political 
parties and nongovernmental organizations, committed to the 
Kosova issue, such as Amnesty International, the Norwegian 
Helsinki Committee, the Foreigners Organization Noah, Redbarna 
Children Association, SOS Racism, the Association of Teachers, 
Presidency of Norwegian Churches, etc. 
  Stressing that he highly assessed the commitment rendered so 
far by the Norwegian Government, political parties, and 
particularly by nongovernmental organizations, Dr. Rugova made a 
general and detailed presentation of the situation in Kosova and 
informed them on the political project on an independent and 
neutral Kosova. 
  President Rugova held a meeting with interest with Mr. 
Hackon 
Glancenburg, chairman of the Foreign Committee of the Norwegian 
Parliament. They stressed the necessity to preserve and develop 
contacts in on official and nongovernmental levels between 
Kosova and Norway. 
  After the meeting at the Norwegian Parliament, President 
Rugova held a news conference, where he answered many questions 
by Norwegian and foreign reporters. The news conference gave 
the impression that since the first day, special attention was 
paid to this visit of the president of the Republic of Kosova. 
  Tomorrow, Rugova will meet Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn 
Tore Godal and other Norwegian officials. He will also address 
the Civil Affairs Committee of the North Atlantic Alliance, at 
whose invitation President Rugova is visiting Oslo.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with OPEC Secretary General Dr. Ahmed </F>
Subroto by Hugo Pedersen in Vienna; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- He knows very well that Norway has 
invested billions in oil production and that we are dependent on 
the income from this money being in some way in proportion. If 
not, investment will decrease and access to new oil will 
disappear. But whether he likes Norway's position is a 
different matter. 
  "We see that the burden of cuts in production is great, for 
Norway too. This is not what OPEC primarily wants, nor do we 
accept responsibility for the fact that the price of oil is low. 
However, we would like to cooperate with oil exporters outside 
OPEC to maintain a stable oil price at a level which is 
acceptable both to producers and consumers," [OPEC Secretary 
General Ahmed] Subroto told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  We met the popular secretary general at OPEC's headquarters 
in Vienna, a little less then a month before he is to leave his 
post. This will happen on 15 June, after six years as head of 
the secretariat. But if the members of OPEC want it, Dr. 
Subroto is ready for another term as secretary general. Next 
week Subroto will visit Stavanager and deliver an address to the 
World Petroleum Conference (WPC 94). 
  "If OPEC wants me to, I would be glad to continue," he said. 
And this decision will be made at the OPEC meeting in Vienna on 
15 June. Both Venezuela and Iran have candidates for the 
secretary general post, but there is every indication that, at 
present, Subroto is the only candidate on whom the 12 member 
nations can agree, even though it could only be for a rather 
short period. The sociable 65-year-old from Indonesia is a 
well-respected secretary general whose qualities as a diplomat 
have greatly helped to keep OPEC together. 
  At a time of record-low oil prices and great internal 
disagreement surrounding the correct methods to adopt, the rest 
of the world has formed the impression that OPEC is in the grip 
of its worst crisis. 
  "The question being asked is how to define the word 
`crisis.' 
It is no crisis for OPEC that we are unable to control the price 
of oil. We want a stable oil price and see nothing to be gained 
from the price swinging out of control. It is only those active 
on the commodities markets who make money out of such swings. 
Today OPEC is the only organization in the world which 
coordinates member nations' energy policy. We try to make sure 
of a stable income from oil without setting concrete goals about 
how high the oil price should be. If we look at members' 
incomes and the development of oil prices, there can be no doubt 
that over time income would have been less if OPEC had not 
protected member countries' interests," Subroto said. 
  He definitely believes that the organization has a mission 
and pointed out that OPEC is one of the most reliable suppliers 
of oil, in both the short and long terms. Even during the Gulf 
war, when oil production from the two major member countries 
Iraq and Kuwait disappeared, OPEC succeeded in maintaining oil 
supplies. 
  Iraq's reentry to the oil market will sooner or later be one 
of OPEC's biggest headaches. As soon as UN sanctions against 
Iraq's oil exports are lifted, the organization will be faced 
with a major problem. This will mean that there will be around 
a further 500,000 barrels of oil on the market -- oil for which 
there is no room on today's market. This is great threat to a 
positive price development. 
  "Iraq is a member of OPEC on a par with other members, and 
what we have said is that when the UN sanctions are lifted OPEC 
must meet in order to find room for Iraq's oil, too. With the 
present production ceiling there is no room for Iraq, and either 
the other countries will have to reduce their oil production or 
we will have to find a solution where Iraqi oil production will 
gradually meet increased demand on a world basis," he said. 
  Even though Subroto talks warmly about stable oil prices, 
there are countries among OPEC members who always want to force 
up prices as high as possible. The price hawks, represented by 
countries like Libya, Algeria, and Nigeria, want high prices and 
the biggest possible income in the shortest possible time. 
Against them stands the largest OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, with 
oil reserves which will last for 130 years to come. This 
country takes a longer-term view and wants a price that remains 
as calm as possible. The Saudi Arabians dominate OPEC, and as a 
rule Oil Minister Hisham Nazir gets things the way King Fahd has 
told him they should be. However, there is no getting away from 
the fact that the low prices of the last few years have put 
great pressure on the OPEC countries' budgets which are 
dominated currently by high foreign debt. 
  "The budget cuts will go on, in 1994 too, even though so far 
the price of oil has increased by $3 per barrel. We do not know 
what the future will bring. Even though there are positive 
signs, our production quota of 24.5 million barrels of oil a day 
will be adhered to," Subroto said. 
  Nor is he worried by Saudi Arabia's dominant role in the 
organization. 
  "In OPEC we have lived with each other for 34 years, and we 
will probably be able to continue to live together. Also, it is 
not only in OPEC that we see the mixture of small and big. Just 
look at the OECD. The problems are the same," Subroto said. 
  The development of oil prices in recent years has been 
worrying, and the markets fear that the price rise of the last 
few months will tempt OPEC to exceed its production quotas 
again. For it is OPEC which is being given the glory for the 
price increase, thanks to the fact that member countries have 
finally shown some discipline with regard to the quotas. But 
OPEC still has spare capacity -- probably around 3 million 
barrels a day -- which could ruin oil prices completely. 
  In this situation is it often Dr. Subroto's silken diplomacy 
which saves the day when member countries' individual interests 
upset negotiations. 
  "I am not sure how much of a diplomat I actually am, but I 
often have to be the link between the parties which difficulties 
talking to each other at OPEC negotiations. Once arguments and 
problems have been explained to the parties involved, and there 
has been a new exchange of views, things normally resolve 
themselves for the best for all parties." 
  Subroto is also the man who has to tackle a baying corps of 
press and analysts at every OPEC meeting. He does so on the 
whole with charm and humor, even though his role as information 
provider can often be hopeless. In the oil industry every piece 
of news has an effect on prices, and the battle to get hold of 
news which could affect oil prices goes to extremes. It has 
actually happened that during extremely difficult negotiations 
with no great measure of agreement Subroto has had to open a 
press conference with the words: "I have nothing to tell you; 
have you any questions?" 
  Oil price movements also attract those who play the markets 
who, according to Subroto, are the only ones who make money from 
the fact that oil prices move up and down dramatically. He is 
worried by the power of the markets over the price of oil. The 
speculators are chiefly active in the unpredictable futures 
market, precisely because of the movement and the chance of a 
profit. Subroto believes that the spot market will take over a 
larger share of the trade in oil -- something which will reduce 
the influence on prices of the paper markets. 
  "The markets do not care whether the price of oil is high or 
low, as long as it goes up and down. We will probably have to 
live with these speculators, but a stable and a more predictable 
market would limit their influence." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Finlay Marshall, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Queen and Prime Minister today welcomed the 
announcement that South Africa is to rejoin the Commonwealth 
tomorrow -- after an absence of 33 years. 
  The Foreign Office described the decision as "a gold letter 
day for the Commonwealth and for South Africa." 
  The Queen sent a message of congratulation to South African 
President Nelson Mandela immediately the announcement was made, 
and John Major sent best wishes from the Government. 
  South Africa's official return to the 50-nation community 
was 
announced in London by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka 
Anyaoku, who told a news conference: "It is with a special sense 
of joy that I announce that South Africa will from tomorrow 
return to full Commonwealth membership after a break of 33 
years." 
  Mr Mandela said immediately after South Africa's recent 
general election that he would be seeking the country's 
re-admittance to the Commonwealth, which it quit in 1961 amid 
international criticism of apartheid. 
  The Foreign Office said it was hoped that South African 
athletes would take part in the Commonwealth Games in Canada in 
August, and that it looked forward to its contribution within

<F P=106> ["IS"-signed report: "Sudan in Vienna `Successful'"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- At a press conference in Vienna on 
Tuesday [31 May], Sudanese President 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir, who 
met with Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni in Muerzsteg 
over the weekend [28-29 May] at the invitation of Austrian 
President Thomas Klestil, stated that the talks had been 
successful. 
  The goal was to improve relations between the two 
neighboring 
countries. This has certainly been achieved. 
  Concerning the civil war between the Islam-dominated north 
and the Christian minority in the south of Sudan, which has been 
smoldering since 1955 and broke out again in 1983, the Muslim 
head of state said that the government has brought large parts 
of the southern regions under its control. Only in some border 
areas is there still some fighting. 
  The fact that the leadership in Khartoum is serious about 
pacifying the country is shown by the acceptance of the 
recommendations that were given in the course of the large 
conference in 1989, such as a "just distribution of power," as 
well as the "establishment of a federal system" into the 
government program. Thus, there are also representatives of the 
Christian minority among the cabinet members and high-ranking 
officers. 
  The junta chief rejected accusations that the Christian 
minority is being suppressed massively as a "negative campaign 
in international media" against the "image of Sudan."

  [Text] Chancellor Vranitzky has guaranteed that no nuclear 
power plant will be put into operation in Austria in the event 
of its entry into the European Union. Vranitzky told ORF 
[Austrian Radio and Television] that Austrian policy is very 
clear. It was laid down in a joint statement that the 
production of nuclear energy is always based on the political 
decision of the country in question. According to Vranitzky, 
the same applies to the disposal of nuclear waste. Therefore 
Austrian politicians are responsible here. For Vranitzky, these 
are clear guidelines.

<F P=106> [APA report: "Domestic Exports to Germany Have Increased"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- The recovery of the German economy is also 
having a favorable effect on Austrian foreign trade. During the 
first quarter of 1994 domestic exports to Germany rose by 2.2 
percent compared with the previous year, imports went up by 6.9 
percent. In 1993 Austria's exports to Germany experienced the 
sharpest decline since the end of the war: Compared with 1992 
they declined by 6.1 percent to 182.25 billion Austrian 
schillings [AS]. Imports from Germany declined by 8 percent to 
AS234.2 billion, according to Guenther Graf, the trade 
commissioner in Germany. 
  The recovery of the German economy could be seen already at 
the end of last year; however, its full effect will probably 
only be felt in 1995, Graf estimates. Austria's membership in 
the European Union will help to benefit from this recovery. 
  The exports of foodstuffs and beverages in particular will 
benefit from the opening up of the market. Austrian producers 
are very interested in the German market and are supported by 
the Chamber of Commerce with a concerted action program. 
  In 1993 foodstuffs and beverages were the only groups of 
products that experienced an increase despite the general 
decline in exports to Germany. The recovery of the German 
automobile industry also gives hope for an improvement to 
Austrian subcontractors.

<F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Claes Defends Rwanda Policy Before </F>
Indifferent Parliament"] 
  [Text] Yesterday Minister Claes of the SP [Flemish 
Socialist Party] replied at length to questions on Belgium's 
policy on Rwanda before the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs 
Committee. The number of MP's present in the chamber could at 
times be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
  The debate on Rwanda was conducted entirely in Dutch -- with 
the exception of one unintentionally absurd intervention by 
Jean-Pierre de Clippele of the PRL [French-speaking Liberal 
Party]. He argued for a geographic separation of Hutus and 
Tutsis -- who share the same language and culture and who have 
lived together for centuries -- "naturally allowing for the 
maintenance of a form of central authority in Kigali, to manage 
the railways for example." A Rwandan observer in the press 
gallery gulped in disbelief: railways in the land of a thousand 
hills? 
  Shortly after the evacuation of foreigners from Rwanda, DE 
MORGEN was able to report -- on the authority of a member of the 
government -- that cooperation in the field between French and 
Belgian paratroopers was faltering. This was accompanied by 
political differences of opinion: The French supported/support 
the Hutu extremists who took over the government. The Belgians 
are keeping their distance from the so-called interim government 
-- which is slandering the Belgians -- and also the RPF [Rwanda 
Patriotic Front] rebels. 
  Magda Aelvoet of AGALEV [Alternative Lifestyle] wanted to 
know from Claes whether our report was right. "Pure invention," 
Claes replied without flinching, "on the contrary, we must 
thank Paris for the help they provided. I have no knowledge of 
French paratroopers refusing to rescue even one of our fellow 
countrymen. People should refrain from spreading such rumors 
and present concrete facts." 
  Aelvoet, followed by Marc Van Peel of the CVP [Flemish 
Christian Democratic Party], then denounced the UN for not doing 
enough to stop the bloodshed. She also argued that Belgium too 
is keeping its head down. A misconception, stated Claes: "It 
would be difficult for Belgium to take the lead: The 
anti-Belgian campaign extends to the refugee camps." But that 
is not stopping Belgium from trying to set up a regional peace 
conference -- "and in this connection I must refute any 
suggestion that we would oppose the presence of Zaire at such a 
conference. Quite the opposite in fact, although we do not 
believe that Zaire can play a leading role due to the major 
transfer of weapons and ammunition from Zaire to Rwandan 
troops." In any event, Claes does not consider any large-scale 
UN intervention in Kigali to be realistic. Belgium continues to 
support "the spirit of Arusha" based on national reconciliation, 
respect for human rights, and democratization. And Belgium is 
already providing several hundred million francs in aid. "We 
remain prepared to contribute to the reconstruction of the 
country and to relieving the enormous human needs." 
  A final subject of dispute was Belgium's visa policy. 
Belgian embassies in neighboring countries are only granting 
visas to Rwandan refugees who can establish that they have close 
links with Belgium, while other countries are being more 
generous, stated Aelvoet. "Be careful," replied Claes, "our 
embassies obviously take the necessary precautions in order to 
prevent those responsible for the killings from finding refuge 
in our country." 
  Aelvoet remained unconvinced. The minister: "And of course 
our embassies also consider where these refugees could go when 
they arrive here, without having to immediately turn to welfare."

<F P=106> [Report by Olivier Alsteens: "Toward a European Nuclear </F>
Deterrent?"] 
  [Text] On Thursday 16 June, the Western European Union 
[WEU] Assembly will examine the report presented by [Belgian MP] 
Armand De Decker on the role and future of nuclear weapons. 
This document was adopted unanimously by the Defense Committee 
-- including, the author stresses, by the French. 
  The document was a long time in coming, taking the Liberal 
deputy to Washington, Moscow, Paris, and London. One of its 
main conclusions is to invite the WEU to create a strategic 
study group charged with eventually setting up a true European 
nuclear deterrent policy. 
  Armand De Decker says that in Washington he witnessed "a 
veritable cultural revolution in the nuclear domain." It is 
true that the Americans have considerably revised their 
positions since the end of the Cold War -- "now they have pulled 
all their nuclear weapons out of Europe with the exception of 
700 small airborne bombs whose significance is more symbolic 
than military." De Decker attributes this shift in direction to 
the absolute supremacy that the United States has acquired in 
the field of conventional warfare. 
  In Moscow, on the other hand, the nuclear issue appears to 
be 
returning in force. The document continues: "It seems to us to 
be less and less likely that the Russian Parliament will ratify 
the Start II agreements. The Russian military world is today 
much more independent and dominant than it was during the 
Communist era." Moreover, since the Russian authorities can no 
longer base their supremacy on conventional weapons, they appear 
to be taking an interest in the nuclear domain: "They justified 
this by stressing the threat that China will pose in the 21st 
century. A nuclear China therefore has indirect repercussions 
on security in Europe." 
  De Decker accepts his previous mistake by revising his 
critical positions with regard to the Partnership for Peace 
being proposed to the Russians: "The United States was right. 
We must go along with Russia and increase our exchanges on the 
political level, civil servants, students, etc." 
  To establish a real European nuclear deterrent, it is vital 
to be able to count on the two European powers that already 
possess a nuclear strike capacity, namely France and Great 
Britain. The British view appears to be clear enough: Their 
nuclear force is integrated into NATO's resources with the aim 
of "defending the vital interests of Great Britain." This 
definition also covers Britain's allies. 
  On the French side, things are less clear. The idea of vital 
interests has never been precisely defined. "However," De 
Decker continues, "the doctrine inherited from General de Gaulle 
proved itself to be the most reasonable. France never took part 
in the arms race. When the Russians and Americans were talking 
of limited response, the French stuck to the policy of a final 
warning followed by a massive response. That is the most 
credible deterrent." 
  Could France agree to abandon sovereignty over its nuclear 
arsenal? De Decker assures us: "The question cannot be couched 
in those terms. Things will be done gradually, not overnight. 
For example, we could start by setting up a nuclear planning 
group based on the NATO model. The Americans always retained 
the final say on when their missiles were to be used, even if 
they were carried on Belgian, Dutch, Turkish, or Italian planes." 
  Armand De Decker optimistically claimed he was convinced 
that 
if General de Gaulle were president of France today, "he would 
be very much in favor of a European nuclear deterrent." The 
situation has changed considerably since de Gaulle initiated the 
French nuclear doctrine, he said: "Today France has its nuclear 
weaponry and Great Britain is involved in the process of 
European integration. De Gaulle would today defend the 
importance and autonomy of Europe." De Decker moreover sees in 
this the reason why the Russians and the Americans are now 
fighting for a ban on nuclear testing: "It is to prevent Europe 
from designing its own weapons system and thus to respond to a 
threat that could come from the East, the Middle East, or North 
Africa."

<F P=106> [Report by Veerle Janssens and Jean-Pierre Schoukens: </F>
"Ministers Put an End to Brabant -- Trade Unions Have Mixed 
Feelings About Division of Property"] 
  [Text] The minister-presidents and some other ministers 
from just about all of Belgium's many governments sealed the 
partition of the province of Brabant yesterday with the 
signature of the cooperation agreement. In July last year, the 
day after the approval of the St. Michael's Agreement, 
negotiations started on dividing the 5,031 staff, the buildings, 
works of art, other possessions, and debts. The inheritors are 
the new provinces of Flemish and Walloon Brabant, the federal 
government, the Brussels Region, and the three Brussels 
Community Committees. The agreement was only fully completed 
last week. 
  Louis Tobback, the federal government's home affairs 
minister, said the agreement was in time to be ready by 1 
January 1995, as planned. Tobback said yesterday he was pleased 
that, despite the sometimes hard negotiations, things never came 
down to a trial of strength. 
  The Home Affairs Ministry said that even the trade unions, 
which recently mobilized staff for the maintenance of their 
language bonus and favorable pension scheme, supported the 
agreement. Yesterday Paul Scherens [Catholic Union of Civil 
Servants] strongly denied the claim. 
  The trade unions remain vigilant. "The cabinet has assured 
us that a law will be passed to ensure that the pensions never 
fall below the level which would have applied had the province 
continued to exist. First we want to see this law passed. If 
it does not come through then we will mobilize again and we will 
also once again raise our demands about maintaining the language 
bonus," Scherens warned. 
  This language bonus will eventually be abolished, according 
to the cooperation agreement. 
  The trade unions lost a court case in which they tried to 
demand negotiations (and not just consultations) about the 
partition's social consequences for staff. The judge said the 
demand was well-founded but could not be received because it was 
"premature." Another case in the Council of State is ongoing. 
The trade unions continue to find it outrageous that as yet 
workers have been given virtually no information about their 
transfer. 
  Now it is a question of waiting for two new governors to be 
appointed. It is they who are to monitor the implementation of 
the cooperation agreement. A bill now put before the senate 
makes it possible for the King to appoint the governors of 
Flemish and Walloon Brabant after the signature of the 
cooperation agreement. Tobback said Parliament could approve the 
law before the summer break. 
  Tobback also indicated that the federal state will pay for 
the construction of two provincial buildings and the 
accommodation of the adminstration. However, this does not 
apply to the official residences of the two provincial 
governors. They will be required to live in their provinces but 
not in the provincial capital. 
<H5>  Uncertainty </H5>
  Delegate Jan Anthoons had mixed feelings about the 
partitioning of Brabant province's property and especially about 
the birth of the new Flemish Brabant province and the 
consequences for staff. 
  The agreement maintains the favorable benefits of the 
present 
personnel conditions. After the New Year no one will earn less 
than now. But the big uncertainty remains where staff will be 
located. So far no one has received even one line of information 
about his or her possible prospects. 
  "The agreement is good for staff remuneration, but 
nevertheless there is a threat of personal dramas for some 
staff," Anthoons said. For example, the province's partition 
means the end of the Medical Social Institute (MSI) in Brussels. 
The MSI will not go into Brussels' hands, as has happened with 
other provincial institutions in Brussels. The new province 
will have to relocate these workers, but this does not seem so 
self-evident. 
  Financially the agreement is unfavorable for the new Flemish 
Brabant province. "The new Flemish Brabant province must take 
over 190 staff too many," Anthoons said. "The present unitary 
province employs more Dutch-speakers than French-speakers, who 
had greater difficulties with the language examinations. The 
new Flemish Brabant province has a surplus in staff because the 
reasonable distributive formula per language was applied 
separately, rather than to the staff as a whole. The budget 
will come under heavy pressure from the wage bill, 
accommodation, and working costs. Figures from the accounting 
department show that the division of the Flemish Brabant budget 
produces a 0.5 billion Belgian francs bonus, but the surplus 
staff numbers reduce this to some tens of millions of francs. 
This situation is burdening the new province's room to 
maneuver."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Eric Meyer: "China Shows the Full Measure of </F>
Its Strength"] 
  [Text] A page of history in relations between China and the 
West was perhaps turned yesterday when President Clinton 
announced the unilateral, unconditional and definitive extension 
of the most favored nation or "MFN" clause. 
  This is also a measure of China's newly acquired strength -- 
and what a distance it has travelled since June '89 when its 
government was the pariah among nations. Although the decision 
to renew this clause was taken some months ago -- rumors on this 
issue were too loud to mean anything else -- it also seemed 
probable that the White House would limit the effect of this 
clause for the benefit of China, allowing it to reap the lion's 
share of a bilateral trade worth 32 billion dollars in 1993. 
  Last year Bill Clinton even stated that in 1994 MFN status 
would only be granted in return for specific improvements in the 
human rights situation. 
  The very least that can be said is that such improvements 
are 
far from evident. The government has released the half dozen 
most famous dissidents (such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan) and 
has refrained from locking them up again when they have made 
statements or had meetings of which they disapprove. And that 
is about it. At the same time, other arrests are continuing 
throughout the country, in Tibet, and in the major cities. Most 
significantly, the police blanket is weighing more heavily than 
ever on those who are considered suspect, the foreign press 
included. Eavesdropping on telephone conversations, 
surveillance, pressure, and warnings are all part of everyday 
life -- this very day a number of Asian journalists had their 
residence permits withdrawn and were escorted to the airport. 
The reasons for this "soft expulsion" are not known. 
  Close negotiations continued for several months, interrupted 
by mutual visits, as if the White House were asking China 
whether it would accept the "proposed" sanctions and Beijing 
just was not interested. 
  Last Thursday [26 May] this same ambiguity was still to be 
found. It was learned from the White House that the clause 
would be renewed, but in order to save face Bill Clinton would 
set up a "human rights secretariat" headed by his predecessor 
Jimmy Carter and charged -- without having any actual powers -- 
with monitoring the situation in China. And then, immediately 
afterwards, a very confident Chinese spokesman informed the 
press that China "would accept no condition attached to its 
(sic) status as most favorable nation" and "also rejects the 
proposal for a joint committee to look at human rights problems 
together." 
  The message was relayed from Beijing to Washington and these 
cosmetic concessions disappeared: Clinton purely and simply 
gave in. But why? First of all, although China sells much more 
to the United States than it buys from it, the products it does 
buy are vital to the survival of U.S. high-tech companies -- 
companies which are in competition with Europe, such as Boeing, 
China's leading civil aviation supplier. Beijing, in the 
position of arbiter, can count on a powerful industrial lobby to 
defend its interest in the United States and in Europe. 
  China and the United States are also "competing" on the 
important matter of stability in the Far East. With many 
interests in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, 
Clinton feels that good relations with China as a growing power 
are necessary to maintain its influence in the region. 
  Finally, initial reactions by dissidents to the announcement 
of the MFN clause renewal show differences depending on whether 
they are speaking from China or from abroad. Li Lu, a prominent 
leader during the Beijing spring who is now exiled in the United 
States, says he is discouraged and disappointed by the news. 
The same opinion is shared by professor Wang Lizhi, also living 
in exile. But inside the country, dissidents can be heard who 
welcome the abandoning of any economic pressure. Such as Mrs. 
Ding Ziling, a teacher, who feels that pressure of this kind has 
been ineffective. Her views are all the more surprising when you 
consider that her own son died under a hail of soldiers' bullets 
during the night of 3 June 1989. But we must not deceive 
ourselves, there are others in China who deplore the U.S. 
retreat. It is just that they are not now in a position to 
speak out -- such as the most famous of all the dissidents, Wei 
Jingsheng, a notable opponent of the clause renewal.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Van Thijn Resigns Following in </F>
Footsteps of Hirsch Ballin -- Possible Comeback by Van Thijn"] 
  [Excerpt] The chances of Interior Minister Van Thijn, who 
resigned on Friday [27 May], returning in the new government 
have not yet declined completely. "I am in no way ruling out 
the possibility of calling upon Van Thijn," said PvdA [Labor 
Party] Leader Kok. 
  On Friday, both Van Thijn (PvdA) and Justice Minister Hirsch 
Ballin, his CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] colleague, 
announced their resignation from the government. The vacant 
posts will be filled by Kosto, secretary of state for Justice, 
and by De Graaf-Nauta, secretary of state for Interior. 
  On Thursday, the Second Chamber forbade the so-called police 
ministers Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn from dealing with the 
Inter-Regional Investigative Teams (IRT's) aimed at combating 
organized crime. Immediately after the second debate in the 
Chamber on the sudden decomposition of the Utrecht/North Holland 
IRT, Hirsch Ballin -- who is a rising political star within the 
CDA -- came to the conclusion that the Chamber was excessively 
restricting him from performing his duties. 
  Hirsch Ballin announced his resignation at the cabinet 
meeting on Friday morning. In the afternoon, after the cabinet 
meeting, Van Thijn followed with his decision to resign. Van 
Thijn maintains that he was not forced to resign by the cabinet. 
After the political commotion concerning his position, "to be 
quite honest it would be hard to justify my staying on," said 
Van Thijn at a press conference in The Hague. 
  According to Prime Minister Lubbers, the departure of both 
members of his government is "tragic, both for them and for 
their cabinet colleagues." The departure of the two ministers 
from the Lubbers-Kok government responsible for "police affairs" 
brings the total of resignations from this government to five. 
  Lubbers denied that his political reputation, and hence his 
chance of securing the presidency of the European Commission, 
has suffered from this. The departure of Hirsch Ballin and Van 
Thijn "is not an affair, but an example of a specific manner of 
behavior between Parliament and the government. This is the way 
things should always be," said the prime minister. 
  PvdA leader Kok underlined that he had "strongly" advised 
both Hirsch Ballin and Van Thijn against resigning. The motion 
adopted by the Second Chamber "did not force them," he said. 
For that reason, Kok has no objection to a comeback by Van 
Thijn, who took office in January of this year. "The events of 
the past few days were not necessary as such," he said. 
  Van Thijn described his brief period in office at the 
Ministry of the Interior as "bizarre." Approximately two months 
after he took office, he was confronted by an extremely critical 
Second Chamber following the sudden decision made at the 
Amsterdam police and justice forum to cancel the IRT for Utrecht 
and North Holland. Only in a second debate last week did the 
Chamber accept a motion in which the two ministers were blamed 
for the failure of the IRT experiment. 
  Van Thijn has not yet made any statement regarding his 
political future. He said: "I have really not thought about it 
at all. First I must recover from the confusion and emotion of 
recent days." Unlike Hirsch Ballin, Van Thijn is not a member of 
the newly formed Second Chamber. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Chances of `Purple' Coalition </F>
Enhanced After Ministers' Resignation"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- The chances of a "purple" coalition of 
the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] have increased now that the 
ministers of justice and the interior have resigned and the VVD 
has emerged unscathed from its first confrontation with its 
party members. Last weekend, the three main players in the 
negotiations, the party leaders Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein (VVD), 
and Van Mierlo (D66) said they were optimistic about the 
possibility of forming a government together. 
  Last weekend, during the general meeting of the members of 
his party in Breda, VVD leader Bolkestein had to justify the 
attempt to work together with the party's former "archenemy," 
the PvdA. However, the letter by F. van der Vorm, a member of 
the VVD branch in The Hague, which was full of concern regarding 
the dangers of a "purple" coalition, did not send the slightest 
ripple through the party. Previously, F. van der Form had made 
a name for himself as the initiator of a an action collecting 
signatures for the return to national politics of prominent VVD 
politician Wiegel. 
  The atmosphere was excellent, primarily because of the 
nine-seat victory scored by the liberals on 3 May, but also 
because word was going around that the three intended coalition 
partners were doing well in the opinion polls, at the cost of 
the CDA, which has suffered further losses following the 
elections. To loud applause, Bolkestein pointed out to his 
members that at the end of the 1980's the VVD had unanimously 
adopted the "Unbroken Lines" report which stated that the 
liberals did not a priori rule out cooperation with any party. 
  The VVD leader also reminded his party members of his slogan 
from the last four years: "No blockades, no flirting." "If we 
now say we are not available, then we will actually cause a 
blockade," said Bolkestein. 
  At the same time, he assured members of the VVD by promising 
that their party would not bargain its viewpoints away. "The 
days when the PvdA had 27 seats more than us are over. Now 
there are only six seats between us. This means that no party 
whatsoever can ignore what we have to say. We will not sign any 
government pact in which our three main concerns have not 
clearly been taken into consideration: substantial easing of 
the fiscal burden, modernization of the social security system, 
and extensive reorganization. We did not enter into the 
negotiations merely with the intention of watching from the 
sidelines. Have no fear: We were not born yesterday, and we 
are looking after all your interests." 
  On Saturday, at the launch of his party's European election 
campaign, PvdA leader Kok also had positive words to spare for 
the "purple" coalition. "Step by step we are coming closer. 
There is a real chance that it will succeed," he said. Kok also 
pleaded to maintain the momentum of the process. The PvdA 
leader and finance minister believes it is important that the 
new government be able to draw up the 1995 budget. To enable 
this, the government must be sworn in by mid-July at the latest. 
  D66 leader Van Mierlo, whose party also launched its 
European 
election campaign last Saturday, is of the opinion that the 
resignation last Friday of the two police ministers Hirsch 
Ballin of the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] and Van Thijn of 
the PvdA could have a positive effect on the coalition 
negotiations. Already back in April, in the first debate in the 
Second Chamber on the decomposition of the Inter-Regional 
Investigative Team, D66 and the VVD had called for the 
resignation of the two government ministers responsible for the 
proposal. Van Mierlo said: "The Lubbers III government is 
finished, and that will certainly not work against the purple 
coalition. Indeed, I regard it rather as a shove in the right 
direction."

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams tonight spelled out 
what he insists is necessary for peace and political progress in 
Ireland: 

  -  Any internal Northern Ireland political settlement 
was out; 
  -  Long-term prisoners should be speedily freed; 
  -  And the 
Unionist veto should be kicked out. 

  He repeated that the clarification of the Downing Street 
Declaration recently provided by the British Government would 
not be examined until after the European elections. But he gave 
a shopping list of requirements at odds with the contents of the 
Declaration signed last December by the British and Irish 
premiers. 
  He said Sinn Fein would have to ensure that there was no 
return to Unionist domination. "There can never again be an 
internal settlement," he added. 
  The British Government should "write into new legislation" 
the right of the Irish people to national self-determination, he 
said in west Belfast. At the same time, the Government should 
legislate away provisions which provided Unionists with a veto 
over political and constitutional change. 
  And he said that the "speedy release of all long-term 
prisoners, pending a full amnesty for all political prisoners, 
must be a matter of urgent concern." 
  The Irish language should be given equality of status, 
including funding, he added. 
  An effort should be made to end job discrimination and 
economic inequalities against Catholics -- and what he called 
the underlying sectarian bias against Nationalist areas in the 
allocation of economic investment must end. 
  Mr Adams appeared to see no contradiction in calling for the 
Nationalist majority in Ireland to be given the right to decide 
the future at the same time as saying the Unionist majority in 
Northern Ireland should lose the right to say what happened. 
And he said: "The British Government must recognise that it 
cannot on the one hand assert its neutrality and say it is for 
no particular pre-determined outcome, while at the same time 
saying it will stand by the Union." 
  His comments came hours after Democratic Unionist MP for 
Belfast East Peter Robinson warned that Unionist people felt so 
alieniated, marginalised and estranged by discussions over their 
head about their future that support for the use of violence was 
increasing.

  [Text] Sinn Fein face indefinite political isolation if 
they fail to grasp the historic opportunity for peace in 
Ireland, Irish deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said today. 
  The clarification Sinn Fein had been seeking of the Downing 
Street declaration on peace in Ulster had been given and they 
must now make their decision, said Mr Spring. 
  "The time for debate, clarification and for equivocation has 
ended. Now it's time to sit down and make progress to end the 
conflict in this country." 
  Mr Spring said the Irish Government had been working for a 
number of weeks to put forward a framework document about future 
peace talks. "We want everybody as part of the democratic 
process. Both the Irish and British Governments have worked 
very hard at bringing the paramilitaries on both sides away from 
the violence. They have to make their decisions. The 
governments want to move on and we hope that the other parties 
will move with us. I would say to the Unionist and Nationalist 
leaderships that there is an opportunity to establish peace on 
this island now. That opportunity must be embraced by all 
sides." 
  He added: "If Sinn Fein or others associated with violence 
do 
not grasp the opportunity that is there now, they are going to 
be isolated and they are going to face a long time in isolation 
if they are not part of the democratic process." 
  Asked if he could see Unionists sitting around the same 
table 
as Sinn Fein, Mr Spring said: "If the people in this country 
have an interest in solving the problem, then they should all be 
sitting at the table. Obviously, there are certain requirements 
and a cessation of violence is one and that has to precede 
anything that happens." 
  Mr Spring was speaking to reporters in Londonderry as he 
made 
his way to County Donegal for the Euroelection campaign.

communications specialists to Rwanda. Defense Minister David 
Collenette says their deployment depends on the United Nations 
supplying 5,500 peacekeeping troops. Mr. Collenette says the 
Canadian soldiers stationed in Kingston, Ontario, have been

a few Canadians are now stationed with the UN force in Rwanda, 
including the group's commander, Major General Romeo Dallaire.

The decision follows a report from Canadian observers that said 
last month's multiracial general election was fair and free. It 
ended decades of white minority rule. The secretary of state 
for Latin America and Africa, Christine Stewart, says this means 
Ottawa can now lift the embargo on government-to-government aid. 
Canada was a world leader in imposing sanctions against the 
white minority government to end apartheid.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Subsidies for Eastern Mafia?"] </F>
  [Text] Ten fish trawlers are irritating Bonn. They are to 
be built by the Peene shipyard in Wolgast for the Russian Ohodsk 
Fishing Company, which moved to the tax paradise of Limassol, 
Cyprus. Bonn wants to subsidize the order volume of 200 million 
German marks [DM] with DM11.85 million. Mecklenburg-Western 
Pomerania is to contribute the same amount; negotiations are 
currently going on. The deal would secure 500 shipyard jobs for 
about two years. 
  However, "in this way we are financing Russian tax 
refugees," 
a confidant of Economics Minister Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party 
of Germany) stated critically. Officials in the ministry are 
currently examining whether money from the Russian mafia is 
being laundered in the deal. The fishing company, which already 
has 26 fishing ships, belongs to Russians who apparently want to 
circumvent the high taxes in their homeland. 
  Johannes Ludewig, head of the Department for Economics and 
Finances in the Chancellor's Office, arranged the deal during 
Russian President Yeltsin's visit to Kohl. Nobody knows why 
Yeltsin supported the Ohodsk group so much. However, there is 
another snag to the deal: Schwerin wants to wait for Brussels' 
agreement to the contract before it forks out subsidies -- and 
it is not certain because the amount of the subsidies exceeds 
the permitted European Union framework of 9 percent.

<F P=106> ["fdo" report: "Lack of Money Makes Scientists' Work More </F>
Difficult"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28-29 May -- The Federal Government wants to 
expand cooperation with Russia in the field of research. Bernd 
Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state 
secretary in the Research Ministry, said that cooperation 
projects in research and development are profitable for both 
sides. 
  Neumann announced that during his government talks, which 
will begin in Moscow on Monday [30 May], three new technical 
agreements are to be concluded on water and environmental 
research as well as on biotechnology. In addition, the final 
discussion about an agreement on ocean and polar research is 
planned. Particularly in the fields of space flight, ocean and 
polar research, and laser technology Russian scientists have 
large know-how. An outstanding example for successful 
cooperation in space flight is the joint development with Japan 
of the "Express" retrievable space capsule. 
  At the international level, Germany is involved in the 
International Economic and Technology Center in Moscow, which 
was founded at the initiative of the German foreign minister and 
the U.S. secretary of state. The institute is to open up new 
opportunities of employment to Russian scientists, who have so 
far worked in weapons development. The international 
association for the promotion of cooperation with scientists 
form the independent states of the former Soviet Union (INTAS) 
in Brussels, which works in the civilian sector and has the same 
goal, is also supported by Germany beyond its contribution to 
the European Union. 
  At the national level Bonn will spend about 37.5 million 
marks [DM] by the end of 1994 for a science support program, 
which was initiated in 1992. In addition, Russian scientists 
are involved in more than 100 projects for technical programs, 
which are financed by the Research Ministry with DM240 million.

<F P=106> [Report by Ferdos Ferudastan: "FDP Does Not Want To Irritate </F>
Turkey"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 27 May -- The Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] Bundestag Group has not agreed to Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel's (FDP) proposal to send CSCE observers to Turkey 
to study the Kurdish conflict. In an interview with FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU, Ulrich Irmer, the FDP Bundestag Group's foreign 
policy spokesman, said that the call for CSCE observers would 
make the Turks feel they are "to be brought before the judge" 
again. This would irritate Ankara and lessen its willingness to 
negotiate. That is why the Bundestag group has decided against 
a Bundestag motion calling for observers, as had been suggested 
by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. 
  Talking to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU three weeks ago, Kinkel had 
called for CSCE observers to be sent to Turkey. 
  Irmer said that, instead of criticizing [Turkey] "in the 
open 
market" by calling for observers, the Turkish Government should 
be persuaded to change its line toward the Kurds and its human 
rights policy by means of talks within the CSCE and the Council 
of Europe. In such internal talks, the Turkish Government tends 
to show "goodwill and thoughtfulness"; but it "simply does not 
have its own army under control any more." 
  As a result of that, the Kurdish identity of people in 
southeast Turkey is disputed, and they are refused the rights of 
an ethnic minority. Irmer said that the fight against the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK) "is an enormous strain on the 
civilian population." Ankara's attempt at solving the Kurdish 
problem by military means is "unsuitable." The FDP group's 
foreign policy spokesman does not share Kinkel's view that the 
human rights situation in Turkey has deteriorated. "I do not 
have any indication" of that, Irmer said. The FDP politician 
said that the German delegation might try putting Turkey's 
Kurdish policy on the agenda of the CSCE conference of 
parliamentarians to be held in Vienna in early July.

  [Text] Bonn -- Bundestag deputies must expect to be called 
to Bonn once or twice during the parliament's summer recess in 
July and August. The reason is that additional sessions will be 
necessary to handle the giant agenda that has built up and can 
hardly be tackled after the recess, as the election campaign 
will be in full swing then. Also, the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party]-dominated Bundesrat, which will meet for another two 
sessions before the summer recess, is expected to return several 
important and controversial bills to the Bundestag. 
  Thus, on 10 June the Bundesrat will have to deal with the 
act 
on compensations for victims of the Soviet land reform in 
eastern Germany, and with a package of laws allowing for a more 
effective crime prevention. Both bills were rejected by the SPD 
in the Bundestag. Now it wants to fight them in the Bundesrat. 
The Bundestag will also have to deal with other controversial 
issues, such as the revision of the abortion law, the postal 
reform, and the rebate law, if these laws are to come into force 
before the end of this parliamentary term. 
  Other important proposals are still with the Bundestag and 
Bundesrat mediating committees -- such as the 1994 employment 
promotion law, the law on Trust Agency succession, or the 
insolvency regulations. 
  The Bundestag is planning to deal with the postal reform, 
the 
rebate law, and laws on small joint-stock companies, the mergers 
and reorganization tax act, and the act on the magnetic 
levitation vehicle. In addition, parliament will have to vote 
on the constitutional amendments that were agreed upon by the 
Bundestag and Bundesrat constitutional committees following 
reunification, and it also has to discuss the ratification acts 
on the enlargement of the European Union. Also on the agenda: 
Bundeswehr planning and possible consequences resulting from 
outstanding Federal Constitutional Court rulings on German UN 
missions. 
  The Bundestag will not meet for its next session before 
mid-June. It will then have three weeks left for debates before 
breaking up for the summer recess. And there will only be two 
weeks available for debates in September before the 16 October 
Bundestag elections. One week will be spent on the first 
reading of the 1995 budget, which will then be adopted by the 
new Bundestag. The remaining week is already in the final phase 
of the election campaign. Previous experience has shown that 
that week will only allow the passing of undisputed projects.

  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(FDP) [Free Democratic Party] referred to the devastating 
effects abroad of the right-wing radical excesses in Germany. 
Speaking at the FDP's Research and Scientific Congress entitled 
"Is Germany Sleeping Through Its Own Future?," Kinkel said: 
"Germany has not yet realized what damage these occurrences are 
causing us abroad. Germany is no longer first choice among 
foreign students. Out of 800 Turkish students who had won 
scholarships, 770 have chosen to study either in the United 
States or Great Britain. Only 12 have chosen a German 
university," said Kinkel. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Herbert Weber: "Kohl Catching Up Rapidly"] </F>
  [Text] Six months ago it sounded like the purposeful 
optimism of a potential loser. Confronted with devastating 
opinion polls, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl felt obliged to 
conjure up his own political upswing. Back then, not even his 
friends in his own party expected him to win the 1994 Bundestag 
elections. But the political compass May figures (conducted 
exclusively for FOCUS by Basis Research) make his forecasts look 
like prophesies: The economic outlook is viewed with growing 
optimism, Kohl is catching up with his opponent Rudolf 
Scharping, and for the first time since December 1993, the 
CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] is 
ahead of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in the 
traditional Sunday polls. Kohl's opponent has to make himself 
familiar with the role of loser. 
  Never before have the Germans -- both east and west -- 
viewed 
the general economic situation as positively as they have done 
in May. Although pessimists still outnumber optimists, the 
number of those answering "bad/very bad" to "How do you rate the 
general economic situation?" has decreased since March (March: 
49 percent, April: 43 percent, and May: 38 percent). Optimists 
are experiencing the opposite trend. Their number has been 
going up between January and May (from 15 percent to 23 
percent). This is particularly significant as unemployment (60 
percent), social policy (23 percent), and economic policy (21 
percent) have been considered priorities. 
  With the number of people believing in an upswing 
increasing, 
confidence in the Federal Government and its leadership is 
growing. Only 36 percent currently think that an SPD government 
is competent enough to solve the existing problems, while the 
figure was 43 percent last month. This means that the SPD is 
only 2 percent ahead of the CDU/CSU in terms of economic 
competence. The trend for the Union is clearly an upward one. 
  This also emerges from the Sunday poll. In the data 
projected onto the actual voting behavior on 16 October, the 
CDU/CSU comes out as winner in the political compass for the 
first time. If there were Bundestag elections next Sunday, the 
Bundestag would look like this: CDU/CSU 38 percent, SPD 37 
percent, Alliance 90/Greens 9 percent, FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] 6 percent, PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] 4.5 
percent, Republikaner 3.5 percent, and others 2 percent. 
  Asked for whom they would vote, if the chancellor could be 
elected in a direct vote, voters expressed wide support for 
Helmut Kohl. While the CDU chairman is supported by 38 percent 
(April: 29 percent), Rudolf Scharping has plunged -- from 47 
percent in April to 41 percent in May. In February, the SPD 
chairman was still far ahead of Kohl at 52 percent over 24 
percent. 
  One of the main reasons why the Social Democrat has lost 
ground have been discussions in the SPD on its election campaign 
and the supplementary surcharge. 
  The FDP is the problem child. The liberals are experiencing 
a clear downward trend. They have lost another 0.5 percent over 
April and would only be elected by 6 percent of the voters at 
the moment -- the end of their time in parliament might be near. 
It is doubtful whether the junior coalition partner will be 
able to struggle to its feet again and will continue to tip the 
scales. It does not have any outstanding personalities, and only 
3 percent of those polled consider the FDP competent in the 
traditional field of economic policy. 
  The parties will have to reckon with the PDS. The successor 
party to the GDR's Socialist Unity Party has gained 0.5 percent 
throughout Germany. This is all the more significant as it has 
lost support in eastern Germany (from 15.5 percent to 14 
percent). This means that support in the old laender has seen a 
substantial increase: from 1 percent to 2 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party leader Rudolf </F>
Scharping by Jean-Paul Picaper in Wittlich; date not given: 
"Scharping: `We Want a European Germany'"] 
  [Text] Born in Rhineland-Palatinate, like Helmut 
Kohl, Rudolf Scharping was elected minister-president of this 
German land two years ago. In 1993, he became the leader of the 
Socialist opposition. The tall and youthful 47-year-old SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader now hopes to become 
chancellor after the 16 October parliamentary election. 
  [Picaper] After the presidential election last Monday [23 
May] in Berlin, you said that the liberal party had discredited 
itself by voting massively for Roman Herzog. Helmut Kohl called 
you a "graceless loser...." 
  [Scharping] While the Federal Assembly, which elected the 
president, was entitled to its decision, it did not take into 
account the will of a majority of the population. The liberals 
yielded to the chancellor's appetite for power. This is what I 
criticized, but my criticisms were directed at the Christian 
Democrats and their president, Helmut Kohl. 
  [Picaper] Do you nonetheless accept Roman Herzog as 
president? 
  [Scharping] Of course; this was a democratic decision. Any 
honest democrat will cooperate with the president. 
  [Picaper] You enjoyed a considerable lead over Helmut Kohl 
in opinion polls. Today, he has caught up with you. 
  [Scharping] This does not worry me at all. While the gap 
has been varying, the SPD remains in the lead. I am convinced 
that we will win the European election of 12 June. 
  [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had to wait almost 10 years before he 
became chancellor. Will you wait this long? 
  [Scharping] No. We intend to win the October 1994 
parliamentary election. And the outlook is good. 
  [Picaper] Helmut Kohl had rivals in his own party, in 
particular Franz Josef Strauss. Is Gerhard Schroeder a 
potential rival for you? 
  [Scharping] We were both in the running for the position of 
SPD leader. Gerhard Schroder is a good minister-president in 
Lower Saxony, and we have no problem cooperating. Close 
cooperation between SPD minister-presidents is essential. 
Germany has 16 laender. We participate in the government in 11 
of them, including nine in which we lead the government. 
<H5>  Our NATO Commitments </H5>
  [Picaper] Do you have the full support of SPD members? 
  [Scharping] I was elected party leader by referendum. More 
than half of our 900,000 members actually voted. It was the 
first time in the history of the party that such a procedure was 
used. This demonstrates our commitment to letting citizens shape 
political decisions, both within our party and throughout the 
republic. 
  [Picaper] After the reunification, do you think that 
Germany's political and economic system should have been 
reassessed? 
  [Scharping] German reunification was both an opportunity and 
a challenge. No one disputes Helmut Kohl's merits in achieving 
German unity, and no one will forget the support of our Western 
friends. However, since then, economically and socially, Germany 
has unfortunately been steered in the wrong direction, a selfish 
one, both by the government and the Bundesbank. 
  [Picaper] Over the past 10 years, there have been 
differences within the Socialist International between French 
Socialist Party (PSF) leaders and SPD representatives, among 
other things with respect to European defense. What has become 
of these differences? 
  [Scharping] All my visits to Paris proved to me that the 
strength of our friendship always allows us to achieve a joint 
position. It is essential that we promote growth and job 
creation, research and technology. On these issues, there are 
no disagreements between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard 
on the one hand, and Germany's Social Democrats on the other. 
  There indeed were a few differences between France and 
Germany on foreign policy, including between the French 
Socialists and Germany's Social Democrats. The Elysee Treaty is 
over 30 years old. I consider that now is the time to make an 
evaluation and to identify in an addendum both the issues we 
agree on and future avenues for cooperation. Our friends and 
partners must know that Germany and France work together ever 
more closely on economic, monetary, and financial policy, but 
also on social policy and, I hope, environmental matters. If the 
Paris-Bonn axis thrives, Europe will make progress, and that is 
our common responsibility, which we must take on with commitment 
and passion. 
  [Picaper] A member of France's current government said that 
Europe cannot be built together with the SPD, especially because 
you refuse to take part in non-NATO military operations... 
  [Scharping] I think that Alain Lamassoure [French European 
Affairs minister] was mistaken, at least with regard to 
Germany's Social Democrats. In any case, we had a chat about 
that shortly after his statement. I think one should not meddle 
with internal debates going on in a friendly country. However, 
one may voice one's opinion. Mr. Lamassoure is entitled to his 
opinion, one among many others. 
  After I was elected SPD leader, I chose Paris for my first 
visit abroad, although France can hardly be viewed as a foreign 
country any more. This was because, in my opinion, 
French-German cooperation and friendship are the key to European 
progress. I spoke with many French politicians: [President] 
Francois Mitterrand, [PS Secretary General] Michel Rocard, but 
also [Paris Mayor] Jacques Chirac and [former President] Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing. We have a strong common foundation for 
working together. Whatever government is in power in France or 
Germany, our relationship will remain good. 
<H5>  Cooperation With France </H5>
  [Picaper] And yet, you will not deny that there was and is a 
neutralist and pacifist wing within the SPD.... 
  [Scharping] Among the Social Democrats, among the Left, 
there has always been a pacifist wing. However, that alone does 
not make a state's foreign policy. The Constitutional Court 
will soon issue a ruling on military operations beyond our 
borders. My party has decided that it will honor our NATO and 
UN commitments. We also approved German cooperation with France 
within the WEU [Western European Union] and the Franco-German 
Corps. We approve of it without reservation. We want a 
European Germany, not a German- dominated Europe. 
  [Picaper] If you win the elections, you will have to enter 
into a coalition with the pacifist Greens, since you will not 
have an absolute majority. 
  [Scharping] No. Speaking of foreign policy, at their latest 
conference, the Greens have passed resolutions that are as silly 
as they are flawed, including winding up NATO and suppressing 
the Bundeswehr. This is no way to go about shaping national 
policy, and if that is the policy they want, the Greens will 
find themselves isolated. 
  [Picaper] If you do not want to work with the Greens and 
since you cannot get along with the liberals, all that will be 
left for you to do will be to set up a large coalition with 
Helmut Kohl's CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. 
  [Scharping] This is a prospect I reject. The SPD will be 
the dominant party and will find itself a partner. Until the 
parliamentary election of 16 October, we shall strive to win 
over as many voters as we can. And in the evening of that day, 
the supply of partners will exceed demand. Market economics 
tells us that the greater the supply, the lower the price and 
the easier the negotiation. 
  [Picaper] In your debate with Helmut Kohl in the Bundestag 
on Friday [27 May], you censured him for only talking about the 
European Commission's white paper, but not implementing it. 
  [Scharping] The white paper contains very good suggestions, 
which will remain attached to Jacques Delors' name, and I think 
it is a shame that they are not reflected in the German 
Government's policies. People start having doubts about a 
European economic policy which made over 20 million people 
jobless. 
<H5>  Common Future </H5>
  [Picaper] What will tomorrow's Europe be like: a large 
free-trade zone with over 20 member states, or an integrated 
Europe? 
  [Scharping] The enlargement of the European Union [EU] must 
not be an obstacle to its integration. Some people say that 
taking in Scandinavian countries and Austria will balance the 
EU. There is no truth to this, as it presupposes that there 
currently is some kind of imbalance. Truth is, Europe simply 
needs to be complete, by integrating the Scandinavian countries, 
Austria, and later the Central European countries. 
  Enlargement must not compromise institutional reform, 
either. 
Francois Mitterrand, too, believes that a "multispeed" Europe is 
feasible. It is obvious that France, Germany, and Benelux will 
meet stated objectives in the areas of monetary policy, 
industrial productivity, or financial stability faster than, 
say, by way of example, Greece, or later, Poland, the Czech 
Republic, or Slovakia. 
  [Picaper] What will be Germany's future status within 
Europe: a centrally located country open to all, or a country 
anchored to the West? 
  [Scharping] There must never be any doubt anymore as to 
Germany's integration with Western democracies. Germany is a 
Western country. We neither want to be the center of all things 
nor to revert to the old Axis policies. We are blessed with 
peaceful relations with all of our neighbors. Germany must 
never again be tempted into going it alone in Europe. 
  [Picaper] A few days ago, skinheads and neo-Nazis committed 
racist attacks in Magdeburg. 
  [Scharping] The underlying causes of this phenomenon are 
poor education as well as a lack of vocational training and 
facilities affording them the opportunity to do something 
meaningful with their leisure time. Add to this a growing sense 
of despair. So we must invest in education and free time, not 
only to thwart the progress of extremism, but also to secure our 
common future. 
  [Picaper] You have likened yourself to Bill Clinton. Do you 
think your fortunes will be similar? 
  [Scharping] I believe that pressure for change in Germany 
has been growing. People want government policies to change. 
While Bill Clinton and Rudolf Scharping are different animals, 
they belong to the same generation. This can be an asset.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from new book, Rudolf Scharping, the SPD, </F>
and Power (Chapter 1), by Thomas Leif and Joachim Raschke: 
"The Scharping System--Loyalties Must Be Cultivated: On the Work 
Methods of Rudolf Scharping, Minister-President of 
Rhineland-Palatinate and Chancellor Candidate of the SPD"] 
  [Text] Exactly how does Rudolf Scharping, 
minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, party chairman of 
the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], and chancellor 
candidate, engage in politics? Who advises him and who belongs 
to his closest staff? What does his political style look like? 
In the Rororo Aktuell book Rudolf Scharping, die SPD und 
die Macht [Rudolf Scharping, the SPD, and Power], Thomas 
Leif and Joachim Raschke describe the "system" of government 
between Mainz and Bonn. We document from the first chapter of 
the book that is being presented in Bonn today, Monday, by 
Joschka Fischer and Peter Glotz. 
<H5>  The Scharping System: Knowledge Is Power </H5>
  "It is noteworthy that Rudolf Scharping looks at the trees 
before he expresses himself on the state of the forest. This is 
a special talent, and I know no other person who stores so much 
detailed knowledge and does not thereby lose sight of the main 
idea and the concept." This respectful assessment comes from 
Edgar Meister, former Hesselbach consultant, manager in the BGAG 
[expansion unknown] trade union holding company, and banker and 
subsequently finance minister in Scharping's cabinet. Since the 
end of 1993, Meister has belonged to the Bundesbank board of 
directors. By the way, the other cabinet members likewise have 
more than mere respect for the enormous storage capacity of his 
memory. They often fear Scharping's "weapon of knowledge." 
  Dieter Kretschmer, chairman of the German Federation of 
Trade 
Unions in Rhineland-Palatinate, goes even further: "He scrapes 
the knowledge from your mind," he admits. "Afterwards he knows 
everything down to the last period and comma." Of course he is 
"very late" in deciding and considers everything quite 
thoroughly. When in an important question for the trade 
unions--the shifting of the labor jurisdiction from the Social 
Affairs to the Justice Ministry--Scharping gave in to the 
pressure of the FDP [Free Democratic Party] in the coalition 
talks, and the trade unions lamented that they were not asked, 
Scharping answered tersely: "Why should I? After all I knew 
that you are against it." This was a succinct and clear rebuff 
from the lonesome ruler, who can build on an unusually high 
level of authority. Scharping's squad of ministers has always 
remained loyal to "godfather." As soon as someone departs even a 
little from the prescribed course, he is caught and brought back 
into line. 
  Juergen Zoellner, his friend and science minister, has 
observed a typical work characteristic of Scharping: 
  No one can deny his steadfastness and ability to get things 
done. "In many situations, he gives the impression of being 
single-minded, of concentrating only on a very specific area or 
object, but he thereby takes in all of the surrounding 
circumstances. At these times, his interests and focal points 
often appear unorderly, but then his strategic thinking suddenly 
reveals itself in the end." 
  The pattern of his work techniques cannot be recognized 
"until it is done." "When it is past," Zoellner repeats this 
somewhat mysterious-sounding concept. But the science minister 
assures that "there is no conceited striving by Scharping to 
prove himself in the competence issue." 
  Scharping stresses his competence only when it really seems 
necessary to him. But then--experienced ministers report 
sorrowfully--he can also expose colleagues pitilessly in the 
presence of everyone. 
<H5>  Scharping's Government Office </H5>
  Under Bernhard Vogel, the government office in Mainz was 
more 
of a sedate agency: loyal party soldiers in the ancestral land 
of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] found a quiet living 
here at the end of their careers. The critical signs of a 
decline of the CDU in the late 1980's and early 1990's were not 
even realized here. 
  Scharping misses no opportunity to praise the loyalty of 
these CDU officials. Almost as a sign of his appreciation, he 
continues to entrust Winfried Scheidt with recording the minutes 
of the cabinet meetings. The chief of Central Department 1, an 
old driver of the CDU, knows all the details about the 
government but keeps his silence. Two other department heads 
likewise still come from the old team. Beyond that, the 
so-called SPIEGEL consultants who look after the individual 
ministries are almost without exception "Vogel people." But, 
just as in other laender affected by changes in the government, 
the important department heads were assigned deputies from the 
SPD, who are supposed to guarantee smooth proceedings in the 
government headquarters. The slogan that comes down from the top 
is this: "Establish loyalties in the control centers and do not 
switch people." That leads only to unrest. 
  Dr. Karl-Heinz Klaer, chief of the government office, has 
accomplished his administrative masterpiece with the 
reorganization of Department 4. 
  Klaer, beginning in 1983 as office manager for Willy Brandt 
and subsequently steeled by "four years of penal company under 
Jochen Vogel," has put together the brain-trust for Rudolf 
Scharping here. Together with the department head, Dr. Gerd 
Mielke, an effective team was assembled within two years, one of 
the largest policy departments in the realm of the ministerial 
bureaucracies in the laender. The formula for success: very 
diverse talents from almost all disciplines work hand in hand. 
Also included are two new consultants, who know how the party 
functions internally. Dr. Rainer Frank, formerly deputy business 
manager for the Social Democratic Working Team for Municipal 
Policy (SGK), and Peter Gruessner, consultant for Bundeswehr 
questions in the barracks, know the mainstream of the SPD and 
feed their experiences into Scharping's land politics. Their 
greatest soft spot is for professionally prepared and 
intelligently staged trips of the minister-president to the 
districts. 
  Karl-Heinz Klaer, a cheerful sort from Saar-Rhine, is a 
constant headhunter, Wherever he encounters people whom he 
considers capable in some area, he collects their calling cards. 
So far he has been fortunate in selecting the staff members, 
probably also because he does not let himself be put under the 
pressure of time. Scharping and Klaer are 100-percent adapted to 
each other and can always be reached by each other. The chief of 
the government office manages in the background, keeps a line of 
retreat open for Rudolf Scharping, organizes the circle of state 
secretaries on Monday afternoons, and clears up possible 
conflicts in advance that could possibly disrupt the cabinet on 
Tuesday. To be sure, he pursues his hobby of media politics but 
otherwise avoids the public quite consciously. Klaer "makes 
relatively few outside appointments, reads everything quite 
carefully, does an unbelievable amount of talking with various 
contacts, and takes charge of the communication in the house, 
which is often missing in the immediate surroundings of 
Scharping," according to the internal view. 
  Klaer, who loves detailed and precise notes in his black A5 
"Cri-Cri" books with a red back, enjoys professional respect and 
sympathy: "He never has anyone on his heels," report those 
working for him, who emphasize his team capability and 
single-mindedness. 
  Several of his close staff members sometimes come to lunch 
in 
the office and always convene once a week. Above all, 
appointments are coordinated in the weekly working meetings. 
Besides Klaer and his adviser Martin Stadelmaier (former 
barracks), the minister-president meets together with office 
manager Friedhelm Wollner (likewise Scharping's schoolmate and 
former colleague of Dietrich Sperling), head secretary 
Marie-Luise Fricker (formerly a secretary in the SPD 
parliamentary group), and Heike Raab. Scharping's secretary, a 
former staff member of Ralf Walter, a young member of the 
Bundestag from Rhineland-Palatinate, is truly the "personal" one 
in the team. She is the practical one in the background, 
organizes the correspondence, writes texts, and schedules 
appointments. She thereby maintains an overall view even in 
hectic situations. 
  Scharping's extraordinary capability is based not least on 
the effective help of his staff members. Because Scharping works 
16 hours a day, "one cannot expect more commitment from Rudolf," 
say without qualification all those who work closely with him. 
  Karl-Heinz Klaer, who loves the work in the system, is 
extremely loyal. Both of them, the minister-president and the 
chief of the government office, "tick the same." There is no 
place for frictional losses and no need for kitchen cabinets. 
Klaer fulfills a critical condition to be allowed to work for 
Rudolf Scharping: they have known each other for years. They sat 
together in sociology seminars in Bonn. The present office 
manager Friedhelm Wollner, a very close confidant of Scharping, 
was also with them. 
  Rudolf Scharping had first arranged a job for the man from 
Saarland in 1971 as a reader with Luchterhand. For this he 
utilized his contacts in the aspiring circles of young social 
democrats [Jusos]. The contact became closer when Klaer--lured 
away from the University of Kassel--worked at the SPD 
headquarters beginning in 1983. As early as 1986, Klaer was of 
the opinion that Scharping ought to join the party executive 
board with the support of Willy Brandt but Rudolf Scharping was 
not yet willing to compete against Willi Rothley, one of his 
adversaries within the party and currently a deputy in the 
European Parliament. He was thereby giving himself more time. 
When Klaer took over the important "politics" department in the 
barracks in 1987, he remembered his friend and procured 
"something very nice for Rhineland-Palatinate" in party 
projects. The Saar-Palatinate axis was finally forged in its 
final form during the Berlin party congress in December 1989. 
Many--such as the present office manager Friedhelm Wollner--who 
really work closely with Rudolf Scharping look back on similar 
experiences. Klaer knows the formula: "One must cultivate 
loyalties." Wollner and Klaer are living examples of opposites. 
The one is as busy as a bee routinely managing the daily 
business and sees to it that no mistakes are made--an effective 
gatekeeper, who also takes the initiative in subjects that may 
be important later on. The other basically deals with things in 
the long term and thinks conceptually into the more distant 
future. Scharping gathers around himself the "extremely contrary 
types," can deal well with the conflict configuration, and can 
even make productive use of it. He draws his impulsive strength 
and dynamic force from this tension. 
  Rudolf Scharping grew up as a group politician. He worked 
his 
way up in the SPD of Rhineland-Palatinate as an individual 
combatant with a great deal of perseverance. For this reason, 
his terrain is not primarily the public. It is the party 
committees. This learning experience results in a certain amount 
of resentment against modern forms of political deliberation and 
great speeches and daring concepts drafted on the intellectual 
drawing board. 
  Scharping, who is not yet utilizing the full capacity of his 
staff members, is seen by them as a "diligent, competent, and 
unobtrusive team player," who is "extremely power-conscious," 
however, while thereby always seeking the "rational and 
reasonable decision." In any case, he is "one who can give 
himself time." The minister-president can "kneel into" themes 
and then "draw from a cornucopia of well-processed knowledge." 
The positive assessment of his work style is that he is "no 
martinet" who "takes out his defects on others." 
  It is not an easy matter to advise Scharping, because he 
often knows as much as the advisers themselves. It is even more 
difficult to advise him with respect to his appointment 
calendar, for Scharping tries to deal fairly with all questions. 
But Karl-Heinz Klaer and Friedhelm Wollner have recognized the 
problem and insist that Scharping be spared too many unimportant 
matters. 
  In accordance with his soft spot for groups, Scharping has 
found his own method of political consultation in nonpublic 
circles of experts. At this level of consultation, he 
deliberately organizes intellectual opposition in the debate 
about questions of the future. With respect to the subject of 
"incidental wage costs," for example, he had Professor Walter, 
chief economist of Deutsche Bank, go against the Darmstadt 
economist Bert Ruerup behind closed doors. Ludwig Zachert, chief 
of the BKA [Federal Office of Criminal Investigation], argued 
with the president of the Duesseldorf police about large-scale 
eavesdropping. The deputy Swedish minister for immigration and 
Dieter Oberndoerfer, the liberal-conservative Freiburg political 
scientist, lectured on international streams of immigration. Pro 
and contra positions meet each other in internal conferences on 
"traffic and mobility" or the controversial subject of the 
negative tax/public money. 
  In such circles, where no one "is on stage," Scharping 
always 
follows the same pattern. He brings experts together with the 
important representatives of interests with respect to 
particular subjects and with the ministerial bureaucracy. He 
does not make a big fuss about these meetings but uses them for 
effective internal opinionmaking. Once Scharping, who tends to 
make decisions by himself, has decided on a position, there are 
then just two maxims for action: "decisiveness" and 
"uniformity." This is the "pure pragmatism" that the chancellor 
candidate counts on and swears his staff members to. 
<H5>  Rhineland-Palatinate--Model for Bonn? </H5>
  Scharping has also introduced his Rhineland-Palatinate work 
style in Bonn. In the "barracks," he meets on Mondays in a small 
group with federal business manager Guenther Verheugen; Wolfgang 
Clement, chief of the government office in North 
Rhine-Westphalia; Lafontaine's subordinate Reinhard Klimmt; 
Karl-Heinz Klaer; and, when needed, some department heads in the 
SPD executive board. 
  This circle of his personal advisers preplans the election 
campaign and prestructures the work of the SPD Presidium, for 
what is discussed here is also done. Important discussions are 
moved here first, and to this extent the presidium is 
functionally controlled. 
  When Scharping made Guenter Vergeugen, the former general 
secretary of the FDP, his federal business manager, it was clear 
to him that someone was taking the office who suits him. He is 
no visionary but a professional tradesman, a sober citizen 
rather than a charismatic. Upon taking office, the business 
manager of the SPD, who was also supposed to rise in the 
parliamentary group, wanted to "put the SPD in a position where 
it is worthwhile to take part in the elections." Rudolf 
Scharping could also formulate his self-understanding as a 
"streetcar staff" this way: "In the practice of politics, you 
spend the largest part of your time establishing the 
preconditions that allow you to take political action at all. To 
gain majorities requires the second largest amount of time. The 
time that is then left for you can be used for concepts." 
  The analyst Verheugen praises "the tremendous activity" and 
"unbelievable presence" of Scharping, whose character portrait 
appears different to him than it does to some others: "His real 
qualities are learned only by those who are permitted to work 
with him for a longer time--his self-irony, for example, and his 
tremendously witty, pithy, and funny talent for expressing 
himself, which comes so easily for him." The thing that 
Verheugen most appreciates about his chief, however, is his 
leadership style: "He leads intimately and coordinates closely." 
  Also with the support of Verheugen, who left the SPD 
parliamentary group as parliamentary business manager, Scharping 
was able almost overnight--"with no public spectacle"--to take 
over the "community of independent speakers" [GUS] (Verheugen 
means the SPD parliamentary group). Once again Scharping was 
fortunate. 
  A "power vacuum" had arisen around the rather ineffective 
chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose, which no one was filling. The 
parliamentary group was accustomed, however, "to being led 
strictly. Moreover for the deputies the power in Bonn had never 
been as close as at the time of their (re-) installation in the 
election districts." Scharping took advantage of this 
situation and enthroned himself, with no resistance from Klose, 
the shadow foreign minister, as de facto chairman of the 
parliamentary group. The influence of the party chairman and his 
opportunities to present himself externally were thereby 
expanded and his forces were concentrated. Verheugen loves this 
form of inconspicuous disciplining: the parliamentary group 
"presently perceives the leadership with tight reins as hearty. 
The people sense that self-acquired substance is there." 
  When important appointments are pending in Bonn, Scharping 
spends half the week there, pursues his favorite activities, and 
"carries on talks into the night." With success, for the quiet 
takeover of the parliamentary group was anything but child's 
play. 
  But it is clear to Scharping that the unity cannot last. It 
is no accident that it came to a dispute in the SPD about 
compensation in the question of nursing care insurance, when he 
had to cure a case of the flu at the beginning of March 1994. 
  Conflicts such as this between Rudolf Dressler, the chairman 
of the SPD's Working Association for Employee Questions (AfA), 
who is close to the trade unions, and Oskar Lafontaine, the 
postmodern deregulator, will flare up again and again: in 
pension (cutting) policy, social policy, and, in general, 
finance policy. Scharping's principle of strict limitation of 
expenditures in the event that they take over the government 
collides with greediness in finance policy in the left wing of 
the party. 
<H5>  Profile of Scharping's Program </H5>
  Peculiarities in the biography, learning experiences, 
successes, and failures determine the long-term goals and 
orientations not only of top politicians. The subjective access 
to social-policy formulations of the problem determine the 
program profile of a politician. Hence the theme of political 
scientist Hans Buchheim also applies to Rudolf Scharping: 
  "Ultimately the person orders all the content that he knows 
and all the experiences that he has, not in accordance with 
objective, but rather with personal criteria: in accordance with 
his biography, intentions, concerns, and state of health.... 
Therefore, the overall order of reality present in the 
consciousness of the person is organized not objectively but 
personally." It is also true for Rudolf Scharping that "politics 
is an interaction that serves only to form personal relations, 
namely the definition of the common situation of all members of 
a society.... It is not a matter of what is, but of how what is 
is interpreted." 
  Following this theme, it is illuminating in the 
clarification 
of fundamental positions to measure persons and policies against 
the specific practice rather than against somewhat nebulous 
explanations and nonbinding theoretical papers. 
  A characteristic example of such practice was the strictly 
secret coalition negotiations with the Greens and the FDP in two 
middle-class hotels in Rheingau in the first half of May 1991. 
After initial exploratory talks on 25 April 1991, Scharping, the 
SPD chief, achieved parallel talks with the Greens and the FDP. 
It was a strategically ingenious coup, for until the end he was 
able to leave both partners in the belief that serious 
negotiations were under way with them and the respective other 
party. That produced in both of them a pressure for success that 
could only benefit him and thereby helped him to put through his 
standards for the coalition talks--"a maximum amount of social 
democratic content" and a "maximum amount of dependability," as 
is noted in the confidential minutes of the Greens on the talks. 
  It was thereby clear from the outset for him and the leaders 
of the negotiations for the SPD that the meeting with the Greens 
involved "sham negotiations," as top people in the SPD now admit 
privately. But there are some negotiation leaders of the SPD who 
stubbornly dispute this assessment. They insist that their 
decision situation was open. Scharping negotiated for 70 hours 
with the Greens and produced almost 100 pages of minutes. In the 
end, his list of differences from 14 May 1991 essentially agreed 
with his letter on 29 April, in which he had presented to the 
Greens--in advance--the secret predetermined break points of the 
negotiations in the form of three pages of questions. 
  But at the core it was a matter of the "maximum amount of 
dependability." Parliamentarian Scharping could imagine this 
only with the liberals. The background of the SPD's policy of 
differentiation from the Realo-Greens in Mainz that Scharping 
had practiced even in opposition times was probably that he 
considered the new parliamentary force to be superfluous. His 
statement that "We ourselves are green," is meant quite 
seriously. With the rise of the Greens, which occurred parallel 
to Scharping's political career, the pace of his career was 
first slowed. The habits of most Greens also displease him. He 
also maintains strict distance to Green female politicians such 
as the top-realo Gisela Bill, who possibly could also work in 
the Working Association of Social Democratic Women (AsF), 
because he perceives fundamentalist tendencies in her. Only land 
parliament deputy Manfred Seibel, a printer from Hauenstein near 
Pirmasens, is accepted by the Social Democrats, although he 
frequently represents strongly leftist positions. But in his 
"bourgeois" bearing and in his work style--he likes to read 
files and like Scharping is sometimes brilliant with details--he 
corresponds to the established parliamentary habits of the SPD. 
  In an internal and still unpublished memorandum, the Greens 
have summarized common opposition experiences, the intensive 
coalition negotiations, and the results from two years of 
government by the SPD-FDP. The comments therein on Scharping's 
personality profile cast a glaring green light on the SPD 
politician, who comes from the same generation as the Green 
politicians in the parliamentary group. It is a picture marked 
by lack of understanding and by distance: 
  ``Scharping's stiffness corresponds to his dispassionate way 
of pursuing politics. It is difficult to find deeper convictions 
in him. Accordingly, fundamental statements from him--government 
statements, for example--are colorless and without any vision, 
as boring as the business reports of companies. He very much 
loves the enumeration of specific technical problems and 
possible solutions, as if to demonstrate his competence. The 
derivation of causes and the attempt at a social-policy analysis 
or the corresponding evaluations are not his thing. 
  ``Scharping provides nothing on further reaching problems 
even in Rhineland-Palatinate, such as the development of rural 
areas, the future of agriculture, the distressed viniculture, 
and sick shoe industry, or postal and railroad reform, or he 
just gives prepared ideas from the conservative drawer. When 
Greens present alternative concepts here, one always hear the 
charge of `unrealistic' from Scharping. 
  ``On complex themes such as economic growth as opposed to 
ecology, the exploitation of resources, the problems of carbon 
dioxide, gene technology, unfair world economic order, and 
impoverishment of the Third World, there are no conceptual 
initiatives from Scharping. He either stays with superficial 
phrases, or he prefers to omit such themes entirely. 
  ``Such rather one-dimensional ways of perception qualify 
him, 
on the other hand, to his first nationally observed appearances 
for the SPD when it is a matter of the pragmatic checking off of 
issues with the conservatives--in the compromise on asylum just 
as in the negotiations on the solidarity pact. 
  ``Smug portrayals are highly developed with Scharping. He 
understands the language of rhetoric on problems nearly 
perfectly. Compromises have no reverse side for him. Criticism 
of his politics or person is never justified at all. 
  ``After all of these experiences, it is not very likely that 
Scharping's heart will begin to beat vigorously on the left or 
that he will develop an ecological awareness. 
  ``We must, however, be prepared to see Scharping make some 
surprising leaps in his uncurbed drive for power and that he 
will suddenly take on ecological and social questions. But it is 
more probable that Scharping will seek his chance in the 
cultivation of his conservative image, his `technical 
competence' and his `dependability,' etc.'' 
  Despite this tough criticism, in the final passage one can 
hear what even the Greens admit privately. If the majority 
relations were to point to red-green and not allow any 
alternative government formations, then the chairman of the SPD 
would also work with the Greens for the sake of power. He will 
then use the 70 hours of coalition talks with the Greens in 
Rhineland-Pfalz as a store of experience.

<F P=106> [Interview with Manfred Brunner, chairman of the League of </F>
Free Citizens, by Bettina Baeumlisberger and Herbert Weber; 
place and date not given: "We Are Not a Protest Party"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] Your League of Free Citizens has only been 
among "the also-rans" lately. Instead of the 35 percent at 
which it is aiming, your party is hardly believed to be capable 
of gaining 5 percent. Is the adventure of the League of Free 
Citizens (BfB) already over before it really started? 
  [Brunner] No, the heated stage of the European election 
campaign is only beginning now -- with television and radio 
spots on the planned abolition of the German mark and 20 
meetings with Joerg Haider. We will concentrate on a 
double-digit result. 
  [FOCUS] You are calling for an election that is to serve as 
a lesson. However, protest parties are no longer well received 
by the voters. 
  [Brunner] We are not a protest party. We are a programmatic 
party of determination. We have a concept for Europe that 
develops from the friendly concentration of diversity and 
rejects standardization and egalitarianism. 
  [FOCUS] Proceed on the assumption that you will really get 
into the Strasbourg parliament. What can you change with your 
small team? 
  [Brunner] We are not so few. Recently a meeting of the 
anti-Maastricht parties took place in Paris. They come from 
almost all states of the European Union. We agreed on the 
formation of a parliamentary group. 
  We want to reform the European Parliament from the inside 
and 
push through the ruling of the FRG Constitutional Court that it 
is basically the national parliaments that have to legitimize 
Europe democratically. 
  [FOCUS] The parliament is to be nothing but a debating 
society? Is your objective the abolition of the parliament? 
  [Brunner] One of my first motions will certainly be that the 
European Parliament change its name to "European Assembly." 
  [FOCUS] Do you think that the efforts to grant the 
parliament more legislative powers are wrong? 
  [Brunner] Absolutely. This would only mean the transfer of 
centralism from Brussels to Strasbourg. 
  [FOCUS] Then your first motion in Strasbourg should not be 
the change of its name, but its abolition. 
  [Brunner] The "assembly" can be an important accompanying 
factor for gradual Europeanization. However, one does not need 
special deputies with their own attendance fees, but can 
dispatch its members from the national parliaments. 
  [FOCUS] Your common interests with controversial Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe] politician Haider are causing you 
problems. People left the party. Is the BfB drifting to the 
extreme right? 
  [Brunner] Joerg Haider was presented as a bogeyman in a 
particular smart form of xenophobia. I am deploring that Erwin 
Wickert and Hans Schauer left the party. They did not reproach 
Haider. However, they believe that the polarization is harming 
us. I see it as an advantage. One cannot win elections without 
polarization. 
  [FOCUS] Do you declare yourself for nationalism? 
  [Brunner] I reject nationalism. Nationalism means for me 
that a nation puts its interests above the interests of other 
nations. What I declare myself for is moderate patriotism: Yes 
to Europe, but not against Germany. A politician must be able 
to define national interests. By the way, this is also a 
prerequisite for compromise. In my speech to the British 
Parliament I said that we Germans must increasingly use the 
numerous agreements in substance with British politics. 
  It is bad for Europe and Germany that France and Germany 
first agree alone on results that are presented to Great Britain 
and other states. The German-French friendship has degenerated 
into a policy against Great Britain, although free trade, 
overall Europe, and a gradual growth of Europe are joint 
German-British objectives. 
  [FOCUS] Will the result of the European elections have an 
influence on whether the BfB will run in the Bundestag elections? 
  [Brunner] We will run in the Bundestag elections in any 
case. 
  [FOCUS] ... and in the landtag elections? 
  [Brunner] The respective results of the European elections 
in the laender will give the answer. 
  [FOCUS] How are you financing the election campaign? 
  [Brunner] By donations, above all from the medium-sized 
industry. The big enterprises regard European unification as an 
opportunity to outmaneuver the medium-sized enterprises. The 
promotion policy of the European Community [EC] is only aimed at 
the big ones. The value-added tax clearing requires special tax 
administrations in the enterprises. The new EC liability 
guidelines reverse the burden of proof. Law and tax departments 
and expensive indemnity insurances that only big enterprises can 
afford -- all that is a program that harms medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  [FOCUS] The BfB makes propaganda for itself as a German-mark 
party. Can it really save the German mark -- perhaps together 
with the Christian Social Union [CSU]? 
  [Brunner] The CSU is the anti-German mark party as such. 
Its chairman, Theo Waigel, confirmed the automatism for the 
abolition of the German mark with his signature in Maastricht as 
the FRG finance minister. With my complaint, I forced the FRG 
Constitutional Court's ruling that rejects this automatism.

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Hank: "Respectable, Firmly Rooted, Crisis </F>
Hardened--the Candidate for the DGB Chairmanship--Nobody Doubts 
Schulte's Election Any More"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 17 May--Officially, Dieter Schulte is 
only the Metal Workers Union candidate at this point. 
Officially, Hermann Rappe, the head of the Chemical Workers 
Union, will still be collecting proposals until Whitsun and then 
present Heinz-Werner Meyer's successor to the public. And the 
official vote for the new chairman of the German Trade Union 
Federatiom [DGB] will not take place until 14 June in Berlin. 
  The fact, however, is that no one today doubts that Dieter 
Schulte will be elected DGB chairman--not even Bruno Koebele, 
who heads the Construction Workers Union, the fourth largest 
union in terms of membership. Though he grumbled about the 
"scarcely democratic" nominating process, Koebele hastily added 
that Schulte is an honorable man and that his union, too, would 
support his candidacy. Objections were also raised today by 
Detlef Hensche, the chairman of the Media Employees Union, who 
some days ago had touted Franz-Josef Moellenberg, the head of 
the Food and Restaurant Workers Union, calling him a "left-wing 
pragmatist." The media employees delegate votes, however, do not 
carry much weight, and Hensche himself is something of a DGB 
outsider. 
  Many of the small and mid-sized unions are grumbling now 
because it has been customary to yield the chairmanship of the 
DGB to one of their own to ride herd on the high and mighty. 
Heinz-Werner Meyer came from the Miners Union; Ernst Breit, his 
predecessor, came from the postal workers. To be sure, the metal 
workers who had not elected a chairman since Hans Boeckler, the 
legendary labor leader of the postwar era, had let it be known 
four years ago that it was their turn again. 
  Schulte, who is not too well known even inside union 
circles, 
is holding back for the time being. He will not be making any 
statements regarding himself or his program until after the 
Whitsun holidays. Metal workers leader Zwickel protested all the 
more loudly today as he tried to dispel any suspicion that the 
metal workers' proposal was based on an arrogance of power. 
Critics who voiced this suspicion had added that the metal 
workers were trying to turn their defensive bargaining tactics 
or their defeat in wage negotiations into an organizational 
victory which did not cost much. Zwickel turned this argument 
around by saying that the metal workers' strong commitment to 
the DGB was proof of the fact that his union was willing to do 
its duty. Schulte's election, he said, would turn the DGB into 
an "effective and universally respected employee organization" 
once again, adding in a poetic vein that "a strong tree must 
have strong roots if it is to grow." 
  Schulte is not only familiar with Duesseldorf and the Ruhr 
area; he also represents employee interests on the EU [European 
Union] Coal and Steel Commission. Where a market such as the 
steel market is concerned whose quotas are allocated and 
regulated by Brussels, the Belgian capital is by no means of 
secondary importance. As a member of the administrative 
committee of the Trust Agency, Schulte is also familiar with 
eastern Germany. That is where Rappe got to know Schulte. The 
two hold each other in esteem as pragmatists. Thus it is quite 
likely that not only the metal workers but Rappe himself voiced 
strong support for Schulte. There are those who object to 
Schulte's selection, saying that he does not represent a growth 
industry. But his supporters counter this argument by noting 
that the ecology movement and the Eisenhuettenstadt experience 
to the contrary, notwithstanding Germany, will continue to be a 
major steel producer which will be forced to modernize in the 
face of international competition. 
  In view of the fact that the metal workers have now come out 
in Schulte's favor, that the chemical workers support him, and 
that the public service employees have somewhat grudgingly 
refrained from raising any objections, the majorities at the DGB 
congress are assured, since the 600 delegates include 179 
members of the Metal Workers Union, 110 of the public service 
employees, and 46 of the chemical workers. That already 
represents a majority--which is the very thing construction 
workers chief Koebele feels is undemocratic. He has been arguing 
for a long time that the 16 member unions of the DGB should have 
the same number of votes regardless of their numerical strength. 
But he stands alone in making this proposal; his critics contend 
that this would amount to a return to the old guild system and, 
what is more, that his union would then be constrained to pay as 
much money into the DGB treasury as the metal workers. 
  Rappe informed the other candidates today that they no 
longer 
stand a chance. The only serious contenders who announced their 
candidacy were chariman Arens of the textile workers and Frau 
Engelen-Kefer, the deputy chairperson of the DGB. Engelen-Kefer 
was said to have taken the news "calmly." She probably 
overestimated her chances. Some days ago metal workers chief 
Zwickel already commented on them less than enthusiastically by 
saying "ah well."

  [Text] Northeim -- Neo-Nazis from Lower Saxony are 
recruiting members in Saxony-Anhalt. According to information 
from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in 
Magdeburg, Thorsten Heise, Lower Saxony chairman of the 
right-wing extremist Liberal Workers Party [FAP], is attempting 
to establish "FAP structures" in Saxony-Anhalt. The new center 
of the anticonstitutional party is Wernigerode in the Ostharz, 
said Wolfgang Heidelberg, head of the Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution in Saxony-Anhalt, where the FAP, which has 
between 400 and 600 members throughout Germany, established a 
regional circle of 60 members last week. However, the number of 
supporters appears to be even larger. Nevertheless there is no 
land organization in Saxony-Anhalt yet, but even in this land 
Heise leads FAP as a "provisional chairman." FAP bases itself 
on the 1920 program of the National Socialist German Workers 
Party [NSDAP]. 
  Because of constant violence usually caused by FAP 
supporters, the police are permanently on alert, said Heidelberg. 
  On Saturday [28 May], in Heise's home town of Northeim, 
there 
was a demonstration against FAP staged mainly by numerous groups 
from the autonomous sphere, but also Greens.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Controversy Over Nuclear </F>
Imports"] 
  [Text] The Chancellor's Office wants to permit the Federal 
Intelligence Service (BND) to buy radioactive material on the 
international black market and bring it to Germany for 
examination. 
  After the draft of a working group in the Chancellor's 
Office 
became known within the government, resistance has started to 
come from the Justice Ministry. 
  The objective of the planned increase in power is to be able 
to trace the illegal trade in nuclear material back to the place 
of production and to stop its infiltration into the black market 
network. Since the examination cannot be carried out on the 
spot for reasons involving tactics and measuring techniques, the 
material has to be imported, it is stated. 
  However, the Justice Ministry does not think that the 
situation on the nuclear black market "endangers security" so 
much that the intelligence services have to be employed. In 
Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's ministry it is pointed out 
that, according to the current law, the BND's intervention will 
violate the international agreement on physical protection from 
nuclear material.

<F P=106> ["uhl" report: "The Mistakes That Were Made Are Normal"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- Trust Agency President Birgit Breuel 
expects overall debts of about 275 billion German marks [DM] by 
the end of the year, the official end of her work. Speaking at 
the Bundestag's Trust Agency Investigation Committee, she said 
that gross losses will be DM345 billion, of which DM68 billion 
in revenues must be deducted after the conclusion of 
privatization. 
  So far, 75,000 privatization contracts and 100,000 leases 
have been concluded. By the beginning of the year sales of DM49 
billion had been agreed on, of which a "double-digit 
billion-mark sum" had not yet been received by the Trust Agency. 
During her first appearance at the responsible investigation 
committee, which took about eight hours, the Trust Agency head 
defended the agency's method of privatization and closing down. 
Without any experience and, at the beginning, only "with a law 
as a tool," it was necessary to transform the GDR economy, which 
was generally in need of improvement, into a market economy. 
The mistakes that were made in the process are normal. 
  These mistakes and a number of decisions, which are 
difficult 
to explain to the public, gave rise in the east to the 
accusation that the agency was "ruining everything" and in the 
west that it was "wasting money." However, the Trust Agency has 
always tried to save as many companies and thus as many jobs as 
possible. Through privatization alone, about a quarter of the 4 
million jobs existing in the Trust Agency companies in 1990 were 
preserved. According to Breuel, in many cases it would have been 
easier for the Trust Agency to send companies on to a summary 
execution. However, in the interest of the companies, one 
decided in favor of time- and cost-consuming liquidation "to 
save what could be saved." So far, about 3,200 Trust Agency 
companies have been closed down. The president estimates the 
costs for closing down at DM45 billion and the revenues from 
closing down at DM2 billion. 
  Committee chairman Otto Schily, Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD], doubted the information provided by the Trust 
Agency concerning the preservation of jobs in the course of 
closing down companies. In his view, it was not 30 but less 
than 15 percent of the approximately 200,000 jobs, taken over in 
the course of the proceedings, which have been preserved. On 
the fringe of yesterday's meeting in the Red town hall in 
Berlin, Schily also accused the Federal Government of massively 
hindering the work of the investigation committee. Files are 
released with delay or are blocked entirely. 
<H5>  Impediment of Work </H5>
  Schily thus indirectly commented on the demand of the 
Federal 
Government, which has called on the Federal Constitutional Court 
to reject the SPD group's suit for releasing the minutes of the 
meetings of the Trust Agency Administration Council. In late 
March the SPD had filed a suit, upon initiative by the SPD 
members of the Trust Agency Investigation Committee, in line 
with Article 44 of the constitution, because they see locking up 
the minutes as impeding the work of the committee.

<F P=106> ["-ann"-attributed report: "Jochimsen Worried About </F>
Financial Policy"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 26 May -- The fact that the German 
national economy is overstrained by the state has not changed, 
so that the improvement of the economic development does not 
permit any secure prospects of growth, either. Rather, the high 
deficits in financial policy and the enormous state expenditures 
and tax quotas are putting a lasting strain on recovery. The 
bank loans to the public budgets are still expanding more 
quickly than those to domestic companies and private persons; 
this also inflates the money supply. The unbalanced situation 
of financial policy overstrains monetary policy. "I, too, am 
very worried that this might lead to potential inflation." This 
was said by Professor Dr. Reimut Jochimsen, president of the 
North Rhine-Westphalia Land Central Bank, in discussions with 
journalists. 
  At the same time, Jochimsen expressed the hope that the 
difference between interest rates for short-term and long-term 
loans achieved meanwhile will stimulate the formation of 
monetary capital and will thus dampen the growth of the money 
supply. The opportunity for the discussion was provided by the 
results of the latest Land Central Bank study on the situation 
of in the land's most important industrial branches, which were 
presented and commented by Jochimsen. The poll shows that the 
economic situation in North Rhine-Westphalian industry is 
improving thanks to strong increases in foreign orders and 
stabilized domestic business, which has recently improved 
tremendously. 
<H5>  Only 3 Percent Remain Pessimists </H5>
  Compared with the reference period in 1993, at the lowest 
point of the recession, the volume of orders to companies in the 
processing industry has increased by 2 percent during the first 
quarter of 1994; for the first time since the beginning of the 
downward slide in autumn 1992, the comparison with the previous 
year is positive again. 
  In particular, the mood has changed in the largest German 
land. Only one-third of the polled companies describe the 
current business situation as "bad"; in the two preceding polls 
of autumn and spring 1993 this was stated by about half of the 
companies. The other two-thirds assessed the situation as 
"good" or "satisfactory." Four out of 10 companies expect a 
further improvement in the next six months; only about 3 percent 
expect a further deterioration of the situation. 
<H5>  Steel Boom as in the Past? </H5>
  In particular, the steel industry is experiencing a strong 
upswing, it received one-fifth more orders than a year ago; here 
the sudden recovery of demand in road vehicle construction is 
having an effect. As Jochimsen stressed, steel production has 
almost achieved the level of summer 1992, before the beginning 
of the recession. Price increases are announced and already 
implemented. 
  Following the structural changes, Jochimsen no longer rules 
out that the first bottlenecks in capacity might soon be felt in 
the steel industry. The plans for changes in the European steel 
industry, which failed half way through, can also be interpreted 
in this manner. 
  Since road-vehicle construction, which benefits, among other 
things, from the economic recovery in Great Britain and in the 
United States and from the expensive yen, a key industry of 
German economy is starting to move again, the stimuli should 
soon be felt also in other sectors, Jochimsen added. 
Machine-building is also gradually overcoming its worst crisis 
of the postwar period. The same goes for the electrical 
industry. Here, however, there is still a lack of domestic 
demand. 
<H5>  Consumer Goods Continue in Shadows </H5>
  The consumer-goods industry continues to lie in the shadows, 
where, in particular, the continuing structural problems of the 
textile and clothing industry have an effect, which entails 
constant shifts of production to cheaper foreign locations. 
After a slightly lower output last year, the construction 
sector has moved onto a course of growth again in 1994, driven 
by the boom in housing construction. 
  Because of the usual lagging behind the orders, industrial 
output is gaining speed only gradually. The majority of the 
polled companies does not yet see any reason to declare an end 
to the current programs for cost reduction and restructuring, 
even if there are signs of a change in the way of thinking and 
the current forecasts for unemployment have been revised 
downward. Jochimsen: "Nothing would be more problematic than if 
now a more favorable economic development were misunderstood as 
a structural all-clear signal." 
<H5>  Alliances for Asia </H5>
  A special part of the poll referred to the gradually 
increasing involvement of North Rhine-Westphalian companies in 
the promising markets in eastern and southeastern Asia, where 
the land, together with Baden-Wuerttemberg, is trying to pave 
the way, in the form of the German Industrial and Trade Center 
in Singapore, which was suggested by the Association of German 
Machine-Building Enterprises and is supported by Southwest Land 
Bank and West Land Bank. The companies see great opportunities, 
particularly in China, without overlooking the political and 
economic policy difficulties; in view of the dimension of this 
challenge, market plans and strategic alliances across 
companies, also with foreign partners, are taken into 
consideration, Jochimsen stressed. Among other things, North 
Rhine-Westphalia has started a cooperation initiative with the 
leading Chinese coal province of Shanxi, which is to open up 
more the new fields of business for the mining subcontractors 
represented there.

<F P=106> [Article by Viola Herms Drath: "The Test Case for Clinton's </F>
European Policy Is the Unsolved Bosnian Conflict"] 
  [Text] When President Clinton pays tribute to the veterans 
of World War II half a century after the landing of the allied 
troops in Normandy, he will also be confronted with the basic 
issue of the U.S. commitment in Europe and Washington's notions 
of the Western security policy. When the Allies liberated 
Europe, the U.S. leadership role was as undisputed, as it was in 
the postwar era when the continent was being stabilized. Today, 
the voices that deplore the leadership vacuum of Washington as 
the only superpower left cannot only be heard in the U.S. 
Congress, but also in European capitals. 
  In the past, the leading role played by the United States 
ensured the implementation of a security policy system that 
brought peace but led to the division of Europe. Meanwhile, the 
question is being asked more and more audibly of how U.S. 
interests should be defined, given the Clinton administration's 
declining global commitment and the reorganization of Europe. 
In the context of the offer made to the East European states of 
a Partnership for Peace, not only Russia's role in a 
pan-European peace order is at issue in the United States, but 
also Germany's position. 
  The U.S. President, who during his trip to Europe will visit 
Rome, Paris, London, Oxford, and Cambridge, will undoubtedly 
feel more at ease in places where protest demonstrations against 
the Vietnam War during his university years took place than on 
the battlefield of the veterans. This holds all the more true 
since confidence in Clinton's foreign policy has increasingly 
declined following the failure in Somalia, the zigzag course in 
Bosnia and Haiti, his backing down on human rights in favor of 
trade interests in China, the refusal of India and other nuclear 
threshold countries to support the renewal of the expiring 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and the unsuccessful 
intervention against North Korea's nuclear policy. No more than 
53 percent of Americans are still satisfied with his performance. 
  Clinton continues to place his foreign policy stakes on the 
propagation of democracy, economic progress, and a security 
policy that is adjusted to reality. However, the primacy of 
active multilateralism at the UN level has already lost much of 
its weight. Despite a one-sided Russia policy, in the framework 
of which Washington has mobilized $4.1 billion for Moscow's 
reform programs, the White House has become increasingly aware 
that the relevant basic security and economic policy decisions 
for East Europe will in the future be made on the Bonn-Moscow 
axis to a much larger extent. 
  The real test case for the United States' European policy is 
the unsolved Balkan conflict. It is true that Clinton agreed to 
case-by-case air raids at UN request, but he left no doubt about 
the fact that U.S. troops would not be sent to the war area. 
Even though the early recognition of Croatia by the European 
Union, which had been engineered by Germany, has met with 
considerable criticism, the U.S. Administration is seeing an 
encrusted position in the current situation, which will thwart 
every endeavor by Bonn to bring about a European balance in the 
Balkans. 
  Washington is still divided on Germany's position in Europe 
and the world. If the Federal Government, in the interest of 
consensus, maintains a low profile, it is accused of neglecting 
the alliance's interests. If Bonn assumes a leadership role, 
people will soon speak about the reemergence of hegemonic 
aspirations that are allegedly manifesting themselves in a 
presumed sphere of influence from the Baltics to the 
Mediterranean. 
  Even the Clinton team, which is largely focused at domestic 
policy matters, is beginning to see that the United States 
cannot dodge its leadership obligations in foreign policy. It 
is true that at the NATO summit Clinton corroborated the 
presence of 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe. But, given the 
reserved attitude regarding their mission, it remains an open 
question whether these U.S. forces can be assigned a European 
defense task. 
  What is certain is the fact that U.S. leadership is 
indispensable for solving global problems, just as European 
problems cannot be solved without Germany. Washington's divided 
attitude toward its partner Germany is also reflected by the 
fact that 50 years after D-Day, the victor powers still consider 
it necessary to exclude the former enemy from ceremonies 
intended to mark reconciliation and solidarity. 
  With the argument that there is "no magic formula" for the 
assessment of national interests and no ready solution to many 
regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts, Clinton is seeking to 
stress the difference between the world war generation fighting 
for democracy and freedom and the challenges to policymakers 
today. The U.S. President is still trying to prove his 
leadership claim through steadfastness and efforts to define 
clear goals.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU deals with the German-French 
summit, noting: The spring storms in both countries' relations 
have abated. Nothing is left of the irritations over Germany's 
nonparticipation in the Normandy celebrations, the differences 
on European policy, and the questions about the future path of 
united Germany in Europe. The course of the consultation 
meeting in Alsace has made it clear that both governments will 
unerringly continue their close cooperation for the benefit of 
both countries and for further European construction. This does 
not mean that in the future there will not be any new 
contentious issues, about which brains will be racked in Bonn 
and Paris. However, both are willing to solve such conflicts, 
FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU says. 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG notes: One of the results is the 
decisions to combat xenophobia more systematically than so far. 
The German side praises this as success. However, there are 
silent differences, which are not mentioned in communiques, 
because the French are only moderately enthusiastic about the 
attempt to distribute a problem, which public opinion mainly 
feels to be a German burden, on several shoulders. The European 
Union [EU] presidency, which Germany and France will take over 
for six months each as of 1 July, is to be used to make the EU 
more dynamic. The Germans want to begin with improving Europe's 
competitiveness by, among other things, striving for a reduction 
of ancillary wage costs. Mitterrand, however, has always been 
rather loath of agreeing to something that basically means a 
reduction of social benefits, SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG points out. 
  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE advocates the following view: The 
busy activities that were presented in Mulhouse with a view to 
the double EU presidency, should not cover up the fact that 
European policy is entering a period of calm. The Maastricht 
Treaty has been concluded. France begins to overcome the 
uncertainty, which had affected the politicians in Paris after 
the upheaval in Europe. Whatever Kohl and the 
Mitterrand-Balladur couple intend for their presidency -- the 
Bundestag election campaign here and the competition for 
Mitterrand's succession over there will dominate political 
activities over the next few months, FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE 
summarizes. 
  NEUE ZEIT from Berlin notes: Once again a German-French 
summit has ended in agreement -- surprisingly, one must say, 
because one of the main issues, namely bringing the East 
European states closer to the EU, has so far been considered a 
contentious issue. However, suddenly it seems to have been 
settled, after President Mitterrand has come out in favor of 
expansion to the East without any deductions and compromises. 
In Paris, pragmatism has won out, since there are still many 
years between the yes to acceptance and the actual expansion, 
NEUE ZEIT says.

  [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois 
Mitterrand were due to meet in Mulhouse on Monday 30 and Tuesday 
31 May for the 63d Franco-German summit. This meeting will make 
it possible to prepare for the European Council meeting in Corfu 
on 24 and 25 June, the G-7 summit in Naples on 8 and 9 July, and 
the German and French terms as president of the European Union 
[EU] which will take place in succession from 1 July. Elysee 
[office of the French president] spokesman Jean Musitelli 
confirmed the creation of "a high-level working group which 
would have the task...of ensuring full consultation between our 
two countries." 
  German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel also confirmed that 
Paris and Bonn planned to combine their efforts to make their 
respective presidencies of the EU a success for Europe. "We may 
assume that the major squalls are behind us," Mr. Musitelli 
stressed, referring to the crisis in the European Monetary 
System, the GATT negotiations, and to the "uncertainties linked 
with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and the problems 
of expansion to include four new members." 
  In addition, in an interview published by L'ALSACE and the 
BADISCHES ZEITUNG, Francois Mitterrand explained that he did not 
see "why and how Europe's `center of gravity' should shift 
following the expansion" of the EU: "Look at a map of Europe: 
Germany and France have never been more `central' in every sense 
of the term."

champion in the presidential election? This is not a new 
question. It now takes on a degree of relevance in keeping with 
the concern felt by Socialists worried by the stagnation in the 
opinion polls of the European list headed by their first 
secretary, embarrassed by the clearly announced opposition 
between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard on the Bosnian 
issue. 
  The PSF first secretary's most lukewarm supporters have no 
hesitation in saying that they now only meet "despairing" 
members ready to envisage any solution to overcome "this looming 
disaster." 
<H5>  `Nothing Is Settled' </H5>
  Bernard Tapie's name is no longer mentioned but that of 
Jacques Delors [EU Commission president] still is, with 
popularity ratings to support it, and that of Jack Lang [former 
culture minister], who has kept a very low profile since he has 
occupied seventh place on the Rocard list. "There will be a 
debate in the PSF," they predict. "How could the first 
secretary lead a presidential campaign when he cannot lead a 
European campaign, and fails to create the slightest dynamism? 
With a view to the municipal elections, the main deputies," 
they assert, "will no longer accept the inevitability of 
Rocard's candidacy." 
  Those who most obstinately defend the mayor of 
Conflans-Sainte-Honorine merely detect an entirely 
understandable "perplexity," the consequences of which should 
not be exaggerated. Especially in view of the fact, they add, 
that the removal of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" list proves 
Michel Rocard "correct in practice," although it does not end 
the debate between those who think that the PSF first secretary 
has distanced himself too much from the head of state and those 
who think he was right to defend the solitary position adopted 
by his party on 20 April "as a matter of honor." With 12 days to 
go before the election, they do not want to give up. "Nothing is 
settled," they say, refusing to attach too much importance to 
the latest snapping jaws of "a few old Mitterrandist crocodiles" 
or to the "alarmist reactions of rather uncommitted spectators." 
The official campaign which is starting will, they think, make 
it possible to clarify the choices, to simplify the rules of the 
game. And when some pass harsh judgment on the first television 
debate between Dominique Baudis and Michel Rocard on Sunday, 
they see it as a successful initial confrontation between a 
"politician" and a "man of convictions" who succeeded in 
defending his plan. 
  The others, who are neither fierce opponents nor 
unconditional supporters, prefer to say nothing. By their own 
admission, they feel "trapped." They have chosen to support 
Michel Rocard, and it is too late to change their minds: "Doubt 
has returned but we cannot afford to have a new crisis on our 
hands," they explain. "Whatever the issue, we must handle it 
calmly." This does not prevent them, in the privacy of Rue 
Solferino [PSF headquarters], from deploring this "pointless 
tension" with Francois Mitterrand when the rumors on the 
Elysee's [office of the president] maneuvers in support of 
Bernard Tapie had scarcely died down. Their criticisms do not 
relate to the content of the statements made by the PSF first 
secretary when faced with Bernard-Henri Levy, but to the method 
adopted. Michel Rocard's presence at the Mutualite, where the 
intellectuals booed Francois Mitterrand's name, is not deemed to 
be very clever. "Fabius," one of the former first secretary's 
aides remarked, "has disagreed with Francois Mitterrand twice 
recently -- on Bosnia and on the expansion of the EC -- but has 
done so in an effort to implement party thinking, not trying to 
dissociate himself from the head of state at all costs." In the 
same way as they criticize Michel Rocard for allowing himself to 
be locked into a debate between Mitterrand and the Socialists 
once again, for blurring the "Right-Left divide" on which his 
campaign should be focused, they regret a certain lack of 
pugnacity on the part of the first secretary which cannot help 
the men on his list or Socialist statements. "But at least," 
they point out, "when we have disagreements with Michel Rocard, 
we have the tact not to display them publicly." 
  As is always the case, the criticisms of Michel Rocard are 
inconsistent. The same people who yesterday criticized him for 
following Francois Mitterrand too closely are now accusing him 
of trying to sever the link too suddenly. The same people who 
yesterday were sarcastic about his big bang, now criticize him 
for not now going far enough in this effort to reshape the Left 
and for clinging too much to the Socialist tradition. The same 
people who yesterday urged him to take a more attacking line, 
now despair at seeing him stand out. 
  Reacting to this new assault and to this strategy of 
"blocking," the PSF first secretary says that he is immune to it 
and reaffirms that "nothing" will make him abandon the 
presidential race. It is not so much that he hopes for a 
dazzling score which would, as his entourage hopes, "silence all 
those who are speculating on a defeat." He still has very 
little room to maneuver. 
<H5>  Attraction </H5>
  He knows this and has no illusions, although he thinks that 
the current opinion polls cannot be reliable. On the other 
hand, he thinks that the political scene after the European 
elections will be clarified, with Jean-Pierre Chevenement 
failing to achieve the 5-percent threshold and Bernard Tapie not 
standing up for long in face of his judges. "His opponents will 
then be clearly identified," one of his close advisers said, "it 
will be time for him to join the presidential campaign, to go 
out to meet the French people after completing his term as party 
leader. He will be able to demonstrate his individuality, as he 
has started to do on the Bosnia issue," he added. Not everybody 
shares this optimism. Although they do not fear an all-out 
offensive by the leaders of the former PSF factions after 12 
June, they expect an explosion of uncontrolled initiatives 
against a man who, they say, will not have demonstrated that he 
has real power of attraction.

<F P=106> [Article by Anne-Marie Rocco and Benedicte de Peretti </F>
in Munich: "Siemens Versus Alcatel: The Battle of the Giants"] 
  [Text] On the left, Germany's Siemens, weighing in 
with a turnover of 280 billion French francs [Fr] in 1993. On 
the right, France's Alcatel-Alsthom at Fr156 billion. In energy, 
the railroad industry, and telecommunications, the two groups 
are waging a relentless war where "an eye for an eye" is the 
only rule. But politicians want the two to cooperate, to 
strengthen the Franco-German axis. 
  The meeting hall in this Defense Ministry building in Paris 
is ice-cold. "It's because of the explosion in the 
air-conditioning plant; have you heard about it?" the affable 
Dr. Baumgartl explains. The cool atmosphere hardly disturbs 
this engineer seconded by Simens to participate in one of the 
most sympbolic joint ventures ever undertaken by France and 
Germany: the development of the first European nuclear reactor 
by the millenium. 
  Owned by Siemens and Framatome under a 50-50 partnership, 
the 
joint venture is called Nuclear Power International [preceding 
three words in English] (NPI), and English will be the working 
language for those involved, who share the spirit of 
participating in a technological adventure. "Most of the German 
engineers who came here in 1989, when the project began, have 
applied to extend their contracts," says Dr. Baumgartl. 
  The project is a superb example of Franco-German 
cooperation--but such cooperation itself seems less and less 
popular. Not that there have been any serious technological 
hitches so far. Quite the contrary. Launched initially to feed 
the export market, the project was backed by EDF [French Power 
Company] and most major German power companies. The nuclear 
safety authorities of the two countries are expected to give 
their blessing this June to the start-up of the second phase of 
the project, "which at this point is very well defined, and 
which also resembles many French reactors," notes Jean-Claude 
Leny, Framatome's CEO. The objective for this new phase "is to 
present, within three years, a detailed proposal setting the 
stage for industrialization." 
<H5>  "Give Back" Framatome </H5>
  The real hang-up is elsewhere. It lies--indirectly--in the 
proposed privatization of Framatome, whose "ownership" has been 
in flux in the last 10 years. When he came to the Matignon 
[office of the prime minister], Edouard Balladur promised to 
"give back" the enterprise to Alcatel-Alsthom, which currently 
owns 44 percent of its stock--the rest is owned by EDF, the 
Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and the employees--though for a 
brief period in 1990 it controlled 52 percent. Preparations are 
under way. CEA has designated the Rothschild Financial Company 
as its counsel for the evaluation, while Framatome has picked 
Goldman Sachs. Both sides are waiting now for a green light from 
the Economics Ministry. 
  But what will become of the future Franco-German reactor, if 
Alcatel-Alsthom's CEO brings to fruition the idea that so 
intrigued his predecessors--taking over Framatome to strengthen 
Alsthom's expertise in conventional turbines, enabling it to 
offer turnkey solutions to clients around the world? The 
question is of particularly keen concern to Heinrich von Pierer, 
president and general manager of Siemens, since he it was--as 
head of KWU, the German group's energy division--who had 
negotiated the Framatome-Siemens accord. 
  Why? Because Pierre Suard is the man who has been working 
ceaselessly since 1986 to block the path of the German 
giant...and who has openly admitted as much to all and sundry. 
"Siemens is my enemy," he reportedly said in an interview 
several years ago. All documentation of that quote has 
disappeared, but the Germans believe it is quite authentic. 
Perhaps to justify their remarkable weakness in the French 
market? At any rate, the pragmatic von Pierer continues to 
preach greater cooperation between these two countries, "which 
by the year 2010 will represent less than 2 percent of the world 
population." 
  But French and German marketing teams on the ground are 
battling tooth and nail in the railroad industry, energy, and 
telecommunications. The war extends down to the working level, 
where for example an Alcatel representative in China refused 
even to meet with a Siemens counterpart freshly arrived in the 
country. And all the way up to the level of gigantic projects, 
such as the South Korean TGV [high-speed train] contract which 
Alcatel-Alsthom, after many vicissitudes, finally nailed down on 
18 April. Siemens, as we know, did everything in its power to 
recapture the contract. Pierre Suard, in an interview with ECHOS 
in January, explicitly branded its competitive practices as 
"unfair." The "friendly" rejoinder from Siemens: "Suard will 
have his Korean TGV, but he's going to lose his shirt." If so, 
Siemens will be able to claim a lot of the credit, since it had 
pared down its own bid several times. 
  In Italy, Alcatel and Siemens both coveted Italtel, the 
telephone switching exchange builder which the government was 
trying to privatize. In late March, the balance tipped in favor 
of the German firm. "It has not escaped our notice that this 
decision was taken on the eve of the formation of a new 
government," commented Pierre Suard on 12 April, not without a 
hint of irony, when presenting his company's the profit-and-loss 
statement for 1993. 
  "Alcatel-Alsthom and Siemens are like water and fire," quips 
one high-level French official halffacetiously. "They are the 
two biggest European firms in their fields," notes Christian 
Fayard, head of Siemens in France, so "no one should be 
surprised they are always butting heads." Two colossi whose 
conflicts are becoming increasingly fierce. "Today the battles 
are enormous," says Fayard. "Korea was as hard-fought as 
Trafalgar. The people involved are prisoners of the battles 
they're waging." 
<H5>  Political Blunders </H5>
  The situation is not an easy one to manage for the 
politicians, who see industrial cooperation as a means of 
strengthening a Franco-German axis weakened by 
reunification...and numerous political blunders. This was why 
Gerard Longuet, France's industry minister, went to Munich for 
private talks with Heinrich von Pierer at the end of March. Only 
two close associates accompanied them. On the agenda for 
discussion: 

  -  The railroad industry, where Siemens proposes 
to bury the hatchet, once the dust settles from the Korean 
contract, by launching a cooperative export venture for future 
generations of high-speed trains; 
  -  Telecommunications, where 
Siemens is demanding greater access to the French market; 
  -  The 
computer industry, where Gerard Longuet is looking for new 
European shareholders for Bull; 
  -  Components, where the French 
hope someday to see Siemens join the Franco-Italian 
SGS-Thomson; 
  -  And of course nuclear energy, the most burning 
issue at the moment. 

  With concessions on both sides, is it possible to reach some 
basis for an understanding? 
  The Germans say they are ready. In autumn 1993, Siemens' CEO 
came to Paris in an effort to convince the industry minister to 
endorse a token stock participation for his group in Framatome. 
A gesture which in his eyes would have sealed the Franco-German 
alliance once and for all...and guaranteed Siemens' future in 
the nuclear industry at a time when the market in Germany could 
freeze up, if the Social Democratic opposition, in alliance with 
the Greens, were to come back to power after the October 
elections. Out of the question, said Alcatel-Alsthom's head. So 
the idea was just dropped. "Pierre Suard won't stand for it," 
was the somewhat rueful reaction at the Industry Ministry, where 
officials are beginning to raise serious questions about how to 
balance the interests of French industry against amity with its 
big German neighbor. 
<H5>  Snubbed by Siemens </H5>
  After all, the man who oversaw the privatization of General 
Electricity Company (CGE) and its transformation into today's 
Alcatel-Alsthom, may be doing nothing more than taking his just 
revenge. "Before the ITT-CGE accord, we were more or less 
snubbed by Siemens," recalls a longtime veteran of the former 
CGE. "We were not treated as one of the powerful few." The 
takeover of telecommunications from the American group, which 
had a very large base in Germany, turned things around. Signed 
about the time Pierre Suard was made head of the group in 1986, 
this accord was followed by a long list of acquisitions, some of 
which are still in progress: Most recently, the takeover of the 
submarine division of STC was finalized in February. 
  Siemens has not done nearly as well in the aftermath, 
despite 
several notable takeovers, including the rather unfortunate 
buy-out of Nixdorf, the computer manufacturer. As for 
Alcatel-Alsthom, it has more than doubled in turnover. The 
French group boasts sales of close to Fr160 billion--admittedly 
less than Siemens' Fr280 billion--but is able to do so without 
as much diversification. And in many areas, Alcatel has surged 
ahead of its rival. 
  In all this time, the German firm has watched helpless as 
its 
French competitor advanced by forced marches in most sectors. In 
its own national market: In addition to the ITT deal, Alcatel 
bought out Kabelmetall, while Siemens was prohibited by the 
Office of Cartels from acquiring PKI, a Philips subsidiary that 
also specialized in cable manufacturing. And its proposed 
alliance with AEG in the railroad sector was blocked, at the 
same time that Alsthom succeeded in becoming system coordinator 
for the domestic industry. And in France: Alcatel took over the 
telecommunications division of Thomson in 1983. Four years later 
Siemens failed, for political reasons, to acquire CGCT--an ITT 
subsidiary--which it had hoped would give entree to the French 
telecommunications market. At the time, the German firm's top 
executives were still licking their wounds over the Unidata 
fiasco in the computer domain and the abortive acquisition of 
FAE-Arnould in the electric equipment field. Old scars, 
these...and so deeply etched that only a generational change can 
efface their memory. "Siemens had a policy of external growth in 
France, in telecommunications and energy, that it was unable to 
actualize," Christian Fayard sums up. 
  The figures speak for themselves. Alcatel-Alsthom has annual 
sales of Fr28 billion in Germany, mostly in telecommunications. 
Siemens' sales in France, by contrast, are no more than Fr8 
billion. Active in automotive electronics, lighting, electronic 
components, and measuring equipment, Siemens has but token sales 
in the French telecommunications market. Von Pierer says 
straightforwardly: "I realize it's a delicate and difficult 
issue, and I am a patient man. But the current situation is not 
acceptable indefinitely." 
  What then is Siemens' best hope today for selling telephone 
equipment in France? It is to become the third largest supplier 
for the GSM [global system for mobile communications] 
radiotelephone system--the operator for which will be chosen in 
the coming weeks. A prospect at best uncertain, until 
authorities make known their decision: Alcatel has put in its 
bid against Bouygues and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez! 
  So a new fracture line has appeared between the French and 
German firms. Because Pierre Suard's group has set its sights on 
a new "El Dorado": service, where profit margins are not yet 
paper-thin. Supplying telephone line is going to become less and 
less profitable, as has already been demonstrated on the German 
market. "Since 1990, Deutsche Telekom has begun forcing its 
suppliers to lower prices, by 23 percent last year," notes 
Andre Chassagnol, financial analyst at Safe (Paribas group). A 
move made necessary by plans for privatization of the German 
operator, which explains why the two groups, with worrisome 
synchronicity, have both announced projections of profit 
downturns on the order of 10 to 20 percent for 1994. 
<H5>  Grandiose Dreams </H5>
  For all these reasons, Alcatel wants to graduate from 
manufacturer to operator. In Hungary, it has joined forces with 
US Telecom East (United States) to operate four regional 
telecommunications systems. More spectacularly, it has bought a 
stake in Global Star, a consortium that aspires to create an 
international satellite-based mobile communications network. And 
if information superhighways see the light of day--a development 
which Pierre Suard seems convinced is inevitable--no doubt he 
will get in on that as a supplier...and an operator. Alcatel is 
already experimenting, in Great Britain as well as the United 
States. 
  "Multimedia offers fascinating prospects," the head of 
Alcatel-Alsthom loves to repeat, almost lyrically. To prepare, 
it is getting more and more involved in the graphics domain, for 
example by entering into partnership with a producer to launch a 
tele-purchasing station. Grandiose dreams, some say. But the 
Germans realize that if their enterprise was picked to install a 
telephone system in Vietnam, it was because it promised it too 
would be able to transmit graphics there. 
  The French strategy of bold integration worries its German 
rival. Operating both traditional and multimedia telephone 
networks, Alcatel will be even better positioned to block 
Siemens' path. Will Siemens be forced to move in the same 
direction? Unwillingly, to be sure. At heart a manufacturer, a 
company of engineers if ever there was one, the German group 
prefers to keep to its role as an equipment supplier. What it 
gets enthusiastic about is "intrasectoral" diversification, on 
the Japanese model: Cost what it may, it clings to its 
electronic components and its data processing. Because these two 
domains are in the process of converging with 
telecommunications. And there it will enjoy technological 
independence. 
  It's more than just commercial competition: In reality, the 
two firms represent two strategies, two conflicting visions of 
the world. Is it possible, then, for the two giants to put all 
that aside and cooperate in one specific domain, nuclear energy? 
In its deliberations over the Framatome issue, this is the 
formidable question the government will have to address. Because 
it was on this ground, implicitly, that Pierre Suard took his 
stand on 12 April. "Two questions must be negotiated," he said: 
"the price of the buy-out (of stock held by public-sector 
shareholders), and the industrial policy that Framatome will 
pursue." The heart of the issue, he said, "to put it simply, is 
our cooperation with Siemens." 
  But "there is no question of dismantling the alliance with 
the Germans," Suard protests. Except that Framatome, after 
privatization, "will belong to an industrial group into whose 
strategy it will have to be integrated." A top-level 
Alcatel-Alsthom executive puts it this way: "The Franco-German 
accord must be adapted to the new reality." 
  The Germans are turning somewhat of a deaf ear to such talk, 
while at the same time they deny any intent to interfere in a 
French internal issue. "We are already halfway there," explains 
Adolph Huttl, director of KWU and member of the Siemens board of 
directors. "There is nothing to be changed; either we keep 
going, or we stop." He would of course prefer to continue with 
the cooperative venture, "which in any case was never considered 
a short-term project." 
  In Paris, Jean-Claude Leny is on the same wavelength. He's 
looking out past the year 2000, because that is when the aging 
French nuclear generating stations will have to be replaced. 
"Nuclear energy is much like aviation. No one today would buy a 
Caravelle." The German market itself, while not converting to 
all-nuclear, might still offer some interesting prospects. But 
the real growth potential is in big-ticket exports to countries 
like China, India, Thailand, or Indonesia. Leny cautions, 
though, that competition with the Americans and Japanese will 
get more intense, even within the European Union--where "the 
rules of the game are going to change," he says. Thus he already 
dreams of Europeanizing NPI, "that embryonic nuclear Airbus." 
Great Britain, Belgium, and Spain are reportedly interested. 
  The presumption underlying a consortium like Airbus is that 
it rests on political will. That is certainly the case in the 
nuclear energy field. But there's a problem: What happens when 
one of the partners is about to fall under the control of an 
owner which, though not opposed to the policy, is determined to 
impose its own industrial vision and therefore takes into 
account--reasonably enough, one might add--the dimension of 
competition vis-a-vis the other partner? "It's up to the 
authorities to resolve matters in such a way that a joint 
venture of this scope and duration does not get derailed by 
secondary considerations," avers Jean-Claude Leny, who is ready 
to go to the mat to defend "the continuity of nuclear energy 
with society." At NPI, attitudes oscillate between worry and 
philosophic fatalism: "We're very curious to see how it will all 
turn out." 
<H5>  [Box, p 50] </H5>
<H5>  Von Pierer: Negotiations </H5>
  "We cannot stand idly by as the Americans invade our markets 
while keeping us out of their own," warns Heinrich von Pierer, 
who at the same time denies his aim is "fortress Europe." A 
confirmed liberal, the Siemens CEO is nevertheless understanding 
of the policy pursued by Paris, which rejects "laissez-faire," 
and constantly praises the progress French industry has already 
made. "France and Germany are obligatory partners," he says with 
conviction. The only thing he says he cannot understand is 
France's position on the GATT [General Agreement on Trade and 
Tariffs], its willingness to take such heavy risks "for the 
benefit of agriculture, which represents so little." 
  At heart a frustrated politician, von Pierer might have made 
a career for himself in the CSU, the Christian Social Union that 
rules Bavaria. But in 1976 the party rejected his candidacy for 
the Bundestag elections. Furious, he made Siemens the target of 
his ambitions. But he is still a member of the CSU, and kept his 
seat on the municipal council of his hometown, Erlangen, for 18 
years. 
  A jurist by training, he joined Siemens, the town's largest 
employer, in 1969. As marketing director at Kraftwerk Union 
(KWU), the energy division, his negotiating talents propelled 
him to the board of directors, and he was made its president in 
1989. At the nuclear waste reprocessing center in Wackersdorf, 
which the Bavarian government suddenly abandoned, he succeeded 
in avoiding any labor conflict. So he had a clear path to the 
top. 
  Named vice president of the group in 1991--to the surprise 
of 
almost everyone--he became its CEO a year later, at the age of 
51. His dynamism galvanized the "old lady of Munich." He is 
still moving rapidly, as he did back in the days when this 
former junior champion from Bavaria divided his time between the 
tennis courts, editing the local Erlangen sports journal, and 
university. In 18 months, he has already toured more than a 
hundred subsidiaries all over the world. When the Malaysian 
government asked to see the presidents of the two finalists in 
the competition to build an electric generating station before 
making a final decision, von Pierer was on the ground in Kuala 
Lumpur within 24 hours...and got the contract. The conquest of 
Asian markets is, along with the building of Europe, a constant 
theme with him. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has gotten the message. 
Asia is now the major focus of his economic policy speeches. 
<H5>  [Box, p 51] </H5>
<H5>  Suard: Power </H5>
  He has battled socialism, derided the Maastricht Treaty, 
criticized the Commission in Brussels for the way it treats 
alliances among European industrialists, and raised his voice 
loudly against the recent reform of while-collar retirement 
provisions. Pierre Suard does not hesitate to make waves. The 
recession? It's behind us, Edouard Balladur asserted one evening 
last January on television. Suard, in an interview the following 
day, maintained the contrary. Coincidence? 
  Brought into the office of the presidency on the coattails 
of 
the Chirac-Balladur duo in 1986, Suard today wants to prove he 
does his own thinking. Just as he demonstrated, eight years ago, 
that he was not just a transition CEO. Named head of CGE with a 
mandate to privatize it, he was only the 11th CEO in the 
100-year history of the enterprise. Was he picked because of his 
15 years of in-house experience as head of subsidiaries like 
Cables de Lyon, where he had shown his mettle? Or because of his 
political profile? An RPR [Rally for the Republic party] 
sympathizer, his ties with Balladur go back to the era when 
legendary CEO Ambroise Roux offered the current prime minister 
the presidency of two subsidiaries. Four years later, he pruned, 
restructured, and put his men in important positions: among 
others, Pierre Bilger, former CGE treasurer, who was put in 
charge of Alsthom, and Andre Wettstein, his former top aide at 
Cables de Lyon. By making CGE systematically absorb its most 
lucrative subsidiaries, he transformed the doddering CGE into a 
formidable cash cow. Alcatel-Alsthom was born. And he was its 
first president. 
  This former associate of Michel Debre in the Finance 
Ministry, this mountaineer who prefers his house in Haute-Savoie 
to the ostentation of life in Paris, has become one of the most 
powerful industrial bosses in France. Does the game excite him? 
His rise has had little effect on either his lifestyle or his 
tastes. Admittedly it has its little rewards, such as being able 
to buy the Gruault-Larose chateau, or create a press group built 
around L'EXPRESS, which was part of Ambroise Roux's legacy. But 
he does not spread himself too thin: His top priorities are 
still to control the electric power network--including nuclear 
energy--from top to bottom, and to broaden the group's 
telecommunications base by going into the services side. Two 
objectives whose attainment, ironically enough, is complicated 
by his reputation as a friend of the government. Balladur would 
be open to criticism for showing too much favoritism toward his 
former colleague.

bureaucratic inertia... The excesses of the Haberer era at 
Credit Lyonnais have become a political issue that could 
threaten cohabitation. Most worrisome are the serious 
deficiencies they reveal in the management of France's largest 
bank. 
  It all erupted so suddenly no one saw it coming. More than 
the private school affair, more than the CIP [youth vocational 
training contract] affair, it threatens to become the first 
major crisis of cohabitation, and may even foment divisions 
within the majority itself. The Left saw the dismissal of 
dethroned senior civil servant Jean-Yves Haberer as an attack on 
the Elysee and an implicit swipe at Pierre Beregovoy. Bercy 
[Finance Ministry] and the Treasury Directorate take the episode 
as an infringement on their prerogatives. For them, the worst is 
probably yet to come. The fact that Philippe Seguin is 
personally chairing the parliamentary commission of inquiry is 
probably not unconnected with the fact that Treasury's director 
at the time was Jean-Claude Trichet, now governor of the Bank of 
France and mortal enemy to all opponents of the strong franc 
policy. 
  Even the timetable of the probe is tainted with partisan 
considerations: The inquiry's report is supposed to be submitted 
on 11 September, coincident with the beginning of the final 
stage of the presidential race. Now as "luck" would have it, the 
principal target of the majority deputies is expected to be 
Bernard Tapie--undeclared candidate in the presidential 
elections--by virtue of his controversial ties with SDBO, a 
Lyonnais subsidiary. The rich political trappings of this big 
showdown could divert attention from the most important question 
raised by the affair: How could France's biggest bank have 
adopted such dysfunctional operating procedures? Because there 
was no actual wrongdoing, not in the juridical sense. And the 
alarm was sounded much earlier than people today find it 
convenient to remember. 
  In fact, it all began three years ago, in late 1990, with 
the 
MGM affair. MGM--that glorious and expensive Hollywood 
studio--fell into the portfolio of the French bank almost 
without warning. Concerned at the volume of money involved, the 
Banking Commission asked Lyonnais for all the details on the 
Parretti imbroglio. By dint of increasingly insistent pressure, 
the Banking Commission finally had its way, and the figures 
provided to it at that time turned out to be accurate. It was at 
this point that the bank monitoring body decided, contrary to 
what had been said since, to put Credit Lyonnais under close 
surveillance. This was in autumn 1991 (as confirmed by 
memoranda). What was disturbing was the sharp augmentation of 
Lyonnais's activity (loans out and portfolio participations) at 
a time when the economy as a whole showed obvious signs of 
getting winded--and the bank's accounts looked entirely too good. 
<H5>  Failure To Inform </H5>
  In July 1991, the profit-and-loss statement for the first 
half of the year, though very favorable on its face, confirmed 
the commission's doubts and convinced it to continue 
investigating the bank. 
  It decided to begin by focusing the investigation more on 
the 
subsidiaries than on the parent company. In November 1991 the 
inspectors started with Altus, Jean-Francois Henin's fiefdom. 
That was the focus until April 1992. Their labors bore fruit: 
They demanded specific reforms on provisions, calculation of 
earnings, and accounting practices. A long letter was sent to 
the titular president of Altus, Jean-Yves Haberer, in which the 
inadequacy of internal controls was mentioned. As regulations 
stipulate, he was the only recipient. It was up to him to inform 
the shareholders, to wit Lyonnais and Thomson, and the auditors. 
He did not do so. 
  The second subsidiary on the list was Bernard Tapie's 
generous provider, SDBO, where the mission remained from the end 
of May to September 1992. Then the focus shifted to Clinvest and 
International Bankers, both headed by former Lyonnais president 
Jean-Maxime Leveque. The commission meanwhile wrote again to 
Boulevard des Italiens [Credit Lyonnais headquarters] reminding 
the president of the conditions attached to the 1991 settlement 
of accounts. Once again, the shareholders of Credit Lyonnais 
were not informed officially. At the same time, before the final 
closure of the 1991 accounting year, the governor of the Bank of 
France--Jacques de Larosiere, the president of the Banking 
Commission--hosted a "summit meeting" with Jean-Yves Haberer and 
Francois Gille, the bank's director general. Coincidence? 
Anyway, the net amount for provisions to cover "bad" risks was 
increased 50 percent over the 1990 level. Thanks to Altus, 
Credit Lyonnais still showed a net profit of 3.2 billion francs 
[Fr]. But the situation worsened under the weight of economic 
recession, especially the real estate crisis. 
<H5>  Image-Conscious Auditors </H5>
  After publication of the accounting figures for the first 
half of 1992, the Banking Commission opted to probe into the 
core of the reactor. In October 1992, it would audit the parent 
company. As the tutelary authority for the banking sector, the 
then-economic affairs minister, Michel Sapin, was informed; he 
in turn sent a letter to Jean-Yves Haberer on 22 September 
directing him to furnish a detailed analysis of the bank's loan 
portfolio. A new anomaly: The Banking Commission was unaware of 
the existence of this letter. Apparently, it knew nothing about 
it before it was published recently in the pages of LIBERATION. 
Conversely, Michel Sapin was probably unaware that the Banking 
Commission was already within the gates. In the meantime, 
however, informal contacts were established with the Treasury 
Directorate, which after examining the six-month accounting 
statements, warned the minister's staff. But officially, at the 
political level, no decisions were made. Finally, the 1992 
accounting year ended with a loss of Fr1.8 billion. The picture 
was reportedly "improved" by an accounting artifice--reducing 
the country-risk provisions by Fr2.5 billion--with the 
acquiescence of auditors Ernst &amp; Young and Coopers &amp; 
Lybrands. 
The auditors made no special comments in the final auditors' 
report, despite the violent arguments they had with the office 
of the director general. The excuse made by one of the auditors: 
"We didn't want to destroy the image of the bank, and we 
continue to stand by that position." 
  Dissimulation? Under the law, the auditors have no right to 
pass information to other persons. Lack of judgment? No, because 
at the time they believed, as did the regulatory organism, that 
the bank would be able to solve its problems by itself. Why then 
should they create a furor in Paris financial circles? A 
sentiment with which the Banking Commission would concur, right 
up to May 1993. But when finally it received the report from its 
inspectors, it judged the time opportune to inform the 
shareholders: in this instance, the state. In August 1993, the 
governor of the Bank of France sent a very official letter to 
the minister. The solemn terms employed and the unusual nature 
of this step left little room for doubt: The affair would have 
to be dealt with under Article 52 of the Banking Law of 1984, 
which obliges shareholders to take responsibility for the 
collapse of their institution. The solvency ratio of "the bank 
that always says yes" was at risk of falling below the 8 percent 
level required to meet international banking standards. In his 
letter to the minister, Jacques de Larosiere mentioned a 
Fr7-billion shortfall in parent company provisions. An estimate 
which, according to Jean-Yves Haberer, reportedly was reduced to 
Fr5 billion after heated discussions initiated by Francois 
Gille. Rumors began to circulate quietly here and there, but 
nothing official leaked out. Surveillance of the group resumed, 
as ritually performed as two episodes of "Santa Barbara." The 
Commission inspectors returned to monitor compliance at Altus 
and SDBO, and were upset to see there had been no slowdown in 
activity at Altus, in the first six months under the leadership 
of financial high-flyer Jean-Francois Henin, despite generally 
deteriorating economic conditions. Not surprisingly, the probe 
led back, in November 1993, to the parent company, this time 
under the eye of an observer from the Treasury Directorate. But 
by now it was too late to avoid the political fallout. 
<H5>  Politics and Prestige </H5>
  Several more weeks, and this auditors' headache would become 
an "affair." Ultimately, the Banking Commission was to reckon 
the real loss for 1993 at just over Fr15 billion. But the 
official figure, disclosed on 24 March, was only Fr6.9 billion, 
to which the observers added Fr18.4 billion in state guarantees 
to OIG, the real estate company where Fr40 billion worth of 
Lyonnais' "problem" assets and real estate loans had been 
placed. So now we are up to more than Fr25 billion. Of course, 
that is just an approximation. The guarantee covered only Fr14.4 
billion of dubious real estate credit. The other Fr4 billion was 
for future interest expenses and carrying costs. Is all this 
just bickering among the experts? No, it's more than that. 
  First of all, the amounts of money involved are shocking, 
since they don't even include the three huge scandals the 
Lyonnais carries like millstones around its neck (Maxwell, MGM, 
and Sasea), already in large part funded in 1992). Second, what 
the battle is really about is not so much accounting as image 
and politics. Otherwise why would we have seen so much wrangling 
between high-level bureaucrats who rarely indulge in public 
scenes? These masters of the bureaucratic bromides taught at ENA 
[National Public Administration School] would soon fall into 
dissension. Between the outgoing president, who thought the bank 
could resolve its own problems; the Treasury Directorate, 
outraged by the criticisms leveled at Jean-Pascal Beaufret, 
chief of its office of financial and monetary affairs, manager 
of the bank since 1992; the cabinet of Edmond Alphandery, weakly 
defending the ministry's role; and new Lyonnais president Jean 
Peyrelevade, supported by the Matignon [office of the prime 
minister] but characterized as "cowardly" by his banking 
colleagues. 
  In the last analysis, how much money did Credit Lyonnais 
lose 
in 1993? It all depends how you look at it. When a business 
loses money on a real estate asset, or an ownership interest in 
such an asset, it must recognize the entire loss at once if it 
is forced to sell it in less than a year. On the other hand, if 
the business deems it strategically important to keep, the 
potential loss can be stretched out over two or three years. 
Everything depends on whether management regards it with a 
short- or medium-term perspective. The same goes for loans. By 
way of example, BNP [National Bank of Paris] did not provision a 
single centime for EuroDisney, though it has lost Fr5.3 billion. 
For one simple reason: It believes that the loan is not at risk 
since interest payments continue to be made. 
  "This very often is the explanation for all the changes in 
the accounting picture whenever a new president comes on board. 
In the Lyonnais affair, the judgments made about operations 
already under way suddenly changed," says one of the 
protagonists. From the perspective of his industry-bank 
strategy, Jean-Yves Haberer was fully within his legal rights 
not to recognize the total potential loss, since from the 
standpoint of his objectives it was a long-term investment. 
Today, it is obvious that Jean Peyrelevade views the situation 
in terms of a definitive clean-up of accounts that will free his 
hands for the future. As shown in the real estate loans. At the 
height of the crisis, to prevent banks from being dragged down 
with their developer clients an ad hoc agreement was negotiated 
with the tutelary authorities: Treasury, the Banking Commission, 
the association of chartered accountants, etc. Written 
directives were sent to allow real estate provisions to be 
stretched over several years. "But the new Lyonnais management 
decided to set aside all the provisions at once," notes one of 
the company's directors. 
  What if the financial position of the OIG real estate 
company 
were to improve dramatically tomorrow--what would be the 
judgment then? That Catherine Tron, the expert into whose hands 
its management was entrusted, performed brilliantly? That the 
financial arrangements put together by the Banking Commission, 
Treasury, and the bank were astute? Or simply that the crisis is 
over? "If it hadn't been for the recession, everyone would have 
said it was a work of genius," a critic of Jean-Yves Haberer 
readily admits. 
  That, in any case, is the line of defense taken by the 
former 
president of Credit Lyonnais. But that defense cannot excuse the 
company's managerial errors. It is not enough to have a grand 
strategy: One must also mind the store. And Jean-Yves Haberer 
ran Lyonnais like the Treasury Directorate, without bothering to 
find out what was really happening. Here's one revealing 
example: The Olympia &amp; York case, one of the world's biggest 
real estate disasters. "I learned in the press that we were 
involved; it was not up to me to keep tabs on that, there was a 
system of delegating authority already in place when I arrived, 
and I kept it," says Haberer. "But I asked for an investigation 
to find out how it happened." The bank lost a trifling Fr2 
billion in that Fr70-billion real estate collapse. One fact 
uncovered in the probe was that Bernard Thiollon, then-director 
general, gave a green light, against the company's 
recommendation, to the financing of Canary Warf, the famous 
London real estate project that led to the ruin of the Reichman 
brothers. 
  From the moment he arrived, Jean Peyrelevade put an end to 
the practice of delegating unlimited authority to the 
directors--a practice that does not exist in the other big 
banks--and simultaneously reduced the total of tied-up funds. 
Similarly, he created a directorate of loan commitments staffed 
with four investigators to keep a close eye on the 400 biggest 
clients with which the bank has commitments in excess of Fr100 
million. The criterion? Their ability to pay back their loans 
tomorrow, or at worst within five years. At Societe Generale and 
BNP, there is a prestigious monitoring unit called the 
inspectorate general. It is almost unthinkable that Boulevard 
des Italiens should have nothing comparable. That until 1991 
there were no consolidated statements, client by client, 
developer by developer, and there was no centralized risk 
management. For France's largest bank, truly incredible! This 
awesome mismanagement is at least partly to blame for anomalies 
like the Parretti affair, or the Pelege disaster in the real 
estate domain. 
<H5>  Autonomous Fiefdoms </H5>
  Another explanation of this incredible chaos: the fiefdoms 
that Jean Peyrelevade began denouncing as soon as he took 
office. Within the bank, the largest fiefdoms were in commercial 
banking, the directorates of the big subsidiaries, real estate, 
and international lending. Among the subsidiaries, the most 
notorious were SDBO and Altus, which seem to have been the 
source of about 80 to 90 percent of the losses. Thus Michel 
Gallot, inspector of finances, president of SDBO with almost 
unlimited autonomy, took advantage of his friendship with 
Haberer to circumvent the hierarchy. With the results now 
familiar to everyone. As for Jean-Francois Henin, the "Mozart of 
easy money," he reported directly to the office of the 
president. To complicate matters even further, the two previous 
directors, Jean-Maxime Leveque and Jean Deflassieux, continued 
to cast their own shadow on the company. The first personally 
introduced three of the bank's big clients--including Robert 
Maxwell and Michel Pelege--to his successor. The second 
continued to exert a strong influence on international lending, 
notably to CLBN, the Dutch subsidiary through which the MGM 
scandal arrived. 
  One can certainly see why Jean Peyrelevade is so cool to the 
idea of seeing the parliamentary commission of inquiry take the 
torch from the State Audit Office and make a public spectacle of 
all the tangled and damaging threads to this affair. At this 
level of dysfunction, the bank will require more than provisions 
for bad credit...to undo the moral damage to its own. 
<H5>  [Box, pp 58-59] </H5>
<H5>  Disinvestments </H5>
  The word went out to sell. Jean Peyrelevade's originally 
announced objective--a disinvestment of Fr20 billion--has been 
revised upward now to Fr35 billion over two years, to calm his 
overly-excited colleagues. At every level, in all the 
subsidiaries of Credit Lyonnais: 1,200 industrial 
participations, totaling Fr50 billion, were examined with a 
fine-toothed comb. The simplest transactions were those in the 
orbit of Clinvest, the group's merchant bank. A special unit was 
set up to take charge of unloading shares held in various 
businesses; it was staffed by five of the bank's forty-odd 
employees, under the direction of Henri Filho. Their mission: to 
sell off as many assets as possible. But it proved to be an 
arduous task. First, because the recession and sluggish stock 
market were against them; second, because in most cases Lyonnais 
had been content with minority ownership positions of 10, 15, or 
20 percent, rarely more (only in disastrous situations), to 
avoid the need to consolidate them into its own accounts. 
Moreover, the bank's withdrawal risked leaving the companies 
involved vulnerable to the horrors of investor turmoil, at a 
time when they were only just beginning to recover from the 
economic recession. So the new CEO wrote personal letters to his 
principal clients, to assuage hurt feelings. 
<H5>  In Progress </H5>
  Already Fr2 billion of shares have been transferred, 
including TF1 [television network], the Naf Naf textile group 
which has just gone on the Stock Exchange, and Essilor. These 
disentanglements were carried out quickly and most often 
discreetly. In some cases, as with Sylea, a Labinal subsidiary, 
they were accompanied by financial restructurings. If computer 
chip card maker Gemplus goes on the Stock Exchange, Clinvest 
will also seize the opportunity to reduce its holdings. 
<H5>  Being Considered </H5>
  The temptation is great to disinvest from Marne et 
Champagne, 
one of the biggest champagne wholesalers, weighed down as it is 
with the takeover of Lanson. Likewise the bank on Boulevard des 
Italiens is reportedly tempted to distance itself from the 
Bourgoin company, but the fragility of the country's second 
largest poultry concern makes that operation very sensitive. The 
objective of Henri Filho's team is to find buyers capable of 
reaching an understanding with the majority shareholders. For 
the moment, shares in companies quoted on the secondary market, 
and small enterprises not traded on the Exchange, are proving 
easier to unload. Flo breweries may soon follow in Naf Naf's 
footsteps. 
<H5>  Hoped For </H5>
  The financial situation of some companies such as 
Aerospatiale and Usinor-Sacilor offers little if any hope of a 
rapid and honorable withdrawal, though Credit Lyonnais has quit 
even trying to hide its desire to extricate itself from these 
two groups as soon as possible. As for FNAC, it could change 
owners much sooner than expected. Several prospective buyers 
have signaled their interest. Quite a few, actually: Compagnie 
Generale des Eaux, Pinault-Printemps, Bertelsmann, Kingfisher, 
etc. The complicated dossier of France's biggest bookseller 
could, paradoxically enough, turn out to be the easiest to 
resolve. 
<H5>  Impossible </H5>
  In general, these large transactions are being carried out 
in 
a pragmatic way, taking advantage of opportunities as they 
arise, the ideal being to trade a capital loss for a good exit, 
as in the case of TF1 (Clinvest ceded 3 percent of its shares). 
While partial disinvestments are relatively easy to arrange, 
solutions must still be found for participation in 
control-holding groups such as Artemis (Pinault), Sofitbol 
(Bollore), Arnault et Associes, and Christian Dior (LVMH). The 
resolution of Altus' situation will necessarily entail 
lightening its portfolio, but investments in the controlling 
companies of certain large groups, and in "financial chain" 
entities such as Novalliance, seem to be locked in where they 
are. 
<H5>  Partial Disinvestment </H5>
  While it may be out of the question to withdraw altogether 
from major enterprises such as Bouygues, Lagardere Groupe, etc., 
it is still clear that the bank is looking to reduce its 
equities in other companies. There have been some gradual share 
transfers, notably vis-a-vis Lagardere Groupe. Reduction of its 
external ties has become an obsession, but cessation of 
investment is already a reality. Apart from a very few symbolic 
transactions, the king of industrial banking has decided it does 
not want to buy into any more companies. 
<H5>  [Box, p 60] </H5>
<H5>  Haberer Interviewed </H5>
  [L'EXPANSION] The parliamentary commission of inquiry is 
trying to focus on the dysfunction that supposedly existed in 
the relationship between Lyonnais and the ministerial 
authorities. What is your position? 
  [Haberer] I don't see any "dysfunction" to complain about. A 
public bank lives in very close intimacy with its shareholder, 
the state, and with the Bank of France. Coordination of these 
two entities is not the bank's responsibility. The Treasury 
Directorate did its job. The three successive administrators it 
delegated--Philippe Jaffre, Denis Samuel-Lajeunesse, and 
Jean-Pascal Beaufret--are remarkable men whose critical 
faculties never failed them. France's biggest bank has a 
macroeconomic role. It has an obligation to conduct itself 
responsibly. At the time, France's enterprises were suffering 
from equity capital shortages, so they welcomed the 
industrial-bank strategy. 
  [L'EXPANSION] You are accused of having made decisions in a 
vacuum. 
  [Haberer] This is the classic tactic for dodging 
responsibility--and invoked by the very people that were 
supposed to be setting policy! Credit Lyonnais is a 
statutory-law company. When it comes to extending credits, 
nothing is decided without a committee meeting and official 
minutes. And in a bank that has 8 million clients, it is not the 
president's job to ensure in each case that the collateral is 
sufficient. On the other hand, as soon as I arrived, I set up a 
committee, like the one at Paribas, where capital investments 
were discussed. At all events, the criticisms leveled at me 
should be seen in terms of the big picture. 
  [L'EXPANSION] Why did you invest in Usinor-Sacilor? 
  [Haberer] I wouldn't do it again today. But at the time, 
people were criticizing Lyonnais for only financing financiers. 
This particular idea came from the [Usinor-Sacilor] president, 
Francis Mer, and his enterprise flourished. The deal was also a 
beautiful piece of financial engineering that augmented our 
equity capital, despite the restraints that impeded us.... The 
Cooke ratio gave us no choice! 
  [L'EXPANSION] Some of the bank's losses come from the 
subsidiaries, Altus and SDBO, which you have defended. 
  [Haberer] Their recent reverses have weighed less heavily 
than the provisions required for the commercial bank: the motion 
picture industry, small- and medium-size enterprises, real 
estate. In France, the parent companies, with their monolithic 
traditions, don't have close ties with their subsidiaries. If 
they did, how could they manage to run up a consolidated balance 
of Fr2,000 billion without paralyzing centralization? You have 
to give the subsidiaries their commercial autonomy. Altus made 
more money in four years than it lost, and I regard as unfair 
the sarcastic criticisms directed at Jean-Francois Henin, one of 
our country's best financiers. The SDBO has a long history, an 
entrepreneurial culture, and it works in market niches that 
Lyonnais itself seldom frequents.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Xavier Marchetti: "Meeting for Assessment"] </F>
  [Text] Rotation sometimes works well. For a year, 
beginning 1 July, Germany and then France will shoulder the 
presidency of the European Union [EU] in succession. Statutory 
alternation dictates this. 
  The two countries whose cooperation will have most strongly 
influenced the move toward Europe, despite temporary 
disagreements and fleeting quarrels, will be at the helm in 
turn. And this comes at a difficult time. It is clear that 
this welcome political continuity will either provide Europe 
with a decisive impetus capable of giving it a real economic, 
diplomatic, and even military identity, or the last opportunity 
will be wasted. 
  The ground is fairly clear. The big upheavals are behind us. 
Neither GATT, daunting because of the risks of division it 
involved, especially between Paris and Bonn; nor last summer's 
crisis which almost destroyed the European Monetary System; nor 
the rather stormy ratification of the Maastricht Treaty sufficed 
to block the EU's progress. 
  Once the danger is over, there is always a tendency to 
underestimate it. It nonetheless existed, and it must be 
admitted that, without Franco-German cooperation, it would 
probably have ended in disaster. It is this cooperation which 
Francois Mitterrand, Edouard Balladur, and Chancellor Kohl are 
discussing in Mulhouse. 
  But this [Franco-German] summit will be more one of 
assessment than decisionmaking. Indeed, the aim is to prepare 
for the European Council meeting in Corfu at the end of June, at 
which Jacques Delors' successor as head of the EU Commission 
will be appointed, and the G-7 meeting in Naples at the 
beginning of July. The first is an internal affair focused 
largely on the running of the EU institutions. The other is an 
external matter within the club of the most highly 
industrialized countries and involves the establishment of 
better conditions for economic development through the inclusion 
of a "social clause" [in trade agreements]. This is a full 
enough program to justify the Mulhouse consultations. 
  In view of the preelection debate on the renewal of the 
European Parliament, such a summit may seem to be a routine 
matter. This would be to forget that European building has only 
been able to progress thanks to compromise and that there is no 
other means of progressing. 
  Nothing better illustrates this obvious fact than 
Franco-German cooperation. Without it, Europe would already be 
a dead idea.

  [Text] The Prime Minister [Cavaco Silva] sent a verbal 
protest to the Philippine Government in connection with the 
expulsion of Portuguese representatives at the Manila conference 
on East Timor. This is the first government reaction to events 
involving the controversial conference under way in the 
Philippines. 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] A few days ago the Portuguese 
Government presented a verbal note to the Philippine Government 
protesting the fact that visas were not granted to Portuguese 
people, including Portuguese deputies, enabling them to 
participate in the Manila conference. At the same time the 
Portuguese Government expresses its surprise at the fact that a 
country we consider to be friendly has bowed to pressure from a 
dictatorship -- the Indonesian dictatorship. 
  We expressed our surprise, our apprehension at the fact that 
obstacles were placed in the way of Portuguese citizens and 
foreign citizens who wanted to participate in the Manila 
conference. [end recording]

Carrascalao of UDT [Timorese Democratic Union] said a few hours 
ago in Hong Kong that Zacarias Costa was one of the people 
prevented from attending the Manila conference. The UDT vice 
president is said to have been mistreated by the Filipinos and 
heavily interrogated by the Hong Kong authorities. Ramos Horta 
recognizes that he will always have to negotiate with Suharto's 
government. Helder Fernando of TDM reports from Macao: 
  [Fernando] UDT President Joao Carrascalao and Jose Ramos 
Horta, speaking in the name of the resistance, confirmed that 
UDT Vice President Zacarias Costa was mistreated when he was 
trying to get to Manila to attend the conference on East Timor. 
He was detained by the Hong Kong authorities and he was 
interrogated. His integrity was called into question and he was 
asked questions such as whether he was linked to illegal 
movements. [passage omitted] 
  With regard to Indonesia, Ramos Horta said the following: 
  [Begin Horta recording] I have expressed to [Indonesian] 
Minister Ali Alatas and his representatives, the availability of 
the resistance, of my availability to talk to the minister at 
any time without preconditions. An independent East Timor 
obviously cannot avoid having Indonesia as a neighbor. We have 
to continue to collaborate and cooperate with Indonesia at all 
levels. [end recording]

  [Text] Following today's events in Manila concerning the 
conference on East Timor, we are now going to speak live to 
Foreign Minister Durao Barroso. 
  [[Unidentified interviewer] Good afternoon minister. What 
consequences may the Manila conference -- namely the Indonesian 
pressure -- have on the talks between the Portuguese and the 
Indonesian Governments? 
  [Durao Barroso] Good afternoon. First, the consequences of 
the Manila conference, up to now, have been to draw the 
attention of the entire international community to the question 
of East Timor. I am very happy indeed with this development. 
The whole of the international press is highlighting 
Indonesia's high-handed attitude toward the Philippines. The 
big international TV networks too have been drawing attention to 
this. So I regard the overall fruits of this conference as 
positive and even encouraging. It is altogether the opposite 
result to that sought by the Indonesian authorities with their 
high-handedness towards the Government of the Philippines. 
  As for the talks, I believe these events will obviously 
weaken the Indonesian position, because Indonesia cannot tell 
the UN secretary general that it wants to set up 
confidence-building measures and, at the same time, adopt 
attitudes that really reveal its true nature, that of a country 
that not only does not respect democratic values within its own 
territory but also does not want other countries in the region 
to be free to apply their own democratic principles. 
  [Interviewer] What do you think will be the practical 
consequences of all this on the next round of talks? Will 
Portugal step back? 
  [Durao Barroso] No, I cannot tell you that because I cannot 
foretell the future. The next round of talks will be as far 
away as January of next year. What I believe is that these 
events will considerably weaken the Indonesian position and this 
will be an encouragement for all those -- the Portuguese 
Government included -- who continue to believe that there is a 
possibility of reaching a solution, in accordance with the 
international law, for the East Timor question. 
  [Interviewer] It is exactly three years today since the 
Bicesse [Angolan peace] agreement was signed. Do you think it 
was a worthwhile exercise? 
  [Durao Barroso] It believe it is always worthwhile when you 
are trying to work toward peace. The truth of the matter is 
that, thanks to Bicesse, the Angolans managed to experience 
peace -- even if only for a short while -- as well as a 
democratic process and elections the results of which 
unfortunately were not respected. A war was then resumed that 
the Angolan people have so far not managed to get rid of. The 
truth of the matter is that the effort made by Portugal, by the 
observers and the international community, was a legitimate one, 
it was worthwhile and is within the context of those talks that 
the sides are now looking to the principles subscribed to in 
Bicesse to provide a model for national reconciliation so that 
peace may again become a reality in Angola. 
  [Interviewer] You were in Morocco today when the prime 
minister asked King Hassan II for help. What sort of help can 
the Moroccan king lend to this process between the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola and the Angolan 
Government? 
  [Durao Barroso] What the prime minister stated -- as you 
said, it is true that I was next to the prime minister -- was 
that any influence by King Hassan II can indeed be useful to 
lead the sides to reach a compromise. The link between Morocco 
and the Angolan process is widely known and within the framework 
established by the United Nations -- the UN mediation with the 
support of observers -- any push, any support from personalities 
with international recognition, such as King Hassan II, will 
indeed be positive for the process. 
  [Interviewer] Now for a final question. France and Germany 
are getting ready to take to the European Council a joint 
French-German joint presidency proposal to start on 1 July. Are 
you not afraid of a one-year presidency by these two European 
powers? 
  [Durao Barroso] We are not afraid at all. On the contrary, I 
believe that one of the great victories of the European Union 
over these years was that it has managed to end with the wars 
between Germany and France. Let me remind you that we are just 
at this time commemorating the anniversary of D day, which 
contributed toward putting an end to World War II. Nowadays we 
tend to forget that, my generation did not live through it. The 
truth of the matter is that, up to a few years ago, Europe was 
always being devastated by wars among European countries and 
therefore it is a great European victory for France and Germany 
-- for all European countries -- to make it practically unviable 
and impossible nowadays for anyone to even imagine a new war in 
western Europe. Therefore I am happy with any kind of 
collaboration among European states. 
  It is obvious that this does not mean that we will ever 
accept any kind of European directorate. Neither we nor other 
countries will accept the idea that there are two, three, or 
four European countries that by virtue of their size will impose 
their will upon others. I know that is not the wish of either 
France or Germany -- both of whom have from the outset done much 
for the construction of the European Community and European 
Union. We are both available to collaborate both with the 
Germans and the French because I am sure they will be a very 
strong stimulus for the progress of the European Union. 
  [Interviewer] Thank you very much, minister. That was 
Foreign Affairs Minister Durao Barroso, speaking to us live.

<F P=106> [Mariano Guindal and Mar Diaz-Varela report: "UGT </F>
Dissociates Itself From Strategy of Confrontation Advocated by 
Workers Commissions"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- New UGT [General Workers Union] Secretary 
General Candido Mendez yesterday showed significant differences 
from Workers Commissions Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez' 
increasingly radical line. The divergence in the two trade 
unions' political stances has also begun to manifest itself at 
the trade union level. Thus the UGT has dissociated itself from 
the strike called by Workers Commissions on Spanish National 
Railroads for 10 June and has distanced itself in the cases of 
Seat and Santana Motor. 
  Addressing the Workers Commissions Confederal Committee -- 
the top body between congresses -- Antonio Gutierrez demanded 
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' resignation or the calling of an 
early general election. In his opinion, Gonzalez' resignation 
is the only measure that could facilitate a real left-wing 
government to regain citizens' confidence. He also announced 
again major mobilizations to promote collective bargaining. 
  With respect to the European elections, he called for voting 
for United Left, through the exclusion of the other political 
parties. At the previous Confederal Council meeting, Gutierrez 
announced that he would call on the workers to punish 
electorally the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, the People's 
Party, Convergence and Union, and the Basque Nationalist Party 
for having supported the labor reform and for having come out 
against the 27 January general strike. 
  The trade union leader described the first signs of economic 
recovery "foolish triumphalism that has emerged over the past 
few days." In his opinion, "the official propaganda deeming the 
recession to be over has a very weak basis." 
  Nor did employers' organization chairman Jose Maria Cuevas, 
whom he accused of "political opportunism and irresponsibility 
with respect to the grave economic crisis," escape his harsh 
diatribe. He also criticized the government for not having 
prevented Banco Santander President Emilio Botin from acquiring 
Banesto, "without having first clarified his responsibilities in 
resounding tax scandals such as the single premiums" (he was 
referring to the assignation of credits case). 
  On the other hand, the new UGT leader, following the meeting 
with the new consultative body comprising all the leaders of 
associations and federations, tried to depoliticize his line in 
order to focus it on the trade union field. Candido Mendez 
announced that at the next meeting with the employers' 
organization, 6 June, he will submit three specific proposals -- 
promoting the ongoing vocational training agreements, increasing 
arbitration in labor disputes, and replacing the labor 
ordinances. In addition, he will call for a boost for collective 
bargaining. 
  Mendez stated that his trade union "will not enter into 
dynamics of a personal nature, and will not demand Felipe 
Gonzalez' resignation, since we trust in the democratic 
institutions' functioning and believe that this kind of 
assertion only contributes to their loss of prestige and lack of 
trust in them." 
  He stated that the UGT "will not demand an early election; 
rather, we will continue to demand that the course of economic 
policy change, and this entails a change in the parliamentary 
support currently forming the majority." 
  With respect to the corruption cases that have disturbed 
political life over the past few weeks, Mendez called for 
"respect for the institutions," and emphasized that it was the 
democratic system that made it possible to learn of and punish 
those corruption cases. "Those who criticize the institutions," 
he added, "are not praising the democratic system." 
  On the other hand, Gutierrez asserted that "the succession 
of 
scandals is above all a matter of a democratic deficit and the 
immunity of certain state bodies, which have not been 
sufficiently democratized at the top or in their ways of 
working." In his opinion, "what is happening is the 
government's responsibility." 
  With respect to voting advice for the European elections, 
the 
UGT leader again showed himself at a considerable distance from 
the Workers Commission leader. Mendez stated that his trade 
union "does not advise voting for or against any political 
party, out of respect for its members' independence and 
diversity." As he explained, "not even the most severe 
criticism of the labor reform is a reason for punishing the 
parties that supported it, since it is a domestic issue, and it 
is Europe's future that is being settled in the elections." 
  With respect to social consultation, the disagreement 
between 
the two leaders is noteworthy. In Gutierrez' opinion, "the 
current government's staying on is pernicious for the country. 
It is an exhausted government, incapable of regaining citizens' 
confidence, a source of constant discredit, and a stimulus for 
the advance of the conventional right represented by the 
People's Party." 
  On the other hand, in Candido Mendez' opinion, it is 
essential to restore dialogue and a pact, not only with the 
government but also with the employers' organization. Both 
leaders acknowledged that there has been a demobilization of the 
trade unions.

<F P=106> [John Jakobsen report: "`Wise Men' Put a Damper on </F>
Optimism" -- from the ERHVERV section] 
  [Text] The Economic Council -- also known as the "wise 
men" -- has put a slight damper on the government's optimistic 
expectations for 1994 and 1995. 
  On the other hand the wise men are confident of a stable 
recovery that will also last throughout 1996. 
  Their forecasts do not stretch any further into the future. 
But in the past the government has calculated that the recovery 
will last until the end of the century. 
  This is apparent from the resume that the Economic Council 
has published on the eve of the public discussion of their 
report itself on 1 June. 
  The government's Economic Overview, which Economy Minister 
Marianne Jelved (Radical Liberal) made public on 18 May, 
concludes that economic growth will rise by a total of 4 percent 
in 1994. Here the wise men expect growth of 2.8 percent. 
  The wise men are also restrained about 1995 when they expect 
GNP growth of 2.9 percent, while the government predicts growth 
of 3.4 percent. 
  For 1996 the wise men are alone in predicting a figure: GNP 
growth of 3 percent. 
  The difference in the two reports' views of the next two 
years can be seen clearly from the unemployment figures. The 
government expects unemployment to fall to 330,000 this year and 
305,000 in 1995. Here the wise men predict unemployment of 
335,000 this year, 317,000 next year, and 305,000 will only be 
achieved in 1996. One of the most important explanations of why 
there is a difference between the two reports is that they make 
different assessments of export possibilities. 
  The wise men are only expecting a 2.5-percent increase in 
exports this year, while the government is expecting a 
4.7-percent increase. This pattern is repeated in 1995, when 
the wise men expect a 3 percent and the government a 5.3-percent 
increase. 
  On the other hand they are agreed that there will be a major 
increase in imports. The wise men say 8.7 percent this year 
compared with the government's 9.4 percent. The wise men expect 
the high level of imports to continue into 1995 with an increase 
of 8.4 percent, compared with the government's 7.5 percent. 
  According to the wise men, it is the German market that will 
have a dampening effect on exports. Germany takes around 28 
percent of Danish exports, and the wise men are expecting growth 
this year in Germany of only 0.5 percent -- while the government 
expects double this -- 1 whole percent. 
  There are also differences in the views taken of the Danish 
consumer. The wise men expect an increase in private 
consumption this year of 5.1 percent, growing to 5.7 percent in 
1995, where the government keeps to 4.8 and 4.5 percent. 
  This has major repercussions for the balance of payments. 
The trend of a growing balance of payments surplus that has 
prevailed since 1986 begins to turn now. 
  The wise men expect a fall in the balance of payments 
surplus 
from 35 billion kroner in 1993 to 25 billion this year, 17 
billion next year, all the way down to a mere 12 billion kroner 
in 1996 -- a total fall of 65 percent. 
  "This is not an indication that we are squandering the 
balance of payments surplus. But when a recovery is domestic 
driven, as is the case in Denmark, this has to have an effect on 
the balance of payments. We simply have to hope that we do not 
repeat the mistakes from the first half of the eighties when we 
forgot about export markets and concentrated on the home 
market," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst. 
  The wise men expect the budget deficit to increase by 10 
billion kroner in the course of 1994 -- from 40 billion to 50 
billion kroner. Thereafter the wise men expect this deficit to 
fall in 1995 and 1996 to 36 billion and 22 billion kroner 
respectively. 
  This is due partly to the fact that the wise men are 
expecting that the government will be able to limit growth in 
public consumption to 0.7 percent in 1994, and 1.4 percent in 
both 1995 and 1996. 
  "Here the wise men have indeed been optimistic. I simply do 
not believe that the government will be able to keep growth down 
so low," said Jorgen Damgaard, the Jyske Bank's chief analyst. 
  However, the wise men are more or less in line with the 
government's own estimates. 
  The government's Economic Overview expects growth in public 
consumption this year of 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent next year.

<F P=106> [Carsten Steno report: "`Wise Men' Warn Lykketoft"] </F>
  [Text] While Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft says in a 
new report that everything is going "well, as we might expect," 
for the first time in months the government yesterday had to see 
important aspects of its policy attacked by economic experts. 
  In their semi-annual report the so-called economic wise men 
said that while it is true that we are experiencing a recovery, 
there are still major problems that remain unsolved -- not least 
on the labor market where thousands are being kept out of 
employment because minimum wages are too high. 
  According to the wise men, there is also the prospect of a 
significant fall in the balance of payments surplus that is 
under great pressure because we Danes have begun to spend money 
in earnest and are consequently boosting imports. At the same 
time the new vacation arrangements could -- if they are made 
permanent -- give rise to a need for tax increases or public 
spending cuts. Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft rejects the 
wise men's objections. 
  "The wise men take too gloomy a view of the Danish economy 
and it looks to me as if the report is based on figures that are 
too pessimistic and data that is outdated when compared with the 
data made available by the government," Mogens Lykketoft said. 
  The wise men's report comes as a welcome helping hand for 
the 
nonsocialist opposition that will use its conclusions in the 
Folketing session's closing debate today to attack the 
government's economic policy. "The government is squandering 
the economic recovery," Liberal Party deputy chairman Anders 
Fogh Rasmussen commented. He is backed by Conservative People's 
Party leader Hans Engell who believes that the wise men have 
documented some serious holes in the government's economic 
policy. 
  Chief economist Jorgen Damgaard of the Jyske Bank shares the 
wise men's concern over developments: 
  "The wise men had to call for adjustments in financial 
policy 
for a long time. Now I hope that they will not have to call for 
as long for a tightening-up of financial policy," he commented.

<F P=106> [TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA report: "Simple Question When </F>
Norway Votes on the EU"] 
  [Text] Should Norway join the EU -- the European Union? 
This simple formulation of a difficult question will be what 
the Norwegians will have to make up their minds about when the 
Norwegian referendum on EU membership is held on 28 November. 
The wording of the question is almost identical to that used in 
the Norwegian referendum on the EC in 1972. 
  "We are sticking with the same question as in 1972. It is 
important to have a question that is as simple as possible and 
to which the majority of voters can answer yes or no," Municipal 
Affairs Minister Gunnar Berge said. 
  This means that Norway has chosen a course different to the 
course that Sweden has chosen. The Swedes will instead have to 
answer the question: Do you think that Sweden should join the 
EU in line with the terms of the agreement between Sweden and 
the EU's member states? 
  In Norway protests would probably have been loud if the 
referendum had been about the agreement between Norway and the 
EU. Now both supporters and opponents of the EU have said that 
they are content with the wording of the question -- unlike the 
situation in Sweden where EU skeptics are irritated by the 
wording of the referendum question. They fear that the Riksdag 
will be able to circumvent the outcome of the referendum. 
  Yesterday also saw the official decision that the Norwegian 
referendum will take place on 28 November. In addition local 
authorities can, if they so wish, also give voters the chance to 
vote on the preceding day. 
  The draft legislation for the referendum has been so worded 
that those people who would have been able to vote in a Storting 
election this year have the right to take part -- that is, all 
Norwegian citizens who have reached the age of 18 by 31 December 
1994. 
  It is proposed that on 28 November polling stations be open 
between 0900 hours and 2100 hours. On Sunday, 27 November 
polling stations may open between 1300 and 1800 hours. 
  No results will be made public until all polling stations 
have closed nor may polls carried out among voters on 27 and 28 
November be made public before the polls have closed. 
  The minority Social Democratic government's proposal will 
have the support of the Conservative Party and the Progress 
Party in the Storting and will consequently be adopted. 
  No to the EU in Norway regrets that Finland intends to hold 
its referendum on EU membership on 16 November, before Norway 
and Sweden. The Europe Movement on the other hand hopes and 
believes that a possible future yes in Finland will produce a 
yes effect in Norway and Sweden too. 
  Both the yes and no sides will now take the initiative for 
greater cooperation with their sister organizations in these 
countries. 
  Eva Nordlund, deputy chairman of No to the EU, has followed 
the Finnish debate and noted that Prime Minster Esko Aho wanted 
the Finnish referendum to be held at the same time as Sweden's. 
But what will now happen is that the three Nordic EU applicants 
will hold their referenda at different times. The Swedes will 
vote on 13 November, the Norwegians two weeks later. 
  "It is what we have long been expecting. The pro-EU 
governments have wanted this sequence with Finland first, so 
that Finland can function as a crowbar for the yes side in 
Sweden and then Norway. We greatly regret the Finnish 
Government's decision," Nordlund said.

  [Text] Industry in Norway is threatening to transfer its 
operations abroad unless Norway joins the European Union [EU]. 
Norwegian industry, which is in difficulties, is operating on 
the strength of considerable state subsidies. According to 
recent European Free Trade Association [EFTA] statistics, 
industry in Norway receives subsidies that are nearly twice as 
high as in Finland, for instance. Ulla-Maria Johansen reports: 
  [Johansen] Of the countries seeking EU membership, Norway's 
industry is in the relatively weakest position because it 
receives most state subsidies in relation to each industrial 
job. According to EFTA's state subsidy statistics, each 
industrial job in Norway received over 15,000 kroner or over 
11,000 markkas in state subsidies in 1992. Finnish industry 
came second, with each industrial job receiving a state subsidy 
of over 6,000 markkas, nearly 50 percent less than Norwegian 
industry. Sweden comes third and Austria fourth in the 
statistics. 
  Without EU membership, it is feared that the position of 
Norwegian industry and industrial jobs will weaken considerably. 
Both Norwegian and major foreign enterprises are threatening to 
leave the country if the Norwegians say no to the EU in next 
November's referendum. Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder 
and owner of the Masa-Yards shipyard in Finland, will be moving 
its head office to the EU region. Of foreign companies, Alcatel 
STK and ABB are threatening to move their production and 
investments away from Norway if the nation says no to the EU. 
Japanese companies that are currently investing in the 
Norwegian market also intend to leave the country along with the 
EU membership plan [as heard]. The latest threat comes from the 
Japanese giant (Itoshu) Corporation, which has a turnover of 
nearly 1 trillion markkas. (Itoshu), investing in anything 
from the fishing industry to the car industry, has so far 
invested less than 1 billion markkas a year in Norway, but the 
company's plans are grand if Norway joins the EU. If Norway 
remains outside and Sweden and Finland become members, (Itoshu) 
regards the future of Norway's neighboring countries as bright 
for Japanese investments. This is Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Anne Wibble by </F>
Monica Bjorklund; place and date not given: "Wibble Wants To 
Save More -- Eventually"] 
  [Text] Saying that Sweden is on the right path but that 
another 20 billion kronor in savings are needed over the next 
few years for safety's sake, Minister of Finance Anne Wibble 
(Liberal Party) presented the government's supplementary budget 
yesterday. 
  The government wants to bring forward and expand its 
reorganization of state finances. This time it is proposing 
specific savings: a cutback in partial pensions. Next year's 
budget -- for 1995-96 -- will strengthen the budget by 25 
billion kronor. In all, the reorganization program will be 
expanded from 80 billion to 100 billion kronor and extended 
through 1999. 
  But the government is getting criticism from both the right 
and the left for stating specifically how it plans to produce 
those savings. 
  "We are unusually specific," Minister of Finance Wibble 
objected when SVENSKA DAGBLADET met her for an interview. "The 
custom usually is not to say anything about what one is going to 
do in the future." 
<H5>  From Pension System </H5>
  The government specifies the areas where money is to be 
saved. Much of the 25 billion kronor to be saved in 1995-96 will 
be taken from the pension system. 
  The government had previously been thinking of saving nearly 
6 billion kronor by raising the retirement age from 65 to 66 
years. It dropped that proposal as a concession to the Social 
Democrats during the pension negotiations. 
  Instead, the money will be found somewhere outside the 
pension system. Wibble mentioned the early retirement pension 
plan as one important area where proposed measures "will 
gradually appear." 
  According to the reorganization program, another 5 billion 
kronor are to be saved in the ATP [general supplementary 
pension] system. In this case the government is even thinking of 
increasing the employee contribution by 1 percent. 
<H5>  Cannot Increase Contribution </H5>
  Further savings yielding about 3 billion kronor are planned 
in the unemployment insurance system. The minister of finance 
declined to say whether these savings would also involve a 
higher employee contribution. 
  "It is not possible to tack on just any amount of employee 
contribution," she says. "I think that continuing to increase 
employee contributions by another 1 percent every year is 
overdoing it." 
  One item in the reorganization plan as presented earlier 
will 
not be moved up: the 2 billion kronor in reduced housing 
subsidies. 
  "We are holding off on that because of the situation in the 
housing market," Wibble says. 
  In addition to implementing the reorganization program more 
quickly, the government wants to increase its amount by 20 
billion kronor, a sum that will be saved in 1997-99. Here again, 
the pension system will contribute a large amount, but the 
minister of finance declined to say whether that would mean more 
increases in employee contributions or anything else. She 
pointed out that negotiations on the future pension system are 
still under way with the Social Democrats. 
<H5>  Says Nothing About the Rest </H5>
  Savings in the pension system, combined with "unchanged 
public consumption in real terms in 1999," account for 11 
billion of those 20 billion kronor. For the time being, the 
minister of finance is not saying anything about what the rest 
of it will consist of. 
  We asked: "Is it because this is an election year that the 
government does not want to say anything specific about future 
savings?" 
  "No," the minister of finance answered firmly. 
  "This is specific enough for people to realize that the 
government is not going into the elections on the basis of some 
kind of pie in the sky. We are going into the election on the 
basis of the two most important tasks concerning distribution 
policy. One is not to shove the bill for the national debt off 
onto those who are young today -- those of us who did the 
spending will also pay. And the other is to pursue a policy on 
business that will create jobs." 
<H5>  Wants To Stop Increase </H5>
  The government's goal is to stop the national debt from 
increasing by the end of the 1990's. To do that, the 
reorganization program must be carried out, and economic growth 
must be at least 3 percent per year from 1996 to 1999. 
  "But it is clear that if Sweden votes no on membership in 
the 
European Union [EU], we will have to reexamine a lot of things," 
Wibble said. 
  According to the minister of finance, any tax reductions 
next 
year will have to be financed separately from the reorganization 
program. And the tax reductions that may be considered will be 
concerned primarily with further improving conditions for 
business. 
  "Any tax reductions may well be financed within the tax 
system. Or we may come up with some brilliant idea for savings, 
but that seems much less likely, of course." 
  The fact that economic forecasts are now beginning to point 
in the right direction is due partly to the devaluation. The 
minister of finance admits this straight out. 
  "But it is due to a lot of other things as well: low pay 
increases in the collective bargaining agreement, lower employer 
social security taxes, lower energy taxes for industry, more 
competition, and productivity gains by the firms themselves. 
  ``Without all the measures adopted by the government, the 
outlook for the future would be very gloomy.'' 
  Yesterday the Social Democrats presented a study of 
distribution policy showing that since the nonsocialists came to 
power, conditions have grown worse for all households without 
large fortunes and access to stock ownership. 
  But Wibble is putting more faith in the Ministry of 
Finance's 
own calculations. They show that the gaps between the various 
income groups have grown smaller.

<F P=106> [Ake Ekdahl report: "Growing Numbers Hesitant About the EU"] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Swedish people's attitude to European Union 
[EU] membership remains stable but is characterized by a 
wait-and-see approach. The yes side has been weakened a little 
in the course of the spring. The number of undecided has 
increased. The no side remains unchanged. The "don't know" 
group has increased notably among Social Democratic voters. 
  This is what emerges from DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's opinion poll 
carried out in the last week of May when it is compared with the 
results in April and February. 

  -  The yes side today has 31 
percent against 34 percent in April and 35 percent in February. 
The whole series of figures since May 1992 is as follows: 39, 
35, 31, 29, 35, 34, 31. 
  -  The no side has 42 percent -- unchanged 
for the last three polls. The whole series: 38, 43, 45, 45, 
42, 42, 42. 
  -  Undecided voters or voters who do not intend to vote 
today total 27 percent, an increase of 3 percent since April and 
of 4 percent since February. The whole series: 23, 23, 24, 26, 
23, 24, 27. 

  The yes side's upward trend last winter has come to an end. 
Asked how the EU referendum will turn out in November, a 
majority of voters generally reply that they believe that the 
outcome will be a majority for yes. This is interpreted to mean 
that the yes side has a chance of gaining many supporters in the 
large group of the undecided. Today more than one voter in four 
has no firm view on the EU question. 
  Nonsocialist voters who are opponents of the EU are still 
hesitant about showing their true colors, because the no side is 
seen as a left-wing scheme. 
  Socialist voters who are supporters of the EU are 
vacillating 
because the yes side is still seen as a right-wing idea. 
  The percentage of those who are certain about the decision 
they have reached is large and growing on the no side. Today 65 
percent are completely certain about their "no" choice, against 
57 percent earlier this spring. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Over the last weekend in May Stockholm 
DAGENS NYHETER in Swedish and Stockholm SVENSKA DAGBLADET in 
Swedish published their respective opinion polls for May on 
voter support for Sweden's political parties. 
  DAGENS NYHETER published on page A7 of its 28 May edition a 
Dick Ljungberg article outlining the results of its poll, the 
major findings of which it summarized as follows: 
  "The Green Ecology Party qualifies for representation in the 
Riksdag, while New Democracy is on its way to being counted out 
in DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's poll on party standings for May. The 
four-party government coalition is losing ground now that less 
than four months remain until the election." 
  The article goes on to provide the following percentage 
figures for party standings: 
  ``The poll was carried out in the period 18-26 May and 
comprises 1,014 telephone interviews. 
  ``Results, with changes since May in parentheses: 
  ``Moderate Coalition Party 20.0 (minus 1.5), Liberal Party 
7.5 (unchanged), Center Party 6.0 (minus 1.5), Christian 
Democratic Party 5.0 (plus 1.5), Social Democratic Party 50.0 
(minus 1.0), Left Party 4.5 (plus 1.0), New Democracy 1.5 (minus 
0.5), Green Ecology Party 4.0 (plus 1.0), and other parties 1.5 
percent (plus 1.0). All changes are within the margin of 
statistical error. 
  ``The number of undecided voters is 10 percent.'' 
  SVENSKA DAGBLADET published on page 10 of its 29 May edition 
a Sigfrid Leijonhufvud article setting out the findings of its 
May opinion poll, which it outlined as follows: 
  ``Both the Social Democrats and the Left Party are making 
gains and together the socialist bloc has a total of 55 percent 
in SVENSKA DAGBLADET/Sifo's [Swedish Institute for Opinion 
Research] May poll. An election result along these lines would 
at a stroke render the parties in the current coalition 
government powerless. 
  ``In the April poll the government parties had in a month 
moved up a little over 1 percent on the left-wing bloc. The 
difference between the two blocs was 10.5 percentage points. 
But this was clearly no new trend. According to SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET/Sifo, the government parties only won 39.3 percent of 
voter support in May and this widens the gulf to 15.7 percentage 
points. 
  ``The socialist bloc strengthens its position in the run-up 
to the election chiefly because the Social Democrats register 
50.4 percent, an increase of 1.7 percentage points since the 
April poll. It is also significant that the Left Party seems to 
have broken the trend of decline since the 1991 election when 
the party won 4.5 percent of the vote. With 4.6 percent in the 
May poll as against 3.5 percent in the April poll, the Left 
Party would clear the 4-percent threshold for representation in 
the Riksdag if there were an election today. 
  ``When between 2 and 26 May Sifo asked its 3,708 
interviewees 
how they would vote if there were an election today, the 
Moderate Coalition Party won 21.3 percent (22.1) of voter 
support, the Center Party 7.3 (8.6), the Liberal Party 6.4 
(6.8), the Christian Democratic Party 4.3 (4.2) the Green 
Ecology Party 2.9 (2.9), New Democracy 2.0 (2.2), and other 
parties 0.8 (1.0). Compared with the April figures given in 
parentheses all the government parties with the exception of the 
Christian Democratic Party have suffered losses. The Center 
Party's losses of 1.3 percent are significant -- that is, 
statistically reliable. Other changes reported in the poll are 
not.''

  [Text] The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] has 
officially informed the UN Secretariat General that it will 
accept the second map on Maras [Varosha] and an agreement can be 
signed if the agreements reached in Vienna are added to the 21 
March document which was submitted to the sides in connection 
with the confidence-building measures [CBM] package. Following 
a meeting over dinner, which was held among the representatives 
of the TRNC, Turkey, and the United Nations at the President's 
Office last night, and which lasted approximately three hours, 
President Rauf Denktas read out to reporters the reply given to 
the UN Secretariat General. 
  The reply text stressed that the TRNC has the will to 
conclude an agreement with the Greek Cypriot side on the CBM 
issue in the hope and expectation of facilitating a 
comprehensive solution, which considers the realities on the 
island as the starting point, which is based on political and 
legal equality, and which consequently assures the equal 
distribution of authority. 
  The text noted: Acting out of this will, the TRNC will 
accept the ideas concerning the access to and security of Maras 
proposed by Mr. Robert Lamb during the meeting held in Vienna on 
11 and 12 May with Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's 
assistant special envoy in Cyprus, as well as the Maras map 
submitted by the United Nations, on condition that the 
agreements with regard to the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International 
Airport and the travel, foreign aid, and landing and take-off 
benefits to be granted to the Turkish Cypriot side reached 
during the said meeting on the basis of Mr. Lamb's ideas are 
included in the text of the agreement to be submitted to the 
signature of the sides. 
  The text sent to the UN Secretariat General also declared 
that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to correspond with the UN 
officials on the above-mentioned subjects. 
  After reading out the reply, Denktas answered reporters' 
questions. He said that Feissel informed him that he has 
certain problems, and he will contact New York. The UN 
officials do not want to change the 21 March document, Denktas 
noted. He stressed the need to seek the consent of the Turkish 
Cypriot side with regard to the new elements to be incorporated 
into the 21 March document. Responding to a remark that Greek 
Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis is not willing 
to accept any changes to the document, Denktas said: That is 
Kliridhis' concern. 
  In reply to another question whether the Turkish Cypriot 
side 
is saying a conditional yes, Denktas stated: We did not say 
conditional. Work was done in Vienna and results were obtained. 
We want these results to be incorporated into this agreement. 
These elements must be included into the 21 March document so 
that they can turn into an agreement and we can sign it. 
  On the subject of Maras, Denktas announced that the Turkish 
Cypriot side is ready to accept the second map. Answering a 
reporter who reminded him of Feissel's statement before the 
meeting on the promises made in Vienna, Denktas said that the 
promises made to the Turkish Cypriots were the focus of the 
hours-long discussions during the meeting. 
  In a statement after the meeting last night, Feissel said 
that comprehensive talks were held on all the aspects of the 
CBM's and that Denktas expressed his views on all the issues. 
Feissel declared: It was a constructive effort. 
  Refraining from giving concrete answers to questions on the 
outcome of the meeting, Feissel reported that he will convey the 
content of the talks to the UN secretary general. He said that 
the CBM's are still alive. Feissel also declined to answer a 
question on the content of the message he will send to the UN 
secretary general after the meeting.

  [Text] The foreign ministers of Cyprus and Greece, Alekos 
Mikhailidhis and Karolos Papoulias, will meet tomorrow in Athens 
to decide on the handling of the Cyprus issue in the near 
future. This was stated by Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis at 
Larnaca Airport upon his return from Paris, where he 
participated in the conference for stability in Europe. 
Mikhailidhis added that tomorrow's meeting with the Greek 
foreign minister is considered necessary due to the developments 
in the Cyprus issue. During the meeting, he said, we will 
exchange views and information and discuss the National 
Council's visit to Athens. 
  Mikhailidhis accused Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas of 
delaying tactics on the Cyprus issue and added that, with his 
stance, Denktas is trying to cause confusion in an attempt to 
avoid finally being blamed for the failure to implement the 
confidence-building measures. The foreign minister repeated 
that the Greek Cypriot side accepts the 21 March document as the 
final text, and warned that our side will not participate in any 
discussion to change it. 
  On the sidelines of the Paris conference, the foreign 
minister met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and 
U.S. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff, with whom he said 
he had an interesting talk. 
  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also announced that Greece and 
Cyprus have finalized a series of demands that will be put forth 
at the European Union summit that will be held on Corfu. These 
demands aim at promoting Cyprus' application to join the 
European Union. Mikhailidhis discussed the whole issue with 
Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos behind the 
scenes at the Paris conference. Our goal on Corfu, Mikhailidhis 
said, is to take another step toward setting a date for the 
beginning of accession talks.

  [Text] The Greek Cypriots are continuing their border 
provocations and shooting incidents. The Greek Cypriot National 
Guardsmen fired 12 shots, in twos or threes, towards the Turkish 
Cypriot side in the Lefke [Lefka] [word indistinct] region at 
2045 today. No one was killed or injured by the shots, which 
were probably fired from automatic weapons. Soldiers attached 
to the Security Forces Command acted with a cool head and did 
not respond to the provocations, preventing the incident from 
escalating any further. 
  Turkish Cypriot authorities lodged a protest about the 
incident with the UN Peace Forces. The Greek Cypriots fired 
shots on the Turkish Cypriot borders on three different 
occasions in the past week.

  [Text] According to information received by the Greek 
Foreign Ministry, more Greek minority members are being arrested 
in Delvine. Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said 
today that there is information that the Albanian authorities 
are searching for about 14 people. Four of them have already 
been arrested. 
  The Greek Government has addressed a strong warning to 
Albania to respect the Greek minority and described the Albanian 
actions as a more general policy of intimidation against the 
minority with the aim of causing panic and making people flee 
their homes. The Greek Government will use every legal means to 
protect the Greek minority, the Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stressed and described the Albanian Government's actions as 
tactics reminiscent of times condemned by the democratic 
community. 
  Along with representations lodged by the Foreign Ministry 
with both the [U.S.] State Department and the Albanian Foreign 
Ministry, the Greek side has withdrawn its proposal for a 
meeting between Greek and Albanian delegations to prepare a new 
meeting between their foreign ministers. 
  Referring to a State Department appraisal that Greek 
accusations of Albania's policy toward minority members are 
baseless, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said these appraisals 
have already been overshadowed by the new arrests in Delvine. 
  At noon today, Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign 
Ministry secretary general, and Yeoryios Angelakis the 
ministry's Balkan Affairs Department director, summoned U.S. 
Charge d'Affaires James Williams to the Foreign Ministry. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said a short time 
ago that, following the arrest of Greeks in Albania, Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias will have a telephone conversation 
with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. It will probably 
take place today. Venizelos reiterated for the last time that 
Greece considers the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations to 
depend on respect for the rights of the Greek minority in 
Albania. The government spokesman stressed that Greece will 
take all the necessary steps with international organizations 
and in the capitals of countries that have anything to do with 
the issue.

  [Text] Greek-Albanian relations are easing up following 
yesterday's statement by Albanian President Sali Berisha and the 
expected initiative of the European Union [EU] troika. 
  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today reiterated that 
Greece has never rejected any proposals for a dialogue, but 
noted that, if necessary, it is determined to take very drastic 
measures to deal with the Albanian provocations. Correspondent 
Mirella Kalostipi reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Kalostipi] Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias harshly warned the Albanian Government that Greece has 
the capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek 
minority and stressed that Tirana's credibility will be judged 
according to its behavior on human rights. He suggested that 
the Albanian authorities stay calm and criticized the ease with 
which they make slanderous accusations against Greece. 
  [Papoulias] Tirana must be particularly calm. It is very 
easy to make various slanderous accusations against Greece, but 
these are unacceptable. Of course, the Greek side has made its 
demarches at all the international forums, particularly the 
European Union. I believe the EU will soon undertake an 
initiative in the direction of protecting the Greek minority's 
human rights. 
  [Kalostipi] Answering a question, Papoulias clarified that 
the Greek Government does not intend to deport Albanians who 
live in Greece. However, he called upon the Albanian president 
to consider the financial benefits from the work of thousands of 
illegal Albanian immigrants in Greece. The foreign minister 
implied that control at the Greek-Albanian border will become 
much stricter. Papoulias also stressed that the issue of EU 
financial aid to Albania depends completely on its stance on 
human rights. 
  Referring to the charges against Omonoia Chairman Sotirios 
Kiriazatis and to his interrogation, Papoulias stressed that 
violent charges during supposed interrogations that aim to 
terrorize members of the Greek minority cannot continue. 
  [Papoulias] Once again I must warn Tirana that Greece has 
the 
capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek 
minority. 
  [Kalostipi] The foreign minister expressed concern at the 
recent number of attacks against the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 
Istanbul, but added that Greece is carefully and calmly 
following the events. He said he intends to meet his Turkish 
counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, on the sidelines of the NATO summit 
that will be held in Istanbul in a few days. Papoulias will 
express the Greek Government's dissatisfaction with the 
slanderous campaign against our country, alleging the training 
of Kurdish guerrillas on Greek territory. Papoulias described 
these accusations as unfounded, adding that they hinder 
Greek-Turkish relations.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias has left on a 
three-day official visit to Moscow as part of regular 
Greek-Russian political contacts. During his visit in the 
Russian capital, the Greek foreign minister will meet with his 
Russian counterpart, Andrey Kozyrev, and discuss the improvement 
of bilateral trade and economic relations, the Bosnian crisis, 
and the Balkan situation. 
  Shortly before his departure from the eastern terminal of 
Ellinikon Airport, the foreign minister told correspondents: I 
can only stress once again the importance of this visit. Our 
relations with Russia are excellent. I believe that we have 
quite a few questions on bilateral relations to discuss in a 
positive context and promote them. Mr. Papoulias added: I 
refer to natural gas and the oil pipeline. If we reach an 
agreement on these, and I am certain that we will, they will be 
two important projects for Greece's economy as well as for 
Greek-Russian economic relations. 
  The foreign minister added: Of course, Russia is playing a 
pioneer role in the peace process for the former Yugoslavia. 
Many of our own positions are similar to those of Russian 
foreign policy. I believe that we will hold detailed discussions 
and that we will probably undertake joint initiatives, such as 
convening again the five-member conference between the United 
States, Russia, France, Great Britain, and the European Union's 
troika, which was held in Geneva on 13 May.

<F P=106> [From the "Our View" column: "Search for Guardians"] </F>
  [Text] The latest crisis that broke out in Greek-Albanian 
relations as a result of the provocations of the Tirana 
government brought to the foreground again the issue of the 
general orientation of the current government's foreign policy. 
Irrespective of the final outcome, the developments of the past 
few days cause great concern for the delicate balance of powers 
in the Balkans. This is especially true when one takes into 
account that a number of factors tend toward instability, and 
there are many things that exist or have been fabricated that 
can in any time cause the situation to explode. 
  The U.S. State Department's positions regarding the Greek 
arguments on the violation of the Greek minority's rights in 
Albania seek to justify the Tirana government. The main result, 
though, is that the State Department's positions belie the hopes 
placed by the government of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] on the development of particularly "warm" relations 
with the United States. 
  From the beginning of its term, this government has tried by 
all means to win the favor of the United States in order to use 
it in dealing with almost all foreign policy problems (Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], 
Greek-Turkish relations, the Cyprus issue, relations with 
Albania). In order to gain this favor, the government has 
pretty much "put itself" at the service of U.S. foreign policy 
and its aims in the Balkans. The government justified this 
choice as a necessary answer to the offending positions of 
Greece's EU [European Union] partners. 
  As is known, in recent years the Albanian leadership has 
capitalized on the U.S. intention to gain an advanced outpost in 
the "hot" zone in the south of the former Yugoslavia by offering 
"land and water." Consequently it won the title of a "U.S. 
protectorate." As a result, when the crisis in Greek-Albanian 
relations broke out as a result of the incident at Episkopi, the 
Greek Government placed many hopes that it would be settled by 
U.S. intervention with Albania. This obvious expectation was 
also raised during Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's trip to 
the United States, where, among other things, the government 
offered to play the role of "Trojan horse" for U.S. economic 
penetration of the Balkans. At that time, the current National 
Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou characteristically said in 
New York: "The Balkan people do not want the Americans very 
much, because of their past as a superpower." The "clearing up" 
of this "past," which has been transformed into a more agonizing 
"present," was assumed by the government. But now what? 
  Ever since PASOK came to power, we said that the "carte 
blanche" handing of all unsettled disputes to the United States 
not only would not be in Greece's favor, but on the contrary 
would worsen conditions. The history of this "subjection," for 
which PASOK has successfully passed the test, teaches us that 
giving in to the orders of imperialism is the worst service to 
the national interests. There is a scope for exercising 
national policy in the Balkans. The issue is that the 
government does not appear willing to abandon the search for 
"guardians."

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Iordhanidhis] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. State Department's positions on the 
problem of Albania's Greek minority and the Turkish claims about 
Kurdish "terrorists" being trained in Greece have begun shaking 
the faith of a large segment of the government, and the Greek 
leadership, in general on the possibility of closer cooperation 
with the United States for stability in the region. 
  The fact that U.S. President Bill Clinton's positions 
regarding the Greek minority in Albania were satisfactory and in 
accordance with the principles that supposedly govern U.S. 
foreign policy in regard to human rights is small consolation. 
Equally irrelevant for the Greek side is whether, in practice, 
the relations between the White House and State Department are 
harmonious. 
  What matters is that, according to the Greek Government, 
State Department bureaucracy is primarily interested in the 
stability of Enver Hoxha's doctor and current Albanian 
president, Sali Berisha, and not in the Tirana regime's 
adherence to the principles of CSCE and Copenhagen regarding 
respect for human rights. 
  This position, official sources in Athens stressed, has by 
now led the Greek Government to handle its troublesome relations 
with Tirana mainly at the bilateral level, regardless of any 
appeals to international organizations, which it will intensify 
but without expecting positive results. Confirmation of this 
came from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who said on Friday 
[27 May] that, "if the violations of the Greek minority's rights 
continue, there will a conflict with Albania at the diplomatic 
and political levels." 
  From the very beginning of its term in office, the current 
Greek government, and specifically Foreign Minister Papoulias, 
promoted a policy of restoring relations between Athens and 
Tirana despite the high domestic cost. In his approach, 
Papoulias was also supported by the U.S. State Department; but 
last week it suddenly shook the current balance by adopting 
Berisha's positions. 
  Well-informed sources stress that following the State 
Department's shift, its calls for a dialogue cannot be taken 
seriously in Athens because the U.S. role in relation to Albania 
is no longer that of "an honest referee," as the Greek side 
desired. Consequently, if the current situation with regard to 
Albania continues, the Greek Government's reaction will be 
"extremely severe," simply because the doctrine "Cyprus is too 
far away" cannot be applied in the case of the Albanian Greeks. 
  The State Department's second controversial statement--that 
it is examining reports about the training of Kurds in 
Greece--is seen in Athens as a naive attempt to reinforce a 
shaky regime which, despite the fact that for 10 years it has 
been unable to impose its control in Turkey's eastern provinces 
with the West's tolerance and silence, is still trying to 
internationalize a domestic issue by blaming others. 
  There is no practical reason for the Kurds to be trained in 
Greece or anywhere else, because for 10 years they have trained 
under actual combat conditions in eastern Turkey. At the same 
time Athens believes that the claims by the Turkish security 
authorities--according to which Kurds from Frankfurt arrived in 
Greece and trained for five months on explosives, then went to 
Iran from whence they entered Turkey, and ended in Izmir, where 
they were going to carry out sabotage--cannot even be a part of 
an investigation by the services of a big power much less be 
addressed in public by official remarks by the State Department 
spokesman. 
  Of course the State Department's positions regarding 
Albania's Greeks and the issue of the Kurds, as mentioned above, 
reflect a sharp decline in the U.S. Administration's views of 
the quality of some decisions by the Greek political leadership. 
  During the last couple of years, the behavior of 
corresponding European Union [EU] state mechanisms was similar. 
In that case, though, the possibility of frequent contacts at 
the highest level--that is, once every six months at the EU 
Summit--gave former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis an 
opportunity to intervene and get some understanding and 
tolerance from the European political leaders. 
  In the case of relations with the United States though, 
despite the very good personal relation established between the 
U.S. President and Papandreou, the frequency of contacts in 
relation to those existing in the EU framework is limited. As a 
result, the State Department's role appears to be more important. 
  Consequently, the problem is identified as a lack of direct 
"political" dialogue between Athens and Washington as it exists 
within the European Union. Official sources in Athens stressed 
that, due to the lack of "political" dialogue and given the 
State Department's negative stance, there are doubts as to 
whether the Greek political leadership can count on operational 
contact with Washington for the benefit of stability in the 
Balkans.

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "As Usual..."] </F>
  [Text] While the U.S. State Department spokesman was 
saying that the U.S. Government does not have any evidence 
regarding the oppression of the Greek minority in Albania, the 
[Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime was arranging to 
provide the evidence. 
  Following the arrest and serious charges brought against six 
members of Omonoia, yesterday the Tirana regime launched a new 
wave of persecutions by arresting 30 North Ipirotans at 
Gjirokaster and four at Delvine (they have been released for the 
time being) and searching for another 10. 
  What other evidence does the State Department need to be 
convinced that human rights in Albania are being systematically 
violated with persecutions that aim at terrorizing the Greek 
minority? 
  Tirana's goal is clear: It wants to drive the North 
Ipirotans out of Albania and implement known methods that Turkey 
had implemented for the extermination of the Greeks in Istanbul, 
Imroz, and Tenedos. 
  The State Department does not have evidence. Didn't U.S. 
President Bill Clinton have evidence a month ago, during the 
Greek prime minister's visit, when he said that he was concerned 
about the Greek minority in Albania? What has happened since 
then? 
  This is not just double-talk by the United States, but 
hypocrisy, which sometimes--according to the interests 
served--shows super sensitivity for human rights whereas usually 
it is indifferent. 
  Some 40 years ago, when the Hellenism of Istanbul, Imroz, 
and 
Tenedos was being expelled, the U.S. stance was similarly 
hypocritical. At that time as well, the United States did not 
have evidence. 
  As for Cyprus, at the time of the Attila invasion, the 
United 
States did not have evidence, as it still does not have any for 
the continuing occupation of Cyprus. But for Kuwait, the United 
States found the evidence in the value of oil. 
  It is hypocritical to put on the same scale, the interests 
of 
the superpower and human rights, for which every U.S. leader is 
supposedly interested and issues a Sultan's order. 
  It is hypocritical to cut 25 percent of aid to Turkey for 
the 
genocide of the Kurds while at the same time cutting aid to 
Greece as "punishment" for the embargo against Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. What scale 
equals a systematic genocide with the measures of a state 
against a provocative neighbor? 
  Perhaps the answer is found in the American expression: 
Business as usual.... [expression published in English].

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Support"] </F>
  [Text] It appears that [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's 
regime not only does not understand us, but it is even 
intensifying its provocations with persecutions and statements 
that completely flaunt the truth, with the very obvious aim of 
deceiving the international community and international public 
opinion. 
  In a statement issued yesterday, the Albanian Foreign 
Ministry accuses the Greek Government of war-like talk. It 
underlines that "playing another Bosnia in the southern Balkans 
would mean a widespread Balkan war for which Greece will be 
fully responsible. The policy of threatening Albania is a policy 
of failure." 
  The Albanian Foreign Ministry though, does not say anything 
about the wave of terrorism that has been launched against the 
North Ipirus people. It says nothing about group arrests and 
interrogations. 
  Of course it says nothing, since the U.S. State Department, 
which supposedly does not have any evidence of the oppression of 
the Greek minority in Albania, has not said anything either. 
  It is this "lack of evidence" and many other things that 
encourage Tirana to continue its provocations and accuse Greece 
of seeking another Bosnia in the southern Balkans. 
  Greece does not seek another Bosnia nor any war, but seeks 
peace in the Balkans and good relations with all its neighbors. 
  However, the development and further improvement of good 
relations with Albania depends on respect for human rights and 
the rights of the Greek minority. 
  With its terrorizing of the Greek minority, Berisha's regime 
proves that it is not a state of law. It needs to prove 
continuously to the international community that it is 
developing into a state of law, a state of democratic freedoms, 
with respect for human rights. 
  Of course, the U.S. Government, which is the main supporter 
of Berisha's regime, knows this; it just pretends it does not. 
That is where the responsibility lies for Tirana's 
provocations, which depict Greece, a country that hosts 500,000 
Albanians and supports its economy, as seeking war. 
  If the U.S. hypocrisy stops, Tirana will immediately stop 
its 
provocations too.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Stavros Liyeros: "The Uprooting of North </F>
Ipiros Citizens"] 
  [Text] The new wave of arrests in North Ipiros proves that 
the tension in the relations between Athens and Tirana is the 
choice of the [Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime and not 
just a result of mistrust. The incident at Episkopi was used as 
a golden opportunity for the promotion of anti-Greek propaganda 
and to justify preplanned persecutions against minority members. 
  If the first wave of arrests was done to discover some 
evidence to support the claim about a Greek intervention, the 
second wave of arrests had exclusively political aims. Tirana's 
first aim is the cultivation of a climate of terror and fear 
among the North Ipiros citizens to force them to flee. Tirana's 
strategic aim is not the neutralization of any offensive 
tendencies [by the Greek minority] but the uprooting of the 
minority. 
  Tirana's stance toward the Greek minority is indirectly but 
clearly connected with its demands in Kosovo. By showing its 
own offensive ideology, Tirana is certain that Athens will make 
the same demands on North Ipiros that it has made on Kosovo. 
For this reason, Tirana seeks the expulsion of Greeks before 
things reach the negotiating table. 
  All of the above is taking place during a time of economic 
downfall, social degradation, and fanatic aggressiveness, 
something that creates the conditions to channel the internal 
crisis toward dangerous adventurism. That is why the 
possibility that the Albanian side will launch a pogrom against 
the Greek minority remains open. Athens has the obligation to 
prevent it by making clear, well in advance, its decision not to 
allow such a development. 
  Tirana's second aim, which is the destruction of bilateral 
relations and the creation of an offensive climate to stop the 
rise of the Greek-oriented conscience within significant parts 
of the Orthodox Albanian or Albanian elements, is equally 
important. This aggressiveness is not due to some unfounded 
Greek propaganda but to the revival of Islam and discriminatory 
feelings among the Orthodox Albanians. This is the reason why 
the Berisha regime attacks Archbishop Anastasios with such 
force, even though he is limited to his religious duties.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Ankara Ignores Iranian Proposal </F>
for Joint Operation. Turkish Officials Make Arrangements for 
Meeting With Iraqi Kurdish Leaders"] 
  [Text] London -- Iran appears to have failed to convince 
Turkey of the possibility of a joint operation inside the Iraqi 
Kurdish areas which have, over the past three weeks, witnessed 
an armed conflict between the two largest parties there. 
According to identical reports from the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani and the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan [PUK] led by Jalal Talabani, Turkish Government 
officials have intensified their contacts with the two Kurdish 
leaders to help them bridge their views and end the estrangement 
resulting from the recent fighting between them. 
  Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Turkish 
officials are making arrangements for a tripartite meeting in 
Turkey to be attended by representatives of the Turkish 
Government and the two Kurdish parties, and probably by PUK 
Secretary General Jalal Talabani who is now in Damascus. 
  The Turkish sources said that the discussions at the meeting 
would not be confined to the tension between Barzani and 
Talabani but would also cover relations between Ankara and the 
Kurdish administration in northern Iraq and the situation 
resulting from the exodus of thousands of Turkish Kurds to Iraqi 
Kurdistan to escape the military operations carried out by the 
Turkish Army in the Kurdish areas adjacent to the border with 
Iraq against fighters of the outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK]. 
  The sources expected the meeting to be held after the 'Id 
al-Adha holiday. The Turkish press reported last week that a 
visiting Iranian delegation had suggested to Ankara that a joint 
operation be launched to put an end to the fighting in Iraqi 
Kurdistan. 
  According to PUK sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
elements are taking part in the operations against PUK forces in 
areas near the border with Iran, and Iranian artillery is 
shelling Iraqi Kurdish areas from across the border. Other 
Kurdish forces and international relief officials have confirmed 
these reports but KDP sources have not. 
  Iran has accused Talabani's party of providing shelter and 
aid for the Kurdish parties opposed to the Iranian Government. 
  Turkey feels that instability in northern Iraq suits the 
PKK, 
which has been fighting the Turkish state for 10 years, in that 
it enables the PKK to set up bases and staging posts in the 
mountainous areas near the border with Turkey. 
  It is worth noting that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel 
announced at a press conference last Monday [23 May] that Turkey 
intended to contact Barzani and Talabani "to promote a peaceful 
solution between them." 
  As regards the armed conflict between the parties of Barzani 
and Talabani, sources of the two parties in the areas where the 
clashes started early this month say that the situation there 
ranges from guarded calm to limited clashes in isolated spots. 
The sources are cautious when it comes to the question of 
whether or not the current truce would develop into a firm peace. 
  Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that earlier this week 
Barzani and Talabani spoke to each other by telephone, for the 
first time in several days, and, the sources say, they also 
exchanged fax messages focusing on the cease-fire agreements 
reached by their two parties and "emphasizing the importance of 
Talabani's presence in Kurdistan alongside Barzani to implement 
these agreements."

<F P=106> [Statement by the National Security Council dated 28 May </F>
1994 -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The National Security Council [NSC] convened under 
President Suleyman Demirel in a routine monthly meeting today. 
The meeting was attended by Acting Prime Minister Necmettin 
Cevheri, the chief of the General Staff, the ministers who are 
members of the Council, the force commanders, the gendarmerie 
commander, and the NSC secretary general. The meeting was also 
attended by the deputy prime minister and state minister, and 
because issues concerning their ministries were discussed, by 
State Ministers Ibrahim Tez and Abdulbaki Atac, and Public Works 
and Housing Minister Onur Kumbaracibasi. 
  1. At the meeting, the NSC reviewed and assessed the 
security and public order situation in the country in general 
and the domestic and foreign developments that affect it. It 
determined that the successful results being obtained in the 
struggle against separatist terrorism, and that the support our 
people give our security forces in this struggle, increases 
daily. The NSC also determined that, faced with the heavy 
losses incurred by the separatist organization recently, 
surrender would be beneficial for our youths who have been used 
as tools in this adventure against the unity of our country. 
  The NSC decided to recommend to the government to continue 
with economic and social measures in parallel with antiterrorist 
efforts in the area. 
  2. Considering the need for existing measures and for the 
exercise of authority, the NSC unanimously decided to extend the 
state of emergency currently in effect in Batman, Bingol, 
Bitlis, Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli, and 
Van by another four months as of 1700 on 13 July 1994. The NSC 
decided to inform the government of this decision.

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "PKK's Plan on Northern Iraq"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has 
drawn up a new plan for northern Iraq. It has been ascertained 
that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has suffered significantly 
from the consecutive blows by the Turkish security forces to his 
organization, has put into effect an insidious plan to "cause 
new problems for Turkey" in northern Iraq by cooperating with 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] leader Jalal Talabani. The 
PKK has persuaded many pro-PKK families in the Sirnak region to 
emigrate to northern Iraq. Some 20,000 people have crossed 
Turkey's border thus far. The emigrants moved from Isikveren 
and Sinath to areas known as the Seranish Fala and Seranish 
Islam, which are between Zakho, Kasrog, and Parak. They have 
established three settlements in the two areas. 
  It has been ascertained that the majority of the emigrants 
are from the Guyam tribe. The officials have said that half of 
the tribe supports the government and many men serve as village 
guards. However, many of the remaining families are sympathetic 
to the PKK. 
<H5>  Emigration </H5>
  Turkey is carefully watching the wave of emigration, which 
began in the latter half of February. The officials have 
established that several UN officials visit the three settlement 
every day to register the emigrants and supply them with food 
and clothing. 
  The intelligence sevices have drawn up a report to inform 
the 
prime minister of the new situation. The report, which has 
already been submitted to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, describes 
the PKK's new strategy as follows: 
  1. The PKK wishes to create a significant wave of emigration 
in order to persuade international organizations, the UN 
organization in particular, to take action. 
  2. The PKK wishes to create the impression that the 
operations the security forces carry out in Turkey are organized 
against innocent people and not the PKK. 
  3. Considering the fact that it has been unable to establish 
a foothold in areas close to Turkey's border as a result of the 
Turkish cross-border operations, the PKK wishes to establish 
safe areas for itself in the interior of northern Iraq. The PKK 
is aware that Turkey will not bomb the settlements in which 
thousands of women and children will live, so they will provide 
adequate shelter for the militants. 
  4. The PKK will move to cooperate with PUK Leader Jalal 
Talabani when the pro-PKK population increases in northern Iraq. 
The two sides will then take joint action against Democratic 
Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani. 
  5. The number of settlements will be increased in time. 
Later, all of them will be joined together. That will create 
an opportunity for the PKK to place a large area under its 
control. Naturally, that will be the first of the steps the PKK 
will take to establish a Kurdish state. 
<H5>  The DPK Is Careful </H5>
  The dangerous developments that have taken place during the 
past three months have moved the DPK into action. Mas'ud 
Barzani has warned the emigrants that he will "force them to 
return to Turkey if they cooperate with the PKK." That 
indicates his sensitive approach to the matter. Meanwhile, 
Turkish officials have explained to Barzani the objective behind 
the wave of emigration and urged him to help them. 
<H5>  Ocalan's Instructions </H5>
  Abdullah Ocalan sent a message on 29 March ordering the 
establishment of settlements in various parts of northern Iraq. 
He also instructed his militants to put pressure on the local 
authorities to force them to agree that the PKK will be 
responsible for the defense of the settlements. Ocalan said 
that "the settlements will be rear bases, which the PKK will use 
as safe havens." He also explained that this action was to have 
been taken in 1990, but it was frustrated by the Gulf War. 
  It has been established that Jalal Talabani has played a 
very 
important part in the new design. He has supported PKK's plan 
since securing its assurance that the emigrants in northern Iraq 
will vote in for the PUK in the elections of October 1994. 
<H5>  Democracy Party's Role </H5>
  The PKK has achieved a certain degree of success through 
forcing the people in southeastern Turkey to emigrate to 
northern Iraq. It has been ascertained that a group of 
parliamentarians from the German Bundestag's Human Rights 
Subcommittee visited the settlements to study the situation on 
4-10 May. Three Democracy Party deputies visited northern Iraq 
shortly after the German visit to try to convince the DPK and 
PUK to agree to a cease-fire. Officials in Ankara have 
described their visit as meaningful. It has been reported that 
the three deputies, accompanied by several correspondents, will 
also visit the three settlements. The officials are convinced 
that the Democracy Party has launched an initiative to draw 
attention in Turkey to the situation in northern Iraq.

  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, has declared that the Cyprus question has 
reached a turning point that requires a new persepctive. 
Denktas held a news conference in Kastamonu, where he is being 
hosted by the Ilgaz Group. 
  In his news conference, Denktas asked that the pressure and 
threats directed against the Turkish Cypriot side cease and that 
there be a realistic bid to resolve the problem. According to 
TRT correspondent Ihsan Gunal, Denktas remarked that the Greek 
Cypriots are amassing weapons on the island and they are 
planning to establish an air force and to allow Greece to build 
a naval base in Baf [Paphos]. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] This is madness; but, we cannot 
stick our neck out just because the Greek Cypriots have gone 
insane and we cannot say yes you are right to all their moves. 
[end recording] 
  Denktas noted that the Greek Cypriots are engaged in efforts 
to join the European Union [EU] and if this comes about they 
will merge with Greece. The Greek Cypriots are already 
concluding various bilateral agreements with the Greeks, Denktas 
noted. He announced that if the Greek Cypriots become a member 
of the EU, then the Turkish Cypriots could opt for economic and 
political integration with Turkey under conditions to be agreed 
upon. This will convey the following message to the Greek 
Cypriots, Denktas explained: The moves you make can be 
reciprocated and we will courageously undertake such reciprocal 
moves. Denktas said that Turkey and the Turkish factor should 
not be forgotten with regard to this issue. 
  In reply to a question, Denktas said that he will not submit 
the integration proposal to the Turkish Government. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] However, the assessment of the 
situation and the exchange of views we conducted indicate that 
this is the only solution in the face of continuing Greek 
Cypriots moves. [end recording] 
  Later, Denktas flew by helicopter from Kastamonu to Ankara.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has called on the United 
Nations to write down the promises it made in Vienna in a 
document. 
  Denktas is continuing to hold contacts in Turkey. He met 
with President Suleyman Demirel yesterday. Replying to 
reporters' questions after the meeting, Denktas said that, if 
the promises made in Vienna are submitted to him in written 
form, he will take them to the Turkish Cypriot Republican 
Assembly. 
  Denktas said that he told President Demirel of the 
difficulties, that a great injustice is being done to the 
Turkish Cypriot side, and that the problem cannot be resolved in 
this way. He added: We are ready to hold negotiations that 
will eliminate this injustice and the imbalances. 
  Replying to a question on the issue of Maras [Varosha], 
Denktas stressed that for the Turkish Cypriot side to accept the 
second map, which has certain additions, it must be given 
something in return. He pointed out that the issue is whether or 
not the Turkish Cypriots will benefit from the agreement in the 
way the Greek Cypriots will. 
  President Demirel, in turn, said that the economic problems 
of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and its political 
problems with the United Nations will be overcome.

on the Cyprus issue that she held a comprehensive exchange of 
views with President Rauf Denktas yesterday. She stressed that 
the document of ideas submitted to the two sides by the UN

confidence- building measures previously approved by the 
Security Council. Ciller pointed out that progress was made 
during the Vienna talks held on 11 and 12 May with a view to 
eliminating the deviations. She added: If this understanding 
can be translated into written form and confirmed by the United 
Nations, then future-oriented steps can be taken. 
  Ciller stressed that Turkey will support the views to be 
posited by Denktas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Turkish-Kazakh oil agreement has been signed in 
Ankara which is expected to significantly meet Turkey's energy 
deficit and which will generate a revenue of $2 billion 
annually. Under the agreement, the Kazakh-Turkish MU NAY company 
jointly established by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation and the 
Kazakh oil company will begin production in August. 
  The agreement was signed by Veysel Atasoy, minister of 
energy 
and natural resources, and by Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan deputy 
prime minister. 
  In a speech at the signing ceremony, Atasoy said that oil 
exploration has ended in Kazakhstan and no obstacles remain 
before production. Abishev said, in turn, that his country 
wants to share its riches with Turkey. He pointed out that with 
the agreement, Turkey is no longer an oil-consumer but an 
oil-producer. 
  In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television after the 
signing ceremony, Atasoy said that the agreement covers a period 
of 36 years: 11 for exploration and 25 for production. The 
Turkish Petroleum Corporation will invest for exploration, while 
the two sides will share the investment for production in 
proportion to their shares. 
  Of the oil to be produced as of August 1994, 206,000 tonnes 
will be brought to Turkey. The total oil reserves in the area 
are estimated to be $4 billion barrels. At the end of 1995, 
130,000 barrels of oil and 13.5 million cubic meters of gas will 
be produced daily. The agreement envisages daily productions of 
481,000 barrels of oil in 2001 and 68.5 million cubic meters of 
gas in 2002. 
  [Begin Atasoy recording] The oil reserves in our shared area 
with Kazakhstan is estimated to be 4 billion barrels and the gas 
reserves to be 387 billion cubic meters. Of this, 2.16 billion 
barrels of oil and 208.9 billion cubic meters of gas belong to 
the Turkish Petroleum Corporation. In dollar terms, this means 
we will save $32.4 billion from the oil and $16.7 billion from 
the gas. In other words, a total of $49.1 billion will be saved 
in a period of 25 to 26 years. Turkey will close its energy 
deficit. Of course, natural gas is as important for us as oil. 
Environmental issues are very important in our day. Natural 
gas is the cleanest source of energy. In the future, we are 
thinking of building natural gas power stations. [end recording] 
  Before the signing ceremony, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
received Kazakhstan Deputy Prime Minister Syzdyk Abishev. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] Our share of the production there 
will be almost as much as our production in Turkey. Our 
revenues will be about $1 billion yearly as of next year. We 
aim at expanding this further in the future. This is a very 
happy occasion for us. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "The Veto Proves the Cabinet's </F>
Weakness"] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has been warning for the 
past one-and-a-half months that the austerity measures should be 
aimed at solving the current problems of the country and warns 
that these steps should not create new and greater problems. 
  It seems the government did not take these warnings too 
seriously and went ahead to implement certain measures with the 
potential of creating social disorder in an already volatile 
society. 
  Demirel has been urging the leaders all along not to take 
excessive measures like closing down factories and other state 
facilities, which will only serve to increase the jobless rate 
in Turkey and sow the seeds of social upheaval. The president 
is aware that some sensible austerity measures are needed but 
sees that this should not create social discord in the society. 
If the price of immediate economic salvation is social unrest 
then the president says we have to accept the fact that the 
austerity measures can be delayed or can be implemented at a 
slower pace to avert a crisis which could eventually turn into 
political turbulence. 
  This is one of the reasons why the president on Wednesday 
vetoed the bill which was designed to sell off all residential 
accommodation and social facilities owned by the government. 
This would have meant the accommodation provided for civil 
servants at highly reduced rates being taken away from them and 
being sold by the State to the public to earn money.... The 
president felt the loss to the country because the anger and 
social unrest created by the sale of the homes for civil 
servants would far exceed the revenue of 100 trillion Turkish 
lira expected from the sale of these accommodations to the 
public. The president says civil servants cannot afford current 
rents but, with their meager salaries, can only afford low-rent 
State accommodation. The loss of these privileges would create 
deep resentment among civil servants and this is the last thing 
the country needs at the moment. 
  Both Demirel and Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk 
share 
the view that social unrest has to be avoided at all costs, 
because once the people take to the streets it will be very hard 
to convince them to return to their homes. One leading state 
official, who asked not to be named, told the TURKISH DAILY 
NEWS: "If these trends continue and the workers as well as the 
civil servants spill into the streets none of us would be able 
to face them any more." This is clearly what Demirel sees on 
the horizon and is set to avert. 
  So Demirel did his duty and took the appropriate decision to 
veto the bill. When he did so, the coalition partners, instead 
of feeling betrayed or voicing some kind of criticism, seemed to 
bow to the verdict and reacted in a positive manner. Deputy 
Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, the leader of the Social 
Democrat People's Party (SHP), was quick to say there were 
several clauses in the bill which they felt were defective and 
that the veto gave them the opportunity to correct these 
mistakes.... True Path Party (DYP) spokesman Hasan Peker said 
the president had given the government the opportunity to make 
amends. 
  This is a rather odd situation. If the two parties governing 
Turkey jointly felt the law was defective then why didn't they 
try to correct their mistakes in the Parliament, and why did 
they simply allow such a bill to clear the house? 
  This is a government which cannot even defend its own 
legislation. The entire episode demonstrates the incompetence 
and weakness of the coalition administration. Turkey clearly 
does not deserve this.

  [Text] Ankara--Record high interest rates offered on 
T-bills by the cash-starved Treasury have given a boost to the 
Turkish lira but have angered several businessmen who are 
already fighting for survival due to surging lending rates. 
  On Friday [27 May], the third trading session after the 
religious holiday, the Turkish lira [TL] firmed to 31,000 
against the U.S. dollar, after Thursday's close of 32,000. It 
was traded at 33,000 on Wednesday. 
  The lira has recovered by 22.5 percent since April 7 when 
the 
lira/dollar parity peaked at 40,000. Its losses against the 
dollar have amounted to 82.3 percent this year. 
  Thousands of individuals lined up in front of bank branches 
from 4 a.m. Thursday to buy three-month government papers 
carrying an annual compound rate of 406 percent. 
  The three-month net rate on the same Treasury bills was an 
all-time high 50 percent, compared with only 32.5 percent in the 
previous auction. 
  All of the TL20 trillion papers were sold out by 2.30 p.m. 
on 
Friday, Treasury sources said. 
  The Treasury will make payments worth TL58 trillion during 
June to finance domestic debt repayments and public sector 
salaries. 
  In 31 different auctions, it has raised a total of TL34.511 
trillion this year, but cancelled nine auctions. 
  Following a government decision to cover all savings 
deposits 
under full state insurance, the banks have tended to raise both 
deposit and lending rates. 
  Presently, annual rates on three-month, six-month, and 
one-year accounts range from 135 to 160 percent. 
  Experts say the banks have been flooded with fresh funds 
after the decision. 
  "After the government gave assurances on savings deposits, 
the deposit volume has doubled," said Ismet Alver, general 
manager of Tekstilbank. 
  Bankers said high rates will be maintained as long as the 
Treasury remains short of cash and the monetary authorities 
insist on defending the national currency with the interest 
instrument. 
  "We shall work with high rates for some time to come. 
Otherwise, money will flow into foreign currencies, pushing up 
the exchange rates," said Hamit Belli, board chairman and chief 
executive officer at the private-owned Turkish Bank. During a 
summit Thursday, held under the auspices of the Turkish Banks 
Association, the banks did not reach a gentlemen's agreement on 
interest rates. 
  "We postponed talks to an unknown date. There was no 
agreement as to what the interest rate ceiling should be," said 
one banker who attended the summit. 
  Businessmen are worried. 
  "The latest rates on Treasury bills are incredible and may 
create endless fear. This will worsen the economic crisis," 
said a statement from Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul 
Chamber of Commerce (ITO). 
  He pointed out that the Treasury came forward with the 400 
percent interest rate exactly on the day when the bankers had 
gathered to discuss a reduction in interest rates. "This is 
ignorance," Sahinoglu said. 
  There were reports from the Istanbul Chamber of Industry 
that 
capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry dived from 
82.5 percent in April 1993 to 69.9 percent in April this year.

CSO 

  [Excerpt] Ankara (DUNYA)--The financial cost of the 
Economic Stabilization Program announced on 5 April will be 
300.7 trillion Turkish lira [TL]. This was announced yesterday 
by Social Democratic Populist Party [SHP] leader Murat 
Karayalcin during an Assembly group meeting in Ankara. 
  According to Karayalcin, the TL330.7 trillion will be 
derived 
thusly: TL70 trillion from tax reforms, TL204 trillion from 
increases, and TL58.1 trillion from other reforms. By "other 
reforms," Karayalcin stated he means the elimination of the 
nonproductive work sector, collection of back taxes, and 
avoidance of penalties. Karayalcin described the distribution of 
the total cost to the public sectors as follows: (a) wage and 
salaried sector (7.2 million people) 27.5 percent (TL91.1 
trillion); (b) agricultural sector (8.5 million people) 14.2 
percent (TL47.1 trillion); and (c) capital sector (8 million 
people) 58.2 percent (TL192.5 trillion). 
  The breakdown of the wage and salaried sector cost is as 
follows: (a) TL16.6 trillion from tax reforms; (b) TL54.9 
trillion from increases; (c) TL19.6 trillion from other reforms. 
The breakdown of the agricultural sector cost is as follows: 
(a) TL3.1 trillion from taxes; (b) TL38.9 trillion from 
increases; (c) TL7.1 trillion from other reforms. The breakdown 
of the capital sector is as follows: (a) TL90.3 trillion from 
taxes; (b) TL112.8 trillion from increases; (c) TL29.4 trillion 
from other reforms. 
  Karayalcin noted the following concerning the Council of 
Ministers' new TL70 trillion tax reform package issued the 
previous day: (a) additional tax revenues TL13.9 trillion; (b) 
additional enterprise taxes TL10.1 trillion; (c) net tax credits 
TL29-30 trillion. Karayalcin said that the Council of Ministers 
had adopted the principle of deriving taxes not just from 
transportation, real estate, and other taxables, but also from 
transfers, whichever was higher. He described the distribution 
of the burden among the various sectors as unequal, but he said 
that the inequality was targeted not at any participating sector 
but at capital in general. Karayalcin thanked Motherland Party 
leader Mesut Yilmaz and Democratic Left Party leader Bulent 
Ecevit for supporting the Stabilization Program, and he asked 
for the support of his own Assembly group in order to get the 
tax reform package through the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
[TBMM]. He also stressed the need for quick approval of the 
Radio and Television bill currently on the Assembly's agenda. 
  Karayalcin further stated that the state enterprise closings 
will only take effect at the end of the year. Since there is no 
decision on firing workers, it is possible that only those who 
work at nonprofitable enterprises will lose their jobs. 
Karayalcin stressed that the government's first priority is to 
find ways to return these enterprises to profitability. Noting 
that at Zonguldak those working above the ground outnumber those 
working in the mines, Karayalcin said that efforts are being 
expedited to create new jobs for 21,000 people in the region.

<F P=106> [Report by Evren Deger: "Problems in the Trillions-Worth </F>
Wireless Communication Systems Project"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The General Staff has ordered that the 
acquisition of the HF/SSB wireless communication systems, which 
are manufactured in Turkey under the plan to modernize the 
Turkish Armed Forces, be suspended. It has been reported that 
General Ahmet Corekci, deputy chief of the General Staff, has 
issued an order on behalf of Gen. Dogan Gures, chief of the 
General Staff, suspending the acquisition of the wireless 
communication systems because they do not meet the needs of the 
Armed Forces. Consequently, the military forces have rejected 
the systems, which are manufactured by the British Marconi Firm 
and its Turkish partners, Cihan Electronics Company and Elit 
Electronics Firm, in accordance with the contract they signed in 
1990. 
  The Armed Forces acquired 919 communication systems under 
the 
project, which will cost 4.8 trillion Turkish lira. However, 
considering the problems in the systems, Gen. Corekci, acting on 
behalf of Gen. Gures, suspended the acquisition of the units 
until further notice on 16 December 1993. The military sources 
and the officials of the Undersecretariat for the Defense 
Industry [UDI] have said that the acquisition of the systems has 
not yet been resumed and that talks are being held on the Armed 
Forces' problems. They also expressed the hope that the talks 
will yield results in a short time. 
  Gen. Corekci's order described the problems in the 
communication systems as follows: 
  "The 400-watt and 100-watt systems, which were installed in 
the facilities of the Ankara Regional Communications Unit 
Command, were observed to affect each other on various 
frequencies. Communications were distorted by interference. 
  "The tests that were later carried out to clarify the 
problem 
confirmed that the communication systems installed in the same 
facilities affected each other. Meanwhile, it was established 
that changing frequencies in the systems caused problems. 
  "Although the list of technical specifications and the 
contract for the manufacturing of the systems do not contain 
provisions indicating that the units may be installed and used 
close to each other, the operation of the HF/SSB wireless 
communication systems by the military requires it. 
  "It is believed that the manufacturing firm should consider 
that principle in manufacturing its systems. In view of that, 
the manufacturing firm should make the necessary modifications 
without any additional charge as soon as possible. Otherwise, 
the firm will be regarded as violating the principles of 
goodwill." 
  Gen. Corekci's order, which was conveyed to the UDI, listed 
the measures that should be taken to meet the needs as follows: 
  ``1. Every necessary arrangement must be made to prevent the 
wireless communication systems from affecting each other and to 
resolve the problems related to frequency changes. 
  ``2. The acquisition procedures for the systems, which have 
been tested and stored in depots, will not be finalized until 
the existing problems are resolved. 
  ``3. Furthermore, acquisition tests and the final 
acquisition of the systems will be suspended until the 
manufacturing firm's modifications are approved by the Armed 
Forces. 
  ``4. The modifications to eliminate the problems must not 
change the performance of the systems. 
  ``5. The military units will continue to use the wireless 
communication systems, which are already on the Armed Forces' 
inventory. However, the manufacturing firm will make the 
necessary modifications in them as soon as the work on resolving 
the problems is concluded.''

  [Text] Seven terrorists were killed in clashes with 
security forces in Batman's Beseri and Siirt's Kurtalan and 
Baykan Districts and on Gabar Mountain near Sirnak. Four 
terrorists, one of them a foreigner, surrendered to the security 
forces in a bid to benefit from the repentance law. 
  Sixteen members of the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization, who were trained in Greece in 
explosives and sabotage actions and who were planning to 
undertake actions in tourist centers in the Aegean region, were 
captured in Izmir along with their weapons. The terrorists 
arrived in Turkey from Greece aboard boats. The three boats 
they used, one of them a speedboat, were confiscated. 
  The separatist organization's foreign courier and its 
regional leader are among those caught as a result of a series 
of operations conducted by the Izmir Security Directorate 
antiterror units. In their interrogation, the terrorists 
confessed that they were trained in explosives and sabotage at a 
PKK camp in Greece. It was said that they were caught at a time 
when they were awaiting orders to begin actions in order to 
undermine Turkish tourism. Noting that they provided personnel 
for the terrorist organization's cadres in the mountains, the 
terrorists explained that they conducted work in Izmir's 
Yamanlar Mountain for a camp to be used temporarily for entering 
and leaving the country. Searches of the terrorists' houses and 
their persons yielded one Kalashnikov automatic rifle, two 
pistols, magazines and ammunition for these weapons, two sticks 
of dynamite, and large quantities of documents and action plans. 
The 16 terrorists were referred to the Izmir State Security 
Court.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "We Need Some Sincerity From the </F>
Congress"] 
  [Text] There is a growing Western offensive against Turkey 
on the lack of human rights in our country. We have warned 
numerous times in the past that Turkey's human rights record is 
dismal and that those in power have to do something urgently to 
correct this situation. The authorities have preferred to turn 
a deaf ear to our warnings, and we have reached a stage where 
Turkey can no longer pretend to be a select member of the 
community of civilized nations and still fail to take action to 
correct its human rights image. 
  Recently the American Congress joined the Western offensive, 
linking U.S. aid to Turkey to human rights and the Cyprus 
question. We feel this is very mistaken. 
  Cyprus is not only a very sensitive subject for Turks but it 
is also a national issue, and any external pressures, especially 
from the American Congress, will only sharpen the feeling of 
Turks that they are unjustly being persecuted. 
  This coupling of Cyprus with human rights will only be 
counter-productive, even for those of us who are trying to 
promote human rights in Turkey. People will feel we are 
cooperating with those who are trying to force concessions on 
Cyprus, under the guise of talking about human rights. We are 
the ones who complain about the lack of human rights. Yet we 
also would like to remind our friends on Capital Hill that human 
rights in Turkey does not only mean Kurdish rights, but the 
rights of all the citizen of the Turkish Republic who are facing 
repression and intimidation. 
  The citizens of Turkey are facing serious hardships in the 
midst of a guerrilla war, and those living in the western areas 
of the country often see their rights being violated, even 
though they do not live in the trouble spots.... 
  We feel that people on Capital Hill should show sincere 
concern about human rights and the lack of freedoms in Turkey, 
and set aside Cyprus and Kurdish rights. There are writers who 
go to jail simply for expressing their views. There are people 
who disappear while in custody. This happens in major cities, 
not in the Kurdish-dominated trouble spots of southeastern 
Turkey. 
  If the congressmen stop using Cyprus and eliminate a degree 
of bias, then their actions to promote human rights in Turkey 
will take on a more sincere dimension. 
  We are aware that friends of Turkey abroad are also hard 
pushed to defend our country, in view of its unfavorable human 
rights image. It is about time we started doing something 
ourselves to eliminate these deficiencies in our democracy and 
take our rightful place among the community of civilized nations.

<H5>  "Talabani's Design" </H5>
  Fighting has continued in northern Iraq for many weeks. The 
supporters of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud 
Barzani and those of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal 
Talabani have been engaged in violent clashes. The fighting 
broke out in a small area. It assumed a violent nature very 
quickly. 
  The U.S. officials, who are very influential in the region, 
belatedly decided to take action last week. They suggested to 
Talabani, who has been living in Damascus and making no effort 
to end the clashes in northern Iraq, that he "should go to the 
region and halt the incidents as soon as possible." Talabani 
responded by asking them to provide him with a helicopter 
because he had to cross through territory under Barzani's 
control. He stressed that he did not wish to do that. 
  However, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs received 
reports that the area Talabani mentioned was not sealed off by 
Barzani's men. In fact, several of Talabani's assistants left 
Damascus and crossed through that territory to reach their area. 
Considering that state of affairs, the U.S. officials rejected 
Talabani's request. 
  The situation that has emerged in northern Iraq is as 
follows: "Syria is supporting Talabani against Barzani in the 
clashes. Talabani seems to have urged Damascus to increase 
Syria's military and political support for his supporters.... 
As far as I am able to see, Talabani and Barzani mostly differ 
on matters related to northern Iraq's future. Barzani supports 
the idea of a federation or a confederation with Baghdad. In 
other words, he supports Iraq's territorial integrity. However, 
Talabani wishes to establish an independent Kurdish State." 
  The approach maintained by the two Kurdish leaders will 
force 
Turkey to willingly or unwillingly side with Barzani. Talabani 
is either unaware of that state of affairs or he is convinced 
that he stands to gain more by cooperating with Syria.... He 
may be planning to use Syria when the situation returns to 
normal in the region as a result of a peace agreement between 
Syria and Israel. 
  Nevertheless, Turkey has not intervened in the fighting 
between the two sides. That was the right thing to do. The 
United States is expected to intervene in the situation in the 
near future. A very high-ranking foreign ministry official has 
said that "Turkey has to maintain a wise policy." 
  Considering the developments in northern Iraq, I wish to 
criticize those who defend the view that the "Hammer Force must 
immediately withdraw from Turkey." I do not know what else I 
should say. 
<H5>  Question of Iran </H5>
  Let us consider the developments that took place during the 
Iranian delegation's visit to Ankara a few days ago: 
  1. The Iranian officials explained the anxiety the 
developments in northern Iraq have caused in Iran.... They 
conveyed a verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to 
President Suleyman Demirel on Iran's uneasiness. 
  22. President Demirel and the foreign ministry officials 
informed the Iranian officials that Turkey is worried by Iran's 
approach on matters related to the activities of the Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK]. The Iranian officials said that their 
country has been trying to do everything it can on the matter. 
They called for coordination between the two sides. The 
framework of such a coordination is unknown. However, the two 
countries can cooperate through the Turkish-Iranian Security 
Committee. 
  23. The delegation did not propose joint intervention in 
northern Iraq by Turkey and Iran. 
  24. The Iranian officials said that their country is 
opposed to the establishment of an independent Kurdish State in 
northern Iraq. The Turkish officials said that they shared that 
view. 
  25. The Iranian officials said that they were worried by 
the possibility that Talabani may emerge stronger against 
Barzani as a result of the clashes in northern Iraq. The 
Turkish officials responded by saying that Turkey and Iran 
should wait until the situation becomes clear in a few months.... 
  That is how the Iranian delegation's meetings in Turkey can 
be summed up.... The Iranians seem to prefer to visit Turkey to 
express certain views that otherwise could be conveyed through 
telephone calls. Apparently, frequently traveling to foreign 
countries seems to be attractive to them. 
<H5>  Someone Is Provoking </H5>
  Several people seem to have disrupted the relations between 
Turkey and the United States. In fact, they have been making an 
intensive effort to achieve their objective in Washington. A 
number of them have an "official capacity." 
  The U.S. Congress' Helsinki Commission on Human Rights has 
been convinced to focus on the Kurdish problem in an 
unprecedented way during the past few months. Unfortunately, it 
has failed to discriminate between the PKK and the Kurdish 
problem. 
  Speaking at a meeting that was held two days ago, the 
members 
of the International Human Rights Legal Committee made horrible 
accusations against Turkey, in spite of the fact that they 
visited Ankara to study the situation for only four days. 
Kathryn Porter, wife of Republican Congressman John Porter, 
addressed that meeting. She claimed that she was treated in an 
unbelievable way in Turkey, which she described as a police 
state and a country in which democracy does not exist. 
Furthermore, she said that the situation in Diyarbakir was 
worse than that in the former Soviet Union. She also claimed 
that several of the people who accompanied her were killed and 
that she was harassed by officials. 
  Kathryn Porter is not a new name for Turkey.... She 
maintains a hostile attitude toward the Turks. In fact, she 
traveled to south Cyprus and encouraged the Greek Cypriot women 
to march against the Turkish Cypriot border some time ago. She 
appeared in many photographs at the time. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has to realize the harm that is 
being done to the relations between Turkey and the United States 
by individuals who maintain hostile feelings against the Turks. 
In fact, the U.S. Embassy has to take measures against them.... 
The matter is not a joke. It must be considered seriously. 
  Turkey is not a colony.... The U.S. ambassador in Ankara 
must immediately explain that to Washington.... It seems that 
the individuals who address the commissions of the U.S. Congress 
are selected very carefully.... Ambassador Barkley, you must 
end that state of affairs. Mr. Ambassador, have I made myself 
clear?

<F P=106> [Interview with European Parliament President Egon Klepsch </F>
by Elmar Oberhauser in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Oberhauser] President Klepsch, I do not want to 
hurt you as a guest, but many people -- not only opponents of 
the European Union [EU] -- say that the European Parliament is a 
body without any power, a mere alibi institution. Are you the 
head of a toothless tiger? 
  [Klepsch] I think that this is an old prejudice that is 
about 10 or 12 years old. The people in question have not 
realized what has meanwhile changed in the European Union. They 
have not taken note of the Maastricht Treaty and its 
implementation. The European Parliament has received essential 
concessions to its political power. In the future, the EU 
Commission will be dependent on it. The European Parliament must 
appoint the Commission and it may dissolve it. It may check on 
it, and it will do so. The European Parliament is involved in 
legislation, and all treaties with third parties that have 
political, economic, and financial importance must be ratified 
by the European Parliament. 
  [Oberhauser] Nevertheless, I would like to stick to my 
previous question. Of course, you must defend the Parliament, 
but is it not true that, in reality, decisions are made in the 
Commission and in the Council -- that is, far away from 
Parliament? 
  [Klepsch] No, this is really not the case. Ever since I 
have held this office, we have had the so-called prelogue, this 
is, the Council president, the Commission president, and I 
myself meet at least once a month to discuss the pending 
decisions, and the Parliament is quite involved within the 
framework of the treaty. This is also assured by the Court of 
Justice, which we can turn to if the treaty is not observed. 
  [Oberhauser] In the period coming up to the referendum on 12 
June, Austrian television is airing the so-called Europa-Forum. 
Yesterday's Europa-Forum was watched by almost 2 million people 
in Austria. This broadcast gave rise to 370 telephone calls -- 
people, callers, who wanted to know details. Here one of the 
major issues was the question of participating in 
decisionmaking, that is, the great uncertainty whether a small 
country like Austria actually has any way to have its say in 
this Parliament and in the European Union. 
  [Klepsch] The EU member states all have the same rights, and 
the same goes for the deputies. Of course, in the Parliament it 
will be of decisive importance which groups the Austrian 
deputies join and how these groups exert their influence. 
  I can only tell you that the two large groups, the socialist 
group and the group of the European People's Party, which have 
had contact with observers from Austria for quite some time, are 
very interested in seeing a contribution by the Austrian 
deputies, because the tradition of Austria's democratic 
structures is an advantage for us. 
  [Oberhauser] Let us assume that this referendum will have a 
positive result and Austria will join the European Union. Then 
Austria will have about 20 or 25 deputies in this 600-person 
Parliament. 
  [Klepsch] Correct. 
  [Oberhauser] How are they supposed to participate in 
decisionmaking? Are you not throwing a bit of sand into the 
Austrians' eyes? 
  [Klepsch] In this Parliament, decisions are made with the 
absolute majority of the legal number of members. No country 
has a majority there. All of them are far from a majority. 
  [Oberhauser] But there are big and small countries, are 
there not? 
  [Klepsch] There are big and small countries, but there are 
also big and small groups, and it depends on the material 
contributions of the individual deputies, because in the 
European Parliament the most important persons are the 
rapporteurs, who know specific issues very well and whom their 
groups follow. It is a question of the reputation that these 
people enjoy, and I am firmly convinced that Austria will send 
qualified deputies, who will have an important say in their 
respective groups. 
  [Oberhauser] This is the catch-word, and I do not want to 
link my next question with any specific names or persons and 
certainly not with any specific Austrians. On 12 June, new 
elections for the European Parliament will also be held. As 
president of this Parliament, do you not have -- at least to a 
certain extent -- the problem that the European Parliament is 
increasingly becoming the side-track for parliamentarians who 
are not successful in their homelands anymore? 
  [Klepsch] Precisely the opposite is true. It may have been 
true at the beginning, when the deputies were sent to the 
European Parliament by the national parliaments, depending on 
their services and their reputation. Nowadays, however, the 
deputies are elected directly, and they must face an election 
and, above all, they must campaign for votes. This is possible 
only if they make it clear that they have the competence to 
fulfill their tasks. I am not worried at all. We will have a 
great renewal of the Parliament. More than 50 percent of the 
deputies will be new in Parliament. This is a great 
restructuring, but I think it is necessary, because the change 
in generations that is taking place in the member countries 
everywhere will also gain shape here. 
  [Oberhauser] As I said before, the referendum in Austria 
will be held in less than 14 days. The result will be narrow, 
as many people have been assuming over the past few days. What 
would happen, President Klepsch, if the referendum in Austria 
resulted in a no? Would this lead to a reaction by the European 
Union along the line of: Well, then let them stay where they 
are, or would this have other consequences? 
  [Klepsch] I think the former will be the consequence, 
because it is clear that the question about a long period of 
negotiations, during which 12 countries were persuaded to agree 
to the conditions that the Austrians posed -- and the 
negotiations were very tough.... [sentence incomplete as heard] 
If one now rejects these -- well, there are enough other 
would-be members. I think that, at the moment, we have another 
six applications for membership on our table, who would get 
priority if the Austrians say no. However, I do not believe 
that this will happen. I trust the Austrians. 
  [Oberhauser] Are you an opinion researcher? 
  [Klepsch] No, I am not an opinion researcher, but I have a 
number of friends and acquaintances here in Austria, and I get 
the impression that they are clear-headed enough to think of our 
future, of our common future, which we can only cope with 
together. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. President, is this attitude of: Well, then 
let them stay where they are, not an enormously arrogant 
position? Since you spoke of democracy and responsibility 
before, should it not also be in the interest of the European 
Union to create a really united Europe -- and this would include 
all, the Austrians, the Swiss, and, at some time in the future, 
also the former Eastern Bloc? 
  [Klepsch] Of course, the Swiss have already applied for 
membership. They just do not want to negotiate about it at the 
moment, because the Swiss Government, the Swiss parties, do not 
know how to push through the results of the negotiations because 
of the Swiss Constitution. However, they have not withdrawn 
their application. They know that they have to work together 
with us. They are all welcome, but the precondition for them all 
is that they are a liberal rule-of-law state, that they have a 
pluralist democratic system, a market economy system with a 
social basis, and that they are willing to share equal rights 
and duties with the others. These are the preconditions for 
entering the European Union, and Austria is a country that would 
be welcome. 
  [Oberhauser] You elegantly evaded my question just now. 
Even if the referendum were to end negatively, should it not 
also be in the interest of the European Union to have -- let us 
stay with Austria -- Austria in it, even if, at the moment, the 
people are of a different view? 
  [Klepsch] Well, fine, but one has to see that there is a 
certain sequence to the events. We have to take another step in 
the European Union. In 1996 we will discuss the further 
progress of the European Union, and there is the question of 
whether Austria will be with us and discuss the matters together 
with us, or whether it wants to negotiate membership afterwards, 
under the new conditions. The second thing that one has to see 
is that there are many other countries that want to join and 
that will discuss their application for membership before 
Austria. 
  [Oberhauser] One question in conclusion: If the referendum 
results in a yes on 12 June, as you expect, will you then be 
able to stick to the schedule of joining the European Union on 1 
January 1995? I am thinking of the ratification in the 12 
member countries, which is necessary. 
  [Klepsch] Well, as regards Austria, I think that this is 
very likely and possible. I have inquired about the 
preparations in Germany, for instance. They have a complicated 
Constitution, as some other member states, but the schedule of 
the Bundestag and the Bundesrat is sufficient to achieve the 
goal in December. 
  [Oberhauser] Thank you very much for visiting us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Martin Pollack </F>
and Olaf Ihlau in Vienna; date not given: "Joy in Complaining"] 
  [Excerpt] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chancellor, what is Austria 
getting as a result of membership in the European Union [EU] -- 
more unemployment, more foreigners, a sell out of real estate, 
and meat contaminated with hormones? 
  [Vranitzky] None of the above is the most important thing. 
One cannot rule out that one thing or the other might happen 
occasionally. Occasionally we have found bad meat in our shops 
even without EU membership. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We are just quoting a few provocative 
catchwords used by Austrian EU opponents, who hope to triumph in 
the referendum on 12 June. 
  [Vranitzky] I believe that these catchwords are 
characterizing the domestic discussion about the EU rather 
precisely. When we concluded our negotiations with Brussels on 
1 March, the major issues were primarily agriculture, the 
budget, second homes, and the transit agreement. However, the 
more political the discussion becomes, the more emotional topics 
and slogans are coming to the surface. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] "Austria first" your right-wing populist Joerg 
Haider demands. 
  [Vranitzky] This is precisely where we are now. In the 
remaining days until the referendum we must draw a clear line 
between the political goal, which is the issue, and the slogans 
to create uncertainty and fear. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Most recent poll results signal a narrow 
result. Is Europe no longer attractive in Austria? 
  [Vranitzky] I expected the mood to go down after the 
euphoria 
at the beginning of March. One cannot constantly be under such 
high tension. In 1993 we had a pronounced recession. Many 
people say that European integration is to be blamed for that. 
Others are worried about the situation in ex-Yugoslavia and 
say: Look at the EU, it is not even able to make peace. Others 
still say: In our country the unemployment rate is 5.5 percent, 
which is not even half as high as the EU average -- why do you 
now want to push us in there? We need an enormous effort to 
explain matters and to convince people. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Some people, not just Haider, also think that 
your government should have gotten more out of the membership 
negotiations in Brussels or should have waited for a more 
favorable time. 
  [Vranitzky] It is simply not true that we have not achieved 
enough. [Bavarian] Minister President Stoiber recently told me 
that he does not know at all how he should explain to Bavarian 
farmers that the Austrians got far more for their farmers in the 
mountain regions, e.g. regarding EU aid for environmental 
protection. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At least, you also got a concession in 
Brussels 
that in the future you may continue to use specific Austrian 
terms for certain foodstuffs. 
  [Vranitzky] We are also rather proud of that, but this is 
not 
the only thing. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will the referendum be repeated if the vote is 
negative, as it was in Denmark in 1992? 
  [Vranitzky] I do not believe that the referendum will be 
negative. However, we would then certainly face a serious 
situation, both in terms of domestic policy and in terms of 
European policy. And we would certainly not resign ourselves to 
the fact that the European issue is dead once and for all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For Austria, EU membership is the most 
important historical event since it regained sovereignty through 
the State Treaty of 1955. However, is not also a de facto 
annexation to a greater Germany under different conditions, 
which would have been horrible for your predecessor Bruno 
Kreisky? 
  [Vranitzky] I think that it will be precisely the opposite 
that will happen. Let us look at the economy, at foreign 
trade.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...two-thirds of which you conduct with the EU 
anyway. 
  [Vranitzky] Quite so. Now the EU is moving closer together, 
and anyone who stays outside will be at a disadvantage. What 
would be the alternative? We would have to come to a bilateral 
agreement with our strongest trading partner, namely Germany. 
Thus, we would be all the more dependent. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Some francophone members of the European 
Parliament already see Austria as a "vassal" of the Germans. 
Will the EU become more northern, not to say more Germanic, 
because of the accession of the four new members? 
  [Vranitzky] Let me tell you a little story: When I visited 
the French president in summer 1989, that is, before the fall of 
the Berlin Wall, Mitterrand told me: Well, you are very welcome 
to us, and I take note of the fact that the third German state 
will join the EU. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Did you protest against this classification? 
  [Vranitzky] I told Mitterrand: Dear friend, I do not 
represent the third German state, but the first and only 
Austrian state. He quickly said that he did not mean any harm 
by saying this. One or the other person might feel the same 
today. But we are all old European states with long common 
relations. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Bonn's Foreign Minister Kinkel was 
particularly 
supportive of Austria during the membership negotiations -- do 
you not feel a bit that you owe him something? 
  [Vranitzky] Kinkel supported us just as much as Belgium's 
Willy Claes, as [EU Commission President] Jacques Delors during 
the final state, and he cooperated just as much as Spain's 
Gonzalez. Perhaps one should also respect the different 
temperaments. Kinkel's temperament is different from that of 
France's Balladur. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What will happen to the permanent neutrality 
of Mozart's country after it joins the EU? You seem to shy away 
from definite statements in this respect. 
  [Vranitzky] Neutrality has really been strained by too many 
comparisons, just as Mozart has been. Neutrality is a legal and 
not a political instrument; probably only Austrians really 
understand that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We are obviously talking about a sacred cow? 
  [Vranitzky] You know, from the end of the 19th century to 
1955, this country was constantly shaken, trampled on, and 
abused, certainly also because of its own actions. The State 
Treaty in 1955, after 10 years of occupation, and the neutrality 
that was adopted by the Austrian Parliament finally meant 
stability. Thus, the term neutrality is a very emotional one 
for us. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, in light of the new geopolitical 
realities in Europe, this is an increasingly dubious status. 
Even the neutral countries Sweden and Finland have meanwhile 
joined the NATO Partnership for Peace. Why does Austria not 
join, too? 
  [Vranitzky] I think the basic concept of neutrality, which 
is 
not to participate in wars, is not a bad principle. By joining 
the Partnership for Peace, the Swedes and the Finnish did not 
join a military alliance. This is a platform for information 
and training, something which we have long been doing with the 
countries of East Europe. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How does Austria want to contribute to a 
common 
European defense policy? 
  [Vranitzky] The establishment of a common security system is 
possible for a neutral state just as for any other state. And 
whether or not we have observer status in the Western European 
Union, we have said repeatedly: We are open in this respect. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But joining NATO is not possible? 
  [Vranitzky] No. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even though NATO is currently the only 
institution that effectively guarantees security in Europe? 
  [Vranitzky] For whom? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For everyone who joins in. 
  [Vranitzky] NATO membership is not a topic for us at the 
moment, not even in the medium term. However, if NATO rethinks 
its own future, one will have to examine later on what was the 
result of this rethinking. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For 1996, the EU is planning a large 
government 
conference to reform the European institutions. What should be 
reformed? 
  [Vranitzky] There are extensive debates in the EU about the 
so-called democractic deficit. We have established pluralistic 
parliamentary systems in our countries. In the long run, the 
peoples will not be willing to accept a decline in democracy 
policy at the next higher, the European level. This 
relationship between the European Parliament, the EU Commission, 
and the EU Council of Ministers will have to be institutionally 
clarified. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You see already now how the British, for 
instance, are blocking this. This will hardly be different in 
1996. 
  [Vranitzky] You are right. I have never said that this will 
be an easy task. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In addition, by deciding in favor of 
enlargement, the EU has, for the time being, decided against a 
deepening of supranational relations. 
  [Vranitzky] I reject this as regards Austria. The big 
problems of the future, such as the environment, stability, and 
peace cannot be solved on the basis of a free trade zone. This 
means I am a member of the school of the political union. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the war in Yugoslavia, West Europe has 
proved to be disunited and helpless. Would a common foreign 
policy with majority decisions in the Council make the EU more 
able to act? 
  [Vranitzky] In some fields the instrument of majority 
decision would ensure flexibility and efficiency. If one wants 
to prevent a disaster such as the one in the former Yugoslavia 
in the future, a common political will and, afterwards, common 
action are necessary. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Austria finds itself in a turbulent 
neighborhood: To the east of you former communists are on their 
way up again in many places; the civil war in the former 
Yugoslavia continues; and your Italian neighbors have the 
neofascists back in the government. Are you worried about the 
advance of extremism? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, but I am worried even more about the fact 
that many of my fellow citizens have noticed this very little so 
far. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] There we are back with Joerg Haider. 
  [Vranitzky] No, I am thinking of those who close their minds 
to new things, because they think that everything can continue 
as it was in the 1970's and 1980's. But the foreign policy 
framework conditions have changed. So far, we West Europeans 
have neglected helping the reform states in the East with models 
of cooperation and further improving their economic framework 
conditions with investments in infrastructure, technical 
knowledge, and administration. The lack of social and economic 
progress has led to many people being disinterested in these 
developments. But we must not turn away, we must not isolate 
these peoples -- this would be fundamentally wrong. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Peace researcher Johan Galtung sees what is 
happening in East Europe now as economic colonialism by the 
West, which is creating a second Third World there. 
  [Vranitzky] This threat is very real if we in the West do 
not 
pay more attention to it. I still hear what my former colleague 
Margaret Thatcher used to say, namely that, first of all, those 
in the East must develop free market economy systems and then, 
as soon as they have them, we will invest in their countries. I 
told her that this will not be possible without Western 
cooperation; no free markets will develop there, unless they are 
organized black markets. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will Austria get involved as an advocate for 
the acceptance of the reform states in the EU or do you rather 
see competition developing in this respect? 
  [Vranitzky] One must take the factor of time into 
consideration. The economic constellations in these countries 
show that immediate membership of the reform countries is not 
possible. Transition solutions, however, are certainly useful. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Austria, which has so far been relatively 
liberal, has also adopted stricter immigration laws, which are 
applied consistently, sometimes even brutally. You are closing 
your borders. Is this advance obedience for joining the 
fortress West Europe? 
  [Vranitzky] We were forced to adjust our legal situation to 
the fundamentally changed structure of migration in Central 
Europe within the shortest possible period. In individual 
cases, authorities have certainly acted improperly. And as 
regards dealing with people who come to us from other countries, 
we, like many other Europeans, are in the middle of a learning 
process. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Austrians are probably right in the 
European trend with their widespread aversion against foreigners. 
  [Vranitzky] I do not to downplay anything and I cannot deny 
what you are saying for every single case. However, one has to 
add that this is really a tough piece of political work that has 
to be done -- there, where concentrations are permitted or 
promoted, such as in some schools, where there are already 60 
percent are foreigners. This is were policy must become active. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is your government again permitting itself to 
be influenced by Mr. Haider? 
  [Vranitzky] No, Haider is not influencing anything. The 60 
percent of foreign children are in these school classes with or 
without Mr. Haider. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Tim Miles, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Excerpt] Iran is expelling a British diplomat from Tehran, 
the [British] Foreign Office said today. Britain's deputy head 
of mission, Hamish Cowell, had been asked to leave the country, 
a spokesman said. Iran gave no reason for what the spokesman 
described as an "unjustified" request, but the move appears to 
be a tit-for-tat response to Britain's expulsion of an Iranian 
diplomat last week. 
  The Foreign Office today for the first time officially 
confirmed that expulsion had been ordered and named the Iranian 
diplomat as first secretary Vahid Belourchi. He had been asked 
to leave because of false allegations about British policy in 
Bosnia. Members of the Iranian embassy in London had been 
distributing forged documents purporting to show Britain's 
policy in Bosnia was directed against Muslims, the spokesman 
said. 
  Until today the Foreign Office would only confirm that a 
meeting had taken place last Thursday [26 May] between Foreign 
Office Minister Douglas Hogg and Iran's charge d'affaires in 
London, Gholamreza Ansari. Diplomatic sources said the Foreign 
Office's refusal to confirm the expulsion was aimed at trying to 
forestall a tit-for-tat move by Iran. 
  The Foreign Office would not say today whether Britain would 
respond further. "We will keep the situation under review. We 
are looking at it very closely at the moment," the spokesman 
said. He confirmed the expelled Iranian diplomat had not yet 
left the country but said there were no signs that Iran was 
dragging its feet. 
  Mr Cowell was not expected to be packing his bags yet 
either. 
"His departure would not necessarily be immediate," the 
spokesman said. Yesterday, Mr Cowell himself referred inquiries 
from PRESS ASSOCIATION News about the possibility of reprisals 
against British diplomats in Tehran to the Foreign Office news 
department in London. 
  Although Iran gave no official reason for the move, the 
Iranian news agency IRNA quoted a radical Iranian newspaper 
which accused Britain of launching a propaganda offensive in the 
country. [passage omitted]

Germany, according to FOCUS magazine. Moscow is demanding the 
restitution of at least 1,200 buildings and plots of land, 
including prime sites in the most expensive areas of Berlin, 
Dresden, and Leipzig. More than 100 sites were legally acquired 
in the 1950's by the Soviet Foreign Trade Office.

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Gautier: "Franco-German Tandem for </F>
Europe"] 
  [Text] Mulhouse -- "France and Germany will be responsible 
for the presidency of the European Union [EU] in succession 
until June 1995. I think that we should link our work to give 
the impression that there will be a common presidency, or at 
least a continuous presidency, for 12 months." 
  The remark was made yesterday by Francois Mitterrand during 
the press conference held during the 63d Franco-German summit in 
Mulhouse. Sitting at his side, Chancellor Kohl confirmed: "We 
intend to work with the French to ensure that our two terms as 
president turn into one period of 12 months." 
  The two heads of state and of government thus clearly went 
further than French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur wished. The 
previous day the latter used a spokesman to describe the 
Franco-German tandem as a "dual presidency making it possible to 
link work over a year through joint operations and projects." 
Yesterday, Francois Mitterrand insisted: "Europe will never 
have experienced such a long period of continuity." 
  Paris and Bonn have already prepared for this term of office 
which starts on 1 July. For two days, the Franco-German 
partners reviewed the problems of security and stability in 
Europe, the problems of immigration, and the strengthening of 
Community institutions, the fight against unemployment, and 
economic recovery. 
  One of the high points of this meeting, which distinguished 
it from the "previous 62," according to Mr. Kohl, was the fact 
that the two "locomotives of Europe" wanted to settle the issue 
of the eastern and southeastern high-speed trains. 
  In reply to the impatience of the Central and East European 
countries which want to join the EU, Francois Mitterrand said: 
"I see no obstacle to speeding up the membership process for 
newcomers, provided the European rules are respected. There are 
no preset limits on European expansion." 
  But, both Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl stressed that 
"the important thing is that the interests of the candidates do 
not conflict with our achievements, and that Europe should make 
progress." 
  Anxious to stress this "harmony," Chancellor Kohl welcomed 
"the remarkable atmosphere of the Mulhouse summit. The problem 
with this type of consultation is that it often leads to nothing 
spectacular. But the sensational thing is precisely this 
normality in Franco-German relations within the framework of 
European developing European unity," he noted. 
<H5>  Musical Chairs </H5>
  This perfectly rehearsed duet also applied to the candidates 
for the mandates which are expiring in European and 
international organizations. With regard to the replacement of 
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, Francois 
Mitterrand explained: "The exchanges of views will continue 
until the Corfu summit (on 24 and 25 June -- LE FIGARO editor's 
note). We will probably be ready to support the same candidate 
after consultations with our 10 partners." The chancellor 
smiled knowingly. 
  European Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan will be nosed out by 
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. The British candidate 
could inherit the post of secretary general of the World Trade 
Organization, which will take over from GATT. Paris would 
apparently not oppose that. 
  Unless, members of the entourage of one French minister 
stressed, he insists on replacing Jean-Claude Paille, whose 
mandate as secretary general of the OECD is coming to an end. 
Paris would like Mr. Paille to be given another term of office. 
  This huge game of musical chairs is far from being settled. 
Another position to be allocated is that of secretary general of 
the Western European Union, and that of secretary general of 
NATO. 
  The Germans and French have drawn up a list of names with a 
view to the Corfu summit, while "avoiding giving the impression 
of imposing their candidates on the other Europeans," one of the 
French prime minister's advisers explained. 
  Far from these negotiations, the French president finally 
issued an invitation to Germany: "I announced today that I had 
the intention of inviting the European Army Corps to the 14 July 
celebrations. And, consequently, the German, Belgian, 
Luxembourg, and Spanish officials who are already part of or 
about to become part of the corps." Chancellor Kohl immediately 
"accepted" this invitation "with gratitude," indicating his 
intention of being present on the Champs-Elysees on France's 
national holiday.

<F P=106> [Gallup Institute article: "Voters in Doubt About Europe </F>
Election"] 
  [Text] Only 51 percent of the electorate have decided how 
they will cast their ballot on 9 June. The Liberals are well 
placed for a good result. 
  Barely four weeks before the election to the European 
Parliament on 9 June, the Gallup Institute conducted a poll for 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on current support for competing parties and 
their candidate lists. 
  The poll shows that every seventh eligible Danish voter is 
still not clear about the fact that an election is to be held 
for the European Parliament on 9 June. This is a remarkably 
large proportion of the population, and it must be expected that 
this will become significantly smaller when the vote placards go 
up and the campaign begins in earnest. 
<H5>  Every Third in Doubt </H5>
  Another interesting result of Gallup's poll is that every 
third voter (35 percent) is in doubt as to what he is voting 
for. At the same time, every 11th voter (9 percent) has already 
decided not to vote on 9 June. This proportion can be expected 
to rise somewhat. In any case, the three previous European 
Parliament elections have had very low voting percentages. At 
the present juncture, every second voter (51 percent) has 
decided how he is going to cast his ballot, and -- viewing the 
vote distribution among this half of the electorate -- one sees 
several clear tendencies. 
<H5>  Liberal Party Ahead </H5>
  In comparison to the last European Parliament election, the 
Liberals are in position to have a good election, with 28 
percent of the voters, while the Center Democrats (CD) look as 
if they will lose so many voters that the CD will get no seats 
in the new European Parliament. At present the Radical Liberals 
are poised to gain 6 percent, and if this result holds, then the 
party will have a possibility of getting its first seat in the 
European Parliament. The People's Movement Against the European 
Union [EU] is poised right now to lose two-thirds of its 
support, and got only 6 percent, while The June Movement [also 
opposed to the Union] would now get 9 percent among those who 
have made up their minds, and this means that this list 
currently has larger support than the People's Movement. 
Together these two anti-EU lists have support of only 15 percent 
of those who have made up their minds, which is less than many 
had expected. Gallup would like to emphasize, however, that this 
is a very early survey, so that the final vote result may turn 
out quite differently, since electoral alliances may play a 
role. In addition, many people are simply not aware there is 
going to be an election, and the election campaign has hardly 
started.

  [Text] In a lengthy report to the UN Security Council dated 
30 May that was finally circulated early this morning, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali makes the Security Council 
responsible for any decision on the procedure and substance of 
the effort to resolve the Cyprus issue. Despite the fact that 
Butrus-Ghali clearly blames the lack of an agreement on [Turkish 
Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas, the secretary general calls on the 
Security Council to study five choices that he proposes to deal 
with the situation in Cyprus. 
  Specifically, the secretary general, who considers the 
situation in Cyprus unsatisfactory, noted as the first 
alternative the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force from the 
island and its use elsewhere, because during the past 30 years 
it has been proven that there is no political will for a 
solution to the Cyprus problem. 
  The second alternative deals with the change of his mandate 
and the assumption of mandatory measures by the international 
community to force the intransigent side, as he put it, to be 
more flexible and cooperative in the negotiations on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The third alternative suggests a return to the substance of 
the Cyprus issue, specifically to the secretary general's Set of 
Ideas. 
  In his fourth alternative, Butrus-Ghali asks for time to 
consult with the Security Council members, the guarantor powers, 
the two leaders in Cyprus, and others so that he will have the 
flexibility to examine alternatives with significant 
consequences. 
  Finally, the fifth alternative is based on the fact that the 
two sides have accepted the package of confidence-building 
measures in principle and calls on the international community 
to repeat its efforts to achieve an agreement on the 
implementation of the measures. 
  Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali proposes various ways to approach 
the issue, including an international conference, a visit by a 
Security Council delegation to Cyprus and the region, or new 
visits by his special representative. However, the UN secretary 
general notes that the process thus far has convinced him that 
it is possible to achieve an agreement if there are new changes 
to the confidence-building measures. At the same time, he 
reaffirms his support for the measures. 
  In his report, Butrus-Ghali notes that the Security Council 
is again faced with a familiar scenario, that is, no agreement 
mainly because of the lack of political will on the Turkish 
Cypriot side and warns that its way of thinking will have 
serious consequences for the Turkish Cypriot community's 
prosperity. 
  The report also says that the UN secretary general 
categorically denies the Turkish claim that the original 
document on the confidence-building measures of 1 July has been 
improved for the benefit of the Greek Cypriots. The secretary 
general proceeds with an analytical comparison of each aspect of 
the two documents of 1 July and 21 March. In addition, he 
submits the two maps of Nicosia Airport and Famagusta. 
  According to the CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
correspondent in New York, the Security Council is expected to 
begin deliberations by the end of the week so it can issue a 
resolution.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jalal Talabani, Patriotic Union of </F>
Kurdistan leader, by Mehmet Ali Birand in Damascus for the "32d 
Day" program -- live; in English with simultaneous Turkish 
translation] 
  [Text] [Birand] We are receiving reports that forces 
belonging to Mas'ud Barzani have captured the Halabjah area and 
that your forces are withdrawing. Are these reports correct? 
  [Talabani] No, they are not correct. Barzani's forces are 
being supported by Iran, and for this reason they captured 
Halabjah. 
  [Birand] So, actually Iranians captured Halabjah. Is that 
correct? 
  [Talabani] Forces belonging to Islamic Action, Hezbollah, 
and 
the KDP [Kurdish Democratic Party] have captured the Halabjah 
area with the support of Iran. 
  [Birand] Could you tell me your reasons for fighting 
Barzani? 
  [Talabani] There is no fighting right now. There was 
fighting four, five days ago. 
  [Birand] Yes, but you are saying that Islamic Movement 
forces 
and the Hezbollah are fighting against you. What do you think 
they want? 
  [Talabani] This was true four days ago. Is is not true now. 
Four days ago, they were fighting with Iran's support. There is 
no fighting right now. 
  [Birand] Turkey is trying to mediate between you and Mr. 
Barzani. Did you agree to meet Mr. Barzani, in Turkey or in 
some other place? 
  [Talabani] We welcome Turkish mediation and I am ready to 
meet Mr. Barzani. 
  [Birand] What do you ask in order to establish a cease-fire? 
What do you expect from Mr. Barzani? What do you want Turkey to 
tell him? 
  [Talabani] There are problems between Mr. Barzani and 
myself. 
We have to establish a cease-fire and pave the way for a 
political solution. 
  [Birand] Will you meet Mr. Barzani in Turkey? Do you know 
when you will meet him? 
  [Talabani] I will meet Mr. Barzani very soon. 
  [Birand] Who will not attend the meeting? Have you already 
agreed to come to Turkey? Is it Mr. Barzani who is postponing 
the meeting? 
  [Talabani] I think Mr. Barzani will arrive in Turkey in the 
coming days. 
  [Birand] Does that mean that in the next few days you two 
will meet in Turkey? 
  [Talabani] I do not have a clear idea. 
  [Birand] KDP officials say that you are in cooperation with 
the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Can you tell me why you 
are cooperating with the PKK? 
  [Talabani] I do not know who is saying these things. We are 
not cooperating with any forces. We trust our own people and 
our own forces. The Kurds know who those are who trust 
foreigners and foreign forces. 
  [Birand] We have received quite a number of reports 
regarding 
your cooperation with the PKK. We have reports that the PKK is 
more active in territories under your control. 
  [Talabani] I can give you an example. It has been possible 
for the people of the KDP around the Irbil area to capture 
(Badiras) under these good conditions. [sentence as heard] 
  [Birand] Don't you think that the PKK is gaining power in 
northern Iraq while you fight the KDP? 
  [Talabani] There is no PKK presence in our area. Perhaps, 
the PKK has a small camp outside Zhalah and this camp is full of 
women, children, and sick people. I am not aware of any other 
PKK presence. 
  [Birand] There are reports attesting to the PKK presence in 
northern Iraq. In conclusion, what do you think will be the 
outcome of your meeting with Mr. Barzani. Will there be a peace 
agreement? 
  [Talabani] I plan on coming to Turkey shortly and meeting 
with Mr. Barzani. 
  [Birand] I thank you very much, Mr. Talabani.

<F P=106> [Passages in quotation marks recorded] </F>
  [Text] There is an all out dispute between the ruling 
coalition and the opposition parties. Two questions are at the 
center of the dispute; the presence of neofascist ministers in 
the government and the chairmanships of the Senate committees. 
  Nicola Mancino has attacked the government bitterly and said 
that he sees the risk of an authoritarian tendency in Italy. 
Achille Occhetto, leader of the Party of the Democratic Left, 
has criticized President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro for giving the 
go-ahead to neo-fascist government ministers. Occhetto has also 
attacked Gianfranco Fini and said that the idea of changing 
Italy's borders is dangerous and typically fascist. 
  However, the bitterest dispute concerns the Senate 
committees. The elections of the chairmen of the committees are 
due to take place tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti reports: 
  [Masotti] Disputes and arguments are also raging within the 
ranks of the ruling coalition. The National Alliance, which is 
in dispute with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio over his 
refusal to postpone the Senate committee contest, is threatening 
to vote solely for its own candidates. 
  However, the main bone of contention is the setting up of a 
new opposition grouping, the Democratic Left, which withdrew 
from the mixed Senate group in order to make life more difficult 
for the ruling coalition. 
  [Libero Gualtieri, leader of the Democratic Left -- 
identified by screen caption] "The mixed group could not be a 
neutral group at the same time as being the arbiter of a 
political dispute." 
  [Masotti] This means that the numbers, which were precarious 
in the first place, have changed for the ruling coalition. The 
political positions in the Senate have now become more radical. 
The Northern League has vetoed the idea of having opposition 
group chairmen in charge of the watchdog committees and has also 
ruled out the proposal of Nicola Mancino. 
  [Francesco Tabladini, Northern League -- identified by 
screen 
caption] "Today the situation with this group which has been set 
up in order to manipulate the votes means that the political 
reality and our willingness to cooperate will need to be 
rethought." 
  [Masotti] Between the Northern League and Forza Italia there 
remains the dispute over the Senate Public Works and 
Telecommunications Committee, although Umberto Bossi and Silvio 
Berlusconi are negotiating to unblock the impasse. 
  [Enrico La Loggia, Forza Italia --identified by screen 
caption] "I am sure that the problems we have had because of 
certain stances which were taken up by the Northern League will 
be overcome very soon." 
  [Masotti] Tomorrow is the day of reckoning and agreements 
will be at best only limited. 
  [Giuliano Ferrara, minister for relations with parliament -- 
identified by screen caption] "Each party will vote for its own 
candidates and the best candidates will win."

  [Text] The only road to resolving the serious crisis in 
Rwanda is that of trying to find a political solution. Any 
military solution must be ruled out. Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino stated this when telling the Chamber of Deputies of the 
latest developments in the civil war in the African country. 
Martino said that Italy will continue to work for a peaceful 
solution under the aegis of the United Nations to stop the 
crisis from spreading to neighboring countries, starting with 
Burundi. 
  Martino announced that he will be sending Franco Rocchetta, 
deputy secretary for foreign affairs, to the African country 
within the next few days.

  [Text] The government move to secure the arrest and 
extradition of former SS captain Erich Priebke "was dictated by 
a repudiation, which has deep roots in our country, of crimes 
against humanity, of racism, and of anti-Semitism." The 
declaration was made by Prime Minister Berlusconi to two 
representatives from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi's 
Abraham Cooper and Simon Samuels, during a meeting at the prime 
minister's office. 
  Justice Minister Biondi gave assurances that the 
documentation asking for Priebke's extradition would be sent to 
Argentina within the next few days.

<F P=106> [Report on press conference by Foreign Minister Antonio </F>
Martino in Paris on 26 May: "Freeze Between Italy and France" 
-- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Paris -- [Italian] Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino was not reticent, and indeed dealt forcefully with the 
subject of the dispute sparked by [French President] 
Mitterrand's remarks and the Palazzo Chigi [Italian government 
seat] note. Martino arrived in Paris Wednesday evening [25 May] 
as the press agencies carried excerpts from the French 
president's interview with LA REPUBBLICA and four other European 
newspapers. He arrived in France for the first time in his 
capacity as Italian foreign minister, without the list of 
appointments that would be normal for someone representing a new 
government in a friendly and allied country. There was no 
bilateral meeting with his French counterpart, Alain Juppe. 
"Too little time," the diplomats explained. But there was 
enough time for him to say, 24 hours later, just before leaving, 
that the French chief of state's remarks were "unacceptable." 
We cannot remember a time when relations between Rome and Paris 
were so tense, ever since the two capitals have shared the same 
Europeanist ideals. It is worth starting the story at the end. 
When Martino -- having declined an invitation to the Elysee 
presidential palace for a reception for all the participants at 
the conference on stability in Europe (though according to 
diplomats, "he declined some time ago because there was not 
enough time") -- summoned reporters to a room in the UNESCO 
building. There were plenty of journalists there waiting to 
hear what had happened. The questions came thick and fast. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Did you discuss Mitterrand's remarks with 
Juppe? 
  [Martino] I thought about doing so, but I met with Juppe 
together with my counterparts from several other countries. And 
I did not want to embarrass him. In any case, he cannot 
consider himself responsible for statements made by Mitterrand. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So was there no official reply to 
Mitterrand? 
  [Martino] I think that the best answer to give to Mitterrand 
is that which he himself gave in 1981 when he decried as 
"unacceptable" the criticisms made of him over the presence of 
Communist ministers in the government that he had just 
appointed. So the remarks made by Mitterrand to a number of 
European newspapers are unacceptable to us. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So do you consider the presence of Communist 
and neo-fascist ministers in a European government equivalent? 
  [Martino] It is not a matter of equivalence. I am just 
saying that a chief of state of a friendly and allied country 
should refrain from commenting on the independent vote of 
another friendly and allied country. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Has any official step been taken vis-a-vis 
the Elysee Palace? 
  [Martino] Definitely not. After the Palazzo Chigi note, that 
would mean attributing greater importance to Mitterrand's 
statements. Which, by the way, are very strange. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But Mitterrand's remarks are not the only 
ones. Other countries have expressed suspicion of the new 
Italian Government. 
  [Martino] That is true of the press in several countries. 
But as far as governments are concerned, Mitterrand is an 
isolated instance. No other chief of state has made any such 
remark. 
  [LA REPUBLICAN] The Palazzo Chigi communique says that those 
remarks are attributable to French domestic political problems. 
Do you agree? 
  [Martino] I do not consider it scandalous to say that these 
remarks are a result of the pre-election climate in France. If 
we consider the distribution of the various critical statements 
made in France in our regard, most of them come from the 
Socialists, who are now having difficulties. They are easier to 
interpret from this viewpoint. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you not consider [National Alliance 
member] Mirko Tremaglia's election as head of the lower house 
foreign affairs committee a provocation to those abroad who have 
expressed fears about the presence of neo-Fascists in our 
government? 
  [Martino] No comment. I did not take part in the vote.

  [Excerpt] Milan -- "There is an international agreement 
against Italy which we cannot accept. There are too many people 
beyond the Alps who do not like our tricolor flag. However, we 
must let the French know that it is not up to them to decide on 
our foreign policy. As far as President Mitterrand is 
concerned, he would be better advised to be concerned about the 
agreements he has reached with the communist party, whose 
totalitarian ideology has been ruinous for the world." These 
words were uttered by [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi, who 
yesterday briefly relinquished his role as justice minister in 
order to speak from the platform at the Center Union Congress 
held in Turin. Biondi made it clear that he did not welcome the 
position adopted by the president of the French Republic. 
Furthermore, he suggested that some sort of international 
"conspiracy" against Italy's interests lurked behind the concern 
expressed by many European leaders over the presence of AN 
[National Alliance] members in Berlusconi's government. After 
sounding the alarm, the minister nevertheless praised the 
"firmness" displayed by his colleague [Foreign Minister] Antonio 
Martino, who in the last few days made a sharp retort against 
the head of the Elysee [French president's palace]. The liberal 
leader also shared the foreign minister's position in favor of 
"reviewing historical conditions with bordering countries in the 
former Yugoslavia." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Now Scalfaro Must Be </F>
Answerable"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [President] Scalfaro's challenge has sent 
shock waves through political circles. "I challenge anyone to 
prove that any former interior minister -- not only myself -- 
allocated a single lira outside institutional purposes," the 
president declared Sunday [29 May] in the library of the Oropa 
[northwest Italy] sanctuary. This was the first time that Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro had directly broached the Sisde case, the scandal 
in which the secret service's greedy treasurers have tried to 
implicate the chief of state. Scalfaro did not say that he 
never saw any money change hands; what he said was that he spent 
it all for the sake of the state, challenging anyone to prove 
the contrary. Now some people are applauding him for having 
spoken out so clearly, while others would like him to answer for 
what he said, demanding that he reveal exactly how the vast 
secret funds were spent. 
  The first to put this question to him was Gianfranco Fini, 
AN 
[National Alliance] leader. However, yesterday Fini 
backtracked, saying that he is not demanding Scalfaro's 
resignation nor that he give evidence on how he spent the money: 
"It is not he who must say how he spent it," he said, without, 
however, adding who should do so. As the MSI [Italian Social 
Movement] made this qualification, AN members issued peremptory 
demands to the president. Late yesterday morning Gustavo Selva, 
the new chairman of the lower house Constitutional Affairs 
Committee, stated his own opinion: "The chief of state's 
remarks cannot be called into question.... Nevertheless the 
president's evidence should be verified, since Parliament is 
entitled to know exactly for what institutional purposes Sisde's 
secret funds were spent." Two hours later former Sisde Director 
Luigi Ramponi, now an AN senator, renewed the demand: "It is 
necessary to prove now that the funds were used for 
institutional purposes...." 
  The watchword was: Scalfaro must explain. It was an 
extraordinarily consistent one, with even the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] making the same demand: We want a financial 
statement. The spokesman was Franco Bassanini, the 
constitutionalist, who judged Fini's response "reasonable." "It 
is perfectly possible that interior ministers used Sisde funds, 
albeit legitimately. Perhaps those funds were allocated to 
perform plastic surgery on some criminal who turned state's 
evidence and to enable him to engage in some activity to make a 
living. But Scalfaro must provide an explanation." What the 
PDS deputy disliked most was the reference to ministers already 
implicated in the scandal: "The most embarrassing thing is that 
what applies to Scalfaro may also apply to his predecessors. 
This means, then, that this documentation has not been 
destroyed and that it therefore exists, or at least that it did 
exist." This being so, according to Bassanini, there is only 
one way to examine whether the funds were administered properly: 
"To grant an independent authority the opportunity to check on 
the destination of the funds." 
  Very well, quipped Pierantonio Graziani of the the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party], but how can Scalfaro reveal it if the 
expenditure was confidential? "Since these were confidential 
funds used for equally confidential institutional purposes, 
should Scalfaro -- in order to maintain this confidentiality -- 
whisper the truth in Fini's and Bassanini's ear?" But the rude 
shock to the president's friends came with the statement from 
Raffaele Della Valle. Having conceded that "for the present" 
there is no "Scalfaro problem," Della Valle added Forza Italia's 
weight to the demands for explanations from the president: "The 
president's word cannot be called into question, but I do not 
believe that anyone is exempt from the obligation to provide, in 
the proper forums, fuller explanations of what he says."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Majority in Favor Is Still </F>
Holding"] 
  [Text] The referendum on membership in the European Union 
[EU] remains exciting to the last. The latest Gallup poll shows 
there are still 37 percent of Austrians who are undecided 
whether they should vote "yes" or "no" on 12 June. This is the 
highest proportion of undecided people that has ever existed for 
a political vote in Austria such a short time before the 
decision is made. 
  Nevertheless, the majority in favor of EU membership, which 
has been obvious for months, remains in effect: Two weeks 
before the European referendum, 50 percent of Austrians say they 
will vote "yes." In the interviews for the poll 36 percent said 
that they will vote "no." When asked about the referendum, 14 
percent say that they do not have any preference. 
  In its studies on the EU Gallup is asking additional 
questions concerning Austrians' certainty regarding their 
decisions. Most recently, the following findings were 
made: 

  -  In addition to the 14 percent whose voting behavior 
is "completely open," there are 10 percent who want to make a 
final decision only in the voting both and another 13 percent, 
who might still be persuaded one way or the other by arguments 
or events -- this means: During the last week one has to 
struggle for 37 percent (more than one out of three 
Austrians). 
  -  Another detailed Gallup analysis shows how exciting 
the race is: Of the 50 percent who will vote "yes," four-fifths 
say that they are "firmly decided." This means: At the moment, 
the government can rely only on 40 percent of definite "yes" 
votes for the time being. Among the opponents only about 
two-thirds are firmly determined to vote "no." Thus, Haider and 
company have only 23 percent of definite "no" votes. Says 
Professor Fritz Karmasin [of the Gallup Institute]: "At the 
moment any result is possible!" 

  In this poll, currently the most extensive one on EU 
membership in Austria (each week 1,000 personal interviews, 
representative for all of Austria -- plus 500 telephone 
interviews to show topical trends), Gallup also investigated the 
mood of Austrians two weeks before the EU decision. It is 
surprising that the mood of the population still seems to be 
clearly in favor of the EU, despite signs to the contrary. The 
details: -- A total of 54 percent of all Austrians believe 
that the referendum on 12 June will end in a "yes" -- only 16 
percent believe in a majority "no." 

  -  A total of 47 percent 
of Austrians believe that "positive effects" will dominate in 
case of EU membership. Only 37 percent primarily see negative 
effects. 
  -  However, only 30 percent of Austrians polled think 
shortly before the referendum that they are "well informed" -- 
particularly bad is the level of information among retirees (26 
percent), workers (25 percent), and Austrians with net incomes 
of less than 12,000 schillings. 

  In fact, despite the general approval for the EU of 50 to 36 
percent, EU rejection is becoming increasingly clear among the 
problematic target groups: 

  -  As many as 49 percent of people 
with wages below 12,000 schillings -- who are a particularly 
important group because of the high degree of determination to 
vote in the referendum -- are against the EU, only 35 percent 
are for it. 
  -  Among the farmers approval for the EU has slightly 
risen most recently -- 35 percent intend to vote "yes" -- but 
"no" still has a clear majority of 53 percent. 
  -  There is also a 
slight trend toward "yes" among retirees: According to the 
latest poll, 44 percent are in favor, 40 percent against joining 
the EU. Last week, the opponents were still slightly ahead with 
43 to 42. 
  -  However, the situation in some provinces is a 
threatening omen for the advocates of EU membership. The change 
in the mood in eastern Austria, above all in Lower Austria, 
which was noted already in last week's NEWS, is consolidating 
with great speed. In Lower Austria and in Burgenland already 52 
percent intend to vote against EU membership and only 42 percent 
for it. This is a difference of 10 percent, which is beyond any 
statistical fluctuations. 
  -  The frontlines are stabilizing among 
the party followers. Among the voters of the Social Democratic 
Party of Austria the proportion of "yes" votes (61 percent) has 
stayed the same, among voters of the Austrian People's Party it 
has even increased by 5 percent (now 60 percent). In contrast, 
the voices in favor of EU membership became softer among the 
opposition parties. Only 34 percent of the followers of the 
Freedom Party of Austria (last week 40 percent) are in favor of 
EU membership and 15 (18) percent of the Greens.

<F P=106> [Report by Conrad Seidl: "Bad Marks for Joerg Haider for </F>
the First Time"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- While all the other top politicians are 
thought to have increased their technical competence, Joerg 
Haider has had to accept unfavorable rating for the first time: 
While in December, one out of three Austrians thought he had "a 
clear concept for Austria's future," the May poll of the OGM 
[Austrian Society for Marketing] now says that this is no longer 
thought by even one-fourth of those polled. This is also 
reflected in the question on the direct election of the 
chancellor, which was reported by DER STANDARD last week. 
Haider is now clearly behind Busek. 
  OGM opinion researcher Christina Matzka sees one possible 
explanation in the policy of obstruction by the Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] in Carinthia and in the topic of the European 
Union [EU]: "This was perhaps a tiny bit too much." 
<H5>  Vranitzky Continues To Gain </H5>
  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky was able to further increase his 
excellent result of 70-percent approval rating, which he had 
gained in September: Now, 73 percent of Austrians say he has a 
clear program, 22 percent deny this. With 91 percent, the 
voters of the Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] support 
their top man more cohesively then ever. He earned the best 
results in small villages. 
<H5>  Busek Is Catching Up </H5>
  Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman Erhard Busek has 
been 
able to turn around his negative result of December (at that 
time only 42 percent thought he had a clear program, 44 percent 
did not think so): 47 percent now think he has a clear program 
and 43 percent do not think so. Busek received his good results 
from OeVP voters (65 percent approval) and SPOe voters (50 
percent). A total of 70 percent of FPOe voters rejected him. 
<H5>  Haider Plummeting </H5>
  Only 24 percent of those polled still think FPOe Chairman 
Joerg Haider has a clear program; even in his own party, the 
approval of his concept has declined from 88 to 75 percent. 
While in December Haider was particularly attractive to the 
less educated, he now gets approximately the same results from 
all strata of society. A total of 71 percent deny he has a 
clear program. 
<H5>  Schmidt in Third Place </H5>
Heide Schmidt of the Liberal Forum has clearly overtaken Joerg 
Haider regarding the question of her program: Approval rose 
from 27 to 30 percent, and rejection declined from 60 to 58 
percent. Schmidt wins with her own voters, but she also 
received respectable results from Greens and SPOe voters, while 
she was rejected by FPOe and OeVP followers. 
<H5>  Petrovic Gains Votes </H5>
  Greens Floor Leader Madeleine Petrovic has gained 2 percent 
since last December: 21 percent now think she has a clear 
program, and 60 percent deny that. Petrovic polarizes her 
supporters, in particular, between Greens and FPOe followers. 
Among the better educated approval of the Greens' program is 
skyrocketing.

<F P=106> [Report by Thomas Mayer: "Waldheim Calls For Release of All </F>
CIA Files About Himself"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Former President Kurt Waldheim would like 
the files about himself held by the U.S. intelligence service 
CIA to be published. "I do not mind if they are released," 
Waldheim told DER STANDARD on Wednesday [25 May]. 
  This would put an end once and for all to rumors about his 
working as an agent for the United States and the resulting 
"cover up" of Waldheim's alleged participation in war crimes by 
U.S. authorities. 
  This was prompted by reports in THE NEW YORK TIMES about new 
documents of the U.S. State Department. These are "top secret 
reports" by the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1961-68. 
  Their contents: Waldheim "is assessed by many sources as a 
prominent figure in the Foreign Ministry (in Vienna -- the 
editor) and has proved to be extremely cooperative and helpful 
in supporting U.S. interests," it was said in 1961. The U.S. 
Embassy sent almost identical assessments to Washington in 1966, 
after Waldheim had become UN ambassador, and in 1968, when he 
became foreign minister. 
  The paper asks why the United States supported Waldheim's 
election as UN secretary general in 1971, even though in 1948 he 
had been put on the list of suspects because of his service in 
the Wehrmacht in the Balkans. The fact that the CIA "did not 
find anything" when it made a security check in 1972 is 
considered an indication of his "cooperation" with the State 
Department. 
  After all, when Waldheim's wartime past became known in 1987 
he was put on the Watch List, THE NEW YORK TIME writes. Today 
there are still questions, not least about the "whitewashing 
description" of Waldheim's "cooperative support of U.S. 
interests," which, in intelligence circles, is an indication of 
work as an agent. 
  The former president sees such deductions as an attempt to 
"continue the slander campaign against me" in "a new version." 
The fact that he "was friendly" toward the United States, "does 
not mean that I was an agent." He does not doubt "that the CIA 
checked me." However, "the CIA was not able to report" more 
than a friendly attitude toward the United States, "because 
there is nothing else to report." 
  Waldheim assumes that the intention to generally "force the 
CIA to give information about prominent people" is at the back 
of the campaign. This view is confirmed by a corresponding 
appeal to the U.S. Congress in the article, he says.

<F P=106> ["vm." report: "Symbolic Gestures and Declarations of </F>
Intent During Kohl's Meeting With Mitterrand in Mulhouse"] 
  [Text] Mulhouse, 31 May -- With the proclamation of a 
joint initiative against racism and xenophobia in the European 
Union [EU], the 63d German-French summit ended in Mulhouse on 
Tuesday [31 May] at noon. Germany and France are proposing 
three measures to the EU Council: The establishment of a 
commission of "high-ranking personalities" that is to present 
proposals with the objective of more tolerance toward 
foreigners; a "comprehensive" strategy in the European Union to 
combat racism and xenophobia, and "opportunities for the 
approximation of legal provisions and practical courses of 
action" of the member states; joint relevant training for the 
officers of the responsible authorities. The initiative had 
come about at Germany's request. Apparently, after the 
xenophobic riots that are harming the FRG's reputation, the 
German side was obliged to take action. France complied with 
its partner's wishes. 
  Two symbolic acts shaped the Mulhouse meeting in a special 
way: Chancellor Kohl used the summit to return 28 valuable 
pictures and drawings that had fallen into the Germans' hands 
during World War II and had finally been taken to a GDR [German 
Democratic Republic] museum. The chancellor had brought the 
most important picture, a winter landscape by Monet, as a 
present for the host. The showing of the works of art in Paris 
is envisaged. Mitterrand said that the history of the pictures 
is a veritable "story." Kohl talked of a dramatic facet of 
Europe's fate in the past 50 years. 
  The chancellor paid tribute to the French president's 
invitation to the Eurocorps to participate in this year's 
military parade on the French National Day on 14 July as a 
"great gesture." In 1988, on the 25th anniversary of the Elysee 
Treaty, the German Guards Battalion had already lined up as an 
honor guard in the courtyard of the Invalids. However, no 
German soldiers have marched on the Champs-Elysees since the end 
of the war. The application of German-French cooperation also 
in the military sphere and the joint foreign and security policy 
of the European Union create the prerequisites for it. The 
chancellor accepted the invitation to Paris. In addition to 
Kohl, the heads of government of the other Eurocorps members; 
Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg, are also to be among the guests 
of honor on national day. 
  Regarding the European Union's future enlargement by the 
addition of Central and East Europen states, the opinions of 
Bonn and Paris have been further reconciled. Nevertheless, the 
different speeds are obvious. At the final news conference, 
Mitterrand warned against harmful "competition" in the fixing of 
deadlines for further entries. 
  The Community must not "gradually lose its meaning" by the 
enlargement and, in the end, become merely some kind of free 
trade zone. Kohl agreed with that and said: "For us there is 
no contrast between enlargement and deepening." Only "an 
enlarged free trade zone" would not be acceptable. 
  Germany and France will also use their successive EU 
presidencies for the preparation of the reform of the European 
Union's institutions, which is to be tackled in 1996. A 
document that was developed by the two governments, and is to be 
published after the European summit meeting on the Island of 
Corfu, serves for the coordination between the two partners in 
European politics in these "12 months of a uniform presidency" 
(Mitterrand). A decision on the succession of European 
Commission President Delors will also be made on Corfu. 
  Moreover, Kohl and Mitterrand announced further joint 
initiatives for the security of the nuclear power plants in 
Russia and East Europe, as news agencies reported in addition. 
Kohl said that he is not satisfied with the fact that other 
states do not assess the problem in the same way as Paris and 
Bonn. At the meeting of the seven most important industrial 
states (G-7) in Naples, one wants to insist on the closing down 
of the reactors of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. 
  At its 11th session during the meeting in Mulhouse, the 
German-French Defense Council affirmed that the two countries 
want to continue their close cooperation on the basis of the EU 
action plan in order to achieve a peaceful solution and the 
termination of the hostilities in Bosnia. Germany and France 
are advocating closer ties between the European Union and the 
Western European Union, and they also want to promote the 
introduction of the Central and East European states to the 
European security organizations. A communique of the Defense 
Council says: "Both countries also realize that there can be no 
real stability and security in Europe without cooperation with 
Russia." Germany and France repeated their intention to develop 
a large military aircraft. In its statement, the Defense 
Council affirmed that the new military transport aircraft is 
necessary because neither the range nor the carrying capacity of 
the aircraft that have been used in the two states so far -- the 
C-160 Transall, the C-130 Herkules, and the Alenia G 222 -- 
correspond to the needs of the two armed forces. Defense 
Minister Ruehe and Leotard agreed that the transport aircraft 
should not be designed completely anew but be based on 
preparatory work and experiences of the civil aircraft 
manufacturer Airbus. Aircraft manufacturers from Germany, 
France, Italy, Great Britain, and Spain who are interested in 
the construction of the aircraft have already formed a 
consortium. A feasibility study for the "Future Large Aircraft" 
is to be concluded by the end of 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Commission President Jacques Delors </F>
by Philippe Lemaitre and Claire Trean; place and date not given: 
"An Interview With Jacques Delors"] 
  [Text] [LE MONDE] Do you think the European stakes are 
clear for the French people? 
  [Delors] It is in partly inevitable that national stakes 
should overlap European issues. It is true that in France this 
is more marked than elsewhere. We also get the impression that 
those people who are called pro-Europeans are afraid to come out 
firmly in favor of their convictions. Nothing is perfect in the 
process of European construction, but we could have hoped that 
these people would at least say what should be done to improve 
the situation. When you listen to all sides, you get the 
feeling that the situation is totally unsatisfactory. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you not see a decline in the popularity of 
European construction? 
  [Delors] Our opinion polls show that there is no longer the 
euphoric feeling that marked the period 1988-1990. However, we 
have not returned either to the feeling of indifference that 
characterized the years before 1985, that is before I took over 
at the Commission. Opinion is still very much in favor of a 
united Europe, but a number of factors conspire to make the 
expression of this opinion less wholesale and not quite as 
enthusiastic. 
  [LE MONDE] The enlargement of the Union requires 
institutional reform. The French side seems convinced that this 
reform will be done at the expense of the little countries and 
the Commission. Is there an alternative way? 
  [Delors] The fathers of the Treaty of Rome wanted to give 
the 
European Community institutions that would enable it to make 
decisions in due course and to act efficiently. 
  In this spirit, everyone sees the European Commission as 
playing an essential role as a source of innovation, 
guaranteeing continuity and respect for the rules. If tomorrow 
we decided to change this institutional logic, we would run the 
risk of paralysis. The protagonists of the French campaign have 
decided to make the Commission a scapegoat charged with 
irresponsibility. 
  The truth is that the European Commission is answerable to 
the European Parliament which may censure it at any time. 
Moreover, in July 1993, I was asked to see out a 5th term of 
office of two years, and Parliament voted me in with an almost 
90 percent majority. No one ever remembers that in the debate. 
Of course, the operation of the institutions can be improved, 
but the problem is set out badly. 
  [LE MONDE] What of the little countries in an enlarged 
Europe? 
  [Delors] To date we have been able to work in the Community 
on the principle that no country, even the smallest, should be 
placed in difficulty when a vital interest is at stake. It is 
clear that, in a community with 25 or 30 members, this unwritten 
law may be more difficult to apply. Judge for yourself the gap 
between Germany on the one hand, with 80 million inhabitants, 
and countries like Malta and Cyprus on the other. Consequently, 
from this point of view, we have to think about a system that 
makes it possible to take into account specific national 
characteristics and which, at the same time, transcends these 
whenever we manage to identify a common interest. We will have 
to break new ground. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you like the idea of a President of Europe? 
  [Delors] The European Union needs an injection of 
personality. For the time being, even if I do not have the 
powers, in the eyes of some people I am the one who fills this 
role. In a European Union it would be useful if the European 
Council elected, every two and one-half years (twice in the life 
time of a European Parliament), someone who would be charged 
with representing the European Union, flanked by two vice 
presidents appointed in turn from all the member states. The 
issue is whether this president should at the same time head the 
European Commission. 
  The second argument in favor of this solution is that of 
continuity, especially where foreign policy is concerned. It is 
important for the United States, Japan and the continents of 
Asia, Latin America, and Africa to be able to deal with one 
person representing the position of the European Union for a 
relatively long period of time (flanked by two revolving vice 
presidents -- one from a "big" country and one from a "small" 
country). 
  [LE MONDE] Let us turn to a debate that has recently 
developed in France: Do you think Europe should demand the 
lifting of the Bosnian arms embargo? 
  [Delors] Let me remind you what, as long ago as 1992, I 
told the European Parliament -- a statement for which I was 
reproached because it exceeded my prerogatives. I condemned the 
ideology of ethnic cleansing. I added that, unless there was a 
credible threat of an armed intervention, the bearers of this 
ideology would not stop. Unfortunately, what I said has been 
borne out by subsequent events. Now it seems to me that, if we 
lifted the embargo, we would risk becoming embroiled in an 
unending war which would extend to other countries or end in the 
defeat of our Bosnian friends, given the reserve potential of 
the Serbian Army. 
  This is why I rally the praiseworthy and committed efforts 
of 
France -- in particular, Francois Mitterrand and Alain Juppe -- 
to try and bring all the belligerents back around the 
negotiating table on the basis of the European Union's plan 
which could be slightly reworked. However, there is one 
condition for this -- that the agreement that could be found in 
no way sanctions the ideological victory of those who reject the 
other protagonist to point of killing him. Thus, we need to 
increase the pressure we are putting on the Serbs. Politics is 
the art of choosing, at any time, the "least unfavorable" 
solution. I am not proud to have to say that, but I do not have 
the right to avoid your question. I should add that the 
intellectuals are only playing their role by questioning the 
politicians. 
  [LE MONDE] Do you think that the discredit which has been 
heaped on the Twelve's ambition to create a joint foreign policy 
can be repaired? 
  [Delors] It will be hard to repair this damage in the coming 
months, even assuming that we do manage to arrive at a peaceful 
solution imposed more by reason than what we feel in our hearts. 
In the Yugoslav tragedy I see the proof that Europe does not 
exist as a prime mover in foreign policy. What I would like is 
for the Twelve to decide on and carry through three or four 
joint foreign policy missions, where each country indisputably 
has the same interests at heart. 
  You will notice that I am not talking about a joint foreign 
policy, but joint foreign policy action. I have never thought 
that our countries, given their traditions, interests, and 
geopolitical situations, could share a complete joint foreign 
policy. 
  [LE MONDE] Let us return to the campaign in France. The 
candidates have no consideration for the Community institutions. 
In an interview on 19 April, [Socialist Party Chairman] Michel 
Rocard condemned "a European organization which bans the hunting 
of woodpigeons in the south of France but which is unable to ban 
the hunting of Muslims in the east of Bosnia." Dominique Baudis 
said much the same thing the very same day. How do you react to 
this kind of generalization? 
  [Delors] It dismays me to hear such untruths. I have already 
spoken about Bosnia. Let us talk about the woodpigeon issue. 
In 1979, the member states of the Community unanimously agreed 
to adopt a directive for the protection of wild birds -- 
especially migrating birds, and thus woodpigeons -- which are 
part of our common heritage since they fly across Europe. The 
principle is a simple one: We put a ban on their hunting while 
they are on the way back to their nesting grounds to protect the 
species. The dates the hunting season opens and closes were 
left up to each state to decide. That is the reality of the 
situation. The Commission strives in this area, as in others, 
to leave the final decision to the states, or even the regions, 
since they alone can judge the situation since they are closest 
to the areas in question. 
  [LE MONDE] People no longer seem to believe that Europe is 
capable of eliminating unemployment. Does the white paper you 
produced on the subject guarantee at least some concrete results? 
  [Delors] Unemployment is a European disease, and I have 
drawn the attention of the heads of state and government on this 
issue. From 1970 to 1990, the United States created 29 million 
new jobs, while Japan created 12 million new jobs, and we 
managed 9 million. Incidentally, these 9 million new jobs were 
created between 1985 and 1991, thanks to the relaunching of the 
process of European construction aiming at the single market. 
After that, I asked myself: Were these years just a slight 
upturn, the swan song of a Europe in decline, or was what 
happened a good omen for the future? The answers to this 
question can be found in the white paper. These answers are 
encouraging. The decline and the situation of mass unemployment 
were not predestined. 
  In this white paper we did not ask for extra powers for the 
Community. We said what we think should be done on the European 
level in the framework of our current powers (deepening the 
internal market, developing infrastructures, setting up an 
information society, and the necessary growth in investment and 
development research). We also said that at the national level 
there is much to be done for everything impacting on employment 
(education, training, work organization in companies, the 
operation of the labor market, unemployment benefit, etc.). In 
the light of national debates and the measures that have been 
taken, it is clear that the Europeans have decided to push for 
recovery. 
  [LE MONDE] So what concrete results are you expecting? 
  [Delors] At the next European Council in Corfu, I expect the 
following decisions to be made: Firstly, the adoption of an 
initial list of infrastructure projects and the means of funding 
them. In this way these projects will be able to get under way 
by the end of the year and provide support for the upcoming 
economic recovery while at the same time laying the foundation 
for more competitive structures and better town and country 
planning in Europe. 
  Secondly, I expect to see confirmation that my intuition was 
right as far as the information society is concerned, that this 
is a veritable revolution and that we must quickly equip 
ourselves with the means to ensure that Europe is present in 
this area. Thirdly, I expect us to continue exchanging 
information and innovation regarding everything that makes it 
possible to create new jobs. Moreover, I am currently working on 
new sources of jobs. Indeed, it is quite wrong to say that our 
societies will suffer from a lack of work and hence a shortage 
of jobs on offer. 
  [LE MONDE] The issue of Europe's borders has not really been 
debated by the Twelve so far. Do you have a conception of the 
limits of a greater Europe? 
  [Delors] I think that the limits of the greater Europe lie 
at 
the borders of the former Soviet Union. This means that Poland, 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Cyprus, and Malta 
-- not to mention the three Baltic states -- could all belong to 
the greater Europe. In addition, if peace returns to the former 
Yugoslavia, why not include Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, and what 
will have become of the Serbian-Montenegro union after a lot of 
water has flowed under the bridge and the ideology of ethnic 
cleansing has been eradicated. 
  I say this to illustrate the scope of the political and 
institutional problems you mentioned a little while ago. The 
other difficulty is that Russia is not enthusiastic about the 
idea of a greater European Union. We will only be able to build 
up this greater Europe if we offer Russia a very close 
partnership in the political and economic arenas, if we 
recognize Russia as a major power, and if we help it solve the 
problems arising in the former Soviet Union, especially in 
Ukraine. Hence the association agreements to be signed with 
Russia and Ukraine; hence our action to avoid the nuclear risk, 
especially in Chernobyl. 
  [LE MONDE] You mentioned the institutional difficulties 
encountered in creating a greater Europe, but there are also 
economic difficulties. In France, the leaders of the two main 
lists are in favor of enlargement, but they never say anything 
about either the agricultural problems or the budget problems 
that this enlargement entails. 
  [Delors] They are indeed very vague in what they say. That 
is also true for those who call the pro-Europeans a "club of the 
rich" without once mentioning the economic consequences and 
institutional structures of a greater Europe. The Commission is 
prepared to discuss these matters, whether it involves 
increasing the Community budget and the contributions of each 
participant, pursuing the basic objectives of the common 
agricultural policy, or the undoubtedly positive impact on 
economic growth and job creation. It is prepared to do this in 
liaison with the countries of East Europe, which have great 
needs to be met. 
  I would add that, as a citizen, I am prepared to bear the 
costs of a greater Europe geared toward peace and solidarity, by 
paying a bit more in taxes. But who talks about that? 
  [LE MONDE] What is your response to people who are worried 
about Germany's new influence since its reunification, or when 
faced with the prospect of an enlargement of the Union to the 
north and east? 
  [Delors] I would reply: Do we have a choice? If we feel 
that Germany is drifting toward other horizons and if we 
precipitate this drift by turning our backs on European 
integration, what will happen to us? If someone says to me, and 
rightly so, that Germany will be strong -- and it will be, 
because right now it is making considerable efforts at economic 
restructuring which few people in France are aware of -- well 
then I would reply that France must make the same effort, with 
or without European integration. 
  The most terrible and scandalous thing in the tale which 
certain candidates are spinning for the French people is that 
they are blaming Europe for changes in the world. The reality 
is that the world is changing for the better, and also for the 
worse. This can be seen in the new dangers which are appearing: 
ideologies based on rejecting others; confusion between faith 
and politics; fundamentalism; hypernationalism; etc. European 
integration is the only instrument that can enable us to 
confront this new world full of both danger and promise. 
  [LE MONDE] Since the storm of August 1993, the European 
Monetary System has been going rather well and the Member States 
are following a policy of tight convergence. However, if new 
difficulties were to emerge on the foreign exchange market, 
would the system be able to withstand attacks by speculators? 
  [Delors] I have noticed that operators on the foreign 
exchange market are talking increasingly of the prospect of 
economic and monetary union. In addition to that, there is the 
economic recovery, which will come about without aggravating 
imbalances or inflation. Economic and monetary union has 
regained credibility, and it must once again be considered a 
substantial element in a strategy aimed at promoting the concept 
of Europe. That is an encouraging observation. 
  [LE MONDE] In the debate on Maastricht, certain people 
([right-wing deputy] Philippe Seguin and [former Socialist 
Defense Minister] Jean-Pierre Chevenement) wondered whether 
Europe's economic policy did not pose a genuine danger to 
growth. Is this still a valid question? 
  [Delors] Now that is a question. So far, we have based our 
thinking on the following experience: Those countries which had 
a stable currency have performed better in terms of economic 
growth and job creation than the other countries. However, even 
if that provides ammunition in favor of economic and monetary 
union, it is not enough. I am continuing to fight those who 
would reduce economic policy down to a strong currency and norms 
on budgetary balance. I feel that economic policy is more 
complex, that during slumps we have to accept a budget deficit, 
and that it is not a bad thing to go into debt in order to 
finance investments that will benefit future generations. 
  It is my conviction that Europe will keep its model of 
society, while at the same time adapting to new situations, and 
that it will forge an original path of development which 
respects people's time and the environment. This Europe will 
keep its radiant personality enriched by its national and local 
diversity. In this Europe, our country -- France -- will have 
its own sizeable space for itself. Let us not be overcautious!

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Office [FO] today dramatically produced 
a "forged" letter from Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd to Defence 
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind -- and said it was the work of the 
Iranian intelligence service. 
  An FO spokesman said the letter, dated April 18 this year, 
purported to show British policy in Bosnia was anti-Muslim. 
  Another document was also published, allegedly from a 
disaffected member of the Foreign Office's staff. 
  "Members of the Iranian Embassy in London have been involved 
in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show 
that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the 
Muslims," the spokesman said. 
  Referring to the forged letter from Mr Hurd to Mr Rifkind, 
he 
added: "It is a crude attempt to copy Foreign Office form and 
style, and fails miserably." 
  Release of the documents at a news conference today came 
after Iran's explusion earlier of British diplomat Hamish Cowell 
from Tehran, in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's explusion 
last week of the first secretary at the Iranian Embassy in 
London, Vahid Belourchi. 
  Belourchi was asked to leave because of the false 
allegations 
about British policy in Bosnia contained in the two documents.

  [Text] The text of the forged letter from Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd to Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, dated April 
18, 1994, is as follows: 
  ``Dear Malcolm, 
  ``Following our conversation in the committee, I believe 
what 
has been done in recent days in Gorazde shows that General Rose 
and the British forces have been successful in implementing our 
policies. 
  ``These achievements are indeed creditable, and we should 
continue to give our full support to our troops. To keep the 
lead that we took in the United Nations in co-ordinating that 
effort, and to continue our policies, I think it is the 
appropriate time to respond to the (sic) General Rose's request 
for more troops. 
  ``As you have observed on your recent visits to the United 
States there might be some change of policy by the United States 
and some other European countries which disagree with our 
policies to help to (sic) the Serbs. 
  ``So I am beginning a new effort to persuade the United 
States Administration on (sic) our objectives and to ensure the 
others that we are trying to secure the long-term interests of 
Europe. 
  ``I believe much has been achieved, and there is a lot to be 
done. 
  ``Yours sincerely, 
  ``Douglas Hurd.''

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F>
Julie Kirkbride in London; date not given] 
  [Text] Statesman, diplomat and even peacemaker are among 
the more expected epithets applied to foreign secretaries, but 
Douglas Hurd chooses to describe his role in international 
affairs as "tradesman." 
  During his five-year stint at the Foreign Office, the 
Diplomatic Service has been transformed from concerns about war 
and peace to the more routine considerations of the trade 
balance. 
  Sitting in the regal splendour of the Foreign Office, Hurd 
explains: "Twenty years ago it would be some fellow down the 
corridor who would deal with trade. But this is the life I now 
lead. I've become a tradesman. It's extremely interesting and 
I've learned a lot." 
  The change is largely the result of a joint initiative with 
the Department of Trade and Industry, known as "Overseas Trade 
Services," which began three years ago. The co-operative 
venture has had an immense impact on the Diplomatic Service, 
with the more senior ambassadors now devoting as much as a third 
of their time to promoting British exports. 
  The export drive means that reporting back from a diplomatic 
posting to the Foreign Secretary in London takes on a wholly 
different dimension. 
  Mr Hurd explains: "Exports are a test of how well it's 
going. 
Every time I see an ambassador now, I have in my brief what the 
exports are -- and the subject always comes round to that." 
  A fifth of British diplomats abroad are engaged fulltime in 
commercial work, while nearly half of the locally-recruited 
staff are businessmen and women employed as commercial officers, 
actively seeking out opportunities for British exporters. 
  At present staff issue about 200 export-intelligence leads 
every day which are faxed to a central clearing house, sorted 
and sent directly to the relevant British businesses which have 
subscribed to the service. 
  People abroad are matched by a staff of 100 specialist 
export 
promoters in London, seconded from blue-chip businesses, to seek 
out overseas opportunities and follow up with assistance to the 
exporting companies. 
  The services cost from 15 pounds up to 1,000 pounds 
depending 
on requirements. But they can be very effective. As a result, 
Britain has sold vintage cars to Japan, electronics to Germany 
and an authentic English pub to the Danes. 
  But Hurd also recognises a wider, more delicate, role for 
the 
diplomatic service. "The big foreign contracts become political 
contracts," he says. As a result the ambassador is put "on the 
front line between business and politics." 
  To win these contracts for Britain "it is important to know 
who decides, who has his ear, what will influence the decision, 
who is important to him and what our competitors are doing." 
  Such big prizes are often backed up by ministerial visits, 
sometimes involving the pomp and ceremony of the Royal Family. 
  Last November, the Royal Yacht Britannia was moored in 
Bombay 
harbour in India while 1 billion pounds worth of contracts were 
signed involving more than 300 British businessmen representing 
100-plus firms. The Queen, Mr Major and the Indian premier 
looked on. 
  In July, Michael Heseltine, the President of the Board of 
Trade, will lead a similar delegation of businessmen to South 
Africa. 
  Hurd believes British overseas exports could be about to 
undergo a renaissance, capitalising on the country's early lead 
in privatising public assets. His office points to Severn Trent 
and North West Water who are supplying water to Mexico City, 
while British Gas has signed a 300 million pound contract in 
Chile to operate the Trans-Andean gas pipeline. 
  "I dare say we will make mistakes, but it's very exciting 
witnessing a new generation of British investors and 
entrepreneurs," he says.

<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Necker Calls For Strategy To Improve </F>
Germany as Industrial Center"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- The German economy is recovering 
slowly but steadily. This is how German Industry Federation 
(BDI) President Tyll Necker described the cyclical situation a 
day before the BDI annual meeting begins. 
  According to Necker's analysis, recovery is primarily 
attributable to orders received from abroad. He said he was 
glad that orders received increased 12.9 percent. This was, 
however, no reason for euphoria. Investment at home and 
consumption continued to be slow, he said. 
  Regarding investment, the slow-down had ended, but there was 
still no improvement. Necker said that this was attributable to 
high taxes and charges and to the fact that in many areas, 
existing capacities were not fully utilized. He said the 
production level was currently less than 10 percent below that 
of 1991, the year of economic boom. Necker: "If you come from 
the dark, gray is a light color." 
  The BDI president believes that a slow and steady upward 
trend, which is currently taking shape, is better than a flash 
in the pan. According to Necker, the change of mood in industry 
is attributable to the moderate wage policy. A change of 
thought has also taken place among policymakers. The decrease 
of public debt has at least been envisaged as a long-term goal. 
  The BDI president said the cost reduction programs in 
companies were taking effect, so that wage unit costs had 
decreased. Low interest rates and price increase rates were 
also having a positive effect. Even though the conclusion of 
the GATT round had not yet borne fruit, business and industry 
were glad that a trade war had been averted, said Necker. 
  Commenting on the situation of individual branches, he said 
the automobile sector should show more interest in orders 
received than in the number of registrations. An increasing 
demand would also lead to a production increase. In the 
engineering sector and in electrical engineering, the cycle was 
stimulated by foreign demand. In the chemical sector, orders 
received and employment had considerably increased. 
  Necker appealed to politicians, trade unions, and employers 
to continue to improve the competitiveness of Germany as a 
production center. In his view, such a strategy includes the 
following points: 

  -  Germany must reduce costs, instead of 
redistributing them. This holds true not only for industry, but 
also for the public sector. 
  -  The innovative ability of industry 
and society must be increased. 
  -  Deregulation must be carried out 
wherever possible. Necker: "The brake blocks must be 
removed!" 
  -  Unemployment must not be combated with defensive 
strategies. It is necessary to create more jobs, instead of 
distributing the shortage by other means. 

  Necker said that owing to changes inside and outside the 
German borders, management conditions in Germany had changed. 
Companies, politicians, employers and employees, and the whole 
society had to take this into consideration. Not only products 
and services but also the framework conditions for production 
and management were facing international competition. If it was 
necessary to create new jobs, instead of jeopardizing existing 
ones, these changes had to be met in an offensive way. 
  Necker said that at its annual meeting, the BDI wanted to 
conduct an open discussion with all democratic forces. At the 
meeting today, Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party), Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic 
Union), and IG Metall Metal Workers Union Chairman Klaus Zwickel 
will speak.

<F P=106> ["hal."-initialed report: "Chancellor and Candidate Vie for </F>
Support of Economy"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn, 31 May -- The parties are widely in 
agreement as far as the findings are concerned -- as an economic 
center, Germany is in a difficult situation. However, there are 
considerable differences regarding the necessary therapy. This 
became obvious at the annual meeting of the Federal Association 
of German Industry [BDI] in Bonn. BDI President Tyll Necker 
pointed out that his association had warned of the dangers for 
Germany as an economic center since 1987, and called for a major 
reduction of costs, deregulation, and for flexibility. 
  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl regards more part-time jobs 
as 
an essential opportunity to reduce unemployment. Apart from 
that, he called on the credit sector to think about 
possibilities to mobilize more equity capital and improve the 
financing situation in general. Federal Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], 
admitted that industry, which continues to constitute the basis 
of prosperity, had sometimes been badly treated. The minister 
accused the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] of 
preventing in the Bundesrat the necessary reforms for improving 
the quality of Germany as an economic center. However, he 
appeared to be optimistic believing that Germany had already 
embarked on the path out of the crisis. SPD Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping threw cold water on Rexrodt's optimism when he said 
that the German economy was still far away from a real upswing. 
Scharping warned against an unrealistic assessment of economic 
developments only because of the upcoming election and against 
presenting the economy as being sounder than it really is. 
  The federal chancellor said he was optimistic about economic 
developments. Kohl delivered his speech at the dinner at night, 
which is why he did not meet his challenger, who addressed the 
meeting in the morning. Rexrodt said that the Germans had 
understood that they have to make efforts themselves and that 
they could not always come up with demands. In that respect, 
people understand the necessity to consolidate the state 
finances. The minister resolutely rejected the creation of new 
subsidies. He gave assurance that the coalition would before 
long present the tax policy concept for the next legislative 
term as demanded by the business community. Moreover, the 
coalition was thinking of ways and means of introducing tax 
concessions for private risk capital that goes to the new 
laender. The coalition had picked up this proposal from Necker. 
In the medium term, tax on revenues must be cut. Moreover, the 
solidarity surcharge, due to be reintroduced in January 1995, 
must be phased out again as quickly as possible. The essential 
thing is not only to reduce high unemployment but to return to 
full employment. This will mean that the labor market has to be 
reorganized and made more flexible. All measures must be geared 
toward strengthening industry decisively, because economic 
developments are essentially dependent on industry and not on 
the service sector, as many people now claim. Rexrodt said that 
the strong growth rates in the east German production sector 
confirm his assessment that, deep inside, German industry is 
sound and vital. 
  Yet, according to Scharping, the growth rates on the foreign 
markets are not sufficient when hardly anything or nothing at 
all is happening on the domestic markets, which are decisive for 
75 percent of the economy. Enterprise incomes in east Germany 
are only the result of transfers. Investments are being "blown 
up" through special depreciation. The SPD chancellor candidate 
repeated the promise that if they were to win the election in 
October, the SPD would under no circumstances increase the 
burden of taxes and rates beyond the 1995 level. The more than 
52 percent of state share in the national product would be 
reduced in the same way as net new borrowing, once the overall 
developments of the economy permitted. 
  At the same time, Scharping promised the continuation of 
investment promotion for 1995. The minister president of 
Rhineland- Palatinate was worried that the share of research and 
development funds in the federal budget sank by almost 
one-third. This must change, because aviation and space 
technology, environmental and gene technology must be 
strengthened again in Germany. Therefore one must think how 
participations in risk capital can be effectively promoted 
through regulations in the sphere of income and corporation tax 
laws. At the same time, a reform of the trade tax was 
necessary, too. 
  Having said that, Scharping once more outlined his ideas of 
a 
supplementary tax for high income earners. It is to be expected 
that private consumption would significantly decrease as a 
result of a burden caused by the contributions to the nursing 
care insurance and the solidarity surcharge. This would make 
moderate wage agreements more difficult. Since this was bad for 
the economy, the state should no longer attack the pockets of 
the employees and increase taxes only for the top 20 percent of 
income-earners. "Everybody has the moral duty to contribute to 
the well-being of the community as a whole," Scharping said.

<F P=106> ["bos"-signed report: "Bonn Wants To Speed Up Monetary </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said the German 
Government will take advantage of Germany's duty presidency of 
the European Union [EU] in the second half of 1994 in order to 
"take concrete steps toward European Monetary Union." 
  At a talk with 100 key managers of Brandenburg and Berlin 
industry on the subject of Germany's industrial situation, 
Rexrodt said that some of Germany's partners are still not happy 
about the idea of a single Europe. Nothing can happen, he said, 
unless France and Germany reach agreement on some thorny EU 
issues. On the other hand, some partner countries have been 
complaining about excessively narrow German-French agreements, 
according to Rexrodt. "Right now, there is a lack of 
initiatives on the subject of the EU's development that would 
enjoy the support of most members from the very beginning," said 
Rexrodt. 
  In reply to fears from some of the industrialists concerning 
monetary union, Rexrodt pledged that Bonn would reach no hasty 
decision on this matter. This is a subject that can only be 
dealt with in small steps, he said. 
  The German Government assumes that its EU partners would not 
like to see an instable Deutschmark and are, therefore, willing 
to accept some German solutions in their own interests. In the 
long run, there is no alternative to a single European currency. 
  Rexrodt said that the currency issue is directly linked to 
the government's efforts to "bring something new" to Europe. 
"The united Europe must be more than a league of nations but 
less than a federal republic," he said. "If we do not achieve 
this kind of Europe, there will be more situations where people 
are dying in a terrible war just a few hundred kilometers from 
Munich and everyone else is just watching it happen." The 
absence of a unified security concept is one of the EU's 
greatest shortcomings, according to Rexrodt. Monetary, 
economic, and security policy should be viewed closer together. 
  Rexrodt said he fails to understand the tendency of the 
British, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Greeks to restrict East 
European countries' access to West European markets. One cannot 
expect progress in the economic transformation process if one 
deprives the developing East European markets of maneuvering 
space, this being a prerequisite for these countries' full EU 
membership, he said. 
  According to Rexrodt, the current EU members are located a 
long way away from the East European reform countries and have 
little understanding of these countries' dilemma. The Germans 
in the middle of Europe should adopt a leading role. An 
eastward expansion of the EU can only be performed slowly, 
through a process of separate association agreements. It is 
important that the east European countries see each step as part 
of the general road toward full EU membership, said Rexrodt.

<F P=106> ["agr/vp" report: "Minister Rexrodt Wants To `Open the </F>
Door' in Airbus Marketing"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- With his British, French, and Spanish 
colleagues, Economics Minister Rexrodt wants to "open the door" 
for the international marketing of Airbus. At a meeting with 
the economics ministers of the above three countries on the 
sidelines of the Berlin International Air and Space Show -- the 
meeting also attended by representatives of the Airbus 
consortium, including German Aerospace Director Juergen E. 
Schrempp -- Rexrodt said that state support for the sale of top 
German technologies abroad is a key component of foreign and 
economic policy, and is not limited just to the Airbus project. 
  However, talks at government level should not be used to 
apply political pressure or impose financial restrictions, it 
was said. The four ministers agreed to combat unfair financial 
dealings and political malpractice on the aviation market. 
  Rexrodt said the European enterprises involved in the 
construction of the Airbus had complained of being at a 
disadvantage compared to their main U.S. competitors. He said 
there are indications that the American competition is 
advertising its aircraft in a very determined and unconventional 
manner, availing itself of help from the U.S. Government. 
Specifically, Rexrodt criticized distortions in competition, 
something that violates agreements reached with credit instance 
companies. Observers view this as a clear indication of the 
Americans' business dealings with Saudi Arabia. 
  Rexrodt said the initial German contribution to the Airbus 
program amounts to a "refundable 6.5 billion German marks [DM]." 
A general increase in the financial contribution for the 
purpose of research into future technologies can be expected in 
the medium term, he said. 
  Wolfgang Piller, president of the Association of German Air 
Industry, told HANDELSBLATT that the state is providing the 
German aviation industry with DM6 million for the purposes of 
aviation research. In the United States, on the other hand, 
$2.7 billion has been provided for air research indirectly 
through NASA and the Pentagon. 
  While government aircraft orders in the United States 
constitute 64 percent of all such orders, in Germany government 
aircraft orders only amount to 38 percent, said Rexrodt. In the 
United States, 30 experimental projects have been commissioned, 
compared to only one in Europe -- in the Netherlands. This 
provides a springboard for U.S. moves to distort competition. 
The supportive words of European politicians should finally be 
followed by deeds, according to Rexrodt. 
  In the meantime, the absence of the four-engine long-range 
Airbus A-340 on the air show's opening day is viewed as a bone 
of contention on the sidelines of the economics ministers 
conference. The Airbus had to remain on the ground at Toulouse 
because an agreement between Lufthansa and German Aerospace 
about who should pay for the flight collpased at the last 
moment. Apparently, German Aerospace withdrew its financial 
involvement in Airbus.

<F P=106> [`enn/now' report: "European Union Foresees No Law Suit </F>
Regarding Eko-Aid"] 
  [Excerpt] Berlin/Brussels, 30 May -- The European Union 
[EU] Commission has asked the German Government to explain the 
failure to privatize the Eko-Stahl Steel Plant in 
Eisenhuettenstadt, but does not intend to file any charges with 
the European Court in Luxembourg on account of continued 
financial aid. The EU Commission communicated this decision to 
the Federal Economics Ministry today, thus canceling previous 
rumors about a possible law suit for violating Article 95 of the 
European Coal and Steel Communities Treaty. 
  On 18 May, the EU Commission had already informed the 
Economics Ministry that financial aid from the Eko-Stahl 
trustees would no longer be included in the restructuring 
concept controlled by the Italian Riva concern, which the EU 
Council of Ministers had approved last December. The Eko 
trustees are currently paying the steel plant 120 million German 
marks per month in order to preserve the plant's financial 
capability and prevent the interruption of investment projects 
hat have already started. At its 20 May meeting, the Eko-Stahl 
trustees council had pledged to continue the aid until at least 
20 May. [passage omitted]

areas considerable, does not deteriorate completely. Neumann, 
who is now in Moscow, said many research institutions there are 
threatened with collapse because salaries can no longer be paid 
and there is no money for energy and material.

<F P=106> ["P.St." report: "Eastern German Economy Experiencing </F>
Further Upswing"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- Industrial production and orders received 
in the new laender are on their way up and increased further in 
March. Compared with the previous month, industrial output went 
up 20 percent and orders received by 6.3 percent. This data was 
announced by the Economics Ministry in Bonn on Thursday [26 
May]. However, a spokesman stressed the effect of seasonal 
influences, in particular regarding production, which cannot yet 
be calculated. In the preceding four winter months, production 
had declined steadily. Orders went up by 4.2 percent in 
February. 
  In the view of the eastern German Halle Economic Research 
Institute (IWH), the processing industry is also one of those 
branches that support growth now. "Despite existing problems, a 
growing number of branches are expanding," department head Udo 
Ludwig told NEUE ZEIT. 
  The construction sector, which is particularly susceptible 
to 
weather conditions, reported to the ministry the strongest 
production growth compared with the previous month, namely 47.1 
percent. Compared with the same period last year, the 
construction sector grew by 16.2 percent. The processing 
industry and electricity and gas supply increased their 
activities by 13.8 and 5.1 percent respectively compared with 
the previous month, and by 21.7 percent and 8.8 percent 
respectively compared with the same month last year. Mining, on 
the other hand, reduced its production by 7 percent. Compared 
with the previous year, mining activities went down by 15.1 
percent. 
  Compared with the same period last year, orders received 
were 
up 10.4 percent. Foreign orders clearly increased by 32.5 
percent, while domestic orders experienced an increase by 2.9 
percent. The basic materials and producer goods industry showed 
the highest growth in orders with plus 34 percent. In the 
consumer goods industry, orders received increased by 16.1 
percent. In the investment goods sector, on the other hand, a 
decline of 7.9 percent in orders was registered, the Economics 
Ministry announced. 
  In the two-month comparison between February/March and 
December/January, an increase in orders of about 2.5 percent was 
noticed. Foreign orders went up by about 17.5 percent and 
domestic orders by about 6 percent.

<F P=106> [`ke'-signed report: "Help for Eastern German Space </F>
Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Berlin, 29 May -- In 1993, the German Space Agency 
supplied 52.7 billion German marks [DM] to support space 
travel-related activities in eastern Germany. This year, the 
Agency has over DM53 billion at its disposal for this purpose, 
said General Director Jan-Baldem Mennicken at the International 
Air and Space Exhibition in Berlin. The task of the Agency, 
which cooperates closely with the German Air and Space Travel 
Research Institute, is to preserve and coordinate space 
travel-related activity in the former GDR. Apart from 
Jena-Optronic GmbH, which used to be a part of the Zeiss Jena 
complex and now belongs to German Aerospace, the Agency also 
supports an entire range of medium and small east German 
enterprises that are engaged primarily in the manfacture of 
smaller satellites, measuring equipment, and geophysical 
research. One of these enterprises is FMP Space Sensor GmbH in 
Freiberg, Saxony, which produces small satellites. The 
Neubrandenburg firm GTA, which is engaged in measurement and 
geophysics, was founded by scientists from the former GDR Space 
Research Institute in 1991. With the German Space Agency's 
help, these enterprises should also be permitted access to large 
European space projects.

<F P=106> [`hjh' report: "De Maiziere Criticizes Union"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Potsdam -- Lothar de Maiziere (CDU) 
[Christian-Democratic Union], the final GDR prime minister, is 
once again interfering in politics. With Peter-Michael 
Diestel, the final GDR interior minister, he attended the 
foundation of a CDU branch in Frankfurt/Oder, where he 
criticized the policies of the Brandenburg CDU and CSU 
[Christian Socialist Union]. "We must perform opposition work 
again," said De Maziere, who resigned from the post of 
Brandenburg CDU chairman because of his controversial Stasi 
contacts. The CDU cannot involve itself in "Stolpe's personnel 
problems" forever, said the former prime minister, who called 
for tolerance in evaluating the past. 
  The Brandenburg CDU/CSU leadership did not wish to 
exaggerate 
the significance of the appearance by the two CDU politicians. 
At the sidelines of the CDU Brandenburg party congress in 
Strausberg, it was said that there were no objections to the 
political involvement of De Maiziere and Diestel. Diestel and 
the CDU Brandenburg leadership had a disagreement in 1992 in 
connection with the accusations of Stasi involvement leveled 
against Minister President Manfred Stolpe [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Ewald Koenig: "Hail of Tomatoes and Eggs for </F>
Joerg Haider"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman 
Joerg Haider and Manfred Brunner, chairman of the League of Free 
Citizens (BFB), spoke to hundreds of nonlisteners in Bonn on 
Tuesday evening [31 May]. Shrill whistles and choruses ("Nazis 
out" and "Piss off!") prevented the anti-Europe speeches of the 
two politicians on Muensterplatz in Bonn. There were no 
excesses. 
  A hail of eggs and tomatoes rained on the rostrum (and on 
the 
journalists) from time to time. Policemen protected the 
speakers with shields. Banners saying "We do not want a second 
H. from Austria" or "One Austrian was enough" were shown to the 
election campaigners. At a news conference afterward, Haider 
said this was "a sign of xenophobia." 
  Only a few fragments of the speeches came out of the 
loudspeakers. Brunner: "If there is not a European people, 
there cannot be a European Parliament either." Haider warned 
against Jacques Delors and the goal of a "socialist central 
state of Europe." Anyone who does not vote for Brunner's Ticket 
13 at the European election on 12 June will initiate "the end of 
democracy in Germany." 
  After 25 minutes of a turbulent rally, Haider and Brunner 
were led to a police bus. When they spoke to journalists a 
little later, Brunner and Haider agreed: It was a "very 
important event," the "highlight of a power struggle of the 
German left." Haider announced that, after his return, he will 
"ask the Austrians during the final stage before the European 
elections and in view of these pictures from Germany: `Do you 
want to have that in Austria?'" 
  Brunner then said: "It would be good for the European Union 
if Austria gave it a shock." In addition, he regretted that 
Bonn "abolished Article 23 (article on accession) in advance 
obedience." Not that Germany should become active by itself, he 
stated seriously and with Haider's approval: "But why have the 
neighboring countries been deprived of the opportunity to apply 
for acceding?"

<F P=106> ["ban"-signed report: "Number of Crimes in Germany </F>
Increasing"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 30 May -- German police registered 6.75 
million criminal offenses last year, that is some 2.7 percent 
more than in 1992. This emerges from the 1993 "Police Criminal 
Statistics" that were presented by Interior Minister Kanther 
(Christian Democratic Union) and Brandenburg's Interior Minister 
Ziel (Social Democratic Party of Germany -- SPD), the chairman 
of the interior ministers' conference in Bonn on Monday [30 
May]. Kanther said the latest developments are a cause for 
concern. "Efforts at crime prevention must be significantly 
increased at all levels." Legal and police measures are to be 
adapted to the "criminal challenge." Ziel pointed out that crime 
figures in eastern Germany have reached western German levels. 
Offenses against property, border and transit crimes are 
especially high in eastern Germany. Ziel said the reason for 
this is the wide gap in prosperity between Germany and its 
neighbors to the East. 
  The 1993 report is the first criminal statistics covering 
all 
of Germany. It is based on reports by police stations in the 
laender and registers offenses and suspects, but not convictions. 
  Kanther announced that the coalition will present an 
amendment to the Federal Criminal Law before the end of this 
legislative term. He rejected Ziel's proposal to divide the 
Crime Prevention Act that was adopted by the Bundestag recently 
into controversial and undisputed sections and to pass these in 
the Bundesrat. Kanther stressed that the package of laws is 
"moderate" and not the "Union's doctrine." He rejected SPD 
criticism of the key witness regulation for offenders involved 
in organized crime, of the envisaged speeding up of procedures, 
and the Federal Intelligence Service's new responsibilities. He 
said that the latter must have the possibility of passing on 
information that it comes across by coincidence. The package of 
laws has to be adopted as an entity. Ziel criticized this 
attitude. He called for talks. The Bundesrat's domestic 
affairs committee last week rejected the coalition's bill by 10 
votes to six. 
  The two ministers welcomed the fact that the detection rate 
rose from an average 42.3 percent to 43.8 percent. In western 
Germany it was even 46.5 percent. However, the detection rate 
for murder and homicide cases decreased from 91.2 percent to 
84.7 percent. By investigating some 2.96 million offenses, some 
2.1 million suspects were tracked down in 1993. The damage 
caused by crimes is almost 5 billion German marks. More than 50 
percent of all offenses are thefts. There were above average 
increases in offenses against the foreigner and asylum laws, 
forgery of documents, theft from vending machines, and 
pick-pocketing. Decreases were registered in handling stolen 
goods, heroin trafficking, car thefts, and bicycle thefts. 
  Statistics on violent crimes present an irregular picture. 
In western Germany it went up by 1.8 percent. The report does 
not contain comparative figures for eastern Germany. Yet, at 
198 in the whole of Germany, the rate of offenses per 100,000 
inhabitants was lower than in the west German laender (203). A 
total of 1,468 cases of murder and homicide were registered, 
which is slightly more than in 1992. 
  Drug related crime decreased by 1.7 percent in the west 
German laender. The number of deaths caused by drugs decreased 
from 2,099 to 1,738. The number of "first consumers" of hard 
drugs also went down -- from 14,346 in 1992 to 12,994 in 1993. 
Accordingly, "direct procurement crimes" (such as burglaries in 
chemists) sank by 1.9 percent. Of all crimes, 6.9 percent fell 
under the category of "indirect procurement crimes"; in 1992 the 
relevant figure was 7.8 percent. 
  Kanther pointed out that the number of suspects who are 
Germans or have been living in Germany for a long time is going 
down. The increasing number of foreigners among the suspects -- 
in western Germany the percentage rose from 32.2 percent to 36.2 
percent, in Germany as a whole it is 33.6 percent -- are 
foreigners who came to Germany only recently or who were here 
temporarily. A total of 37 percent of all crimes committed by 
foreigners were committed by asylum seekers. Kanther reported 
that in 1993, 2,400 "touts" were detained. Fifty percent of all 
asylum seekers were taken to Germany by these people under false 
pretenses. That is why there is a link between border 
protection and general crime prevention, Kanther said.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F>
Dirk Koch and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date not given: 
"Red-Green Does Not Frighten" -- ellipses as published] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, do you think that the 
offended reaction of leading Social Democrats, particularly 
Rudolf Scharping, to Johannes Rau's defeat in the presidential 
elections is a good strategy for recruiting new voters? 
  [Verheugen] Our reaction was well-considered. We had enough 
time to think about it.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...because you knew long before the elections 
that Rau would not win.... 
  [Verheugen] ...we did not know it, but we had to assume a 
defeat as being realistic. I am sure that the media criticism 
of our reaction and what the people are thinking are two 
different things. I think it is necessary to tell those who 
want to preserve our state's liberal face that the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is not available for this, but 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is indeed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you accuse the FDP of having been 
consistently loyal to the coalition? 
  [Verheugen] The FDP deceived the public. Even in the days 
and hours before the Federal Convention met, Messrs. Kinkel and 
Solms gave the impression that the FDP was free to decide in 
favor of the candidate who was best suited in the view of 
liberal party. In reality, the FDP was not free. I assume 
Kinkel had promised the chancellor to vote for Herzog long ago. 
On the other hand, the allegedly liberal party is failing in 
its own claim if it votes for the one candidate out of four who 
is the only one who cannot be called liberal. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] As former FDP secretary general, can you 
imagine the price that the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] had to pay for this voting behavior by 
its coalition partner? 
  [Verheugen] Yes, the at least silent tolerance of a second 
vote campaign for the Bundestag elections. And this will come 
with absolute certainty, because the FDP is now approaching zero 
in the polls. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Since last week, the loser Johannes Rau, 
looking very thoughtful, can be seen on the poster for the 
European elections. Is the appeal "revenge for Rau" supposed to 
make undecided voters enthusiastic for the SPD? 
  [Verheugen] Our strategy is focused on the up to 40 percent 
of voters who are undecided, and there are also those who do not 
yet know whether they are going to vote at all. They see things 
differently than you do. The majority of them wanted Rau. We 
are bringing to the fore the discrepancy between the will of the 
majority of the people and the existing conditions of power, 
which we want to change. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And these arguments are supposed to strengthen 
the SPD after the meager 33.5 percent in 1990? This looks more 
like therapy for the loser than like a recipe for success. 
  [Verheugen] Don't worry. We will not replace our election 
topics with the discussion about the presidential elections. 
This topic will disappear within a relatively short period. 
However, we should be driven out of the Erich Ollenhauer House 
if now, after Rau is again available as a party politician, we 
were to hide a man with his reputation and his popularity in the 
final stage of the European election campaign. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the SPD's course of cozying up to those in 
power now over? 
  [Verheugen] We are not cozying up; we want to replace this 
government. Things are now getting really exciting. The 
conflict will escalate. This is necessary. The voters must 
realize why they should vote for another party. After all, the 
SPD must make a number of voters vote differently at the next 
Bundestag election than at the last election. For this purpose, 
the differences must become clear. The party's profile must be 
worked out quite clearly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This has not been done so far. 
  [Verheugen] I think this is wrong. I was unhappy about a 
few things in the recent past. I have been most unhappy about 
the course of the program discussion. It is conceived as the 
substantiation of a large reform project, for modernization and 
renewal. The program was not taken because of one or two 
conventional issues. It was wrongly defamed as a program of 
adjustment and the blurring of Social Democratic positions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Well, perhaps the paper is not worth much? 
  [Verheugen] The program is a draft that counters the policy 
of the current government. It provides the justification why we 
are making the claim to a change in power and it justifies this 
claim in terms of issues. After all, it is not enough to say in 
a democracy that it is good if power changes every few years. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] SPD Chairman Scharping in particular has done 
more to rid the citizens of the fear of a change than to explain 
to them the different policy of an SPD-led government. 
  [Verheugen] This is true to the extent that we have to 
fulfill a complicated dual task. We must free the citizens who 
have not voted for the SPD so far of the fear that an SPD 
Government -- I am deliberately exaggerating -- will open up a 
new chapter in the text books of Marxist Socialism. Therefore, 
over the past months, we have concentrated very strongly on 
social, economic, and internal security. And we must convince 
those who call for a fundamental change in policy. I cite 
topics such as ecological change, the reform of state and 
administration, and the correction of social imbalances. We 
must live up to both demands. We have decided to do one thing 
after the other. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] "Safety Instead of Fear" is the slogan; and 
the SPD poster show a floating boat with father and son, both of 
whom are asleep. Where are they floating to -- perhaps to power 
in the Federal Government? 
  [Verheugen] This is a completely impermissible exaggeration. 
The poster transposes a political demand into an image; nothing 
else. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The slogan sounds as defensive as the picture 
looks sleepy. 
  [Verheugen] I think "Safety Instead of Fear" is an 
aggressive formula: The policy of the current government causes 
fear. The whitewashing of the government and the media that are 
kindly disposed toward it does not change anything about the 
dramatic unemployment, the gigantic debts, and the social 
injustice. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In contrast to your advice, Mr. Verheugen, the 
SPD has not managed to rid the people of the fear of higher 
taxes. 
  [Verheugen] We had to comment on the supplementary tax, 
which is supposed to replace the government's solidarity 
surcharge -- better early than too late before the elections. 
By the way, it means less tax for more than 80 percent of the 
tax payers, not higher taxes. Our central statement for the 
next years is: No higher tax quota with the SPD, but 
redistribution. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This does not reassure those citizens who are 
afraid of a higher payroll tax and more expansive gasoline. 
  [Verheugen] This is correct. Since 1982 the Kohl government 
has put a burden on medium and smaller incomes to ease the 
burden on top earners and companies; here corrections are 
necessary -- therefore, we want the supplementary tax only for 
single people with incomes of 60,000 German marks [DM] and 
couples with incomes of DM120,000; therefore we want tax 
exemption for the subsistence level; therefore we want a limit 
to the advantage of tax splitting, therefore, we want a DM250 
children's allowance for everyone. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why was the SPD suddenly frightened when 
Scharping spoke of burdens for high-wage earners? That is, 
after all, the point. 
  [Verheugen] The concept of who is a high-wage earner in 
Germany differs so much that this term cannot be used 
politically. We did not use it, either. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This Social Democratic confusion of language 
has contributed to attacks on the SPD from all sides. The 
economic associations, by whose support your party leaders felt 
flattered for a long time, accuse the SPD of a mentality of 
redistribution. "I do not know where Mr. Scharping wants to get 
to. I do not know why he is actually in politics," Frankfurt 
functionary Tom Koenigs, a Green reform politician, said. 
  [Verheugen] The reaction by some representatives of industry 
is not typical for the general mood. Party followers have taken 
a stand here. Just let them continue. When they tried it the 
last time, in 1972, the SPD got its greatest victory. That Mr. 
Koenigs is not interested in saying anything positive about 
Scharping is quite obvious. As regards the program: You may 
well trust us to streamline the reform projects contained in it 
in such a way that they become unmistakable. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not already too late? At the moment, it 
looks as if Chancellor Kohl has turned the negative trend around. 
  [Verheugen] Don't make me laugh. For more than half a year 
there has been no poll that gives the coalition more than 43 
percent of the votes. Shifts to the benefit of the CDU take 
place at the cost of the FDP. Just wait for the upcoming 
discussions, when unemployment once again raises by 400,000 to 
500,000 on annual average, when the people realize that DM1 out 
of DM4 in the federal budget must be spent on interest and the 
repayment of debts. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What would the SPD have to offer in detail for 
the first 100 days of its government? 
  [Verheugen] Purposeful investment promotion for job creation 
measures, relieving labor of taxes and contributions, more 
flexible work times, and more intensified labor promotion. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This means primarily redistribution of 
existing work, not stimuli for growth. 
  [Verheugen] No, the point is growth and consolidation. We 
want to profoundly transform our economy and society through 
ecological change. Saying simply that we need growth is 
nonsense, because we will not be able to ecologically tolerate 
purely quantitative growth at the level that would be necessary 
to combat unemployment. Therefore, the SPD will not agree to a 
return to nuclear energy. I can compare such a social change 
only with Willy Brandt's great reform project in 1969. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do these prospects for reform not 
automatically result in a preference for a red-green coalition? 
Or do you think that you can implement the ecological change 
more easily in a grand coalition or in an SPD-FDP-Greens 
coalition? 
  [Verheugen] If a coalition is necessary, I would prefer a 
small one, just two parties. The SPD-FDP-Greens coalition is 
not a tempting idea at the federal level. We have already said 
we do not want a grand coalition. I think we cannot -- which 
will be the case -- wage the election struggle claiming it is 
time for a change and then include in the government the very 
people whose politics we want to change. This would make us 
lose our credibility. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does a party that wants to bring about a 
change in power with reforms need a trademark, in this case a 
coalition statement in favor of red-green? 
  [Verheugen] In any case, for a reform-oriented policy we 
need a majority that is ready for reforms. A clear policy 
automatically gets its majority. I am firmly convinced that 
this will also happen after this Bundestag election. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does the idea of a red-green coalition still 
give rise to fear in the bourgeois camp? 
  [Verheugen] I assume that red-green no longer frightens 
anyone at the federal level, either. This is quite clearly 
shown by election results and polls. We have good reasons to 
want an election result that offers us options. Which option is 
then chosen depends on how we can best implement our policy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you think of reforms that would be easier 
to implement with the FDP than with the Greens? 
  [Verheugen] If I look at the current Bundestag group and at 
the FDP leadership, I do not see at all where one can still 
expect any readiness for reform in this party. However, one 
must not forget: The most important thing for the FDP is 
participation in government. Being the second or third 
strongest opposition party would be an existential risk for it. 
This might force the FDP to pay high prices for participating 
in an SPD-led government. The ecological changes could 
certainly be implemented more easily with the Greens. However, 
they too must move from unrealistic positions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Can you imagine that the FDP might get enough 
votes for a majority with the SPD but not with the CDU/CSU in 
the autumn? 
  [Verheugen] At the moment I see the FDP somewhere on the 
fringe. I do not even see it back in the Bundestag. The second 
vote campaign of the FDP, which I assumed will be at the cost of 
the CDU/CSU, and raises our prospects for becoming the strongest 
party. Purely in terms of numbers, neither of the two people's 
parties currently has the opportunity for a coalition with the 
FDP. However, this is really bad only for Kohl. He can no 
longer assemble a majority. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How long do you want to keep your voters 
waiting? 
  [Verheugen] We will begin the hot stage of the Bundestag 
election campaign with a Germany meeting on 4 September. There 
we will present our 100-day program. The better we streamline 
our goals there, the easier it will be to answer the coalition 
question -- which will, in the end, practically answer itself. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your chairman, Scharping, is burdened with the 
image of being respectable but boring. Is he the candidate for 
reforms and visions? 
  [Verheugen] Does Helmut Kohl have charisma? In any case, he 
won elections. Rudolf Scharping has those qualities that an SPD 
candidate for the chancellor's office needs in 1994 in order to 
win the elections. An election year like this one has its very 
own drama. In the end, one must still have enough breath for 
the final effort. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Verheugen, thank you for this interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Antje Vollmer, frontrunner of Alliance </F>
90/Greens in the upcoming Bundestag elections, by Wolfgang 
Wischmeyer; place and date not given: "`I Advise the SPD To Get 
to Its Feet as Quickly as Possible'"] 
  [Text] [Wischmeyer] You were once called a "partisan of 
permanent departure." Where are you departing to just now? 
  [Vollmer] What might be more interesting is that from where 
I have just departed to enter politics again -- it was from a 
far distance. I am currently working in the science college in 
Berlin with 30 scientists and artists who help each other think 
-- a bit of monastery and a bit of magic mountain. 
  [Wischmeyer] And from there you go into the morasses of 
everyday politics. What is your objective on your return to the 
Bundestag? 
  [Vollmer] I am not coming back as a greenhorn, but as 
someone who has enough experience with green policies and 
sufficient experience in opposition politics. What would be 
attractive is the Greens getting the chance to create something. 
  [Wischmeyer] Are they capable of doing that? 
  [Vollmer] If things fail it will certainly not be because of 
the Greens. 
  [Wischmeyer] Abolition of the Bundeswehr, leaving NATO -- 
will the Mannheim resolutions not stand in the way of this? 
  [Vollmer] We have indicated very clearly that the Mannheim 
resolutions are very general ideas, but not a specific 
government program. 
  [Wischmeyer] How do you see the Social Democratic Party's 
[SPD] behavior after the presidential elections? 
  [Vollmer] I would advise the SPD to get to its feet as 
quickly as possible and realize that there are only six months 
left to win the Bundestag elections. I think there has been a 
strategic miscalculation within the SPD. If you think you can 
push through your own presidential candidate six months before 
the decisive battle, then this is not very realistic. They 
should have tried to reach a consensus. The SPD should let 
things rest now and start a reform debate quickly. Scharping 
may be right in saying that you have to pick up voters from the 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. But the question is where do 
you want to take them. If you want to leave them where they are 
and what they are, this is not picking them up, but this way 
everything will stay the same. This is what the atmosphere in 
the country is like at the moment. 
  [Wischmeyer] Should not an important office in the state be 
given to a politician from eastern Germany? 
  [Vollmer] I find it a bit strange that this demand comes 
from those who have presented western candidates for the Federal 
Constitutional Court and the presidency. Next time round, 
action will count, and not good intentions. 
  [Wischmeyer] Scharping is rebuking the FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] for not yielding to the Social Democrats. That is not a 
good sign for dealing with smaller parties. What do you find so 
attractive in this partner of your dreams? 
  [Vollmer] Only that he is our real opportunity for turning 
green, ecological, democratic policies into government policy. 
But I would rather have a different election campaign. One 
that mobilizes society to effect a change in politics. 
  [Wischmeyer] A coalition between SPD, FDP, and Alliance 
90/Greens is out of the question? 
  [Vollmer] No, anything is still possible. 
  [Wischmeyer] The SPD candidate for chancellor likes giving 
your party the cold shoulder. He seems to expect the Greens to 
come into his boat themselves. Coalition by all means? Where 
are the limits? 
  [Vollmer] We will not take part in a government project that 
does not include a clear start to an ecological economic policy, 
and we cannot participate in a program that does not adopt 
principles of a liberal, foreigner-friendly domestic policy. 
For me, this includes a law on immigration. And then there 
must be a revaluation of work. 
  [Wischmeyer] Scharping's election program does not even 
mention basic ecological reconstruction. Is there another SPD 
beside him that is giving you hope? 
  [Vollmer] I have always expected, and I still do, Oskar 
Lafontaine wanting more radical changes in economic policy and 
also in social policies by the year 2000. There have been two 
election campaign models in the SPD. One of them was the 
Lafontaine campaign, which got very close to the Greens' issues. 
Scharping is now trying the opposite method. We will see how 
far this gets him. I for my part will do an election campaign 
event together with Oskar Lafontaine that will be entitled 
"Reform Perspectives for the New Republic." 
  [Wischmeyer] Does this mean the Scharping strategy is not in 
line with the SPD's potential? 
  [Vollmer] I would advise Scharping to form a sort of 
political twin with Lafontaine. I think that twosomes of the 
same sex have proved successful in politics, such as Clinton and 
Gore, Gorbachev and Yakovlev. You have to cover different 
positions. But you must also want to achieve the common things 
and must not use the other partner as an ornament. This is a 
good advice for everyone, including the Greens, even for Helmut 
Kohl, except that there is no more twin for him. 
  [Wischmeyer] What do you expect from the SPD? 
  [Vollmer] We must not introduce ecology via fiscal and 
financial issues alone, which is a point where people are 
particularly reluctant. There is more at stake. We need a 
second phase of railroad and public transport reforms. We could 
really be world leaders in ecological technologies. In social 
policy we must redistribute private wealth to take the burden 
off public poverty. And there is another debate: Half of our 
population will soon be over 50. What could a policy look like 
that would not have to ask people's children to pay up to five 
times as much as they did? Thinking about this also has to do 
with the dignity of old people. 
  [Wischmeyer] But there is not even agreement on very simple 
issues: the price of gasoline, speed limit.... 
  [Vollmer] If the SPD expects us to rethink our Mannheim 
resolutions, we can expect them to rethink their position with 
regard to the speed limit. 
  [Wischmeyer] You think that the SPD cannot be that crazy.... 
  [Vollmer] ...that this would be a stumbling block for them. 
There must be a bit of reason, they are all over 50 themselves. 
  [Wischmeyer] And gasoline prices? An immediate rise of 50 
pfennig, and another 30 pfennig per year, that would make 5 
marks by the year 2000. Is this still valid? 
  [Vollmer] I will not indicate any prices beyond the year 
2000, because this would be idiotic. But the 50 pfennig and the 
speed limit belong to the basics of transportation policy. This 
goes without saying. But this will only be possible if people 
realize that a change in politics is necessary. If the 
ecological question, the rise in the ratio of old people, the 
difficult situation worldwide after the end of the Cold War, are 
taken seriously. If we discuss these issues, we will get to 
agree whether we will charge 50 pfennig more for gasoline. What 
annoys me is that in a year such as this, election campaigns are 
about 50 pfennig peanuts issues. 
  [Wischmeyer] Unemployment will be an important topic in the 
election campaign. The Greens have not had much to say on this. 
  [Vollmer] I do not agree. I think you have to start by 
thoroughly thinking about revolutionizing the term of work. We 
must have a debate on basic salaries. Pension systems are 
getting insecure, the age structure creates problems of its own, 
and even economic growth will not lead to everyone getting a 
full job of the old type. It is, therefore, high time to say 
there must be a basic salary for all, which shall give people 
more freedom to organize their jobs according to their needs; 
reduction of working hours for all, in order to distribute the 
existing jobs more evenly. This is a concept where all elements 
fit into each other. 
  [Wischmeyer] A necessary element is more flexible working 
hours. Your party considers this the work of the devil. 
  [Vollmer] Elements that do not automatically fit together 
can be made to fit. I would like to see old taboos originating 
from Social Democratic and trade union backgrounds being given 
up. This will have to happen, if we want to reintegrate the 
unemployed and do not want to drive women out of gainful 
employment again. 
  [Wischmeyer] On your 50th birthday, Lafontaine wrote that he 
would prefer to see you holding a political office. What is the 
political office that Antje Vollmer would like to hold, if there 
was one for her? 
  [Vollmer] It is not within my power to choose. Politicians' 
lives are much more a game of roulette today than they used to 
be, especially for women. 
  [Wischmeyer] [Alliance 90/Greens politician Joschka] Fischer 
would be content with the role of backbencher, Vollmer would 
only sit in the third row.... Why are you so modest? 
  [Vollmer] Fischer will certainly not remain a backbencher, 
and I will not ban my own revolutionary ideas either. But I 
have become a lot more realistic where my very own perspectives 
are concerned. For a start, I just want to be part of the game 
again, everything else remains to be seen.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Seidlitz: "Triumph of the Realists"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton's decision to renew the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] clause will have a favorable effect on 
trade and cooperation between the United States and China. This 
is the gist of a statement published by the Chinese Government 
in Beijing as a reaction. 
  The business-like statement does not reflect the overt 
triumph the Chinese Government feels. A few days before the 
fifth anniversary of the clearing of Tienanmen Square, which 
claimed at least several hundred if not thousands of lives on 4 
June 1989, the United States has now also joined those who 
follow the popular slogan of "business first." The Europeans 
assumed such a pragmatic position a long time ago. Li Peng, 
China's head of government who held his own with his tough 
course in 1989, forcing reform-minded CPC head Zhao Zhiang into 
political exile, is expected on official visits in Austria, 
Germany, and Romania. That is realpolitik. 
  President Clinton decided that trade and human rights would 
henceforth be separated. This ends the annual tug-of-war about 
the renewal of tariff privileges. One year ago, the same 
President still linked the two issues and explicitly made the 
granting of preferential trade treatment dependent on an 
improvement of the human rights situation in China and Tibet. 
  Under the pressure of Big Business, the United States has 
now 
backed out and admitted its helplessness. After all, if the 
West is not even able to intervene in the cruel massacres in 
Africa and the Balkans, exerting pressure on China, which is 
bursting with strength, is absolutely impossible. 
  The renewal of the tariff privileges means that Chinese 
consumer goods -- such as shoes, clothes, toys, electronic 
equipment -- remain cheap in the United States. The United 
States is China's biggest market. Products worth $33 billion go 
from China to the United States. Investments and trade are 
helping China to modernize the country. In the best case, this 
will in time lead to political transformation. There is no 
alternative. Nobody can wish for political chaos in the 
overpopulated country. 
  Reversely, U.S. and multinational concerns, the U.S. service 
sector enterprises such as banks and bond houses, and even 
fastfood restaurants such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
Pizza Hut, and Burger King, are now hoping for big business. So 
far, as with Japan, the United States has had a huge trade 
balance deficit with China. The United States only sells 
products worth $8 million to China. According to reports, China 
is said to order 50 Boeing aircraft in a single mammoth order 
worth $5 billion in return, so to speak, for granting the tariff 
privileges. The resumption of military contacts with the 
objective of armament sales has also been initiated. 
  The U.S. business world is, therefore, satisfied with 
President Clinton's decision. And Hong Kong rejoices, too. 
After all, the bulk of exports to China is shipped through this 
city, which will be a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong 
would have lost enormous transactions. After this political 
U-turn, the Americans argue that changes or an easing of the 
politically tense situation would be achieved through economic 
relations rather than through political pressure. The slogan is 
change through business.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilhelm Dietl and Frank Siering: "Right in the </F>
Face"] 
  [Text] Adil Arslan, 33, from Krefeld refused to come. 
Then his visitor took out a 7.65-mm pistol and fired six times, 
several times right in his face. Arslan collapsed with severe 
injuries. 
  Arslan is a Kurd. The perpetrator is also a Kurd. The 
attack was ordered by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK). The brutal assassination attempt reveals the new violent 
methods of the PKK. Arslan was supposed to die because he 
wanted to drop out. Insiders report that the 33-year-old man 
"lost his faith in the cause of Kurdistan." 
  Arslan is not an unknown person. He was one of the best 
known PKK officials in Germany. With 24 of his comrades, he was 
charged with membership in a terrorist association and the 
criminal acts connected with it. In 1992, the Celle Higher 
Regional Court sentenced him to four years and two months in 
prison for severe deprivation of liberty and dangerous bodily 
injury. Arslan was released on probation. 
  Intelligence officers interpret the attempted assassination 
of Arslan as a clear sign from Kurdish leader Abdallah Ocalan. 
Even after the PKK ban, he controls his followers in Germany 
from Damascus, Syria. They are not to be intimidated despite the 
ban. And increasingly frequent attacks support his demands. 
  Flashback: In April, the PKK started militant actions 
against travel agencies arranging holidays in Turkey. It 
threatened personal attacks on German visitors to Turkey. In 
Bensheim in Hesse the windows of a travel agency were broken. 
Afterward, consulates and superhighways were occupied. The 
dramatic climax occurred when two women in Munich set themselves 
on fire on the occasion of the Kurdish spring festival. 
  In addition to this new wave of violence, a confidential 
analysis of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) 
proceeds from "increasing participation of German left-wing 
extremists" in the PKK actions. In order to give a "signal 
against the daily peaceful financing of the Turkish regime," 
autonomous persons glued the locks of several travel agencies in 
Hannover with super glue. According to a BKA member, 
threatening letters and letters with confessions from so-called 
leftist autonomous persons have lately arrived in the police 
headquarters in Wiesbaden more and more often. 
  The investigators of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Office of 
Criminal Investigation scored a success in the latest 
investigations against the PKK. Five presumed PKK members were 
arrested. The public prosecutor is investigating the suspects 
for, among other things, attempted killing, extortion, 
kidnapping, armed blackmail, bodily injury, and support of or 
membership in a banned association. 
  The men who were arrested are said to be part of a gang that 
collected "protection money" on behalf of the PKK. The police 
investigation group for state security/terrorism conducted 
investigations in the PKK surroundings for months. The result: 
In the greater Stuttgart area, the PKK men presented themselves 
to innkeepers and called on the victims "to donate money" in 
order to finance "the Kurds' struggle for freedom" against the 
Turkish state. According to the police, the required sums 
amounted to up to 50,000 German marks in the case of monthly 
payments. 
  If the innkeepers refused to pay, a raiding squad turned up. 
Armed with iron bars, timbers, baseball bats, and pistols, the 
PKK activists would wait for their victims in their apartments 
or near their cars -- and strike brutally. 
  This action against the PKK -- during the subsequent search 
of apartments the investigators found "receipts of donations," 
firearms, and knives -- shows that the PKK is still active in 
Germany despite the ban -- so active that their own people are 
also killed if they want to drop out. Adil Arslan can tell you 
a thing or two about that. He is still suffering from the 
severe gunshot wounds inflicted on him by his "friend and 
comrade."

  [Excerpt] Today was black Wednesday [1 June] for the ruling 
coalition in the Senate. The government coalition was divided 
over the chairmanships of the parliamentary committees and the 
previous negotiated agreements were thrown out the window. 
During the contest for the chairmanship of the public works 
committee the Northern League voted with the opposition. This 
was a bitter blow for the government. Of the 13 committees, 
three have gone to the ruling coalition and five to the 
opposition. The chairmanships of the other five committees will 
be decided tomorrow. Giovanni Masotti will explain exactly what 
happened: 
  [Masotti] Today was a day of upheavals and the unleashed 
political earthquake has set alarm bells ringing within the 
ranks of the ruling coalition. A summit meeting of the 
government parties has been called for this evening. Giulio 
Maceratini, the head of the National Alliance Senate grouping, 
has called for fresh Senate elections to choose new candidates. 
The Senate is the thorn in the side of the ruling government 
coalition. 
  The ruling coalition was unsuccessful in its tactic of 
trying 
to impose its will on the Senate despite the lack of an overall 
majority. Its tactic had, however, worked twice before; first 
with the election of the Senate speaker, Carlo Scognamiglio, and 
then during the government confidence motion. 
  Why was the government defeated today? One of the main 
factors in the defeat was the creation of a new Senate grouping, 
the Democratic Left, which has overturned the numerical balance 
and has sown tensions within the ranks of the Freedom Alliance 
by accentuating internal divisions. Furthermore, we are in the 
middle of an election campaign and stances are becoming more 
intransigent. 
  The strongest evidence of this intransigence came during the 
election of the chairman of the highly important public works 
and telecommunications committee. For days this committee had 
been the object of a showdown between the Northern League and 
Forza Italia. In the end the League's candidate, Erminio Bosco, 
was elected with the help of the opposition parties. In other 
words, all the previous agreements were thrown out of the window. 
  The same thing happened during the election of the chairman 
of the foreign affairs committee. Giovanni Spadolini had 
support but yet was unable to obtain the votes of the 
opposition--only those of the government. He did not obtain 
enough votes and a fresh election will be held tomorrow. The 
former speaker of the Senate immediately withdrew his nomination 
for the post. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has criticized RAI. 
According to the government leader, every year RAI spends 
billions of lire making programs which could serve as propaganda 
for the Communists. He added that it is always the citizens who 
end up paying for this wasteful use of their money. 
  According to agency reports, Berlusconi made his harsh 
comments during the course of a meeting of Forza Italia deputies 
which was held today. The prime minister was talking about the 
lack of efficiency in the public sector.

<F P=106> [Report by Gennaro Schettino: "Under 61? Lower Pension"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- You are under 61 and nonetheless want to 
quit work because you have contributed for the necessary number 
of years. OK, go ahead, but know that you will have a reduced 
pension. And the earlier you retire before pensionable age, the 
greater the cut. This is one proposal in the anti-deficit 
package which the Treasury technicians are studying with a view 
to the 1995 budget. 
  Other measures under study, largely concentrated on social 
security, include postponing the revaluation of pensions from 
November to January and a one percentage point increase in 
employees' and self-employed persons' contributions. But the 
package also contains a ceiling on redundancy fund payments and 
a cut in disability compensation payments to people above a 
minimum income. 
  With these measures the government wants to run for cover in 
the fight against the deficit. Even now, next year's deficit, 
according to the Public Accounting Office's latest estimates, 
could be pointing toward 180 trillion lire, if we include the 13 
trillion for financing the renewal of public contracts and all 
the unexpected expenditures, not the least of which is the 800 
billion in medical taxes to be paid back to taxpayers. Only 
yesterday National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini stated 
that the 85,000 lire decree [which recently imposed a 85,000 
lire health tax across the board] would have to be allowed to 
lapse. 
  Overall, the maneuver which the Treasury technicians intend 
proposing involves at least 35 trillion lire. The aim is to 
block the 1995 need to 145 trillion. And here the first problem 
arises, because the initial objective was not 145 but 128 
trillion, and it is not clear what the government will do to 
achieve its target of halting the growth of indebtedness as a 
proportion of gross domestic product. 
  The second question is how it will succeed in finding these 
35 trillion lire. The menu of proposals is still under study, 
but the Accounting Office has already prepared a list of 
measures. The heart of the proposals involves drastic surgery 
of the social security system. The starting point is the INPS' 
[National Agency for Social Security] need for up to an 
estimated 84-85 trillion lire next year, not taking into account 
the Constitutional Court ruling on reversibility pensions for 
surviving dependents, which could cost the state as much as 8 
trillion. 
  In its document, the Accounting Office warns in peremptory 
tones that "a reform of the pensions system which will achieve a 
containment of expenses immediately or in the short term and 
which can safeguard the existing level of benefits is 
practically impossible." What should be done then? The 
Treasury technicians are moving along two lines. 
  The first aims at obtaining immediate reductions in 
expenditures. The suggested measures are essentially three: 
First, the Accounting Office is suggesting a "ceiling" on 
ordinary redundancy fund payments in the amount "currently 
provided for by the extraordinary interventions." It then goes 
on to propose "unifying contribution rates for the Employees' 
Pension Fund at 35.50 percent." And finally, it proposes 
increasing employees' and self-employed persons' contributions 
by one percentage point. This final point is expected to bring 
in 3,600 billion lire of additional income. 
  The second line of anti-deficit measures provides for 
"suitable interventions to confront, structurally and at the 
financial level, the greater demands of the pensioner sector." 
As shown earlier, the Treasury technicians are considering 
postponing "the coming into effect of the pension revaluation 
from 1 November to 1 January of each year." This would produce 
cost savings of 1,500 billion lire. The second point of attack 
consists of retirement pensions in the private sector. The idea 
is to "reduce the pension amount in proportion to the number of 
years in which the person takes retirement prior to old age 
pension age." This measure, if approved, would produce savings 
of some 600-700 billion a year in the coming year. How would 
this cut work? Let us take a worker aged 56. Even if he has 
paid 35 years of contributions, his pension would be cut by 10 
percent, by two percentage points for every year he falls short 
of the present pension age (61 for men).

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso by Milos </F>
Sklenka; place and date not given: "The Poor European Union 
States Expect Solidarity From the Rich Member Countries"] 
  [Text] [Sklenka] Portugal is one of the poor countries on 
the so-called southern wing of the European Union [EU]. Do you 
give priority to intensifying integration within the framework 
of the current Twelve or do you favor EU enlargement? 
  [Durao Barroso] Intensifying multilateral cooperation among 
the current EU member countries and enlarging the Brussels based 
organization are communicating vessels. The two processes must 
take place concurrently without us giving priority to or 
accelerating one of them. 
  Creating a new united Europe on the basis of closer 
integration is the logical outcome of cooperation on the 
continent. The Maastricht Treaty on European Union, which has 
been signed and ratified by all 12 of the current community 
members, defines quite clearly the image of the future 
integrated Europe. Not only is the trend toward intensifying 
internal integration among the member states becoming apparent 
within the framework of creating a political, economic, and 
monetary union, but the rules for the future EU enlargement are 
also being defined at the same time. 
  The fact that the EU has now opened itself to the north in 
no 
way discounts its possible enlargement toward the East in the 
future. In the case of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway, 
however, it was agreed that their affiliation to the EU will not 
be linked to the Union's institutional reform. The talks on the 
admission of the East European countries -- which can begin only 
after the EU intergovernment conference in 1996 -- will, 
however, undoubtedly take place against the background of the 
reform of the present EU organizational structures. 
  [Sklenka] Realistically, when could such talks be initiated 
with the Central and East European countries? 
  [Durao Barroso] It is necessary to proceed from the premise 
that such a step can only be taken if the two sides are well 
prepared for it. Admission into the Brussels based organization 
will mean a completely new situation for both the European Union 
and the interested parties from the postcommunist countries. In 
our case, it is essential to ensure that the correct formula for 
institutional reform is found with the proviso that the EU does 
not lose its ability to function and operate, for instance, as a 
20- or 24-member organization. On the other hand, the candidate 
countries must adapt their economies and legal systems to the 
West European arrangement. 
  Specifically, the Czech Republic -- whose entry into the EU 
is supported on all sides -- must reckon with abandoning some 
jurisdiction concerning national sovereignty and also 
fundamental changes in its legislation, beginning with the 
regulations on domestic trade and ending with foreign policy. 
Of course, it is necessary to modernize and liberalize further 
the economy and to prepare the entrepreneurial sphere for a free 
competitive environment. 
  [Sklenka] However, opinions are sometimes expressed in 
Portugal that reveal anxiety about the rapid admission into the 
EU of the countries of Central and East Europe, because this 
could reduce the financial aid for Lisbon from the Twelve's 
structural funds, aid that would be directed toward the East. 
  [Durao Barroso] Such anxiety is absolutely unfounded. During 
the EU summit in Edinburgh at the end of 1992, a package of 
financial aid from the structural funds and the solidarity fund 
was approved as a prerequisite for the joint journey of all 12 
countries from the Brussels based organization toward political, 
economic, and monetary union. Within the framework of economic 
and social solidarity, the rich countries of northern Europe 
have committed themselves to assist the poorer countries in 
achieving the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty for 
admission into the EU. The financial aid for the years 1993-99 
has been fixed and is not linked to the EU's enlargement. 
  [Sklenka] There is no risk of a two or more-speed Europe, 
then? 
  [Durao Barroso] By signing and ratifying the Maastricht 
documents, all the European Union member states have committed 
themselves to economic and social solidarity. All of the 
prescribed parameters for convergence should be fulfilled by the 
end of 1999 at the latest. If someone were to cast doubt on 
this principle for a joint course of action now, he would -- at 
the same time --be repudiating the very essence of closer 
European cooperation and thus de facto be demolishing the 
foundations of the future federal Europe, foundations that are 
being laid only very slowly. 
  It is unacceptable to us for certain rich countries to use 
the cyclical difficulties and still extant differences in 
economic and social development within the European Union and 
embark themselves along a quicker path. That would, obviously, 
mean the end of the idea of pan-European integration and of a 
united Europe in general.

  [Text] Madrid, 1 Jun (EFE) -- A car bomb exploded today in 
Madrid near where a brigadier general in the Spanish Army was 
murdered an hour before. 
  The police noted that initial reports indicate the car bomb 
caused no casualties. This is the second attack to take place 
on Valia Street, in downtown Salamanca, which had been cleared 
following the murder of the general.

this morning are "salaried" members of Commando Madrid. The 
type of attack suggests that Arizkuren Ruiz, Aguirre Lete, and 
Soledad Iparraguirre Guenechea may have been involved. 
  These same Basque Fatherland and Liberty [ETA] members are 
allegedly responsible for the death of General Dionisio Herrero 
last October. Two of them may have committed nine other attacks. 
  Defense Minister Garcia Vargas has asked the public at large 
as well as the media for help in finishing off terrorism. "We 
fear the worst, that ETA has a stable infrastructure in Madrid," 
he added.

<F P=106> [Julio Riquelme report: "Gonzalez Avoids Linking His Future </F>
to 12 June Outcome"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday 
opened the election campaign for 12 June with an appearance on 
the Antena 3 television channel. On several occasions, Gonzalez 
was at pains to dissociate his political future and that of his 
government from the results of the dual European and Andalusian 
elections, acknowledging only that "if there is a catastrophe," 
there is a possibility of reconsidering the current situation. 
  In the opinion of Gonzalez, each election's results should 
be 
confined to its own sphere, even though some political forces -- 
which he did not name -- wish to turn 12 June into a primary 
election. Continuing this line of argument, Gonzalez denied that 
bad results could cause his resignation. 
  Previously, when asked about his state of mind with respect 
to the successive corruption cases, the prime minister asserted 
that "I have been in power for many years, and I know that my 
responsibility is to carry through our blueprint for the 
country, tackling both the corruption cases and the economic 
crisis." 
  Nevertheless, Gonzalez stated that "in the political sphere, 
my most difficult moment was the NATO referendum, and in the 
personal sphere, it has been these days with the corruption 
scandals." "I have no limits," he asserted, "in combating 
corruption, except those characteristic of a rule-of-law state, 
which it is very difficult to blackmail," referring to Luis 
Roldan. 
<H5>  Trust Betrayed </H5>
  After asserting, referring to the Roldan and Rubio cases, 
that "institutions stand above individuals," praising the work 
performed by both the Civil Guard and the Bank of Spain, 
Gonzalez reiterated that personal trust had been betrayed 
because of a lack of democratic controls, entailing political 
responsibilities which have been discharged -- referring to the 
resignations of Asuncion, Corcuera, and Solchaga. "It has been 
difficult for me to accept the betrayal, and I have had a very 
bad time," he asserted. "We resign," he said, in a clear 
reference to the People's Party: "Others do not resign." 
  Gonzalez said that it is very difficult to foresee the 
emergence of new scandals, although he pointed out that as prime 
minister "I have approved over 1,000 appointments of senior 
officials, and only two or three have disappointed me." The 
prime minister did not rule out the possibility that somebody is 
directing "a trickle of news" connected with corruption, stating 
that "some people do not even like the democratic system." 
  He showed himself opposed to the proposal made yesterday by 
Democratic Union of Catalonia leader Duran Lleida, for making a 
"fresh start" in the matter of party funding, since he deems it 
necessary for all citizens to know the origin of the parties' 
funds, and to create legal arrangements to ensure their 
transparency, involving an austerity which he deems necessary, 
plus increased powers for the National Audit Office. 
<H5>  Disenchantment </H5>
  The prime minister said he realizes that both the economic 
crisis and corruption, as well as the "lengthy period" of 
Socialist government, have caused disenchantment among many 
citizens, and so "it will be necessary to appeal to people's 
consciences to vote 12 June." 
  Felipe Gonzalez asserted that over the past few days, 
"rather 
than a political crisis, there has been political confusion, 
uncertainty, and anxiety. But it is very strange that this is 
being said by the People's Party, who are the only people to 
deny the country's recovery." Gonzalez said stability is needed 
for this recovery, and so in a further reference to the People's 
Party he described it as "crass" for them to say "the opposite 
of what even bodies and institutions very distant politically 
from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party are stating." 
  In the purely economic sphere, the prime minister asserted 
that the worst of the crisis is now over; "we will lose no jobs 
in 1994, and 1995 will be a good year." He used this argument 
to launch another attack on the People's Party for refusing to 
acknowledge the good figures and for increasing confusion by 
even asserting "that there will be a general election this year, 
when not even 12 months have passed since the last general 
election." 
  "We will win well in Andalusia," Gonzalez asserted, "because 
the Andalusians have no inclination to vote for the right." He 
denied the existence of a Rural Employment Plan captive vote, 
acknowledging that "patronage would be another form of 
corruption." 
  In a final personal reference, Gonzalez asserted that "for a 
long time several European leaders have been urging me to leave 
the Spanish Government and become the European Commission 
president. Now they are no longer urging me," he concluded, 
because "I have decided to remain in charge of my 
responsibilities as prime minister."

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana spoke to the 
Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress about various matters 
pertaining to his department, particularly the situation in the 
Maghreb and in Equatorial Guinea. 
  According to Javier Solana, relations between the European 
Union [EU] and the Maghreb are of fundamental importance. 
Javier Solana: 
  [Begin Solana recording] The strategic importance of the 
region for the Community is obvious. But if I had to underline 
it further, I would highlight three aspects: It is its third 
trading partner, with 8 percent of all its trade. [sentence as 
heard] This fact should be remembered, I think. 
  The area is vital for the Community's energy supply. And in 
third place, and to add another touch to this general picture, 
nearly 5 million of its citizens live on EC territory. There go 
three factors, so one can understand the strategic importance it 
has for us. 
  Furthermore, as we all know, these countries face very 
serious problems, economic ones, political ones, high foreign 
debt, high trade deficit -- sadly very high -- increasing 
demographic pressure, environmental problems, fundamentalism, 
etc. All of this means that they are increasingly complex 
countries. 
  The data I have just mentioned to you explains that Spain 
very forcefully wants the EU to review its Mediterranean 
relations in general, and EU-Maghreb relations in particular. 
We believe they should be higher on the EU agenda. We should 
manage to anchor their economies to Europe by increasing 
cooperation in all areas of development. [end recording]

  [Text] The conservative Independence Party and the Social 
Democratic Party, which together form the government of Iceland, 
were the big losers in Saturday's [28 May] local elections. The 
Independence Party lost its empire in Reykjavik, where the party 
has more or less reigned supreme for 64 years. The winners are 
the joint list of left-wing parties which won 53 percent of the 
vote and had eight representatives elected. The Independence 
Party won 47 percent of the vote and had seven representatives 
elected. 
  Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir (Women's Alliance), who won a 
great personal victory and is now Reykjavik's new mayor, said 
the result shows that the voters in the capital have grown tired 
of the one-party rule by the Independence Party and want changes 
that place the individual in center stage.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland under the </F>
"Perspective" rubric: "Our Welfare State Is Not Under Threat in 
the EU"] 
  [Text] It is not surprising that, in the debate on the EU 
[European Union] too, many people raise questions about what 
will happen to our social welfare arrangements in the years to 
come. This is something that has a central place in our 
consciousness -- and has to do with our feeling of security. 
The future of the welfare state depends first and foremost on 
two things: Our political will to give priority to 
social welfare provisions and our economic capacity 
to meet their costs. If EU membership had meant that we would 
weaken our welfare provisions, I would have been unable to 
recommend Norwegian membership. We in Norway want to decide the 
shape of our welfare provisions -- the system of social welfare 
payments, the health service, the care of children and of the 
elderly -- whether we are members of the EU or not. 
  The battle for the welfare state will be fought here at 
home, 
as it always has been. The Conservative Party's national 
conference this year gave advance warning that the debate on the 
choice between a lighter tax burden and an active welfare state, 
on the size of the public budget and the scale of our social 
welfare provisions, is not a thing of the past. Social welfare 
policy will always depend on our own political /will/ to 
establish priorities. 
  It is completely natural that social welfare policy is a 
national concern. EU cooperation first and foremost covers 
areas where there is a need for committed cooperation across 
national borders, areas where /joint/ decisions must be reached. 
Decisions which can best be taken nationally or locally should 
not be made at EU level. The shaping of welfare provisions is 
closely linked to the individual country's social structures and 
traditions. Decisions in this field need familiarity first and 
foremost and a knowledge of the people who are to benefit from 
the provisions -- and this requires a willingness to show 
solidarity and to work for a just distribution of resources. 
  To the extent that the EU countries can be said to have a 
common policy in the social welfare field, it is to prevent 
so-called social dumping. It is important to prevent individual 
countries from using poor workers' rights to attract investment 
in the competition with the other member countries. The work to 
counter social dumping has led among other things to the fact 
that the EU has told its members that they must give at least 14 
weeks of paid maternity leave. This has meant that some 
countries have had to increase their maternity leave. In most 
fields Norway -- and many of the countries that are currently 
members of the EU -- have better provisions that the minimum 
standards for which the EU has prepared the ground. But this 
does not mean that either we or the other countries with better 
provisions need to reduce our benefits. 
  Even though we are proud of our welfare model, we are not 
alone in Europe in having a highly developed social welfare 
system. The welfare state is a European invention. The 
majority of EU countries are welfare states with a high level of 
social security and a good degree of equality in living 
standards among the people. In all European countries social 
welfare is founded on the fact that the public sector has taken 
responsibility, even though the actual shape of the different 
benefit provisions differs somewhat from country to country. 
  Nor is it the case that we here in Norway spend that much 
more money on social welfare provisions than do other European 
countries. Denmark and Sweden use a larger share of their gross 
national product on public spending. EU members the Netherlands 
and France are more or less in line with us. Hot on our heels 
come Belgium and Greece. Indeed, Greece spends a larger 
proportion of its gross national product on public consumption 
-- that is, what we normally call public services -- than we do. 
  The fact that there is also variation between the different 
social welfare models in the EU countries is due to the fact 
that social welfare policy is a national affair. The fact that 
Spain spends a smaller share of its income on public sector 
welfare provisions than Norway does is due to Spain's history 
and the political choices Spain has made. The fact that Iceland 
-- which is not a member of the EU -- has an even lower level of 
public spending than Spain has is also due to national 
circumstances, traditions, and priorities. 
  It is therefore our own national political will which will 
decide the level of our public spending. 
  Nevertheless, the political will is not enough on its own. 
We are also completely dependent on our economic 
capacity to meet the spending an active social 
welfare policy requires. Here the same rule applies for Norway 
as it does for everyone; we cannot over a period of time spend 
more money than we have. We can borrow for a period, but in the 
long run we can only rely own our strength and the income we 
succeed in procuring for ourselves. The same applies to the 
welfare state. We actually have to be able to afford 
to pursue an active social welfare policy. 
  This is why the laborious and demanding work of putting the 
Norwegian economy to rights has been totally necessary in order 
to guarantee the future of the welfare state. We have first and 
foremost a national responsibility to procure for our country 
the income needed to guarantee social welfare provisions. But 
our ability to procure this income is also linked to our 
relations with the international community. We are entirely 
dependent on whether other countries are willing to buy our 
goods. As a small country we are especially dependent on stable 
international economic conditions. EU membership will give us 
influence in the cooperation which will shape Europe's future, 
and which will mean much for our economic development, whether 
or not we become members of the EU. 
  In order to ensure the future of the welfare state we also 
have to ensure an income for the public sector. There is 
nothing in the EU's rules on tax and duty harmonization which is 
an obstacle to upholding the level of public budgets. On the 
contrary, EU membership could be important when it comes to 
upholding the fundamental level of income for the welfare state. 
By giving Norwegian industry and commerce the growth stimulus 
that comes from gaining access to a market of 350 million people 
on the same terms as our European competitors, we are laying the 
foundations for greater wealth creation and increased income. 
Membership of the EU will make it more certain that we can 
afford to pay the bill for the welfare society. As a result it 
is not true -- as some people say -- that it is the economic 
arguments which speak in favor of membership of the EU, while 
considerations of social welfare policy speak against. The 
economy and social welfare are inextricably linked. 
  The challenge in the years to come will be to maintain broad 
popular support for public social welfare policy. Here we must 
also be capable of reforming welfare provisions when new needs 
make themselves felt -- in part because of the ever growing 
numbers of the elderly among us. People must feel that welfare 
provisions make a contribution to making everyday life simpler 
and more secure. Today a clear majority have, on the whole, 
ample personal finances. The path to private provisions could 
therefore be a short one if public services are not felt to be 
satisfactory. This will be one of our major challenges in the 
field of social welfare policy. 
  For me, the goal of securing the foundation for social 
welfare, alongside environmental and security arguments, is the 
most important argument for recommending a "yes" to EU 
membership. If membership had been a threat to our welfare 
state, I would have been unable to recommend the Norwegian 
people to vote "yes."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Carlsson I and II Did Not Exist"] </F>
  [Text] In five months Ingvar Carlsson could be prime 
minister. And in six months his ability to convince could 
determine the issue of Sweden's place in Europe. The Social 
Democratic Party [SDP] chairman occupies a strategic position. 
His May Day speech in Sundbyberg and Stockholm should say 
something about how he intends to play it. 
  In contrast to LO [Federation of Trade Unions] chairman 
Bertil Jonsson, Ingvar Carlsson did not evade the European Union 
[EU] issue. Swedish Social Democracy cannot stay outside a 
European cooperation for peace, against unemployment, and for 
the environment, the party chairman explained. 
  The day Ingvar Carlsson has the party executive committee 
and 
the party convention backing him as well, on that day he can 
appear with even greater authority in his argumentation for 
Swedish EU membership. The risk is that he nevertheless 
continues more or less like this up to the election, that is to 
say just mentions his EU position in passing at appearances 
whose temperament and overtones -- what the Social Democrats 
remember from the meetings -- are devoted to the fight against 
Bildt. After that, it could take a valuable month to form a 
government and get it under way. If so, there will not be much 
time for Ingvar Carlsson to speak earnestly with his people 
about what is at stake in the referendum. 
  With the strong support the Social Democrats have now had 
for 
20 months in the party strength polls, the party leadership 
should be able to take a few risks before the election so that 
it will increase its chances of winning in the referendum. 
Getting 43 or 45 percent in the parliamentary election cannot be 
totally decisive for the party, particularly since Ingvar 
Carlsson has said that he is looking for coalition partners 
rather than a single majority, but 48 or 50 percent yes in the 
EU referendum in November will make a crucial difference for 
Sweden. 
  The nightmare for the Social Democratic party leadership is 
to get sole responsibility for leading Sweden and right 
afterward to see confidence in the country collapse. That is 
precisely what could happen if the national election is won 
largely by keeping quiet about the EU position, but the 
referendum is narrowly lost because there is not enough time to 
convince one's own ranks. 
  A yes in the referendum does not solve Sweden's economic 
problems. What is self-inflicted must be self-cured. But a 
majority in favor of rejection could halt the recovery in a 
sensitive phase. Investors become more cautious. Buyers avoid 
Swedish Government obligations, with falling prices (equals 
higher interest rates) as a result. 
  The concern that under all circumstances exists, that a 
Social Democratic government will result in resumed inflationary 
policies, will be reinforced in such a situation. And in the 
event a Carlsson government is forced, as a result of a no vote, 
to compensate for both inflationary concerns and this 
uncertainty, it will be faced with major demands for economies 
in the January 1995 budget -- without in addition being able to 
afford to alienate big capital by means of reintroduced double 
taxation and personal property tax. 
  In his May Day speech Ingvar Carlsson did not make the 
smallest attempt at informing the audience about the complex 
international conditions that exist for the Swedish economy, the 
one economy in the world that is most dependent on a few big, 
global enterprises. "How could it go so wrong so quickly?" asked 
the former prime minister. His only reply seemed to be "Carl 
Bildt," possibly reinforced with "Anne Wibble." The course of 
events behind the crisis was forgotten. The prescription for the 
future was given as higher marginal taxes, no child-care 
subsidy, keeping every service in the public sector, and another 
90,000 taxpayer-funded jobs. 
  One should not simply accuse Ingvar Carlsson of playing with 
false cards regarding the economy. He actually seems to think 
that a return to Erlander is possible in the 1990's (although it 
is in curious contrast to his own observation in his European 
speech at the party convention in the fall of 1993: "If today we 
try to apply Keynes and Wigforss to a country, that country will 
ruin its economy directly"). 
  The deregulations, the tax reform, the municipal tax freeze, 
the major decrease in housing subsidies, and other elements from 
the Carlsson administration's last years in power are completely 
gone, erased from the history of Social Democracy. It is like 
the other day when KOMMUNAL arranged a "tribunal against 
neoliberalism"; the accused were primarily Bengt K. A. 
Johansson's municipal law, Kjell-Olof Feldt's tax reform, and 
Allan Larsson's hard currency policy, all pursued under Ingvar 
Carlsson as prime minister. Someone has pushed the "erase 
everything" button to a sensitive part of the CD-ROM disk 
containing the history of Social Democracy in government. 
  Perhaps this will bear fruit for the party in five months. 
But those who are knowledgeable should fear a backlash within a 
year.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA)-- Cypriot Foreign Minister 
Alexandros Mikhailidhis has stated that the report submitted 
today by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the 
Cyprus issue reflects the efforts the secretary general is 
making to work out a suitable formula for the 
confidence-building measures between the parties concerned. 
  The Cypriot minister told MENA that his country will study 
that report. He noted the importance of the secretary general's 
proposal to hold an international conference on the Cyprus 
issue, to adopt intensified measures to implement the UN 
resolutions, and to hold a meeting of the peace guarantors: 
Turkey, Britain, and Greece. 
  He added that the confidence-building measures will yield 
economic benefits for Turkish Cypriots, particularly if the 
Turkish Cypriot city of Famagusta is opened to both sides for 
the sake of touristic and trade development. 
  The Cypriot minister noted that the secretary general's 
report demands the opening of Nicosia airport to both sides. 
This will enable Turkish Cypriots to travel without any 
difficulties.

  [Text] Political parties have already made preliminary 
remarks on the UN secretary general's report. DISI [Democratic 
Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said the report ascertains for 
the first time that there is no political will for a solution to 
the Cyprus issue based on the procedures that have been followed 
for a number of years. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is 
blamed for the failure of all talks on Cyprus. Turkey is blamed 
indirectly. 
  Referring to the alternative proposals, Matsis said that 
based on the ascertainment that the Turkish side has no 
political will, only two of the proposals are significant: The 
adoption of measures by the Security Council for the other side 
and the radical revision of the approach for a Cyprus solution. 
He added that President Glavkos Kliridhis' proper policy led to 
the revelation of the Turkish intransigence and to the 
attribution of responsibility.

  [Excerpts] President Glavkos Kliridhis said that with his 
report to the Security Council, UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali made it clear that continuing the talks on the 
confidence-building measures is not an option. Kliridhis 
stressed that Butrus-Ghali has made a serious determination: 
that resuming the talks, either based on the set of ideas or the 
confidence-building measures, will bring no result because of 
the lack of political will by the Turkish side. He said the UN 
secretary general lists other choices. 
  In an exclusive statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation [CyBC] on Butrus-Ghali's report, Kliridhis described 
the UN secretary general's reference to the lack of political 
will by the Turkish side as the basic point of his report. He 
mentioned that the National Council will confer the day after 
tomorrow, and he will make suggestions on the next steps 
regarding developments in the Cyprus issue. He added that he 
does not want to comment on the alternatives that the UN 
secretary general suggests in his report because these issues 
will be discussed at the National Council and in talks with the 
Greek Government. [passage omitted] 
  British High Commissioner David Madden said a negotiations 
plan must be held now to select the best combination of the five 
alternatives the UN secretary general suggests in his report. 
In an exclusive statement to CyBC, Madden said negotiations 
will be held in New York and various capitals, including Cyprus, 
to find the best way to continue procedures. He said he does 
not believe that the talks procedures on the confidence-building 
measures have reached a deadlock. Madden finally said the 
United Nations must be informed whether Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas had anything positive to say in his recent meetings 
with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate 
special representative in Cyprus. 
  In a telephone conversation with our station, U.S. 
Ambassador 
in Nicosia Richard Boucher simply said the report is complete 
and will be studied carefully. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said the important 
thing about the Cyprus issue is whether Butrus-Ghali's report 
will make a new beginning for a correct solution to the Cyprus 
issue. The Russian minister referred to the Cyprus issue during 
a joint news conference in Moscow with Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias. 
  Kozyrev stressed that Russia and Greece have identical views 
on the Cyprus issue. Papoulias expressed the Greek Government's 
gratitude for Russian support on the Cyprus issue, which was 
among the issues discussed.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that the Cyprus 
report UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted to the 
Security Council was prepared with prejudice and condemns the 
Turkish Cypriots. 
  Assessing the report to journalists today, President Denktas 
pointed out that the report was drawn up unilaterally, based on 
threats. He added: The UN is trying to make its scenarios 
accepted by disregarding the feelings of the Turkish Cypriots 
and through artificial answers to problems. 
  Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures were 
sacrificed when the UN Secretariat General reached an 
understanding with the Greek Cypriots and turned the nondocument 
into a proposal. It is unacceptable, Denktas stressed, that the 
Turkish Cypriot side should be easily blamed in the report when 
it displayed so much goodwill. 
  Denktas stated that the report was announced before there 
was 
time to properly assess his meeting with Feissel. He said: The 
report hides several truths by claiming that Greek Cypriot 
leader Kliridhis is ready to implement the confidence-building 
measures. 
  The president recalled that Kliridhis accepted the 
confidence-building measures only for the purpose of tactics. 
Denktas also criticized Butrus-Ghali for having said in the 
report that he doubts if an agreement can be reached even if the 
changes demanded by the Turkish Cypriot side are made. Denktas 
added: This shows how the honorable secretary general views the 
Turkish Cypriot community and what kind of feelings there are 
between him and the Turkish Cypriot leadership. 
  Denktas stressed that Butrus-Ghali does not have the right 
to 
say such a thing. He added: Had they included the changes they 
promised us -- for the good of our people, as they said -- in 
the 21 March document, and had we rejected that, then he would 
have the right to conclude what he concluded. 
  The president said it is very regrettable that Butrus-Ghali 
is acting with prejudice. Denktas recalled the remarks in the 
report which say: At the end of one month of efforts to reach 
an agreement, we have lost hope from the Turkish Cypriot leader. 
  Denktas pointed out that during that month of talks, efforts 
were made to ensure that the promises made to the Turkish 
Cypriots were fulfilled. 
  Commenting on the coercive measures mentioned in the report, 
Denktas said: They have been using coercive measures against us 
in the form of embargoes for the past 30 years. Undoubtedly, 
they can do worse things. People who defend their rights cannot 
be defeated by coercive measures. If the UN does that, it will 
be the greatest shame for the UN Security Council. Denktas 
stressed that coercive measures would unite the Turkish Cypriots 
and the Turkish nation. This must be well thought of, he said. 
  On Butrus-Ghali's contention that the Turkish Cypriot side 
lacks political will, Denktas said: We have political will. 
This political will will be used in line with the 30-year 
development of Cyprus realities. It is our political will that 
makes us resist the Greek Cypriot Administration which has been 
recognized as the legitimate government of Cyprus for the past 
30 years. We have the steel will to sign any balanced agreement 
that is based on the sovereignty of two equal partners, and that 
does not weaken Turkey's guarantees. 
  Denktas pointed out that the report says that the Turkish 
Cypriots had bitter experiences before 1974, and that the 
current efforts aim to prevent the recurrence of such 
experiences. Denktas said: It is impossible to see from New 
York what can affect the basic security and political stand of 
the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas said Butrus-Ghali claims in his report that Denktas' 
stand will lead to grave results as far as the prosperity of the 
Turkish Cypriots are concerned. Denktas said: All this depends 
on the assessment of the Turkish Cypriots. The main thing is 
our political equality and future, Turkey's guarantees. We will 
continue to reject anything that casts a shadow over these. 
  Denktas pointed out that the two sides must come together to 
diagnose realistically and assess why the problem has remained 
unresolved for the past 30 years. The only reason why the 
problem has remained unresolved, he stressed, is because the 
guilty party has been accepted as the legitimate government of 
Cyprus. 
  Denktas denied the allegation that the Turkish Cypriot side 
ignores international requests. He stated that the Turkish 
Cypriots themselves complain that the international community 
ignores their rights. He said: If we are to be punished 
because we do not accept their pressures, the Turkish Cypriots 
can easily face this punishment. 
  The president pointed out that the report mentions an 
alternative to the talks on confidence-building measures -- 
talks on the 1992 maps and set of ideas. Denktas said: On 
behalf of all my people, I say a strong no to that, never. That 
package is dead. 
  Denktas stated that the confidence-building measures will 
not 
be complete unless the rights promised to the Turkish Cypriots 
are given to them. On the alternative of an international 
conference, Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriots would 
participate in such a conference only as the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus. We will never participate in such a conference 
unless our status is recognized. Also, we will reject any 
decision to be reached at a conference where we are not 
represented.

  [Text] The Cyprus report UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
submitted to the Security Council has been assessed at a 
high-level dinner meeting under the chairmanship of President 
Rauf Denktas and with the participation of Turkish Foreign 
Ministry officials. Republican Assembly Speaker Ayhan Halit 
Acarkan; Assembly Deputy Speaker Olgun Pasalar; Prime Minister 
Hakki Atun; Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime 
minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign minister and defense 
minister; Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy under 
secretary; and Turkish-Greek Desk Director Ertugrul Apakan 
participated at the dinner meeting held at 1345. Turkey's 
Ambassador in Lefkosa [Nicosia] Cahit Bayar and Turkish Embassy 
Under Secretaries Ethem Tokdemir and Berki Dibek were also 
present at the meeting. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said the talks 
have 
not stopped and will continue, adding that the Turkish Cypriots 
will wait for the Security Council resolution. Stating that a 
diplomat had admitted that the Vienna meeting was a maneuver 
aimed at getting the Turkish Cypriots to accept the map, Denktas 
said: This is a disgrace. 
  Pointing out that talks had gone on until midnight and that 
the impression given was that New York was waiting for the 
conclusion of the discussions, Denktas added: Nonetheless, 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali issued a report dated 30 May, which is 
obviously a biased report. We will resist coercion, Denktas 
said, adding: We have no other choice. Pointing out that the 
talks will not stop and will continue, Denktas said the Turkish 
Cypriots will await the Security Council's resolution. 
  Denktas noted that the approval of the Turkish Cypriot side 
is necessary for the extension of the UN peacekeeping force's 
mandate. 
  Pointing out that there is a Turkish community in Cyprus 
whose people have a democratic will, Denktas concluded by saying 
that it is not fitting for the Security Council to adopt a 
coercive approach which disregards the democratic will of the 
Turkish Cypriot and to say that punishment will follow if the 
decisions of the Security Council are not carried out.

  [Text] Greece has warned Ankara that its slanderous and 
unfounded accusations against Greece cannot coexist with the 
appeals for a climate of friendly relations. The accusations 
also threaten stability in the region and create serious 
questions about Turkey's role and intentions. 
  Greek Ambassador in Ankara Alexandros Filon conveyed this 
strong warning to the Turkish Foreign Ministry during a meeting 
with the Turkish deputy foreign minister yesterday. Filon was 
reacting to Ankara's accusations about supposed training of PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] guerrillas in Greece.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described 
the UN secretary general's report on the Cyprus issue that was 
released today as positive. Venizelos said that from an initial 
evaluation of the report, one can conclude that it is an 
objective document. The spokesman stressed that the blame is 
clearly put on the Denktas pseudostate and Ankara. In a 
diplomatic way, Venizelos said, we should admit that the Turkish 
Cypriot and Turkish sides are blamed for a lack of political 
will. 
  The Greek Government, Venizelos concluded, cooperates with 
the Cypriot leadership and will carefully examine the 
alternative approaches to the problem that UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali has proposed.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit Corfu 
during the European Union [EU] summit and will sign the 
EU-Russia cooperation agreement. Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou is expected to pay an official visit to Russia next 
fall. This became known after a meeting between Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his Greek counterpart, Karolos 
Papoulias, which focused on problems in the Balkans, Cyprus, 
Turkish provocations in Istanbul, and Russia's relations with 
Greece and the EU. The two sides reconfirmed their excellent 
political relations and their identical views on the issues of 
the Balkans and Cyprus. 
  Both ministers insisted that it is necessary to maintain the 
rule of the Montreux Treaty on the passage of ships in the Black 
Sea Straits. Kozyrev said there are some difficulties in the 
development of bilateral economic relations but stressed there 
is political will to improve this sector. He added that the 
establishment of an association of [words indistinct] 
businessmen is being promoted within this framework and 
Papoulias will have a meeting with them. 
  Kozyrev said he is grateful for the work that the Greek 
Government has done so cooperation between EU and Russia will 
proceed. He added that significant events may happen in this 
sector through the end of the Greek presidency. 
  Papoulias described bilateral cooperation on issues of the 
Balkans as close and said the two countries have identical views 
on ways to resolve the Yugoslav crisis. 
  The foreign minister will meet the Russian patriarch tonight 
and will discuss his initiatives for peace in the Balkans.

  [Text] Damascus, Syria June 1 (A.A.) -- A meeting of 
conciliation held recently in Turkey between the representatives 
of two rival northern Iraqi Kurdish groups was reported 
successful today. 
  Jalal Talabani, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader, 
described Monday's meeting [30 May] with Mas'ud Barzani, 
Kurdistan Democratic Party [KDP] leader, as `very successful.' 
  However, representatives of the KDP claimed that their 
problem was not discussed in full detail during the meeting. 
  Talabani told the Anatolian Agency in Damascus that claims 
that they violated a May 17 truce with the KDP were not true. 
  `A joint agreement was made in Silopi to implement the 
cease-fire,' Talabani said. 
  Talabani added that he would be happy to hold a planned 
meeting with Barzani, in Turkey at the earliest opportunity. 
  KDP officials said that they wanted to bring an end to the 
clashes in the region through democratic means and were hoping 
that Talabani comes to their region to sit at the negotiating 
table.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that it attaches great 
importance to eliminating the atmosphere of instability in 
northern Iraq and that the current atmosphere will only serve 
the interests of the terror organization. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman, speaking at his 
weekly news conference today, recalled that high-ranking 
administrators of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party met in Silopi on Monday [30 May]. 
According to Ataman's statement, at the meeting the Turkish 
delegation expressed its concern over the continuing fighting 
among brothers in northern Iraq, adding that the unnecessary 
loss of life should be prevented. At the meeting it was also 
noted that Turkey does not side with any of the fighting 
factions and that it favors an end to the fighting. 
  [Begin Ataman recording] From the very beginning, Turkey has 
attached importance to eliminating the atmosphere of instability 
in northern Iraq. Turkey also believes that the continuation of 
the current situation will only serve the interests of the 
terrorist organization. Turkey, therefore, wishes that a 
lasting cease-fire be achieved among the fighting factions and 
that the problems be solved through dialogue. Within this 
framework, Turkey believes that the talks held in Silopi are a 
positive step in this direction and welcomes them. [end 
recording] 
  Ataman concluded by saying that Turkey will continue its 
contacts with the factions involved in the fighting.

<F P=106> [Report by Tolga Sardan: "Iran Supports Turkey's Military </F>
Operations"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that four Iranian 
battalions have for some time been supporting Turkish military 
operations against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] 
militants on the Agri and Tendurek Mountains. 
  A MILLIYET correspondent has been informed that the security 
forces know that several PKK militants crossed into Iran after 
being pressured by the military operations carried out in the 
Agri and Tendurek Mountains over the past four months. Acting 
on that information, the Internal Affairs Ministry officials 
asked their Iranian counterparts to establish a "control line" 
[kontrol hatti] in the region. Earlier, the Iranian 
Administration promised to support Turkey's struggle against the 
PKK. This promise was made during the joint security committee 
meetings between the two countries. Considering Turkey's 
request, 10 days ago Iran transferred four battalions to an area 
in the vicinity of the Agri and Tendurek Mountains in order to 
maintain security along the border between the two countries. 
  Officials disclosed that the measures taken by the Iranian 
military forces along the border have prevented the PKK groups, 
which have sustained severe blows in the mountainous region, 
from crossing into Iran. A high-ranking official said Iran's 
support was very important for the "mop up" operations. He 
asserted: "Iran's transfer of troops to the operations zone was 
a second gesture by that country. That is an indication that 
relations between the two countries are improving on security 
matters." 
  It should be recalled that Iran arrested a group of PKK 
militants and handed them over to Turkey some time ago.

  [Text] Ankara, June 1 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman told a press conference today that the Greek 
ambassador to Turkey has denied claims that Greece has relations 
with the separatist terrorist organization, PKK [Workers Party 
of Kurdistan], in line with a recent Athens statement. 
  Ataman said that the Greek ambassador met with the 
ministry's 
Deputy Under Secretary Unal Unsal on Tuesday [31 May]. 
  During the meeting the Greek ambassador replied to 
accusations in the same manner as his government. 
  Two weeks ago, the Foreign Ministry summoned the Greek 
ambassador and asked for information from Athens on confessions 
made by a number of PKK members. 
  The terrorists, during their interrogation said that they 
received training in Greece. 
  Athens denied the terrorists' statements.

  [Text] Turkey has announced that the recent Cyprus report 
issued by the UN secretary general disregards the 
accomplishments made toward reaching an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures package. A Foreign Ministry 
announcement on the issue states that Turkey will not allow the 
Turkish Cypriot side to be unjustly treated. The Foreign 
Ministry statement is as follows: 
  The recent Cyprus report issued by the UN secretary general 
within the framework of his goodwill mission disregards the 
accomplishments made toward reaching an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures. Rauf Denktas, president of the 
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC], yesterday informed 
the UN representatives that if the planned benefits to the TRNC 
from the implementation of the confidence-building measures made 
in accordance with the agreement reached at the meeting held 
with UN officials in Vienna are reflected in the final 
agreement, then the Turkish Cypriot side accepts the map of 
Maras [Varosha] and the arrangements regarding access to Maras. 
The fact that the report accuses the Turkish Cypriot side, 
despite its justified and constructive attitude, of not having 
the will to reach an agreement is incompatible with the 
realities. This approach does not contribute to the efforts 
being exerted in Cyprus toward a solution. The principle of 
reaching an agreement on the island based on the will of the two 
sides and through free negotiations has been ignored. It is 
clear that a positive result cannot be achieved through pressure. 
  Turkey shares and supports the views expressed by the TRNC 
authorities regarding the UN secretary general's report. Turkey 
will not allow the Turkish Cypriot side to be unjustly treated. 
Turkey has always favored a realistic and viable solution in 
Cyprus and with this understanding in mind it has supported the 
positive and constructive attitude the TRNC has so far pursued 
in the negotiating process for the confidence-building measures.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, has described the report issued by the UN secretary 
general -- without waiting for the results and despite all the 
efforts exerted by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 
[TRNC] to reduce the conflicts to a minimum -- as unjust. 
  In a written statement, Karayalcin drew attention to the 
fact 
that the report was issued when the TRNC informed the United 
Nations of its positive views, some of which involved certain 
sacrifices. Stressing that the accusations leveled at the 
Turkish Cypriot side regarding its lack of political will, 
despite its constructive and positive approach, cannot be 
received with understanding, Karayalcin added: No doubt 
peaceful results cannot be achieved in Cyprus through an 
approach that supports the views of one side and pressures the 
other to accept the same views. The UN secretary general should 
not expect this approach to be tolerated. Karayalcin added that 
it should be known that one can reach a realistic and viable 
solution in Cyprus only through the free will of the two sides 
and through negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Lucian O. </F>
Meysels; place and date not given: "Turkey Is Pushing Into the 
European Union"] 
  [Text] [Meysels] The Kurdish problem and terrorism are 
currently dominating the reports about Turkey. Do you feel 
under pressure? 
  [Ciller] Unfortunately, most reports in the Western media 
are biased. As a result, the Western public gets a completely 
inaccurate picture. The struggle against terrorism is only a 
small part of the Turkish reality. All too often one overlooks 
Turkey's efforts for peace in the Middle East and also its 
function as a bridge between Europe and the new states in 
Central Asia. 
  [Meysels] What can you do yourself to improve this allegedly 
biased image? 
  [Ciller] Simply present the real facts. Turkey is a free 
democratic state, whose the government must answer to 
parliament. If more people could see Turkey with their own 
eyes, we would meet with greater understanding. 
  [Meysels] How do you assess Amnesty International's 
criticism of the Turkish authorities? 
  [Ciller] We see Amnesty International as a leading 
nongovernmental organization that has set itself the task of 
enforcing the observation of human rights. Unfortunately, 
Amnesty International does not always stick to its declared 
goals, particularly when the human rights of the victims of 
terrorism are involved. It seems as if Amnesty International is 
dealing only with those human rights violations that are 
committed by governments. 
  [Meysels] How much damage have the terrorist attacks caused 
to Turkish tourism? 
  [Ciller] No country in the world is immune to terrorism. In 
fact, one barely feels the terrorism in our country's tourism 
region, which is outside the most extreme southeast. 
Unfortunately, individual attacks are inflated by the 
international media. Regarding our foreign guests, Turkey is an 
extremely safe country for them. Losses were marginal last 
year, and we expect similar results for 1994. 
  [Meysels] Does rising fundamentalism in Turkey endanger 
Ataturk's secular legacy? 
  [Ciller] Since the founding of the Republic (in 1923) 
Ataturk's principles have been put into practice: secularism, 
democracy, and the rule-of-law state. For the overwhelming 
majority of citizens they are already a way of life. I do not 
believe that radical elements will ever manage to endanger these 
principles. 
  [Meysels] In particular, emancipated women are the target of 
fundamentalists.... 
  [Ciller] The policy of the fundamentalists is aimed against 
everyone who oppose their goals, be it men or women. As regards 
Turkish women, they play an important role in political and 
social life. It would be irrational to think that one could 
restrict women's rights. 
  [Meysels] How far have Turkey's efforts to join the European 
Union come? 
  [Ciller] Since the early 1960's we have had an association 
treaty, the declared goals of which is full membership. In 
1987, we applied for full membership, and the opinion of the 
(then European Community) Commission was positive. Now we are 
in the process of establishing a customs union. This would be a 
concrete step toward integrating our economy into the European 
Union and will certainly speed up our efforts for membership. 
  [Meysels] In conclusion, a question about the most acute 
conflict in Europe: What has Turkey done so far to help the 
Bosnian Moslems? 
  [Ciller] Turkey is doing everything in its power to 
facilitate a settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. There 
are close historical ties between Turks and Bosnians. We have 
recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent state and have 
participated in all international initiatives. The Turkish 
UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] contingent is 
standing ready... 
  [Meysels] ...while other states are reducing their troop 
strengths. 
  [Ciller] ...and its presence would make an important 
contribution to reestablishing peace and preventing the fighting 
from spreading to other regions.

<F P=106> [Christophe Lamfalussy report: "Di Rupo Shows He Is </F>
Different"] 
  [Text] On Monday [30 May], for the first time in Europe's 
history, two Italian neofascist ministers took the elevator at 
the Charlemagne building [EC Council of Ministers] in Brussels, 
provoking a candid and forlorn response from the Belgian 
minister of telecommunications, Elio Di Rupo, who is making this 
into a personal case of conscience. 
  Giuseppe Tatarella, a former member of the Italian Social 
Movement (MSI), which is now merged with the National Alliance, 
arrived at 0900 in the morning to attend a council of 
telecommunications ministers. His colleague from the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Adriana Poli Bortone, followed him in the 
afternoon, but she had already been through her trial by fire 
during a very courteous informal council meeting in Greece. 
<H5>  "I Do Not Forget" </H5>
  In the elevator they took, and in the nerve centers of the 
European building, somebody had put up stickers commemorating 
the victims of Italian fascism. The stickers said "I do not 
forget." 
  Nor has Elio Di Rupo forgotten, and he aimed to make this 
clear to his colleagues by reading a three-page statement in 
which be noted that Europe has welcomed -- for the first time 
within its walls -- a "political group which claims to be the 
heir to the form of totalitarianism that was Italian fascism in 
the 1930's and early 1940's." 
  The minister from Mons, himself the son of an Italian 
immigrant, took his place in the meeting room a good quarter of 
an hour late to "show his difference." A little earlier, in 
front of the photographers, his colleagues also avoided shaking 
hands. Mr. Tatarella sat down as if nothing had happened 
between the Irish and Spanish delegations. 
<H5>  The Politics, Not the Man </H5>
  In his speech, which he did not have officially published, 
Elio Di Rupo did not call either Italy or his neofascist 
colleague into question, but rather "the politics he symbolizes, 
the past which this politics evokes, and the reference it could 
be elsewhere in Europe." 
  To better underscore what separates him from his Italian 
colleague, he then cited the universal values of Europe, such as 
the respect of freedoms, democracy, and others "without 
distinction as to nationality, religion, or sex." Speaking to 
the Italian press, Elio Di Rupo was even more explicit. "I had 
to find the line between the duty of state and the duty to keep 
a clear conscience," he said, sweeping aside the criticism that 
he would work for the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party], 
which is in the middle of an election campaign. All the 
bilateral questions between Italy and Belgium will be dealt with 
by the administration or through the Foreign Ministry, he added. 
Only the Greek minister supported the Belgian statement. 
Moreover, in Athens Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
also regretted the fact that the arrival of the Italian fascists 
"went so smoothly" in Europe. 
<H5>  Italian Republic </H5>
  For his part, Giuseppe Tatarella, who has the rank of deputy 
prime minister in the Berlusconi government, is playing down his 
party's links with fascism. He sees the emergence of a new 
"democratic and popular" Right in Europe, and suggested meeting 
with the Belgian deputy prime minister to explain to him the 
"reality" of the National Alliance. 
  Rome, he recalled, is preparing to welcome U.S. President 
Bill Clinton: "I respect all judgements, from Clinton's 
pragmatism to Di Rupo's perplexity." 
  Today the National Alliance has overall responsibility for 
the MSI, a party which openly maintains the memory of Mussolini 
while playing the parliamentary game. Three ministers, 
including Mr. Tatarella, come from its ranks. Two years ago, 
the party -- which defines itself as "postfascist" -- celebrated 
the 70th anniversary of the march on Rome in 1922, when the 
blackshirts imposed the Mussolini dictatorship with the consent 
of King Victor Emmanuel.

  [Text] Canada will not link its future trade relations with 
China to the issue of human rights. Canada's minister of 
foreign affairs, Andre Ouellet, presented the government's 
policy on China in a speech in Ottawa. 
  He said linking trade and human rights would be 
counterproductive and unlikely to succeed with such a large 
nation as China. He says, however, that Canada won't ignore the 
benefits of increased trade with China. Mr. Ouellet said 
Canada's prosperity as a small nation depends on trade with 
China, but he says Canada will press Chinese leaders in private 
meetings on its human rights behavior. 
  Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien met yesterday in 
Ottawa 
with (Wu Bangguo), a member of the Chinese Communist Party's 
Politburo. Mr. Ouellet said meetings such as this will be used 
to discuss China's human rights performance and democratic 
reform. 
  Mr. Ouellet's comments followed accusations from Amnesty 
International. The human rights group said the Canadian 
Government is neglecting its commitment to human rights. The 
criticism comes almost five years after the massacre of 
democracy supporters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Amnesty 
says the situation in China hasn't improved since then.

  [Text] Mine-sweeping operations along the former inner 
German border will be completed by the end of the year. This is 
what a spokesman for the responsible authority in Magdeburg told 
DDP. He said the blasters were primarily removing plastic mines 
with loads of up to 200 grams. Between 1961 and 1985, more than 
1.5 million mines were reportedly laid along the former border.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rudolf Scharping, SPD president and </F>
minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate, by Jean-Paul 
Picaper; place and date not given: "Rudolf Scharping: The 
SPD's Moderation"] 
  [Text] [Picaper] The publication of your economic program 
did not increase your popularity ratings. Perhaps it talks too 
much about taxation.... 
  [Scharping] But this is not true. You have to tell people 
the truth before elections. We do not want to increase the 
general level of taxation and social security payments, but 
distribute them differently, with two objectives: social 
justice and encouragement of demand. We will reduce the charges 
which weigh on investment in order to create new jobs and launch 
new products. 
  [Picaper] But the Socialists have the reputation of imposing 
taxes. 
  [Scharping] This is precisely what has changed. If the state 
has new ideas, it must not immediately translate them into new 
taxes, but achieve them with the money it has and strive to work 
at less cost. We have promised to prevent any increase in the 
state's share of the GNP. It is currently 45 percent, which is 
much too high. 
  [Picaper] Do you want to reduce bureaucracy? 
  [Scharping] We have 18 ministries. Two or three could be 
eliminated. We will reduce bureaucracy and open the 
decisionmaking processes to the citizens. We want to modernize 
the state's work, separate politics from everyday administrative 
tasks, and speed up the delivery of permits for industrial 
installations and the marketing of new products. Our priorities 
are economic growth, protection of the essentials of life, and 
consolidation of public finances which are burdened by a very 
large debt. These problems will be easier to solve in the 
European framework, especially with France, than they are 
country by country. 
  [Picaper] Do you intend to create a special tax for 
rebuilding East Germany, as your East German colleague Wolfgang 
Thierse has suggested? 
  [Scharping] No, why should we dream up new taxes? However, 
Germany has lost its way under Kohl. There is some egoism in 
this. After reunification, the Bundesbank damaged growth in 
Germany with its extraordinarily high interest rates, which 
concurrently imposed a very heavy burden on our European friends 
and partners, particularly France. 
  [Picaper] Will you offer the finance portfolio to Karl-Otto 
Poehl, former president of the Bundesbank, who is a Socialist? 
  [Scharping] Unless I am mistaken, Karl-Otto Poehl disagreed 
with Helmut Kohl's government during the implementation of 
German monetary union. For many years he was a very respected 
president of the Bundesbank. Since his resignation, he has 
worked in a private bank. His judgment is very important to me. 
  [Picaper] Do you intend to give a ministry to Daimler-Benz 
Chairman Edzard Reuter, who is deeply involved in politics and 
who will shortly leave his post as chairman of his enterprise? 
  [Scharping] We are not speculating on the formation of my 
government. That will come in August. There are many capable 
entrepreneurs in SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] ranks 
with whom I have frequent discussions, including Edzard Reuter. 
<H5>  Stronger Franco-German Cooperation </H5>
  [Picaper] German production is going badly.... 
  [Scharping] Germany is experiencing many social tensions and 
regional disparities with some rich regions like Hamburg or 
Frankfurt, but also very poor regions, especially in the East. 
Our country still has major assets: its level of vocational 
training, the productivity of its industry and the quality of 
its products. It has weaknesses, like the other European 
countries: unfavorable investment conditions and much too slow 
a transfer of the results of research into new products. 
  [Picaper] And the European weaknesses? 
  [Scharping] They are to do with inadequate cooperation. 
The Germans and French are cooperating in aeronautics and 
space, but why not do so with regard to high-speed land 
transport -- the high-speed train and ICE [intercity express 
train]? We would be able to produce a joint product. We ought 
also to improve in the trans-European information and 
communications networks, especially in view of increasingly 
fierce international competition. 
  [Picaper] Do you intend to eliminate nuclear energy, as the 
Greens do? 
  [Scharping] We can abandon it, especially if we succeed in 
exploiting renewable energy sources which will be one of the 
growth markets of the future, solar energy for instance. There 
are ill-informed people who think there is not enough sun in 
Europe. In Japan and the United States, they have set to work 
under the watchword of "ecolution" -- a combination of "ecology" 
and "evolution." Europe must do the same, to avoid building up 
an irreversible technological lag. 
  [Picaper] Will the complementary tax of 10 percent on gross 
incomes higher than 60,000 German marks [DM] for single people 
and higher than DM120,000 for married couples with which you 
want to replace the 7.5 percent general solidarity tax be enough 
to cover the budget deficits? 
  [Scharping] The revenue it will produce will be the same, 
but, economically and socially, this will make a big difference. 
It will enable us to release 80 percent of incomes from any 
additional tax. We are suffering from a paralysis of the 
internal economic situation, and a marked weakness in growth. 
To overcome the two, we must create more demand and hence not 
overburden medium and small incomes. 
<H5>  Not Increasing Property Tax </H5>
  [Picaper] Will you increase wealth tax? 
  [Scharping] No, let us wait to see what the Constitutional 
Court says on this subject. We have promised not to increase 
the property tax for enterprises or individuals if it is 
allocated to retirement capital. 
  [Picaper] Hans Peter Stihl, the president of the Chamber of 
Trade and Industry, said that your inheritance tax will ruin 
many small- and medium-sized enterprises. 
  [Scharping] He is right. That is precisely why we do not 
want to increase it. 
  [Picaper] Last year, DM62 billion went abroad. Will you 
remove banking secrecy to improve deductions at source? 
  [Scharping] No. But, in Europe, we must harmonize capital 
tax. This will take some time. I have seen that it is on the 
agenda for the German term as European Union president which 
begins on 1 July. Theo Waigel has taken this objective. I am 
anxious to see the result. Moreover, we are consulting with 
experts to improve the German system even before European 
harmonization. 
  [Picaper] In France, there are a number of tax-free savings 
opportunities. I cannot see anything comparable in Germany. 
  [Scharping] In our country, life insurance is virtually 
tax-free. But I have told you that we intend to study the 
savings policies of other European countries to bring us closer 
to other systems first. 
  [Picaper] In our country, direct taxation is lower than in 
yours. The reverse is true with regard to indirect taxation. 
Have you thought about that? 
  [Scharping] I am aware of it. It does not just relate to 
taxes but also energy prices and other spheres. I do not want 
to make any predictions, because we must first assess the state 
of the treasury. We do not just have a very high public debt, 
almost DM2,000 billion, but also hidden deficits in 
supplementary budgets. Until we clarify all that, we will not 
be able to draw up a financial policy.

  [Text] The Netherlands says it might contribute troops to 
the United Nations force in Rwanda. Dutch Foreign Minister 
Pieter Kooijmans and Development Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk 
have told parliament that if the security situation in Rwanda 
improves, they might be prepared to send troops after all. The 
Hague has so far been reluctant to send troops because it fears 
that Rwandans might think the troops come from Belgium.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Smits and Mijla de Zwart: "Labor Party, </F>
People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, and Democrats 66 Agree 
on Social Security"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] "The party leaders of the PvdA 
[Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66], who are seeking to find 
a basis for a `purple' coalition government, succeeded in 
reaching `reasonable agreement' on Tuesday [31 May] on spending 
cuts in the national budget," PvdA leader Kok stated following 
the talks. "I believe we can go a long way if we continue in 
this direction," he added. 
  Talks between the three party leaders, termed "lively" by a 
spokesman for the politicians appointed to assess the 
feasibility of the various coalitions, are concentrating mainly 
on ways of cutting back public expenditure. The parties already 
agreed on the extent to which it had to be reduced (with the 
exception of social security). 
  In their election programs, the PvdA and the D66 planned to 
reduce spending by 6 billion guilders [G], and the VVD by G5 
billion, part of it through rationalization, allocating tasks to 
local government, and having people contribute to the cost of 
services provided by the state. But, whereas the PvdA wants 
cutbacks on defense, the D66 and the VVD want some of the 
spending cuts to bear on public housing and education. 
  The three party leaders completed the extensive talks on 
social security cutbacks on Tuesday without having yet reached 
an agreement. But their provisional agreement on a new 
implementation of social security does give the parties room for 
maneuvre in averting this stumbling block to a "purple" 
coalition. 
  The negotiators believe that a new implementation structure 
will help to sharply reduce the numbers of unemployed and those 
registered as unfit for work. This could be so productive that 
any substantial cuts in the actual amount of social security 
payments, as sought by the VVD, will no longer be necessary. In 
order to be sure that, whatever happens, there will be a 
reduction in the social security budget during the next 
government, the threat of a reduction in allowances is being 
retained as the big stick. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Jacques Wallage, state secretary </F>
for social affairs, by Bettina Hubo in The Hague; date not 
given: "Netherlands Welfare State Heading for Reevaluation"] 
  [Excerpts] For three weeks now, the PvdA [Labor Party], the 
VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 
[Democrats 66] have been assessing the feasibility of a "purple" 
government, a mixture of the red of the social democrats and the 
blue of the liberals. It would be an action of historic 
significance, a Netherlands Government without the Christian 
Democrats. Jacques Wallage, the 48-year-old secretary of state 
for social affairs and employment in the outgoing government, 
and the man generally regarded as the successor of PvdA leader 
Wim Kok, believes that the possibility of a "purple" coalition 
merits thorough investigation. He does not consider it to be a 
drawback that the formation of such a government would mean his 
party having to take the plunge with the VVD, his party's 
opposite number on financial, social, and economic policy. "A 
coalition is a marriage of convenience, not of love," he said. 
[passage omitted]. 
  According to Wallage, the credibility of his party need not 
necessarily come into play if the PvdA does business with the 
VVD. "In the years to come, both workers and employers from 
small- and medium-sized companies [SME's] must look to merge 
their interests. Together, they will have to agree on a package 
of difficult measures. If we expect a social pact to be 
possible in the economy, why should a political pact between the 
PvdA and the VVD be impossible?" he wondered. 
  Before it comes to this, the two parties will have to agree 
on how to approach the issue of social security. [passage 
omitted] 
  Wallage concedes that the number of people claiming social 
security benefits is far too high. Nonetheless, his party does 
not want to alter the size of benefits, unlike the VVD, which 
favors reducing most benefit payments to 60 percent of the 
minimum wage, with individual insurance on top of this. "By 
implementing the system better and showing greater 
responsibility, the main structure of the social security system 
can be kept intact," Wallage claims. 
<H5>  Bad Behaviour </H5>
  However, the precondition for this is the implementation of 
a 
good policy on job opportunities, combined with wage restraint 
and easing of debts. Moreover, Wallage believes that the social 
security system must be reorganized in such a way that people 
are given more responsibility of their own. "The present system 
does not always provoke good behaviour. Here in the Netherlands 
people can still receive a benefit, refuse work, and barely 
incur any punishment as a result. We have tolerated the abuse 
of social security provisions for too long. The existing system 
must be cleansed of those people fiddling it. Otherwise we will 
be running the risk of people who are now helping to pay for 
this solidarity no longer being prepared to do so in the 
future." According to Wallage, the difference between the VVD 
and the PvdA consists of the VVD acting as if it still has to 
launch the whole reorientation process, while the PvdA is of the 
opinion that the "cleansing process" is already under way. 
Wallage says: "We have come up with stricter criteria 
regarding work disability. The criterion of suitable work has 
been replaced by passable work. In the past, a teacher who 
became handicapped was declared unfit for work and was 
immediately paid a full work disability allowance. Now we are 
assuming that the same teacher can still probably perform 
another function, using his brains and hands. So he will 
receive a much lower benefit and otherwise classified as being 
out of work. It will then be his own responsibility to do 
everything he can to find a job in line with the options still 
open to him." 
<H5>  Employers </H5>
  [passage omitted] Wallage is interested by the proposal to 
help people find work via tax credits. "However, it is an 
expensive proposal, because the tax advantage does not go to all 
workers. That is why I am wondering whether it might not be 
better to let the benefit filter through to employers, who would 
then receive tax credits the more workers they took on at the 
minimum wage." The state secretary expects that the final 
government agreement will include a mixture of both 
possibilities. 
  Since a large group of long-term unemployed will still be 
left over despite all the plans regarding jobs and stimulating 
measures, Wallage favors creating subsidized jobs, with either 
the government or individuals. "The main problem regarding the 
long-term unemployed is that people forget how to work. 
Consequently, subsidized work, on a voluntary basis, is 
something not to be shunned." 
  Nevertheless, he does see a few pitfalls. "There are two 
things to watch out for: The falsification of competition, and 
the risk of the person involved earning so much that he is no 
longer motivated to move on to nonsubsidized work." 
  As a result, Wallage believes that the Netherlands welfare 
state must be reevaluated, and his party, which is celebrating 
its centenary this year, has an important role to play in this. 
The state secretary is also opposing the voices in the PvdA 
that are clamoring to join forces with other progressive 
parties, the D66 and the Green Left, and form a Progressive 
People's Party together. Those in favor of such a Progressive 
People's Party believe that after a century-long struggle for 
emancipation there is no longer any need for a separate social 
democracy. 
  Wallage's response is this: "I would always call myself a 
traditional social democrat in the sense that I find the basic 
ideas of social democracy to be totally pertinent to the present 
day. The party has to adapt its policies but the basic thoughts 
are sufficiently `alive' for us to look ahead to the next 
century with some degree of self-confidence." 
  According to Wallage, the emancipation of workers, the 
source 
of social democracy, has still not been completely achieved. 
"There is better access to training, and generally speaking 
those people with jobs have a reasonable income. However, the 
process of forming an elite is still under way. Consequently, 
there are still sharp distinctions culturally speaking. 
Moreover, the fact that a consumer society has arisen points to 
incomplete development. Emancipation does not consist of 
consumption, but rather production, making a contribution. That 
form of emancipation has only just begun."

  [Text] The ruling coalition is not only divided in the 
Senate; it is also being lacerated by a fresh duel between 
Umberto Bossi and Silvio Berlusconi. The outcome of this 
personal battle is far from certain. Rocco Tolfa reports: 
  [Tolfa] Allies and antagonists, Bossi and Berlusconi are 
united in the government, but Bossi and Berlusconi are also the 
eternal duellists. Their relationship has always been stormy 
and now it is becoming increasingly bitter in the run-up to the 
European elections. 
  Umberto Bossi says that Berlusconi is the restorer of the 
old 
regime and the leader of an opportunist political movement which 
Bossi compares to an empty box. Bossi has also fired a warning 
shot at Berlusconi: We will not defend the government at all 
costs. 
  Berlusconi is losing patience and says that those who 
believe 
in what Bossi says don't know anything. However, he refuses to 
be more critical because he says that he does not want to create 
tensions in his government and because he is convinced that 
Bossi's outbursts will lose the Northern League votes. 
  The prime minister then passes a pitiless comment: 
Gianfranco Fini is an ally on whim one can depend.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhirinovskiy Does Not Want To Be </F>
Called a `Madcap'"] 
  [Text] Russian Duma Deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has now 
put his foot down and is demanding that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and 
the Swedish Theater be tried before Helsinki District Court. 
  HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater are also being 
sued 
for compensation totaling around 14 million markkas. 
  The reason for the writ against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET is that in 
her column entitled "Bad Taste" and published on 14 April Jutta 
Zilliacus called Zhirinovskiy a "madcap" [galenpanna]. 
Zhirinovskiy considers the word to be synonymous with the word 
"mad" [galen]. He considers this to be defamation. 
  "This interpretation is completely incorrect. The word 
`madcap' is synonymous with the words `daredevil, adventurous, 
hothead' and is often used in the context of political 
activists," said Mikael Reuter, the head of the Bureau for 
Swedish Terminology and Usage. 
  For its part the Swedish Theater has offended Zhirinovskiy 
by 
using in the play "Mein Kampf" a speech of Zhirinovskiy's as a 
continuation of a speech by Hitler -- something which, according 
to Zhirinovskiy gives the impression that it is "the same person 
or an incarnation of Adolf Hitler who is speaking."

  [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said a 
short while ago that the description of events included in the 
UN secretary general's report is being judged as very objective. 
He stressed that for the first time the UN secretary general is 
clearly blaming the Turkish Cypriot side. Kasoulidhis also 
stressed that indirectly the report blames Turkey as it notes 
that the lack of political will is also found outside Cyprus. 
The main conclusion of the report, the spokesman said, is that 
for the first time it blames the Turkish side for its lack of 
political will and suggests the study of alternative ways to 
promote a solution to the Cyprus issue. 
  Kasoulidhis added that when the report was released, 
President Glavkos Kliridhis repeated that he would be committed 
to accepting the 21 March document if the other side would do 
the same. Kasoulidhis stressed, however, that it is now time 
for alternative ways to be tried to promote the substance of the 
Cyprus issue. 
  The government spokesman announced that the National Council 
will be convened at 0900 on Friday [3 June] morning to discuss 
our position.

  [Excerpt] Labor Minister Evangelos Yiannopoulos believes 
that national elections might be held in May 1995 because the 
Political Spring and KKE [Greek Communist Party] will not reach 
agreement with the government on electing a president. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos indirectly 
criticized the labor minister, stressing that the government 
always had the prospect of a four-year term. Yiannopoulos said: 
"National elections will most likely be held when the 
president's term expires in May 1995. I hope the parties will 
agree on the election of a new president to avoid new elections, 
but I am afraid we will have national elections." 
  Commenting on Yiannopoulos' assessment, the spokesman said: 
"We have repeatedly said, as can also be seen from the 
parliamentary and political facts, that the government had the 
prospect of a four-year term from the outset. Besides, the 
least of the Greek people's demands is political stability and 
on this basis it elected the country's government last October." 
  In a statement yesterday, during the presentation of a 
social 
tourism program, the labor minister questioned the other 
parties' goodwill (particularly Political Spring and KKE) toward 
a common candidacy (Samaras spoke about a premature discussion 
and Papariga about disorientation) and predicted elections.

  [Excerpts] Nusaybin, June 2 (A.A.) -- Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani entered Turkey, from Syria, 
today on the way to northern Iraq. 
  The Anatolian Agency's correspondent here reports that 
Talabani entered Turkey under tight security measures. He left 
Nusaybin afterward by helicopter. 
  During a meeting on Monday [30 May] in southeastern Turkey 
arranged by Turkish officials, an agreement was reached between 
representatives of northern Iraqi Kurds. 
  Talabani and representatives of his rival Kurdistan 
Democratic Party leader Mas'ud Barzani met and provided secure 
passage for Talabani, to northern Iraq. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman said on Wednesday 
that Turkey attached importance to overcoming the unstable 
atmosphere in northern Iraq. [passage omitted] 
  Ataman said the sides did not want to fight and agreed on a 
cease-fire adding that they also agreed for the passage of 
Talabani to northern Iraq via Turkey but failed to set a date on 
the issue. 
  Asked if Turkey acted as a mediator between the sides, 
Ataman 
said Turkey will do its best to stop the meaningless bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Report by Michele Cotta on poll commissioned by LE NOUVEL </F>
ECONOMISTE: "Is There a Cure for Euroskepticism?"] 
  [Excerpts] We should call a spade a spade. France today 
does not have, or no longer has, any enthusiasm for Europe. 
French citizens' disinterest is growing from one poll to the 
next, as is the fear that European integration is running 
counter to national interests. The poll carried out by Sofres 
[French Opinion Polling Company] and LE NOUVEL ECONOMISTE from 7 
to 11 May confirms this trend. Just one month before the 
elections, to be held on 12 June, 44 percent of the French admit 
that they are only slightly or not at all interested in the 
upcoming elections. Even more significant is the fact that the 
proportion of French people which has decided not to vote is 
rising. In late April, 50 percent said they would abstain. 
Today, in the midst of the campaign, 53 percent said they would 
not. Only 47 percent of French people have decided to go to the 
polls. Women are more hesitant than men, and those under 34 
years of age are more reticent than their elders. Workers and 
employees are among those most likely to ignore the elections, 
whereas farmers -- surprise, surprise -- are exactly in the 
average of their fellow citizens: 47 percent of them say they 
intend to vote. [passage omitted] 
  The following poll was carried out by Sofres for LE NOUVEL 
ECONOMISTE from 7 to 11 May 1994 on a national sample of 1,000 
people representative of the entire population aged 18 or more. 
It was carried out using the quota method with stratification 
by region, category, and urban area.

  [Text] Paris, June 1 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Wang 
Juntao, recently released from prison in Beijing, arrived here 
Wednesday [1 June] on a visit to attend a commemoration of the 
failed pro-democracy uprising in the Chinese capital five years 
ago. 
  Wang, one of the leaders of the brutally-repressed Tiananmen 
Square protests in 1989, was sentenced in 1991 to 13 years in 
prison, the heaviest term handed to any of the activists. 
  He was released in late April and took refuge in the United 
States where he received medical treatment before coming here 
for a few days at the invitation of the journalists' group 
Reporters Without Borders. 
  Wang is to give a news conference here Friday on the just 
published French version of the book "Like a Blade of Grass in 
the Desert," by his wife Hou Xiaotian, about her fight to win 
his release from jail.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Common Desire To Build a Military </F>
Transport Plane"] 
  [Text] During the Franco-German Defense Council meeting in 
Mulhouse yesterday, Germany and France reaffirmed their desire 
to jointly construct a large capacity military transport plane 
to be able to provide their armed forces with the necessary 
mobility. The military transport planes currently in service in 
Europe (Transall C-160, Hercules C-130, and Alenia G-222) are 
aging and no longer have the adequate capacity and flexibility 
for the military or humanitarian missions which the European 
armed forces must now fulfill and should be replaced from the 
year 2003. 
  The Western European Union (WEU), the defense organization 
which brings together most of the members of the European Union 
[EU], has commissioned a feasability study which should be 
completed by the end of the year. The European aeronautical 
industry, which is very interested in this project, has formed a 
consortium for this purpose known as Euroflag SRL, based in 
Rome, in which Deutsche Aerospace (Germany), Aerospatiale 
(France), Alenia (Italy), British Aerospace (Britain), and Casa 
(Spain) each have a 20 percent share. Three other companies are 
associated with the enterprise: Flabel (Belgium), Ogma 
(Portugal), and Tusas (Turkey). 
  German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed the need to 
entrust the major part of the development of the projet to the 
industry which already has the experience of the Airbus civil 
airplane program. According to DASA [Deutsche Aerospace 
Airbus], the requirements of the WEU countries are estimated at 
between 300 and 350 planes which could be delivered from the 
year 2003 and produced until the year 2015. The firm estimates 
that between 300 and 400 additional planes could be sold for 
export. The total development cost is estimated at $6 billion. 
The construction of the aircraft would make it

<F P=106> [Report signed "A.R.": "French Aircraft Manufacturers Want </F>
`European Preference'"] 
  [Text] The GIFAS [French Aerospace Industries Accociation] 
is happy with the Military Programming Law. But it wants Europe 
to start buying European rather than American. 
  The 1995-2000 Military Programming Law "restores our 
confidence," said Serge Dassault, CEO of Dassault Industries and 
GIFAS president. "France is demonstrating its determination to 
preserve its armament industry." 
  Nevertheless, the law also worries the aerospace sector, 
whose revenues (120.2 billion francs) dropped by 8.5 percent 
last year. Since the Military Programming Law favors ongoing 
programs, it potentially threatens research, where spending may 
fall by as much as 10 percent. "If we want to be able to 
develop new products within 10 years, now is the time to launch 
preparatory studies," argues Serge Dassault, who fears that 
"research teams and know-how may become scattered." Should this 
happen, firms will find it harder to remain competitive. And 
one government objective is precisely to boost competitiveness 
within the coming five years. However, this requires that firms 
be given some maneuvering room as far as jobs are concerned, 
Serge Dassault claims: "The government cannot ask us to avoid 
layoffs and to improve productivity at the same time." 
  While he would like to see France adopt "an procurement 
system that would cover several years" instead of the current 
budgetary one, Serge Dassault wants above all to be able to 
compete with the Americans on two markets: the export market, 
and Europe. 
  With regard to the export market, he requests increased 
government support, matching that provided by Washington or the 
Eximbank. As for Europe, he would like it to at least buy 
European at last. In the middle of the European election 
campaign, "we do not hear anything said about European defense 
or European preference," he notes sar. "Every time a government 
chooses to buy American, it is Europe that suffers." 
<H5>  Repealing the `Buy American Act' </H5>
  For Serge Dassault, this is all the more important since on 
their home market the Americans are protected by the "Buy 
American Act." On the other hand, "every time a need emerges in 
Europe, the Americans show up. This is completely wrong." 
However, Mr. Dassault can only admit that manufacturers have no 
real power on this issue. Decisions "are up to the 
governments." And the interests of governments are not the same 
depending on whether they have or they do not have a domestic 
aircraft industry. 
  This is why, for lack of a better solution, Dassault Vice 
President Charles Edelstenne, who maintains that "80 percent of 
combat aircraft in Europe are American ones," bluntly demand 
that the Buy American Act be repealed. Of course, anyone aware 
of just how fiercely the Americans have been protecting their 
aerospace industry will know that this has to be a purely formal 
demand. 
  But it is also a way of setting the record straight, 
because, 
as Francois David, Aerospatiale deputy manager and GIFAS vice 
president, pointed out: "While the Americans do not speak about 
American preference, they do enforce it; whereas while we talk 
about European preference, we do not enforce it."

Soldiers in the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Paris/Ceske Budejovice -- Two AN-26 aircraft with 
120 soldiers of the Strasice 23d Mechanized Battalion landed 
yesterday at the Clermont-Ferrand airport in central France. 
This marked the beginning of the first Czech-French exercises, 
agreed on by the [defense] ministers of the two countries, 
Francois Leotard and Antonin Baudys, agreed in Paris in April. 
The joint exercises are unique for both countries because they 
are taking place in both countries concurrently with each 
country using its own weapons. More than 1,000 French soldiers 
arrived in the Czech Republic last weekend. The exercises 
themselves, called Livradois, will begin on 7 June. The joint 
exercises are, above all, to prepare the Czech soldiers for the 
eventual participation in NATO missions.

  [Excerpt] General Jean Cot, the commander of the blue 
helmets in the former Yugoslavia between July 1993 and March 
1994, has decided to leave the Army, where his grade of Army 
general (five stars), the highest military rank, did not give 
him much more headroom. The departure of the 60-year-old 
General Cot, who still had one year of service to complete 
before reaching the age limit, was confirmed at yesterday's 
cabinet meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Delphine Girard: "Unemployment Is Still </F>
Increasing, But More Slowly"] 
  [Text] "I would not be surprized if unemployment reaches a 
threshold in the coming months and I do not exclude the 
possibility that it starts to decline before the end of the 
year." April's unemployment figures, published yesterday, seem 
to confirm the forecasts of Labor Minister Michel Giraud. 
  The number of job seekers is continuing to increase, up 0.1 
percent last month, with 4,900 more people registered with the 
ANPE [National Employment Agency] in one month. But the rate of 
increase is far slower than last year. Over the first four 
months of the year 23,500 more job seekers were registered 
compared with 111,100 in the same period in 1993. "The average 
monthly increase is about 6,000, whereas it was 30,000 a month 
last year," the labor minister said, very pleased. "I will 
never forget the first unemployment figure I had to discuss when 
I took over my ministerial position last year," Giraud said. 
"In a single month, 45,600 more unemployed people: That was 
the figure for April 1993." 
  The government has no doubts in explaining the improvement. 
"Companies are starting to anticipate the effect of growth," the 
labor minister explained. The recovery in activity, shown by 
the improvement in the main economic indicators, is pushing some 
companies to again recruit new workers, as confirmed by the 
large increase in job offers sent to the ANPE in recent months. 
The job offers recorded by the Agency are up 46.3 percent from 
a year ago. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who had said he 
wished to see unemployment stabilized before the end of the 
year, is in the process of winning his bet. 
  But no doubt one should be careful not to cry victory 
prematurely. Certainly, given the importance of employment in 
the presidential election debates, the government will make 
considerable use of any improvement in unemployment figures in 
the coming months. For example the announcement of a net 
increase of 20,000 salaried jobs in the first quarter has been 
commented in detail by the government. 
  The news was certainly important because, since 1990, 
salaried employment had fallen continually. But it cannot paper 
over the fact that France lost close to 500,000 jobs in 1992 and 
1993. The slower rate of increase in unemployment must not hide 
the large number of job seekers stagnating in the ANPE's files. 
France had 3,325,800 job seekers at the end of April in figures 
adjusted for seasonal variations. Unemployment currently 
affects 12.3 percent of the working population. An analysis of 
the statistics shows that the situation remains extremely 
fragile. 
  Whereas the number of people coming on to the ANPE's books 
due to economic redundancy had been dropping since summer 1993, 
in April it suddenly increased by 9.3 percent to affect 43,600 
people (seasonally corrected figures). 
  Experts are wondering about the real impact of the recovery 
on unemployment. Past experience shows that it generally takes 
between nine and 18 months before renewed growth translates into 
new jobs. There is no doubt that the panoply of measures taken 
by the Balladur government since summer 1993 to encourage youth 
employment, including bonuses and social security charge 
reductions, has pushed companies to anticipate the recovery. 
Nor should the additional funding granted to increase the CES 
(employment solidarity contracts) be forgotten. 
  But these policies have another side to them. By targeting 
aid on young people, the government is discouraging the 
employment of older people. In April job applications by young 
people aged below 25 dropped by 0.7 percent whereas they 
increased by 0.5 percent by people aged between 25 and 49. The 
increase in long-term unemployment is just as worrying. The 
number of job seekers who have been on the ANPE's books for more 
than a year has increased to 1,142,500, in other words an 
increase of 1.6 percent over a month and 23 percent over a year. 
Long-term unemployed today represent 34.7 percent of all job 
seekers and the average duration of unemployment is 379 days, or 
28 days more than a year ago. 
  The government cannot ignore the gravity of the situation. 
Even if renewed growth does bring some improvements on the 
employment front in the coming months, the advent of a two-tier 
population with an increasing number of the socially excluded 
threatens the long-term cohesion of French society.

Security Zone at Kagbayi"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) New York, June 1 -- The Holy See on Wednesday 
[1 June] asked the United Nations Security Council to set up a 
security zone around Kabgayi, the religious community in 
southwestern Rwanda where an estimated 38,000 refugees of the 
Tutsi tribe have sought shelter from Hutu militias. 
  "To save 38,000 lives, the UN must declare Kabgayi a 
security 
zone and must ban the entry of armed units there," the Vatican's 
UN representative, Renato Raffaele Martino, said.

  [Text] New York (DPA) -- German Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer has given a positive view of the two-week session of the 
UN Commission on Sustainable Development that he chaired. In an 
interview with DPA at the end of the discussions in New York on 
27 May, the minister said it was a success that proposals for 14 
areas had been worked out -- ranging from financing and 
technology transfer to sectors like water or chemicals. 
  He said, however, that private organizations wanting a more 
intensive environmental and development policy criticized the 
fact that the many words are still not followed by deeds. This 
was urgently necessary both at the national and international 
levels and had not been dealt with in New York either. 
  Toepfer said the developing countries had, "in particular, 
urged" "a change in the consumption habits of the industrialized 
nations." He said the Commission's work would be continued under 
his chairmanship for a whole year, and to this end, the policy 
course had been set. He said that good use had to be made of 
this year in order to consolidate the profile and decisionmaking 
power of the institution. 
  Regarding the preservation of forests, "we must and can make 
progress and achieve more than we did in Rio," he said. The 
Commission was created to convert the resolutions adopted at the 
summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 into concrete action. The goal 
remained an international convention for the preservation of all 
forests in the world: "This is a heavily burdened field. Many 
people in the developing countries believe that the developed 
countries interfere in their own internal affairs and disregard 
their sovereignty. I believe, however, that something has 
changed here." 
  The minister described his work in New York as "incredibly 
labor-intensive, difficult, and tough" -- even though the UN 
bureaucracy had demonstrated much goodwill. "The largest 
problems are clearly financial ones," he said, and added that 
the developing countries emphatically mentioned the fact that 
"new, predictable financial measures" had been promised in Rio. 
  Commenting on the meeting, German observers from 
environmental groups and development initiatives said that 
"hardly any progress" had been made in New York. "As long as 
the governments confine themselves to continuously repeating 
noncommittal appeals and are not prepared to assume concrete 
political obligations, there is the great danger that the whole 
Rio process will come to nothing."

  [Text] Mulhouse (DPA) -- Germany and France want to make 
armament cooperation even more effective. During their 
discussions in Mulhouse on Tuesday [31 May] the two defense 
ministers, Volker Ruehe and Francois Leotard, came out in favor 
of building a new military cargo plane. The experience of the 
civilian aircraft producer Airbus Industries are to be used in 
this venture. 
  There is "a strategic demand" for the new cargo plane, which 
is to have a greater range than the current planes with a view 
to international missions, German delegation circles said. A 
study on the plans will be drawn up in the Western European 
Union by next year.

<F P=106> [Article signed MTH/ALB/GGD: "Troika: Algerian </F>
Government's Sincere Will To Initiate Reforms"] 
  [Text] Algiers, 30 May (BELGA) -- "We are coming back to 
Belgium with the firm belief that the Algerian Government is 
determined to reinforce the national political dialogue and to 
proceed with its economic reform program," Belgian Foreign 
Minister Claes said in Algiers on Monday [30 May], after a round 
of talks between the European Troika (past, present, and future 
presidents of the European Union [EU]) and the Algerian 
authorities. "The meeting was an instructive and a constructive 
one," Mr. Claes added. 
  The Troika (which also includes the head of the Belgian 
Foreign Ministry, the Greek and German state secretaries for 
foreign affairs, Messrs. Kaltrut and Papandreou, respectively, 
and European Commissioner for External Relations Hans van den 
Broek) is to report on the political, economic, and social 
situation of Algeria before the Twelve in the context of 
European financial support for that country's economic recovery. 
The EU wants to contribute to the political stability of that 
country, which has endured Islamic violence. 
  At a press conference, Mr. Papandreou welcomed the Algerian 
Government's sincere will to take up the political and economic 
challenge. "This sincere will is the basis of a successful 
cooperation between the EU and the Algerian Government," he 
added. 
  The EU representatives who met with the Algerian Prime 
Minister Mr. Mokvad Sifi, Foreign Ministry head Salah Bendri, 
and President Lianine Zerouan had a message of support for the 
ongoing reforms in Algeria. "We want you to know that Europe is 
on your side and supports your reforms," Mr. Papandreou said. 
He also firmly condemned violence and terrorism and called for 
the respect of human rights. 
  Besides the political message, the Twelve have recently 
earmarked ECU150 million for Algeria (as the second part of a 
larger credit of ECU400 million aimed at sustaining the Algerian 
balance of payments) and should soon grant another ECU200 
million which has already been approved in principle by the EU 
finance ministers. 
  A group of European experts is expected in Algiers next 
month 
to examine the terms and conditions for implementing the 
economic recovery program. Algeria also wants to conclude a 
partnership agreement with the EU, similar to that between the 
Twelve and Morocco and Tunisia. The Algerian foreign minister 
hopes that this will lead to the creation of a free-trade zone. 
  "We are anxiously waiting for a decisive step to be made in 
favor of Algeria at the Corfu Summit," he added. 
  Mr. Bendri said that Algeria had "turned its back on those 
who have hindered its development so far" and that it was 
heading for a democratic, pluralistic society which is open to 
democracy and solidarity. He expressed the desire that "all 
political and social forces that reject terrorism should adhere 
to the principle of a pluralistic society that respects human 
rights and take part in the national dialogue to prepare the 
future together." 
  Furthermore, the Algerian minister invited the international 
human rights organizations to come to see for themselves how the 
Algerian authorities are ensuring their implementation.

 Seek 
Cooperation in Energy"] 
  [Text] Mr. Marcelino Oreja, European Commissioner for 
energy and transport, will participate in an international 
conference to be held in Chalkidiki, Greece on 30 and 31 May, 
entitled "New Energy Realities in the Black Sea region." 
  This conference has a view to developing cooperation in the 
field of energy between the EU [European Union] and the Black 
Sea region countries, paving the way for European Energy 
industry and opening up Union markets to these rapidly 
developing economies. 
  It is the first time the EU and the member states of the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation, (BSEC) (Albania, 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, 
Romania, Russia, Turkey, and the Ukraine) meet at ministerial 
level to discuss and coordinate aspects of energy policy. In 
addition, the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan will take part in the 
conference. Delegations will normally be led by ministers but 
in some cases by vice premiers. 
  The delegates will be addressed by Commissioner Marcelino 
Oreja as well as the president of the Council of Ministers 
(energy) Kostantinos Simitos. 
  The conference will focus on energy policy coordination and 
opportunities for cooperation in the areas of investment, trade, 
and transit, environment protection, security of supply and the 
implementation of the European energy charter. At the business 
level, bilateral and multilateral meetings between senior 
representatives from banks, industry, and energy companies have 
been arranged. The conference's organisers, the 
directorate-general for energy, led by Director General 
Constantinos Maniatopoulos, expect a successful outcome, 
including concrete projects for cooperation involving the EU, 
its member states and the Black Sea countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Energy Council </F>
Definitively Adopts Directive on Hydro-Fuels"] 
  [Text] The "Energy" Council adopted without debate on 
Wednesday [25 May] the directive on the conditions for granting 
and exercising authorizations to prospect, explore, and produce 
hydrofuels. 
  The main aim of this directive (adopted under the 
co-decision 
procedure with the EP) is to assure nondiscriminatory access to 
activities and thus promote competition in the sector. The 
principle adopted is that Member States own the sovereignty and 
sovereign rights to their hydrofuels resources (situated on 
their territory); national authorities consequently retain the 
right to designate those parts of their territories where 
prospection and exploitation can take place. But, each time an 
area is opened to the exercise of these activities, the Member 
State will be held responsible for ensuring that there is no 
discrimination between the different operators interested in 
access. The States will, however, be allowed to refuse, for 
"national security" reasons, access to operators which are 
effectively controlled by third countries or nationals of third 
countries. The States will have to conform to this directive at 
latest by 1 January 1995; the new authorizations granted by 
Denmark before 31 December 2012 are the subject of certain 
exemptions.

<F P=106> ["GGD/MJN" report: "Air Force To `Armor' Cockpit of C-130 </F>
Aircraft"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 24 May (BELGA) -- The Air Force, which has 
been facing growing threats posed by light weapons to its 
transport aircraft, has decided to enhance the safety of the 
crew in the cockpit of the C-130 aircraft, said a military 
source on Tuesday [24 May]. 
  The Air Force will thus purchase four sets of kevlar plates, 
a light and resistant material, which will be used to protect 
the crew of the "Hercules" C-130 aircraft of the 15th Airborne 
Transport Division when overflying zones from where they may be 
fired at with light weapons. In addition, all aircraft will be 
equipped with anchor points so that the plates can be easily 
fitted if necessary. 
  Military sources remind that three C-130 were hit by bullets 
during the "Silver Back" and "Blue Safari" operations 
[evacuation of Belgian nationals and UN troops from Rwanda] last 
month. Moreover, the Belgian planes that sometimes fly to 
Sarajevo are the only ones not to be equipped with a protection 
system, said a pilot. 
  Several countries like the United States and Great Britain 
have been using different systems to protect the aircraft crews. 
  The Belgian Air Force has thus decided to acquire a similar 
protection. It earmarked 25 million Belgian francs to purchase 
four kits and to have anchor points installed on its 12 
aircraft. "Still, we will have to find the means to equip more 
planes," said General Major Wilfried de Brouwer, deputy Air 
Force chief of staff. 
  The procurement request has been made and the first 
deliveries are expected before the end of this year. 
  In addition, the Air Force is implementing the last phase of 
the modernization of its C-130 aircraft, which should make it 
possible for them to remain operational until the year 2010, 
i.e., 30 years after they were introduced. A new avionics 
system (electronic navigation system) is to replace the 
traditional navigation instruments which were designed in the 
sixties. Military sources said that the aircraft prototype is 
being transformed in the Sabena workshops at Brussels National 
Airport. It should be ready to fly by the fall to perform the 
necessary tests before it can be put into service.

<F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Overview of Party Programs"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 27 May (BELGA) -- Christian 
People's Party (CVP): The CVP, "more than ever," is 
advocating a united Europe. The Flemish christian democrats feel 
that the Maastricht Treaty is just an intermediate step. They 
want to go much further, because they feel that attacking 
unemployment, reviving the economy, making the environment 
healthy, and guaranteeing peace and security can only be 
achieved within the framework of the European Union (EU). 
  The party's aim is not a free trade zone, but a democratic, 
federal, and political union with a bigger role for the European 
Parliament (EP). The EP must be put on an equal footing with 
the Council of Ministers, which must be expanded to include a 
second chamber. All this must be enshrined in a European 
constitution. In order to achieve a strong economy, the CVP 
wants Europe to forge an Economic and Monetary Union, with a 
common currency. In order to stimulate employment, the CVP 
advocates the reduction of labor costs and the implementation of 
the white paper. 
  A powerful social policy must be followed. The social and 
fiscal systems of the member states must be better geared toward 
each other. The economy must work in an ecologically 
responsible manner. Moreover, the CVP wants a powerful foreign 
and security policy, a European approach to organized crime and 
drug trafficking, and a harmonized refugee policy. The CVP 
feels that it is more important to deepen the EU than enlarge 
it. [passage omitted] 
  Socialist Party (SP): As far as Europe goes, the 
SP is opting for the lesser evil. The SP accepted the 
Maastricht Treaty since it preferred an all too liberal Europe 
to the threat of a nationalistic Europe. According to the 
social democrats, the Maastricht Treaty contains a lot more, 
however, than a stringent reorganization of government finances. 
They say that "more Europe" is needed to make unemployment 
fall, to close all the tax loopholes, to halt cross-border 
pollution and crime, and to make provisions for refugees. 
  The SP also advocates "another" Europe: A tolerant, 
democratic, and federal union based on a strong EP and smoothly 
working European social consultation process. More attention 
must be paid to the redistribution of labor. This recovery plan 
must also be corrected in social and ecological terms. Labor 
must be taxed less and environmental pollution taxed more. 
Social exclusion and social dumping must be combatted fiercely. 
  The SP also advocates a radical approach to fraud and more 
fiscal justice. At a time when the European governments are 
reorganizing with a view to the creation of a Monetary Union, 
income from capital should be regulated at European level. In 
addition, the SP wants an active foreign and security policy. 
The SP feels that the EU enlargement must go hand in hand with 
further deepening. 
  Flemish Bloc (VB): The VB wants to have "great 
virtue" in Europe. The "pervasive meddlesomeness" and the 
"pressure for harmonization" of the European bureaucracy must be 
driven back. The broadening of the EU's powers, as set out in 
the Maastricht Treaty, including in the areas of education and 
culture, must be reduced, and the EP may not receive any 
additional powers. The VB has adopted an anti-European stance. 
  Instead of giving priority to economic and monetary affairs, 
Europe must put the emphasis on the "cultural character" of its 
peoples. The party, which says it favors more political 
respectability, wants to send "non-European guest workers back 
to their country of origin." Stringent measures must be taken 
to combat crime and drug-related crime in a Europe without 
internal borders. Only an independent Flanders, which should 
receive 15 seats in the EP, can defend Flemish interests in 
Europe. In order to counteract the spread of French language 
versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, the European 
institutions must disappear from the Flemish capital. 
  Flemish Liberal Democrats (VLD): For the VLD, the 
European elections are mainly a test case for the policy of the 
Belgian Government of Christian-Democrats and Socialists, who 
are also pulling the strings in Europe. According to the VLD, 
national governments should no longer hide behind Europe when 
enforcing unpopular measures, and Europe should be taken out of 
the hands of labor unions, lobbies, and pressure groups. 
  The Flemish liberals advocate an overt administration within 
a federal and democratic Europe. The party wants the citizens 
to become more actively involved in Europe. Citizens should be 
given the opportunity to have their say about the policy through 
referendums, and to elect the leader of a European government 
directly. The EP should get constitutional powers, and be on a 
par with the European Council of Ministers. Its members should 
give up jobs which threaten their impartiality. 
  The VLD wants our country to meet the Maastricht criteria, 
so 
that it can join the Monetary Union from the very outset, at the 
latest in 1999. In the economic field, Europe should safeguard 
fair competition. Economic support measures and subsidies 
should be done away with, even in the agricultural sector. The 
tax burden should be reduced. Social dumping and inequality 
between regions should be leveled out by providing direct 
support to the social security systems of member states which 
have underdeveloped regions. 
  The VLD warns against the danger of the European Union (EU) 
being reduced to a free trade area as a result of its expansion. 
The VLD also urges for a European foreign, security, and 
defense policy, and for a European approach to environmental 
problems, crime, and migration. Once a year, the EU should 
determine how many foreigners it will admit on economic grounds. 
  The People's Union (VU): The VU advocates a 
Europe in which regions and national communities can preserve 
their own identities. The member states' influence should be 
curtailed to achieve a transparent, democratic, and federal 
Europe. That is why the party favors a direct representation of 
Flanders and Wallonia in the Council of Ministers. For the VU, 
the Regional Committee is a prefiguration of a senate of regions 
and peoples, which should replace the present Council of 
Ministers and carry out the constitutional work along with the 
EP. 
  The completion of the unified market must not be at the 
expense of the environment. A European social policy is 
urgently required, and the gap between poor and rich regions 
should be narrowed. According to the VU, the white paper does 
not go far enough. Lower taxes on labor and the reduction of 
working hours are indispensable for more employment. 
Furthermore, the EU should conduct an active peace policy, and 
action should be taken to counteract the spread of French 
language versus Dutch in Brussels and the surrounding area, and 
against the pressure on the real estate market as a result of 
the presence of European institutions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Michael Theodoulou report: "Tehran Exploits Bosnia </F>
Conflict To Bolster Regime"] 
  [Text] Revelations that Iranian diplomats have forged 
documents which claim to show that Britain's policy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is anti-Muslim are further proof that the 
government in Tehran is using the conflict in former Yugoslavia 
to bolster support for itself. 
  The plight of Bosnia's Muslims has become the latest 
anti-Western rallying cry for Iran's leadership, which is trying 
to whip up revolutionary fervour to coincide with the fifth 
anniversary of the Ayatollah Khomeini's death on Saturday. 
Photographs depicting the suffering of Muslims in the besieged 
Bosnian town of Gorazde are prominent in the lobbies of several 
hotels in the capital, and the subject has dominated Friday 
prayers at Tehran University for months. 
  In spite of its economic crisis, Iran is sending arms to 
Islamic fundamentalists in the West Bank and Gaza, Algeria and 
Sudan, and last month donated 1 million pounds to Bosnian 
Muslims. Tehran radio began broadcasting propaganda in 
Serbo-Croat on short-wave transmissions to Bosnia. Iranian 
government officials and diplomats in Tehran believe President 
Rafsanjani would like to see better ties with the West, but is 
being forced to retreat by pressure from hardliners. Iran's 
foreign policy has hardened markedly in recent weeks. 
  Tehran attacked Saudi Arabia after Riyadh prevented Iranian 
pilgrims holding anti-Western demonstrations during the annual 
haj pilgrimage. And yesterday the Iranians arrested two Iraqis 
they claimed were high-ranking intelligence officers sent to 
organise sabotage. 
  Iranian leaders are using the row with Britain to prove 
their 
revolutionary credentials while at the same time presenting 
Tehran as the Islamic world's leading champion of dispossessed 
Muslims. Radical groups which have the upper hand are urging 
Iran to sever ties with Britain following accusations that a 
listening device was planted in the Iranian Embassy in London. 
  Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani tried to tackle the hard-liners 
last autumn by dissolving the 15 Khordad Foundation, a shadowy 
pseudocharitable organisation based in Qom which put a 1.3 
million [currency not specified] bounty on Salman Rushdie's 
head. However, the move was blocked by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 
Iran's spiritual leader, who went on Tehran Radio to insist that 
Muslims worldwide were duty-bound to murder Rushdie. 
  "The two men have had at least one screaming row over 
(Salman) Rushdie," an Iranian official said. "Rafsanjani would 
love to crush these autonomous religious circles that are 
getting in his way, but they are financially independent and 
constitutionally they are answerable to Khamenei. 
  The Rushdiefatwa remains a rallying cry for radicals hoping 
to reinvigorate waning revolutionary fervour, but it has impeded 
the President's attempts to improve relations with the West and 
win investment crucial to the faltering economic reforms on 
which he has staked his reputation. Iranian hard-liners have 
gained strength following the economic crisis which is blamed on 
Hojjat-oleslam Rafsanjani's programme. 
  The President surprised diplomats last month by taking a 
high 
profile in the row with Britain by alleging that M16 was bugging 
the Iranian Embassy in London. He incited the Iranian media, 
and several newspapers urged the government to sever ties with 
what one paper called "the ageing father of colonialism." 
Despite the unpopularity of Iran's Islamic leadership, its 
attempts to incite anti-British sentiment are guaranteed some 
success in a society ready to believe conspiracy theories 
against the old colonial master whose history of meddling in 
Iranian affairs is taught to children in all schools.

<F P=106> [Philip Stephens report: "Brown Gives Blair Clear Run at </F>
Party Leadership"] 
  [Text] Mr Tony Blair's bid for the Labour Party leadership 
looked unstoppable last night after his close friend and ally, 
Mr Gordon Brown, bowed out of the race to succeed Mr John Smith. 
  Mr Brown's decision means he will now give his full backing 
to Mr Blair and will in turn be guaranteed his current post of 
shadow chancellor. 
  It is understood in talks between the two -- the party's 
leading "modernisers" -- Mr Brown has been promised the pivotal 
role in shaping economic and social policy in any future Labour 
government led by Mr Blair. 
  Mr Blair, currently shadow home secretary, now has the 
overwhelming support of the shadow cabinet and of Labour MPs in 
the leadership race. A substantial majority of trades union 
leaders also support him. 
  That raises the possibility that the 41-year-old MP for 
Sedgefield could become the youngest party leader this century 
after only a token contest. One member of the shadow cabinet 
said last night that the party's choice was now "a formality." 
  Last night the head of one of Britain's biggest unions, Mr 
Bill Jordan, of the AEEU [Allied Electrical and Engineering 
Union] engineering and electrical union, called on possible 
leadership candidates to follow Mr Brown's example by not 
standing against Mr Blair. 
  Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting Labour leader, Mr John 
Prescott, 
shadow employment secretary and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and 
industry secretary, are all potential contenders for the 
leadership. Mr Cook was last night understood to be keeping his 
options open and Mrs Beckett has said she will not reveal her 
intentions until after the European elections on June 9. 
  But senior figures in the party last night appeared 
confident 
that both Mr Cook and Mrs Beckett would decide eventually not to 
run against Mr Blair. 
  That would leave Mr Prescott, the standard-bearer of the 
party's "traditionalist" wing with a difficult decision of 
whether to contest the leadership or whether to stand against 
Mrs Beckett for the post of deputy leader. 
  Left-wing Labour MPs believe a contest is vital to test Mr 
Blair's stance on the key economic and social decisions the 
party must take before the general election. 
  Mr Prescott has supported that view but must now assess the 
risk to his political career that a defeat would cause . 
  In a brief statement, Mr Brown said that he had taken his 
decision to clear up "the confusion" over whether he would fight 
Mr Blair for the leadership. He had only one consideration in 
mind "to ensure the election of a Labour government to improve 
and regenerate our country." 
  Close friends insisted that Mr Brown had won equal support 
from MPs, members of the shadow cabinet and union leaders for 
his own candidacy. But he recognised Mr Blair's stronger appeal 
to the electorate. Mr Blair accepted that under his leadership 
the "fairness," agenda developed by Mr Brown to link economic 
and social policies would be the basis for Labour policy for the 
next election.

<F P=106> [Philip Webster report: "Major Hints at Britain in the Slow </F>
Lane"] 
  [Text] John Major turned his vision of a Britain at the 
heart of Europe on its head last night when he admitted that the 
UK could be in the slow lane of a "multi-track" community. 
  The Prime Minister raised the prospect of Britain opting out 
of the next stages of political and economic integration just a 
day after France called for like-minded member states to forge 
ahead, leaving stragglers behind. 
  His speech at a European election rally in Ellesmere Port, 
Cheshire, was a clear attempt to reassure Eurosceptic 
Conservatives that Britain would never be forced to accept a 
single currency or further centralisation against its will. 
  He insisted that it was "old-fashioned commonsense" that 
member states should be free to do some things in their own way 
and at their own speed. But he had dearly moved a long way from 
his speech in March 1991 when he said: "We want to arrive at 
solutions which will enable us to move forward more united, not 
less." 
  Last night, amid clear signs that France and Germany are 
planning a joint strategy to keep up momentum for a more 
integrated union, Mr Major set out his new vision of a Europe 
where countries could move between the fast and slow lanes. 
  He said he had never believed that Europe must invariably 
act 
as one on every issue and advocated what he called "a sensible 
new approach, varying when it needs to, multi-track, 
multi-speed, multi-layered. It is a Conservative idea in line 
with the mood of people everywhere. We should be examining how 
this can work, not just fighting over the old centralised 
prescription. 
  Mr Major's remarks brought a furious attack from his 
opponents, with John Cunningham saying he had abandoned any 
pretence that Britain would be a first-rate nation in Europe. 
"The Prime Minister has let the cat out of the bag," the shadow 
Foreign Secretary said. "He has admitted that his Government 
would let Britain fall behind in Europe. He is apparently 
willing to offer voluntary relegation to the second division in 
Europe and he isn't even prepared to put up a fight. 
  "I believe that in any two-speed Europe, Britain must be up 
with those in the fast lane. Clearly, Mr Major does not." 
  Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said: 
"This is a negative, defeatist message of a nasty, divided 
party. This is not about a multi-track, multi-speed, 
multi-layered Europe, but a second-class Britain in a two-tier 
Europe. Britain will be condemned to a seat below the salt at 
the top table of Europe." 
  Senior Conservatives said last night that Mr Major was 
making 
plain his view that beyond the matters that had already been 
agreed by the EU [European Union], it did not make sense for 
every member state to march in the same direction at the same 
speed. On some issues, Britain would clearly be in the fast 
lane; on others, such as the single currency, it would reserve 
its position. 
  Mr Major had told his invited audience: "I do not happen to 
think that it threatens Europe if member states are free to do 
some things in their own way and at their own speed. It is 
simply good old-fashioned commonsense. 
  "If other countries want to slap more costs on their 
businesses, then they are welcome to -- if they want the Social 
Chapter, they can have it. But we are not having it here." 
  The experience of the past two years proved that Europe 
could 
not be taken too far, too fast. Britain was right not to be 
pushed into agreeing a single currency in place of the pound. 
"It may happen in the future -- or it may not. But in any 
event, we cannot make a sensible judgment on it now, and a 
future Parliament must be free to say yes or no when it has all 
the facts before it."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Edward </F>
Sturton in London from the "Midday" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sturton] What are your views on Major's remarks 
last night on a multispeed Europe? 
  [Hurd] We are at the heart of every discussion and there are 
core rules, the kind of rules for example which prevent the 
Germans from excluding British beef, the kind of rules which 
make the French admit British airlines to Orly, which make us do 
sometimes things that are in the agreed rules, and that's 
important, and there are other things which we do because we 
agree and it suits us to do them, things we call the two other 
pillars of Maastricht, foreign policy, home affairs policy, the 
efforts against the international criminal, we cooperate there 
as governments because we want to tackle the problem together, 
that's how Europe is developing. 
  [Sturton] But the last time you tried to take a stand, which 
as you put it, suits Britain and not the rest of Europe over the 
blocking mechanism in an enlarged community, you were forced 
into a humiliating climbdown. 
  [Hurd] We compromised there, and you will see when the time 
comes next year that the compromise works well from our point of 
view, but that was nothing to do with the national veto. 
  [Sturton] And I did not suggest it was. 
  [Hurd] No, no the national veto is the crucial part. 
  [Sturton] But can you give me one example when the sort of 
flexibility that you are talking about has actually been used 
successfully? 
  [Hurd] Of course, a whole number of things which when we 
started talking about them we were a lone voice, subsidiarity, 
minimum interference, enlargement of the community, the single 
market, all these were ideas which we started talking about 
then, were not well received and now the orthodoxy is actually 
happening, that is progress being made, but defense, frontiers, 
the ERM, these are all examples were we already have a 
multispeed Europe. 
  [Sturton] Can I ask you finally, foreign secretary, were the 
sort of contortions you all have to go through, for domestic 
reasons during an election making your life difficult in the 
Council of Europe? 
  [Hurd] I really cannot accept that, the ideas which the 
prime 
minister put forward from Maastricht on the idea I put forward 
for the example at our Scottish party conference a few weeks ago 
-- the ideas we are putting forward in this election campaign, 
this is a very clear and coherent idea of the way we think 
Europe should go in the interests of Britain and other peoples 
in Europe, it is different from the old fashioned idea with 
which you and others occasionally are besotted, that the only 
good European is one who believes in moving power inexorably to 
Brussels, that is not our Conservative view, we have a positive 
view about Europe, and that's the view we are consistently 
putting across.

<F P=106> [Report by David Sharrock and Lawrence Donegan: "IRA </F>
Intelligence War Suffers Setback"] 
  [Text] The greatest blow to the intelligence war against 
the IRA dealt by last night's helicoptcr crash will be felt by 
the Royal Ulster Constabulary [RUC], which takes the leading 
role in antiterrorism. 
  The head of its Special Branch was feared to be among the 
dead last night. His role, at the very top of the intelligence 
pyramid, is seen as crucial in the fight against the IRA. 
  Special Branch's most important task is in the gathering and 
collating of information about IRA volunteers. 
  Among the dead were also figures from the Northern Ireland 
Office's shadowy terrorist finance unit, a department so 
secretive that many of its operatives are not even familiar to 
long-standing civil servants. 
  Members of the department which is senior in rank to the 
RUC's C13 antiracketeering unit, are drawn from other government 
departments because of their expertise in taxation accountancy 
banking, VAT [value-added tax] and financial law. 
  The department played a key role in last month's Operation 
Madronna, the biggest antiterrorist finance operation ever 
carried out, supported by police forces in England, Northern 
Ireland and the Irish Republic. 
  Special Branch's responsibiIities include recruiting of 
agents within the paramilitary organisations and the running of 
these prized figures. Highly placed security figures on both 
side of the border agree that a well-placed mole is the most 
dangerous threat to the paramilitaries. 
  Special Branch is also in command of organising other means 
of acquiring information, such as eavesdropping and photographic 
record, all of which is handled within the RUC's "E" department. 
  The department would also co-ordinate liaison with other 
intelligence services, including M15, Interpol, Scotland yard's 
antiterrorist squad, and the FBI and CIA in the United States. 
  Much of the Special Branch's energy in Northern Ireland is 
expended infiltrating and recruiting from loyalist and 
republican paramilitary groups. It has undoubtedly made inroads 
into both factions, although its methods have frequently been 
criticised. 
  Last September the family of IRA man Joseph Mulhern, who was 
shot dead by his paramilitary colleagues, accused branch 
officers of pressurising his son into working for the security 
service. 
  Frank Mulhern, the IRA man's father, claimed his son was 
taken to the RUC interrogation centre at Casllreagh and told 
that if he did not provide information, police would use 
contacts with loyalists to have members of his family shot. 
  Raymond Gilmour, a former RUC supergrass whose evidence was 
used in attempts to jail over 30 terrorist suspects claimed a 
Special Branch officer tried to recruit him when he was 
teenager. After he was arrested for his part in a robbery in 
the late 1970's, Gilmour was approached by the same officer. He 
eventually agreed to infiltrate the Irish National Liberation 
Army. 
  "Others may have seen me as an informer, but my handler 
called me an agent and I saw myself as an undercover policeman. 
My handler told me: The only thing I can't give you is a 
uniform," he later said. 
  In recent years, Special Branch officers in the province 
have 
been involved in a power struggle with their MI5 counterparts 
over who controls the antiterrorist operations in Northern 
Ireland. 
  The decision taken over a year ago, by the then Home 
Secretary Kenneth Clarke, to give primacy over such activities 
to the MI5 provoked a great deal of resentment within the branch. 
  Last night one security source said that the crash was the 
most serious blow since the murder of two highranking RUC 
officers, who were shot dead in the Ardoyne district of North 
Belfast in 1971. Their murders are said to have contributed 
significantly to the failure of the internment raids which were 
supposed to have removed the senior players in Northern 
Ireland's paramilitary organisations.

<F P=106> [Colin Narbrough report: "Money Supply Growth Sparks </F>
Inflation Fears"] 
  [Text] Sharp acceleration in the money supply in May, 
despite the 8 billion pound increase in taxes in April, ruled 
out hopes of further interest rate cuts and raised the spectre 
of monetary tightening ahead to check inflation. 
  Year-on-year growth in MO, the officially targeted narrow 
money measure, relating mainly to banknotes and coins, rose to 
7.1 per cent. This indicates that the authorities will have to 
watch for signs of inflationary pressures building up. The 
Government's target for MO is 0 to 4 per cent. 
  Fears about inflation and interest rates sent shudders 
through Europe's financial markets; the FT-SE 100 index fell 41 
points at one stage, before the market recovered its nerve. The 
index ended 4.1 points up, at 2,970.5. Bonds fell sharply, the 
long gilt shedding 1.5 points. 
  Anxieties will be reinforced by the results of the latest 
survey from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
(CIPS). They show that raw materials shortages and capacity 
constraints appear to be driving up prices in manufacturing. 
  The institutes purchasing managers index, which measures 
output, new orders, delivery times, stocks and jobs, rose to 
59.2 per cent in May, its highest since the series began in June 
1991. Demand was found to be growing so fast in some areas that 
firms were having difficulty finding supplies. 
  The survey underlines last week's CBI [Confederation of 
British Industry] industry report, which indicated that economic 
growth had withstood the tax shock. But the CIPS prices index 
rose for the sixth successive month, jumping to 57.8 per cent in 
May, from 54.3 per cent in April. 
  The strength of new orders, at record levels in May, and of 
production, encouraged firms to take on more workers for the 
fourth consecutive month. The survey and other pointers are 
likely to prompt the Treasury to upgrade its growth forecast for 
the overall economy this year from the 2.5 per cent predicted in 
November. 
  The Bank of England said year-on-year growth in MO, for 
which 
the Treasury has set an annual growth monitoring range of 0 to 4 
per cent, rose to 7.1 per cent in May, after a 6.2 per cent gain 
in April. Annualised MO growth over the past six months was 9.2 
per cent. 
  The Treasury sought to dismiss the above-target growth in 
MO, 
arguing that interest rates at their lowest for two decades have 
persuaded consumers to hold more cash. But the Bank, more 
concerned about inflation, gave a warning in its recent 
inflation report that the implications would be "more 
disturbing" if the money supply continued to rise. 
  The Bank sees MO as a reliable advance indicator of 
inflation. The measure is linked by economists to movements in 
retail sales, which showed annual growth of 4.4 per cent in 
April. Though some economists believe the impact of tax 
increases on consumers has yet to be felt, galloping MO suggests 
that the monetary reins might need a tweak by the end of the 
year. 
  Year-on-year growth in May was distorted by very low growth 
recorded in May last year. But John Marsland, an economist at 
UBS, said the rate of increase was still very strong and 
signalled a bout of inflation next year. 
  The Government has highlighted its success in achieving 
economic growth with low inflation, and City economists believe 
there is no immediate need to raise base rate from its present 
5.24 per cent. Some fear, however, that by the final quarter of 
next year, base rates will have almost doubled to contain 
inflation. 
  Mortgage lending by the major British banks totalled 1.43 
billion in April, a fall of 11 per cent from March and 20 per 
cent lower than in April last year, the British Bankers' 
Association (BBA) said. Net lending, after seasonal adjustment, 
showed a further deceleration. Mortgage approvals were also 
lower in April, in both value and volume. 
  Lord Inchyra, the BBA's director-general, said it was too 
soon to attribute the drop in lending to tax increases or 
changes in mortgage tax relief. He said two explanations could 
be the shorter month and a rush in March to beat the 
introduction of higher rates on fixed-rate mortgages.

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg in early May is weapons-grade material. As 
DPA learned from a well-informed source on Friday [27 May], the 
material, which was not recognized by the authorities for weeks, 
is 56 grams of plutonium-239 in powder form. According to the 
information, the highly poisonous material was found during the 
search of an apartment in Tengen near Konstanz in the course of 
investigations involving counterfeiting. [passage omitted] 
  So far, no information has been provided about the origin of 
the material. The Environment Ministry announced on Thursday 
that the material probably came from East Europe. The Land 
Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) in Stuttgart, which is 
responsible for the investigations, has announced that it will 
issue a statement on Friday. The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's 
Office has not yet commented. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized during 
the search of an apartment in Baden-Wuerttemberg in May is 
suitable for the construction of a nuclear bomb. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Land Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) and the 
Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office have meanwhile announced 
that the highly dangerous material was found during the search 
of an apartment on 10 May in the course of investigating a case 
of counterfeiting money. The plutonium was stored in a 
cylindrical lead container that weighs 4.5 kg, is 11 cm tall, 
and was closed with a steel band. 
  According to the investigating authorities, the owner of the 
apartment that was searched, a 52-year-old German businessman is 
in detention pending trial on suspicion of dealing in 
counterfeit money. During questioning, he claimed that the 
powder is a substance for refining metal. The LKA in Stuttgart 
has stated that the investigations of the counterfeiting affair 
are conducted by the Bavarian LKA. The Baden-Wuerttemberg 
authorities had only provided legal aid. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- The plutonium discovered in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg in May and which is suitable for the 
construction of a nuclear bomb, seems to have come from Moscow, 
according to German intelligence services. As DPA learned on 
Friday [3 June] from well-informed sources, the plutonium 
arrived in Germany by "a roundabout route." From the Russian 
capital it was first brought to Hungary and Switzerland. So 
far, no further details are known. 
  The highly radioactive heavy metal was discovered on 10 May 
during the search of the apartment of a businessman in Tengen 
near Konstanz in the course of investigating a case of money 
laundering. The businessman is in detention pending trial. 
Experts say that this is the first case of smuggling 
weapons-grade plutonium that has been uncovered in Germany.

<F P=106> [DPA embargoes this item until further notice] </F>
  [Text] Rostock (DPA) -- At the beginning of the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] Federal Congress in Rostock on Friday [3 
June], FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel confirmed, as expected, the 
FDP's intention to continue the coalition with the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] after the 
Bundestag elections on 16 October. In his opening speech 
Kinkel, on behalf of the Presidium and the Federal Executive 
Committee, presented a corresponding resolution to the congress 
to vote on it. 
  The resolution says: "On the basis of its liberal program, 
the FDP wants to continue the successful coalition with the 
CDU/CSU in the next legislative period." Kinkel stressed that 
this signal must "emanate" from the congress "to the outside." 
  It is considered certain that the about 660 delegates will 
approve the coalition statement by a great majority. 
  Kinkel harshly attacked the Social Democratic Party [SPD] 
and 
the Greens. The SPD wants to come to power together with the 
Greens. This would mean an SPD government program that is 
hostile to the economy, a hindrance for economic recovery, and a 
killer of performance, embellished with the demands of the 
Greens, up to the dissolution of the Bundeswehr and getting out 
of NATO. "I can only say: red-green -- good night, Germany." 
  According to Kinkel, a grand coalition would not be better, 
either, but would just be a policy of following the path of 
least resistance and conducted at the smallest common 
denominator. Rather, it has been the coalitions with the FDP 
that have brought progress in Germany, Kinkel said. A strong 
FDP is the guarantee against red-green and against a grand 
coalition. Even in this difficult time there is no need to hide 
the successful record of the current coalition in Bonn. "We 
want to continue our successful work after 16 October." There 
are still important tasks to do, which can best be solved 
together, Kinkel said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The government wants to expand joint 
research with Russia under the slogan "Help for Self-Help." 
Bernd Neumann (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary 
secretary of state in the Research Ministry, told the press in 
Bonn on Friday [27 May] that agreements on joint research in 
three specialized fields -- biological science, water and 
environmental research, and information technology -- should be 
reached during his government talks due to begin in Moscow on 
Monday. This should be followed by a further agreement on 
increased cooperation on maritime and polar research. 
  During his four-day stay, which includes a visit to St. 
Petersburg, Neumann intends to acquaint himself with the current 
situation in Russian research, which is suffering from, among 
other things, a shortage of money and personnel. Nevertheless, 
Russian scientists continue to be desirable partners, especially 
in the fields of space travel, maritime and polar research, and 
laser technology, he said. A major project in space cooperation 
is the development of the "Express" space capsule, being 
undertaken jointly with Japan. 
  In the sphere of nuclear reactor safety, Neumann mentioned 
the expediency of using German technology and experience in 
examining deficiencies in reactors. Russian experts should be 
given an opportunity to improve the safety of their nuclear 
power stations, which does not meet Western standards. 
  Bonn is spending some 37.5 million German marks [DM] until 
the end of 1994 on a scientific support program that started in 
1992. In addition, Russian scientists are involved in over 100 
specialized projects on which the Research Ministry is spending 
DM240 million. The Western-sponsored projects include the 
International Science and Technology Center in Moscow, which can 
largely be attributed to an idea of former Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.

  [Text] Hanoi (DPA) -- The Vietnamese Government is ready 
to negotiate with Bonn about the return of the roughly 40,000 
Vietnamese who live in Germany illegally. Vietnamese Government 
members told this to Bonn's Development Minister Carl-Dieter 
Spranger (Christian Social Union) in Hanoi on Friday [27 May]. 
The Federal Government has long been urging the conclusion of 
such an agreement with Vietnam, which has so far blocked 
deportations in Bonn's view -- for instance by refusing to issue 
Vietnamese immigration papers. 
  The Vietnamese in question are both asylum-seekers as well 
as 
former guest workers of the GDR whose residence permits expire 
if they cannot prove they have regular work in the FRG. The 
number of asylum-seekers has risen to about 11,000 (1993) over 
the past three years. Fewer than 1 percent are recognized as 
having a right to asylum. 
  Speaking to journalists in Hanoi, Do Quoc Sam, head of the 
State Planning Commission, emphatically rejected reports that 
parastatal institutions are involved in smuggling services for 
entering Germany. 
  So far, the Vietnamese Government has argued that it cannot 
accept all emigrated or escaped fellow-citizens at once. They 
will be permitted to return if they come voluntarily and the 
Federal Government provides financial support for their 
reintegration. 
  The FRG Development Ministry is promoting the integration of 
returnees from the former GDR with an existence-founding 
program, advanced training, and advice. A total of 18 million 
German marks has been promised for this purpose.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Military cooperation between the 
Bundeswehr and the Polish Army will be increased further. 
Inspector General Klaus Naumann and General Tadeusz Wilecki, 
general chief of staff of the Polish armed forces, held talks in 
the Defense Ministry in Bonn on 30 May and discussed the 
deepening of cooperation, armed forces planning for the coming 
years, and work in the NATO Cooperation Council. Earlier, 
Naumann had received the Polish general with military honors. 
Wilecki has come to the Federal Republic for a three-day visit 
of the Bundeswehr. 
  Naumann also informed his Polish guest on the Bundeswehr's 
new tasks. During his visit, Wilecki will acquaint himself with 
units in Bavaria on the Bundeswehr's air defense organization 
and the training of Army soldiers. Poland, which has joined 
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, is seeking full 
integration into the European Union (EU), the Western European 
Union (WEU), and the North Atlantic Alliance. In September, the 
FRG Navy, along with Polish and Danish Naval forces, will hold 
joint mine defense exercises off the Mecklenburg coast. The 
Polish Army is adjusting to NATO standards in its command and 
armed forces structures.

<F P=106> [By PAP correspondent Wlodzimierz Korzycki] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 30 May, PAP -- "We will be intensifying 
cooperation with the Federal Republic. Both sides are striving 
toward this," General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army 
General Staff has told a PAP correspondent after talks at the 
Bonn Defense Ministry. On day one of a three-day visit, Gen. 
Wilecki had talks with his host, Gen. Klaus Naumann, inspector 
general of the Bundeswehr, about joint undertakings by the two 
Armies and about Partnership for Peace. 
  They agreed on closer contacts between the staffs of the 
Polish Army and the Bundeswehr; between military districts, our 
Pomeranian and Silesian, and their counterparts across the Odra; 
and between the Navies. 
  Cross-border cooperation will be continued. According to the 
generals, some units could establish twin partnerships and, 
bewteen them, exchange training experiences. An agreement will 
be signed in the near future to provide formal permission to 
commanding personnel and servicemen's communities. This would 
apply to several land and Naval units, especially those 
stationed close to one another in the border zone. Twin 
partnerships mean not only mutual observation of exercises, but 
also contacts between families. 
  Asked about the role of Germany in our defense policy, Gen. 
Wilecki replied that it was in Poland's interests to maintain 
good contacts with all of our neighbors, including the Federal 
Republic. "Until now we have had better relations with our other 
neighbors; now we are levelling these." 
  The general conceded that in our public's consciousness 
there 
undoubtedly were obstacles against rapprochement with Germany. 
But this process has to be started. If we are seriously 
thinking about Partnership for Peace and integration with NATO, 
Germany is our first natural neighbor along the road to 
Brussels. "It plays one of the main parts in these structures 
and I cannot imagine us not maintaining good contacts with them. 
The leadership of the Bundeswehr views this cooperation 
favorably," noted the chief of the Polish Army General Staff. 
  Gen. Wilecki will spend the next two days in Bavaria where 
he 
will be familiarized with the air defense system and the 
training of highland infantry and engineering and ordnance 
troops.

  [Text] Bonn, 1 June (MTI) -- Although the prospect of 
Hungarian-German military-industry cooperation will sooner or 
later be raised, concrete plans have not yet taken shape, 
Hungarian Deputy State Secretary of Defense Sandor Turjan told 
reporters in Bonn today. 
  Turjan mentioned electronics as a possible field of 
cooperation, which would facilitate communication and the 
adjustment of Hungarian military technology to NATO standards. 
  The deputy state secretary signed a new complementary 
agreement on a list of German military equipment to be delivered 
to Hungary by late September from the arsenal of the former East 
German Army. 
  This year Germany will deliver 400 wagonloads of components, 
worth 150 million German marks, to Hungary -- free of charge. 
Germany handed over the same amount to Hungary last year. 
  In February of this year, Budapest and Bonn signed an 
agreement on the delivery of German parts for Hungarian combat 
helicopters.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday [30 May] about 200 
demonstrators protested with whistles, paint bags, and noisy 
slogans such as "Nazis out" against a rally by the rightist 
"League of Free Citizens" for the European election in Hamburg. 
When demonstrators tried to break through the cordon around the 
speaker's rostrum, the police used clubs. Several demonstrators 
were arrested. A few policemen and demonstrators were slightly 
injured. 
  Even though Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of 
Austria, who was the speaker at the rally, and "League of Free 
Citizens" Chairman Manfred Brunner could barely be heard because 
of the ear-splitting noise, the rally was not interrupted. 
Haider and Brunner thanked the Hamburg police for "protecting 
us against the leftist mob." The demonstrators repeatedly 
chanted "German policemen protect fascists" or "Everyone wants 
the same thing -- throw Haider into the Elbe River." 
  The "League of Free Citizens" considers itself to be 
conservative-liberal. It primarily opposes the Maastricht 
Treaty, which would turn Germany into a European province, "but 
we want a Europe of the fatherlands, of nations."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Right-wing extremist acts of violence 
have decreased. The Cologne-based Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution said on 31 May that from 1 
January to 19 May this year, 563 acts of violence with proved or 
assumed extreme right-wing motivation were noted. Compared with 
the last 20 weeks of 1993 (594), the number of such acts of 
violence thus decreased by approximately 5 percent. 
  Of the 563 violent acts, 331 (as against 408 in the period 
of 
comparison in 1993) were motivated by xenophobia. This means a 
decrease by approximately 19 percent. The share of arson and 
explosive attacks is 10 percent. In the period of comparison in 
1993, it was approximately 12 percent. In 1994, six homicidal 
attempts by right-wing extremists were noted. In the last 20 
weeks of 1993, the number was the same.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A serious leadership crisis seems to 
be on the horizon in the right-wing extremist Republikaner 
party. On Tuesday [31 May] Udo Boesch, the Republikaner's 
federal organization manager, became the second leading member 
to leave the party within a brief period. In his letter of 
resignation, which has been obtained by DPA, Boesch justified 
his break with the Republikaner by pointing out that Chairman 
Franz Schoenhuber's public distancing from "neo-Nazi ideas" 
proves to be just empty words in internal party life. 
  Following the resignation of Federal Secretary Martina 
Rosenberger, Boesch is the second high-ranking Republikaner 
functionary who publicly refuses to follow Schoenhuber. In his 
letter of resignation Boesch adds that Schoenhuber is 
participating "in a masterly way in intrigues that are solely 
intended to consolidate his own power" instead of showing the 
will to shape policy. Furthermore, the Republikaner have not 
taken the step toward a democratic program party, the retired 
lieutenant colonel wrote to Schoenhuber. After about two years 
as organization manager, security adviser, and member of the 
federal election campaign leadership, he had realized that 
Schoenhuber uses the party only as a "stage for his very own 
presentation and thus satisfies an almost pathological obsession 
with the media." 
  On Tuesday [31 May] Boesch told the ZDF [Second German TV 
Channel] magazine program "Frontal": "I have come to the end of 
my road -- I do not want to be responsible any further." In the 
television cast Boesch also accuses the party leadership of not 
having prevented anti-Semitic agitation.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to the Federal Office for 
the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the Republikaner are 
obviously developing toward a right-wing extremist party, which 
is hostile to the constitution. BfV spokesman Hans-Gerd Lange 
told DPA on Tuesday [31 May] upon inquiry that the resignation 
of Udo Boesch, federal organization manager and security adviser 
of the Republikaner, and of federal secretary Martina 
Rosenberger confirm the process of erosion, which has been under 
way in this party for some time now. "The trend of the 
development toward a right-wing extremist party is shown in many 
findings, which can be used in court and which the BfV has 
gathered in more than one year of observing the Republikaner," 
Lange stated. 
  According to Lange, an increasing number of Republikaner 
members, such as Boesch and Rosenberger, realize that their 
"idealistic ideas fail because of the authoritarian claims on 
leadership by federal chairman Franz Schoenhuber and because of 
a lack of inner-party democracy or are overlaid by right-wing 
extremist trends that have emerged." The intensive observation 
of the party has enabled the BfV "to gain profound insights on 
the structure of the party, on the structure of its 
organization, on the current state of the Federal Executive 
Committee and the land associations, as well as on the financial 
situation of the Reublikaner." According to the findings, 
individual land associations are "in a desolate organizational 
and financial situation." According to documents obtained by 
the BfV, individual land executive committees think that orderly 
party work and a successful election campaign are impossible. 
  According to Lange, the Republikaner have been "permeated by 
right-wing extremists at all levels." The BfV has obtained a 
statement in lieu of oath that Schoenhuber was sufficiently 
informed as early as in 1993 (November/December) by Uwe Goller, 
acting land chairman of North Rhine-Westphalia, about the 
party's involvement in the arson attack on the asylum-seekers' 
hostel in Bergheim-Zieverich. In contrast, in a press 
statement, which was published on 27 April 1994, Schoenhuber 
claimed that he learned about the events in Zieverich only on 22 
April 1994. According to Lange, the BfV has also learned of a 
flier, which was distributed in the area of Dresden at the end 
of 1992 and in which President Richard von Weizsaecker was 
slandered as a participant in international arms deals and as 
someone who is to be partly blamed for the death of tens of 
thousands of Vietnamese and Laotians. 
  As Lange explained further, during its observations the BfV 
also found out that the Republikaner have conducted intensive 
recruiting of members in particular in the security authorities. 
In the five new laender "it was attempted to include members of 
the former GDR security organs in party work," Lange explained. 
In addition to former officers of the National People's Army 
(NVA) and SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] members, the 
acceptance of former employees of the Ministry of State Security 
(MfS) was also considered possible.

  [Excerpt] Bonn/Mulhouse (DPA) -- The Federal Government is 
pressing for an early achievement of the stability criteria for 
European monetary union. However, Bonn Government spokesman 
Dieter Vogel said on Monday [30 May] that there has not been a 
formal agreement with the other partner countries to give up the 
earliest possible date possible under the Maastricht Treaty, 
1997, and to start monetary union not before 1999. At the 
Franco-German Financial and Economic Council in Mulhouse 
(Alsace), Finance Minister Theo Waigel said that Germany would 
fulfill the Maastricht criterion regarding the deficit quota by 
1996 at the latest. In the medium term, the conditions for the 
debt level would be achieved, too. 
  According to Vogel, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who also 
attended the Franco-German summit in Mulhouse, left no doubt 
that stability in European Union countries must have precedence 
over the timetable. In financial circles in Bonn, it has been 
said that under the Maastricht Treaty it has actually been clear 
that the majority of partner countries could not fulfill all 
criteria for debt level, deficits, and interests before the 
second possible deadline in 1999. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- At the annual meeting of the German 
Industry Federation (BDI) in Bonn on 31 May, Federal Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt warned about the transfer of more and 
more jobs to low-wage countries. He said that this could 
jeopardize Germany as a production center. In the service 
sector, too, jobs could be irrevocably lost as a result. 
Economics policymakers and trade unions should counteract this 
by improving production conditions in Germany. 
  At the BDI congress Rudolf Scharping, chancellor candidate 
of 
the Social Democratic Party [SPD], called for modernization of 
the national economy. "We are a long way away from a true 
recovery," Scharping said. The increasing export demand should 
not lead to the "fatal impression" that "we have done our job, 
and now things can continue as before." 
  BDI President Tyll Necker said that increasing international 
competition for the best production and financial center 
required basic structural change in industry and society. There 
were "no easy and pleasant formulas" in this respect. He 
appealed to all citizens to take part in the European 
Parliamentary elections. In this way, a free and peaceful 
Europe would be strengthened.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Francois Mitterrand by Josette </F>
Alia, Bernardo Valli, Julian Nundy, Javier Valenzuela, Jean 
Daniel, and Rudolph Chimelli at the Elysee; date not given: 
"Our Turn of the Century"] 
  [Text] Five years ago, at the request of a group of 
newspapers -- THE INDEPENDENT, EL PAIS, LA REPUBBLICA, 
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, and LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR -- the president 
of the Republic assessed the state of the world. Since then, 
although the Soviet threat has vanished with the fall of the 
Berlin Wall, nationalism is being reawakened, Yugoslavia is 
being torn apart, unemployment is growing worse everywhere, and 
Europe is taking a long time to be built. Should we see 
everything in black at the end of the second millenium? 
Francois Mitterrand now tells the same newspapers where he 
thinks the dangers lie and what can still be achieved. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Our last interview, Sir, dates back 
to July 1989, in other words before the collapse of the Berlin 
Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and German unificiation. 
Nobody at that time had foreseen, foresaw, or, it seems, could 
foresee what was going to happen. Should this degree of 
unpredictability in history fill with humility not only 
observers and strategists, but also heads of state? How real is 
the power of a president of the Republic when a presumed control 
of events escapes him to this degree? 
  [Mitterrand] Without claiming to see into the future, I had 
considered the hypothesis of the Soviet Union's disappearance, 
from which everything resulted, and especially German 
unification. At my election in 1981, I told my aides, 
especially Pierre Beregovoy, who was then secretary general of 
the presidency: "Start with the premise that the Soviet Union 
will have broken up before the end of the century." I was off 
by 10 years. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] On what was your prediction based? 
  [Mitterrand] All the signs seemed to show it in my view: the 
weakening of the central government; the chaos; the internal 
economic crisis, whose effects are still being felt because most 
of the countries of the former USSR and Russia itself have not 
yet picked up again. The deterioration was visible before 
Brezhnev's death. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In July 1989, you probably 
envisioned 
the possibility of German reunification, but with some 
hesitation, or even reservations, and in any event very little 
enthusiasm. 
  [Mitterrand] I see no sign of those reservations in the 
interview I granted to you at the time. We discussed 
reunification. That was four months before the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall. And I observed that this reunification was 
legitimate and that it had to be carried out democratically and 
peacefully, in other words the German people would have to give 
their verdict in free elections and those powers having special 
rights in Germany would have to agree. That has been done and 
within a reasonable period of time. On the other hand, I always 
stressed that the eastern border should first be recognized by 
the German leadership. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] However, were you not taken by 
surprise, like everybody, by the emergence, in this new Europe, 
of the old specter of nationalism which are reminiscent of the 
19th century? The euphoria which followed the liberation from 
Bolshevik oppression was brief, and you seemed to be anxious to 
warn of the dangers, even running counter to the current of 
history. 
  [Mitterrand] I do not see what you mean here either. You 
must remember that in the course of the century, Europe has seen 
the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, two 
German empires, two Russian empires, and, outside Europe, of the 
colonial empires. That is a lot. Wherever these empires have 
disappeared, various national movements, hitherto stifled, have 
emerged, even going so far as to take on the shape of ethnic 
groups. I remember stating at the end of 1989 that it was much 
better because it was good for peoples to be free, but that 
problems of a different nature were going to increase. It was 
rather a short-sighted view to think that freedom itself would 
solve everything! 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] You reached agreement with 
Chancellor 
Kohl that German unification should be accompanied by a speeding 
up of European unification. 
  [Mitterrand] Yes. Helmut Kohl constantly stated: "I only 
see German unification in symbiosis with European unity and 
progressing at the same pace." I did not think any differently. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] This unity, of which the Maastricht 
Treaty was an important stage, had been drawn up on the basis of 
situations preceding 1989. Did you foresee the scale and 
effects of expansion? 
  [Mitterrand] Nobody predicted that it would be so quick. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] If the new candidates open up the 
discussion of membershi qualifications, is Europe not likely to 
lose its substance? 
  [Mitterrand] The risk exists. With regard to the four new 
arrivals, the conditions put forward are not destructive. Of 
course, concessions have been made. But the basic treaty, the 
Maastricht Treaty, has not been distorted. After all, Britain 
was granted a long probationary period. The same was done for 
Spain. The essential thing in these expansions is not to alter 
the structures of the European Union [EU], not to empty them of 
their content. This is a crucial problem. France has a duty to 
be alert to this. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] The new arrivals, Finland, Austria, 
Sweden, and Norway, view Europe as a free trade area rather than 
a political union. 
  [Mitterrand] Of course. But Europe itself is for free trade, 
and I regret that it is to an excessive extent. This will 
change because people are beginning to realize that liberalism 
harms social systems and aggravates inequalities. Look at what 
is happening in Lithuania, Poland, and Hungary. These countries 
are not returning to Communism, but they are abandoning the 
liberal parties and voting for the former Communists who have 
become Socialists. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] The feeling which is growing in 
public opinion is that the Maastricht Treaty is a damp 
firecracker. 
  [Mitterrand] You are exaggerating. This treaty is being very 
unfairly blamed for all problems, and all the disappointments 
resulting from the crisis. However, the crisis is not coming 
from Europe. If a referendum had to be held again next month on 
the same subject, I would hold it again, and if all the 
supporters of the EU were mobilized, explained their views, and 
fought, although we have not heard much from them for some time, 
we would win. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] That is a dangerous gamble. 
  [Mitterrand] It was already dangerous back in September 
1992. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Bonn's desire to expand Europe to 
East Europe in order to be surrounded by friendly countries is 
seen by some as the expression of a new German hegemony. 
  [Mitterrand] It is possible to put forward any hypotheses 
you 
wish. But the expansion of the EU argues more in favor of the 
attraction it exerts. We are not complaining about that. 
Germany is in fact playing a major role in it. So is France, 
and other countries too. I think that in the future new 
expansions will require a really firm concept. Nothing should 
be accepted which would weaken the Union's achievements. In 
this respect, Germany and France would stand to gain from a 
better coordination of their actions. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do you see signs that Germany might 
become less European following the possible departure of 
Chancellor Kohl? 
  [Mitterrand] During a journey between Stuttgart and Mainz on 
his special train, Willy Brandt, who was then chancellor, told 
me: "I am likely to be the last European chancellor; there was 
first a chancellor for the West, namely Adenauer. I tried to 
ensure that there was a Germany and a Europe turned toward the 
East. It is likely that my successor or my successors will want 
to make a Europe for Germany." This forecast did not prove to 
be accurate, because Schmidt and Kohl have been very committed 
Europeans. We know that history is being built each day. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Did Mrs. Thatcher suggest to you an 
alliance against Germany, as she wrote in her Memoirs? 
  [Mitterrand] Talking of "alliance" is an exaggeration. But, 
at one time, when she was very hostile to Germany's unification, 
she thought that France and Britain should prevent it. I 
replied that although I wanted the Federal Republic to give 
clear pledges on the guarantee of borders and on the recognized 
principles of European stability, I would not repudiate 
Franco-German friendship, without which there could be no 
European unity. France and Germany have achieved a great deal 
together, whereas with Mrs. Thatcher's Britain we went no 
further than planned, except for the Channel tunnel, of course. 
Moreover, the accord with Germany did not rule out an accord 
with Britain, which is equally desirable. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In Europe today, there is reason to 
fear new extremes. For instance, in Italy we are seeing the 
emergence of political methods which are based on marketing: 
The chairman of a big communications company uses his private 
means and becomes prime minister. 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, it is an approach to democracy to which we 
were not accustomed and which strikes me as formidable. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] And which nonetheless strikes you 
as democratic? 
  [Mitterrand] The Italian people have given their verdict in 
democratic conditions. However, the means of informing the 
citizens must be equal and fair for all. That is where the 
problems may arise. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Is this true of Italy, in your view? 
  [Mitterrand] What I know is that, when you have the largest 
means of information, you have the opportunity to impress the 
public, at least temporarily, and hence to win in dubious 
conditions. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Could the Italian example 
contaminate 
other European countries? 
  [Mitterrand] I would avoid the word "contaminate." But it is 
a model which others will try to imitate. There is a risk of 
democracy being seriously debased. The time has come to say 
"Take care, danger!" 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In Italy there is also an attempt to 
make ideologies, which were condemned after World War II and 
which are reappearing, an ordinary part of life. 
  [Mitterrand] Is this how the question is presented? There 
are certainly forces in Europe which would like to rehabilitate 
what I found most reprehensible in my youth: fascism, Nazism, 
Francoism, and so forth. These are the characteristics of 
extremist groups. But I would be surprised if the parties called 
upon to govern did so without considerably altering their 
ideological apparatus. Although the Italians gave many votes to 
the neofascist party, represented in Mr. Berlusconi's 
government, that party is a long way from having a majority. Of 
course, if it were to dominate Italian politics one day, 
everything would have to be reviewed. Let us trust the Italians. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] What do you think of the criticism 
that Europe is paralyzed with regard to a common foreign policy? 
  [Mitterrand] A common foreign policy dates from the 
Maastricht summit and its resulting treaty which was only 
ratified a few months ago. To build Europe requires stamina, it 
is a long-distance race, not a sprint. Having said that, the 
war in the former Yugoslavia and other events are factors which 
speed things up. The criticism of the EU is based on distorted 
documents. It is now that we will find out whether our 
Maastricht ambition can be realized. However, you have to 
consider the fact that to achieve this, we have to overcome 
several centuries of confrontations and struggles for influence, 
which do not disappear overnight. Having said that, the 
European idea will be the great idea of the future, or it will 
be lost. I have made my choice. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Is it possible to compare the 
situation which the war in Spain created in Europe with the 
situation which the former Yugoslavia is now creating? 
  [Mitterrand] No. In the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Nazism 
and fascism saw a test ground for their own armaments. This is 
not the case now in Bosnia. It is Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia 
which are at stake, and not powers outside the Balkans. 
Although this situation is tragic, the comparison is not 
justified. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Yes, but Bosnia is testing the 
credibility of the international bodies, the presumed guardians 
of the new world order, be it the United Nations or NATO. 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, sorely testing. But denying the role and 
usefulness of the United Nations which is organizing the 
negotiations, which is sending in intervention forces, which is 
preventing the spread of the conflict, is also aggravating the 
war, behind an apparently pacifist front. Sarajevo and Gorazde 
can breathe, thanks to whom? 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] But after what tragedies! 
  [Mitterrand] Bosnia is suffering a great misfortune, but the 
safe areas have finally been respected and must continue to be 
respected. In Gorazde, time was wasted, and thus credibility 
was lost. I deplore that fact. All in all, UN policy has been 
asserted. Condemning negotiations amounts to preferring war, 
and this war will spread, we can be sure of that. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Some intellectuals criticize you for 
thinking in this way and not remembering the Bosnian Muslims, 
who are right when they demand the lifting of the arms embargo. 
We cannot both refuse to send our military forces to fight 
alongside them and refuse them the weapons they need. 
  [Mitterrand] This is a serious argument. This request for 
the lifting of the embargo which Mr. Izetbegovic made to me, has 
been examined. The permanent members of the Security Council 
did not act on it after detailed consideration. A likely 
aggravation of the conflict was feared. And, in the final 
analysis, I think that was wise. Today the chances of peace are 
emerging. They must be seized. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Could France not do more for Bosnia? 
  [Mitterrand] It has done more than anybody. But two years 
ago I announced that I would not send our Army into the former 
Yugoslavia other than for humanitarian reasons. I have been 
criticized. I have not deceived anybody. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In France, a large section of the 
parliamentary majority seems to be in favor of withdrawing the 
blue helmets. 
  [Mitterrand] The question would arise if the conference in 
which the Americans, the EU, and the Russians will participate, 
were to be delayed. The French proposal has the aim of bringing 
together, around one table, the interested parties and the three 
big powers, which have hitherto expressed themselves separately. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Could the conflict in the Balkans 
spread? 
  [Mitterrand] It could. But now that there is a sound 
agreement among the European powers, I hope that they will 
prevent contagion and have not forgotten the lessons of the past. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] The French and the Germans did not 
have the same positions in 1991 on the eve of the recognition of 
the independence of Croatia and Slovenia. 
  [Mitterrand] At all times in this century, the Germans and 
French have had different views in this region of the world. 
But these disagreements are no longer a pretext for a conflict 
between them. Instead, they prompt us to have discussions, to 
coordinate our approaches, to prepare solutions in keeping with 
the interests of the EU. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do you think that the United States 
looks favorably on the gradual and slow emergence of a common 
European policy? 
  [Mitterrand] At the beginning, the United States was very 
favorable to the Europe of the Treaty of Rome. Its attitude 
cooled later, fearing some competition. When Communist Europe 
collapsed, it saw the possibility of reducing its military power 
on our continent, which corresponded to the wishes of a large 
section of its public and Congress. But it tried to compensate 
for this reduction in military influence by an increase in 
political influence. Hence its initiatives on NATO's new 
missions. Any plan which, in its view, is likely to question 
NATO's role worries it. For instance, it did not like the plan 
for a European Confederation which I presented on 31 December 
1989 and which I have not abandoned. On the other hand, the 
CSCE, which encompasses the United States and Canada, suits it 
very well. The Partnership for Peace which it designed 
corresponds to its true thinking. But the Americans still have 
reservations about a strengthening of the European Community. 
It would be a good thing for them to support the Pact for 
Stability, which is a French initiative. I expect 
open-mindedness on the part of President Clinton which will 
change the present climate. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Will you accept Russia into the 
group 
of seven industrialized countries, as it has requested? 
  [Mitterrand] To give it associate status, yes. That is what 
we are already doing. It will be present in Naples, and that 
will be a good thing. Aside from that, it will have to 
stabilize and fully launch its economic recovery. It can do so. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Will you allow the Russians into a 
European security system? 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, Russia is European, it is in Europe, and 
it 
must form part of the European structures. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] From this viewpoint, is it possible 
to envision placing the French nuclear force at Europe's service 
one day? 
  [Mitterrand] French deterrence is intended to protect 
national territory and defend France's vital interests, which 
are not defined in advance but are interpreted by the head of 
state. If Europe reaches a point at which it can be regarded as 
a territory which is united enough to be defended against the 
same dangers, for the sake of the same vital interests, then I 
will be prepared to start such negotiations in France's name. 
This presupposes, we must be clear about this, a great deal of 
progress made in Europe. One of my successors will one day have 
to decide. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] The principle of French deterrence 
was one of deterrence of the strong by the weak. Some people 
now think that, because the East-West confrontation has ended 
and faced with countries like Iraq or North Korea, which are 
trying to equip themselves with nuclear weapons, it is 
appropriate to envisage deterrence of the mad by the strong. Is 
this your view? 
  [Mitterrand] Anybody who responds to a madman in this way is 
mad himself. We are not going to settle civil wars and regional 
or ethnic conflicts by nuclear bombs! As for preventive wars, 
you can see how they start but not when they end. At all 
events, my answer is a categorical no. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do events in Algeria represent a 
threat for Europe? 
  [Mitterrand] Yes, certainly. We have the right to fear the 
victory of fundamentalism. Of course, the Algerian people will 
do what they intend to do. You cannot be democratic at home and 
dispute another people's right to decide their own future. I 
hope that the economic crisis, which is greatly affecting the 
Algerian people, will not lead them to confuse the causes of 
their suffering and, in a reaction against the problems of their 
everyday life, reject everything which makes them a people of 
future and progress. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Does the information you have on 
the Algerian situation prompt you to think that we in France or 
the Latin countries are capable of encouraging a dialogue among 
those involved? 
  [Mitterrand] We have not reached that stage. The war of 
independence has left mental scars. France's cooperation may be 
useful and even necessary, but any form of paternalism or 
moralizing must be absolutely ruled out. France is a free 
country addressing a free and dignified country. This must 
govern our relations. Let us continue to be ready to help 
Algeria if it so wishes, when it so wishes. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] The situation in Algeria is already 
causing and could continue to cause further political rather 
than economic immigration in southern Europe, and in France in 
particular. Would it not be possible to grant visas and the 
right of asylum more freely? 
  [Mitterrand] We cannot yet talk of a wave of immigration. 
But the people whose lives are threatened, especially because 
they are opting for progress, should be able to find help and 
support in our country. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Given that the bloc system no longer 
exists, in what way would the existence of fundamentalist 
regimes across the Mediterranean hamper our economic exchanges 
and our political relations? 
  [Mitterrand] I do not claim that fundamentalism is an attack 
on the European countries. That is not in its interests. It is 
difficult to imagine what the fundamentalist leaders would make 
of their foreign policy. They would not be able to isolate 
themselves from the rest of the world. They will perhaps 
realize that nobody can impose his faith without failing in what 
gives dignity to any belief: respect for others. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Let us return to France. What is 
your assessment of the Socialists' experience in power? What 
are the major errors that have been committed? 
  [Mitterrand] Your question would really require lengthy 
consideration. First, it must be said that the Socialists have 
had a minority tradition in France, as has the Left as a whole. 
It takes extraordinary circumstances, in the real sense of the 
word, in order for the Socialists to prevail. This will occur 
again, as in 1981 and 1988. But the conservative forces remain 
predominant in major sectors of the media and in major financial 
centers, and the administration is still permeated with their 
ideology. We have probably imposed ourselves insufficiently on 
this administration. Teams that come to power with no 
experience of it find it difficult to redirect fundamental 
options, in the economic and financial field in particular. 
This is something that I would criticize on our part. The 
result is that we have reached certain compromises that gave the 
inaccurate impression that the Socialists were no longer 
Socialists. 
  But we must not exaggerate. Much has been done that bears 
our stamp and that cannot be abolished. We have transformed 
France, and we have tranformed it for the better: freedom, 
culture, social legislation, scientific research, 
decentralization, and so forth. But we have had to deal with 
the most serious crisis since the thirties, and this has reduced 
our scope for maneuver. Furthermore, European construction, a 
Socialist issue par excellence, has developed at a time when 
most of our partners were following Liberal ideas. Having said 
that, I am proud of the work done by the Socialist governments. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] What do you think is the biggest 
mistake you have made in your political career? 
  [Mitterrand] My political career is not over. We have not 
yet reached the time for a stocktaking. Historians will judge 
it. My greatest regret (I am not saying, my biggest mistake) is 
to have had to govern France during the worst of the crisis and 
to have been unable to end unemployment, or at least to reduce 
it, just as my predecessor could not, and just as the other 
Western governments, whatever their political color, could not. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] What is the difference between the 
Right and the Left today? 
  [Mitterrand] It is usually right-wingers who ask this 
question. As far as I am concerned, the difference is clear. 
Without espousing Marxist teachings, I think that what Marx 
wrote (and he was not the only one!) about the social classes 
remains true. There are some people who want to conserve, and 
others who want to change. There are those who profit from other 
people's work, and there are those who suffer exploitation by 
others. There are those who refuse to acknowledge that women at 
work are underpaid, even if equally qualified. Then there are 
those who want to correct this grave injustice, and so on and so 
forth, as in the Michel Sardou song. A great deal remains to be 
done with regard to equality of opportunity. The Left has made 
some progress, though not enough, in this direction. The Right, 
by nature, can only remain what it is. This will be apparent 
when its administration comes to an end. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do you think that there is a crisis 
of democratic representation, a questioning of politics and its 
representatives, a success for populism and its demagoguery? 
  [Mitterrand] This is what everyone is saying. But I, who 
have reached the age of 77, have heard this old story many 
times. I heard it at home when I was 7 or 8, then when I was a 
student. I heard it during the war. I heard it during the 
Fourth Republic. This old story has not changed. Of course, 
sometimes this criticism is well-founded. Let us not turn it 
into a theory. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Did people use to say the same 
things? 
  [Mitterrand] Almost. As a child, I lived in a small village 
in Charente where the priest, who was a good man, owned a pig 
and a bull. The pig was called "Herriot" and the bull 
"Painleve." That was not very respectful of the democratic 
institutions. But it did not alter the fact that the vicar 
became a very active member of the Resistance, and at the end of 
his life he told me: "There is nothing better than the 
Republic." 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Are the political classes bound to 
find other means of expression apart from the political parties? 
  [Mitterrand] Democratic life can only be expressed through 
groups of men and women that gather round a central idea, an 
ideal, a blueprint. This is called a party or a movement, a 
program and an ideology. They are indispensable to the 
Republic. Of course, they need to shed some bad habits. Now 
that the laws introduced under my incumbency by Michel Rocard's 
government have created the conditions for the establishment of 
higher ethical standards in public life, they have no excuse for 
not doing so. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Does a society dominated by images 
not change the qualities demanded from a politician? 
  [Mitterrand] Additional communication skills must be 
acquired. For that matter, you can find your answer in 
Ecclesiastes, which did not appear yesterday: "There is nothing 
new under the sun." 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do you think history repeats itself? 
  [Mitterrand] No. I mean, situations change, but the major 
issues, the major struggles, the major historical movements 
remain. It is the same struggle through the ages. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Of the politicians you have known, 
are there any that left a strong impression on you? 
  [Mitterrand] I have known some very intelligent men such as 
Austria's Chancellor Kreisky, whom I admired; Gorbachev, a man 
whose role was a decisive one in world developments; Willy 
Brandt, who was particularly astute perception, as were Schuman 
and Mendes France before him. I liked Leon Blum. I did not 
know de Gaulle or Churchill well. Their historical record 
speaks for them. Moreover, Mohammed V, Gandhi, Ben Gurion, and 
Mandela have shown that we can and must always hope. I have 
strong memories of Mao and Fidel Castro. I will not mention our 
European neighbors who are still in power in their own 
countries. But some of them will leave their mark on our era. 
We already know that. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] It is said that the end of 
communism, 
of the communist utopia, which was an extremist expression of 
reason, brought about a crisis of reason itself, and that we are 
therefore moving toward a form of messianism. 
  [Mitterrand] I believe, as you do, that forms of messianism 
will develop, but, because of a kind of permanent dialectic, so 
too will the forces of reason. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Will there be a great confrontation? 
  [Mitterrand] The great debate, as always! I am confident in 
the ultimate victory of reason. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Three years ago, speaking to UNESCO, 
you expressed your joy at seeing the peoples freed from 
communism. Having experienced the changes of the end of this 
century, do you maintain your optimism and your faith in mankind? 
  [Mitterrand] I have not been on bad terms with mankind, but 
I 
have always judged it true to itself. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Do you mean that it is sadly 
consistent? 
  [Mitterrand] Consistent, period. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] What feelings do world developments 
prompt in you? 
  [Mitterrand] I believe strongly in the institutions. There 
would be no social peace in a country without institutions, 
without elected representatives, without justice, without moral 
rules, without people to defend rights. Otherwise there would 
be so many instances like the shameful situation in Rwanda, 
which it is the responsibility of the world's most senior 
institutions to salvage from disaster.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Clinton and Pope Talk Longer Than </F>
Planned"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 2 -- The conversation 
in Vatican City today between United States President Bill 
Clinton and Pope John Paul II lasted forty minutes, ten minutes 
more than expected. 
  The Clinton motorcade entered Vatican City on schedule 
through the belltower gate to the left of St. Peter's basilica 
at exactly 11:50 [0950 GMT]. Bill Clinton thus became the tenth 
U.S. president to come within the precincts of this tiny 
independent state. 
  The President and his party, which included his wife Hillary 
and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, were welcomed in the 
San Damaso courtyard by the prefect for the Pontifical House, 
Msgr. Dino Monduzzi under the watchful eye of a platoon of Swiss 
guards. As this was not an official visit, no anthems were 
played. 
  As the Clintons were conducted through the magnificent rooms 
towards the papal library where John Paul awaited them, they 
admired with obvious pleasure the rich decor of paintings, 
frescoes, sculpture and furnishings which embellish the Vatican 
complex. 
  Despite his recent hip replacement surgery, the pope was 
standing up to greet Clinton as he crossed the threshold into 
the library. The two men then sat down in two armchairs to begin 
their private talk. 
  Clinton is the fourth U.S. president to be received in the 
Vatican by John Paul II. The others were Jimmy Carter, Ronald 
Reagan, and George Bush. 
  While the pope and the president talked, Warren Christopher 
immediately began talks in the nearby Hall of the Popes with a 
Vatican delegation led by Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo 
Sodano. At the end of the private conversation between the 
president and the pope, the rest of Clinton's party were 
introduced into the libary. 
  The first to enter was his wife Hillary who was wearing 
black 
and who had covered her head with a black veil in keeping with 
Vatican protocol. She was followed by her mother and then the 
other members of the American delegation. The usual exchange of 
presents took place after the pope greeted each of the visitors. 
  At the end of the papal audience, Clinton and his party 
proceeded to another part of the palace to join up with Cardinal 
Sodano, and American cardinals William Wakefield Baum and 
Casimir Szoka, who are members of the Curia. 
  Coming out of the audience, the U.S. president said that 
among the topics he discussed with John Paul II was the upcoming 
Cairo conference on birth control; the international situation, 
with special reference to Bosnia and the Middle East; the role 
of Islam; and problems of religious liberty in the world, 
especially in Asia. 
  Clinton said he was honored to have been received by the 
pope 
and he praised the willingness of the Catholic Church to cope 
concretely with problems. 
  The world assembly in Cairo on population, organized by the 
United Nations, came up again when Clinton stopped to talk with 
a group of American seminarians. The president said that he and 
the pope had discussed both what they agree on and what they do 
not agree on in this area, and said that they found a common 
meeting ground in their awareness of the need to uphold a 
responsible growth in population. Both men also reviewed the 
progress that has been made in the direction of responsable 
parenthood, he added. 
  The topic came up again when Clinton responded to questions 
put by a group of journalists. Unlike China, the United states 
does not support abortion as a means of birth control, he 
insisted. But his administration is concerned about the tens of 
millions of abortions that take place in unsafe conditions 
around the world, putting women's health and very lives at risk. 
  He admitted that "differences" exist between the United 
States and the Vatican on the matter of contraception, but he 
voiced the conviction that the thrust of the Cairo conference 
would be to support sustainable development and strong families. 
  Nevertheless, Clinton said that "progress" had been made in 
his talk with the pope. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers stressed that neither 
compulsory abortion nor abortion upon request were part of the 
Clinton Administration policy. Abortion must be safe, legal and 
rare, she said. Nevertheless, family planning and access to 
contraception are important means by which to control population 
growth so as to prevent massive migrations of people due to food 
scarcity and to fend off environmental degradation, the 
spokeswoman said. 
  Asked if the points of view of John Paul and the American 
president were irreconcilable, Myers would only say that she did 
not believe the pope would change his mind on these issues. 
  The two men have distinctly different views on abortion and 
family planning and have already clashed swords on the issues, 
including when the pope was in Denver last August, during the 
pope's appearance at the world youth celebrations there. The 
issue returned to the spotlight in New York last month during 
preparatory debate for the Cairo conference. [passage omitted] 
  Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro confirmed that the Cairo 
conference was in the front line of topics discussed by Clinton 
and the pope during the private audience. Although the two 
leaders had discussed a variety of international matters, 
including world peace in general and the situation in the Middle 
East and in Jerusalem, the lion's share of their conversation 
had pivoted on that UN-sponsored conference and the serious 
ethical questions it raises, Navarro said. The Holy See is 
deeply concerned with the defense and promotion of life and the 
defense and promotion of the family, and with this in view, the 
pope has appealed to the responsibility of a great nation like 
that of the United States which in its origins and throughout 
its history has always proclaimed ethical values to be at the 
basis of every civilization, the Vatican spokesman continued. 
  He added that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his 
Vatican counterpart, Cardinal Sodano, in their separate talks, 
had reviewed certain aspects of preparations for the Cairo 
conference and had discussed the chief problems having to do 
with international peace: Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, and 
"with special emphasis on peace in the Middle East and the 
future of the Holy City of Jerusalem," he said. 
  During his meeting with the pontiff today, Clinton also took 
the opportunity to thank the Vatican for having recognized the 
state of Israel and for the support it is giving to the Mideast 
peace process, it was later learned.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Warm Relations' Between Clinton, </F>
Berlusconi; Fini Satisfied"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- Visiting U.S. President Bill 
Clinton developed a "warm human relationship" with Italian 
Premier Silvio Berlusconi on the first day of his two-day visit 
here, Berlusconi told the press on Thursday evening [2 June]. 
  "Everything went well," Berlusconi told the press after a 
dinner in Clinton's honour this evening. "We have created a 
warm human relationship with Clinton and his wife." 
  Equally pleased at this evening's function was Gianfranco 
Fini, secretary of the National Alliance, who said that there 
was no echo of foreign press concern over the presence of his 
party in the governing coalition. National Alliance was born 
out of the Italian Social Movement, the political heir to the 
Fascist Party. 
  According to Fini, Clinton shook hands with the National 
Alliance leader and showed no reserve at all, "not even in the 
words he spoke when Berlusconi introduced me to him. Of course 
he knew perfectly well who all the people present were, and he 
was cordial with them all in exactly the same way." 
  "To me, Clinton seemed perfectly at ease," Fini added. "If I 
had to say in a word what did not emerge either this evening or 
this afternoon on the Capitoline, I would say it was 
embarrassment. There was everything but embarrassment." 
  Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, who replaced Northern 
League leader Umberto Bossi at tonight's dinner, explained 
Bossi's absence saying that the party chief had an appointment 
with his supporters which took precedence over a formal 
engagement. 
  Also present this evening was Left Democrat Party Secretary 
Achille Occhetto who said "I am happy to have met Clinton, who 
is one of the most dynamic and human politicians around. He is 
a brave man."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Friendship, History, </F>
at Dinner for Clinton"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 2 -- Premier Silvio Berlusconi 
dwelt on the 50-year friendship between Italy and the United 
States in a speech delivered after a dinner for visiting U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, official sources said. 
  "This afternoon, a beautiful Rome day and Michelangelo's 
Capitoline square...provided the perfect backdrop for bearing 
witness to and celebrating a friendship which has lasted half a 
century and which will certainly continue for more than half a 
century into the future," said the Italian government chief. 
  With Berlusconi and Clinton due in Anzio tomorrow to attend 
a 
ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing 
there, history also played a part in the premier's speech: "The 
friendship between our countries and the alliance between our 
democracies are born out of an act of liberation which laid to 
rest fascism and Nazi totalitarianism in Europe." 
  Italy's commitment to democracy was underscored by 
Berlusconi, who said "the new Italy which you see today, Mr. 
President, is a country which has rediscovered a taste for 
liberty and which is determined to defend tolerance and peace." 
  "We have learnt all that we should have learnt from our 
joint 
history," continued Berlusconi, "Now we feel free and we have 
hope in our hands. We do not want to remain slaves to the 
ghosts of the past. After many difficult years, a climate of 
trust and optimism has returned." 
  Leaders of all the major political parties were invited to 
attend the dinner, which took place at Villa Madama, but Umberto 
Bossi of the Northern League turned down his invitation at the 
last moment, citing previous commitments and sending League 
number two, and Interior Minister Roberto Maroni in his stead. 
  In a comment to journalists, National Alliance Secretary 
Gianfranco Fini, who was present for tonight's meal, recalled 
similar incident which happened during a visit to Rome by former 
U.S. President George Bush. "I was invited to see Bush while he 
was in Italy and I did the same as Bossi: I said I was busy with 
an election campaign. All lies: in fact, no one had warned me 
he was coming." [passage omitted] 
  More details about this afternoon's talks between Berlusconi 
and Clinton emerged this evening when the premier's press 
secretary Antonio Tajani disclosed that Berlusconi had confessed 
that he was known as the `Amerikano' in his youth. "I have 
always been very close to the position of the United States. 
They used to call me `Amerikano', written with a K, when it was 
very difficult and not at all fashionable to be on the side of 
the United States," Berlusconi told his guest. 
  Berlusconi's fascination with things American has either 
died 
down since then, or only went so far: when refreshments were 
brought in during the meeting, the Italian premier opted for an 
espresso coffee, while Clinton chose for a Coca Cola.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ennio Caretto: "Second Landing"] </F>
  [Text] On the Capitoline Hill, from which he will address 
the Italian people, in the Vatican, and at the Palazzo Chigi 
[government seat], this evening [President Bill] Clinton will 
issue to Europe what he describes as "the challenge of 
democracy." It is a political and economic challenge -- that of 
the integration of the former Soviet bloc into the Partnership 
for Peace (if not into NATO) and into a great trading community. 
But it is also a challenge between different generations -- 
that of continuity between the Liberation 50 years ago and the 
present struggle for democratic principles. Clinton will ask 
the young Europeans to avoid the mistakes of the thirties and to 
espouse the ideals of Europe's liberators. 
  His visit to the heart of World War II, which will also take 
him to Britain and France, culminating in Normandy, the scene of 
D-Day, will be an implicit appeal to the values of the 
Resistance. His security adviser, [Tony] Lake, said that the 
President will ask Europe to "display the same unity of intent" 
in strengthening democracy that it displayed on the battlefields 
against Hitler. At a time when neofascist thrusts are emerging, 
he gave to understand, Clinton's message will leave no doubts 
about America's position. 
  The choice of Italy as the first leg of his tour was no 
coincidence. His visits to France and Britain, the major allies 
in the conflict, were obligatory. But Italy was an enemy. "We 
have come here," Clinton will say, "to bring to your attention 
the fact that 1944 was the victory of a principle that unites us 
not only with Italy but also with Germany and Japan." And he 
will praise our country for what it did to free itself from 
fascism, and will not enter into the recent controversy over the 
AN [National Alliance] and Mussolini. 
  Clinton brings with him two specters -- that of Reagan, who 
10 years ago in Normandy put himself forward as the symbol of 
freedom from the Soviet Union, and his personal specter as a 
"malingerer" who dodged the draft for the war in Vietnam. It 
will not be easy to get rid of them. This is why he has 
prepared himself very carefully, with a daily diet of footage of 
the Anzio and Normandy landings and discussions with the most 
famous historians. 
  Clinton is the first American leader born since World War 
II: 
At the personal level his only link with it is his father's 
participation in the Italian campaign in a support unit based at 
Caserta (he never knew his father, who died three months before 
Bill was born). The President will defend the legacy of the 
builders of Europe. And he will consign it to the young people. 
His day tomorrow at the Nettunio and Anzio cemeteries will 
impart the tone to his entire European visit. Clinton will 
surround himself with World War II veterans. In practice he 
will show that America has forgotten nothing; that it is not 
isolationist; that it is Europe's big sister. There will be 
thousands of Americans there. The older ones will remember the 
bravery of paratroop General Maxwell Taylor, who in September 
1943 entered Rome secretly, woke up [Prime Minister Marshal] 
Badoglio, asked him whether the Eternal City could be conquered, 
and, having received a negative reply, halted the bombers that 
were already on their way. They will recall another event in 
1944 -- the lightning advance of Commander of the Fifth Army 
Mark Clark, who ordered his men to enter Rome by 1600 hours 
(they did so) in time to be photographed for the following day's 
newspapers. And they will return to America convinced that they 
have contributed to a historic turning point. Of course, there 
will be controversies. Over Germany's and Russia's exclusion 
from the commemorations, over Fini's assertion that his party is 
basically an Italian equivalent of the Gaullist party in France 
and of the Republican Party in the United States. But they will 
not spoil this great celebration for Italy and Europe.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Martino Reports to </F>
Foreign Affairs Committee"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 1 -- Italy will pursue work 
towards an initiative for the pacification of Rwanda under the 
aegis of the United Nations to avert the spread of that nation's 
crisis to neighboring states, beginning with Burundi, Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino said today in a statement to the Lower 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  After providing background on ethnic massacres in the 
African 
country and actions undertaken by the UN, the Western European 
Union [WEU] and Italy's humanitarian efforts, the minister 
announced further allocations of six billion lire (3.77 million 
dollars) in addition to the nine billion (5.66 million dollars) 
already earmarked for Rwanda. 
  The initial funds, said Martino, were set aside by the 
government "to heighten the operational capabilities of 
international agencies working in Rwanda and neighboring 
countries" and the six billion will go to help finance 
international aid agencies. 
  Responding to criticism that the Rome government "has not 
done enough," the minister said, "Whoever puts forward this 
accusation does not take a fundamental factor into account: the 
extreme difficulty of working inside a country shaken by a 
ferocious civil war, with precarious lines of communications and 
without the possibility of benefitting from local points of 
support." 
  With a view to appointments coming up in the near future in 
the UN, the Organization of African Unity and WHO quarters, 
Martino said Undersecretary Franco Rocchetta will visit Rwanda. 
  On Italy's past activities in the country, the minister said 
the Italian military evacuated 216 Italians from Rwanda plus a 
number of other foreign nationals and that Rwandan children have 
been brought to Italy. At present, he reported, still in the 
country are only five Italians who have decided to stay on to 
manage their communities. 
  In this connection, Italy has briefed the head of UN peace 
operations in Rwanda on the "precarious conditions" at 
orphanages in Nyamata and Nyanza. 
  In Brussels, said Martino, studies are under way on 
providing 
WEU logistical support for the UN peace force taking shape. He 
also spoke of the defense minister's affirmative response to 
"make a military transport plane available to UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda], the UN contingent in Rwanda." 
Also under examination is the prospect of setting up a hospital 
on the border between Rwanda and Uganda. 
  At various points in his statement to the committee, Martino 
underscored that, "A careful analysis of the political and 
military framework leads to the thinking that only actions of 
international organizations designed to achieve humanitarian 
interventions can be solidly successful in this phase of the 
emergency."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Israel To Freeze Its Relations With </F>
Rome"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- Israel has decided to temporarily 
freeze its relations with Italy. This came as a surprise move 
by [Israeli Prime Minister] Peres' deputy Yosi Beilin, intended 
as confirmation of Israel's condemnatory stance against the 
neofascist danger in Europe. The decision was made at the 
Israeli Foreign Ministry yesterday evening, following lengthy 
consultations, over a period of days with the Israeli Embassy in 
Rome. 
  Another plenary meeting is planned at the Foreign Ministry 
in 
Jerusalem for next week. It is being suggested that the 
complete freeze on relations may be lifted, and that the measure 
will only apply to AN [National Alliance] members. 
  A first practical measure was already taken yesterday with 
the decision to cancel a cultural mission to Rome, which was 
scheduled for early next week. Israeli Foreign Ministry sources 
explained: "We did not wish our representatives to meet the new 
Cultural Heritage Minister Domenico Fisichella, who is a 
National Alliance member." 
  The same sources added: "We had to choose between the logic 
of reasons of state, which leads us to greatly appreciate 
[Italian Foreign] Minister Martino's friendly statements 
concerning Israel, and our commitment to combat any kind of 
return to the totalitarian ideologies which developed in Europe 
in the first half of this century."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Piero Ostellino: "Alliances to the Test"] </F>
  [Text] Ours is an extraordinary country. When membership 
of the Atlantic alliance "cost little and yielded a great deal" 
(U.S. protection against a definite "enemy," the Soviet Union, 
in exchange for our relinquishing overly close relations with 
U.S. enemies) our membership was often challenged both by the 
opposition and by some sectors of the majority itself. 
  Now that membership of the Atlantic alliance "yields much 
less and costs more" (due to the disappearance of our "enemy" 
and the need to contribute to international stability outside 
Europe), there are more and more appeals for "Italy's loyalty to 
its alliances" even from the same people who used to challenge 
our membership. 
  Unfortunately, however, nobody has wondered what loyalty to 
the Atlantic alliance means now, after the crisis of European 
communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union have 
eliminated the historical, political, and strategic reasons for 
its existence; what loyalty to the European Union means, after 
international speculation caused the "explosion" of the monetary 
system, after the recession has called into question the German 
model of development (approved by the Maastricht Treaty), and 
after the Yugoslav crisis has revealed Europe's impotence. 
  The main concern has been to appear "loyal," without, 
however, explaining "to what" and above all without wondering 
what costs and benefits it entails for our country. Thus a 
great opportunity for a serious discussion of foreign policy has 
been wasted. 
  Having for years described our allies' reservations 
concerning the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] possible entry 
into the government as "an intolerable interference in our 
internal affairs," the Left has now applauded foreign criticisms 
of the appointment of National Alliance ministers. This shows 
that for many Italians national independence is optional, 
depending on whether it affects themselves or their adversaries. 
  The pressing need to immediately deny any possible suspicion 
of "fickleness" has prevailed. This is a praiseworthy political 
need, but it too is the result of guilt complexes and an 
approach to the new international situation that are entirely 
anachronistic. 
  Indeed, the concern with averting any suspicion of 
"elaborate 
footwork" seems to ignore the fact that "the music has changed" 
and that so too have the "dancers," that the major powers are 
able to keep to the same "beat"; that the important thing is not 
Italy's membership of the Atlantic alliance and the European 
Union but what specifically our country intends to do within the 
international bodies to which it belongs. 
  During the Cold War era we were one of the most loyal 
members 
of an "unequal alliance": The weaker allies (the Europeans and 
Canadians) were obedient inasmuch as they were protected, and 
the stronger ally (the United States) provided protection 
inasmuch as it was obeyed. Now that alliance, which was the 
result of the bipolar international system (the United States 
versus the USSR) is bound to change into a different kind of 
international system. 
  The allies' common democratic and liberal background is no 
longer enough to justify its existence. Neither is the aim to 
transform it generically into the "custodian of peace." What we 
need to consider is what the allies can still achieve, and at 
what price, and what problems are involved in transferring the 
alliance's original aims, which were defensive, to the new 
international context. 
  A medium regional power such as Italy is no longer bound to 
"passively" submit to the dynamics of the geopolitical or 
geoeconomic context within which it operates, but can seek to 
take part in it "actively." This has a whole series of 
implications for our country. 
  First, the international context has less impact than in the 
past on decisionmaking processes affecting our foreign policy; 
the prevailing national interest is no longer security, but 
economic development. 
  Second, the international framework has less impact than in 
the past also on the decisionmaking processes of our domestic 
policy; it is no longer a matter of reconciling objectives 
derived from our alliances with the presence of opposition 
forces hostile to them. 
  Third, the "scope of action" of our foreign policy is 
extending from the regional to the global, from the 
political-military to the economic, commercial, and cultural; 
new markets are opening up that were until recently closed to us 
either for security reasons (Russia and East Europe) or because 
of our "obedience" to our American protector (China). 
  Fourth, the rules of conduct to which we have subscribed 
remain (the need for loyalty); those connected with our 
membership of the Atlantic alliance, more flexible, and those 
connected with our adherence to international economic 
agreements, more full of opportunities. There are increasing 
incentives to bring the rules of the international market more 
into line with increasing international competition. 
  Very appropriately, having paid rhetorical tribute to our 
"loyalty to our alliances," Foreign Minister Antonio Martino has 
immediately engaged in foreign policy at the practical level, 
and has already imparted a more realistic approach better suited 
to the changed international conditions. Even the diplomatic 
corps which, despite a few "rotten apples," remains one of the 
best areas of the public administration, has established an 
internal "foreign policy organization" with the aim of placing 
its unquestionable professional expertise at the service of a 
new and more dynamic international action. 
  Why, then, not begin a major debate between the political 
forces and throughout the country on "what is to be done in 
foreign policy"? Why, basically, do we not abandon our 
provincialism once and for all? Prime Minister Berlusconi, 
Messrs. Bossi, Fini, Occhetto, Pannella, Buttiglione, Segni, and 
whoever else: Will you please try this, instead of wasting your 
energies on your own petty domestic quarrels?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poll Shows Stronger Polarisation </F>
for Eurovote"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- The Italian vote in the 
European elections on June 12 is expected to produce a 
substantial swing to Forza Italia and the Democratic Party of 
the Left, the two major parties in the conservative and 
progressive line-ups, a poll reported here today. 
  According to the SWG polling institute, Prime Minister 
Silvio 
Berlusconi's party should register 25 percent, compared to 21 
percent in the March 27-28 general elections, and the Left 
Democrats 23.2 compared to 20.4 percent. 
  In the general elections, the vote was held under the new 
mixed electoral system with 75 percent of the seats filled by 
winner- takes-all voting and the remainder proportionally. For 
the Eurovote, there is proportional voting for all the seats. 
  With a ban on the publication of poll results coming into 
force at midnight on Friday [27 May], SWG said that the 
ex-Christian Democrats of the People's Party would hold their 
ground in the centre of the political spectrum with 10.6 
percent, down by 0.5 percent. 
  The questioning of a sample of 6,600 voters on May 19 
indicated that, in the conservative ranks, the hard-line 
rightists of National Alliance would return an unchanged 13.5 
percent while the Northern League would lose 1.6 percent to 6.8 
percent. The Pannella Slate, also elected in the right-wing 
alliance on March 27-28, should fall to 2.2 percent. 
  On the left, the smaller parties were all seen as losing 
ground. SWG said the Network would drop from 1.9 to 1.1 percent, 
the Greens from 2.7 to 2.1 percent, Communist Refoundation from 
6 to 5.9 percent, and the partnership between Socialists and 
Democratic Alliance from 3.4 to 3.1 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Ettore Tamos: "The Prize Won by the Majority"] </F>
  [Text] Who has the most power in Italy after the 
election? One out of two Italians polled has no doubt: it is 
Silvio Berlusconi, who came in ahead of Wojtyla and Agnelli, the 
winners of previous competitions. Among the losers, Achille 
Occhetto and Umberto Bossi received record negative ratings. 
  Who is the most powerful person in Italy? The responses 
vary. 
The opinions obtained in these polls change rapidly, just as the 
mood of the voters does. "Gianni Agnelli," was the almost 
monotonous response given by Italians in past years to the 
Demoskopea and DOXA interviewers. There are no doubts expressed 
this year either, but the name has changed. "Silvio Berlusconi" 
is the response given by a chorus of voices to the SWG 
[Integrated Research Services] of Trieste] interviewers in the 
poll conducted for IL MONDO. 
  Was it because of the election results? Was it because of 
Berlusconi's showmanship as a politician and because he holds 
the office of prime minister? Surveys of public opinion have 
always been useful primarily for understanding the basic 
trends--the significant shifts--in public opinion, irrespective 
of the quantitative data, which may have been influenced by 
various factors. It was then discovered that the transition from 
the First to the Second Republic has also made politics a 
powerful factor. Moreover, the fact that for the first time in 
our history the head of government is also one of the nation's 
leading entrepreneurs and the owner of a large segment of the 
media serves to explain why one out of every two Italians (49.6 
percent) in the sample responded to the question, "Which public 
figure has the most power in Italy today?" by assigning primacy 
to the TV mogul. 
  Power, his adversaries say, to condition public opinion even 
through the medium of public opinion research--of surveys that 
bombard the public with Forza Italia's siren song and thereby 
help to create a positive halo around Berlusconi. According to 
this theory, even a public opinion poll is in effect a political 
spot [preceding word in English]. 
  The fact that the owner of Fininvest is the leader 
[preceding 
word in English] who possesses the greatest communications 
skills is acknowledged even by his severest critics. These 
critics, however, might be surprised to read a poll--similar to 
IL MONDO's poll--that was published by OGGI in 1988, at a time 
when Berlusconi was certainly less well-known and therefore 
merely a big businessman. In the OGGI poll, 34 percent voted for 
Agnelli; 20 percent for Berlusconi; 15 percent for Pope Wojtyla; 
and 10 percent for Bettino Craxi (the highest-rated politician), 
who came in ahead of Ciriaco De Mita, 7 percent; Francesco 
Cossiga, 4 percent; Giovanni Spadolini, 2 percent; and Nilde 
Iotti, 1 percent. These results were wiped out by the bribery 
scandal and by the new politics, except that the top three 
votegetters merely changed places. 
<H5>  But the Seniors Remain Faithful to the Polish Pope </H5>
  Here is the latest update: Berlusconi, way out in front with 
49.6 percent; second, Pope Karol Wojtyla with 19.7 percent; 
third, Agnelli with 7.4 percent. President of the Republic Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro came in fourth with 7 percent--a much higher 
rating than that received by his predecessor in Palazzo 
Quirinale, Francesco Cossiga. Fifth place (3.3 percent) went to 
a distinct newcomer, someone who could defeat anyone in the city 
[preceding word in English] of Milan and who is becoming 
increasingly better known even outside his profession: Enrico 
Cuccia, distinguished president of Mediobanca, the financial 
institution that has brought into its orbit the two big IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] banks that were 
privatized--Comit [Italian Commercial Bank] and Credit [Italian 
Credit Bank]. 
  The power attributed to the judiciary, however, proved to be 
illusory. Despite the fact that the Clean Hands pool [previous 
word in English] played a significant role in diluting the 
previous rankings of the powerful, the chief public prosecutor 
for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borrelli--who figured prominently 
in the TV reports of recent weeks--came in only sixth with a 3.2 
percent approval rating, which was slightly lower than that of 
Cuccia and slightly higher than that of Occhetto, the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] secretary who has come under fire 
since the election defeat of the progressive alignment. 
Occhetto, however, did come in far ahead of Northern League 
leader Umberto Bossi (despite his theatrical performance at the 
negotiating table, Bossi's rating failed to rise). And Deputy 
Public Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, the judge most beloved by 
the Italian people, did very poorly and was relegated--together 
with Craxi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini--to the 
small group of "others," which received a marginal rating of 0.8 
percent. 
  In this connection it should be pointed out that the poll 
was 
conducted by telephone using a sample that consisted of 600 
adults--a sample that although representative in terms of age, 
geographic area, and vocation did reflect various tendencies. 
For example, Berlusconi received a majority of the votes of 
young people; residents of the northeast; students; and 
white-collar workers of the private sector. On the other hand, 
support for the Pope increased in proportion to the increase in 
the age of the person interviewed, especially among pensioners 
and the residents of the south and the islands. 
<H5>  Diminished Role of the Federated Labor Unions and the PDS </H5>
  It is futile to look for confirmation of this statistical 
distribution in reality. Which public figure has undergone a 
decline in influence in Italy? Game, set, and match went in this 
case to Occhetto, who was far in front with 41.2 percent of the 
responses, followed by Bossi with 16.7 percent and Head of State 
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with 9.3 percent. Also losing influence, 
albeit to a lesser extent, were Agnelli (6.9 percent of the 
responses), followed by Wojtyla, Borrelli, Berlusconi, Cuccia, 
and Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. 
  The Clean Hands pool got its revenge when the most powerful 
organizations were ranked rather than the most powerful public 
figures. The Milan judges received 13.4 percent for third place, 
behind Forza Italia in second place--formerly occupied by the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party]--with 16 percent (the coalition of 
Forza Italia, Lega Nord and the National Alliance took fourth 
place with 11.4 percent) and most notably behind the Mafia, 
which took first place with 23.9 percent. The Vatican came in 
only fifth, with 7.1 percent. Mediobanca made its debut in sixth 
place with 5.8 percent, well ahead of the Bank of Italy (3.8 
percent) and Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian 
Industry] (3.4 percent). The labor unions (CGIL-CISL-UIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor-Italian Confederation of 
Trade Unions-Italian Federation of Trade Unions] (3.3 percent), 
the League (1.6 percent), and the PDS (0.9 percent) came in last 
but came in first in the follow-up questionnaire concerning the 
organizations that have lost influence in Italy, Here, the 
results of this questionnaire were predictable but not their 
dimensions, for the responses indicated a dramatic loss of 
influence by the CGIL-CISL-UIL (29.4 percent of the responses), 
by the PDS (20.1 percent), and even by the Mafia (12.4 
percent)--an indication that the action of the judiciary, 
together with the phenomenon of the penitents, are cause for 
hope that the phenomenon of the Mafia can be contained. Even 
League lost influence, according to the poll. 
  Agnelli's revenge, however, derives from a homogeneous 
sample 
of 100 entrepreneurs and managers who are qualified to give 
informed answers to a specific question, i.e., Which public 
figure possesses the greatest economic power in Italy today? 
Businessmen in particular felt sure they knew, and gave the 
president of FIAT 36.1 percent of their votes. Enrico Cuccia's 
reputation, however, has been rising sharply ever since the most 
recent operations in which his Mediobanca was at the center of 
the negotiations and was the only merchant banking [preceding 
two words in English] group capable of managing companies that 
were in crisis as well as managing the restructuration of 
holding companies, acquisitions carried out in foreign 
countries, and privatizations. This great director of Italian 
finance obtained 33.7 percent of the votes, mostly from 
managers. The current prime minister could do no better than 
third (26.5 percent), for Berlusconi is considered to be less of 
a "heavyweight" for the purposes of this target [preceding word 
in English]. Not much was left for Confindustria President Luigi 
Abete, who received only 1.2 percent of the votes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Debt Up, Public Sector Borrowing </F>
Requirement Down, Bank of Italy Says"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, May 23 -- National debt continues to 
move inexorably upward, but the public sector borrowing 
requirement [PSBR] is showing signs of slowing down, according 
to figures released Monday [23 May] by the Bank of Italy. 
  The national debt is fast approaching the 1800 trillion lire 
(1.13 trillion dollar) mark, according to the Bank figures which 
do not take account of the state railways, monopolies or 
telephones, which have recently been turned into joint stock 
companies. Were these included, the total would come to 1825 
trillion lire (1.14 trillion dollars). 
  Efforts by successive governments to bring the PSBR into 
check, thus improving the debt/gross national product ratio, 
seem to be bearing fruit, however, the Bank said, with the 
borrowing requirement for the first three months of this year 
standing at 41.690 trillion lire (26.2 billion dollars), nine 
trillion lire (5.6 billion dollars) down on the same period of 
1993. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Recovery Not Enough To Allay </F>
Deficit, Employment"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- Italy's public sector 
borrowing requirement could climb to 156 trillion lire (98.11 
billion dollars) in 1994, less than some pessimistic forecasts 
because of lower interest rates, and on to 160 trillion (more 
than 100 billion dollars) next year if no further corrections 
are applied to public finances. 
  The nation's GDP should grow by 1.3 percent in the current 
year and by two percent in 1995 but employment will shrink 
further in 1994, by one percent, according to ISCO [National 
Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], the short 
and medium-term economic studies institute which urged Italy to 
better exploit present and coming opportunities associated with 
recovery. 
  An ISCO report on the economic trend issued today said under 
consideration were forecasts based on no changes in economic 
policy. What surfaces, said the document, "is a picture in which 
not all opportunities, which do exist, are fully utilized. 
Economic growth would not acquire, therefore, the pace 
necessary to activate an additional commitment of productive 
factors, despite the presence of the improved financing 
capabilities of enterprise." 
  The institute said the rate of inflation can be expected to 
come down further but that Italy's low will still be above the 
rates in the other European Union nations and that the public 
debt can be reduced only in terms of the percentage of GNP. 
  The recent past, said ISCO, has shown the recovery signals 
are being consolidated as a result of reductions applied to the 
Bank of Italy's key discount rate, meaning a lower cost of 
money, and the generalized improvement of the world economy. 
However, the outlook for all of 1994 and '95 confirms that 
growth this year "does not appear to reach the consistency 
needed to revive investments and employment in a satisfactory 
way," the report added. 
  Following is a table of ISCO forecasts covering the major 
economic indicators with the percentages shown in real terms, 
that is, net of price variations: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Inflation is expected to continue downwards, slowly, to 3.9 
percent by the end of the year and to 3.5 percent in 1995. 
  Despite the "very modest dynamics" on the cost-of-labor 
front, the employment picture will not brighten, said ISCO which 
reported that the cost of labor per unit of production should 
increase by about one percent this year and by 2.5 percent in 
1995.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Big Improvement in Italian Balance </F>
of Payments"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- Italy's balance of payments 
showed a surplus of 4.056 trillion lire (2.55 billion dollars) 
for the first four months of the year compared to the figure of 
2.635 trillion (1.66 billion dollars) in the red at the end of 
the same period last year. 
  The Italian Exchange Office, UIC, reported today that for 
April alone, there was a deficit of 202 billion lire (127 
million dollars) and then compared this figure with the deficit 
of 3.478 trillion (2.19 billion dollars) run up in the same 
month in 1993. 
  According to data provided by the UIC, overall reserves held 
by the Bank of Italy came to the value of 91.488 trillion lire 
(57.54 billion dollars) at the end of April. 
  The surplus for the January-April period was produced by a 
deficit of 2.351 trillion in capital movements and a surplus of 
6.407 trillion under the headings of current accounts and 
commercial credits. These items for April alone were minus 
4.777 trillion lire and plus 4.575 trillion lire. 
  Following is a table of comparisons between April 1993 and 
April this year and the two four-month periods, in trillions of 
lire (one trillion equal to 628.93 million dollars):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  On the capital movements front, there was a strong outflow 
of 
capital in April of 5.895 trillion lire net which included 
foreign disinvestment valued at 4.231 trillion and loan 
reimbursements which came to 1.756 trillion. 
  Over the first four months of the year, however, foreign 
investments rose to the value of 59.413 trillion lire (37.37 
billion dollars) to put this item in surplus. Outbound Italian 
capital in April roughly equalled foreign capital disinvestment 
at 2.460 trillion lire with new loan outlays at 2.368 trillion. 
  The movements of bank capital in April came only to 1.118 
trillion lire because special credit institutes cut their 
foreign indebtedness by 2.064 trillion. At the end of April, 
the net foreign indebtedness of the Italian banking system came 
to 136.780 trillion lire (83.03 billion dollars).

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Catalan leader Jordi Pujol by </F>
David White; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan leader, 
wants "substantial agreements" on economic, labour and regional 
policies as a condition for continuing to prop up Spain's 
minority Socialist government. 
  In an interview, he expressed confidence in the 
determination 
of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's embattled government to tackle 
corruption. But he warned that if it failed to take effective 
action "we will have to withdraw our support." 
  Mr Pujol is the guarantor of the government's survival as Mr 
Gonzalez tries to overcome a serious crisis brought about by a 
succession of corruption scandals involving members of his 
administration, including a former central bank governor and a 
former head of the Civil Guard. 
  Mr Pujol, who is president of Catalonia's regional 
government 
and of the Catalan nationalist party, Convergencea i Unio, took 
a calculated gamble last week by reaffirming his backing for Mr 
Gonzalez in the midst of the political crisis. 
  As long as his party's 17 deputies vote with the socialists, 
Mr Gonzalez is assured of a narrow majority in the 350-member 
parliament. Mr Gonzalez also received a pledge of support from 
the Basque Nationalist party, which is similarly conservative in 
its economic views and has five seats. 
  Mr Pujol set out four priorities: 

  -  Further measures to 
support industry and exports, through tax policies. This would 
include backing for research and development and special 
assistance for small- and medium-sized companies; 
  -  Labour 
deregulation. Mr Pujol left open the question of whether 
additional measures would be needed after the government's 
current package of labour reforms, due to be implemented 
shortly. "We have to see how it works in practice," he 
said. 
  -  Transfers to Catalonia. Mr Pujol said he did not want to 
renegotiate the agreement reached last year under which 15 per 
cent of the income tax normally raised by the central government 
in Catalonia is remitted directly to the Catalan regional 
government. But he had specific demands on arrangements for 
financing the region's health system and the building-up of its 
own police force. 
  -  Stemming corruption. Mr Pujol said he had 
demanded that the government "do everything to control 
corruption" and added: "I think it is doing it." 

  He made clear that, despite his renewed support for the 
government, he would not consider joining a coalition. Mr 
Gonzalez said last week that a coalition -- such as he tried to 
form after last year's general election -- would provide more 
stability than a parliamentary pact. However, Mr Pujol said 
that being part of the government would leave his party with "no 
capacity for manoeuvre." 
  "The truth is that we can be more useful outside the 
government than inside it," he said. 
  He would not set any time-frame for his alliance with the 
socialists. 
  The two parties will confront each other in municipal 
elections next spring and in elections for the Catalan regional 
government in 1996. 
  "In two years we do not know what will happen," Mr Pujol 
said. 
  Mr Gonzalez has, meanwhile, secured backing from his party 
to 
place one of his moderate allies, Mr Joaquin Almunia, as its new 
parliamentary leader, replacing the former economy minister, Mr 
Carlos Solchaga who resigned last week. 
  Mr Almunia was labour and civil service minister in previous 
Socialist governments.

<F P=106> [Report by Veselin Stoykov: "Understanding, Cooperation </F>
Needs Language of Truth"] 
  [Text] Thessaloniki, May 25 (BTA) -- Understanding and 
cooperation in the Balkans need the language of truth... We 
oppose the export of internal problems of separate countries, 
Greek Minister of Macedonia and Thrace Dr. Konstandinos 
Triaridhis told Bulgarian journalists in Thessaloniki on May 24. 
He stressed the need for the promotion of Bulgarian-Greek 
economic cooperation, including the establishment of new 
transport links. The meeting coincided with the visit by 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov in Athens. 
  Dr. Triaridhis said the ministry in his charge implemented 
the policy of the Greek Government. He elaborated on Greek 
views on development in the Balkans. According to him, all 
countries in the regions, including Greece, have their share of 
problems. Greece is a member of the European Union whereas 
other Balkan states, including Bulgaria, would like to join in, 
and integrate into European structures. Greece would like to 
help those countries, from which it would benefit itself. 
Hopefully, these Balkan states will have made progress in some 
ten years, including Albania and Skopje, said the Greek 
minister. Greece is trying to help cope with difficulties, he 
said. 
  He said Greece is glad about meetings such as that with 
Minister Daskalov. But it also would like to see livelier 
contacts among non-governmental bodies, among journalists, 
business and ordinary people. He cited recent meetings in Varna 
and Khaskovo. According to Triaridhis, the strengthening of 
economic cooperation in the Balkans and especially between 
Bulgaria and Greece can benefit integration between the Middle 
East and Central Europe. 
  Dr. Triaridhis elaborated on the Greek stand on Skopje. He 
said that if Skopje leaders show willingness for dialogue in the 
Balkans, Greece was ready to lift the embargo today, not 
tomorrow, but Greece could not tolerate manifestations of 
fanaticism in Skopje. According to him, these manifestations can 
create problems for Blagoevgrad and Sofia, and involve Greece 
and Albania, too. Greece opposed a time bomb that might explode 
in some five years. The Skopje problem is a problem for the 
Balkans, said Triaridhis. According to him, it is a paradox that 
Bulgaria, which is in the same situation as Greece, supports the 
name of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. 
  The Greek minister stressed that the war in Bosnia should 
end 
as soon as possible. Involvement by Turkey, Albania and others 
would only aggravate it. He also commented on the long-lasting 
embargo on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) which has severely hit Greece and Bulgaria. 
According to him, it is very bad that Balkan countries let 
foreigners manage the situation is the Balkans. 
  The Greek minister focused on major guidelines for the 
development of Macedonia and Thrace, that concern not only 
Greece but can have a positive impact in other Balkan countries, 
especially Bulgaria and Albania. According to him, this is of 
interest to the Bulgarian Government. Dr Triaridhis said there 
were no minorities in Macedonia and Thrace but religious 
communities that have all the rights and obligations of Greek 
citizens.

  [Text] Geneva, June 2 (AFP) -- The International Committee 
of the Red Cross [ICRC] called Thursday [2 June] for a ban on 
the some types of "inhuman" weapons currently being developed, a 
statement said. 
  In particular the ICRC is concerned about laser weapons 
which 
can blind, arms using microwave and infrared technology, and 
allegedly nonlethal chemical weapons. 
  The call for the ban came after an ICRC-organized meeting of 
experts Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the dangers of certain 
types of weapons, some of which have already been produced. 
  The experts expressed concern at the possibility of such 
weaponry coming into the hands of terrorists or criminals, in 
particular in the case of laser arms. 
  The experts will draw up a report detailing their 
conclusions, to be presented to a conference of government 
experts to debate amending the 1980 UN convention on arms. The 
conference will be held at the end of the year.

<F P=106> [Article signed FDS: "Airplane Manufacturer Wants To Build </F>
Factory in Brustem; Investment Worth 7 Billion Francs and 300 
Jobs"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] At last year end, a businessman 
from Limburg contacted Flemish Minister Johan Sauwens (The 
People's Union) with the good news that his customer, a 
"naturalized Dutchman," according to official sources, while 
other sources refer to two rather questionable Germans from 
Dsseldorf, would like to invest some $200 million in Limburg. 
The purpose is to service Russian-built helicopters and to 
assemble small Russian airplanes in the new plant. Since the 
fall of the Berlin wall and the elimination of the Iron Curtain, 
the Russian aviation industry is trying to acquire a share of 
the Western market through dumping prices. Giant Russian 
helicopters are frequently used in the West because they have a 
bigger lifting capacity than their Western counterparts, so it 
makes perfect sense that their servicing also take place in the 
West. 
  The Russian airplanes are allegedly worthy equivalents of 
U.S.-built Cessnas or German-Dutch Fokkers, and are said to be 
interesting on account of their price-quality ratio and their 
cargo capacity. An aid organization such as Doctors Without 
Frontiers, for instance, could easily convert them into 
ambulance airplanes, a tempting argument that the potential 
investors eagerly put forward. In addition, the investors also 
have Russian exclusive contracts for the servicing of 
helicopters and for the delivery of the necessary spare parts.

  [Text] Brussels, June 3 KYODO -- The European Union (EU) 
seeks cooperation with Japan in dealing with energy and 
environmental issues, according to the EU's vice president in 
charge of science and technology attending next week's joint 
forum in Tokyo. 
  Antonio Ruberti said Thursday [2 June] he looked forward to 
Japan-EU comprehensive cooperation socially and economically to 
deal with a number of issues, including global warming and the 
reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. He 
indicated he would also take up the issue of Japan-EU 
cooperation in ensuring the safety of nuclear energy when he 
confers with Japanese Government officials in Tokyo. Ruberti is 
scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on Tuesday for the forum on 
cooperation on science and research that was established last 
October on the basis of a joint declaration in 1991 by Japan and 
the European Community, as the EU was then called. 
  Among the Japanese scheduled to attend the forum opening 
Wednesday are Mikio Omi, director general of the Science and 
Technology Agency, Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu and leaders 
of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).

<F P=106> [Franco Papitto report: "Waltz of Candidates for New </F>
European Power"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The negotiations have been going on for 
a number of weeks, involving the most important countries of the 
industrialized world. Coming up for renewal are the top 
positions in some of the fundamental institutions for the 
"government" of the West. According to various indiscretions, 
yesterday in Mulhouse Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand are 
said to have agreed on a sort of organizational diagram of 
international power. Maybe it is not quite like this, also 
because the German chancellor and the French president are not 
the only ones to decide. But it is certain that the question 
has been discretely debated, also that Western chancelleries 
have entered into a period of feverish activity. Time is 
pressing as the first stage in this appointments marathon is 
scheduled to take place in Paris on 7 and 8 June, at the OECD 
ministerial meeting which ought to appoint the organization's 
secretary general. Then the EC's heads of state and government 
will be seeing each other at Corfu on 24 and 25 June, to appoint 
Jacques Delors' successor at the European Commission. This will 
be followed by the appointment of the director of the WTO (World 
Trade Organization), destined to succeed GATT, and the successor 
to the seriously ill Manfred Woerner as NATO secretary general. 
  The problem worrying Kohl and Mitterrand is the presidency 
of 
the European Commission. They got themselves into trouble by 
prematurely promising to support Netherlands Premier Ruud 
Lubbers. Kohl's liking for Lubbers vanished when Lubbers 
criticized German reunification. Mitterrand has never been an 
enthusiastic supporter of the Netherlander, whom he also chided 
for showing a "scant spirit of solidarity" during the Uruguay 
Round trade negotiations. To undermine Lubbers, the two did not 
nip in the bud the candidacy of Leon Brittan, the British 
Conservative currently in charge of EC trade policy. They had 
him advance, with vague promises, then suggesting the name of 
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, a sanguine Fleming who 
has rarely put his foot outside his country's borders. 
  Lubbers put his foot down: to torpedo his candidacy would 
represent an "unacceptable affront to the Netherlands." Leon 
Brittan has not backed off, even if he has become aware that he 
is losing punches. A difficult discussion is looming at Corfu, 
a blockage to be avoided at all costs because it would transform 
into a quarrel an appointment which traditionally takes place by 
general consent. And then Lubbers could be kept quiet by 
granting him the function of NATO secretary general. The OECD 
could be offered to Great Britain, leaving it to the London 
government to choose between former Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Nigel Lawson, the present candidate, and Leon Brittan. Dehaene 
would then get the job at Corfu for lack of opponents. 
  But, for the OECD, the game is more complex because it 
includes not just European players. The United States is 
supporting the candidacy of Canada's Donald Johnston, whilst the 
French have not lost hope that the job will finally go to their 
Jean-Claude Paye. From Washington the idea has been flown of 
possibly supporting a European candidate at the WTO in exchange 
for the EC countries supporting Donald Johnston for the OECD. 
In this complex scenario, the FINANCIAL TIMES about two weeks 
ago launched the name of former [Italian] Foreign Trade Minister 
Renato Ruggiero for the WTO secretaryship. The best tipped 
candidates, according to the English newspaper, are "the Italian 
Ruggiero and Brazilian Minister Ricupero." For the OECD 
secretaryship too, Ruggiero would be a possible compromise 
solution between Johnston and Paye. 
  As a result, this matter has also been taken up with 
[Foreign] Minister Martino in his first international contacts. 
Martino, who has been supporting the suitability of an Italian 
presence at the top of one of the organizations regulating world 
trade and world economy, apparently has begun to ask for 
guarantees on the jobs to be given to the two Italian members of 
the next European Commission, for which have been put forward 
the names of Enrico Vinci, the present Secretary General of the 
European Parliament, and [Radical leader] Marco Pannella.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by unattributed </F>
correspondent; place and date not given: "The Chances According 
to the Chancellor"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [KNACK] As is the case 
elsewhere, there is a chance that voters will come out against 
the government and reject membership in the European Union (EU). 
  [Vranitzky] Some people will turn against the government in 
the referendum. However, I do not expect their number to be 
very large. Should the Austrians reject Europe, we will not 
interpret their "no" vote as a motion of no confidence in the 
coalition. 
  [KNACK] Your coalition partner has a large number of voters 
in regions that are against EU membership. You encountered 
difficulties in keeping the OeVP [Austrian People's Party] on 
the European path. 
  [Vranitzky] Not in principle. Ever since the Social 
Democrats embarked on EU membership with the People's Party, 
our partner has always been in favor of accession. The OeVP 
proved more hesitant, and was more restrained in its pro-Europe 
statements. It did not recommend accession that fervently in 
public. Our "yes" sounded more solid, which will not, I hope, 
prevent things from running as we intended. 
  [KNACK] The result of the popular referendum will influence 
the upcoming general elections. 
  [Vranitzky] It is probably too soon to make a statement 
about 
that. I am not afraid of any link being made between the 
referendum and the general election. However, for the time 
being I assume that both events are not linked together. 
  [KNACK] Why do you want to see Austria join the EU at all 
costs? 
  [Vranitzky] There are many reasons for this. Three of them 
form the basis of my personal conviction. First, there is 
currently a contest under way between continents. And Austria 
must strengthen Europe in that contest. Second, we cannot solve 
a number of issues, such as environmental and transportation 
problems, by ourselves. Issues of transnational importance are 
best solved within a larger, European connection. Third, a 
country that is in the middle of the continent cannot remain a 
spectator on the sidelines. Austria is European historically, 
culturally, and also in terms of popular mentality. We must 
regard our membership as participation in one of the largest 
projects for decades. Only by adopting a common position will 
we be able to resolve the major issues. So we are not willing 
to form small alliances, like a German-speaking bloc. This is 
with a view to combating specific temptations. 
  [KNACK] Who is that statement aimed at? 
  [Vranitzky] At anyone who harbors doubts about our openness. 
Despite the agreements regarding language and culture concluded 
with Germany, we also enjoy equally good relations with a number 
of other countries. We are talking about so-called industrial 
nations. Admittedly, worldwide industrialization is making it 
increasingly difficult to justify that kind of terminology. 
Since the first oil crisis in the early 1970's, the number of 
jobs in industry has been on the decline. It is not enough to 
have forecasts made, then sit back and wait for the predictions 
to come true. We must work on the future of Europe together. 
  [KNACK] Farmers and environmentalists have an almost 
instinctive distrust of Europe. Many other people in your 
country fear that standards will decline, both socially, from 
the point of view of consumers, and as regards democracy. 
  [Vranitzky] Businessmen are now convincing company employees 
that the quality of Austrian life will not decline. As in other 
countries there is criticism of decisionmaking in the EU. 
Understandably so. The citizens of West Europe are used to a 
democratic game being played in their country, one in which they 
feel more closely involved than in the mechanism of the EU. 
They can scarcely accept less democracy. In order to prevent 
that, the European Parliament will, in the long term, have to 
play the role of legislator more emphatically. 
  [KNACK] You came to Brussels to talk with European 
Commission 
(EC) President Jacques Delors, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, and Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes. 
  [Vranitzky] One of the topics that cropped up was the 
construction of a railroad line linking Munich and Verona. That 
line would run through western Austria, so as to alleviate a 
number of problems associated with road transport (via the 
Brenner Pass). The railroad line will feature on the agenda of 
the European summit to be held in Corfu at the end of June 
(making it a referendum trump card against resistance from 
anti-Europeans in the Tirol). 
  [KNACK] Did you also come to lend your support to Dehaene as 
a candidate for the post of EC president? 
  [Vranitzky] I have no comment on that. As is the case with 
the questions concerning the qualified majority with which 
Europe will make important decisions in the future. It is not 
good to send too many signals out into the world on subjects 
such as that, or to voice my own personal opinion. Austria is 
not eavesdropping. The referendum must be held on the basis of 
the issue in question. The debate must not be allowed to 
founder over some statement made in connection with a partial 
aspect. 
  [KNACK] Are you more in favor of deepening or enlarging the 
EU? 
  [Vranitzky] Equally in favor of both. European integration 
requires both intensification of its contents and a broadening 
of its framework. In my view, the prime aim must be to deepen 
its contents. 
  [KNACK] Will the constitutionally neutral Austria remain 
outside the WEU [Western European Union], Europe's defense 
community? 
  [Vranitzky] It is not out of the question that Austria will 
join the WEU in the capacity of an observer. However, we are in 
no hurry to do so. Incidentally, a large number of questions 
regarding defense remain to be settled between today's 12 member 
states and the WEU. 
  [KNACK] In Italy, the government now includes some 
neofascists. How do you deal with that fact? 
  [Vranitzky] I would have preferred it if our neighbor's 
government had not included any neofascists. However, I respect 
the choice of the Italian people. We will try and enjoy equally 
good relations with the new government as we did with previous 
governments in Rome. We must allow ourselves to be guided by 
what emerges from our working relations, not by prejudices.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina by Klaus </F>
Grubelnik; place and date not given: "`Certain Reserves'"] 
  [Text] [Grubelnik] Minister, the Wifo [Economic Research] 
Institute paper on "Austria in the European Union [EU]" has 
predicted a budget shock for 1995. Net borrowing will be 35 
billion schillings higher than without joining the EU. Has the 
course of budget recovery thus failed? 
  [Lacina] I have great doubts about this figure. Of course 
there will initially be a higher burden on the budget, but I 
will certainly not accept that everything that is related to EU 
accession will be classified as new burden. A large part of it, 
for example in the sphere of subsidies for agricultural sector, 
industry, and labor has to be financed through shifting funds: 
Those industries that will benefit strongly will have to make a 
solidarity contribution in favor of those that are exposed to 
major difficulties. All in all, the crucial thing is the 
alternative, and that is not joining the EU. 
  [Grubelnik] What does that mean for Austria? 
  [Lacina] We are in the middle of a phase of upswing and are 
benefiting from an investment drive, because people are already 
expecting EU membership. If this expectation is thwarted, then 
it will mean insecurity and a flagging economy. Last year, we 
were able to experience dramatically the effects of low economic 
growth on the budget when our deficit jumped up 34 billion 
schillings over the draft budget. I much prefer a higher burden 
as a result of an offensive strategy to one that is caused by a 
slump in the economy. 
  [Grubelnik] Yet, the Wifo has not exactly predicted 
thrilling 
results for the economy as a result of our accession to the EU: 
The economic research experts expect an accumulated additional 
growth of 2.8 percent up to the year 2000. 
  [Lacina] That is not the point. The point is what will 
happen if we do not join the EU. Then businesses will simply 
reduce investment. In the event of unemployment, the EU will 
set up trade barriers against third countries and discriminate 
against them. The Wifo simply did not work out the costs of 
non-membership, and these costs would be very high. 
  [Grubelnik] It is indisputable that EU membership would 
produce an additional burden on the budget. Under the motto of 
"What happens if nothing happens," the Wifo has predicted the 
net deficit to explode to 5.2 percent in 1995, while debt would 
skyrocket from the current 56 percent of GDP to 70 percent. 
Would we still be able to cope with that? 
  [Lacina] I am used to counteract predictions with the 
appropriate measures, which is what we are going to do this 
time, too. We will mainly look at the spending side, because we 
do not want to stiffle growth with higher taxes. Besides, these 
contributions cannot be financed exclusively by the Federal 
Government alone, but the provinces and communities will also 
have to contribute. All of Austria is going to join, not just 
the Federal Government. This will require tough negotiations 
for financial equalization. Since we managed to finance the 
main bell in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral with the help of 
the provinces [after World War II], we might be able to make 
such a national effort together with regard to the EU. 
  [Grubelnik] Will there be massive privatization campaigns to 
finance the extraordinary burdens? 
  [Lacina] Privatization revenues are not permanent revenues, 
even though they can help prevent short-term budget shocks, 
which is what we have done time and again in the various stages 
of the tax reform. We still have certain reserves. 
  [Grubelnik] Yet, sooner or later the VAT [value-added tax] 
rates, which are 5 percent lower in Germany, will have to be 
cut. This will cost the budget another 20 billion schillings 
per year. 
  [Lacina] The VAT rates are lower in Germany, while in Italy 
they are about the same. There is also a 5-percent difference 
with Denmark, but there these rates are higher. Denmark also 
shares a border with Germany and can afford higher VAT rates. 
We will look at the matter from the point of view of 
competition policy. Anyway, I receive proposals for new taxes 
on a daily basis, and I might feel like introducing one or the 
other and cut the VAT. 
  [Grubelnik] All in all, Austrian farmers will get 117 
billion 
schillings in compensation payment for losses suffered from EU 
entry, about half of which will be provided from the Austrian 
budget, the remainder from the EU. Has the farmers's support 
for EU entry been bought? 
  [Lacina] Distributed over a period of four years, the 117 
billion schillings are about the same as what the farming sector 
has received in direct and indirect subsidies so far, namely 
28-30 billion schillings per year. Some of this money came from 
subsidies from the state budget, some from artificially high 
prices to be paid for by the consumers. Without EU membership, 
the farmers would also have to put up with lower agricultural 
prices as a result of the GATT agreement that was adopted last 
December -- but without getting full compensation. I do not 
rule out that some farmers, for example those in Alpine regions, 
may be better off as a result of EU accession.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Leo Delcroix by Paul </F>
Goossens; place and date not given: "A Government Program Based 
on Security"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Goossens] What happens if 
Prime Minister Dehaene leaves for Europe? 
  [Delcroix] That will be a very serious problem because 
Dehaene is far more than the engine of the government. He is 
also its bodywork. I see two possibilities. Either we finish 
gracefully and the elections are advanced to early 1995--I am 
not radically opposed to that--or we find a new prime minister 
and succeed in updating the government program. We cannot 
continue for another year as we are doing now. Public opinion, 
which must be considered, would not accept that. In any case I 
want to do so, because I can thank public opinion for a great 
deal. Without the public's support, I would perhaps not have 
succeeded in abolishing national service. 
  [Goossens] What would be the main points of that new 
government program? 
  [Delcroix] The emphasis must be on the security problem and 
fighting crime. Then there are immigration policies. A time 
must come when we have the courage to say that the country is 
saturated. We must put a figure on that. Then we must also take 
adequate measures against the illegal immigrants. I do not 
think that we must reintroduce borders, but we must organize 
something, and also take measures for combating drugs. In my 
view, the Army can and must play a role here. It could be 
deployed in this area. In the community field, I support more 
homogenous packages of powers. I also feel that the federal 
state should be more than a skeleton. It must also have 
substance; otherwise it cannot survive. 
  [Goossens] The Flemish Bloc will take pleasure in many 
points 
in your program. 
  [Delcroix] I am not a fan of the Flemish Bloc, and I do not 
call for it to be brought into the government. However, I think 
it is wrong to isolate it. It is bringing up problems that have 
been neglected by the other parties, including the immigration 
problem. 
  [Goossens] Are the Flemish Liberal Democrats an ideal 
coalition partner for you? 
  [Delcroix] That is not self-evident. Much will depend on how 
the electoral campaign is conducted, and just like everyone else 
they will have to make compromises after the elections. I 
belong to the right wing of the Christian People's Party (CVP), 
and that makes me unacceptable for some positions in the eyes of 
the French-speaking Socialist Party. This does not bother me, 
however, nor does it bother me that in the CVP there are people 
who have a far greater interest in the welfare sector than the 
business world. We are a true people's party.

<F P=106> [Report signed J.Ve.: "Herman van Rompuy, Leo Delcroix, or </F>
Melchior Wathelet -- The Tug of War for Dehaene's Successor Has 
Already Begun"] 
  [Text] The leader of the Belgian federal government, 
Jean-Luc Dehaene, is remaining stubbornly silent on the subject 
of his possible move to the European Commission (EC). He has 
never even given official confirmation that he has any ambitions 
for this post. However, following the recent French-German 
summit, it looks more and more as if those two countries intend 
to venture out on European waters under Dehaene's captaincy. 
  It is not yet clear who might become head of the federal 
government after Dehaene's departure. The CVP [Flemish 
Christian People's Party] is only permitting itself the 
observation that it would feel flattered if one of its members 
was asked to take on the EC leadership. However, more than 
this, CVP headquarters simply will not say. Who should be 
Dehaene's successor? "Only if Dehaene should decide to go away, 
which is still not necessarily the case, will the question of 
his succession figure on the agenda." 
  So far, the CVP has two hotly tipped candidates: Herman van 
Rompuy and Leo Delcroix. However, strangely enough, neither of 
these two appears to be raring to lead the government. Earlier 
on, Leo Delcroix humbly admitted that he still lacked the 
competence to perform such a duty. Was that genuine modesty on 
the part of the politician, or merely tactics? Herman van 
Rompuy, too, has repeatedly made it known that he has no great 
enthusiasm for taking on the leadership of the government. Here 
again, the question as to genuine or false modesty must be 
asked. 
  Could the CVP suddenly let the leadership of the government 
slip out of its hands? Influential members of the CVP in the 
chamber say that this cannot happen. Whispers in the corridors 
of Parliament would suggest that the CVP must not be allowed to 
relinquish the presidency of the federal government, especially 
now that the fruits of the restructuring policy are slowly 
beginning to ripen. Within the CVP, not everyone is convinced 
that this viewpoint is correct. It is pointed out that it is 
precisely the group that turned down the prime minister post in 
1992 for the CVP in March 1992 that is now demanding it. So 
it does not look as if we have a dogfight on our hands here. 
However, even if there is no such fight, there is a third party 
which is certainly hungry for one. Gerard Deprez, the president 
of the PSC [Walloon Christian Socialist Party] has already on 
more than one occasion thrown some encouragement in the 
direction of Deputy Prime Minister Melchior Wathelet. Wathelet 
speaks excellent Dutch and is therefore, even if he increasingly 
answers in French questions put to him in Dutch, an acceptable 
candidate in this respect. However, the disadvantage is 
Wathelet's reputation as an eternal skeptic. So far the 
Citizens' Charter has had no success, but that criticism is 
partly unjustified, because security cannot be guaranteed by 
laws and decrees. 
  Should Wathelet succeed Dehaene, there might be a problem of 
parity. According to the Constitution, there must be an equal 
number of Flemish and Walloon ministers. Nonetheless, as far as 
this parity goes, no account has been taken of the community to 
which the head of the government belongs, who is assumed to be 
above any Flemish-Walloon differences. Ever since this parity 
has come about, there has been an equal number of Flemish and 
Walloon ministers, but Wilfried Martens and Jean-Luc Dehaene 
were not counted. Were the rule implemented, Wathelet's place 
as Dehaene's potential successor would have to be taken by a 
Walloon minister, as opposed to a Fleming. However, people say 
there is no need for this. The Constitution says that the 
government must number as many Dutch-speaking as French-speaking 
ministers "perhaps with the exception of the prime minister." 
So the word "perhaps" could be taken to mean that Wathelet can 
be included for the purposes of parity. However, with 15 
ministers, it will become impossible to maintain parity if 
Wathelet is counted as a Walloon. Unless he is divided down the 
middle.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marie-France Cros: "Rwanda: `Respectable' </F>
Racism"] 
  [Text] The savagery of the extermination of opponents, 
Tutsis, and intellectuals in Rwanda is appalling. For this 
situation to explode, however, it was helped along by complicity 
which was all the more fearsome since it was "innocent." 
  President Habyarimana's regime was nothing other than 
fascism. It had the same qualities: It concentrated on 
development just like Mussolini's draining the Pontine Marshes 
and Hitler's building freeways. It clearly had the same faults: 
A single-party dictatorship, a frenzied cult of personality, 
and nationalist exaltation, since it was understood that only 
Hutus are true Rwandans, because the Tutsis were supposed to 
have come from Egypt; and moreover, only Hutus from the north 
were real Hutus, since those from the south were too associated 
with Tutsi blood and culture. 
  During those years, the Europeans, Belgians in particular, 
but also the French, could find nothing to complain about. Yet, 
the missionaries, volunteer workers, and politicians had either 
experienced World War II, or else learned at school that fascism 
and systematic exclusion led straight to the "catastrophe" that 
was the Jews' Holocaust. 
  They know this so well that none of them today would dare 
describe Jews as being miserly, dirty people with hooked noses, 
which was the typical caricature before the war. Nevertheless, 
we often heard our compatriots, not all of them (!), involved in 
Rwanda blandly explain that "the Tutsis are intelligent and 
treacherous while the Hutus are dolts but nice," meaning that it 
made sense for the former, who were dangerous, to be subjected 
to discrimination, so that the latter, semi-innocent group could 
flourish. 
  The truth is that you come across imbeciles in power when 
they find themselves in power for no other reason than their 
ethnic, regional, or political origin, whether we are talking 
about the Tutsis in yesterday's Burundi, or Hutus in Rwanda. 
Not only do they not need to be competent to take power but if 
they are intelligent, are they not being "ridiculous" if they 
study, since their future is guaranteed. 
  The majority of our missionaries, our many volunteer 
workers, 
and our politicians has long turned a blind eye to Rwandan 
fascism, thus adopting a "respectable" racism and preferring to 
believe that General Habyarimana ran "the Switzerland of Africa." 
  In the fall of 1993, the extremist Hutu radio station, Radio 
Mille Collines, began broadcasting. They teach us at schools 
that fascism plus radio equals a dangerously explosive cocktail. 
However, the gentleness of the Rwandan hills must blur school 
memories. We had to wait until December 1993 and the arrival of 
the first Belgian blue helmets, who were immediately targeted by 
Hutu extremists because they had come to help enforce the Arusha 
peace agreements, before many Europeans opened their eyes and 
realized that the anti-Tutsi and antiopposition campaign was no 
more tolerable than the anti-Belgian campaigns of the 
extremists. Too late.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Military Probably Will Be Sent to </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Text] If the security situation in Rwanda improves, the 
Netherlands Government is after all prepared to contribute a 
unit of 20 military police to UN missions in the country. 
  A previous UN request was refused by the government, because 
the Netherlands had already provided enough soldiers for UN 
peacekeeping operations. The situation in Rwanda is also too 
dangerous, as Netherlands soldiers are likely to be mistaken for 
Belgians. Belgian soldiers have already been killed in Rwanda. 
The Second Chamber found the latter argument unconvincing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Wilton Named in Taiwan Scandal"] </F>
  [Text] The Schiedam shipyard company, Wilton Fijenoord, has 
been named in a major defense scandal in Taiwan involving a 
large section of senior naval officers. 
  A top-ranking member of the military was sentenced to life 
imprisonment this week. The 37-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Liao 
Chih-wei apparently revealed military secrets to the agent of a 
Netherlands company. In the CHINA TIMES, this company was 
identified by civil servants of the Taiwan Defense Ministry by 
the initials "W.F." Seven other officers have been charged, 
together with 10 arms dealers. Chuang Ming-yao, the commander 
of the Taiwan Navy, was forced to resign in April because of the 
affair. 
  Director T. Jonker of the Schiedam shipyard company stated 
that it was all "a complete mystery" to him. Jonker: "We have 
not built any frigates since the 1970's, and we have never 
supplied Taiwan with any frigates. In 1987 and 1988 Wilton did, 
however, supply Taiwan with two submarines." Jonker also said 
that the shipyard company has no agent in Taiwan, but 
representatives often travel between the two countries to 
maintain contacts.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephan Koole and Wilco Boom: "Purple Coalition </F>
One Step Closer"] 
  [Text] The PvdA [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for 
Freedom and Democracy], and the D66 [Democrats 66] have reached 
agreement on the main terms of a major package to provide around 
9 billion guilders [G] in tax cuts. Almost half of the tax cuts 
will enable companies to employ low and unskilled workers at 
lower costs. 
  The parties negotiating for a "purple" coalition [comprising 
the PvdA, the VVD, and the D66] agreed that structural 
unemployment is one of the country's major problems. The 
partial agreement brings the formation of the new government 
closer, it is being said within the potential coalition parties. 
  The party specialists, brought together within the so-called 
A Team, are recommending that their party leaders (Kok, 
Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo) allocate around G5 billion to 
resolve this problem. They want to use that money to reduce 
costs to the employer. 
  Insiders point out that the agreement is a "first step." The 
party specialists did not consider the effect of the proposed 
measures on incomes. "They will have to discuss this with the 
politicians appointed by the crown to assess the feasibility of 
the various coalitions." 
  Despite this partial agreement, the extent of spending cuts 
remains the principal point at issue during negotiations on the 
formation of a government consisting of the PvdA, the VVD, and 
the D66. The threatened new financial shortfall of G3 billion 
is playing a part in the negotiations. PvdA leader Kok believes 
that the negotiators must find a solution to make up for this 
deficit. 
  Kok: "I have a sort of double role, negotiator on the one 
hand and finance minister on the other; it is therefore in my 
own interest to prevent complications, as otherwise it is I who 
will have to face them later." 
  Kok believes that the G3 billion deficit is "not casting a 
shadow" over negotiations between the three parties. 
  Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo were once again optimistic 
yesterday about the prospects of forming a "purple" coalition.

<F P=106> [Report by Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Britain has stopped targeting Russia with nuclear 
missiles, the Ministry of Defense announced today. The move is 
in line with an agreement signed by the prime minister and 
President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin last February 15 which 
involved a thousand Russian missiles and about 160 British 
weapons. The United States and Russia also stopped targeting 
each this week. 
  An MoD [Ministry of Defense] spokesman said the computers 
which guide British weapons "no longer routinely hold targeting 
information." The weapons were detargeted on May 30. Targets 
which were "held in readiness for insertion into the missiles" 
will be points in the open ocean, he added. 
  The MoD described the move as a "positive demonstration of 
the developing cooperative relationship between the United 
Kingdom and the Russian Federation."

<F P=106> [Article by George Jones: "Major Scorns Opposition's </F>
`Craven Euro Surrender'"] 
  [Text] The European elections campaign came to life 
yesterday following Mr John Major's call for a "multi-speed" 
Europe. 
  Domestic rows over economic policy and street beggars were 
bypassed as Labour and the Liberal Democrats rounded on the 
Prime Minister, claiming he was relegating Britain to Europe's 
second division. 
  But Mr Major again made the campaign running launching a 
strong defence of his call for a more "flexible" Europe and 
accusing opposition parties of a "craven" surrender to Europe. 
  He said his call for a Europe in which member states were 
free to do "some things in their own way" was in tune with 
public opinion. 
  With the campaign past the half-way mark, he said the 
Conservatives were the only party addressing the important 
European questions and resolutely committed to a realistic 
assessment of Britain's place in Europe. 
  "So far we are the only party which has not played fast and 
loose with the national veto. We are the only party 
unequivocally committed to maintaining the veto," said Mr Major. 
  Addressing a Tory campaign conference in London, Mr Major 
stood by his call for a "multi-speed, multi-track, multi-layered 
Europe." 
  He said it did not contradict his original aim to see 
Britain 
at the heart of the Community and described talk of Britain in 
the "slow lane" of Europe as defeatist and old-fashioned. 
  A multi-speed Europe was already happening, and he cited an 
agreement between France, Germany and the Benelux countries to 
dismantle their border controls -- a policy not adopted by other 
EC members. 
  European governments had to note a "sourness" among voters 
towards the way the Community was developing. 
  "I approach this question from the angle of someone who 
wishes to see Europe succeed. This is a very great venture. It 
is vitally important it is not pushed aside by sourness and 
moving too rapidly. We have to carry the people with us." 
  Emphasising the Government's determination to maintain the 
veto on policies affecting Britain's vital national interests, 
he said Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be at the "tail 
of Europe," following policies advocated by other states. 
  "That is the most craven foreign policy I have ever heard 
from any British political party. If that is the policy of 
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they have forfeited every 
conceivable right to be trusted in Government with British 
foreign policy." 
  Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Mr Jack Cunningham, 
accused Mr Major of trying to play "hokey pokey" with Europe: 
"In-out, shake it all about. It is a recipe for a weak Britain 
in a strong Europe." 
  He said it was vital for Britain to be up with those in the 
fast lane in Europe. 
  But the message from Conservative Britain to its EC partners 
was "go ahead without us," he added. 
  Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader' said Mr 
Major's two-track Europe speech could mark a "historic" turning 
point in British politics -- which could pave the way for the 
Tories to become Britain's anti-European party, like Labour in 
the 1970's. 
  In Edinburgh, he said: "It was a speech which revealed at 
once the weakness of his leadership and the poverty of his 
ambition for Britain."

<F P=106> [Article by Julie Kirkbride: "Chapter Puts Jobs at Risk </F>
Says Major"] 
  [Text] The Social Chapter risked plunging Europe into a 
depression not seen since the 1930's the Prime Minister said 
yesterday. Speaking in Nottingham Mr John Major sought to focus 
the Tories' election campaign on the Social Chapter which he 
claimed would destroy jobs and damage the employment 
opportunities for those out of work. "If it costs more to take 
on staff" businesses will employ fewer people. It is all very 
well to think about the rights of people in work. But I care 
about those without work as well." Decrying plans in the 
Socialist manifesto for a 35hour-week and a minimum wage, he 
said: "We won't beat the Far East where factories are humming 
six days a week -- and frequently seven -- by packing our bags 
for a three day weekend in Skegness. We don't need to work 
less, we need to work harder" he said. The people who would pay 
the price of employment protection policies would be young 
apprentices looking for their first job and office cleaners who 
would face the sack if firms had to pay a minimum wage. In 
raising the spectre of unemployment, Mr Major also claimed that 
Europe now faced the worst crisis since the 1930s. Over the 
past 20 years Europe had created only 8 million jobs, while the 
USA had created 36 million. Mr Major was also unrepentant about 
his policy shift earlier this week, when he signalled that 
Britain could opt out of further political and economic 
integration in the EC. "I do not propose to change my ways," he 
said. "Because I want Europe to succeed I will be critical where 
I must, difficult if I have to be. "I would rather speak up and 
put the case for what I know to be right for Britain, than clink 
glasses in agreement with something that is wrong," he added. 
In a phone-in for BBC Radio Nottingham earlier in the day, Mr 
Major was concerned to explain the benefits of belonging to the 
European Union. It was vital to jobs to remain part of the 
trading bloc as 60 per cent of British exports were destined for 
the Continent, he said. He also claimed that it was vital to 
peace and stability.

  [Text] LONDON -- Several Kashmiri groups here have taken up 
cudgels against Pakistan following Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's reported statement that Islamabad will oppose any 
independence for Kashmir. 
  "The struggle against India could become a struggle now 
against Pakistan," said Mr Arzal Tahir, President of the Jammu 
and Kashmir People's National Party. 
  There are signs of that already. Four members of Pakistan's 
National Assembly were hooted down at meetings in Birmingham and 
Bradford. The Pakistani embassy had to mobilize strong support 
to prevent this from recurring in Luton, north of London. Luton 
has a large population from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir [POK]. 
  At a recent meeting at the School of Oriental and African 
Studies, where the Indian case was argued by former Foreign 
Secretary J N Dixit, several Pakistani speakers were strongly 
challenged as the Pakistanis presented their arguments about UN 
resolutions and human rights. 
  Among those who challenged the Pakistanis was Mr Anwar Khan, 
who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Peace Committee. "There are so 
many flaws in their arguments, but people have been too scared 
before to challenge them publicly," Mr Khan said. 
  He has been challenglng Pakistan's claims to Kashmir openly 
at meetings now. The mood is beginning to change, he said, 
adding: "There is a realistic element coming in now, a 
realisation that Kashmir will never go to Pakistan." 
  The Pakistani strategy, he said, had been at first to 
encourage groups that sought independence. "Once the whole thing 
seemed to be gathering momentum, they put forward Tehriq 
E-Kashmir which wants Kashmir for Pakistan," he said. "Now many 
in the pro-independence groups are feeling betrayed." 
  Most pro-Pakistan groups in Britain have membership from the 
Mirpur and Kotli districts of POK. They have Pakistani 
passports, which give the Pakistani High Commission a hold over 
them. 
  "But even among them they are beginning to realize that 
Pakistan has its own agenda, and that they are being used," Mr 
Khan said. "This will not be a question of India or Pakistan but 
of democratic rule versus theocratic rule." 
  A visible change is that groups opposed to Pakistan's claims 
have begun to come into the open. Dr S Durrani set up the 
Indo-European Kashmir forum two years ago primarily to speak for 
the plight of Kashmiri pandits [Bhramins]. Its members have now 
begun to campaign aggressively against Pakistan. 
  "People were a little afraid at first because of the murder 
of Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre," Dr Durrani said. "But we 
have now put that behind us." Mr Khan's group and Afzal Tahir's 
group have also begun to speak critically of Pakistan's claims 
at public meetings. 
  Mr Ifthikar Malik and Mr Mohammed Arif, two well known 
academics who oppose human rights violations in Kashmir, also 
oppose Pakistan's claims. The Pakistani lobby has also 
indirectly lost the support of British MPs.

<F P=106> [Article by Deric Henderson, Joe Quinn, Moira Whittle, </F>
Jackie Burdon, Peter Woodman, and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS 
ASSOCIATION News] 
  [Excerpt] Twenty-nine people, including elite members of 
the RUC's [Royal Ulster Constabulary] Special Branch, Army 
officers and Northern Ireland Office officials died tonight when 
an Army helicopter crashed into a hillside in a remote part 
western Scotland. 
  Police said the Chinook helicopter came down in thick fog 
while on route from RAF Aldergrove in Belfast to a security 
conference at an Army base at Fort George, Inverness. There 
were no survivors in the crash which happened at around 6 pm, 
approximately 700 yards from a lighthouse on The Mull of 
Kintyre. The RAF said the dead included four crewmen and 25 VIP 
passengers. 
  Strathclyde chief constable Leslie Sharp told a midnight 
news 
conference in Glasgow that the dead passengers included 10 top 
RUC men, nine Army officers and six senior officials from the 
Northern Ireland Office. 
  At least six of the dead were men in charge of the secret 
war 
against the IRA in Northern Ireland. They are believed to 
include RUC officers up to and above the rank of chief 
superintendent. 
  Mr Sharp said all 29 bodies had been found and were removed 
from the crash site, about to a temporary mortuary at 
Machrihanish just up the coast. "At this time there are no 
reasons whatsoever to suspect that we are dealing with anything 
other than a terribly tragic accident," he added. 
  Some of the dead men would have had access to the most 
sensitive intelligence in the fight against the IRA and would 
have been regularly travellers to Britain to update forces on 
the mainland. One was said to be particularly wellknown in 
London and was due to retire soon. 
  Both the lighthouse keeper and a woman out walking heard the 
impact of the 51ft twin-rotar aircraft on the windswept hillside 
and reported seeing a fireball. 
  Five Navy and RAF Sea King helicopters, local fire crews and 
lifeboatmen, coastguards, medical crews from Glasgow and 
specialist RAF mountain rescue teams all converged on the scene, 
10 miles from Campbeltown, but there were no lives left to be 
saved. 
  Wreckage on the ground was reported soon after impact but 
the 
search for survivors was hampered by the same thick fog which 
experts suspect may have caused the crash. At some points 
visibility was cut to 10ft. 
  Colleagues of the RUC men tonight said they were stunned. 
"The force is devastated," said one. "It seems the upper echelon 
of the Special Branch is missing. We can't believe this has 
happened." 
  No names of the 29 dead were being released until relatives 
had been informed. 
  One RUC officer said: "These people were right at the heart 
of intelligence. These were the men who made the Special Branch 
tick. It's a devastating blow. It's impossible to explain such a 
loss. Everybody is reeling." One of the dead RUC men was in 
charge of the Special Branch's source handling unit -- the team 
which monitored the flow of vital information supplied by the 
IRA's informers all over Northern Ireland. The officer added: 
"This is a grievous blow which can't be underestimated. The 
place is in a state of shock and bewilderment. All these guys 
had their finger on the pulse. They knew everything." 
  Whitehall sources were giving no details of the precise 
nature of the Fort George conference, but it seems to have been 
intended to deal with military and police strategy in the war 
against terrorism in Northern Ireland. Fort George is a base 
for the Royal Scots. The conference was being staged there 
simply because it is a large base with plenty of rooms and 
facilities -- and in an out-of-the-way and secure location, 
military sources said. 
  Both John Major and his Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
were being kept informed on developments tonight. An MoD 
[Ministry of Defense] spokesman said armed forces minister 
Jeremy Hanley would fly from London to Machrihanish in the 
morning to visit the crash site and talk to members of the 
emergency services. 
  The wreckage was strewn over one square mile of remote 
hilltop, 30 minutes' drive from Campbeltown, the nearest 
settlement and an air exclusion zone was put in place tonight. 
  Earlier, neither police nor the RAF would give casualty 
breakdowns but one rescue source said: "The guys are working in 
the wreckage to get bodies -- it's as grim as that. The debris 
has been strewn over a huge area and everyone is there -- 
police, military personnel, everyone. The weather is still 
appalling -- fog, rain and high wind." 
  Captain Donald Black, of the Campbeltown Lifeboat Services, 
said the scene suggested the helicopter had hit the ground and 
then skidded, or cartwheeled for a distance. Aviation fuel had 
also spilled and caught fire in the heather. 
  Tonight in Glasgow, Mr Sharp said first impressions 
indicated 
that bad weather had caused the Chinook to hit the hill and said 
locals remembered many similar crashes during the Second World 
War. But he stressed that the cause of the crash had still to be 
determined "and this will obviously take some time." [passage

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rudolf Wassermann: "Lessons of Magdeburg, or </F>
Signals to the Police"] 
  [Text] Some time has passed since the events in Magdeburg 
on Ascension Day; and this enables us to say more than could 
have been said while the discussion was still characterized by 
justified dismay. There is no doubt that the police have 
failed. For many hours they did not turn up at all, 
preservation of evidence and cooperation with the Federal Public 
Prosecutor did not work. What is the point of having a "Police 
Concept for Fighting Political Extremism and Xenophobic Crimes," 
which the interior minister sent to police stations in January, 
if it does not produce any results in practice? 
  What happened in Magdeburg is nothing new, though. Police 
have made mistakes in the old laender as well. We still 
remember the picture of a police officer being chased through 
the streets of West Berlin by rampaging leftist gangs on 1 May 
1989 -- before reunification. 
  In the new laender, the situation is aggravated by manpower 
shortages and a lack of motivation. People say that in Dresden 
you have to report a murder to get a policeman to the scene of a 
crime. In Saxony-Anhalt, police vehicles are said to be 
reluctant to go to the scenes of crimes, but they would rather 
go as far away from it as quickly as possible -- after all, you 
do not want to risk your life because of some criminal. Such 
reports are certainly exaggerated, and one should be careful not 
to make sweeping judgments. But there is no harm in knowing 
what the difficulties are that police authorities are facing. 
  The Federal President made a welcome statement, saying that 
it is hard to grasp how hooligans and right-wing extremists 
could hunt down people in the middle of a big city and be 
released after having been detained. Such a clear statement had 
been long overdue. As long as the perpetrators came from the 
left-wing scene, appeasement was the order of the day. Only 
since right-wing extremists have started imitating and outdoing 
the other end of the spectrum and since -- last but not least -- 
effective solutions have been demanded abroad, the mood has 
changed. 
  Political signals for a more severe fight against extremist 
violence can, however, not be put into practice without 
problems. The existing laws especially prevent this. 
Admittedly, criminals that are caught red-handed can be 
detained by police officers without an arrest warrant -- but 
this is only possible if they are suspected of escaping, if 
their identity cannot be established, or if there is imminent 
danger providing sufficient cause for an arrest warrant. In the 
interest of the freedom of the individual, the limits of the 
latter have been set out very narrowly, also, and especially, as 
far as the danger of recurrence is concerned. The judiciary is 
meticulously monitoring the observance of these limits, and 
police officers have been told to follow them strictly. In 
addition, there is the possibility of protective detention to 
avert danger (up to two days in Saxony-Anhalt). 
  Police are bound by these laws. Before criticizing police 
actions, one should be aware of this situation. Otherwise, one 
might get the impression that the police are accused of obeying 
the law. 
  On the other hand, the Magdeburg events once again underline 
that the laws urgently need to be adapted to the changing 
circumstances. The coalition's 1994 Crime Prevention Act, which 
is meeting with resistance in the Bundesrat, will improve this 
situation considerably. It is high time that the police and 
judicial authorities are provided with instruments that are more 
suitable for fighting violence -- especially right-wing 
extremist violence -- than the existing ones. Further delays 
would be irresponsible. The given law has become a test case 
that will show whether politicians are willing to fight violence 
effectively, doing something beyond expressing dismay.

<F P=106> [Opening address by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi </F>
at joint news conference with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Rome on 2 Jun] 
  [Text] I would like to begin by thanking President Clinton 
for beginning his stay in Europe--during which he will 
commemorate the liberation America brought to us, the liberation 
from fascism and from Nazi totalitarianism--here in Italy. We 
had an interesting meeting in which I was able to explain 
directly the situation in Italy: the new government and its 
program, the background behind our new electoral law, as well as 
Italy's willingness to continue with our international treaties 
and obligations. I told President Clinton that Italy has always 
sought a climate of closeness with the United States 
specifically, as well as with international organizations. 
  Next, we discussed international political issues. We will 
be honored to have President Clinton as our guest in Naples for 
the G-7 summit. Economics will be the key theme at the summit; 
above all the question of employment, which is difficult to link 
with the issue of technological development. This question 
affects every country in the West. 
  We then viewed the current world scene and discussed the 
necessity of international organizations being able to intervene 
more quickly and efficiently in the various regional crisis that 
bring so much pain and suffering to the local populations. I 
then expressed to President Clinton our gratitude for that which 
the United States, along with its allies, accomplished 50 years 
ago. These 50 years for us have meant freedom. To put it 
bluntly, without that freedom which President Clinton sees here 
today in Italy, there would not have been a rebuilt Italy, which 
came with the sacrifice of so many young American lives. We 
remember this and it is because of this sense of commemoration 
and friendship that we have given this welcome here to President 
Clinton and his entourage.

<F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Rocco Tolfa] </F>
  [Text] Despite the visit of Bill Clinton, today turned out 
to be a black day for the ruling coalition, which saw itself 
divided and loser of a second battle in the war for the 
chairmanships of the Senate committees. Silvio Berlusconi tried 
to play down the matter, but the Senate affair is sending shock 
waves through the ruling coalition. Rocco Tolfa reports: 
  [Tolfa] The curtain has fallen on the battle of the 
committees and the result leaves little room for doubt; a 
clear-cut eight to five victory for the opposition. This is 
enough to push the coalition partners into finding those 
responsible for the defeat. In the Senate the idea of calling 
fresh elections is gaining ground. This specter has been raised 
by the Northern League, which is demanding either a 
clarification in the ruling coalition or fresh elections. The 
National Alliance has also raised the specter of fresh elections. 
  [Begin Giulio Maceratini recording, shown on video] 
Extending 
the ruling coalition is a possible option and calling for fresh 
elections is another possibility. Certainly, as things stand it 
is impossible to govern the country. [end recording] 
  [Tolfa] The climate is certainly one of settling scores. The 
Northern League has called Forza Italia and the National 
Alliance amateurs because despite not having enough seats in the 
Senate they insisted on shutting out the opposition. 
  There is speculation that the supporters of Silvio 
Berlusconi 
and Gianfranco Fini engineered the split in order to call an 
early election. Forza Italia and the National Alliance retort 
that Umberto Bossi is guilty of having organized an ambush on 
the ruling coalition, and the proof is the agreement with the 
opposition to elect a Northern League Senator to the 
chairmanship of the Television Commission. This is certainly a 
thorn in the side for the government alliance. 
  Della Valle, the leader of the Forza Italia group in the 
Senate, warned that they had put up with Bossi long enough and 
that the Italian Popular Party will be invited to join the 
ruling coalition. 
  The opposition parties are ecstatic. Cesare Salvi, from the 
Democratic Party of the Left, said that the ruling coalition 
wanted a naval battle and they had got it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Roberto Poletti at Cortina on 1 June: "Professor Miglio? An 
Attack of Arteriosclerosis"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poletti] Mr. Bossi, what can 
one say! You certainly know that this morning [Northern League 
ideologue] Miglio invited people not to vote for the League, but 
to place their trust in the federalists campaigning in the other 
parties. 
  [Bossi] Yes, but this does not affect me. Look, given that 
we are in Cortina, I will use suitable terms of comparison, to 
enable you to understand me better. The League is the big 
mountain, Miglio the little stone in the stream who believes he 
can destroy it. Therefore, Miglio is no more than a poor deluded 
man. 
  [Poletti] And in this context, what is [Prime Minister] 
Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] The old man who cannot be older. 
  [Poletti] Miglio does not think this way.... 
  [Bossi] The poor man. I just wish him good health. 
  [Poletti] In other words? 
  [Bossi] Nothing, simply that he is suffering from a 
hyperchronic form of arteriosclerosis which has led him recently 
to perform some equestrian circus tricks. 
  [Poletti] Now the test of the European elections is coming 
up 
for you. 
  [Bossi] We shall certainly do well. The fact is the European 
Parliament does not, in fact, exist. It is nothing more than a 
fiction. In fact we are sending an important mayor there in the 
person of Formentini, because Strasbourg serves him as a 
sounding box. Nothing more. 
  [Poletti] If you will excuse the comment, Berlusconi seems 
to 
be slightly more pro-European than you, at least in his 
intentions.... 
  [Bossi] Come on. If there really did exist a European 
Parliament able to pass legislation -- and hence to operate -- 
his dealings would have no place, he would have his hands tied. 
A European Parliament which really had life in it, he would not 
think twice about bringing it to you on TV. And he would have 
to given up everything. These recycled Forza Italia people have 
every interest in putting their hands on Europe as well, 
precisely in order to prevent the community mechanism from 
working. 
  [Poletti] And our own Parliament, will it be able to work if 
you begin quarreling every day? 
  [Bossi] Things will go well when all the others have 
disappeared. The old faces, the recycled people, those who 
place indifference to politics in front of ideals. 
  [Poletti] Berlusconi, I imagine.... 
  [Bossi] All the recycled persons, in general. Those who want 
to place a brake on the process of renewing this country. Those 
who tolerate the existence of a magistrature which is rotten to 
the core. 
  [Poletti] We are here at Cortina, in the mountains of Pope 
Luciani [John Paul I]. Someone has said that you two have one 
thing in common. Both of you have had a very brief pontificate. 
Does saying this to decree the end of Bossi strike you as 
blasphemous? And then, are Bossi and the League finished? 
  [Bossi] The facts will tell. For the League I foresee 
success in the future. We will grow further. Absolutely. I 
have come here precisely to reassure my people. And to make 
sure that we force those who have come into politics to make 
promises and to keep them all, from the first to the last.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "Only Crazy People With </F>
Bossi"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- "Friends, colleagues, it must be clear to 
everyone that this government will not last the duration of the 
legislative term.... We have done our utmost to build a stable 
majority, but we have not succeeded, and the result is that this 
strong majority does not now exist.... But this must not 
frighten us: We have been underestimated in Parliament and are 
improving in all the opinion polls. We apparently already have 
over 25 percent.... And we are ready for any eventuality." It 
was shortly after 1100 yesterday, up on the fifth floor of the 
parliamentary group offices, which are connected to the lower 
house by a long elevated walkway. A meeting of Forza Italia's 
100 deputies was under way. Silvio Berlusconi spoke in his 
twofold role as government leader and leader of the 
party-cum-movement founded five months ago. And he spoke off 
the cuff, taking advantage of the fact that no reporters were 
admitted to the room. 
  He talked about the future, about alliances, and about 
strategies. He declared war on [Northern League Secretary] 
Umberto Bossi -- "someone who is in danger of being understood 
and followed only by crazy people." He reaffirmed [National 
Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's loyalty but enlarged on his 
ideas about Benito Mussolini. He explained the nature of the 
party or nonparty that he wants to create and described future 
posts and responsibilities. He entrusted new deputy Fabrizio 
del Noce, former foreign correspondent for television channel 1 
news, with responsibility for the very delicate media 
department. He provided answers on the question of internal 
dissent and the sudden departure of Domenico Mennitti (he may be 
replaced in the post of national coordinator by Paolo del 
Debbio). And he issued the following watchword to his colonels: 
We are ready for anything. He made it clear, with no 
circumlocutions, that "if it becomes impossible to govern, we 
will not be caught unprepared by an early election.... So much 
the worse for the others, for those who have failed to realize 
that they are playing with fire...." 
  It was a case of Forza Italia versus the Northern League. 
Was this merely electioneering? Following the attacks from 
Bossi, who described the Berlusconi movement as "a UFO with no 
ideals," Berlusconi issued a sharp response, but warned his men 
"not to reply in the same tone, in the same language. We must 
ponder long and hard before attacking them, otherwise we risk 
losing votes, like them. Of course, the debate has now fallen 
below the danger level. Yesterday evening I saw Bossi on `Milano 
Italia' and I do not know whether it is possible to continue 
with an ally who insults you on television, and then tries to 
get smart by flirting with the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] and opening up to the progressive forces, without 
consulting with anyone...." Lastly, a piece of advice to his 
deputies: "Talk with the League deputies. Make them understand 
that they were elected with your votes, which are moderate 
votes. Make them listen to reason: If they follow Bossi they 
will quickly lose their seats, sooner than they imagine...." 
  Though Bossi is a traitor, Fini "is loyal, a truly 
trustworthy ally. And we repay his loyalty. But that does not 
mean forever and unconditionally." The prime minister 
explained: "Today's alliances will not always be the same 
tomorrow...." This was a mysterious observation. Particularly 
when set alongside his brusque distancing from the 
fascism-antifascism issue. With regard to Mussolini and his 
American interview, Berlusconi explained that he "never said 
that Mussolini did some good things...partly because it is 
obvious that someone who wields total power will do both good 
things and bad things. But my thoughts lie elsewhere: Since we 
believe strongly in democracy, we want to do good things within 
democracy and certainly not under a dictatorship. Is that 
clear?" [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Pialuisa </F>
Bianco in Rome on 31 May: "Berlusconi: This Is How I Will 
Govern" -- first two paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Things got off to a bad start, because I am always 
punctual and I do not like to be kept waiting. The Palazzo 
Chigi [government seat] was unusually bereft of official cars 
and bodyguards, so I thought with irritation that the prime 
minister was out. But instead, there he was, right on time, in 
his double-breasted suit with a spotted necktie and a big smile. 
That was enough to win me over to the new incumbent. On one 
occasion, at the time of the barons of the First Republic, Paolo 
Cirino Pomicino, recently arrived at the Agriculture Ministry, 
made me wait for an hour and then proceeded to explain to me 
that power is measured by how long you can succeed in keeping 
someone waiting. 
  Bodyguards and security staff, with their red and white 
symbols of authority, have been reduced to a minimum. "This is 
the first thing I did when I reached here," Berlusconi said, 
somewhat embarrassed. "You should have seen the state I found 
this place in. You may not believe it, but among the tapestries 
and stucco work they had amassed reproduction antique furniture 
-- lamps, chairs, and tables made in Brianza. Apart from the 
lack of taste and discrimination, there was a complete neglect 
of even the external dignity and decorum of this institution." 
After another, inevitable, smile, this former businessman from 
Brianza explained: "The lack of identity of a political class is 
apparent even in small things. For instance, if the prime 
minister wants to invite a prominent figure to lunch, he has to 
ask the other ministries to provide hospitality. And to think 
that the staff and officials scattered in the various offices 
total 5,200 people -- 5,000 more than under De Gasperi. You 
know what the cross section of a tree looks like when it has 
been felled and you can see its age from the growth rings? It 
is like that in these offices: Imagine cutting a section 
through them, and you will see the stratification of the 
apparatus accumulated from government to government. [no end 
quote as published] 
  [Bianco] I know that your name is synonymous with 
efficiency, 
Prime Minister, but there were moments in Parliament when your 
face betrayed your irritation with parliamentary ceremony.... 
  [Berlusconi] There is only one thing that usually irritates 
me -- theatricality, rhetoric, pomp. But this applies both 
inside and outside Parliament. I am concerned with the things 
that need to be done. The moment I arrived at the Palazzo Chigi 
I decided to announce that the prime minister's salary would go 
to charity. Then I changed my mind, because of my horror of 
rhetoric. You can imagine: People would have said right away 
that a sacrifice of 6 million lire a month for Berlusconi was no 
sacrifice at all. 
  [Bianco] In your first parliamentary victories in a 
difficult 
Senate situation, did you succeed mainly because of your courage 
to gamble everything, or were the opposition forces left 
confused by the force of attraction exerted by the first prime 
minister, enjoying strong popular support, to believe himself 
invincible? 
  [Berlusconi] I have realized something: In Parliament there 
are no victories and defeats in pitched battles; there is a 
dialogue, a debate on the basis of different roles, and a 
majority decision that it often takes too long to reach and that 
is often reached by means of confused mechanisms. The 
confidence debate was an excellent example. Those who wanted to 
turn it into a propaganda event failed; it was ideas, programs, 
and -- if I may be permitted to say so -- the attitude of the 
government which prevailed. And not only the effect of the 
people's support. 
  [Bianco] Would you rather gain a victory or an overwhelming 
victory? 
  [Berlusconi] Good manners are for me the most important 
rule. 
But political observers find it difficult to appreciate their 
importance. You saw what an impact my shaking hands with 
Giorgio Napolitano in Parliament had. But that was merely a 
necessary gesture; I tried to explain that it was neither a 
propaganda gesture nor an attempt to secure a benevolent 
attitude. While other left-wing oppositionists were yielding to 
demagoguery and personal attacks, Mr. Napolitano was able to be 
both tough and correct. 
  [Bianco] Nevertheless, that handshake did almost more to 
create difficulties for the opposition than the adherence to the 
spoils system has.... 
  [Berlusconi] I am not trying to cause difficulties for the 
opposition. That was the favorite pursuit of the parties of the 
First Republic, which used parliament to build a new balance 
every day by dint of successive declarations.... 
  [Bianco] What is your strategy, Prime Minister? 
  [Berlusconi] It is to govern. That is all. Then the voters 
will decide. This is the essence of rotation in a 
first-past-the-post system. 
  [Bianco] A few days at the Palazzo Chigi have caused the 
coercive Berlusconi to disappear in favor of the Doroteo-style 
[reference to former Christian Democratic Party (DC) faction] 
Berlusconi.... 
  [Berlusconi] I do not feel like either. If I had to describe 
my experiment I would say: the happy mean, a liberal and 
moderate government. I am learning that there is no politics 
without patient negotiation, but if negotiations exhaust and 
enfeeble politics, then that means trouble. 
  [Bianco] Are the opposition forces right to demand at least 
a few chairmanships of parliamentary committees as a means of 
exercising institutional monitoring? 
  [Berlusconi] The issue of the parliamentary committees must 
not be exaggerated. The basic principle is that Parliament 
exercises legislative and monitoring functions, and can accept, 
amend, or reject the government's political orientation. This 
is the task of the whole of Parliament, both majority and 
minority. Parliament is an instrument of the people for 
exercising their sovereignty, not a weapon of the opposition 
forces for obstructing the government's activity. This role is 
not determined by the chairmanship of a committee. We have been 
clear with the minority -- limited political accords in an 
atmosphere of institutional courtesy and calm coexistence amid 
our differences, but no associational joint management of 
parliamentary activity. 
  [Bianco] You have learned to sound like a manual of 
parliamentary procedure, Prime Minister. 
  [Berlusconi] I like precision and I do not like to talk 
about 
things about which I know nothing. 
  [Bianco] Are the relations that you seek with the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] solely for opportunistic reasons, in 
order to increase your majority in the Senate? 
  [Berlusconi] On the contrary. The PPI is a political area 
that attracts a moderate Catholic vote, which is also part of 
our own coalition. We and they are close, whether or not that 
party's leaders like the fact. I am not trying to undermine 
anyone's position, and I do not want their party to 
disintegrate. I am seeking a serious dialogue with the PPI; I 
reject the attitudes of preconceived hostility of the old DC 
Right. 
  [Bianco] Samuelson says that even though you won such an 
overwhelming vote in the elections you "cannot do anything." 
Are you afraid of becoming the umpteenth representative of 
Italy's "nongovernment?" 
  [Berlusconi] I preferred Kissinger's assessment: The 
government must concentrate on specifics and implement its 
program proceeding from its economic part; and the disputes over 
questions of principle, the ill-intentioned and vengeful climate 
imposed by the losers -- all this will disappear faster than is 
believed. 
  [Bianco] Even Clinton, a Democrat, made the same 
recommendation, thus disappointing progressives in this country. 
  [Berlusconi] I too was surprised. I expected vaguer and more 
diplomatic remarks, with a more remote reference to our problems 
and recent history. Instead President Clinton said what he had 
to say, with a friendly and pragmatic attitude that is typical 
of the best of his country's culture and, I would say, of the 
"American spirit." I am sure that, leaving aside justifiable 
anxieties stemming from the innovations, our allies will display 
impeccable respect for our independence of judgment and support 
for the new Italy that emerged from the 27 March elections. 
  [Bianco] Yesterday a less optimistic governor of the Bank of 
Italy warned you not to lower your guard on the public spending 
front. 
  [Berlusconi] That was a strange point to make, since 
reducing 
and selecting public expenditure and lowering tax pressure have 
always been at the center of my program. 
  [Bianco] What would you do if another Crotone [location of 
major industrial dispute] were to occur? 
  [Berlusconi] I would seek a responsible and realistic 
solution, as [former Prime Minister] Ciampi tried to do. But I 
would try to ensure that its entire burden did not fall on the 
shoulders of the community as a whole or on the general interest 
in a recovery of the economy and of employment. Jobs must be 
protected by creating new ones and by stimulating development, 
not by placing constraints on state industries. 
  [Bianco] Is your decision influenced by the spreading 
propatronage attitude in the Catholic component of the majority 
or the AN's [National Alliance] "social" policy? At Crotone the 
MSI [Italian Social Movement] demonstrated together with the 
Left. 
  [Berlusconi] The suggestion that the AN is a neostatist 
party 
is one of the many myths constructed on the basis of empty talk. 
As far as I know, and in the absence of any evidence to the 
contrary, Fini and Tatarella [AN] share the government's 
approach to deregulation in the economic field. 
  [Bianco] Some 20 years ago La Malfa senior complained that 
it 
was impossible to dream of Scandinavian-style social services in 
an economy such as ours that produced one-third of the per 
capita income of those countries. Is this still so? 
  [Berlusconi] Scandinavian-style social services are perhaps 
not within our reach even now, but we can permit ourselves 
something better than we have now. 
  [Bianco] The entire political class, both Right and Left, 
who 
have left the scene, was convinced that these services should be 
administered by the state, and that the difference lay solely in 
the quality of management. Now that you are in Rome, are you 
too starting to think this way, or are you convinced that social 
services administered by the state are in themselves a source of 
waste? 
  [Berlusconi] The state owns essential services that it 
cannot 
relinquish. But who says it must administer them 
bureaucratically instead of on the basis of the criteria of 
efficiency that prevail in the private sector? The Constitution 
states that the republic guarantees certain social rights such 
as work, health, and education -- not inefficiency and neglect 
of the citizens' needs. 
  [Bianco] Now that the ministers have been changed, is it 
necessary to change the ministries and their respective 
bureaucracies? 
  [Berlusconi] I have found the public administration to be 
full of expert and responsible people. Certain procedures and 
old habits are an obstacle, but many members of the so-called 
bureaucracy were only waiting for a new wind in order to get rid 
of them. 
  [Bianco] What advice would you give to Fini? 
  [Berlusconi] The AN leader has a great opportunity to 
legitimize, definitely and unequivocally, a governmental Right 
capable of a positive attitude and a civilized and reassuring 
language, leaving the dross and the nostalgia to their proper 
fate. The country is ready for this, and Fini is too astute a 
politician to be unaware of it. All the rest -- the dispute 
over the remark that I in fact never made in my interview with 
THE WASHINGTON POST -- seems to me artificial. 
  [Bianco] Do your ministers not have a slightly guilty 
conscience, as in the case of [Interior] Minister Maroni, who 
demanded the head of the Vicenza police chief after the Nazi 
skinhead rally? 
  [Berlusconi] Maroni is a good minister and has not set a 
foot 
wrong so far. The opposition forces are full of praise for him 
because they hope to be able to set him against his government 
colleagues. These are childish tricks. Maroni seems to me a 
solid person free of vanity. 
  [Bianco] What would you like to say to [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi that you have not already told him? 
  [Berlusconi] To proceed courageously along his chosen path. 
To move on, with the League, from a phase of protest to a phase 
of government and real reform of this country. In the short 
term excesses seem to yield more, but in the long term a 
rigorous attitude and a sense of state are what pay. 
  [Bianco] Bossi says that [former League ideologue] Miglio, 
since their split, has been working for Berlusconism. 
  [Berlusconi] I respect Mr. Miglio, but I do not engage in 
underhanded tactics. Ultimately, leaving aside the bad feeling, 
convergence on a possible form of federalism will prevail over 
all the misunderstandings. 
  [Bianco] With regard to bad feeling, there has been some 
even 
in Forza Italia. What would you prefer it to be like -- a 
business party, a new mass party, an American-style 
mega-electoral committee with no apparatus? 
  [Berlusconi] A movement of public opinion, a solid but 
flexible organization that does not crystallize into a party, 
that does not become rigid; an electoral cartel that can return 
to its presence within society between one election and the 
next, maintaining constant contact with the deputy and senator 
for the constituency concerned, with the entire institutional 
system, and with the citizens, organized through the clubs. 
Forza Italia has, and must maintain, its own soul and identity; 
but we do not need too forceful an ego, we do not need a party 
that will copy the policy of the parliamentary groups and that 
of the government. I said this in Parliament. We must move on 
from government by the parties to government by the institutions. 
  [Bianco] Would you have dinner with Cacciari and Occhetto 
[Democratic Party of the Left]? 
  [Berlusconi] I consider the mayor of Venice someone who can 
reason calmly. Perhaps I could talk with him about the 
usefulness to the country of an opposition that has a very clear 
objective. Not to obstruct the incumbent government's path but 
to plan an alternative government. Perhaps we would agree on 
many things, perhaps even on the menu. 
  [Bianco] The Scalfaro issue: At the start of the Second 
Republic is it still possible for the president to be someone 
who took part in the constitution of the First Republic? 
  [Berlusconi] Why not? Renewal is never entirely confined to 
individuals. 
  [Bianco] Have you been won over by the grand old men? 
  [Berlusconi] This republic's grand old men still have 
something to teach us. For instance, Francesco Cossiga's Senate 
speech was very fine -- committed, a real challenge. 
  [Bianco] The whole of Italy knows Berlusconi's dream, but 
are 
you sure that you can achieve it? 
  [Berlusconi] It is within everyone's reach -- to work hard 
and to pursue a straight path, without fear and with humility.
