  [Text] After the recent international polemics and just 
after having held talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, the 
president [Scalfaro] has once again stressed that Italy "is 
fundamentally stable and reliable on the international scene," 
in spite of the changes which are taking place in our country 
and the "presence of new political groupings." 
  Scalfaro was addressing 125 diplomats to celebrate Republic 
Day. He repeated that Italy "has the right to be respected by 
all those who think that substance is more important than form; 
it must be more important than form."

  [Text] There is a piece of good news for the ruling 
coalition. A short time ago, Marco Taradash, a Radical Party 
deputy who ran on a Forza Italia electoral list, was elected 
chairman of the parliamentary watchdog committee on RAI. He 
obtained 22 votes, besting the challenge of the left-wing 
candidate, Mauro Paisan.

  [Text] Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio [Forza Italia] has 
responded to those members in the ruling coalition who accused 
him of having favored the opposition parties by giving the 
go-ahead to a new Senate opposition grouping. Scognamiglio said 
that he was only following the rules laid down. He spoke to 
Anna La Rosa: 
  [Begin recording] [La Rosa] Speaker, is it still possible to 
bring together the broken pieces of the ruling coalition? 
  [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to the results of the 
elections for the chairmanships of the Senate committees, then 
the results were due to the numbers and an absence of agreement 
between the ruling coalition and the opposition parties. 
Therefore, these results could not have been avoided. It does 
not seem to me that there are broken pieces of crockery in the 
ruling coalition. The ruling coalition exists and it will have 
difficulties in the Senate and this is the logic of democracy, 
and of having respect for the rules. 
  [La Rosa] Umberto Bossi has accused you of being in some way 
responsible for what happened, for having recognized this new 
grouping [Sinistra Democratica]? 
  [Scognamiglio] I do not feel responsible, in fact, I am 
happy 
to be responsible for having applied the rules. 
  [La Rosa] What can be done now? How will it be possible to 
govern? If you cannot govern the Senate, then how can you think 
of governing the country? 
  [Scognamiglio] I think that if the ruling coalition produces 
laws that are consensual and that have a consensus, then I 
believe they will navigate the Senate without any problems. 
However, if the Senate shows a willingness to place obstacles 
in the way of the ruling coalition's right to govern the 
country, then the ruling coalition will have to draw its own 
conclusions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Red Brigade Leaflets Against </F>
Scalfaro and Berlusconi in Genoa"] 
  [Text] Genoa -- Five leaflets signed by a self-styled 
"Armed Group for the Proletarian Revolution -- New Walter Alasia 
Column" were found yesterday morning in Genoa, in the 
Sampierdarena section, a stone's throw from the place where the 
Red Brigades murdered two Carabinieri, Tosa and Battaglin. 
  The leaflets contained heavy threats against President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, National 
Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini, and League leader Umberto 
Bossi. Death threats were also addressed to CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] Secretary General Bruno Trentin, 
and PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] Secretary Achille 
Occhetto. The document, which was most probably written with an 
electronic typewriter and then photocopied, is currently being 
examined by the DIGOS [Division for General Investigations and 
Special Operations]. Is it some sort of provocation? Possibly, 
but the police are not dismissing the very real possibility of a 
new terrorist flare-up. 
  The leaflets' presence in Via Rolando, in Sampierdarena, was 
reported to the police by passers-by who noticed two of the five 
leaflets affixed -- at eye level -- to the front of a house. 
The other three leaflets were glued to a paper-collecting 
container. An eye-catching five-point star was displayed on the 
upper left-hand side of the leaflets. The five-point star is 
BR's [Red Brigades] "historical" symbol on which, however, the 
outline of a submachine gun was superimposed. Around this, in a 
radiating pattern, was the "signature" of the self-styled "armed 
group." 
  According to the leaflet, it is "the oppressive and 
exploitative state structure" which justifies the resumption of 
armed struggle. This includes executing Trentin and Occhetto, 
who are accused of "collaboration with the 
counterrevolutionaries and the bosses' clique," as well as of 
"sabotaging proletarian actions." 
  The "New Walter Alasia Column" pronounces the same sentence 
on Bossi and Berlusconi, who are targeted "because they are 
enemies of the working class and of its armed organization," and 
on Fini and Scalfaro, in that they are considered adherents of 
party organizations which openly support neofascist ideology.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Massimo Teodori: "American Complex"] </F>
  [Text] The United States' and Italy's expectations for 
President Clinton's visit to Rome are all too clear. Clinton 
needs to regain the European people's confidence, shaken by the 
scandal-mongering attacks on him and disconcerted by his 
wandering strategy in foreign policy. Berlusconi needs 
ratification, from the most powerful chief of state and Italy's 
traditional reference point, of the legitimacy and solidity of 
his leadership in this new stage of the republic. Both leaders 
are seeking to enhance their image -- the American leader with a 
touching re-evocation of D-Day on the European fronts, which 50 
years ago marked the definitive supremacy of his country's role 
in the world; and the Italian leader, with a display of 
credibility on the international scene, which has hitherto 
caused him some dismay. 
  The Italian leadership class' attitude to the United States 
has always suffered from a "complex." The U.S. Administration 
has often been asked to judge and to interfere in Italian 
domestic politics by providing support to this or that political 
solution, or acknowledgment of particular balances, or perhaps 
by issuing an excommunication to the adversaries of the moment. 
For years the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the PCI 
[Italian Communist Party] used the American pretext for their 
own domestic purposes: the ruling party, in order to lead people 
to believe that it could not be replaced in the country's 
leadership because of the impending Communist threat and the 
PCI, by espousing this theory in order to strengthen 
associationism as the only possible solution within the overall 
bloc. In the same way, now we are witnessing the powerful 
resurgence of the "American complex," despite the fact that the 
international situation has changed radically since the collapse 
of the Wall and therefore that America's interest in internal 
balances in countries where there are communists has declined to 
virtually nothing. 
  This has been apparent in recent weeks. First, Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino went to extraordinary lengths in 
Washington to explain sophisticated differences between the AN 
[National Alliance], the MSI [Italian Social Movement], 
fascists, and postfascists to his opposite numbers, who were 
mainly interested in what attitude the new government intends to 
adopt to the Atlantic Alliance and who were basically 
uninterested in the internal balances of his victorious 
electoral coalition. Then came the interview on television 
channels 1 and 5 news, in which Clinton was clumsily asked 
whether he believed that Italy was moving in a "neofascist" 
direction -- a question typical of someone suffering from a 
complex and one that deserved a curt, impartial, and pragmatic 
reply: "People must be judged on what they do, not by labels." 
Last, there was Berlusconi's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST, 
with the succession of statements, denials, and attributions of 
responsibility for the verdict on fascism, which piled one 
embarrassment on top of another. 
  So the time has come for the Italian Government to realize 
once and for all that the anxious requests for internal 
political legitimization usually made to America, and especially 
to the Clinton Administration, are neither appropriate nor 
welcome. The President said so clearly across the Atlantic, and 
it has been repeated by [National] Security Adviser Anthony Lake 
and by the authoritative chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Lee Hamilton. It has been reaffirmed, with different 
points of emphasis, by a number of American figures -- Henry 
Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Lee Iacocca, and Mario Cuomo. The 
same thing was stated baldly in August 1993 -- "the Washington 
administration is very little interested in what happens in 
Italy" - by the intellectual, Edward Luttwak, whose independent 
opinion on Italy was mistaken for a destabilizing message from 
the Washington government. 
  Now Clinton will appear on our beautiful Capitoline Hill in 
Rome and expect to see welcoming crowds. We pay tribute through 
him to the history of a nation that first liberated us from 
Nazi-fascism and that then helped to halt Stalinism. 
Politicians of all persuasions must not try to burden the 
American President with tasks and responsibilities that he must 
not, and does not want to, bear. The representatives of the 
government majority must free themselves of the complex of 
needing America's approval. And let the representatives of the 
minority, who describe themselves as neo-Clintonites, spare us 
their recent zeal as converts, having long been preachers in the 
churches of anti-Americanism. 
  The close ties between Italy and the United States, under 
the 
banner of freedom, are too important to have to be used and 
abused for petty political purposes.

<F P=106> [Report by Arturo Zampaglione: "Clinton Stages Comeback in </F>
Europe -- U.S. President Lands in Europe Thinking About Home"] 
  [Text] New York -- Having reviewed the history books and 
listened to advice on how to formally address the pope, the 
[British] queen, and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, and having 
even learned a couple of words in Italian, Bill Clinton will be 
landing at Ciampino airport, near Rome, at midnight, in the 
first stage of a European "grand tour" which abounds in 
symbolism and expectations. 
  In the next eight days, he will have his first encounter 
with 
Italy's Second Republic and its protagonists, he will shuttle 
from England to France, and will take part in D-Day 
commemorations on the anniversary of the Allied landings in 
Normandy. His aims? He has a professed one, and a covert one. 
The first is to reaffirm U.S. attachment to Europe and American 
interests in promoting East-West integration on the continent so 
as to gradually absorb postcommunist Russia. However, Clinton's 
secret dream is that his official trip may signal a reversal in 
the trend of his political fortunes at home. 
  Whether right or wrong, the White House feels persecuted by 
a 
series of political mishaps which have beset it over the past 
five months. The red-light scandals denounced by Paula Jones, 
the Whitewater inquiry, the drop from 48 to 42 percent in 
popularity polls, the setback to health system reform as a 
result of the forthcoming resignation of Dan Rostenkowski, who 
was one of Clinton's key allies in Congress, the blunders in 
Bosnia, Haiti, and China -- all this has considerably weakened 
Clinton, who is now hoping that his own D-Day -- the beginning 
of reconquest -- will start in Europe. 
  Will he succeed? Of course, the trip is organized in such 
away as to highlight his "presidential" role -- and his image as 
leader of the sole superpower -- as much as possible, 
particularly in TV coverage. Starting tomorrow, we will be 
seeing him in the Quirinale [president's palace] and the 
Vatican's halls. Against the background of Campidoglio Square 
he will speak to Rome's inhabitants about the liberation of 
their city. On Friday [3 June], he will pray at the Neptune 
Cemetery, where almost 8,000 American soldiers are buried and, 
on Saturday, he will pray at the cemetery in Cambridge. He will 
dine in full dress with the other 14 heads of state from 
countries that took part in D-Day. He will sail in yacht 
Britannia together with Queen Elizabeth. He will listen to 
early morning mass on the shores of Normandy. He will speak in 
the French Parliament, and will receive an honorary degree in 
Oxford. 
  However, all these political show business events, useful as 
they may be in terms of impressing American audiences, will be 
accompanied by polemics old and new. Clinton is very much aware 
that, in the places where the rangers landed 50 years ago or 
where General Clark drove in his jeep, there are three political 
mines ready to go off and transform the trip into a fiasco. 
They are called: neofascism, abortion, and foreign policy. 
Journalists accompanying the presidential airplane will miss no 
opportunity to ask embarrassing questions, and Clinton may have 
to pay a high price for any thoughtless replies or blunders. 
"The President's mission is not an easy one," Republican Senate 
floor leader Bob Dole, who is one of Clinton's most 
uncompromising opponents, remarked in an interview with LA 
REPUBBLICA. 
  The neofascism knot will inevitably come up at the American 
President's press conference following tomorrow afternoon's 
meeting at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office]. However, 
Clinton's discussion with Berlusconi will be focusing on much 
different matters, such as preparations for the G-7 summit in 
Naples, Russia's integration into Europe, the former Yugoslavia, 
the Middle East, and Italy's plans to reform the UN Security 
Council. Clearly, the occasion represents the United States' 
first act of "approval" of the center-right government. On the 
one hand, Clinton will utter words of encouragement to 
Berlusconi, but, on the other, he will have to justify his 
support for a government that includes National Alliance among 
its members. He will presumably repeat the same arguments that 
he put forward in an interview granted to two Italian TV 
networks: "People should be judged according to what they do, 
not according to labels. Let them govern and let us see what 
they are capable of." Again tomorrow, in the Vatican, Clinton 
will try to avoid stepping on the second mine, namely the 
abortion issue. In fact, Pope John Paul II has severely 
criticized White House policy -- both at the national and 
international level -- regarding termination of pregnancies. 
  The third mine consists of foreign policy -- the Democratic 
administration's veritable Achilles' heel. Inevitably, all its 
weaknesses will be revealed during Clinton's tour. Only 
yesterday, in an article published in NEWSWEEK, Henry Kissinger, 
the guru of American foreign policy, charged the President with 
not having so far fulfilled the "global leadership vacuum which, 
should it persist, would condemn the United States to 
progressive international irrelevance." According to the former 
secretary of state, what is lacking is "a conceptual framework 
to manage the difficulties of the post-Cold War order." 
  In his talks with Berlusconi, John Major, and Mitterrand, 
Clinton will confirm Europe's importance to the United States; 
he will speak of the extraordinary opportunity opening up in the 
coming years for "the integration of a greater Europe, from 
Portugal to Russia," to which Washington intends to make its own 
contribution; he will stress the "partnership for peace" concept 
and the need for greater cooperation between Moscow and the 
European Union. However, as Kissinger noted, this is still a 
lopsided, rather incoherent European picture, which is not 
linked to a strategic view of American interests. As a result, 
a crisis such as the one in Bosnia, rather than being a bench 
test of the new European-American cooperation, has become an 
excellent example of very bad diplomacy.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf </F>
Denktas by unidentified correspondents in Nicosia on 2 
June--recorded] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you comment on the 
Turkish Cypriot side's position? 
  [Denktas] We are prepared to continue the talks if the 21 
March document is changed in accordance with the points we 
agreed upon in Vienna. We have already mentioned that and we 
reiterate our position. In fact, that was Ambassador Richard 
Boucher's question today. We gave him a positive reply. 
  [Correspondent] Has he asked whether our position is still 
valid? Why has he asked that question? Will there be a new 
development? Do the U.S. officials plan to make a new 
initiative? 
  [Denktas] He wished to be informed on our position. I do not 
know why. Nor do I know whether or not he plans to undertake an 
initiative. 
  [Correspondent] Has the UN secretary general's report not 
killed your proposal on the talks? 
  [Denktas] That is what we have said. However, they have 
interpreted the report in a different way. They have said that 
one of the alternatives calls for the maintenance of the talks. 
They have also asked whether we agree. Well, that is why we 
have conveyed a written message to Mr. Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's deputy special envoy. However, it has been 
ignored. Furthermore, we have been threatened with sanctions. 
All that has killed our document. However, the U.S. officials 
are convinced that the door is open and they have asked whether 
we still agree to hold that door open. 
  [Correspondent] Is the United States expected to undertake a 
new initiative? 
  [Denktas] I do not know. 
  [Correspondent] Can you comment on the framework of your 
contacts with Turkey? 
  [Denktas] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and the other 
Turkish 
leaders have supported us. They have issued statements on the 
unacceptable report. We welcome that state of affairs. 
Nevertheless, Turkey probably does not want us to close the 
door. We are prepared to maintain the talks if the 21 March 
document is changed in accordance with our request. 
  [Correspondent] Does a difference of opinion exist between 
the UN secretary general and the United States on that matter? 
  [Denktas] It is because of the difference of approach 
between 
Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on 
the Cyprus issue, and Gustave Feissel that talks were held in 
Vienna. We removed that difference on at least two and a half of 
the five disputed points [sentence as heard]. We asked that the 
two and a half points be included in the 21 March document. We 
stressed that we shall agree to the views on the map [on 
Varosha] and the access road, views which we rejected until that 
time, if the two and a half points are included in that 
document. The difference of opinion is between Robert Lamb, who 
represents the United States and tries to help us, and Gustave 
Feissel, not between the United States and the UN Secretariat. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, can you comment on what will 
happen at the present time? A state of uncertainty exists. 
  [Denktas] Do not worry. Continue your daily lives as you 
have in the past. We exist as the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus. We shall continue to stand on our feet and defend our 
rights. We are ready to comply if they wish to hold talks with 
us under equal conditions.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas today received separately the 
representatives of the political parties not represented in the 
coalition government and briefed them on recent developments and 
his contacts regarding the Cyprus issue. He first received the 
National Unity Party delegation headed by leader Dervis Eroglu 
and then the Communal Liberation Party delegation headed by its 
leader Mustafa Akinci. Denktas later received the Free 
Democratic Party delegation headed by Ismet Kotak, the 
Nationalist Justice Party delegation headed by Zorlu Tore and 
the Unity and Sovereignty Party delegation headed by Arif Salih 
Kirda. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Eroglu said that the 
president briefed them on the recent developments. Pointing out 
that it is a mistake to accept the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] package, Eroglu noted that his party has opposed the 
CBM's from the very beginning, adding that the Cyprus problem 
should be solved in its entirety. Claiming that the CBM package 
has been eliminated, Eroglu said that solutions directed toward 
the essence of the problem should be sought. Noting that the UN 
secretary general should try and bring the two sides together 
instead of putting forward proposals, Eroglu said that if a 
solution is sought to the Cyprus problem based on where it was 
in 1992 then the NUP will oppose it. Pointing out that the 
talks should be based on the existence of two states, Eroglu 
referred to the UN secretary general's report saying that it 
should seek a solution taking into consideration the views of 
the people living in Cyprus and not those of the secretary 
general himself. Noting that the Turkish Cypriot political 
parties should clearly express their wishes, Eroglu added that 
everything should be discussed from the very beginning. 
  Akinci drew attention to the fact that the meeting with the 
president was held soon after the UN secretary general's report 
was announced adding that such contacts should be held before 
everything is concluded. Akinci said that they got the 
impression that the report accused the Turkish Cypriot side and 
added that currently the rights of the Turkish Cypriot side are 
being abused. He added that this report shows that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has not been successful in explaining its just 
cause in the international field. Pointing out that the thing 
to be done now is to achieve a communal conciliation, Akinci 
added that only then can one meet on an international platform 
to plan the future. Akinci concluded by saying that one cannot 
defend a just cause through an intransigent attitude and that 
everything is not over yet.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers issued a written statement 
noting that the report UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
submitted to the Security Council makes it harder for an 
agreement to be reached regarding the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's] and in establishing an atmosphere of trust 
between the two communities. The Council of Ministers assessed 
Butrus-Ghali's report during its meeting today. 
  The statement issued after the meeting states that the 
Council of Ministers share President Rauf Denktas' views 
concerning the report and sincerely hopes a realistic and viable 
solution acceptable to both sides will be reached in Cyprus. 
  Noting that the secretary general's Cyprus report makes it 
harder to reach an agreement on the CBM's as well as making it 
harder for an atmosphere of trust to be established between the 
two communities, the statement points out that the Greek Cypriot 
position is presented as that of the United Nations. The 
statement further remarks that the report is written in a manner 
which condemns the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC] 
position inspite of the TRNC's show of goodwill and constructive 
stand. 
  The statement notes that the Council of Ministers believes 
that approaches of this kind -- be it in the form of CBM's or be 
it in the form of a comprehensive agreement -- will not achieve 
a solution and continues: Undoubtedly, no solutions can be 
reached when views, acceptable to one side on condition and not 
even approved by the other side, are coerced to one of the sides. 
  It was also stressed in the statement that Denktas supports 
and endorses the favorable and constructive views he 
communicated to Gustave Feissel, UN secretary general's deputy 
special envoy in Cyprus, yesterday.

    [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on 2 June 
carry commentaries on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
report to the Security Council on the outcome of negotiations on 
the confidence-building measures which was released 1 June. 
  Pro-Democratic Rally ALITHIA carries a 650-word commentary 
on 
page one entitled, "Implementing the Butrus-Ghali Report," which 
the writer describes as satisfactory in its description of 
events. However, the writer notes: "The second part of 
Butrus-Ghali's report with the five alternatives he suggests to 
the Security Council may not be considered a dramatic cure with 
radical (depending on the seriousness of the interpretation) 
measures, but it is a prescription based on the recognition of 
the other side's responsibility for the impasse." The writer 
discusses the first option, which is the withdrawal of the 
United Nations from Cyprus, and notes that this would be unfair 
for the weaker side, the Greek Cypriot side. He adds: "The UN 
secretary general's alternatives may not be absolutely 
satisfactory, but they offer our side the possibility to demand 
safety and security in accordance with the principles of 
international law and the UN Charter. Besides the fact that 
Butrus-Ghali suggests alternatives, he leaves no doubt as to 
which can be implemented and productive. At the same time, he 
does not avoid the extreme suggestion of exerting pressure on 
the other side by taking steps so that it will accept the 
confidence-building measures." The writer concludes: "The most 
positive aspect of the report is that it condemns the other 
side's firm negative stance. It objectively describes reality 
and makes the Security Council aware of its responsibilities. 
It is a report on wise use and not irresponsible rejection." 
  The conservative, nationalist I SIMERINI carries a 700-word 
editorial on page one entitled, "Disengagement Now" in which the 
writer says that following a "scandalous" tolerance toward 
Denktas, the UN secretary general was "forced" to blame the 
Turkish side for the impasse. The writer says: "Expressions 
like, `the situation is not satisfactory,' `there is no 
political will for a solution,' and `we should search for new 
processes,' muddies the waters and actually attributes blame 
where it does and does not belong. The blame for the outcome of 
the latest negotiating effort is placed on Denktas, but there is 
an attempt to create the impression that everyone is responsible 
since, for 30 years `it has been proven that there is no 
political will for a solution.' The UN secretary general 
proposed five alternatives on which the Security Council is 
called upon to decide. The very first `option' is a punishment 
for the victim, which is the Greek Cypriot side!" The writer 
says that this is not a new proposal but one that first came to 
light two years ago, and concludes: "If there is time and 
willingness to muddle along and make a new mockery, it does not 
depend on us. Because, let us not kid ourselves, the backstage 
now promotes a `new beginning' with another framework and pseudo 
names for the same things, and with new deadlines and new 
wishful promises. Anyone who wants to can get tangled deeper by 
assuming political and historical responsibility." 
  The independent O AGON carries a 300-word commentary on page 
four entitled, "The Post-Report Period." The writer says that 
following the long-awaited report, everyone now wonders what 
will happen with the secretary general's suggestions. The 
writer says: "Unfortunately, the placement of blame on the 
Turkish Cypriot side is not accompanied with clear views on how 
to bend Denktas' intransigence. The five options for 
alternative actions submitted by Butrus-Ghali cannot be 
considered positive because they either turn against our side 
(withdrawal of UNFICYP, UN Forces in Cyprus) or limit the Cyprus 
issue to the confidence-building measures and a plan." The 
writer concludes with the following: "We want to believe that 
our side will not waste time in a never-ending discussion over 
the positive and negative points of the Butrus-Ghali report. We 
want to believe that this time with what we have learned from 
the process we will enact a policy different from the ones that 
only lead us to `descriptive reports.'" 
  KHARAVYI, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party AKEL, 
carries 
its commentary in the 400-word "Controversy" column by "Arkanis" 
(pseudo name for the writer) on page one under the headline, "A 
First Evaluation." The writer says the UN secretary general's 
report justifies AKEL's positions and dissolves the Kliridhis 
Government's illusions about alternative plans of action. He 
adds: "The most substantive part of the UN secretary general's 
report is the one that talks about how to proceed. This part of 
the report is also dissatisfying because, despite the fact that 
it stresses the Turkish intransigence, the five points of the 
Butrus-Ghali proposals to the Security Council on how to proceed 
are not the ones that our side would have liked." He says: 
"The UN secretary general's report justifies AKEL's position 
for return to the substance of the Cyprus issue based on a plan 
and map, and the implementation of alternative actions that will 
force the Turkish side to withdraw its unacceptable conditions 
on substance and adjusts its positions based on the Butrus-Ghali 
proposals." The writer concludes: "Unfortunately for our side, 
the developments fully justify the positions of AKEL. Perhaps 
the direction of developments could have been different if 
AKEL's views and suggestions regarding Security Council 
Resolution 789 were taken into consideration and not destroyed 
to serve election expediencies. The way out of today's situation 
is offered only through our proposal for a return to the 
substance of the Cyprus issue."

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Kallinikou] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nicosia and Athens yesterday expressed 
satisfaction with the contents of the UN secretary general's 
report to the Security Council, whereas [Turkish Cypriot Leader] 
Rauf Denktas launched an attack against Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
Most Cypriot political parties also expressed satisfaction with 
the fact that the report very clearly blames the impasse on the 
Turkish side and that, for the first time, the Turkish side's 
lack of political will has been recorded. However, AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People] expressed concern and 
the Free Democrats Movement [former President Yeoryios 
Vasiliou's party] expressed the view that...the Turkish side has 
been reinforced. [passage omitted] 
  AKEL General Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he 
does not believe that we should be happy with the report because 
the secretary general admits that the package of 
confidence-building measures is clearly in favor of the Turkish 
Cypriot side and that among the alternative actions more weight 
is given to the option of continuing the discussion of the 
confidence-building measures, even though the report refers to 
taking strong measures against Denktas. Khristofias said: "We 
would combine the discussion of the substance of the Cyprus 
issue with the assumption of practical and strong measures, 
which would force Denktas and Turkey to discuss the substance of 
the issue on the basis of UN resolutions." He also added that 
no one has the right to celebrate about anything. 
  DIKO [Democratic Party] Chairman Spiros Kiprianou said: "At 
first glance, it is evident that the UN secretary general's 
report clearly blames the lack of agreement on the 
confidence-building measures on the Turkish Cypriot side. He 
says that there is no political will, but he does not mention 
Turkey clearly. He should have had the courage to name Turkey. 
He also refers to others in the region who do not have the 
political will. I want to believe that he implies Turkey, and 
not anyone else." Kiprianou also stressed the need to remind 
the international community that the Cyprus issue is a problem 
of invasion, occupation, settlement, and violation of human 
rights. 
  EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] Vice Chairman Takis 
Khatzidhimitriou stressed that the report does include, at least 
theoretically, the possibility for measures to be taken against 
Denktas. Khatzidhimitriou said that in his report the secretary 
general appears, even if only a little, to imply that Turkey 
does not have the political will for a solution to the Cyprus 
problem. For the first time, he said, there is also a reference 
to measures, something we are not used to hearing from the 
secretary general. He added that the report is lenient but the 
reference to possibilities that could be used in the future 
gives our side the opportunity to assume initiatives. 
  Liberal Party Chairman Nikolaos Rolandhis described the UN 
secretary general's report as exquisite. He said: "In his 
report, the secretary general stressed his clear concern for 
Cyprus and the lack of progress on the problem. The worst 
alternative for our side is the withdrawal of the United Nations 
from Cyprus as a peacekeeping force and as a political presence; 
the second worst alternative is to return to Butrus-Ghali's set 
of concepts; the third worst is to continue with the 
confidence-building measures and some other plan, including an 
idea to take measures against the Turkish Cypriots. It is clear 
that if President Glavkos Kliridhis had not followed the policy 
he did our position now would have been difficult, and I think 
that the only alternative now would have been for the United 
Nations to withdraw from Cyprus." 
  Free Democrats Chairman Yeoryios Vasiliou described the 
report as objective. However, he added that the report shows 
how big a mistake it was to get involved in the dialogue on the 
confidence- building measures. Vasiliou said: "The report is 
objective, but it does not give anyone the right to celebrate. 
On the contrary, it shows how big a mistake it was to begin 
these negotiations on the confidence-building measures and how, 
as a result of these negotiations, the Turkish Cypriot side has 
been reinforced and our side has become weaker." 
  Finally, ADISOK [Democratic Socialist Renewal Movement] 
Chairman Mikhail Papapetrou expressed satisfaction with the 
report because it clearly blames the Turkish side for the 
impasse and states that the lack of political will by the 
Turkish side systematically blocks all the efforts for a 
solution to the Cyprus problem. In addition, he said, for the 
first time the report mentions measures to pressure the Turkish 
side. Furthermore, Papapetrou said that the UN secretary 
general's report creates future prospects for the issue and also 
confirms the correctness of the political forces that have 
supported the confidence-building measures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], and specifically the appeal against Greece at 
the European Court on 14 June for the embargo against Skopje, is 
not on the agenda of the EU [European Union] Summit in Corfu. 
This was stated today by Government Spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos, who clarified that from the moment the EU Commission 
chose to deal with the issue as a legal one, it has lost its 
political character. As a result, he said, it does not relate 
to the EU Summit. 
  Matthew Nimetz, U.S. special envoy on the Skopje issue, will 
come to Athens next week for contacts with the foreign 
ministry's political leadership.

  [Text] President Konstandinos Karamanlis today said that 
what happens in relations among states can not be explained 
logically, as these relations are ruled by absurdity and 
anarchy. The president said an example of the above is the 
Greek-Albanian relations which are ruled by absurdity. 
  Furthermore, the president refused to comment on the 
elections for the European Parliament, citing his office, but he 
indirectly advised fewer statements. He said that he prefers to 
remain quiet when everybody else is talking.

<F P=106> [Article by Takis Dhiamandis from Tirana] </F>
  [Text] Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi insisted to 
a lawyer that Greek minority members were not arrested in 
Albania but were merely summoned as witnesses. 
  The lawyer was Greek Ambassador to Albania Khristos 
Tsalikis, 
who was summoned to the Albanian Foreign Ministry the day before 
yesterday for "briefing" purposes. The German, French, Italian, 
British, U.S., Chinese, and Russian ambassadors were also 
briefed. 
  The Greek ambassador, who is not accustomed to remaining 
silent, told Serreqi: "Mr. Minister, I am a lawyer myself and 
you will never convince me that anywhere in the world witnesses 
are summoned with a strong police force and cages." 
  Commenting on Serreqi's statement that Athens cut off the 
Greek-Albanian dialogue, Tsalikis reminded him that the Greek 
side suggested a meeting between the two countries at the level 
of experts, which the Albanian side rejected. 
  Replying to a remark by the Albanian minister that Greece 
was 
wrong to block European financial aid to Albania by taking 
advantage of its European Union [EU] presidency, the Greek 
ambassador said Greece had no reason to take advantage of the 
presidency but only made a suggestion as an EU member. All EU 
partners agreed with this suggestion... [ellipsis as published] 
  What did Serreqi, who as a pediatrician has no obligation to 
know law or diplomacy, understand about this? The only one who 
is in a position to know is Albanian President Sali Berisha, who 
was briefed by the Albanian foreign minister yesterday morning.

<F P=106> [Report by Yeoryios Marnellos] </F>
  [Excerpts] Cooperation between the antiterrorist services 
and U.S. teams participating in the efforts to dismantle the 17 
November terrorist organization will be changing. 
  The change in status for cooperation with the Americans is 
one of the three parts included in the reorganization of the 
Antiterrorist Service (IAEV) [expansion unknown]. 
  According to a police source, Greek authorities were not 
satisfied with the cooperation with the Americans because they 
were only taking information without providing any. Thus, the 
Greek officers often felt like investigative employees for the 
Americans, who continued their investigations after every 
terrorist action without providing any information. 
  Of course, the cooperation with the Americans will not be 
suspended, but there will be an effort to become equal. The 
Greek authorities need U.S. assistance, in means and 
information, which until now has not been sufficient. 
  The issue of equal cooperation was raised by Minister of 
Public Order Stilianos Papathemelis during his visit to the 
United States two months ago. He received assurances that the 
cooperation would be improved. 
  The other two parts of the reorganization provide for the 
establishment of a group of 15 to 20 scientists with various 
specialties, who will be advising the director of the 
antiterrorist staff, and for more flexible operations of the 
existing four departments of the service. 
  The scientific staff, in English called a think-tank 
(reservoir of thought) will be manned by experts who specialize 
in analyzing leaflets, economists, sociologists, electronic 
translators, and analysts of information from foreign and local 
publications, and so forth. [passage omitted] 
  The third and last part of the reorganization aims at 
disengaging those serving in inactive departments of the 
antiterrorist unit and greater coherence and flexibility among 
the four departments of the antiterrorist service. The service 
is expected to operate in its new form by the summer, while any 
pertinent decisions [not specified] are expected to be announced 
officially in the next few days.

  [Text] Twenty-five new AIDS cases were found in Greece in 
the last three months, which raises the total number since 1984 
to 916. There are an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 carriers of the 
AIDS virus. Our correspondent has the following report: 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] Twenty-five new AIDS cases were 
discovered in Greece during the last three months, raising the 
total number of cases since 1984 to 916. At the same time, the 
carriers of the AIDS virus are estimated to number from 13,000 
to 15,000. Of the 916 cases, 801 are men, 55 women, and 20 
children. Already 354 of those infected with the virus have 
died. 
  Health Minister Dhimitrios Kremastinos, who held a news 
conference in the framework of an AIDS seminar organized by the 
Center for the Control of Special Infections at PARTET [not 
further identified] Institute, stressed that Greece still has 
the fewest cases in Europe. However, this does not justify 
relaxation, since the disease is progressing in other countries 
and preventive measures should be intensified. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Istanbul, June 2 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman said today that the straits regulations 
which Turkey will implement on July 1st, was under the 
authorization of Turkey. 
  `It is not possible to throw a city of 10 million into 
danger,' Ataman said. 
  Ataman stressed that the regulations were put into force 
solely on security and environmental considerations and this 
document was not, in any way, conflicting the Montreux 
Convention, which regulates passage through the straits. 
  He added that the issue was elaborately reviewed together 
with Russia. 
  Ataman recalled that the International Maritime Organization 
had approved Turkey's regulations. 
  Greece supported Russia in its oppossition to Turkey's 
straits regulations which will become effective July 1st. 
  Turkey last week adopted a new set of regulations for 
maritime passage through the straits in order to prevent 
accidents, and to safeguard security and protection of its 
citizens as well as the environment along the Bosporus, the 
Marmara Sea and the Dardanelles. 
  According to the new regulations, ships carrying dangerous 
material and chemicals will have to warn authorities 24 hours 
before their passage, and no other similar ship will be allowed 
into the Bosporus before the previous one exits. 
  Ships will have to sail by following `the report system, 
traffic control centers and stations, traffic diversion scheme' 
which is one of the main items of the regulations. 
  Also according to the regulations the straits can be 
temporarily closed in case of construction, fire fighting, 
sounding, scientific and sports activities, rescue operations 
and the prevention of sea pollution. 
  It is also forbidden to sail the straits with sailboats, row 
boats and swimming and hunting are also prohibited. 
  On March 13, 30 seamen died on the Bosporus when Greek 
flagged tanker Nassia collided with another Greek freighter. 
  The accident also interrupted the traffic on the 18-mile 
(30-km) strait and led to environmental hazards.

  [Text] Bulent Ecevit, Democratic Left Party leader, said 
that Turkey must close the Cyprus file and immediately start the 
process of establishing autonous relations with the Turkish 
Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. 
  At a news conference in parliament, Ecevit charged that 
instead of reconciling the two sides, the UN secretary general 
is trying to prevent that from happening. In this way, Ecevit 
said, the process of making the Greek Cypriot Republic a member 
of the European Union will be started. 
  Ecevit pointed out that in this process, the Turkish Cypriot 
sector will be considered a part of the Greek Cypriot Republic. 
In the end, he warned, the Turkish Cypriots will be handed over 
to the Greek Cypriots and Cyprus will be attached to Greece de 
facto. This plot must be undone, he stressed. 
  [Begin Ecevit recording] On the condition that the Turkish 
Cypriots agree, the TRNC must be an autonomous state completely 
independent in its domestic affairs, and attached to Turkey only 
in foreign security and international relations. There are two 
island states that are attached to Britain with such autonomous 
relations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Semih D. Idiz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's remarks on 
Friday in Boston to the effect that Ankara could reject U.S. 
military aid for 1995 if this is made contingent on "progress in 
human rights in Turkey" as well as "progress in the Cyprus 
talks," has undoubted appeal for Turks from both the left- and 
the right-wing of the political spectrum. 
  Ciller was responding to a decision last week by the U.S. 
House of Representatives to cut the amount of assistance to 
Turkey proposed by the administration and to attach the 
"progress on human rights and Cyprus" conditions on 25 percent 
of the figure that was eventually authorized. That figure, in 
this case, is around $360 million, the bulk of which is due to 
be extended as a low interest loan. Ciller told reporters she 
had informed President Bill Clinton over the phone of the 
displeasure with which Turks view the House's decision and also 
that Turkey could reject the "aid" if the House's decision was 
upheld by the Senate and endorsed by the administration. 
  "Shouldn't we fight against terrorism? Is this what they 
(the 
U.S. Congress) want?" Ciller was quoted from Boston as saying 
concerning the "human rights" stipulation of the House of 
Representatives. 
  She was indirectly referring to the fact that for the House, 
"human rights" as such, appears to be synonymous today with 
Turkey's "Kurdish problem," and its fight in combating the 
separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). More than one Turk 
today is questioning whether it is worth "demeaning national 
pride" by submitting to such conditions for these amounts of 
money. 
  Especially now that "Turkey can easily secure such amounts 
of 
money from other sources." 
  As it is, "looking to America's hands" for such aid has more 
often than not been considered "humiliating" for ordinary Turks 
to begin with. 
  In this respect it is not difficult to understand the 
political logic behind Ciller's remarks because, "standing up to 
America" and "refusing its gifts" inevitably goes down well, not 
just with the masses but also with elements of the 
intelligentsia whether they be leftish, rightish or pro-Islamic. 
All this said, however, it is not difficult to imagine the 
shudders of initial surprise, followed by discontent, among 
members of the Turkish civilian and military establishment at 
these remarks by the prime minister. 
  Rumors filtering thought the political grapevine in Ankara 
have it that even President Suleyman Demirel has found Ciller's 
remarks "quixotic" and "excessive." 
  Demirel is said to be concerned that the prime minister's 
remarks risk stoking up the latent "anti-Americanism" which is 
never far from the surface in the Turkish political psyche. 
  It is likely that for all their anger with the House's 
decision, Turkish diplomats will also have been taken aback by 
Ciller's announcement and have found her action to be "not 
helpful" in efforts to settle the problem by diplomatic means. 
Their desire to this effect was already apparent in the way 
that foreign ministry spokesmen have been reluctant to commit 
themselves to the notion that Turkey might refuse U.S. aid. 
When pressed by reporters to answer questions on the issue, 
these spokesmen have often merely said that all options were 
"open to consideration." 
  Analysts point to the fact that this latest development 
vis-a-vis the U.S. House of Representatives is not without 
precedent, and recall that Turkey was the butt of such 
developments throughout the 1980's. 
  They remind us that all this gave Turkey experience in 
"managing Washington" through the various executive and 
legislative branches. 
  They say that the bill which passed the house has still to 
go 
through the Senate, and it is very likely it will go to a 
conference committee from there in order to find a compromise 
between the house and the senate versions of the bill. The 
implication in this is that there is still room for Turkey to 
maneuver and influence its position through its lobby in 
Washington before the U.S. aid bill takes on its final form. 
Analysts in close contact with official circles in Ankara, for 
their part, indicate that the deepest concern over the broad 
implications of Ciller's suggestion that U.S. aid may be refused 
can be expected from Turkey's "military wing." 
  Always very displeased with any cutbacks in their funds, the 
military is expected also to consider what effect a refusal of 
U.S. aid may do to prospects concerning the aid that is received 
"in kind," and not in cash. 
  The bottom line in all this is that most analysts in fact 
believe Prime Minister Ciller's remarks represent no more than a 
"dabbling in populism." They claim that she eventually will 
have to "swallow her words" as she has in the recent past 
concerning such other issues of great popular appeal in Turkey 
as the question of Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that, as 
planned, the government is step by step approaching the 
conclusion the nation is yearning for in the struggle against 
terrorism. Ciller addressed her party's assembly group meeting 
today. 
  In her statement, Ciller reported that the organization's 
balance has been totally upset as a result of the blows dealt to 
the bandits both inside and outside the country in a planned, 
systematic, and determined manner. The initiative has been 
placed in the hands of the state forces at every point, Ciller 
announced, stressing that the separatists, who suffered a 
significant loss of personnel, are in a state of moral collapse. 
Under these circumstances, Ciller explained, there has been a 
300 percent increase in the number of terrorists fleeing the 
organization or surrendering to the security forces of their own 
free will. She remarked that the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] has totally lost the people's support and is 
therefore trying to recruit militants by the use of force and 
violence. 
  Pointing out that the terrorists are trying not to engage in 
large-scale clashes with the security forces that will result in 
heavy losses, the prime minister said that it was learned that 
heavy pressure is being applied and horrible executions are 
taking place within the organization in a bid to prevent 
desertions. Ciller revealed that the terrorist organization's 
logistics support and warehouses of provisions have largely been 
destroyed. 
  Ciller announced that the developments in northern Iraq, 
which are very important for Turkey's national security, are 
also being followed carefully. All necessary steps and measures 
are being taken to prevent events from taking a turn that may 
threaten Turkey's interests, Ciller stated. Noting that there 
is full agreement and cooperation with Iran concerning the 
antiterror struggle, the prime minister disclosed that there are 
signs that certain neighboring countries are still supporting 
terrorism. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I want to clearly say the following 
to them: You reap what you sow. I especially recommend that 
they learn this Turkish proverb. Furthermore, I remind them 
that such behavior does not comply with the concept of a serious 
and honorable state. [end recording] 
  In the 270 terrorist incidents that occurred over the past 
two weeks, Ciller explained, 314 terrorists were killed and 122 
terrorists were caught, while only 50 members of the security 
forces were martyred. She underlined that it is evident that 
the past 10-month period yielded more effective results than the 
past 10 years. 
  Ciller explained that the bandits urged innocent 
Kurdish-origin citizens to immigrate to northern Iraq by the use 
of force and various lies and they now wish to use this as a 
means of propaganda against Turkey at the United Nations and in 
world public opinion. In this way, Ciller noted, the bandits 
are trying to bring foreign political pressure to stop the 
operations in the region and to secure safe havens for 
themselves. 
  The prime minister announced that the PKK, which is 
beginning 
to crumble inside the country, has adopted the strategy pursued 
by ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in 
the past, of dragging the struggle into the international arena 
and onto a human rights level. Ciller recalled, however, that 
all the citizens in Turkey are equal and this is guaranteed by 
the Constitution and the laws. Pointing out that the citizens, 
who were forced at gunpoint to immigrate to northern Iraq, are 
now hungry and destitute, Ciller continued: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on these citizens not 
be instrumental in the plots of the terrorist organization, not 
to succumb to it, and to immediately return to their motherland 
and homes. I hope that everyone will note and understand that 
the terrorists' real goals are not related to the interests of 
the regional population and that the organization itself is a 
tool in the hands of known foreign centers. A large group of 
youths -- mostly mere children -- who have been instigated into 
undertaking terrorist acts against their state and who have been 
driven to the mountains by a handful of traitors -- who are 
leading a safe and luxurious life abroad -- are not actually 
aware of who and what goal they are serving. 
  I would like to remind them once again that they have only 
two options and no other ways out. I say to them: Come and 
surrender to the compassionate hands of the state. We will 
treat you with the compassion of a state and a mother. You 
either opt for this alternative, or we will end up with youths 
who will die in security force operations with the stamp of 
traitor on their foreheads. I genuinely feel the compassion and 
sorrow of a mother. I am again calling on all our youths. I am 
again appealing on all the mothers and fathers: Let us embrace 
our children. Let us together prevent them from pursuing a 
dead-end road. [end recording] 
  Ciller emphasized that, as promised, this matter will 
definitely be concluded before 1995. She also reported that the 
National Security Council decision recommending the extension of 
the state of emergency -- currently in force in 10 provinces -- 
for another four months as of 19 July will be submitted to the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly after being assessed by the 
Council of Ministers.

<F P=106> [Column by Sedat Ergin: "Turkey Must Reprimand </F>
Butrus-Ghali" -- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] A strange situation emerged in the Vienna talks on 
Cyprus two weeks ago. The talks were held in accordance with 
the initiative that was made by Ambassador Robert Lamb, the U.S. 
State Department special coordinator on Cyprus. Fearing the 
possibility of an impasse in the talks, the U.S. diplomats 
organized a meeting between the Turkish, Turkish Cypriot, and UN 
officials in Vienna. 
  Many of the points in the UN "miniagreement package" on 
Maras 
[Varosha], dated 21 March, which caused uneasiness in the 
Turkish Cypriot side, were resolved through Robert Lamb's 
proposals in that city. But then the problem emerged. The UN 
and U.S. officials failed to put in writing the formula on which 
the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] agreed. They 
informed the Turkish Cypriot side as follows: "The 
understanding reached in Vienna will be taken into consideration 
in the talks if you agree to the UN package dated 21 March." 
  No one must expect TRNC President Rauf Denktas to adopt a 
naive approach and say "yes" to unwritten, nonbinding, and 
abstract promises. 
  Denktas visited Turkey after he returned to north Cyprus 
from 
Vienna. Regardless of the suggestions made in Ankara, he 
refused to agree to the package, dated 21 March, that is, not 
until the Vienna accord was regarded as a binding document. 
That was why Prime Minister Tansu Ciller sent Ambassador Tugay 
Ulucevik, Turkey's number one expert on the Cyprus problem, to 
the TRNC. 
  A compromise formula was agreed on by Ankara and Denktas 
through Ulucevik's initiatives in Nicosia two days ago. And 
Denktas disclosed that he agreed to the minipackage, provided 
that "the Vienna accord is included in the text of the 
agreement." He explained his new position in writing to Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative, during the dinner he had with him the night 
before last. 
  Undoubtedly, Denktas can be criticized to a certain extent 
on 
this point. It would have been more appropriate for him to make 
that disclosure, on which Turkey insisted, while he was still in 
Ankara at the beginning of the week. 
  Nevertheless, the disclosure was made. What was strange at 
this time was the UN General Secretariat's approach. UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali submitted his report to 
the UN Security Council in New York nearly two hours after 
Feissel put Denktas' letter in his pocket and bid him farewell 
in Nicosia. It is common knowledge that Butrus-Ghali's report 
accused the Turkish Cypriot side of maintaining an 
irreconcilable approach. Butrus-Ghali's behavior indicated that 
he ignored Denktas' important step. He hinted in his report 
that Denktas does not have the political will to resolve the 
problem by saying: "I am doubtful as to whether the Turkish 
Cypriot leaders will be willing to reach an agreement even if 
the changes that have been asked for by the Turkish Cypriot side 
are realized." 
  Not satisfied with that, Butrus-Ghali proposed "sanctions" 
against the Turkish Cypriot side to force it to agree to solve 
the problem. In other words, he urged the UN Security Council 
to penalize the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Regardless of how the situation is considered, 
Butrus-Ghali's 
report has revealed that he maintains an unfair and biased 
approach, which has further complicated the solution to the 
problem. Considering the concession Denktas made the night 
before last, Butrus-Ghali should have withheld or, at least, 
changed his report. Obviously, Denktas' disclosure created a new 
opportunity in the negotiations process, regardless of the fact 
that it was conditional. The proverb that comes to mind in 
light of all that is as follows: "Do we wish to acquire grapes 
or beat up the vintner?" 
  Obviously, Butrus-Ghali does not intend to facilitate the 
solution of the problem. On the contrary, he wishes to 
reprimand the Turkish Cypriot side. The initiatives he has made 
on several problems, including the situation in Bosnia, have 
failed. Consequently, he has decided to take action against the 
TRNC leaders in the Cyprus problem in order to strengthen his 
morale. 
  The Turkish diplomats were expected to obstruct 
Butrus-Ghali's report. That has not been done. Therefore, they 
should, at least, expose Butrus-Ghali's biased approach in the 
UN Security Council. Sanctions should also be taken against the 
UN secretary general for the mistakes he makes. The conflicting 
UN and U.S. approach on the problem is a good opportunity for 
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in that regard. 
  Butrus-Ghali's report indicates that he preferres a scolding 
approach instead of heeding the norms of diplomacy. Undoubtedly, 
Turkey is influential and capable enough to react in a similar 
way. Let us wait and watch developments.

  [Text] Ankara/Diyarbakir -- Pro-Kurdish sources in Turkey 
are denying government assertions that the mass migration of 
villagers from parts of southeast Anatolia to northern Iraq is a 
ploy by the outlawed Workers Party Kurdistan (PKK) aimed at 
embarrassing Turkey in the West. 
  Referring to the migration of Kurdish villagers, first 
brought to public attention earlier this month and which some 
sources claim has been going on for months, Salim Sakik, deputy 
for Sirnak from the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP), said on 
Thursday [26 May] that government allegations on this subject 
were false. Addressing Parliament Sakik said that he had 
personally talked to people leaving for Northern Iraq and 
concluded that they were being forced out of their villages by 
special security forces operating in the region and by 
government armed village guards. Sakik said these people 
numbered around 13,000 and had to be helped. 
  He asked for a Parliamentary delegation to be sent to the 
region to investigate the matter first-hand and to report back 
on its findings. 
  Responding to the charges levelled by Sakik, Minister for 
Interior Nahit Mentese repeated to Parliament his government's 
view that the whole thing was "a new tactical move by the PKK." 
  "The PKK has induced these people to go to Northern Iraq by 
making various promises to them" Mentese said, going on to 
indicate that the Turkish security forces were in the region to 
protect innocent citizens. 
  Referring to the fight against the PKK Mentese added that 
the 
"state was in a condition of self defense" in the region. 
Mentese also pointed to the fact that Sakik had not condemned 
the PKK for its recent attacks during which innocent women and 
children were among those killed. 
  He repeated that the Turkish security forces were trying to 
protect these people and recalled that the government had called 
on those who had migrated to return to their country and their 
homes. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told reporters 
yesterday that talks had been held in Geneva with U.N. officials 
about the subject of the migration of villagers from southeast 
Anatolia to northern Iraq. 
  Ataman refrained from elaborating on this further but merely 
repeated Ankara's contention that the migration was a "PKK ploy." 
  He also said that these people should not be considered as 
refugees. 
  Kurdish sources in Diyarbakir have told the Turkish Daily 
News [TDN] that the migration was taking place because local 
people had been caught between the PKK and the security forces 
in what is becoming an increasingly acrimonious and violent war. 
One of those who has decided to migrate to northern Iraq, 
Abdullah Yilmaz, the DEP candidate for mayor of Uludere in the 
March local elections, claimed people had decided to flee from 
his region because of pressure from the government-appointed 
local prefect and from the regional security chief. 
  "There is a war raging on between Turkey and the PKK and it 
is the civilian population which is being harmed in this war. 
Many villages have been totally evacuated as a result," Yilmaz 
said. He added that after he had given up his candidacy for 
mayor of Uludere he had been subjected to great pressure from 
local officials including "being dragged around the streets." 
Indicating that such behaviour by the authorities had been 
instrumental in causing people to flee their homes for northern 
Iraq, Yilmaz said that around 6,000 had left from 14 villages in 
the Uludere region alone because some of these villages had been 
forcefully evacuated by the security forces and others bombed by 
them. 
  Speaking to the TDN in the Bihere region Yilmaz said the 
main 
blame for the mass migration rested with the Turkish Security 
forces. 
  "The state is pressuring us in every way possible. The PKK 
is not pressuring us. We came here to get away from it all but 
they are still firing artillery shells on us. Planes are flying 
over our heads. We are being subjected to inhuman behaviour. 
Our children are afraid. We can not make our voices heard in 
the world. If international organizations do not take this 
matter in hand many people will die" Yilmaz said. 
  Other sources said that recent village evacuations had been 
concentrated in the Diyarbakir and Bingol regions. They named 
Diyarbakir's counties of Kulp and Lica and Bingol's county of 
Genc as examples. 
  The sources said that these regions were the scenes of 
intense military activity over the past month and claimed that 
special security forces were engaging in operations against 
villages in the region in conjunction with bombing of these 
villages. Other counties attached to Diyarbakir, such as Hani, 
Dicle and Silvan have started to be targeted in the past few 
days in the same way, these sources claimed. 
  Meanwhile some sources are saying that the exodus into 
northern Iraq is much greater that the figures quoted to date 
and indicate that up to 30,000 people may be involved. 
According to some accounts reaching Ankara, villagers from 
Hakkari's Cukurca region have also started to stream into 
northern Iraq's Seranish and Sinaht areas.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy, Germany To Serve Two Years </F>
on Security Council"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) New York, June 1 -- Italy and Germany have 
been put forward by the Western nations to take over, January 1, 
from New Zealand and Spain for a two-year stint among the UN 
Security Council's 10 nonpermanent members, an Italian spokesman 
confirmed here this morning. The candidacy was made after the 
withdrawal of Ireland, Greece, and Sweden, which said it will be 
seeking the job for 1997-98. 
  The appointment is expected to be approved by the UN General 
Assembly in October. 
  The Security Council has five permanent members -- the

States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and 10 nonpermanent

repeatedly requested an enlargement of the Council.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RAY: "First Participation by East </F>
European Navies in NATO Exercise"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (BELGA) -- Some 50 NATO ships, 
including some from Belgium, and from the eight countries 
bordering the Baltic Sea will participate for the first time in 
a massive joint air and naval exercise from 7 to 10 June, 
military sources said Thursday [2 June]. 
  All in all, 15 countries will be represented in the 
exercise, 
code-named Baltic Operations 94 (shortened to Baltops 94). The 
Belgian Navy will send a frigate, the Wandelaar, while the 
Russian Baltic fleet will send the destroyer Neustrsashhimy, 
according to a Belgian military spokesman. 
  The seven other non-NATO countries invited as observers for 
the first phase of the exercise are Estonia, Finland, Ireland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden. This is the first time 
that so many neutral and former Warsaw Pact countries are 
participating in allied naval maneuvers. 
  Some 40 NATO ships provided by the German, Belgian, British, 
Danish, Netherlands, Norwegian, and American Navies will then 
continue the maneuvers among themselves until 17 June, according 
to the German naval staff at Glucksburg (in Schleswig-Holstein 
in northern Germany). Nevertheless, they will put in at Gdynia 
(Poland), the same source added. 
  The maneuver will be directed by Admiral David R. Morris, 
the 
U.S. Navy second-in-command in Europe. 
  Baltops 94 will be the 22d time this annual exercise has 
been 
performed.

<F P=106> [Report signed "tom/APA": "Klestil: `Not a Moment of Lone </F>
Action'"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Regarding Austria's membership in the 
European Union [EU], the Austrian people will be exposed to a 
serious test of their identity. It will also show their 
contradictory character. 
  On the one hand, the people are "European champions 
regarding 
patriotism." As many as 79 percent see themselves "solely as 
Austrians," no more than 17 percent "also as Europeans." On the 
other hand, only one-third of the citizens (two-thirds in 
Switzerland) believe that "their own political system is very 
good." One-third of the Austrians even find "their system" bad. 
  This information was given by university professors Fritz 
Plasser and Ernst Bruckmueller at the beginning of a symposium 
of the Industrialists' Association (IV) in Vienna on "Austria's 
Identity in a Larger Europe." The consequences are obvious for 
political scientists and historians. They say that there is 
remarkable "inner resistance" against the EU and against what is 
new. 
<H5>  Excessive Burden </H5>
  The European integration process calls the image Austrians 
have of themselves (culture, great scenery, but not quite the 
managerial skills of the Germans) into question and will lead to 
"an excessive burden on decisionmaking." 
  Against this background, outstanding individuals made 
statements in the discussion -- Cardinal Franz Koenig, Theo 
Sommer, publisher of DIE ZEIT and a former planning chief in the 
Bonn Defense Ministry under chancellor Willy Brandt, the 
historian Brigitte Hamann, director Helmut Felderer of the 
Institute for Higher Studies, and Polish Ambassador Bartoszewski. 
  President Thomas Klestil made his first comprehensive 
statement prior to the referendum and called upon Austrians to 
demonstrate solidarity. He said that this was "not the time of 
pursuing party politics or acquiring personal status at the 
expense of European policy." Nor was it "a test run" for 
parliamentary elections or a "reminder regarding problems that 
are not at issue." 
  The president said he wished to see "all those" gather "who 
are convinced of the urgency of a larger, common Europe" and 
form a "group of responsible and farsighted Austrians." In the 
postwar era, the Austrians in particular had proved to 
themselves and to the world that unity is strength. This had 
been demonstrated most recently in Brussels when the agreement 
was concluded. 
<H5>  Developing Tolerance </H5>
  Klestil said the Austrians did not have to be afraid of 
Europe, because "no other membership candidate has ever been 
better prepared than we." It should also be stressed that "we 
will not lose our identity." The "really great task" in the EU 
would be that Austria "will bring in the values of tolerance and 
the many colors of a multicultural society." 
  Industry Association secretary general Franz Ceska warned 
about "a strange mixture" of "fearfulness and pompousness." 
People should not let themselves be influenced by a feeling of 
uncertainty. However, EU membership was "indispensable" for the 
country's industry, he said. 
  Johannes Voggenhuber, spokesman for the Greens on EU 
affairs, 
on 30 May criticized the government once again for "making 
propaganda instead of providing real information." He said that 
copies of the membership treaties for the citizens were out of 
print. 
  Freedom Party secretary general Karl-Heinz Grasser spoke 
about attempts at blackmailing the citizens. "Regarding 
democracy," EU membership would be "a relapse into the 19th 
century."

  [Excerpt] Following a decision by the Belgian Government, 
the Libyan Embassy in Brussels can now freely resume regular 
payments of its current expenses through banks. This was made 
possible after negotiations between the Belgian Foreign and

cabinet meeting to issue a ministerial order exempting the 
embassy from complicated procedures to pay for its transactions.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Renate Koecher: "Germany Is Growing Old--Who </F>
Is Concerned About It?--Tomorrow's Elderly Are Scarcely Bothered 
About the Future"] 
  [Text] Germany is getting older, but those who will have to 
deal with this fact hardly seem to care. All in all, only 
one-third of the population has taken note of the problem, but 
the elderly of the future -- that is, those who are under 45 
today -- have not. Only a few people realize how dramatically 
the demographics of the population have changed during the 
course of this century and how dynamically this trend will 
continue over the next decades. 
  In 1980, one German out of five was over 60. By the year 
2000, one out of four will be, and in 2030, 37 percent of the 
population are expected to be over 60. 
  Thirty years ago, the ratio between Germans over 65 and 
those 
under 20 was 10:25. By the year 2000 the two age groups will be 
about equal, and by the year 2030 the ratio will be just about 
10:6. A backward look at the year 1871 demonstrates how 
historically unique the present situation is. In 1871, the 
corresponding ratio was 10:94. In other words, society was 
fantastically young, by current standards. 
  Although hardly anyone has taken a hard look at these 
statistics, most people are aware of the fact that the 
consequences will be serious indeed. Seventy-seven percent 
expect old age insurance premiums to rise, 69 percent believe 
the retirement age will be moved up, and 67 percent think social 
security payments will be cut. They are convinced that the final 
outcome will be lower minimum government compensations which 
will have to be augmented by private pension plans. Sixty 
percent expect health insurance premiums to rise as well. 
  The aging of society is viewed by people primarily as a 
fiscal problem which calls for a reordering of the generational 
contract and of the social insurance systems. This realization 
does not mean that such a restructuring would come easy. When a 
debate took place earlier this year on whether pensions would 
have to be cut as net incomes decline--a logical consequence of 
tying pensions to net wages--it became clear that the population 
did not want pensions to be tampered with in the foreseeable 
future. At the time, two-thirds were in favor of uncoupling 
pensions and net wages whenever wages decline. In essence, 
however, people are aware of the fact that the social insurance 
systems will not survive in their present form when more than 
one-third of the population will be 60 years of age or over. 
People are similarly skeptical about their own security in old 
age. Only one out of every four people believe they will be able 
to maintain their standard of living when they are old. Twenty 
percent expect to have to cut down, but do not believe they will 
be short of money. One-third of the population expects to have 
to cut down a lot. These are speculations for the most part. 
Only a small minority is genuinely well informed about their own 
pension rights and only a few are able to foresee at all 
accurately how their own financial situation will develop over 
the next few decades in terms of savings, housing purchases, and 
inheritances. But skepticism clearly does cause people to think 
of the future. Security in old age has become an increasingly 
important incentive for savings. 
  The levels against which the retirees of the future measure 
their own expectations are high. Over the past few years 
material satisfaction has increased most markedly in the over-60 
age group. At this time, 80 percent of all retirees are 
satisfied with their financial situation--84 percent in western 
Germany and 64 percent in eastern Germany. In the future, it 
will only be possible to maintain these levels of satisfaction 
with the help of private retirement plans. 
  In addition to individual retirement plans people pin their 
hopes on family policies which might counteract the aging of 
society. Support for families with children is viewed as the 
best family policy. Few people are in favor of immigration as a 
way of rejuvenating the population. A mere 10 percent are for 
and fully 70 percent are against even partially compensating for 
demographic trends by means of targeted support for immigration. 
Only a minority believes that the demographic changes might lead 
to a labor shortage which could solely be resolved with the help 
of foreign workers. 
  Aside from the prospect of additional costs for the social 
security systems only a minority of the population has a clear 
idea of what the consequences of the aging of society might be. 
If at all, people anticipate generational conflicts, due above 
all to redistribution struggles as the social contract between 
the generations is restructured. Forty-two percent are afraid 
that tensions between the young and the old generation will 
arise--although there is nothing to indicate that this fear is 
justified at present. As of now, relations between the older and 
younger generations are good, better in fact than they have been 
for decades; and as long as family ties are as highly valued as 
they are, there is hardly any reason to believe that 
generational conflicts over material issues will arise. 
  Only a small number of people expects the generational power 
structure to change at the expense of the young generation. 
Eighteen percent believe that political life will be pegged 
increasingly to the needs of the older generation, and 17 
percent believe that the influence of the young generation is 
continually declining. 
  In essence, the impact of the older generation on election 
outcomes will increase more significantly than the demographic 
changes might lead one to expect, since the number of young 
voters has markedly declined in the eighties and nineties, 
whereas the number of over-60 voters is 17 percent greater today 
than that of voters under the age of 30. This trend works to the 
particular advantage of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union [CDU/CSU] which most people view as being 
supportive of the older generation. forty-five percent of those 
over 60 feel that the CDU/CSU champions the interests of the 
older generation more than other political parties. Only 23 
percent feel that these interests are best served by the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD]. 
  As in the case of the restructuring of the generational 
contract, most people do not believe that the older generation's 
growing influence on political life will lead to conflict 
between the generations and a one-sided dominance of the older 
generation's goals and values. 
<H5>  May Opinion Poll: Optimism Is Back </H5>
  The SPD is losing ground. In early April, 40.6 percent of 
the 
voters were prepared to vote for the Social Democrats on their 
second ballots. In early May, it was only 36.3 percent. The 
party has been harmed above all by the debate about its taxation 
plans. In western Germany, the SPD's losses are benefiting the 
Greens, and in eastern Germany, the CDU and the Free Democratic 
Party [FDP]. The CDU has been gaining ground in the new laender 
for the past 4 months. 
  By now, 26.8 percent of east Germans are prepared to cast 
their second ballots for the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag election, 
i.e. 5 percent higher than in February. The SPD, on the other 
hand, has lost more than five percentage points in eastern 
Germany over the past four weeks. Hopes are waning that the SPD, 
with the Greens, will win the Bundestag election. As of now, 
only 46 percent in western Germany or 6 percent less than four 
weeks ago still believe that will happen. In the new laender 48 
percent or 9 percent less than a month ago still believe the SPD 
and the Greens will win. 
  As of now, only one out of five west Germans has doubts 
about 
the leadership qualifications of the government as against one 
out of three last January. In the new laender only 15 percent 
feel this way as against 22 percent early this year. Chancellor 
Kohl's policies are finding greater favor. Approval of Scharping 
is also increasing, but his lead has shrunk still further: in 
the old laender from 6 to 4 percent and in the new laender from 
15 to 8 percent. The population is taking careful note of these 
figures. In early April, 44 percent of west Germans viewed 
Scharping as the favorite as against only 26 percent for Kohl. 
Now, 38 percent still believe Scharping is in the lead, as 
against 32 percent who give Kohl the nod. 
  Germans in general, and west Germans in particular, are 
growing more optimistic with time. Forty-one percent of west 
Germans now expect the economy to recover within the next six 
months as against 27 percent in early April. In eastern Germany, 
31 percent, or 8 percent more than a month ago, now believe 
things will change for the better. Only 23 percent of the 
population are afraid there will be another recession. Thus, the 
results of the poll reflect positive economic expectations for 
the first time since November 1992.

<F P=106> [Joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Silvio </F>
Berlusconi and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Rome on 2 June -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Helen Thomas, 
in English with simultaneous Italian translation] I would like 
you to tell the president why so many people think that your 
government is leaning toward fascism. In your statement, you 
spoke about greater intervention in world crises. Do you want 
to send troops into Bosnia to fight in that country? 
  [Berlusconi] I can tell you what is actually happening in 
Italy and in my government. In Italy, there is no nostalgia for 
a period that we consider to be buried in the past and condemned 
by history. All the surveys that have been carried out on this 
issue have shown that less than 1 percent of Italians -- the 
last survey said exactly 0.4 percent of Italians - have what 
could be termed nostalgia, and perhaps that is even going a bit 
far, for fascism. So this problem does not exist and has nothing 
to do with the real state of affairs. Moreover, the government 
that I head and which is made up of the ministers I chose does 
not contain, nor could it ever contain, any minister who is not 
a democratic minister, any minister who does not believe in 
freedom and democracy or who does not believe that 
totalitarianism must always be fought. 
  As to the second part of your question, we have discussed 
the 
possibility of international organizations taking more effective 
action in the future. Concerning specific situations in the 
world -- the former Yugoslavia is one, but there is also Rwanda, 
and other situations in Africa, of which Somalia is an example 
-- a great deal has been done. When they see all these tragic 
scenes on television, all our people ask themselves whether 
enough has been done. I know that it is not easy to find 
solutions, and I do not think anyone believes that by simply 
sending in troops things can be solved. Nevertheless, I believe 
that the international organizations must pay the utmost 
attention to what is happening in the world so that through 
diplomatic action they can prevent potential crises from 
developing and giving rise to many disasters, much pain and 
suffering. Above all, I believe that everything must be done to 
prevent a wound from becoming a permanent and incurable ulcer 
and a a continuous cause of pain and suffering. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Could I ask Mr. Berlusconi 
something? Since any judgement about the government must be 
based on concrete facts, we would like to know which measures 
will be put before parliament first and most urgently, and how 
does he intend to move in the Senate, where he only has a very 
narrow majority? Also, I would like to ask President Clinton 
what he thinks about the possibility of Italian troops 
participating in the UN mission in former Yugoslavia -- whether 
or not he agrees with this. 
  [Berlusconi] I do not believe that we should bore our guests 
with matters concerning domestic politics, which have already 
been explained several times in the presentations of the 
government's manifesto to the Senate and in the replies to 
questions in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. We know 
very well that we are waiting for a relaunch of the economy and 
for growth and that we must tackle the central problem of 
creating new jobs. We will proceed in this direction, and let 
me say that on this matter I can clearly remember what President 
Clinton said in Detroit a few months ago, when he stated that 
the employment problem could not be solved by state 
intervention, but that the state should encourage private 
initiative, which is the real engine and can create new jobs. I 
also remember that on that occasion he outlined what he thought 
were the best ways of tackling the problem and specifically that 
of a different relationship between man and work. In other 
words, a different way of looking at the changing face of work 
to achieve greater flexibility in the labor market -- and a 
determined effort on everyone's part to improve training. We 
are following the very same line, and we are already making 
changes, because this government has restored confidence to 
business, to the many millions of Italian businessman on whom 
our particular kind of wealth is based and who would have felt 
let down by other governments, but who now have the promise of 
intervention to support them, of various measures, of a tax 
truce, and above all have the promise to change the stance of 
the machinery of politics and bureaucracy toward those who take 
risks and do business, who have already started again and who 
are looking with trust and optimism to the future of their 
companies. I believe that is what we should worry about doing 
and it is what we are already doing. 
  As for the second part of the question, I am not at all 
worried because certain committees appointed chairpersons who do 
not belong to the majority parties. I believe that the road is 
long, and I continue to be optimistic -- I still think that the 
minority parties have accepted the outcome of the election and 
the Italians' desire for a working government and that the 
minority parties will not want to be destructive or to hinder 
government, but that they intend to judge policies individually, 
for the good of the country. The minority parties will be 
vigilant, careful, and will analyse things, but they will work 
for and not against government.

  [Text] After a meeting to discuss UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report, the political council of the Free 
Democrats Movement issued a statement saying that the report 
offers a unique opportunity to our side to bring negotiations 
back to the substance of the Cyprus issue and to ask for 
measures, if the Turkish side refuses to do so. The Free 
Democrats say that for this reason, the only option for our side 
is to accept the UN secretary general's third alternative, which 
provides for the end of talks on the confidence-building 
measures and a return to discussions on the basis of a set of 
concepts and Butrus-Ghali's map. 
  The political council has learned that the UN secretary 
general's report reveals the extent of the unacceptable 
concessions made by our side. It adds, however, that one can 
see a significant and positive point made in the report--the 
lack of political will by the Turkish side for a solution to the 
Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Ankara, June 2 (A.A.) -- Cabinet on Thursday [2 
June] approved of National Security Council's decision to extend 
emergency rule for another four months starting from July 19. 
  `The government has decided to propose to parliament the 
extension of the state of emergency from July 19,' government 
spokesman Yildirim Aktuna said after a cabinet meeting chaired 
by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 
  Aktuna who is also state minister said government has a 
successful struggle with terrorism and the separatist terrorist 
organization lost logistic support and power. 
  The emergency rule is in practice in Batman, Bingol, Bitlis, 
Diyarbakir, Hakkari, Mardin, Siirt, Sirnak, Tunceli and Van 
Provinces. 
  The state of emergency is imposed under an agreement which 
needs parliamentary approval every four months. It gives 
extraordinary powers to an emergency rule governor in Diyarbakir 
who coordinates between military and civilian authorities in the 
fight against terrorism. 
  The powers include the right to impose curfews or block off 
entry and exits to villages if there has been an incident.

  [Text] Muslim youth from various ethnic groups in Serbia's 
Sandzak province are being brought secretly to Turkey and 
trained at Urla and Foca. The first group arrived in 1993 for 
commando training by Turkish officers. It has been ascertained 
that 754 young men have gone through this training since the 
beginning of 1994. At present 500 young men are being trained 
at Urla. After completing their training, they returned to 
Sandzak and were told "to bomb various government buildings and 
assassinate political figures." 
  The parents of the young men are told that "they are going 
to 
attend higher educational institutes in Turkey." But the 
parents do not know what their sons are doing in Turkey or which 
school they are attending. The only liaison for them in Turkey 
is the Sandzak Intelligence Center in Ankara. It is said that 
this center is being run by the General Secretariat of the 
[Turkish] National Security Council [NSC]. 
<H5>  Murat Bayrak's Planes </H5>
  The young men picked up from the various regions of Sandzak 
are assembled at the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] capital Skopje. Here, they are given "pocket 
money" of 300 to 500 DM [Deutsche Mark] on behalf of the 
President of Sandzak, Suleyman Uglanin [name and title as 
published], and then they are flown to Izmir on planes from 
Sandzak Airlines, which belongs to Murat Bayrak's son Mustafa 
Bayrak. It is also said that Murat Bayrak is contributing 
financially to this project. It is stressed that Bayrak, who is 
from Sandzak, has contacts with Suleyman Uglanin. 
  AYDINLIK made inquiries with Murat Bayrak in Bonn and 
Mustafa 
Bayrak in Istanbul on this matter. There were no replies from 
either Bayrak when our paper went to press. 
<H5>  A Deputy's Confessions </H5>
  This came into the open with the publication of confessions 
by Harun Hacic [name as published], a deputy at the former 
Sandzak Autonomous Parliament, in the October 1993 issue of 
ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA magazine, which is published in Serbian in 
Belgrade and sold in European cities. Hacic was caught 
red-handed during the operation carried out by the Yugoslav 
police at the beginning of 1993 to detain the young people 
trained as commandos in Turkey and organizers of the project. A 
considerable amount of arms and military hardware that were 
buried in his garden were seized. Following an exhaustive 
interrogation of Hacic, the Sandzak police detained 80 people. 
The interrogation of the detainees has been continuing over the 
past year. ZAMAN and MILLI GAZETE [both published in Turkey] 
have been campaigning for the last two weeks for the detained. 
<H5>  U.S.-Saudi-Ozal Operation </H5>
  The first official contact on training the Muslim youths in 
Turkey was made during Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's 
visit to then President Turgut Ozal in Ankara at the end of 1992. 
  Uglanin is the head of the Sandzak branch of Democratic 
Action Party (SDA) of Alija Izetbegovic, the president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. SDA is supported by Saudi Arabia and the 
United States. 
  The project of training the Sandzak Muslims in Turkey is 
part 
of a plan to create "a Muslim state in parts of Serbia and 
Montenegro." This also complies with the views of Izetbegovic's 
party, which is active in Sandzak. It was the United States 
that put forward the plan to establish a Muslim state in Europe. 
Saudi Arabia is openly supporting it. Besides, Turkey's secret 
diplomacy on Balkans is being financed by Saudi Arabia. 
  Deputy Hacic, whose confessions have already been published, 
is Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's right-hand man. In his 
statement he said that "it was Uglanin who first told me about 
the groups to be dispatched to Turkey." He said Uglanin 
explained the aim behind the action as thus: "At first, to 
secure a special status for Sandzak, and then to form an 
independent Muslim Sandzak step-by-step." 
  Sandzak is a multiethnic and multidenominational autonomous 
region between Macedonia and Kosovo [as published]. The 
spreading of war to heavily Muslim populated Sandzak or Kosovo 
would create a regional crisis engulfing Greece, Turkey, 
Bulgaria, and Macedonia. The United States is banking more and 
more on using Turkey in its plans with Muslims in the Balkans. 
The statement of Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, said 
that "we have the largest army in the region, and have gained 
experience in guerrilla warfare," meaning that the Balkan and 
Caucasian wars are not regular but guerrilla warfares. 
<H5>  Kahramanyol Is the Leading Man </H5>
  Mustafa Kahramanyol heads the activity providing Sandzak 
youth with commando training in Turkey. Kahramanyol, who is 
from Sandzak, is an expert on the Balkans Desk of the NSC 
General Secretariat and is also an adviser in the prime 
minister's office. After a long pause, Kahramanyol replied to 
AYDINLIK's questions by saying: "I am a government official, I 
cannot comment on this issue." 
  Hacic's confession published in ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA 
includes 
names of the organization's members: Sokol Ahmetovic [name as 
published], the responsible official in the city of Yeni Pazar 
[Novi Pazar], who organizes the contact with the young men. 
Cemal Kolasinatz [name as published] is one of the former 
Yugoslav army officers. Kolasinatz arranges the travel of the 
groups to and from Turkey. 
  [The article is accompanied by a picture that shows a group 
of people squatting in a field handling pistols. The caption 
says: "The special warfare official Lieutenant Colonel Korkut 
Eken, who was expelled from the organization after the incident 
involving MIT, National Intelligence Organization, heads the 
Urla camp where the Special Army is being trained. Foca camp 
specializes in commando training. The special warfare officials 
are organizing the training in both camps."]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Alain Chastagnol: "Clinton and Europe"] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton returns to Europe today for the 
second time, surrounded by confusion. He is due to join in the 
celebrations of the 1944 operation, to "cloak himself in the 
prestige of Normandy," although he has never experienced war and 
escaped the Vietnam War. He is due to reaffirm "Lafayette, we 
are here!" although he is more concerned with domestic policy 
than foreign policy and often advocates isolationism. 
  The criticisms of his foreign policy are now building up: 
vacillation and sudden about-faces on China's trade privileges, 
on Haiti, on Somalia, or North Korea; with regard to Bosnia in 
particular where the French, who urged a negotiated agreement, 
think that he is not going far enough and fast enough. "I am 
doing what I can in face of very difficult problems," Bill 
Clinton said, which is a far cry from the authority of Ronald 
Reagan, whose panache and emotion worked miracles in Normandy 
itself in 1984. 
  The U.S. President nonetheless knows that Europe is vital to 
him. He studied at Oxford. He has had the D-Day landings 
explained to him. He said before his departure that the 
Americans had then understood that they were taking part in a 
historic action and that there could be no security in the 
United States if it did not defend "freedom." Is this enough to 
shoulder the role of world policeman, which Bush intended to 
play? Probably not. But it is enough to understand our 
interdependence. 
  It is enough to propose, with more credibility than any 
other 
U.S. President, that Europe should take control of its own 
affairs. Clinton wants a "united and strong" Europe. The 
European defense initiative has never been viewed more favorably 
and the U.S. President would not be annoyed if the Eurocorps 
troops, the precursor to the European intervention force, were 
to march down the Champs-Elysees on 14 July. 
  In four days' time lyricism will prevail. It could result in 
a salutary European reorientation if the strong solidarity of 
the past and France's gratitude for it finally find their 
present-day military and political expression. There would then 
be at least one lesson learned from history.

<F P=106> [Report by Anne Fulda: "Bosnia: Juppe Asserts His </F>
Convictions"] 
  [Excerpts] Montpellier -- After the big show of support by 
the UDF [French Democratic Union] in Lyons on Tuesday [31 May], 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who is secretary general of the 
RPR [Rally for the Republic], came to Montpellier yesterday to 
encourage the "Union" list of the majority. Flanked by Philippe 
Vasseur, the general secretary of the Republican Party [PR] and 
a deputy for the Pas-de-Calais region; Dominique Baudis; and 
Jacques Blanc, president of the regional council of 
Languedoc-Roussillon (PR), the minister's speech focused on 
three main subjects: the challenge of unemployment, the 
challenge of European Union [EU] enlargement, and the challenge 
of Yugoslavia. 
  Alain Juppe devoted the main part of his speech to this last 
subject, in which he takes a particular interest, especially 
after the attacks he endured recently by the still-born "Europe 
Begins in Sarajevo" list. [passage omitted] 
  Alain Juppe clearly stated his position on the lifting of 
the 
arms embargo on the Muslims, a measure requested by the 
"intellectuals' list" and by [Socialist Party Secretary 
General] Michel Rocard. He admitted that "once the 
international community had accepted the birth of new 
independent states, maintaining this embargo perhaps was a 
mistake, or rather a case of injustice." Nevertheless, he 
argued, "today the situation is radically different.... In view 
of the operational constraints imposed on our forces, the idea 
of lifting the arms embargo is simplistic.... I believe it 
would be disastrous." The minister hammered the point home: 
"If certain countries were to disregard the embargo, Russia 
would take the side of the Serbs. The war would spread 
immediately and the Bosnians would be condemned to military 
defeat even more certainly than before." 
  Alain Juppe concluded by saying: "Lifting the embargo is 
certainly a mobilizing slogan, but it would make things worse. 
This is why I am proposing the exact opposite step: Instead of 
increasing the number of heavy weapons in Bosnia, we must reduce 
their number; instead of giving weapons to those who do not have 
as many, we must take away weapons from those who have too 
many." He added: "Do those people in France and elsewhere who 
are encouraging the fighting to continue realize that they are 
likely to cause misfortune to people whose cause they think they 
are defending?"

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Gautier: "Foreign Minister Answers </F>
Critics -- Bosnia: France Intends To Set Example"] 
  [Text] Called a "politician that thrives on abdication" by 
Bernard-Henry Levy and a "coward" by Andre Glucksmann, Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe took advantage of the 63d French-German 
summit to launch his counterattack. 
  First by insisting on the "determined" policy of the French 
Government in Bosnia: "Once again setting an example, France 
has just contributed 25 million francs for the reconstruction of 
Sarajevo. The money will be used to restore the power 
distribution network, following an EDF [French Electrical 
Company] evaluation mission in the city." The minister added: 
"To my knowledge, we are the prime contributor of funds to 
Sarajevo." 
  Then, having learned of the withdrawal of the "Europe Begins 
in Sarajevo" list while he was still in Mulhouse for the summit, 
he turned on the acid tap: "The saga ends in farce," the 
minister taunted. "I have only one other thing to say: 
Bernard-Henry Levy's list's motto must have been something like 
'let us be brave and run away from voters!'" 
  The foreign minister emphasized that current talks are based 
on the "Juppe-Kinkel plan" developed in December 1993, which 
made it possible to bring the Bosnians back to the negotiating 
table. The plan, Mr. Juppe went on, places the city of Mostar 
under European (specifically French and German) control as part 
of UN Resolutions 900 and 908. "This is a highly symbolic 
operation," Mr. Juppe said in Mulhouse, since the person put in 
charge of it is former Bremen Mayor Hans Koschnik. 
<H5>  Support From Sarajevo </H5>
  Although Paris has been preparing to "redeploy its forces 
around Sarajevo," as President Mitterrand put it, France still 
has some 7,000 blue helmets in Bosnia and Croatia. France is 
"the leading contributor of troops for peace keeping" in the 
former Yugoslavia, the foreign minister reminded his audience. 
  In an interview with LE FIGARO, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic praised the "new accents" of French policy. At the 
time when Gorazde was being besieged and the United Nations 
refused to strike Serb positions, Sarajevo's strongman stated: 
"We are grateful to the French Government for its firm stand in 
favor of the use of force to bring this war to an end." The 
Bosnian prime minister maintained that Mr. Juppe "knows the 
situation inside out." 
  This does not mean that there have been no contradictions in 
France's position. Indeed Muhamed Secirbegovic, Bosnia's 
ambassador to the United Nations, pointed out that France 
simultaneously hosted two conferences on central European issues 
last week. "While one, the Balladur plan [for stability in 
Europe] in Paris, insisted on border inviolability and minority 
rights, the other, in Talloires, completed the job of carving up 
Bosnia." 
  Nevertheless, U.S. President Bill Clinton told France that 
it 
should "continue" its efforts and "remain in Bosnia as long as 
all potential avenues for settlement have not been explored." 
Mr. Clinton, who was speaking on the eve of his trip to Europe 
to celebrate of the 50th anniversary of the Normandy landing, 
said that "it is still possible that the belligerents realize 
that they may keep fighting into the next century without being 
able to solve their problems through the use of arms."

Bosnia-Herzegovina were set to resume here Monday morning [6 
June], Bosnian Government Ambassador Mohammed Sacirbey said. 
  "All conditions are met. Negotiations on an overall 
ceasefire will proceed this morning," he told reporters. 
  The mostly Moslem Bosnian government had earlier rejected a 
resumption of talks because of the failure by armed Serbs to 
withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) radius area around 
the east Bosnian town of Gorazde, in defiance of UN demands.

<F P=106> [Interview with EC Commission President Jacques Delors by </F>
announcer Anne Sinclair; from the "Seven Out of Seven" program 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening, Mr. Delors. [passage 
omitted] Gianfranco Fini, head of the Italian neofascists, told 
LA STAMPA yesterday: D-Day brought freedom back to Italy, and I 
welcome it as a positive event, but was it not also the day when 
Europe lost its cultural identity? How does Jacques Delors 
react to such words? 
  [Delors] I was very angry when I read that. So far, I have 
followed the usual rule and -- as president of the European 
Commission -- I avoided commenting on what happens in Italy. 
All the more so, because I think that if we comment beforehand, 
we are likely to spoil the chances of those who want to limit 
the possible resurgence of neofascism. But now we must not only 
be very vigilant, we must be both vigilant and worried. He also 
added that until 1938 -- when Mussolini passed the racist laws 
-- fascism could not be considered as something negative. He 
also added that there are moments when freedom is not the main 
value. At this point, I got very worried. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Something else on Italy: You agree with the 
criticisms and reservations expressed by Francois Mitterrand 
rather than the good conduct report issued to Berlusconi by Bill 
Clinton two days ago? 
  [Delors] Why did Bill Clinton do that? Because, according to 
his analysis, he thinks that within the government coalition 
there are people who can stop the rise of neofascism. This is 
why he is giving his support to the coalition forces just a few 
weeks after the elections. Maybe in many months' time he will 
act differently. It will all depend on what those people will do 
and say. 
  [Sinclair] [passage omitted] Jacques Delors, I would like 
you 
to watch with us the interview which Bill Clinton gave to TF1 -- 
I can see you getting your notes out -- to TF1 and "Seven Out of 
Seven." This is the only French television station to which he 
decided to speak before his trip to Europe. The interview, 
which he gave me, took place in Washington, at the White House, 
on Friday 27 May. [passage omitted; recording of interview with 
President Clinton, who answers questions on U.S. policy on 
Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti, and on relations with Russia, and 
stresses desire for a strong Europe] 
  [Sinclair] Jacques Delors, I saw you listening very 
carefully 
and taking notes on the interview. We will look at several 
points shortly. Regarding the last question: I am in agreement 
with Francois Mitterrand, says Bill Clinton -- do you really 
think America wishes to have a strong Europe, or is this 
diplomatic language? 
  [Delors] I had doubts for years, but after my talks with 
President Clinton I am certain that he wants a strong Europe. 
Of course, the United States remains a top power. It is 
difficult to carry out certain actions without it, but we have 
come back to the thinking of those who wanted a strong Europe, 
although one has to deserve it. Let me give you an example. 
  [Sinclair] You are saying that we have to deserve it? 
  [Delors] Yes, we have to deserve it. Let me give you an 
example. There are 300,000 American soldiers in Europe. There 
will be no more than 100,000 in 1995, or little more than that. 
Are we in a position to form a European army, a pillar of the 
Atlantic Alliance, at the service of the UN resolutions to 
ensure that peace, the freedom and independence of peoples is 
respected? This is the question which is put to us. 
  [Sinclair] And what is your reply, in your opinion are we 
ready or not? 
  [Delors] We are not yet quite ready, but it is not by 
rejecting what has already been accomplished in the construction 
of Europe that we will make progress toward this objective. 
  [Sinclair] Russia might be present at the July G-7 meeting. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Delors] I would personally include other countries in the 
G-7. 
  [Sinclair] Which countries, for example? 
  [Delors] I think there should be an African country like 
Nigeria; China, when it respects democratic rules, India and 
Mexico. [passage omitted]. As for Russia, I think there is 
quite a contrast between Russia the big political power and 
Russia plagued by all its economic problems. But I think Russia 
the great political power is now working for peace. [passage 
omitted] On the other hand, I am very worried about the 
economic situation. 
  [Sinclair] You are very worried about today's Russia. But 
this renders its associate membership in the G-7 a rather 
complicated matter, since the G-7 focuses on the economy. 
  [Delors] This is why in Naples we will discuss the economy 
among ourselves and we will publish a document with the 
forecasts concerning us. The day after, Yeltsin will come for 
the political meeting. There is a difference between the 
economic and political parts of the meeting. 
  [Sinclair] [passage omitted] A word about the countries of 
East Europe, which are asking with increasing frequency to be 
linked to Europe tomorrow and NATO perhaps sooner. We have seen 
in Hungary that the voters voted for the communists. The 
communists are back, they voted democratically for the 
communists, and that is true. Will those linked in the long term 
either to Europe or NATO not be adding political instability to 
economic instability? 
  [Delors] Well, first of all, one has to know those 
communists, and let us leave their past aside, and furthermore 
some of them are very young, like the prime minister of Poland 
-- and I have made a mistake, as he is from the Peasant Party, 
but he governs with the communists. 
  [Sinclair] In Hungary we have seen some of these figures 
returning. 
  [Delors] Yes, in Hungary, but they are extremely competent 
men, but in order to join the European Union one has to fulfill 
three conditions: First, to be a multiparty democracy; second, 
to honor human rights as a whole; and third, to have an economy 
which is not dwarfed, which will not be crushed by the more 
efficient economies of the West. These conditions remain. 
However, at the moment the biggest problem of the countries of 
East Europe, apart from the economy -- although we are helping 
them as well as we can -- the biggest problem is that of 
security. These countries have the feeling of living in a lack 
of security because the problems of minorities arise, border 
questions have apparently not always been solved, and then there 
is the contamination of the Bosnian affair, and, you see, I am 
convinced that if the European Union did not exist then war 
would already have spread throughout the Balkans, and this 
should not be forgotten either. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Do you agree with Bill Clinton who is now saying 
that the Bosnia arms embargo should not be lifted? 
  [Delors] Bill Clinton brilliantly explained to me in May 
1993 
why we should lift the embargo. I understand that he is now 
embarrassed. But when today I hear what our negotiators are 
saying -- David Owen in particular; he is there and has been 
following the events for three years -- I fear that, given the 
Serbs' potential strength, if we lifted the embargo this would 
help the Bosnians and we would really have massacres. Maybe it 
was our fault, although the French minister of foreign affairs 
rightly recalled that we French have many troops deployed there 
and that the European Union has given 60 percent of the 
humanitarian aid, more than anybody else [sentence as heard]. 
We cannot forget that. In spite of all that, we must today 
consider what the situation is. 
  [Sinclair] And what would happen if the Bosnia negotiations 
failed? 
  [Delors] If the negotiations failed we should maybe consider 
lifting the embargo. But I think that lifting the embargo means 
that Western countries would inevitably have to intervene. We 
must understand this. It is not possible to wage war by proxy. 
If we gave weapons to the Bosnians and they were crushed.... 
  [Sinclair, interrupting] They want weapons, not men. 
  [Delors] Yes, indeed. But if they were crushed, it would be 
an even greater victory for ideology. I think that on the basis 
of the peace plan put forward by the European Union -- it is not 
perfect -- and things being what they are, we could have a peace 
solution. Not a very stable one, it would be somewhat 
precarious. But there is a condition: The ideology of ethnic 
cleansing must never be approved and in Serbia they have 
understood what this means. A peaceful Bosnia could cooperate 
with and be helped by the Europeans. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Leo Tindemans, chairman of the European </F>
People's Party, by Dirk Vanoverbeke; place and date not given: 
"Seven Questions for Leo Tindemans"] 
  [Text] [Vanoverbeke] Employment and the economic situation 
are subjects of concern for Europe. What do you think of the 
Commission's white paper on competition and growth? What 
concrete proposals does your party have in order to combat 
unemployment at the European level? 
  [Tindemans] I fully support the Commission's white paper. 
The action plan based upon it and approved by the European 
Council on 11 December 1993 in Brussels must be implemented as 
soon as possible as a matter of priority. The plan is not 
perfect, no plan ever is, but its implementation would make the 
European Union (EU) a large region able to stand up to American 
and Asian competition. The EU would become the best equipped 
region, setting standards in telecommunications, information, 
and transport. It would provide investors and businessmen with 
excellent working conditions. The encouragement for small- and 
medium-sized companies should be welcomed. The idea of an 
infrastructure and public works plan should not be rejected, but 
special attention and constant monitoring by European and 
national authorities is required. 
  [Vanoverbeke] Social Europe seems to leave much to be 
desired. What can be done about that? 
  [Tindemans] An answer in theory to the question is 
relatively 
simple: Europe (except for Great Britain) has approved a social 
charter. The EU is going to have to take some social measures. 
The present conflict with Belgian frontier-zone workers in the 
Netherlands is one example. But I heard Jacques Delors state 
that the principle of subsidiarity also applies to the social 
sector. The difficulty lies in knowing when it must be 
respected. The social debates at the European Parliament were 
usually the scene of great confusion. But social matters must 
not be excluded from the EU's competences. The speech by 
Jacques Delors on 28 May is a good indicator. 
  Maastricht also creates possibilities which have not yet 
been 
fully examined. In the area of education, for example. And we 
must be sure that education in Belgium is among the very best. 
  [Vanoverbeke] When we see the inability of the international 
community to take effective action in the former Yugoslavia, 
European common foreign and security policy seems to have got 
off to a bad start. How can we make it more credible? 
  [Tindemans] Monetary (financial) policy, foreign, and 
defense 
policy remain the most sensitive activities of a sovereign 
state, even if it is a EU member. The situation in the former 
Yugoslavia is an example of this. The only advantage compared 
to 1914 is that Russia, Austria, France, Great Britain, and 
Turkey are not at war but are talking. But, unfortunately, 
there has been no progress on the ethnic front. 
  It was decided at Maastricht to draw up a common foreign and 
security policy. 
  This does not yet exist, it is invoked as an excuse, and it 
will be conducted following the rule of unanimity. Which means 
that not much will be done. On the other hand, if such a policy 
proves impossible, we can already predict the birth of small 
coalitions, heralding a return to the politics of the past. Can 
we not imagine old alliances forming around the negotiating 
table which date back to the First or Second World War? Is that 
what we want? 
  [Vanoverbeke] Are you satisfied with the relations between 
the European Parliament (EP), the Council and the European 
Commission (EC)? What proposal would you make for the 1996 
intergovernmental conference, when the Twelve have to review the 
functioning of the institutions? 
  The relations between the Council, the EC and the EP are not 
good. The so-called interinstitutional dialogue is a farce. We 
saw that yet again during the enlargement debate. I welcome the 
proposal to have the intergovernmental conference on 
institutional reform prepared by three presidents: The 
president of the Council, of the EC and of the EP. These three 
would be forced to listen to the institution they head. We 
would not be obliged to consult the "wise men" who, in the 
present circumstances, would inevitably be dependent upon their 
governments. The result of their discussions would necessarily 
be weak. 
  On 4 May in Strasbourg, I was able to cite four letters from 
the German chancellor, and the Belgian, Netherlands, and 
Luxembourg prime ministers. They were in favor of setting up a 
working party consisting of members of the Council, EP, and EC 
to be charged with drawing up reform proposals to be submitted 
to the 1996 conference. I also approve this proposal. 
  The basic philosophy behind the Treaty of Rome was inspired 
in outlining the role of the EC and the EP. But enlargement has 
brought a need for increasing democratization. What is the 
future EP's task, role, and competence to be? How is the EC to 
be reformed? It has too many members. I have very clear 
answers to these questions, but negotiations have not yet begun. 
In any event, the EP cannot be excluded from the 1996 
conference which could be either the crowning glory or the end 
of the Europe of the founding fathers. 
  [Vanoverbeke] The EU sees itself as a grouping of nations 
with a common commitment to democracy. How should we respond to 
the present rise of extremists? 
  [Tindemans] The treaties are perfectly clear about this: The 
EU is a grouping of democratic nations. Each member state must 
therefore ensure that their democracy remains healthy. This 
question is now very pertinent in Italy. But the spirit of the 
times cannot be governed by laws or regulations. On the 
contrary, they are usually dictated by it. Combating 
unemployment, ensuring a high standard of education, 
contributing to a housing policy, dealing with racism and 
xenophobia, ensuring the internal security of one's own country 
and of Europe: These are a whole series of proposals which can 
help create a genuine climate of tolerance and balance. They 
must permit the rebirth of good sense, at home and elsewhere. 
  [Vanoverbeke] Do you still believe the plan for economic and 
monetary union (EMU) to be feasible, given the developing 
economic situation? Should the convergence criteria or the 
timetable for EMU be reviewed? 
  [Tindemans] I still believe in EMU. I was pleased to learn 
that the European Council ratified the Maastricht decisions in 
December 1993 in Brussels. Doubt in this area would have 
reawakened international speculation. In principle, we must 
stick to the criteria and timetable adopted in Maastricht if we 
want confidence to remain intact. It is within this framework 
that governments and experts must act "for the best." 
  [Vanoverbeke] The European elections are often seen as a 
test 
at national level. Does not this trend generate a certain 
ambiguity, threatening to overshadow the interests of Europe? 
  [Tindemans] We cannot condemn strongly enough this politics 
of opportunism which consists of presenting the European 
elections as the ideal occasion to wreak vengeance upon the 
national government. 
  In Europe, we must implement the white paper, achieve 
monetary union, and draw up a common foreign and security 
policy. All of which extends far beyond the context of Belgian 
politics. Those who seek to confuse the European dream and 
reality with mere domestic concerns are betraying the most 
inspiring idea of our century: That of leaving behind us 
hatred, jealousy, and war between hereditary enemies to prepare, 
together, a new chapter in European history.

<F P=106> [Article by Ola Hellblom, Agneta Jonsson, and Mosse Wallen: </F>
"EU Election Will Cost Nordic Area 500 Million Kronor"] 
  [Text] Roughly 500 million kronor [Kr] will go on campaign 
and voting costs in the run-up to the referenda on membership of 
the European Union (EU) in Sweden, Norway, and Finland this 
fall. Large proportions of this money will be spent to pay for 
the vote itself. The strategies being followed for the 
information campaigns vary tremendously in the three countries 
concerned. 
  In Sweden, it is expected that the "Yes" campaigners will 
contribute most in the form of support from the SAF [Swedish 
Employers' Confederation] and also the business sector. In 
Norway, it may be the "No" voters who free up the most funds in 
the form of contributions from the Norwegian farmers' movement. 
Meanwhile, in Finland both the "No" and the "Yes" camps are 
encouraging restraint with regard to campaign funds. 
<H5>  Low Finnish Budget </H5>
  "Low budget" is the watchword when Finland votes on the EU 
on 
16 October. 
  The vote itself will cost the state Kr135 million, and only 
Kr17 million will be split up between more than 30 different 
organizations which are fighting for or against membership, or 
merely want information about the EU. 
  More than 30 organizations fighting for "Yes," "No," or 
merely wanting information about the EU have so far received 
state subsidies for their activity, albeit not much, for a mere 
Kr3 million has already been distributed. However, a further 
Kr14 million will be released this summer. 
  In addition to the Kr17 million which the state will give to 
the campaign organizations, the "Yes" campaigners can count on 
receiving substantial support from the Finnish business sector's 
employers' and industrial organization, TT. 
  "However, there will not be any larger sums than that," said 
TT President Johannes Koroma, who has already paid out Kr7 
million for various publications. 
  This surprising piece of news on the "Yes" side is 
well-founded, partly because industry is terrified of repeating 
the abortive nuclear power lobbying of last year, and partly 
because it has learned from the mistakes made at the time of the 
first EU referendum in Denmark. 
  In both cases, industry's massive lobbying backfired and led 
to the opposite result to the one intended. 
  "I think Sweden began the whole EU debate too soon," said 
Leif Fast, who is president of the business sector's "Ekonomiska 
Informationsbyran" [Economic Information Office] in Helsinki, 
which is handling lobbying and information about the EU on 
behalf of the TT: "The people will not be interested so many 
months from now," he maintained. 
<H5>  Most for Norwegian "No" </H5>
  When the Norwegian people wake up on 29 November, a good 
Kr150 million will have been spent in an attempt to convince Ola 
and Karl to vote -- and how to vote -- regarding Norway's 
membership of the European Union. 
  It will cost one half of this sum, a good Kr70 million, to 
hold the referendum in Norway. The rest will be gleefully spent 
by the "Yes" and "No" movements on their campaigns over the six 
months between now and the vote. 
  Today, Friday [27 May], the government will present its 
proposal on the EU. It will contain the date for the 
referendum, 27-28 November. The proposal will also suggest the 
state's contribution to the various groups of campaigners. This 
has been estimated at being as high as between Kr15 and 20 
million to be evenly distributed. 
  The "No" movement is the rich cousin from the countryside, 
whereas the three "Yes" groups are having a rough time of it 
with thin wallets. The farmers -- both privately and via their 
organizations -- are the largest contributors. Recently every 
member of Norges Bondelag [Norwegian Farmers' Union] was asked 
to cough up Kr400. The money will virtually all go into the 
coffers of the "No" campaigners. In some counties [fylkar] the 
dairies are giving their employees time off to work for the "No" 
campaign, and the contributions of the 130,000 members have 
already been used up. 
  "Every county [fylke] (administrative province) has its own 
organization which receives its own money from regional 
contributors. It is hard to estimate what that will produce. 
Our campaign is costing us approximately Kr40 to 50 million, 
including the funds provided by the state. We have around 
Kr18.5 million saved up," said Kjell Erik Kallset, the 
information chief of the "No to the EU" movement. 
  "We are hoping to drum up a total of Kr30 million, one third 
of which will come from the state, another one third from the 
NHO [Norwegian Employers' Organization], and the rest from other 
contributors," said Frank Rossavik, speaking on behalf of the 
three "Yes" groups. 
<H5>  Swedish SAF Campaign </H5>
  In Sweden, the "Yes" and "No" campaigns for the referendum 
on 
the EU will cost considerably more than in the other countries, 
and even more than the information campaigns associated with the 
referendum on nuclear power did -- where the information costs 
totalled approximately Kr98 million. By the time of the 
referendum on 13 November, the "Yes" and "No" campaigners will 
have spent a little more than Kr100 million of state money. On 
top of this comes the contribution to the "Yes" campaigners from 
the SAF and the business sector, for which the figure of Kr200 
million has been mentioned. 
  According to the proposal that has just been tabled, the 
state will hand out Kr60 million in direct information funds. 
Other state funds for information purposes include the Falldin 
delegation, which has so far distributed Kr50 million in general 
information resources.

  [Text] The steering committee of the Qualification 
Commission, set up after the failure of the European Ariane 
rocket in January, has given the go-ahead to the resumption of 
flights and confirmed the launch of an Ariane rocket on 
Saturday, 4 June. After a four-month interruption, the 64th 
Ariane is scheduled for launch this Saturday at 0402 (0902 Paris 
time [0702 GMT]) from the Guiana Space Center in Kourou. It 
will carry three satellites: Intelsat- 702, the second of the 
Intelsat-VII series of the international communications 
satellite organization Intelsat, and two scientific 
microsatellites of the British Defense Ministry, the STRV-1A and 
STRV-1B. As a result of the 24 January Ariane failure, which 
was caused by a problem in the turbopump which has now been 
solved, two telecommunications satellites were lost: Turksat-1A 
and Eutelsat-II-F5.

  [Text] The Ariane rocket which was expected to place three 
satellites into orbit at 0700 GMT today did not launch as 
scheduled from the Kourou base in Guyana. Bruno Rougier reports. 
  [Rougier] Ariane was not launched because the arm which was 
supposed to feed the rocket with hydrogen did not open. The 
rocket is held by two arms that open five seconds before launch. 
Unlike the hydrogen arm, the oxygen arm opened. The reason is 
still unknown, but there is one key thing I must emphasize: the 
launcher is not in danger at the moment. 
  Technicians are now busy cleaning the two tanks. The 
hydrogen tank will normally be emptied by the attached tube. As 
for the oxygen tank, a purification system will likely be used; 
this should take several hours. Following this technician 
should know why the arm failed to open. In addition, the 
launching system will be examined to replace some spare parts 
and repair some connections. Ariane Space management has refused 
to say when a new launch will take place. According to experts 
I met this morning, the delay could take a week.

<F P=106> [Michael Becket report: "Governor Spells Out Terms for </F>
Union"] 
  [Text] Monetary union Europe is being prevented by "the 
intolerably high level of unemployment throughout the European 
Union [EU] and the huge differentials between the levels of 
unemployment between the different members states," says Bank of 
England Governor Eddie George. 
  That is preventing the economic convergence of the 
countries, 
which is a pre-condition for a single currency, he said this 
weekend at the London conference of the Association Cambiste 
Internationale. 
  "Until much greater real economic convergence has been 
achieved, flexibility of nominal exchange rates may help to 
speed up the process of convergence." 
  But it will be a long time before sufficient and sustainable 
convergence of stable economies will permit such a monetary 
union, Mr George said. Fixed exchange rates are, however, not 
an alternative. Wide economic stability is the only process 
that will maintain steady exchange rates, he explained. 
  "Fiscal discipline, a reduction in the role of the public 
sector, often involving privatisation, internal and external 
liberalisation" are generally now agreed as sound policy. 
  "If we can't achieve greater internal stability as a matter 
of self-interest, then I am not at all sure that a nominal 
external anchor would necessarily be a more compelling general 
discipline."

<F P=106> [Report signed "d.n.": "SPOe Poll: 55 Percent for Entry"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- "It is a fact that 12 June is not yet in 
the bag." Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal 
Manager Josef Cap has announced a final offensive by his party 
before the referendum on Austria's entry into the European Union 
[EU] on Sunday [12 June]. According to a new SPOe poll, 35 
percent say they will "definitely" vote for entry, while 20 
percent say they would "most likely" vote yes. 
  Another view is seen if one asks about the attitude of 
relatives and acquaintances: 38 percent advocate it, while 27 
percent oppose. At a news conference on Friday, Cap reported on 
the results of an IFES [Institute for Empirical Social Research] 
telephone poll among 600 Austrians. Fifteen percent will 
"definitely" vote for entry. During this last phase, the SPOe 
will, above all, address women, because 24 percent of them (as 
compared to 47 percent of men) are definitely for EU membership. 
  Even 55 percent of the voters of the Freedom Party of 
Austria 
[FPOe] believe that Chairman Joerg Haider is not interested in 
Austria but rather in the strengthening of his position for the 
Nationalrat election. 
  The SPOe's arguments for the last week before the referendum 
are: Without the EU, tens of thousands of jobs will be lost, and 
Austria is "twice as safe" in the EU. Cap made the appeal that 
12 June should be "free from any domestic policy constraints." 
Austria's future is at stake, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Susanne Lintl: "Slovenia Is Banking on Austria's </F>
EU Membership"] 
  [Text] In Ljubljana, President Thomas Klestil has noted 
"great interest in 12 June," the day of European Union [EU] 
referendum in Austria. EU membership was the main topic of 
talks held by Klestil with his counterpart Milan Kucan at the 
beginning of his visit to Slovenia on Wednesday [1 June] 
morning. "President Kucan has indicated that this decision is 
not only of importance for Austria. We are bearing 
responsibility for the future course and fate of our neighboring 
states," Klestil concluded. The Slovene side expects and 
appreciates this responsibility. Klestil: "Milan Kucan said 
that it is good when a child has a godfather at its side -- as 
we are for the Slovenes." 
  President Klestil also voiced Austria's concerns about the 
Krcko nuclear power plant near the Austrian border. He was 
assured by Kucan that an early warning system for nuclear 
accidents would be installed between Vienna and Ljubljana. A 
group of experts is to work out the details of the agreement 
soon. 
  Regarding the minority rights of the ethnic Slovenes in 
Carinthia, which are laid down in Article 7 of the State Treaty, 
Klestil emphasized that he regarded the State Treaty as being 
fulfilled. "This, of course, does not mean that unsolved 
minority issues will be solved on the basis of goodneighborly 
relations." [as published] 
  In his talks with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, President 
Klestil, who is accompanied by Provincial Governors Josef 
Krainer and Christof Zernatto, discussed a railroad agreement 
between Austria and Slovenia. Vienna is mainly interested in 
extending the line from Graz to Maribor and Koper to establish 
an efficient link to the Adriatic coast. The 2.4-billion 
schilling agreement should be signed within the next few weeks.

<F P=106> [Report by Samo Kobenter: "Klestil: Austria Has </F>
Overfulfilled the State Treaty"] 
  [Text] Kopar -- On 12 June Austria will not only vote on 
its own integration into the European Union [EU], but on that of 
its neighboring country: This was the assessment of Austrian 
President Thomas Klestil at the conclusion of his visit, the 
first official visit of an Austrian President to Slovenia. At 
the concluding conference in the port of Kopar, Klestil said 
that he had noted with satisfaction that Slovenia's economic 
development has reached an impressive stability since the 
military conflict in 1991. 
  Klestil said that the most important success of his talks 
was 
an agreement on the improvement of the traffic infrastructure 
from Austria to the port of Kopar. In particular the railroad 
links with the Styrian border are to be expanded. In addition, 
the joint expansion of an early-warning system for the nuclear 
power plant of Krsko was agreed. As a sign of the joint 
dedication to helping Bosnia, Klestil handed his Slovene 
counterpart Milan Kucan 21 million schillings in financial aid. 
This money is to ensure schools, training, and food for one 
year for 10,000 Bosnian children, who fled to Slovenia. 
  Regarding the question of Austria's Slovene minority, 
Klestil 
pointed out that the corresponding Article 7 of the State Treaty 
has been fulfilled and that Austria's minority laws go beyond 
these stipulations. 
  President Kucan stressed his country's "great interest in 
and 
desire for" a positive outcome in the Austrian referendum. This 
desire is not based on altruistic interests, but on very 
egotistical interests, Kucan said. Slovenia wants to join the 
EU as quickly as possible and expects support from Austria. 
<H5>  Problems With Italy </H5>
  Concerning the latest developments in Italy, Kucan said that 
the participation of the neofascists in the government is 
arousing certain fears. However, the inviolability of the 
borders has been set down in the Helsinki agreements and the 
relations with his country have been defined in the Osimo 
treaties.

<F P=106> [Report by Bert Steingoetter: "Austrians as `Stasi' Agents: </F>
List of Suspects Growing!"] 
  [Excerpt] Whether Austrian Radio and Television (ORF) 
correspondent Fritz Wendl and another two Austrians, on whom 
investigations are currently being carried out in connection 
with suspected spying activities, have indeed supplied 
information to the former GDR is still uncertain. Yet, what is 
certain is that they will not be the last ones who -- whether 
guilty or not -- will be put on the "list." 
  A list in the Interior Ministry that is getting longer and 
longer. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV] is sending an officer to Vienna once every 
two to three months. In his luggage, this man has the most 
recent names or, in some cases, only bits and pieces of 
information of people suspected of having served the Stasi as 
informers in Austria. 
  This is where the Austrian State Protection officers come 
in. 
They have to clarify whether the suspects deliberately supplied 
an foreign power with information, maybe even in return for 
cash. Or, whether they were simply tricked by a professional 
agent, made friends with him, and unwittingly passed on 
information in a friendly conversation in a bar or restaurant. 
  Yet, a high-ranking State Protection officer has said that 
things might be even worse: "We know of cases of unsuspecting 
citizens who were even put on the Stasi payroll. This could 
happen when agents who are under pressure to provide results 
simply embellished their reports to headquarters about their 
private meeting with people in bars and restaurants -- and put 
the rewards for the alleged hot `source' in their own pocket."

<F P=106> [Report by Franz Resperger: "Warning: `PKK Attack on </F>
Vienna Regional Court'"] 
  [Text] Are Kurdish separatists planning a violent 
liberation of one of their fellow fighters who is in prison in 
Vienna? The Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] in 
Wiesbaden has warned the Austrian authorities of such an attack. 
The Vienna State Police are taking the appropriate precautions. 
The reason: On 7 June, Kurd Huseyin Karabulut, 28, will be on 
trial for attempted murder. 
  The BKA in Wiesbaden is not commenting on the matter. It has 
been informed about the sensitive trial of the Kurd in Vienna, 
but it cannot say anything about the planned liberation attempt. 
  Nevertheless, the police expect an attack because a German 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] reportedly revealed that the 
Kurd is supposed to be freed. 
  The background of the matter in brief: On 5 August 1990, a 
26-year-old Turk, Mahmut Yerli was shot down in Vienna's Seventh 
District. He was said to have been a member of the Turkish 
right-wing extremist organization Gray Wolves and its boss in 
Austria. Yerli survived the attack, even though he was shot 
twice in the stomach. 
  The next day, two suspects were discovered by the State 
Police: alleged PKK activist Huseyin Karbulut, 28, and his 
29-year-old brother Metin. Huseyin was arrested, and Metin 
managed to escape. He was later arrested in Wiesbaden. 
  Rudolf Mayer, the lawyer of the Kurd imprisoned in Vienna, 
is 
shocked by the rumors: "This is just intended to influence the 
jury. The massive attendance of the police at the trial is to 
give the impression that the defendant is a dangerous man." 
  In addition, Dr. Mayer believes that he will be able to 
prove 
that his client, who will be on trial for attempted murder on 7 
June, is innocent: "Huseyin did not shoot at all. The shot was 
fired behind him."

<F P=106> [Report signed "ho/has": "Economic Development Better Than </F>
Expected"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Industry is more optimistic about the 
future than the economic researchers: This year economic growth 
will easily reach the 2 percent that the experts have predicted. 
Even 2.5 percent is possible, Economic Chamber economist 
Christian Festa told a press conference yesterday, referring to 
a poll among 300 Austrian companies. The precondition for 
recovery is, however, membership in the European Union [EU]. 
  There are positive signals from various sides: Austria is in 
the "early stage of economic recovery," according to experts as 
well as the fact that orders received are rising. This tender 
seed of economic growth must, however, not be destroyed by new 
taxes and other burdens, Guenter Stummvoll, the secretary 
general of the Economic Chamber, stressed. Rather, the upward 
development is to be supported by more flexible work time. 
  The wave of bankruptcies is also declining: During the first 
five months of this year, the cost of bankruptcies reached about 
10 billion schillings. During the same period last year, the 
cost was almost twice as high. "We have to expect an easing of 
the situation regarding the number of bankruptcy proceedings 
opened and, above all, regarding the amount of the estimated 
debts," Klaus Herzenberger, head of the Loan Protection 
Association of 1870, says, being optimistic also for the further 
course of the year. 
  On the labor market the situation clearly improved at the 
end 
of May, far more than justified by the usual seasonal decline. 
The level of unemployment in Austria -- 4.5 percent -- is about 
half of that in the European OECD area as well as of the EU, 
which has an average unemployment rate of 11.2 percent. At the 
moment 194,287 unemployed are registered at the labor exchange 
offices, which is 6,943 fewer than at the end of May 1993 and 
25,765 fewer than in April. At the same time, the number of 
vacancies is rising: At the moment, there are 35,000 vacant 
jobs. That is 2,665 more than at the end of April.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tobback: `Flow of Refugees Seeking </F>
Asylum Gradually Under Control' -- Total Applications in May 
Under 1000 for First Time in Years"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Louis Tobback was both content and 
optimistic when assessing his own policy on asylum-seekers. 
Moreover, the minister, who is also responsible for alien 
affairs, offered some hard facts and figures to justify his 
buoyant mood: In May 1994, a total of 919 asylum requests were 
received, according to the latest figures released by the Alien 
Affairs Department. That is several hundred fewer requests than 
in previous months. Even greater is the difference between this 
figure and the one registered in June 1993, when the monthly 
record of 3,058 was set. Anyway, it was years ago that the 
number of asylum-seekers was last under the 1000 mark. This 
brings the sum total of asylum requests received over the first 
five months of this year to 1,105. Remember, the annual total in 
1993 amounted to 26,883, and the 1992 total was 17,647. "What 
is more, the latest figure released for May even includes around 
100 Rwandans," Tobback emphasized. The minister primarily 
attributes this success to his own firm asylum policy. Exactly 
one year ago, a new, faster asylum procedure was introduced 
which, among other things, did away with the possibility of 
appealing to the Council of State in the asylum request 
procedure. "However, it was not a question of tightening up the 
procedure, the sole aim was to limit and dissuade people from 
abusing the possibility of lodging an appeal." The candidate 
for mayor of Leuven also considered it to be of great importance 
to dissociate asylum-seeker status from eligibility for a work 
permit. [passage omitted] 
  What is the ultimate objective? "Not to set a world record 
for the lowest number of asylum requests," Tobback said, "but to 
reach a figure that is as close as possible to the number of 
people definitively recognized as political refugees." 
According to the statistics, ultimately something like 5 
percent of all asylum-seekers are recognized as refugees.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Claude Juncker, minister of finance, </F>
budget, and labor: "Dreams and Objectives"] 
  [Text] The hypothesis being advanced by growth fanatics 
that 3 percent growth is sufficient to overcome unemployment is 
not one with which we can go along. Unless there is strong 
growth, the labor market will not recover. However, an increase 
in growth alone will not be enough. 
  In addition, we partly rebuff the view -- widespread in 
employers' circles -- that only a radical reduction in wage 
costs might result in an increase of jobs. On 1 July, 
incidental labor costs will be reduced by 2 billion Luxembourg 
francs [LFr] a year. Reductions in taxes and incidental costs 
will mean a saving of LFr30 billion over the next five years, 
and taxes are not expected to rise. However, managing costs 
alone will not be enough either. 
  Strong economic growth and low incidental wage costs are the 
preconditions for preventing any further deterioration of the 
labor market. Consequently, only those parties with proven 
economic and financial competence may be allowed to come to 
power and form a government. Small parties with half-baked 
platforms and unrealistic concepts may enable irritated voters 
to vent their dissatisfaction, but if they come to power, our 
country will be worse off. 
  Economic growth and a healthy cost-related situation cannot 
stem the tide of unemployment by themselves. What is required 
in addition are complementary policies of the kind called for 
not only by the government, but by all the partners. 
  In the first instance, we must help existing labor market 
policy instruments to make speedy progress. There is no use in 
repeatedly adopting new laws and offering fresh forms of support 
for the labor market. We must make greater efforts to bring the 
broad-ranging series of instruments at our disposal into effect. 
We must be more efficient in informing employers about the 
forms of aid available to them when they hire unemployed 
individuals. In recent years -- and I say this quite 
self-critically -- the efforts made by the Ministry of Labor to 
provide such information were insufficient. 
  Many employers still do not know that they can apply for the 
reimbursement of their ancillary labor costs if they take on 
older, jobless individuals or the long-term unemployed. Many 
employers still do not know about state contributions to wages 
when they sign up young, unemployed people. 
  We shall make every conceivable effort to bring unemployed 
people in out of the cold. We will provide better information, 
but employers must also react more positively. Our unemployed 
should first be given a chance, before the labor markets in the 
border region have been emptied of their potential. 
  In order to give our unemployed greater opportunities, we 
will extend the offer of retraining and specialized training 
courses. At present 400 unemployed individuals are undergoing 
retraining. This figure must be increased. We shall see that it 
does. We will not tolerate seeing unemployed people turning a 
deaf ear to this extended offer. 
  However, we must also go down new avenues. Part-time work 
needs a considerable shot in the arm. When full-time jobs are 
shared new employment opportunities are created. We must be 
open to all kinds of part-time work: half-time work, the 
four-day workweek, the six-hour day, the eight-month working 
year, etc. Many people here in our country are waiting for 
offers of part-time work. Employers must create them, and the 
trade unions must include them in their lists of demands. The 
state must help part-time work -- and not just half-time work -- 
to make a breakthrough in all sectors of public service. 
  Remote working [Tele-Arbeit] and distance working 
[Fernarbeit] -- i.e. working at home -- must gain a foothold in 
our economic system, for it gives employees, especially parents 
bringing up their children, the chance to go about their work 
within their own four walls. It also enables employees in rural 
areas to overcome the mobility barrier. We will award distance 
work fiscally and protect it under labor law against abuse. 
  Moving into new territory also means that we have to provide 
the labor market with the satisfaction of modern requirements. 
Jobs, new jobs are everywhere: Employment opportunities in the 
socially relevant fields of care for the elderly, neighbor 
support, child care, and recreational activity have been 
unnoticed for years 
  Moving into new territory also means securing work for those 
who gain no professional qualifications, in spite of all the 
school reforms. For decades we have been replacing people by 
robots. In so doing, we have pulled the carpet from underneath 
the feet of the nonqualified worker. We must gradually start 
replacing robots with people who need work, thereby putting them 
back on their feet again. 
  We will certainly not manage to restore full employment by 
the end of the decade. As desirable as this objective of work 
for all may be, it will remain an unfulfilled dream. However, 
our concern for people and respect for their dignity obliges us 
all to work untiringly toward this goal. 
  All our concerns are important, but none is as important as 
this one.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the Socialist Workers' Party of </F>
Luxembourg: "LSAP/CFGP Meeting -- Toward an Efficient Civil 
Service"] 
  [Text] A delegation of the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party 
of Luxembourg] (comprising Deputy Prime Minister J.F. Poos, 
Party Chairman B. Fayot, Group Chairman J. Asselborn, 
Representative M. Zanussi, R. Hencks, and Group Secretary O. 
Mores) met with representatives of the CGFP [General 
Confederation of the Civil Service, the national association of 
government-employed people] (namely, First Deputy President P. 
Trausch, General Secretary J. Daleiden, and Financial 
Administrator F. Haas) on 25 May. 
  The main topics discussed, with a view to the LSAP election 
platform and the ideas of the CGFP program, were the role of the 
civil service in a modern state, the possible introduction of 
hospital insurance, the future orientation of pension systems, 
the 1991 tax reform, the latest tripartite measures, and the 
process of European integration. 
  The LSAP and the CGFP are convinced there is no alternative 
to the existing system of civil servants. In the future, on the 
basis of a transparent recruitment and pay policy, these civil 
servants should strive to achieve the highest level of 
competence, efficiency, and effectiveness. In this context, the 
LSAP expressly called for the preservation of civil servant 
status. 
  In addition, the two delegations discussed the recently 
adopted tripartite measures aimed at fighting unemployment and 
inflation. The LSAP and CGFP regard the Luxembourg indexation 
system as a tried and tested instrument for conserving 
purchasing power and an important contribution toward 
guaranteeing social peace. The instrument in question must 
therefore be fully safeguarded. 
  As regards European policy, both delegations emphasized the 
need for a democratic and social Europe. Moreover, they said 
that European integration would have to be improved, in 
compliance with Luxembourg's interests and national 
peculiarities; that enlargement of the European Union would have 
to proceed in a well-thought-out manner; and that preparations 
for the intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996 should 
include all the relevant forces involved.

  [Text] The Netherlands is prepared to contribute a million 
dollars to a salvage operation for the Russian nuclear submarine 
Komsomolets in order to prevent an ecological disaster. The 
Komsomolets sank five years ago in the Barents Sea. It is 
rusting so quickly that there is a danger of plutonium being 
released from the wreckage this year. 
  The Netherlands has already had extensive talks with Russia 
about the nature and the costs of a salvage operation. If the 
two countries agree, the Dutch salvage companies Smit 
Internationale and Heerema Offshore will both be involved in the 
operation.

  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in a wet and 
windy Britain today as he continued his D-Day trip to Europe. 
The President and First Lady were met by John Major and his wife 
Norma after landing at RAF [Royal Air Force base] Mildenhall, 
Suffolk. Mr Clinton will attend a remembrance service at the 
American Military Cemetery in Madingley, near Cambridge, later 
today. 
  During his stay in Britain -- his first since he became 
President -- Mr Clinton will have talks with the Prime Minister 
at Chequers and also meet acting Labour leader Margaret Beckett 
at Hartwell House, near Aylesbury, Bucks. Tonight Mr Clinton 
and his wife Hillary will attend a State dinner in Portsmouth as 
guests of the Queen. Tomorrow they will meet U.S. D-Day 
veterans and then watch an international flotilla before going 
to Normandy. 
  Mr Clinton, the first post-war U.S. commander-in-chief 
without military experience, returns from France on Wednesday [8 
June] for a nostalgic visit to Oxford University where he will 
receive an honorary doctorate. 
  He spent a year at University College as a Rhodes scholar in 
the late 1960's.

<F P=106> [George Jones article: "Howard Hits at Delors Drive for </F>
Superstate"] 
  [Text] The sceptical tone of the Conservative 
Euro-election campaign was intensified last night with an attack 
by Mr Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, on M Jacques Delors, 
the President of the EC Commission, for attempting to undermine 
national independence. 
  Emphasising Britain's sense of national identity and its 
pride in institutions such as the Monarchy and Parliament, Mr 
Howard said EC leaders ignored popular feeling at their peril. 
  He singled out M Delors who steps down as president of the 
Commission at the end of this year, for suggesting recently that 
those who opposed federalism were encouraging racism and were 
anti-European. 
  "It is those who wish to impose a European superstate over 
the heads of the people of Europe, those who are obsessed with 
their federalist mission, who risk stimulating a revival of 
nationalist extremism," Mr Howard told a Tory campaign meeting 
in his constituency at Hythe, Kent. 
  His tone was reminiscent of Mrs Thatcher's landmark speech 
at 
Bruges in 1988 when she gave a warning against the creation of a 
"United States of Europe." 
  Mr Howard, a Cabinet Euro-sceptic, warmly welcomed Mr John 
Major's call earlier this week for a multi-speed, multi-layered 
Europe, in which member states could do some things in their own 
way and at their own speed. 
  "What we need is a made-to-measure Europe in which the 
institutional arrangements comfortably fit national interests, 
not an off-the-peg standard-size Europe, ill-fitting and 
splintering at the seams," he said. 
  There were some basic, unchanging requirements of the 
European Union: an acceptance of the single market in goods and 
services, free movement of citizens of member states to live and 
work throughout the Community, and the need for common 
institutions to make decisions and see they were enforced. 
  "Beyond these basic principles there is no need why all 
states should move together or at the same speed and good 
reasons why they might choose not to do so," he said. 
  Earlier this week, Lord Tebbit, the arch-Euro-sceptic, 
welcomed Mr Major's speech as evidence that the Government was 
coming round to the viewpoint of the anti-Maastricht rebels. 
  Mr Howard's speech is a further indication that the Cabinet 
is adopting an increasingly sceptical approach in an attempt to 
persuade core Tory supporters to vote on Thursday [9 June]. 
  Mr Howard said the real debate was not about Britain's 
membership, but about the future of the EC. 
  He emphasised that he wanted to see a free-trading Europe of 
nation states. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, he said, 
wanted a "one-way ticket on the federal express to a European 
superstate."

<F P=106> [Interview with Dmitriy Trenin, political scientist and </F>
Russian military officer, by Dieter Wulf; place and date not 
given: "No Reason To Fear Russia"] 
  [Text] [Wulf] What form could partner-like cooperation 
between Russia and NATO assume? 
  [Trenin] In general, the Russian Government is prepared to 
sign the framework agreement on a Partnership for Peace treaty. 
However, it wants an improvement in the consultation mechanisms, 
especially following the experiences the Russians have had with 
NATO regarding the dispute between the Serbs and Bosnians over 
Gorazde. If one concludes a partnership agreement, the partners 
should also consider mutual interests. If, for example, the 
Russian military believed that it had to act in the Caucasus, 
then they should consult NATO beforehand. Of course, things 
must function the other way around as well. 
  [Wulf] In the Russian military doctrine that was approved a 
few months ago, there is no mention at all of renouncing first 
use of nuclear weapons. Does this mean that Western Europe 
faces a nuclear threat once again? 
  [Trenin] In 1987, Gorbachev renounced first use of nuclear 
weapons, but provided no guarantees. I think that the present 
concepts are more realistic. Nuclear weapons solely serve a 
deterrence function. In conventional terms, Russia is much 
weaker today, and that causes concern among our military. We 
are living in a time of great uncertainty, and if conventional 
capacity is drastically reduced, that automatically enhances the 
value of nuclear components. 
  [Wulf] Would you not agree that there are dangers, such as 
the ultra right-wing politician Zhirinovskiy, that justify a 
fear of Russia? 
  [Trenin] I personally consider Zhirinovskiy to be a 
political clown. Zhirinovskiy himself is less of a danger than 
some of his supporters in parliament who are considered 
respectable now. We should not do these people a favor by 
reviving the old myths about Russian imperialism. At the 
moment, I see no reason why Russia should be considered a threat 
to Europe. 
  [Wulf] The farewell ceremony to mark the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Germany is a sensitive issue at the present 
time. What do the Russians think about that. 
  [Trenin] To the regular soldiers, it does not matter at all 
whether the farewell ceremony takes place in Weimar or in 
Berlin. What is of greater concern to them is that the military 
leadership is finding it increasingly difficult to find 
accommodation for the troops returning to Russia. However, the 
farewell question is, of course, a very important political 
symbol for the military and political leadership. If the 
feeling is created that Russia has no friends in the West, that 
will certainly not be in Germany's interest. 
  [Wulf] Does that mean that the new option that has been 
agreed with Yeltsin will send the right signals? 
  [Trenin] The current option is very positive, but it is 
still very far removed from the Russians' original expectations. 
I can fully understand why the Russian troops should not take 
part in joint ceremony with the Western allies. Nevertheless, 
the Germans should consider the political consequences of that.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Russians Leave Behind `Criminal </F>
Bridgehead'"] 
  [Excerpts] Frankfurt/Main -- Even after the complete 
withdrawal of the Western Group of the Red Army from Germany, 
the criminal structures built up by leading military personnel 
of the Russian Armed Forces will continue to exist. This is the 
conclusion drawn by German security authorities. 
  In an analysis of East European criminal organizations, the 
German authorities speak of "firmly established bridgeheads of 
organized crime," whose "business will continue to thrive." The 
German authorities have found that, as far as personnel and 
logistics are concerned, these structures will be preserved as a 
result of many years of criminal cooperation between members of 
the Western Group and exiled Russian and Georgian criminals. 
The criminal machinations, which are controlled by leading 
military personnel -- including numerous generals -- have 
meanwhile also become a matter of investigations in Moscow. 
Yuriy Boldyrev, the former head of the control administration 
of the Russian president, accused "leading personnel of the 
trade administration of the Western Group" of having transferred 
17 million German marks [DM] to bank accounts in the United 
States, Switzerland, and Finland. Moreover, DM48 million were 
granted in bank guarantees, without any reason, to 13 foreign 
companies. At least three enterprises that have connections 
with the Western Group used these guarantees to withdraw DM13 
million from the trade administration's clearing account without 
supplying any goods. [passage omitted] 
  One of the most important trade partners of the Western 
Group 
is an agent in Antwerp with an estimated annual turnover of DM2 
billion. Police suspect that the heads of the company are 
involved in the international narcotics business and have close 
connections with the Russian mafia in Germany and the United 
States.

  [Excerpt] Brandenburg (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl [Christian Democratic Union -- CDU] today affirmed 
his vision of "flourishing scenes" in the five new laender. At 
a CDU election campaign rally in Brandenburg, Kohl said that his 
prediction of five years [for the eastern laender to catch up 
with the west] could perhaps stretch to "seven or eight, but 
basically I have not been mistaken." At the same time the 
chancellor called for more tolerance between west and east 
Germans, since the people in the two parts of Germany had gone 
through different developments in the past 40 years. 
  In his speech, which was disrupted repeatedly by applause 
and 
whistling, Kohl said that safeguarding peace and freedom and 
fighting mass unemployment were the most important objectives of 
European unification. Kohl also called for joint European 
efforts to solve the asylum problem and combat international 
crime. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Chairman Klaus Kinkel has today, as expected, proposed to the 
federal party conference of the Free Democrats in Rostock that 
the Bonn Government coalition with the Union [CDU/CSU] be 
continued after the general election on 16 October. Kinkel 
stressed that the party conference should "send out" this signal 
"to all parts of the country." The FDP, "on the basis of its 
liberal program," intends "to continue the successful coalition 
with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period." 
  The party conference is to vote on this proposal this 
afternoon. Kinkel expects that an overwhelming majority of the 
approximately 660 delegates will vote in favor. 
  The FDP chairman pointed out that the election program of 
the 
Free Democrats would be adopted by the Rostock party conference. 
He emphasized that this will give a distinctive stamp to the 
FDP. At the same time, Kinkel warned against a red-green or a 
grand coalition in Bonn. A strong FDP would be the guarantee 
that this would not happen and that "common sense" would 
continue to govern for the benefit of the country. 
  [Berlin DDP/ADN in German at 1323 GMT on 3 June adds the 
following: "Rostock (DDP/ADN) -- The FDP national party 
conference has voted by a great majority in favor of continuing 
the Bonn coalition with the CDU/CSU after the general election 
on 16 October. The approximately 660 delegates in Rostock today 
voted in favor of a proposal to that effect by the party 
leadership."]

this morning approved its electoral program for the Bundestag 
election in October. In it, the liberals are recommending 
themselves to the voters as the party of achievement and 
committed defenders of the market economy. At the same time, 
the FDP deliberately took a position of liberal independence 
from its CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union] coalition partner in the areas of domestic and social 
policy and foreigners' affairs. 
  The vast majority of the delegates voted in Rostock for the 
program; three voted against and there were three abstentions.

  [Excerpt] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] leader, Rudolf Scharping, does not rule out a 
coalition with the liberals [Free Democratic Party] after the 
Bundestag election, even after the FDP decided at its party 
conference in favor of a coalition with the CDU/CSU Union. The 
FDP had "not said that if the Union had a poor election result, 
it would go into opposition," Scharping told BILD AM SONNTAG 
newspaper. On the eve of the elections, the "supply of partners 
will be greater than the demand." 
  At the same time, he once again rejected the idea of a grand 
coalition. The goal of the Social Democrats was to become the 
strongest party: "We will always find a partner in that event," 
Scharping added. "Exclusive rights for small parties" could not 
be arranged with him. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Nahrendorf: "Campaign Help of a Very </F>
Special Kind--Elder Statesman Helmut Schmidt Plunges the SPD 
Into an Awkward Situation With His Recommendations"] 
  [Text] With his latest book, Das Jahr der 
Entscheidung (published by Rowohlt, Berlin), Helmut Schmidt 
entered the arena of the campaign. He is endorsing a power 
change in Germany and recommends Rudolf Scharping as an unspent 
force. But the support given by the elder statesman has caused 
no real joy among the Social Democrats. With his 19 
recommendations for the future Federal Government, Helmut 
Schmidt at the same time provided the Union parties [CDU 
(Christian Democratic Union)/CSU (Christian Social Union)] with 
ammunition for its campaign guns. 
  Helmut Schmidt, who is disturbed by the dangerous desire to 
get fed up with political parties in Germany, reminds us that 
"all of us together must curb our disappointments and our 
bitterness." But he has difficulties suppressing his own 
bitterness. It is directed above all at Helmut Kohl. To be sure, 
Schmidt does not deny the contributions that his successor as 
chancellor made toward German unity, but he does give him bad 
marks for catastrophic mistakes made during the unification 
process, and he warns in vivid terms against an extension of 
Helmut Kohl's tenure as chancellor. 
<H5>  Key Personnel Are the Most Important </H5>
  In getting even with Kohl and the "exhausted CDU/CSU," 
Schmidt's political passion flares up, but his support for 
Scharping remains typically cool. "What we need today at the 
head of our government is an unspent force. We have it in Rudolf 
Scharping. This is a man who learned to govern as chief of state 
of the Rhineland-Palatinate, and who demonstrated there what he 
is capable of. He is surrounded by capable women and men. They 
will approach the task together with fresh energy." In a year of 
decision, many Social Democrats would have wished the praise for 
the candidate to have been somewhat stronger. 
  This all the more since Helmut Schmidt realizes that 
programs 
are for the most part not worth very much later on in the 
reality of government. What is more important are the actual 
economic and social conditions for which the politicians have to 
take responsibility and with which they would see themselves 
confronted if they take over the government. Most important, 
however, are the key personnel, especially in the German 
television industry. 
  Helmut Schmidt's opinion of the second man in the Social 
Democratic campaign team is cool and objective: "Oskar 
Lafontaine did not study economics; instead, he is basically a 
natural scientist; his powers of comprehension, eloquence, and 
ability to assert himself, are similar to those of Franz Josef 
Strauss, who likewise had not studied economics but was 
nevertheless also a good finance minister. One could conceive of 
Lafontaine's filling this same office in similar fashion." 
  There is a reason for the acceptance of Oskar Lafontaine as 
a 
possible finance minister: Lafontaine is the highest political 
figure in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] who, for 
the most, part shares Helmut Schmidt's economic views and is 
trying to implement these within the party. And yet there will 
never again be a normal relationship between Lafontaine and 
Schmidt. Helmut Schmidt did not support SPD chancellor candidate 
Lafontaine during the campaign in 1990. Instead, in an 
unauthorized, but at the same time not denied, interview with 
the Rotterdam newspaper ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD, he even went so far as 
to say that Lafontaine would lose the Bundestag election and 
also deserved to lose. He did not forgive Lafontaine his 
publicized reflections, with Schmidt in mind, about secondary 
virtues, virtues with which one could also run a concentration 
camp. 
  The unspent political forces that Helmut Schmidt praises 
have 
a difficult time with his 19 recommendations for a future 
Federal Government. On balance, the recommendations, most of 
which might have been taken from the report of experts or from 
the expertise of the economics institutes, are anything but a 
convincing appeal for change. Helmut Schmidt cautions strongly 
against further tax burdens, e.g. an increase of indirect taxes 
such as the value-added tax or the tax on petroleum products, or 
of the income tax "for higher income groups." Schmidt: "Anyone 
who aims his sights only at high incomes and assets must ask 
himself if he wants to trigger still more shifts [of assets] to 
Monaco, Luxemburg, and other tax refuge countries." 
<H5>  For Less Welfare Services </H5>
  He warns: "An ecologically oriented change of our taxation 
system must take place in stages. It cannot be a positive factor 
in overcoming the serious acute affliction of our economy." And 
he also points to the contradiction: If an ecological tax does 
its job and does, in fact, bring about an environmentally 
friendly conduct on the part of manufacturers and consumers, it 
will generate no additional revenues. But if the ecological tax 
does not result in any additional tax revenues, it will not be 
possible to lower any other taxes. 
  He calls on the state not only to take more drastic action 
against [unreported] moonlighting, but also to insure that there 
is an adequate difference between social welfare services, on 
the one hand, and the regular lower incomes, on the other--and 
by no means to do this through raising the lower income groups. 
He supports a more rigorous interpretation of the reasonableness 
of a job [offer] and gives his opinion on the second labor 
market as follows: "For the long haul, the employment societies 
created by the state in Germany's eastern part and the whole 
so-called second labor market are not a suitable instrument." 
  In addition, his appeal for a greater spread in earnings 
will 
no doubt be opposed by the labor unions and by many Social 
Democrats: "Especially in commerce, in the crafts, and in 
services and office jobs of all types, in the large sector in 
which more than two-thirds of all gainfully employed persons 
work, in other words, many jobs have been lost as a result of 
excessively elevating the lower earnings groups. Also the 
simpler jobs will be needed again in the future." 
  In the closing chapter of his book, Helmut Schmidt, a 
proponent of a majority-vote system patterned on the British 
example, discusses the party-political structure of a "fresh 
government." Helmut Schmidt does not endorse another grand 
coalition of SPD and the Union--although he credits the grand 
coalition which governed from 1966 to 1969 with a remarkably 
good practical performance during the first two years of its 
existence. Such a grand coalition could come to pass, however, 
if the voting is highly fragmented. Whoever wants to avoid a 
grand coalition, thus his election credo, must vote for one of 
the two populist parties, the SPD or CDU/CSU. His personal wish 
is for a majority formed by one populist party together with one 
smaller coalition partner. 
<H5>  Aloof Vis-a-vis the FDP </H5>
  Vis-a-vis the FDP [Free Democratic Party], which he wanted 
to 
"rake away" in the 1982 election in Hessen, he maintains a 
position of detachment. He does, however, unlike the Greens, 
credit it sight unseen with a capability to govern at the 
federal level. However, contrary to his estimate, the FDP has 
already firmly committed itself to a coalition with the CDU/CSU. 
  Unless it breaks its word, it can therefore no longer be 
viewed as a partner for Scharping. Taking the Schmidt formula 
(one populist party and only one coalition partner) as the 
basis, this would leave the Greens as a partner. 
  Helmut Schmidt has no serious misgivings about realo-Greens 
such as Joschka Fischer, but he adds: "The critical factor is 
whether the Greens will be able to struggle through to a 
realistic overall political concept, including domestic and 
foreign policy, and above all including the economic questions." 
  Helmut Schmidt's coalition recommendations leave a feeling 
of 
perplexity within a party leadership which has thus far turned a 
deaf ear to the passionate courtship of the Greens. Thus far, 
Rudolf Scharping has not discovered a realistic overall 
political concept among the Greens. Helmut Schmidt may have 
meant well with his campaign help, but whether it will do the 
SPD any good will be decided by the voters on 16 October.

<F P=106> ["hjh" report: "Kanther To Check Constitutional Faith of </F>
Republikaner; Right-Wing Radical Party Excluded From Landtag 
Election"] 
  [Text] Following the banning of the Republikaner from the 
Saxony-Anhalt Landtag elections on 26 June, there are increasing 
calls for stricter state sanctions against this radical 
right-wing party. CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD 
[Social Democratic Party of Germany] politicians have agreed to 
petition Interior Minister Kanther to check whether the conduct 
of the Republikaner conforms to the Constitution. Nevertheless, 
calls for a ban on the Republikaner are controversial. Rudolf 
Krause, chairman of the Republikaner in Saxony-Anhalt, refuses 
to accept his party's exclusion. An objection can only be 
considered after the elections. Should the objection be 
granted, the election result would have to be declared void. 
  At a meeting on Wednesday [1 June], the Landtag Election 
Committee of Saxony-Anhalt decided by four votes to three to 
exclude the Republikaner from the elections. The reason it gave 
was irregular procedures when formulating the election list. 
Several Republikaner members had complained about the fact that 
the choice of Halle as location for the party's candidate 
nomination congress in March had been kept secret, as a result 
of which they could not attend this congress. Even so, Paul-Uwe 
Soeker, election manager for Saxony-Anhalt, recommended that the 
Republikaner be permitted to run in the elections, saying that 
similar procedures for drawing up election lists had been 
approved in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. Rudolf Krause, 
land chairman of the Republikaner, described his party's 
exclusion as a "dagger thrust against democracy" and announced 
judicial measures. Soeker said on Thursday evening that he 
would ask the Landtag Election Committee to reconsider its 
decision. 
  Meanwhile, there were increasing calls from the Bonn 
factions 
to deal with the Republikaner more harshly. Horst Eylmann 
(CDU), head of the Bundestag Legal Committee, said he has 
serious doubts whether the Repubikaner are a democratic party. 
Eylmann referred to the latest resignations and accusations 
among the party leadership, as well as the findings of the 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV]. If it 
transpires that the Republikaner have tolerated acts of violence 
or even actively supported them, that will be the right time to 
file an application to ban the party, said Eylmann. Ulrich 
Maier, the man responsible for domestic policy among SPD 
chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping's election staff, said 
that placing the Republikaner in the category of a right-wing 
extremist party is long overdue. Party chairman Schoenhuber's 
image is "similar that to the National Socialist Democratic 
Workers' Party," said Maurer. Nevertheless, he opposed a ban on 
the party because the necessary process might take many years. 
Johannes Gerster, acting chairman of the CDU/CSU Bundestag 
group, also said that a ban would make little sense. A lot of 
time would pass before the Constitutional Court decided to 
impose a ban, and until then the Republikaner might develop an 
image as martyrs. SPD politician Peter Glotz said that a ban 
might be legally possible, but would not serve anyone's 
interests. Both Gerster and Glotz said that the Repubikaner 
should be combated by political means. 
  According to the BfV, there is a "series of legally valid 
criteria" suggesting that the Republikaner are developing into a 
extremist right-wing party. Ernst Uhrlau, chief of the Hamburg 
BFV, said in SAARLAENDISCHER RUNDFUNK that the Republikaner had 
expressed "subdued pleasure" with acts of violence, particularly 
in 1991 and 1992. "A hatred of foreigners and anti-Semitism are 
expressed quite openly and extolled in smaller circles," he 
said. "The Republikaner and other right-wing extremist groups 
consider themselves a national political camp." 
  Republikaner chief Franz Schoenhuber denied that he had 
called for a "hunt to seek out and destroy fractious party 
members." This accusation had been expressed by Udo Boesch, 
head of the Republikaner federal organization, who quit this 
week. Boesch spoke of threats against his person and against 
Martina Rosenberger, federal secretary of the party, who also 
quit this week. Both Boesch and Rosenberger attribute their 
resignations to the Republikaner's increasingly extremist way of 
thinking and to Schoenhuber's dictatorial style of leadership.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  New Hamburg Party's Sluggish Growth </H8>
  The success of the Statt [Instead] Party in the Hamburg 
election in September 1993 "stunned the established parties made 
insecure by voter disaffection with politics," but has not 
carried through in recent party efforts to broaden its 
geographic base, according to an article in the 10 May 
HANDELSBLATT. While local organizations have been established 
in six laender, the party's national board refused to recognize 
Brandenburg and Saarland groups, and establishment of a Berlin 
organization was deferred. The HANDELSBLATT article noted that 
the party's constituent congress in North Rhine-Westphalia made 
an "awkward impression." During the session, party founder 
Markus Wegner and national chairman Bernd Schuenemann attacked 
one another on the stage. In the heated debate, Schuenemann, a 
professor of criminal law and the philosophy of law in Munich 
who was elected in March, called Wegner a member of a "cadre 
party." In the ensuing raucous scene, they even came to blows. 
The 19 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that six members of 
the national board relieved Schuenemann of his office on 17 May, 
citing the serious damage he had done the party, his intentional 
violation of party regulations, and his failure to observe 
conventions of democracy. The article speculated that a similar 
party fate awaits the Thuringian party chairman, von Bogendorff, 
and that the Bavarian party organization finances are to be 
examined for irregularities. 
  The rancor of the rivals seems exacerbated by the party's 
seeming lack of a platform, though in 1993 it did present a 
statement of principles, which was cited in the HANDELSBLATT 
article: "The demands were above all: not to spend more than was 
collected, to meet costs through higher efficiency, to examine 
government operations with an eye to privatization consistent 
with social policy, to postpone and extend payment schedules for 
planned investments." The article further noted the party's 
economic policy of promoting small- and medium-sized businesses 
and of technology to create and preserve jobs and to offset the 
risky economic status of Hamburg's port. These views, peculiar 
to the party's caucus in the Hamburg senate, are less clear 
among more recently formed party groups such as those in 
Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, and Baden-Wuerttemberg, which do not 
hold legislative office. The article asserted: "The newcomers' 
program is vague, if existent at all: liberal, conservative, and 
`grass-roots democratic' positions alternate; market economy 
tendencies on the one hand and ecologically oriented demands on 
the other only rarely seem attuned to one another." 
  The next nationwide meeting of the Statt Party organization 
is scheduled for 4 June in Hamburg. It will tackle the question 
of how many legitimate local party organizations there are, how 
many authorized board members there may be, how much the party 
may have been strengthened by a shrinking core membership, "and 
perhaps, how many genuine Statt parties really exist." A 9 May 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE article questioned whether so late a 
meeting can restore the party's potential for conducting an 
effective campaign for the European Parliament election on 12 
June, or whether that possibility was shattered by the debacle 
in North Rhine-Westphalia. 
<H5>  Opposition to Maastricht Shakey </H5>
  Another recently founded party, the Union of Free Citizens 
[BFB], is also among the 23 parties authorized to post 
candidates for the European Parliament election. Barely five 
months old, the party is also drawing up a platform for the 
federal elections in October, with special emphasis on economic 
and financial policy. In contrast to the Statt Party, however, 
as noted in the 13-14 May HANDELSBLATT, "the membership rolls in 
the laender organizations usually carry only a few names..." and 
the BFB's geographic distribution makes it "a predominantly 
southern German phenomenon," whereas the Statt Party membership 
is primarily in the north. The BFB, however, numbers only about 
420 members, according to an article in the 20 May FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE, and according to public opinion polling institutes, 
support for the "liberal-conservative reform party" is currently 
so slight that it cannot be measured. Personal clashes within 
the BFB are impeding its expansion, as with the Statt Party, and 
some founding members take exception to recent political 
maneuvers by the party chairman, Manfred Brunner. Brunner has 
developed contacts with the Bavarian Christian Social Union 
[CSU], a party rather to the right of the liberal founders of 
the BFB, and has associated with Joerg Haider, the chairman of 
Austria's Liberal Party [FP0e], who is generally conceded to be 
on the extreme right of the political spectrum. 
  According to the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, the BFB's 
"Guidelines for European Policy" seem less pro-German than 
anti-European Union [EU]: the party is in favor of preserving 
the German mark as currency, rather than falling victim to the 
"Esperanto money," as the Munich CSU chairman, Peter Gauweiler 
called the ECU. The party "also intends to guard against `the 
regulatory mania' of the EU; the joint agricultural policy ought 
to yield to simultaneous supports dictated by operations, and in 
questions of environmental protection, the EU ought to confine 
itself to what is absolutely essential." Whether the party 
properly describes itself as the "champion of German interests," 
by virtue of its concept of a European policy at odds with the 
Maastricht Treaty, or whether it is viewed as a nationalist 
group moving ever further to the right, even the chairman's old 
friends and supporters are leaving the party and questioning his 
judgment.

<F P=106> [`mes' report: "Ministers To Move to Old Berlin Buildings"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The government has agreed that most federal 
ministries will occupy existing old buildings when they move to 
Berlin. This will permit saving about two-thirds of the 
1.5-billion-marks [DM] savings called for by the Bundestag 
Budget Committee, said Irmgard Schwaetzer, minister for housing 
and city planning, in Bonn. On Wednesday [1 June], the cabinet 
approved an "accommodation concept" which, apart from a complete 
reconstruction of the Reichstag, only envisages the construction 
of a new Chancellery and Foreign Office. 
  Whereas the intention until now was to accommodate some 
two-thirds of the federal ministries in old buildings in Berlin, 
almost 90 percent of the ministries will be thus accommodated, 
according to the new plan. The government believes that the 
resulting savings will amount to about DM980 million. The 
Budget Committee had called for savings of 1.5 billion, so that 
the total cost of the move to Berlin does not excceed DM20 
billion. The move is supposed to begin in 1998, but the exact 
date depends on when the reconstruction of the Reichstag, the 
Bundestag's new home, will be completed. 
  There is no doubt that a new Chancellery will be built on 
the 
bend of the Spree River, close to the Reichstag. On the other 
hand, the Foreign Office must do without a completely new home 
for the time being. The cabinet decided that the Foreign 
Ministry will only occupy part of a new building, and that most 
of it will he split up among existing buildings. 
  As for the other ministries due to move to Berlin, there 
will 
be a general refurbishment of the buildings they are due to 
occupy there. Thus, previous plans to build new buildings for 
the Justice and Finance Ministries have been canceled. Also 
abrogated is the plan to build the "Hexagon," which was supposed 
to accommodate representations of those government departments 
remaining in Bonn. 
  The new concept approved by the Cabinet will now be placed 
before the Budget Committee and the Joint Financial Committee of 
the Federal Government and Berlin Senat. Berlin Mayor Eberhard 
Diepgen welcomed the government's decision, saying that the 
schedule for the government's and parliament's move to Berlin 
could now be kept. "Costs and space requirements are now geared 
to needs" he said.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- The welfare state has reached 
the limits of its capacity, according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
The future of Germany cannot be dealt with using the principles 
of "a leisure park," Kohl said today addressing the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democrat Union/Christian Social Union] industrial 
committee in Munich. 
  The CDU leader announced a "tough austerity course" for 
1995. 
The watchword in the future must be "rethinking, not 
redistribution." Kohl said that the cornerstones of the tax 
program for the next period in office are to be submitted in the 
near future. Under this program, a cut in business tax is 
proposed to protect Germany as an investment location. 
  In view of the increasing competition on world markets, the 
German economy can no longer allow itself to stay in second-last 
place among the EU countries in terms of machinery utilization 
times, Kohl said. The chancellor noted "encouraging signs" in 
the progress of the economy despite the existing problems. He 
highlighted the recent "sensible wage agreements," the cuts in 
key interest rates by the German Bundesbank, and the low 
inflation rate. He said that the major challenge is 
unemployment. To preserve Germany as an investment location, 
high-performance elites will have to be called for and accepted 
again.

<F P=106> [`mes' report: "SPD: Expansion of Arms Exports"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Government resolutions that could lead to a 
relaxation of the rules governing arms exports will have a 
bearing on parliament. On Thursday [2 June], the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] spoke of a "major departure" from 
current practice concerning the granting of export permits, and 
demanded that the relevant Bundestag committees be informed. 
The reason is a decision by the Federal Security Council 
reached some time ago, whereby individual permission will no 
longer be required for deliveries of weapons parts to the 25 
countries of the OECD. 
  The Economics Ministry confirmed this resolution last week, 
and said that the Association of German Industry [BDI] would now 
be informed about it. BDI spokesman Volker Franzen welcomed the 
decision, saying that German enterprises would no longer be at a 
disadvantage vis-a-vis other European firms. On the other hand, 
Hermann Bachmaier, the SPD Bundestag faction's expert on arms 
exports controls, criticized the whole procedure, saying that 
the government's principles governing arms exports, laid down in 
1982 and never officially abolished, would thus be circumvented 
to a major extent. 
  According to the government's resolution, supplies of 
weapons 
parts to partner enterprises in the OECD will be permissible 
provided that the German share in the final product does not 
exceed 20 percent. This relaxation does not apply to nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons, nor to carrier systems. In 
addition, the partner firms are to reach agreement with each 
other on "which countries can and cannot receive supplies." The 
current practice of individual permits will continue to apply to 
exports of weapons to Third World countries. 
  The Economics Ministry claimed that the new rules lie 
"within 
the framework of the export-political principles" of 1982, 
adopted by the government of Helmut Schmidt. Without 
specifically mentioning the OECD, the Ministry said that the 
exports of armaments outside NATO remains restricted and, in 
particular, "may not lead to the expansion of export-capable 
armaments production capacity." Employment considerations should 
also play no special significance in exports of war weapons, it 
was said. 
  According to SPD deputy Buchmaier, the new resolutions will 
lead to a "massive expansion" of arms exports by German firms to 
areas beyond NATO. That would also make German weapons firms 
"indirectly" involved in weapons deliveries to the world's 
crisis spots. Buchmaier also referred to the Defense Ministry's 
"planning games" on the subject of establishing a European 
"Agency for Arms Exports." Plans like this would cause a further 
departure from the relatively strong German control criteria 
governing arms exports. 
  Apparently, German industry has been eagerly expecting the 
new regulations. In a statement replying to the government 
resolution, German Aerospace said that European defense 
industries, beset by falling personnel levels, shrinking 
markets, and exploding costs, will be forced to adopt new forms 
of cooperation. "What is needed now is real Eurofirms that are 
capable of transcending all levels of depreciation and political 
borders, and can operate on the basis of their own 
entrepreneurial responsibility," said German Aerospace.

<F P=106> [Interview with designated German Trade Union Federation </F>
chairman Dieter Schulte by I. Zaunitzer-Haase; place and date 
not given: "Not Easier With the SPD"] 
  [Text] [Zaunitzer-Haase] You have chosen an extremely 
dramatic time to take over your new office.... 
  [Schulte] I did not choose anything. However, I did think 
long and hard about whether and under what conditions I will 
take over this task -- if I am elected. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] The trade unions are in a profound crisis. 
Are you taking over a heap of shards? 
  [Schulte] An extremely complicated structure is in a very 
difficult situation. Apart from the decline in the number of 
members, one main reason for the financial difficulties is the 
fact that the individual trade unions -- and also the DGB 
[German Trade Union Federation] -- invested a great deal of 
money in the new laender after unification to build trade union 
structures there in the first place. Now it turns out that the 
high expenditure is not paying off. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What is the reason for that? 
  [Schulte] Disappointment and frustration! At the beginning 
there was enormous optimism in the new laender. They hoped for 
miracles from the economic power of the old FRG. Then when a 
completely wrong policy destroyed the dreams in a rather brutal 
way, hopes were directed at the trade unions. Then came the 
sobering insight that the trade unions alone are not able, 
either, to correct the failed economic policy. Anger was the 
result. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] In only two years the number of members 
went down by 1.4 million! Members are running away, revenues 
are dwindling. 
  [Schulte] The trade unions must analyze their situation 
quite soberly. Their financial potency is a decisive factor. 
One must be quite clear about that. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What can be done? 
  [Schulte] In the individual trade unions many things are 
confusing and are running on parallel tracks. Cooperation 
agreements are necessary. Caring for members! Individual 
advice! It must be ensured that the trade unions understand the 
use of their membership. And then recruiting members -- more 
intensively and in a modernized way. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] But what can the DGB alone do? 
  [Schulte] In any case, we do not want to be a paper factory, 
which we are occasionally accused of. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What are the real tasks? 
  [Schulte] The DGB must be the "advocate of employment" -- 
not only the advocate of the employed. The DGB must strongly 
support the social state, fight for achievements the abolition 
of which would be a relapse into the social Middle Ages. The 
DGB must pursue a policy of equal rights: for women and 
discriminated groups. And it must pursue a European policy. In 
any case, however, a concentration of tasks is now necessary. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Should the trade unions not get rid of 
their own companies -- such as the BfG [Bank fuer 
Gemeinwirtschaft] bank -- because of their financial crisis? 
  [Schulte] No, we should not sell off our silver! I would 
not like to see the trade union houses sold, either. The 
financial crisis must not reach that far. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What is to be done in the DGB itself? 
  [Schulte] The DGB must slim down. This is unavoidable. 
Personnel adjustments will also be necessary. Claims must be 
reduced. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Are you also thinking of reducing 
salaries? 
  [Schulte] One can think of anything. However, one should do 
only something sensible. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] There is fear and displeasure in the DGB. 
Many fear for their job. 
  [Schulte] I have not heard any demands. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Will you yourself still earn more than in 
the past despite the thrift measures? 
  [Schulte] No. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What would you say if you now had to make 
a passionate speech to trade union functionaries? 
  [Schulte] That the DGB is there for everyone, be they big or 
small. And I would point to the reputation of the German trade 
unions abroad. We must soon achieve this in the FRG again, too. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] And what would the passionate speech to 
your fellow-workers in the DGB be like? 
  [Schulte] I would say that everything is open, that 
everyone, really everyone, must be willing to think about his 
own situation. It is incredibly important that there does not 
develop a vacuum or a lack of orientation. We all must pull in 
the same direction. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Do you expect support from the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]? 
  [Schulte] Hardly. I do not even think that for us 
everything would become easier if the SPD were to lead the next 
government. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] Why not? 
  [Schulte] Trade unions and DGB will struggle for the 
preservation and the further expansion of the social state. 
Even with an SPD government this will probably not be easy in 
the course of the general deregulation. 
  [Zaunitzer-Haase] What will you personally do in order not 
to be worn down? 
  [Schulte] I will keep my eyes open in order not to fall into 
traps. I will keep private refuges and play a bit of soccer.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Bofinger, professor of economics at the </F>
University of Wuerzburg: "The Bundesbank Is Chasing an Illusion; 
Its Money Supply Policy Concept Is Not Convincing; M3 Is of 
Unreliable Quality as an Indicator"] 
  [Text] German monetary policy has rarely been as 
contradictory as in these months. The M3 money supply is 
expanding at a double-digit annual rate, and during the rest of 
the year will hardly achieve the target of 4 to 6 percent which 
is to make possible an inflation-free economic growth. In spite 
of that, key interest rates have been further lowered to this 
day, while the Bundesbank announces at every turn that, in 
principle, it will hold onto its money supply concept. 
  One can find an attempt to resolve this contradiction in the 
bank's latest business report. Although it admits "inconstancies 
in the shorter-term money supply development," it stresses at 
the same time that the longer-term links between the growth of 
the money supply and price development have "not been decisively 
touched" by it. The M3 money supply remains "a suitable nominal 
anchor for a stability-oriented monetary policy." 
  But probably it is not quite that simple. First, the 
question 
arises how the Bundesbank actually knows that the money demand 
function, which statistically depicts the dependency 
relationship between money supply and price level, has remained 
stable since the German currency union. With the data for the 
expanded currency area of the German mark, available only since 
1990/91, it is very difficult to estimate precisely these 
longer-term links. If the Bundesbank, however, is in possession 
of such computations, it should not withhold them from the 
public. 
  Furthermore, one must take into consideration that the 
monetary development of recent years was not only characterized 
by "inconstancies" due to temporary shocks, but above all by an 
unusually high growth trend: The M3 money supply from January 
1992 to today shows an annual growth trend of 8.2 percent; the 
"expanded M3 money supply" even grew at a rate of about 10 
percent per year. If one prefers this latter figure, since it 
also takes into account the shifts to the Euromarket due to 
minimum reserves, one must note that the monetary expansion for 
over three years has been almost twice as high as the 
Bundesbank's target figure. If one were to trust in the 
stability of the medium-term connection between money supply and 
inflation--as the Bundesbank does--one would have to arrive at 
the conclusion that German monetary policy is clearly on an 
inflationary course. But since there are no signs whatsoever of 
this, one cannot avoid putting into question, in principle, the 
quality of the M3 money supply as an indicator. That may seem 
more radical than it is. After all, even the Central Bank 
Council--despite all official declarations--has never held to 
this self-chosen compass in the 11 rounds of interest rate 
lowerings it initiated since the fall of 1992. 
  Hence it would be time for the Bundesbank to also officially 
part from its illusion of a money supply policy. The central 
banks of other large countries, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve 
and the Bank of England, took this step years ago. The 
Bundesbank is probably shying away from this, above all, because 
it fears negative effects on its credibility. That can hardly be 
expected, however, since the money supply targets were handled 
rather liberally in the past also. Of the 20 target settings 
announced since 1975, only 10 were actually achieved. With such 
a "hit score," it can hardly be because of the money supply 
concept that the Bundesbank managed to achieve such a high 
degree of reputation. One cannot convince markets with mere 
declarations of intent. Rather, the decisive fact was that the 
Bundesbank, when in doubt, has always used its maneuvering room 
in decisionmaking in favor of the goal of price stability. In 
this light, German monetary policy has succeeded not because of, 
but despite, the money supply concept to preserve its 
credibility. Yet one should not overtax the patience of the 
markets. A renunciation of the money supply concept is probably 
difficult for the Bundesbank because thereby it would have to 
express within the Central Bank Council, and also in public, 
that the current monetary policy can no longer be oriented along 
a--practically objective--medium-term target line. Thus it would 
become clear how complex the business of monetary policy has 
become: The interest rate level on the money market must 
continually be controlled so that a stable price level can be 
achieved, even in the medium term. Since monetary impulses 
affect the value of money only in a delayed fashion, the 
Bundesbank cannot be guided solely by the present inflation 
rate, but must also take into account and cope with a great 
number of indicators. This decisionmaking process would have to 
become more transparent by breaking with the money supply 
concept, and also imbue public discussion with a new quality. 
Instead of a futile debate on ever new interference factors in 
M3, there could be a comprehensive discussion of how one can 
conduct a stability-oriented monetary policy even without a 
money supply target. Not least of all, such a conceptual 
clarification would be fitting in order to provide clear 
leadership on the part of Germany in the upcoming debate on the 
monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank. The 
European partners can hardly be won over to a money supply 
concept to which the Bundesbank itself does not adhere. 
  So there are good reasons for the Bundesbank to separate 
myth 
from reality better than in the past. If it wants to stick to 
the money supply concept at any price, it must prove 
convincingly that a stable link between money supply and 
inflation is still valid, and must also express this in its 
policy. If it wants to continue proceeding "pragmatically," it 
should refrain from constantly reiterating its money supply 
strategy, and rather should clarify on the basis of which 
criteria it actually makes its decisions. Anything else is not 
very compatible with the claim to credibility.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Helga Einecke: "The Fear of the Interest Rate </F>
Pause"] 
  [Text] The financial markets show themselves fearful and 
uncertain in these weeks shortened by holidays. They have been 
deprived of the phantasy by which they live. Lately, market 
participants speculated from week to week on falling interest 
rates, and with this hope the prices rose. But this tooth of 
constantly slightly dropping interest rates was surprisingly 
pulled by the Bundesbank two weeks ago. This not only concerns 
the lowering of key interest rates by half a percent, described 
in exaggeration as significant. In addition, there were 
statements by the Bundesbank president about the cleared-up 
horizon, which were taken as an interest-rate pause until summer 
or fall, or even as the lowest interest rate benchmark. So even 
the minimal lowering of the third key rate this week is of no 
help. Sales of fixed-interest securities predominate, prices are 
tumbling, and long-term interest rates are rising. 
  Thus the calculation of the Bundesbank might work out. The 
declared goal of its signal two weeks ago was favoring long-term 
investments through lower interest rates for short-term 
investments. This is backed by the hope of the guardians of the 
currency that those active in finances, by switching from the 
money market to the capital market, could break down the dam of 
the accumulated money supply. For since the end of last year, 
tax and interest rate uncertainties have produced a decided 
inclination in investors toward short-term disposable money. 
Nurtured by relatively high interest rates, billions are parked 
in accounts and time deposits instead of flowing into long-term 
securities. 
  The excessive money supply is not the only headache for the 
Bundesbank, which can still proudly point to its strong German 
mark. So far, no one has been able to refute the thesis that the 
liquidity glut may harbor the germ of future inflation. At the 
same time, the interest level in this country must remain 
attractive for quite some time to finance unification. It is not 
own capital which dominates the bond market. In 1993, there was 
an influx of 226 billion German marks from abroad, which was 
highly welcome in view of the necessary transfers to east 
Germany. 
  Since February, the tide has turned, and foreigners are 
again 
withdrawing their deposits. The savings rate of Germans also is 
no longer what it was, because the savings rate of 11 percent 
has reached its lowest point in seven years. It is fortunate 
that the dollar also plays in the trans-Pacific field of tension 
and does not outstrip the strong German mark. What was it the 
BHF bank said? The Bundesbank needs a thick skin, also because 
the new slick financial maneuvers can turn any monetary gnat 
into a financial elephant.

<F P=106> [Article by "beu": "Short-Term Interest Rates Still Too High </F>
for the HWWA; Special Factors Responsible for Strong Money 
Supply Growth"] 
  [Text] In the opinion of the HWWA [Hamburg Institute for 
Economic Research], money market interest rates can be lowered 
further in coming months. 
  The HWWA justified its assessment by pointing out that the 
expansion of the money supply, quite strong in the first months 
of the year, will slow down in coming months, since the special 
factors determining growth of the money supply will lose 
importance. A number of reasons indicate that the growth rates 
of the money supply are statistically overstated, and that the 
[present] volume of the money supply will not have an 
inflationary impact. 
  However, it seems hardly possible that the Bundesbank will 
achieve its "very ambitious money supply goal, an expansion of 
M3 by a maximum of 6 percent in 1994," especially since 
liquidity effects from the lowering of the minimum reserve rates 
at the beginning of March and the transfer of Bundesbank gains 
to the Federal Government, a total of 35 billion German marks 
[DM], still have to be absorbed. In the opinion of the HWWA, 
exceeding the goal of 7 percent growth, recommended in the 
spring report of the research institutes, would be "acceptable 
for a certain period, if a perceptible tendency toward lower 
rates of the money supply expansion were to develop. This is 
because the concept of money supply control is geared to the 
medium term." 
  The HWWA counts among the special factors temporarily 
inflating the money supply, among others, that longer-term time 
deposits were converted into shorter-term deposits and that 
short-term funds were shifted from abroad into the country. The 
"window dressing" operations, typical at year's end and 
affecting the balance sheet, evidently were larger than usual. 
Meanwhile, however, they have perceptibly diminished. Special 
tax factors also had an impact, such as the inclusion of 
accumulating investment funds in the interest discount tax as of 
1 January, 1994, which caused extensive selling within the 
country. 
  The HWWA draws attention to the fact that, because of these 
special influences, the effective monetary development is 
difficult to assess. But the interest rate development indicates 
that monetary policy does not have an overly expansive effect. 
Although short-term interest rates have been lowered since 
September 1992, the present level is still relatively high 
compared to earlier, similar economic phases (3-percent money 
market interest rate). Also, the interest structure does not yet 
correspond to the picture usual for this economic phase. 
Short-term interest rates are not yet noticeably enough below 
the long-term rates to offer an adequate incentive for 
investments in fixed assets.

<F P=106> [Article by Prof. Ulrich van Suntum, director of the </F>
Institute for Economic Policy and Business Research at the 
University of Witten/Herdecke, and research associate Stefan 
Huckemann: "High Growth Hardly Counts"] 
  [Text] Persistent unemployment in the Western industrial 
countries has raised doubts as to whether the free market 
economic system is at all capable of providing permanent full 
employment. With the winding down of the postwar boom period in 
the late 1960's, the old fear that sooner or later society would 
run out of work after the most pressing demands of consumers 
were satisfied appeared to be confirmed. Even in subsequent 
recovery periods unemployment rates did come down on a sustained 
basis. According to OECD estimates, nearly 35 million 
people--that is, 8.5 percent of the entire labor force--are 
without work in the Western industrial countries; in the 12 EC 
countries, this rate will even climb to a record 12 percent. 
  Has the Western economic system therefore failed? Has full 
employment become a chimera from an economic wonderland that at 
best can still be achieved with the aid of massive state 
employment programs or by way of a redistribution of scarce work 
through reduced working hours? This question is by no means 
being posed any longer only by those who have always had little 
faith in the self-healing powers of the market. Resignation is 
increasingly taking hold of the traditionally free-market 
oriented economists of the leading international organizations 
such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund. Yet it is 
surprising how little attention is being paid in all this to two 
circumstances that are of paramount importance to a careful 
analysis of the problem: 
  For one thing, it is not true at all, for example, that jobs 
have been lost in the last two decades. On the contrary, the 
number of people gainfully employed has increased by more than 
25 percent in the OECD area with the result that 76.5 million 
more positions were filled in 1991 than in 1970. In Europe alone 
a good 19 million new jobs were created, which, after all, 
amounts to an increase of just under 3 percent. To be sure, this 
increase did not keep pace with the simultaneous growth in the 
numbers of persons seeking employment and consequently the 
problem must obviously be formulated entirely differently than 
it is in the simplistic and empirically false notion of a 
permanent process of labor cutbacks. The question must be raised 
as to the economic mechanisms that can actually satisfy the 
demands for jobs by additional numbers of persons of employable 
age who are coming onto the labor market and the question must 
be asked as to why these mechanisms have functioned in a 
progressively less satisfactory manner in the last 20 years. 
  The second and perhaps more important aspect concerns the 
extremely varied successes of the individual industrial 
countries in overcoming their employment problems. It is by no 
means the case that all countries reacted to the challenge to 
their employment policies in the same way; moreover they were, 
as a result of their basic economic policy orientation, prepared 
for it in different ways. The national rates of unemployment 
also differ radically: Hidden by the average 7.3-percent 
unemployment rate for the OECD countries in the 1980's are rates 
ranging from 2.5 percent and less for Japan, Sweden, and 
Switzerland, to that of a good 10 percent for Italy or even 18 
percent for Spain. Development during the decade was also very 
nonuniform: While Japan, for example, was able to essentially 
maintain its low unemployment figures and even lower them at the 
end of the decade, Italy, by way of example, with its 
unemployment rate of 12 percent, was worse off in the last year 
of the 1980's than in any previous year. 
  There must be reasons for such differences. In less 
successful countries, special influences are quickly cited as an 
explanation for the better performance of other countries. In 
the case of Switzerland, for example, its role as a center of 
and magnet for large capital flows is cited, as is its high 
percentage of foreign workers that serves as a convenient 
employment buffer. For Japan, the principle of lifelong company 
employment--hardly reproducible in other countries--as well as 
its large export surpluses are cited as special factors--often 
in connection with explicit or implied recriminations of 
protectionism. 
  A closer examination reveals the superficiality of such 
explanations, however. In comparison with earlier times, 
Switzerland has by no means "exported" more unemployed persons 
in the past 20 years; the number of foreigners as a percentage 
of the overall labor force during the recession of the early 
1980's remained unchanged for all practical purposes. The 
oft-cited Japanese system of lifelong employment exists there 
only in the large corporations and thus affects only about a 
quarter of the labor force. And, in the final analysis, it is 
not only Japan that can show large export surpluses but, for 
example, the Federal Republic as well, and yet nevertheless it, 
in contrast to Japan, has not been able to maintain full 
employment. Thus, to find the causes of such differences, one 
has to dig deeper. 
  In so doing, it is reasonable to take the basic tenants of 
current economic explanations for the origins of unemployment as 
a point of departure. There is, to be sure, a considerable 
number of relevant hypotheses and some of them are totally 
contradictory. It is, for example, a highly controversial issue 
as to whether technological progress is a jobkiller or a 
jobfiller: On the one hand, it is almost always associated at 
first with the elimination of jobs through rationalization, yet 
on the other hand it reduces costs and creates margins for new 
demand. Even the role of economic growth is evaluated in 
completely different ways: To be sure, new demand is created, 
yet it appears to have a progressively less beneficial impact on 
the employment situation and thereby creates even more 
ecological problems than it solves economic ones. There is also 
controversy among the specialists over the efficacy of state 
labor market policy--such as wage subsidies or job-creation 
programs, for example. Is it necessary compensation for the 
insufficient vitality of competition or does it, in the final 
analysis, hinder the creation of private-sector jobs? 
  Such a plethora of opinions on the part of economists 
literally cries out for empirical examination and there is 
indeed no dearth of relevant research--for the most part 
restricted to only a few countries or to individual hypotheses, 
to be sure. To date, however, there has not been a study that 
for once compared the most important fundamentals of the 
theories and tested their validity in regard to the respective 
employment trends on a cross-section of all the large industrial 
countries. Our study, commissioned by the Berthelsmann 
Foundation, makes that attempt. The questions were: What are the 
causes for the differences in the employment trends of the 17 
most important industrial countries since the early 1980's and 
what lessons regarding economic policy can be learned from them? 
  The difficulties involved in such a comprehensive research 
project are considerable. They begin with the issue of what 
criterion should be used to measure the success of a country's 
employment policy in the first place. Of course, a possibility 
immediately presents itself in the form of unemployment rates 
that are available for most countries based on a standardized 
calculation. Yet the annual increase in employment should also 
play a role: After all, higher growth in the number of jobs is 
also to be considered a success even if it does not result in an 
immediate lowering of the unemployment rate--for example, in the 
case of a sharp increase in the size of the labor force. For a 
specific case, a target figure--a combination of the 
unemployment rate and the increase in the gainfully employed 
population--was chosen as the measure of success. Of course, job 
growth was given progressively less weight as the level of full 
employment achieved by a country rose. In the final analysis, it 
makes little sense to downgrade a country on the basis of 
insufficient new job creation when the full employment target 
there has been largely achieved. 
  It is, of course, far more difficult to identify the 
operative factors that are critical to the success of employment 
policy. Relevant hypotheses, if they are to be scientifically 
validated, must fulfill at least three requirements: They must 
be theoretically plausible, they must be quantifiable in a 
comparative manner applicable to all countries, and they must be 
statistically significant--that is, they must contribute in a 
demonstrable way to explaining the success of the employment 
policy. Out of the multitude of possible hypotheses, 10 
operative factors ultimately emerge that satisfy all these 
requirements. For purposes of better comparison, they were rated 
on a point scale in which the country with the best individual 
score (the highest rate of growth, for example), was given 10 
points and the remaining countries were given correspondingly 
fewer in accordance with their ranking. 
  Applied to the period under investigation--1980 to 1993--the 
differences in the employment policy successes of the 17 
industrial countries studied can be 80 percent explained by 
these 10 performance figures, although, to be sure, the relative 
importance of the individual factors are quite different. They 
were grouped into four categories ("Unions/Labor and 
Management," "Labor Market Policy," "Growth," and "Fiscal 
Policy"). 
  The greatest influence can be attributed to the behavior of 
unions/labor and management. Viewed purely statistically, the 
differences can be 40 percent explained on the basis of this 
factor alone. To wit, it is of critical importance for the 
situation on the labor markets whether unions/labor and 
management respect the distributive margins created by growth in 
productivity and utilize them in a cooperative manner or whether 
they attempt--in the form of unproductive distribution 
conflicts--to distribute more than growth provides--an attempt 
that, after all, is ultimately doomed to failure. Nonetheless, 
this is attempted repeatedly in Spain and Italy and in Canada 
and Australia as well--all countries in which there is an 
extraordinarily great willingness to strike as well as an 
alarming growth in unit labor costs. Indeed, during the period 
studied, an average of 667 working days per 1000 workers were 
lost due to strikes in Spain compared to only 30 days in 
Germany, all of four days in Austria, and less than one day in 
Switzerland. At the same time, unit labor costs--calculated in 
the national currency--rose in Spain by an average of 8.3 
percent--far more than twice as much as in Germany (3 percent), 
for example, or in Austria (3.9 percent) or Japan (2.3 percent). 
Even though these differences were partially compensated for in 
international competition by corresponding exchange rate 
fluctuations, they demonstrate that the domestic distributive 
margins in the countries in question were constantly 
overstrained. The labor markets degenerated into closed 
shop establishments for those who (still) had a job. As a 
result, incentives and latitude for the creation of new jobs 
could hardly be created. 
  Of course, the issue is not solely the average growth in 
wages. The extent to which attention is paid to the differing 
degrees of factory and sector productivity is just as 
important--as is how flexible, for example, working hours are 
arranged and terms of termination are formulated. All of this, 
of course, can only be measured with difficulty. Nonetheless, if 
the percentage of part-time jobs in the overall employment 
picture is taken as the most important indicator of flexibility 
of working conditions, then in this case too it is evident that 
Spain and Italy--with rates of only a good 5 percent--rank at 
the very bottom of the scale. In Sweden and Norway, on the other 
hand, every forth job on average was a part-time job during the 
1980's, and Germany too--with, after all, a good 13 
percent--showed a rising trend. 
  As far as the two Nordic countries are concerned, they, to 
be 
sure, owe their comparatively good employment growth to another 
circumstance--to wit, to an active and innovative state labor 
market policy. In all the countries under comparison it has 
obviously been beneficial when unemployment--once it had come 
about--was not merely compensated for with commensurate subsidy 
payments, but when active measures such as job-creation programs 
are given emphasis. The latter in particular are highly 
important because in this case the causes of difficulty in 
placing somewhat older or very young unemployed persons are 
directly attacked. On a purely statistical basis, about 30 
percent of the international differences caused by labor market 
policy can be explained. Here, of course, it must be borne in 
mind that the employment relationships created in this manner 
have a predominantly different quality than do jobs that are 
created and can be sustained in the private competitive sector. 
The example of Sweden in particular creates doubts as to whether 
this course can be successfully pursued in the long term because 
its negative consequences--in the form of excessive demands on 
public finances, permanent jeopardizing of currency stability, 
and lack of efficiency--have meanwhile become readily apparent 
there. The Swedish unemployment rate has skyrocketed in the past 
four years from 1.5 percent to 7.4 percent. The attempt to 
change to a more free-market and stability-oriented course has 
suddenly revealed the failures of past decades. 
  As far as growth is concerned, it is time to take leave of 
the widespread notion that the employment problem can be solved 
solely by high growth. Countries such as Australia, Italy, and 
Canada that, to be sure, have all grown at faster-than-average 
rates over the past 15 years yet at the same time are suffering 
much greater unemployment problems than countries with weaker 
growth, are examples that contradict this notion. Indeed 
Switzerland, for example, had the lowest average growth rate of 
all the countries but at the same time had the lowest rates of 
unemployment. Growth is, of course, essential for countries such 
as the Federal Republic that find themselves confronted with a 
sharp increase in the size of the labor force. If the number of 
persons seeking jobs grows, full employment without cuts in real 
wages can only be maintained with the aid of investments and 
high growth. This, of course, applies especially when income 
expectations include additional increases. This explains why 
economic growth--calculated across the board for all 
countries--nonetheless proves to be responsible for 20 percent 
of employment policy success. 
  But what is really important, after all, is not the absolute 
level of economic growth but much rather the degree to which the 
distributive margins that make it possible are respected. Not 
only unproductive distribution conflicts between unions/labor 
and management are at issue here, but also the demands that the 
state places on the distributable national product. Since the 
early 1970's, these demands have been progressively ratcheted 
upwards in virtually all countries and, in the Scandinavian 
countries in particular, they amounted on average over the 
period studied to well over 50 percent--and in Sweden to even 
more than 60 percent--of the national product. Along with this 
came a progressively increasing burden on the citizenry in the 
form of taxes and social security contributions that drove an 
ever-greater wedge between what had to be earned on the job and 
what in the final analysis remained leftover from real income. 
To be sure, the importance of these burdens for explaining the 
international differences in employment growth is, at about 10 
percent, not apparently very high, yet that is probably due to 
the fact that essentially all countries have embarked upon this 
fateful course equally, and partially due to proliferating 
national deficits. There are, certainly, two notable exceptions: 
To wit, Switzerland and Japan, countries that with government 
expenditure rates averaging only 24 percent and 32 percent 
respectively for the years 1980-1993 rank at the very bottom end 
of the scale. Is it a coincidence that these two countries have 
by far the best employment situation? 
  All too facile monocausal explanations of the situation on 
the labor markets should, of course, be avoided. None of the 
cited factors can adequately explain the varying employment 
policy successes in the industrial countries by itself and 
examples can be easily found contradicting any such attempt. 
Only when all performance figures can be viewed in context does 
the picture become clearer. The 17 industrial countries studied 
can then grouped into four fundamentally different categories 
that in each case have adopted very different strategies. 
Analysis shows that a direct correlation exists between these 
strategies and the respective success of employment policy. 
  Japan and Switzerland, for example, are thus in both 
respects--in regard to performance figures well as employment 
policy success--ahead of all the countries, while conversely 
Italy, Denmark, and Spain, for example, rank at the very end of 
the scale in regard to both point scores for performance and 
target figures. For the countries ranked in the middle, the 
proportionate correlation is, with a few exceptions, striking. 
If a mean value is derived from the point scores for target and 
performance figures, a graphic ranking of the 17 industrial 
countries results that illustrates both employment policy 
success and the performance figures critical to it (see table). 
Since it is, after all, based on mean values of a time period 
spanning 14 years, it is to a great extent independent of 
incidental--for instance cyclical--influences. The point scores 
of the individual countries are derived from their performance 
as it relates to the factors of growth, fiscal policy, labor 
market policy, unions/labor and management, as well as the 
increase in the gainfully employed population and the rate of 
unemployment. The highest theoretical score is 10.0 points.

  One thus has a basis for more precisely analyzing which 
strategies countries have pursued in individual cases and how 
successful they have been with them. Among the most successful 
countries, one group can be initially identified which 
includes--in addition to Japan, Switzerland, and 
Austria--Germany and, with some qualifications, the United 
States. They can best be characterized as stability-oriented 
free-market economies because they have a high degree of social 
and monetary stability and their employment policies rely 
primarily on free-market economy instruments. The salient 
characteristics of these countries are few strikes and a 
relatively small increase in unit labor costs in association 
with low inflation and comparatively modest overall tax and 
revenue burdens. All this, of course, is interdependent. If 
wage-price spirals could be avoided to a great extent in these 
countries, then this has been due to the soundness of their 
monetary and fiscal policies as well as to a sense of 
responsibility on the part of unions/labor and management. Thus, 
the vitality of their markets was sufficiently strong to create 
competitive jobs that are not critically dependent upon labor 
cost subsidies and government aid. 
  From the German perspective it may appear surprising that 
West Germany (the new federal laender could not be taken into 
account) is represented in this top group. In fact, the 
situation on the western German labor market can hardly be 
satisfactory, yet here we are dealing with a relative comparison 
to other industrial countries--and as is well-known, among the 
blind the one-eyed man is king. It should also not be overlooked 
that the gap between Germany and the model countries Switzerland 
and Japan is considerable and that particularly in recent years 
Germany has diverged in many respects from the model of a 
stability-oriented free-market economy--and not solely due to 
the special burdens of German unification. Thus, unit labor 
costs have risen alarmingly, and the burdens upon the economy 
caused by social and fiscal policies have reached record 
levels--even without nursing care insurance. 
  Germany, especially in respect to fiscal policy, has moved 
in 
the direction of a second group of countries that can most 
appropriately be characterized as active employment policy 
welfare states. This group, in which, in addition to Sweden and 
Norway, Portugal can also be placed--at least for the first half 
of the 1980's--also has, to be sure, comparatively good 
employment policy results to show. It has achieved them in an 
entirely different manner, however--namely, with the aid of wage 
subsidies and job-creation and training programs as well as--and 
not least of all--the expansion of employment in the public 
sector. Whoever advocates imitating this course of a second or 
third labor market should certainly pay attention to its 
niceties as well: In both Sweden and Norway great emphasis is 
placed upon ensuring that when a job or opportunity for advanced 
training is offered at the employment office, it is accepted as 
well--slackers are eliminated in this way. Above all, however, 
this manner of providing employment as a function of government 
is associated with extremely high costs and losses in 
efficiency. The Swedish example makes the viability of it in the 
long term appear doubtful. 
  Countries that have neither sufficient free-market economic 
vitality nor an active labor market policy but simply attempt to 
ameliorate the evil of unemployment through comparatively 
generous social safety net systems are, of course, even worse 
off. These welfare states that have passive employment 
policies--which include Denmark, France, Belgium, and the 
Netherlands--are caught in a true welfare trap: The creation of 
new jobs is impeded by high taxes and social security 
contributions while, on the other hand, the taxes cannot be 
reduced because unemployment is high and because individual 
incentives for reentering the labor market are often lacking. 
The fact that the Netherlands, for example, with a million 
work-disabled persons and an astonishingly large number of young 
people among them, has the highest rate of work-disabled people 
of all industrialized countries, has certainly less to do with 
any particular health hazard in that country than it has to do 
to a far greater extent with tangible negative economic 
incentives. Once a country is deep enough in the quicksand of 
the welfare state, however, the employment policy consequences 
are not long in making themselves felt, as the poor showing of 
the countries in question in the ranking list shows. 
  The employment situation is similarly miserable in a final 
group of industrial countries which includes Australia, Canada, 
Italy, Spain, and (at least until the mid-1980's) Great Britain. 
Individually, these countries have admittedly very divergent 
problems but their common characteristics are serious 
distribution conflicts among the socially relevant groups and in 
particular between unions/labor and management as well. They are 
thus the exact opposites of stability-oriented free-market 
economies: many strikes and permanent wage-price spirals usually 
associated with a grim fiscal situation and little 
imaginativeness in government labor market policy. That is the 
scenario that gives rise to the highest rates of unemployment 
and the lowest growth in jobs of all industrialized countries. 
The poor ranking of the countries in question are thus not 
surprising. 
  The upshot of all the research can be stated in summarized 
form in one sentence: Social and monetary stability in 
association with a government economic policy that is able to 
unite social security with the preservation of adequate 
performance incentives is the best guarantor for full 
employment. This conclusion may not be very surprising to 
economists, but the unambiguous manner in which it can be 
extrapolated from international experience over the past 15 
years probably will be. It seems that not only has full 
employment been lost in the industrialized countries, but the 
knowledge of relatively simple economic relationships that 
should have been observed for the maintenance of a high level of 
employment has been as well.

<F P=106> ["J.B." commentary: "Ambiguous Impression"] </F>
  [Text] Well, what is one supposed to say? Bill Clinton 
sits down at one table with Italian fascists. The U.S. 
President talks with Rome government members who would like to 
be grandsons of Mussolini. Perhaps one should also call them 
the Berchtesgaden group of Berlusconi's cabinet. These people 
can be partners in a talk for the Democrat from Washington? 
  In Germany we have ambiguous experiences with such and 
similar situations. They are bad experiences, as far as the 
attempt to punish objectionable partners in international 
politics by denying diplomatic or other visits and contacts to 
them is concerned. This did not work, to say the most harmless 
thing about it. However, the experiences with the effect of 
international normality in the dealings between the National 
Socialists and foreign statesmen that Hitler's opponents had to 
make at home were even worse. Many warnings fell flat, resolute 
persons lost courage when they saw how honor was paid to someone 
to whom it was not due. Here logic does not mean anything. The 
same people who would have wildly abused Kohl if Honecker had 
not been suitably received in Bonn are criticizing him today 
because he did so. 
  However, such ambiguousness has to be endured. These are the 
costs of the possession of power. By the way, Clinton also 
visited a U.S. military cemetery and recalled the United States' 
war against the fascists, which gave freedom back to the 
country. That is right.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Uwe Jean Heuser: "Trade Liberates"] </F>
  [Text] All those critics who accuse Bill Clinton of 
pursuing a wishy-washy policy have been set right by the U.S. 
President. He linked the decision to continue to grant China 
most-favored-nation [MFN] status to an unambiguous message: 
Henceforth, the most powerful man in the world will no longer 
make favorable trade conditions dependent on human rights. This 
change of position is based on opportunism to a large degree; 
nevertheless it is reasonable. 
  After all, the President has to put up accusations that he 
has broken his word. The Chinese rulers do not take human 
rights more seriously now than they did a year ago, although 
this is exactly what Clinton had demanded as a condition for 
continued free trade. Now, the White House has clarified the 
issue once and for all. It was the only possibility for Clinton 
to avoid having to deal with the tiresome Chinese problem year 
after year. 
  The decision is the result of practical interests. To gain 
the support of the U.S. public, which is sensitive as far as 
human rights questions are concerned, Clinton was unusually 
explicit about the advantages. U.S. exporters now cannot only 
expand their position at the largest regional future market, but 
even consumers at home will continue to benefit form inexpensive 
Chinese goods. Moreover, the Americans need China to keep North 
Korea in check. 
  After all, from the other industrialized nations no support 
for sanctions was to be expected -- officials in Bonn, Paris, 
and Tokyo would have secretly even been happy about the 
weakening of the U.S. competitors. One example: At the moment, 
Daimler-Benz and Chrysler are vying for a license to construct 
minivans in China; Clinton's tough position would have 
threatened the chances of the car manufacturers from Detroit. 
Uncle Sam is no longer strong enough to be able to simply 
ignore -- as sometimes during the Cold War -- that his partners 
were shamelessly taking advantage of such opportunities instead 
of backing the U.S. course. Finally, Clinton also had to 
consider the suspicion of other Asian countries that have 
accused Washington of cultural imperialism. Recently Britain 
experienced how sensitive dealings with the new economic powers 
in the Far East have meanwhile become: As a result of 
corruption accusations in the English press, Malaysia excluded 
British enterprises from public orders -- a short time ago 
Britain's trade minister left for Kuala Lumpur with an offer for 
reconciliation. 
  So much for plain pragmatism, but Clinton's step was correct 
even under more principled criteria. Trade not only increases 
prosperity, it also exerts a pressure for liberalization -- 
particularly in view of the rising internationalization of the 
economy. Although this thesis is regarded as vague by many, and 
as hope based on an ideology that is geared toward the economy, 
in most cases it is, after all, true: Once the material basic 
needs are fulfilled, and it is possible to achieve modest 
prosperity, the people will press for political freedom. In the 
long run, economic progress will undermine the foundations of 
dictatorial rule. 
  This is why, without being cynical, one can follow the 
motto: 
"If in doubt, opt for free trade." Yet, those who support this 
position must also think of the consequences. Although China is 
not the only country in Asia that infringes systematically on 
human rights, the faults of the regime in Beijing are certainly 
grave; and nothing is likely to change in the short term, 
either. Therefore, it has nothing to do with cultural 
imperialism when the West criticizes oppression in Tibet and the 
arrest of dissidents. Clinton saw himself even forced to admit 
that one could not even prevent the import of goods produced by 
forced labor. 
  Yet, the United States' decision and the attitude of the 
other industrialized nations also illustrate the yardstick for 
future sanctions. In similar cases, moral arguments for trade 
barriers will no longer be acceptable, even if political 
interests and election dates would suggest that it is advisable 
to isolate certain states from trade by pointing to human 
rights. Those who opt for free trade with China can hardly 
maintain sanctions against Cuba. 
  The outrage of Western politicians about working conditions 
in threshold countries that are unworthy of man also become 
implausible. The United States, for example, has strongly 
criticized the lack of social standards in Malaysia and 
Indonesia. To pretend that one is worried about the labor rights 
in such cases, while importing products of forced labor from 
China, is hypocritical. The important point here is 
protectionism -- closing the market for one's own advantage. 
  Of course, there will always be exceptions. When it is 
necessary to stop ethnically motivated crimes as in the former 
Yugoslavia or to isolate the former apartheid regime in South 
Africa, then sanctions will undoubtedly be legitimate. With the 
exception of South Africa, the FRG almost always rejected trade 
sanctions. Although this was done out of German economic 
interests, the position of the government in Bonn has also been 
politically worthwhile, as can be seen by the example of the 
former East Bloc. 
  Therefore, the Germans, in particular, must be careful when 
political opportunism -- different to the case of China -- will 
call for trade sanctions. Bill Clinton's change of policy would 
have a liberating effect if it were to make such double moral 
standards more difficult in the future.

  [Text] In an office at the Innsbruck University Hospital, 
Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock answered questions from 
correspondents on the European Union [EU]. After an 
intervertebral disc operation, Mock is still undergoing hospital 
treatment. 
  The EU referendum in one week will be the decision on a 
historic chance, Mock said. 
  [Begin Mock recording] There are certain windows of 
opportunity in history, and if they are not opened at the right 
time, one misses historic chances for one's country. There was 
such a window in 1955. Everyone knew that after October 1956 -- 
after the Hungarians' crushed struggle for freedom against the 
communist regime -- it would no longer be possible to get the 
Soviet Union to agree [to the State Treaty]. There is such a 
window again today. [end recording] 
  Foreign Minister Alois Mock also made a personal appeal: 
  [Begin Mock recording] I will ask the Austrians to say yes. 
The country is at stake. If the government is to be taught a 
lesson, which is, quote, part of democracy, unquote, there will 
be the elections in October. Everyone will then be able to 
express his opinion on the party that provided a minister with 
whom he is not satisfied. The important point to be stressed is 
that this country and the continuity of its success is now at 
stake. [end recording] 
  All in all, however, Mock concluded that the majority of the 
population will say yes to the European Union.

<F P=106> [Report signed "a.u.": "Fasslabend: Ukraine Important for </F>
Stability"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- "The independence of Ukraine is one of the 
most important factors of stability in Europe." This assessment 
was reached by Defense Minister Fasslabend after a visit to the 
large successor state of the Soviet Union. However, the 
minister came to some conclusions which contradict many other 
critical reports about the country: In his view, the city of 
Kiev or the large Antonov works (aircraft) work better than 
other East European states. [sentence as published] 
  "What does not work is the reorientation of the economy. In 
that regard there are big problems." Fasslabend also noted that 
Ukraine is still defining itself very much in its old context, 
that of the Soviet Union. "The country's identity must be 
strengthened." In the establishment of the new Ukrainian Armed 
Forces, there is great emphasis on external symbols -- new 
uniforms, new defense districts. 
  Bilaterally, the minister wants to cooperate more with Kiev. 
The first step is sending a military attache to Kiev. 
  Particularly important for the new state is the current 
Crimean crisis with Russia. "This is an emotional issue. It is 
so important that Ukraine will do anything to prevent the Crimea 
from seceding."

<F P=106> [Article signed BS: "Government Finances Are Smaller </F>
Handicap Than Before"] 
  [Text] "The situation of public finances in Belgium is less 
of a handicap than before," Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy 
said yesterday at a dinner of institutional investors organized 
by the Petercam stockbrokers. If the forecasts turn out 
correct, then the Belgian Government deficit, this year 
amounting to 5.7 percent of the GDP, will fall slightly below 
the European average. 
  Van Rompuy pointed out that tax levels, despite increases 
since 1991, remained below 1987 levels. "We must watch over 
competitiveness," the minister said. "But the forecast of a 
balance of trade surplus of 400 billion Belgian francs (BFr) 
this year (Bfr350 billion in 1993) still remains remarkable. It 
cannot be put down to weak imports, since growth will be higher 
than 1 percent." 
  Van Rompuy criticized the Leuven-based economists who called 
for a currency devaluation last year to bring down interest 
rates. "Short-term interest rates are just as low as German and 
Netherlands rates and the surplus on the balance of trade is the 
best justification for the strong currency," Van Rompuy said. 
  He said that "it was encouraging that companies' 
investments, 
after a serious downturn, would increase by 3 percent in real 
terms this year and by 6 percent next year." 
  But there are structural weaknesses. The state employs 
637,000 people, and 995,000 people receive unemployment benefit. 
The private sector employs 2.1 million people, and there are 
680,000 independent workers. That group of 2.8 million people 
is too narrow, the minister said. 
  "The vicious circle of unemployment has to be broken 
through," he said. "When we consider reaching the Maastricht 
standard of a 3 percent reduction in charges, then reducing the 
employers' social contribution must be given priority over 
reducing personal income tax," he said. 
  "Social insecurity has a price. Insecurity adds costs to the 
budget. The Justice Ministry budget increased by Bfr4.2 billion 
between 1978 and 1988 and by Bfr9 billion, or three times as 
quickly, between 1988 and 1993. For this reason, care is needed 
with low benefits," Van Rompuy said. "Our problem is that in 
some sectors, the number of people entitled to social benefits 
is too high. More selectivity is necessary," he said. 
  "In my view, the seriousness and the likelihood of the risk 
to income should be taken into consideration," he said. 
"Nothing undermines the legitimacy of the social security 
system more than not tracking down and punishing abuses." 
  The answer lays in delegating responsibility. "People, 
organizations, and institutions must be encouraged to manage 
their affairs economically," he said. "The approach in the 
health care sector is already bearing fruit," he said. "Real 
growth was reduced to 1 percent in 1993. We are expecting a 
growth of 1.25 percent in 1994. In 1991 and 1992, the increase 
was 7 percent," he said. 
  "Making people responsible for themselves goes hand in hand 
with solidarity," Van Rompuy concluded. "If the economy is to 
survive and flourish, then Homo Economicus is in himself not 
enough. We must remain deeply aware of this paradox," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Terrorists Are Planning Revenge"] </F>
  [Text] Combatants of the Islamic resistance movement 
Hezbollah (party of God), in cooperation with top terrorists, 
are preparing attacks against Israeli targets abroad. In this 
context, they are also planning to operate on German soil. 
According to Arab intelligence services, a close collaborator 
of legendary terrorist Carlos has left his hideout in Iran and 
arrived in Beirut to prepare some operations. In the Lebanese 
capital, Carlos' aide discussed with the the Iranian Hezbollah 
chief coordinator for operations abroad establishing terrorist 
cells that will also be active in the Federal Republic. The 
members of such cells will, above all, be recruited from the 
Islamistic movement in Tunisia. The ill-famed terrorist 
organization of Abu Nidal has channeled four combatants with 
forged travel documents from Beirut via Cyprus to Germany. The 
planned terrorist operations are intended as revenge for the 
kidnapping of Islamic activist Mustafa al-Dirani. The chief of 
the "Faithful Resistance" group was kidnapped by Israeli special 
units from Lebanon last month. In this way, the Israelis wanted 
to obtain information on the fate of the Israeli military pilot 
Ron Arad who, according to information obtained by the Israelis, 
had fallen into the hands of al-Dirani combatants. While 
security for Israeli facilities abroad has been stepped up, 
Jerusalem has increased the military fight against Islamic 
extremists. At least 25 people were killed in an air raid on 
Hezbollah positions in Lebanon on 2 Jun. The Hezbollah fighters 
struck back by launching missile attacks against northern Israel.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The Hamburg police have banned 
a demonstration planned for Saturday [4 June] by left-wing 
Turkish groups outside the Turkish Consulate General because 
clashes are feared. Police stated today that several Turkish and 
Kurdish organizations have announced their participation in the 
demonstration against the deportation of Iranian asylum-seekers 
from Turkey to Iran. The ban is extended to substitute 
demonstrations which have not yet been registered. 
  The ban has been imposed against the background of the 
serious clashes between left- and right-wing Turks last weekend 
when four people were injured. Three arson attacks were carried 
out on Turkish establishments on Sunday, which police assume 
were connected to the clashes.

<F P=106> [Inger Blomqvist report: "Lieutenant General Gustav </F>
Hagglund: The Russian Troops Are a Stabilizing Factor"] 
  [Text] Lieutenant General Gustav Hagglund, the defense 
forces' future commander in chief, does not view the transfer of 
troops to areas close to our borders as a threat. He noted that 
they have not been stationed there to attack, but rather to 
defend the St. Petersburg region and because they are dependent 
on the services a garrison can provide. 
  Gustav Hagglund, who yesterday drank morning coffee with 
members of the Association of Women Journalists, said that 
originally the intention had been that around 60 percent of 
Soviet soldiers returning home would be stationed in Ukraine and 
Belarus. Because of the collapse of the Soviet Union these 
plans came to nought and the majority ended up being stationed 
in garrisons near the Finnish border. 
  These garrisons have -- in part through Finnish assistance 
-- 
been extended in order to be able to accept a larger number of 
soldiers. 
  One of the reasons why those returning home are keen to live 
in a garrison is that there they can get free meals every day, 
while the meal allowance paid out to those who do not live in 
garrisons is only enough for food for one to two days a week. 
  Hagglund also pointed out that in numerical terms the troop 
force is hardly increasing at all, since conscripts from the 
garrisons are being transferred elsewhere. 
  On the other hand, the numbers of permanent staff have 
increased and the quality of equipment has improved as a result 
of the transfers. 
  He takes the view that as long as the political situation is 
under control in Russia the troops do not represent any danger 
to Finland, but on the contrary are a stabilizing factor. 
  If, however, something happens and problems with discipline 
arise the troops are of course a danger, Hagglund said. 
  He added, however, that the Russian Army has hitherto been 
surprisingly united and was not even split by the nationalists' 
uprisings. 
  Despite poor wages and wages that at times have completely 
failed to materialize the Army has remained intact. 
  Nor can he recall that the Soviet Army has ever rebelled, so 
on the whole he views the current situation in Russia with calm. 
  The threat could be that the nationalists take over power or 
that a civil war flares up because of further fragmentation. 
  On the subject of Finland's own position he said that future 
defense strategy is entirely dependent on what decision the 
country reaches on the European Union [EU] question. 
  If Finland and Sweden do not join, cooperation will continue 
with the Nordic area -- cooperation that came about in the 
seventies when people came up with the idea of talking about 
Fennoscandia. 
  If Sweden were to join the EU but not Finland, the points of 
reference would be different and attention would then be drawn 
to the Baltic countries that would probably eventually seek 
membership in the EU. 
  According to Hagglund, membership in the EU would give 
Finland political support in a crisis situation and with it a 
certain security guarantee. 
  He takes the view that it is difficult to plan as long as EU 
membership is an open question. The defense forces are 
following the same defensive line as before -- a line that, 
according to Hagglund, could well serve as a model for other 
small countries. 
  On the subject of the purchase of equipment from Russia and 
the former East Germany, Gustav Hagglund said that this 
equipment by no means is scrap, but is equipment that has 
"filled gaps." However, he admitted that quality has not 
increased as a result of the purchases and said that what the 
Army needs now is high-tech equipment to come up to the levels 
of the nineties. With the purchases made the Army is more on 
the level of the seventies. 
  However, today there is no money for high-tech equipment and 
he believes that if the Armed Forces had received 450 million 
markkas in money instead of in materiel as a way of reducing the 
Soviet Union's debt to Finland, it is likely that more equipment 
for the nineties would have been bought. 
  According to the original framework agreement with the 
Soviet 
Union for the years 1991-95, Finland would buy equipment 
totaling 3.7 billion markkas from the Soviet Union. Half of 
this sum has now been deferred, and of the remaining half, 50 
percent has gone to domestic industry. Only one-quarter of the 
original sum remains in trade with our eastern neighbor.

<F P=106> [Article by Lars-Olof Streng: "The Hornet Project Moving </F>
Forward: Valmet Delivers First Panels"] 
  [Text] The offset deal negotiated as part of the Hornet 
sale has begun to move forward. The first pair of side panels 
for the forward portion of the fuselage were shipped last 
Wednesday [4 May] from the Valmet aircraft plant in Halli, 
Kuorevesi, for delivery to McDonnell's assembly plant in St. 
Louis, Missouri. In all, 57 side panels will be manufactured for 
airplanes ordered by Finland, which are to be assembled in 
Halli, and 147 will be manufactured for the United States, 
according to the U.S. Navy. 
  However, according to Pertti Jokinen, former commander of 
Finland's Air Force and now project director for Valmet, the 
number of panels that will be made depends upon how well the 
F-18 Hornet sells in the future. By the time production at 
Valmet is in full swing next year, Valmet will be the only 
producer of this particular part. 
  What are side panels? They are the portion of the fuselage 
that occupies the place between the nose cone and the cockpit 
(Forward Fuselage Side Panel Assembly). Produced from a 
composite of coal, synthetic, and glass fibers or cables, the 
side panels consist of approximately 1,500 parts and require 
just as many hours to be assembled. 
  The assembly work on the first pair began last year in early 
September. Some 32 weeks of personnel training was required to 
produce the first pair. In 1996, when production is in full 
swing, a pair of panels will not take more than 16 weeks to 
finish, Jokinen indicated. 
<H5>  Other Components </H5>
  Side panels are not the only components that Valmet and its 
subsidiary, Valmet Avicomp, is manufacturing for McDonnell 
Douglas. The final assembly of the 57 single-seater F-18 
Hornets, the assembly and installation of 57 complete 
undercarriages, and the final assembly of 121 Hornet motors, 
including inspection and testing, is not all there is to 
Valmet's share of the pie. 
  Valmet is also manufacturing flaps made of composite for the 
fuselage's dorsal cover, 57 of which are destined for the 
Finnish Air Force and 158 for the U.S. Navy. In addition, there 
are the 200 Series flaps for the U.S. Navy, which are Northrop's 
part of the offset deal. 
  Except for the Finnish airplane contract, these figures are 
only estimates. If more planes are ordered, Finland will make 
more components. Should the orders from the U.S. Navy slow down 
for any reason, then Valmet's deliveries would also slow down. 
  There is also a provision in the offset sale for the 
delivery 
of 10 Redigo planes, the final four of which are to be delivered 
this year. According to Jokinen, these are not part of the 
Hornet project. 
  "So far, 18 of the flaps have been delivered to MDA 
(McDonnell Douglas)," he added. "One delivery was a day late, 
the others were on schedule. U.S. quality standards were met 100 
percent." 
  Some 304 units for the 39 Series flaps have been delivered 
so 
far. "Here, also, quality standards were met 100 percent," he 
said. 
<H5>  Reticent </H5>
  When asked what the value of Valmet's parts deliveries meant 
in real money, he was reluctant to answer. It is a business 
secret. But he said that the offset sale corresponded to 2,600 
jobs annually extending to the year 2000. 
  From the experience in parts manufacturing and with final 
assembly, Valmet will hopefully acquire the capability to handle 
servicing and repairs on the Hornet in the future. 
  It has been Valmet's objective to utilize its available 
resources on the project, with minimal new investment. It will 
be necessary to build a new surface finishing plant. The rest of 
the final assembly will be done in the same buildings in which 
the 12 Dragons and 46 Hawks were formerly assembled. 
  "Then the bubble will not be burst when the project is 
finished," said Jokinen. 
  That would be a catastrophe for employment in a little place 
like Halli. 
  To the contrary, the Hornet sale should ensure that 
employment at the aircraft plant, which has been in continuous 
operation since 1921, lasts a good way into the next century. 
<H5>  And Yet, the Offset Sale... </H5>
  None is willing to give a precise answer as to what the 
final 
figures on the Hornet offset sale will ultimately be. In the 
case of the Air Force, the bets are close to 4 billion markkas. 
The Hornet deal is projected today at between 16 and 17 billion 
markkas. Back when the deal was concluded, the Finnish customers 
had anticipated a 100-percent offset sale. 
  So much is still left to do. 
  The face of Glenn Cunningham, director of the McDonnell 
Douglas office in Helsinki, was aglow in Halli's spring sunshine 
as he accepted delivery of the first pair of side panels: 
  ``The side panels are an essential part of the airplane's 
fuselage, both in the number of components and the amount of 
work involved. Everything depends on timely delivery. If the 
parts deliveries are late, the assembly work in St. Louis stops. 
Which is not cheap! 
  ``But the delivery is taking place on the appointed day and 
represents a milestone in the project. And we are pleased with 
the quality of the parts that Valmet has thus far delivered!''

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Valmet Scales Down Its Aircraft </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] Valmet's aircraft industry is making a major 
reduction in personnel, including a layoff of nearly a hundred 
workers at the Kuorevesi site. The reason given for the 
personnel reductions was a downturn in market conditions. The 
downturn is most noticeable in the demand for the Redigo, a 
training aircraft. The announcement of the layoffs came on 
Thursday [5 May]. 
  According to Managing Director Juhani Markula, conditions 
are 
expected to remain difficult for quite some time. As the backlog 
of orders can provide work for only a short time, layoffs in 
parts manufacturing for the Redigo plane will also be necessary 
at Avicomp in August. Those layoffs would affect 100 employees 
at the most. 
  The company began last Thursday to negotiate with personnel 
on the reductions and layoffs. Valmet aviation currently has 
1,000 employees, 800 of whom work in Kuorevesi. Nearly 200 more 
work in the motor service units in Linnavuori in Nokia. 
  According to Markula, the intended measures do not threaten 
the Hornet and Saab 2000 project or the production of air combat 
materiel. However, the measures will affect all types of workers 
in the aircraft industry. 
  Valmet had revenues of 256 million markkas last year in 
comparison with 202 million markkas the year before. In 1992, 
losses amounted to 23 million markkas, last year they dropped to 
1 million markkas. 
  At year's end, it was expected that revenues would grow and 
that profits would increase in the coming year. According to the 
annual report, the number of aircraft in stock increased last 
year as a result of canceled orders. The Saab 2000 project, in 
turn, is behind schedule because of delays in technical approval.

<F P=106> [Staffan Bruun report: "Zhirinovskiy's Lawyer: Demands for </F>
Compensation Are Up to European Levels"] 
  [Text] "If Finland is to join the European Union [EU], we 
will also have to adjust our levels of compensation to those of 
Europe. Our demands for compensation from HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and 
the Swedish Theater are high by Finnish standards, but not 
compared with the practice in Europe. And if damages were to be 
awarded in the United States another zero would be added to the 
figures." 
  So said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's legal representative, 
assistant district judge George Paile. He gave assurances that 
the cases against HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater will 
be pursued as private actions regardless of whether the public 
prosecutor supports the actions or not. 
  This means that Jutta Zilliacus' column of 14 April will be 
the subjected to legal examination. Helsinki District Court 
will have to decide whether or not the word "madcap" 
[galenpanna] damaged Zhirinovskiy's good name. In the same way 
the Swedish Theater's use of Zhirinovskiy's voice in the play 
Mein Kampf will also be examined by the district 
court. 
  Paile is demanding a total of 14 million markkas from 
HUFVUDSTADSBLADET and the Swedish Theater in damages to 
compensate for loss of earnings and mental suffering. 
  Paile confirmed to HUFVUDSTADSBLADET that his boss has 
neither read the column in HUFVUDSTADSBLADET nor seen the play 
at the Swedish Theater. 
  So in what way has he suffered harm? 
  "I have translated the column for Zhirinovskiy so he is well 
aware of what it says. I have also reported how the Swedish 
Theater used his voice and how the theater identified him with a 
notorious war criminal. Zhirinovskiy has been informed that we 
are bringing a case and has approved our action," Paile said. 
  According to Paile, there are also limits to how insulting 
one can be about politicians. 
  "Politicians should accept more criticism and more 
acrimonious criticism than ordinary people, but there are 
limits. Politicians also have a right to defend their 
integrity. People should not be allowed to insult them just 
anyhow. If people do this in a newspaper or in a theater they 
must be prepared to be taken to court and ready to pay damages." 
  George Paile said that he is considering further legal 
actions in Finland. 
  ``There are a few borderline cases that I am still giving 
consideration to. The principle is that I will only bring an 
action if I am sure of winning. That is why it is possible that 
there will not be any more actions, this time. 
  ``On the other hand there will be many similar actions 
brought out in Europe. Some of them I am involved in 
personally, but in countries where I cannot manage the language 
I am hiring lawyers. As Zhirinovskiy's representative in the 
West it is my job to protect his legal and economic interests.'' 
  Is this good business? 
  "Of course it is good business." 
  It is still unclear when the case will come before the 
district court. But what does seem to be clear is that this 
will not be before late August/early September. 
  Legal experts think it extremely unlikely that Zhirinovskiy 
and Paile will win their cases and be awarded damages. 
  Nevertheless Pekka Koskinen, professor of criminal law, is 
critical of Jutta Zilliacus'column. 
  ``I have read through her text very carefully and have to 
admit that the column as a whole can be seen as insulting. The 
word `madcap' is by no means the worst thing, but it would seem 
that this word alone is being used as the argument for damages. 
I think that to an extent Jutta Zilliacus has fallen to the 
same level of linguistic usage that she is criticizing 
Zhirinovskiy for. 
  ``Nevertheless I could never imagine that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET 
would be found guilty. In 1983 a number of Eduskunta deputies 
from the Finnish Rural Party claimed damages from Rundradion 
because a program had made ironic and acrimonious remarks about 
them. The deputies won their case in the city court and the 
Court of Appeal, but lost in the Supreme Court. 
  ``The reason for the acquittal was that politicians and 
public figures must be able to stand criticism and irony. In 
the light of this it is unthinkable that HUFVUDSTADSBLADET would 
be found guilty.'' 
  According to Koskinen, as far as the Swedish Theater is 
concerned it is if possible even clearer that a guilty verdict 
is out of the question. 
  "If the Swedish Theater only used a 10-second sound bite of 
Zhirinovskiy the theater could not possibly be found guilty. It 
is crystal clear that people can make free use of pictures of 
politicians and quotations from them." 
  This has not always been the case in Finland, Koskinen 
recalled. 
  "In the thirties a Finn was found guilty of speaking 
disparagingly about Adolf Hitler." 
  Jutta Zilliacus cannot understand Pekka Koskinen's criticism 
of her column. 
  ``It is shameless of Koskinen to say that my column is 
insulting. The column is watertight and it does not primarily 
criticize Zhirinovskiy, but more the mass media and Paile. 
  ``Koskinen seems still to be living in the old Stalinist 
times when people were not allowed to criticize politicians at 
all. It is as if he believes that the Soviet Union still exists 
and that every attack on a Russian political leader leads to 
reprisals,'' Jutta Zilliacus countered.

<F P=106> [Article by Ola Hellblom, Agneta Jonsson, and Mosse Wallen: </F>
"Swedish Farmers Take the Bulk of the EU Money to the Nordic 
Countries"] 
  [Text] Swedish agriculture is the big winner in the 
European Union [EU] membership deal. Eight to 10 billion of the 
Swedish gross contribution of some 18 billion [Swedish] kronor 
[SKr] will be returned to the farmers. Swedish subsidies to 
agriculture amount this year to 3 billion in direct payments. 
Then there is the limit protection, estimated to be worth over 
SKr12 billion. 
  Sweden's state treasury will be the big looser in a possible 
EU membership. Even if we have succeeded in getting a so-called 
phasing-in subsidy in our membership agreement, the Swedish net 
contribution to EU's treasury is estimated at SKr6 billion 
during the first year. 
  Agriculture will, however, be a sure winner in an EU 
membership. The largest subsidy item from the EU will be the 
so-called acreage subsidy, which is paid out for maximally 1.8 
billion hectares. Total acreage subsidies, including fallow 
field grants, will be close to SKr4 billion. Animal subsidies 
will amount to nearly SKr500 million. 
  The other main form of grants is export subsidies and the 
possibility of selling surplus production at EU stockpile prices 
that are considerably above world market prices. Here, the 
effects on Swedish agriculture are difficult to estimate, 
considering the small scale of exports today. 
  Other great subsidy items are regional subsidies and grants 
to environmental programs, which both require national 
cofinancing. EU subsidies to environmental programs amount to 
SKr1.5 billion annually and require 50-percent cofinancing. 
Regional EU subsidies amount to SKr1 billion for northern 
Sweden and about SKr500 million for southern Sweden and require 
75-percent cofinancing. 
  The example of Denmark shows us that agriculture is the main 
beneficiary of an EU membership. Here, the farmers received 
SKr20 billion in export and other subsidies from the EU last 
year. Denmark has, due to its relatively large agricultural 
economy, also had a net surplus of about SKr2 billion per year 
during its more than 20 years of membership in the EU. 
<H5>  Norwegian Farmers Are Negative </H5>
  The Norwegian farmers do not want to join the EU. They 
represent today the most highly subsidized sector. The 
Norwegian farmer is kept sitting on his tractor with a good 
income of SKr11 billion per year. But the farmers remain 
negative in spite of continued assurances about good conditions. 
"We oppose membership for two reasons. We do not agree with 
the EU's basic philosophy to let market forces prevail and to 
accept expansion at any price," said Per Ole Ranberg at the 
Norwegian Framers' Union, one of the two agricultural 
organizations. 
  "Farming plays a completely different role in Norway than in 
Europe, where it only produces food. We must supply the country 
with food in times of emergency, we look after the environment, 
we safeguard quality and maintain an open cultural landscape. 
This makes our products very expensive and Norwegian farmers 
will be hit hard by EU prices. We also think that the 
government calculates the effect of the regional subsidies many 
times over. The total agricultural subsidy will in fact be 2 
billion less." 
  According to the government, Norway's agreement with the EU 
gives the farmers more or less the same economic conditions as 
before. EU's contribution amounts in various forms to SKr4.11 
billion and that of the Norwegian state to SKr5.74 billion, 
which makes a total of SKr9.85 billion. The state will, in 
addition, subsidize all farming to the north of the 62d parallel 
and to farmers south of the parallel, who farm in mountainous 
regions. 
  According to this year's agricultural agreement between the 
farmers and the state, national grants will continually be 
reduced down to SKr11 billion, which means that a readjustment 
to the world of the EU can hardly be dramatic. 
  According to EU rules the total permanent subsidies to 
agriculture may not exceed the present level. During some 
years, transitional rules will give the Norwegian farmer good 
possibilities to adapt himself to the European reality. But he 
does not want to. 
<H5>  Paavo Has Not Been Forgotten </H5>
  "Farmer Paavo, on his frosty homestead, high up on the sandy 
heaths of Saarijarvi, tilled his land with steady hands, waiting 
for the Good Lord to bless his crop." 
  Thus wrote the poet Runeberg. But that was a long time ago. 
For the Finnish farmer of today the Good Lord has been replaced 
by the state, i.e., the taxpayers and a subsidy system, which 
has been developed during the last 20 years to protect farming 
on frosty homesteads. 
  The subsidy system has to a large extent been developed by 
Heikki Haavisto, present foreign minister and long-time chairman 
of the farmers organization MTK [Central Union of Agricultural 
Producers], "Finland's LRF" [Federation of Swedish Farmers in 
Finland]. 
  Heikki Haavisto was the man in charge of Finland's EU 
negotiations in Brussels. 
  The Finnish agricultural subsidy system is today an almost 
impenetrable maze of paragraphs, which encumbers several budget 
items. It includes direct grants and subsidies in the form of 
tax and pension regulations, generation-change subsidies. The 
Ministry of Finance in Helsinki estimates that farmer Paavo 
costs today some SKr40 billion per year. 
  Finland's strained national budget is approximately SKr260 
billion. 
  While the rest of the population has been hit by the 
government's austerity program during the deep economic plunge, 
nobody has dared to touch agriculture. 
  Not so even now, on the threshold of the EU. On Thursday [26 
May], the government is expected to decide on an additional 
subsidy package to the farmers, a so-called national grant to 
keep the country's 150,000 farmers indemnified when life in the 
EU becomes reality and some other subsidies disappear. The 
subsidy amounts to SKr6.1 billion. 
  The expected decision has aroused anger among the employees, 
who think that farmer Paavo has had enough. Their argument is 
strengthened by indications that the Finnish national debt, 
today 370 billion and 55 percent of the GNP, will double before 
the turn of the century to become 100 percent of GNP. 
  There is one consolation however. The EU will probably not 
approve of permanent national subsidies to farmers.

<F P=106> [Article by Monica Bjorklund: "Dahl Fobs Off Liberal Party"] </F>
  [Text] Uppsala -- "With the policies the Liberal Party 
represents today I cannot imagine that the Social Democrats and 
Liberal Party will cooperate after the election." 
  This is what Birgitta Dahl, the Social Democratic Party 
[SDP] 
spokesperson on issues of social welfare, stated when SVENSKA 
DAGBLADET spoke with her on May Day. She had just taken Liberal 
leader Bengt Westerberg to task from the speaker's podium. 
  Previously, Social Democratic chairman Ingvar Carlsson and 
party secretary Mona Sahlin had repeatedly invited the Liberal 
Party to share the government after the election. 
<H5>  Greater Responsibility </H5>
  "It is not an invitation without demands," explains Birgitta 
Dahl, without wanting to go into what is required from the 
Liberal Party in order to be accepted as a governing partner. 
  From speaker's podiums in Enkoping and Uppsala, in the warm 
sun but icy wind, she criticized the nonsocialist government in 
general and the Liberal leader in particular. 
  ``As deputy prime minister and social minister he has a 
greater responsibility than most people for the social 
disarmament and the growing chasms in our country. 
  ``The policy that Bengt Westerberg is actively participating 
in is creating a segregation that is more merciless than the 
injustices of old times.'' 
<H5>  "Westerberg Is a Hypocrite" </H5>
  The Liberal leader himself on Friday [29 April] accused the 
Social Democrats of wanting to turn back the politics 20-30 
years in time. On the Liberal Party's election posters the 
Social Democrats are likened to a prehistoric lizard. And, 
according to Bengt Westerberg, it is the Social Democrats who 
have caused the segregation in society with the large, sterile 
housing areas of the their million-kronor program. 
  Birgitta Dahl tells SVENSKA DAGBLADET that Bengt Westerberg 
is a hypocrite and espouses a double moral. And the fact is that 
she is tougher in her criticism of the Liberal Party leader than 
of the leader of the Conservative Party. 
  "Carl Bildt, at least, says straight out what he wants. The 
Liberal, Center, and Christian Democratic parties say one thing 
-- pretending to be finer and nobler than others -- but do 
something entirely different. I think that is worse," says 
Birgitta Dahl from the podium. 
<H5>  Difficult Task </H5>
  She also warns that a difficult task awaits after an 
election 
victory. 
  "We cannot promise quick results. Even less can we promise 
material improvements -- restoration -- to anyone who is healthy 
and has a job." 
  On the other hand, she promises that the Social Democrats 
will tackle unemployment and, above all, youth unemployment. And 
there will be fairer taxes, with "proper taxation of capital 
gains from stocks," a special 5-percent defense tax for 
high-income earners and the possibility of raising the municipal 
tax for municipalities that need to. 
  She delivered two other clear messages: The child care 
subsidy will be eliminated immediately. No form of maid service 
deduction will be introduced by a Social Democratic government.

  [Text] PARIS, June 3 (AFP) -- The president of the 
opposition Democratic League of Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, was 
received Friday [3 June] in Paris by French Minister for 
European Affairs Alain Lamassoure, the French Foreign Ministry 
said. 
  The Ministry said the meeting underlined the attention Paris 
was paying to the situation in Kosovo, a Serb-administered 
province but whose population almost exclusively comprises 
ethnic Albanians. 
  Lamassoure said France favoured a policy of dialogue between 
communities in the province along with respect for human rights. 
  He added Paris supported internationally-recognised autonomy 
for Kosovo, which had been repealed by Belgrade in 1989. 
  Rugova told a press conference Thursday he hoped France 
would 
back the idea of establishing a United Nations protectorate in 
Kosovo, in line with a plan he proposed to the world body early 
last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Deger: "French MP's Fear U.S. Expansionism"] </F>
  [Text] French members of parliament [MP's] are worried by 
U.S. trade ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region and believe the 
Americans could use the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) as a springboard to further their aims there. This is 
at least the main conclusion that comes to mind when reading the 
report just released by a fact-finding delegation established by 
the National Assembly's Production and Trade Committee headed by 
Andre Santini (French Democratic Union -- UDF). The delegation 
looked into NAFTA's "economic impact both for participating 
countries and third-party countries." 
  According to delegation members, who visited Mexico, the 
United States, and Canada from 18 February to 1 March 1994 and 
met with numerous political and business officials, "since there 
are no geographical requirements, one cannot rule out potential 
integration of Asian countries...." Indeed, NAFTA is not 
geographically limited to the American continent. The report 
points out that "during preliminary talks, President Bush 
mentioned South Korea, Singapore, and even Australia as 
potential members." 
<H5>  NAFTA Courting South Korea </H5>
  Having completed their study, French MP's seem convinced 
that 
the next stage for NAFTA development will take place in South 
Korea, even though "the most obvious candidates are countries of 
the American continent." True, the U.S. Government could launch 
negotiations with Chile "and possibly Argentina in the 
not-too-distant future." However, "the impact of a potential 
extension of NAFTA to the south of the continent would be 
marginal since the volume of North American exports to this 
region is four times lower than to Europe and Asia." 
  On the other hand, "integration of Asian countries would 
definitely be harmful for Europe." Accordingly, even before it 
began writing its report, the delegation reportedly told the 
Foreign Ministry about this "American attempt at extending NAFTA 
to Asia." 
  "We must bear in mind the fact that NAFTA is nothing more 
than a free-trade agreement," a delegation member explained LA 
TRIBUNE. "The Americans are not faced with a `deepening vs. 
enlargement' dilemma. NAFTA membership criteria are quite 
flexible. There is no economic convergence requirement. The 
outlook is therefore relatively flexible." 
  This is why delegation members ask French and EU [European 
Union] authorities to "read between the lines," as NAFTA is a 
double-barreled trade weapon: "Mexico will be the gateway to 
South America, and South Korea the gateway to South East Asia."

  [Text] The Cameroon president was received by his French 
counterpart in Paris this afternoon. Cameroon has found it 
difficult to launch reforms demanded by international monetary 
institutions. President Biya has therefore come to ask Francois 
Mitterrand for economic support. The Cameroon president was 
optimistic when he left the Elysee Palace. Ghislaine Dupont 
asked him what lessons his country has drawn from the CFA 
[African Financial Community] franc devaluation: 
  [Begin Biya recording] It is still too soon to draw 
conclusions. There are some very negative aspects, such as 
unemployment and the decline in purchasing power. But at the 
same time, we note positive aspects, like, for instance, the 
increase in capital of some companies and the increase in 
exports. There is the prospect of an increase of agricultural 
products in rural areas. We also note that the gross national 
product, which was decreasing, has stabilized. All this, 
however, is still very fragile. We cannot draw conclusions 
after just three months. But we need more capital, through 
bilateral or multilateral agreements, to consolidate the 
positive aspects. It was this aspect that I raised with the 
president. I was happy to see that I was heard and I saw him 
[Mitterrand] giving instructions, so funds can be released as 
soon as possible. 
  There is hope. I will see other political figures. I will 
meet the prime minister tomorrow and I will see the finance 
minister in a short while. The Elysee has led me to believe 
that something will be done. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, June 3 (AFP) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev 
said Friday [3 June] he hoped the European Union [EU] would 
"finally turn to Kyrgyzstan" and help the former Soviet republic 
remain "the Central Asian Switzerland." 
  Akayev, who arrived in Paris Wednesday for a three-day 
official visit, used these terms to define the "island" of 
inter-ethnic peace and democracy in an "ocean of hurricanes" 
which is running the risk "of being submerged by a tidal wave 
without knowing where it will come from." 
  Speaking to an association of French and Russian 
journalists, 
he cited Moslem fundamentalism as one of the possible 
destabilising elements. He stressed such fundamentalism was not 
in the Kyrgyz tradition, but could "infiltrate from 
Afghanistan," via neighbouring Tajikistan which is being shaken 
by Islamic rebel attacks. 
  He also mentioned the narcotics business which, he warned, 
would turn his republic into the "Colombia of Central Asia" 
within a year or so if strong measures were not taken to stop it. 
  He recalled that Afghanistan is the world's second largest 
producer of opium behind Burma and that narcotics arrived in 
Paris or London via Tajikistan. He said he had asked the 
international community for help in "neutralising this 
distribution network." 
  Kyrgyzstan was once the Soviet Union's major producer of 
opium. 
  Akayev also said he backed the idea of a strong CIS which 
could become a "Eurasian Union" modelled on the EU. 
  Stressing that "Russia is and will remain Kyrgyzstan's main 
ally" he said he was convinced that Russia would be "reborn as a 
great 21st Century power." 
  Akayev brushed an idyllic picture of the state of democracy 
in his country where press freedom, the freedom of speech and 
human rights are scrupulously respected and where inter-ethnic 
peace reigns between more than 80 minority groups, including 
some very large ones: Russians, Uzbecks, Tatars, Koreans, 
Tajiks and Germans.

  [Excerpt] Paris, June 3 (AFP) -- Kyrgyzstan, the 
self-styled "Central Asian Switzerland," won a pledge of $550 
million from international aid donors Friday [3 June] as 
President Francois Mitterrand hailed the ex-Soviet republic's 
strides toward democracy. 
  The international financial community pledged to deliver the 
aid over the next 12 months but the funding might even be 
increased in the next few months, sources said at the Paris 
office of the World Bank. 
  The announcement came as Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev 
signed 
the Paris Charter of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe on the third and final day of a visit here. 
  Kyrgyzstan's donors include France, Germany, Japan, Russia, 
and the United States, as well as a dozen international 
organizations. 
  The donors meeting in the French capital welcomed 
application 
in the small republic of 4.5 million people of a program of the 
International Monetary Fund in the wake of the collapse of the 
Kyrgyz economy following the breakup of the Soviet Bloc. But 
they insisted on the need for speeding up industrial 
restructuring efforts and for strengthening the social security 
system. 
  Kyrgyzstan is also trying to attract foreign investors, and 
Akayev told some French business leaders on Friday that his 
republic would be "a good bridgehead for an effort to conquer 
Central Asian markets." 
  Mitterrand hailed the country for making "a real effort" to 
move "toward a democratic status" after Akayev signed the 
Charter at the Elysee Palace, a document which the French 
president described as "the act by which the Cold War ended." 
  Akayev said he hoped the European Union would help his 
country remain "the Central Asian Switzerland." [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Balladur's `Different Society'"] </F>
  [Text] In the Paris Conference Center yesterday, Edouard 
Balladur delivered the closing speech at the colloquium 
organized by the Polytechnic to celebrate the school's 
bicentenary. Asked to imagine the future and develop a few 
prospects for the 21st century, the prime minister above all 
transposed his policy into the future, thus giving the broad 
outlines of a presidential program. 
  "The march toward a different society has started." Without 
wishing to reopen the debate on change, Edouard Balladur is 
taking advantage of all his public speeches to show that his 
arrival at the Hotel Matignon [office of the prime minister] 
marked a break with the "old-fashioned" society he inherited 
after the March 1993 parliamentary elections. These statements 
have an increasingly presidential tone which certainly irritates 
the friends of Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris. Last summer, 
this projection into the future of the prime minister's action 
caused a strong reaction among Chirac's supporters. Jean-Louis 
Debre, deputy secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic], and Bernard Pons, president of the RPR caucus in the 
National Assembly, had no hesitation in bringing out the big 
guns and firing point blank at this government chief who was 
simply placed in the Matignon to run everyday business until the 
presidential election. "The real change," they maintained with 
anger, "can only come after the crucial election." In other 
words, in their thinking, once Jacques Chirac has been installed 
within the Elysee. "Wrong," the Matignon retorted. "The real 
change came in March 1993 with the French people's choice of a 
different majority and a different society." 
  The debate then became bogged down, with nobody standing to 
gain from provoking a sudden split in the majority. However, 
each camp was on the alert, keeping one eye permanently on the 
fluctuations in the opinion polls. To calm things down, Edouard 
Balladur firmly urged his ministers to respect a strict duty of 
restraint: There was no question of publicly discussing the 
presidential election before the end of 1994. "The French 
people have other concerns and expect something different from 
you," he stressed. 
<H5>  Trial Run </H5>
  And yet it is he who for several weeks now has launched into 
the trial run of a possible presidential candidate. First, by 
little comments, tackling the subject of the "new society" which 
was quickly turned (to avoid being reminiscent of Jacques 
Chaban-Delmas' campaign) into a "different society." Yesterday, 
speaking to the "RPR elite" assembled to celebrate the 
bicentenary of the Polytechnic School, he clearly took a further 
step. Increasingly specific in his statements, he outlined the 
"different society" he is now establishing in order to open the 
doors to the next century. Who but he could be at the helm to 
continue this trajectory? 
  "Globalization is a challenge to the state and I want to 
explain how I conceive of the state's necessary evolution faced 
with this challenge," he said. "In a world which has changed 
everything, the state can no longer have the same goals, nor can 
it centralize all the powers and make all the decisions. Its 
mission is to structure a different society which makes it 
possible for all to progress, and which makes possible the 
solidarity and defense of the nation. This is a huge task." 
  First, there is peacekeeping. "Immigration, separatism, 
ethnic and religious conflicts are undermining national unity on 
all sides and call democracy into question." It is therefore 
necessary to establish an "trade organization which ensures 
respect for the rules of international competition, and does not 
give too prominent a role to the countries which are least 
concerned with social justice. That is why it is necessary to 
set up a stable international monetary system.... This is why I 
took the initiative of the pact for stability in Europe." 
  What about employment and social protection? "We must invent 
a different society which is not a reproduction of past models. 
We must renew the social contract of the Age of Enlightenment 
by inventing new forms of solidarity." This is the whole 
meaning of regional development policy, urban policy, and social 
policy. "Guaranteeing solidarity depends on a social policy 
which reverses the current demographic trend, by more effective 
social security, but one which is better organized and whose 
costs are better controlled in terms of retirement and health 
care. French society must be able to benefit from medical 
advances without the social security system being threatened. 
Work must be better organized, more effectively distributed, 
for instance by easing administrative constraints." 
  It is therefore a whole long-term program which Edouard 
Balladur set out. He did so in the name of the government and 
the whole majority which supports him. His outlook is the year 
2010. Although he still denies -- but increasingly weakly -- 
that he is officially a presidential candidate, he is 
nonetheless taking every opportunity to show himself to be one.

<F P=106> [Article signed G.C.: "The Deputies Have Adopted the </F>
Military Programming Law"] 
  [Text] In a joint move, unusual but predictable, the 
majority and Socialist Party [PSF] deputies adopted--on 
Wednesday 1 June--the military programming law on which the 
National Assembly first voted on 24 and 25 May. The final 
vote--which was due to take place on Tuesday, 31 May--was 
finally postponed by one day after Assembly Speaker Philippe 
Seguin noticed both the absence of the defense minister from 
government benches and...the failure of the electronic voting 
system. 
  Only the Communist deputies voted against the bill, with Guy 
Hermier (Bouches-du-Rhone) expressing the view that France "is 
wasting a historic opportunity to take a decisive step toward 
disarmament and peace." Two absentees were noted: Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement who had announced his intention of abstaining, as 
did Jean-Pierre Michel, his friend from the Citizens' Movement; 
and also that of Julien Dray who did this to express his 
opposition to the text and its approval by the PS [Socialist 
Party]. In the forthcoming issue of the weekly pamphlet GAUCHE 
SOCIALISTE [Socialist Left] which they edit, Julien Dray and 
Jean-Luc Melenchon, (PS) senator for l'Essonne, write that 
"voting in favor of this law is stupid, politically dangerous, 
and militarily ineffective." 
  Welcoming the "support" of the country's three big political 
forces for his bill, Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
reaffirmed the government's position on nuclear tests. France, 
he said, intends "to maintain its nuclear effort, and that 
includes tests if they seem necessary."

<F P=106> [Article by Herve Laumont: "France Declares War on Dirty </F>
Money" 
  [Excerpts] An interministerial committee is scheduled 
today to examine a new anticorruption program based on proposals 
by Judge Jean-Pierre, who was assigned last December to devise 
uniform procedures for and step up the fight against dirty 
money. 
  [Passage omitted] Thierry Jean-Pierre's report develops 
several proposals for effectively combatting the mafia 
organizations that have moved into France from all over the 
world. 
  Existing agencies are plagued by a number of problems, 
including lack of information and coordination among 
investigatory and preventative agencies, the slowness of 
proceedings and international rogatory commissions, and poor 
cooperation from banks. This inadequate organization has 
severely hampered their efforts. Moreover, no fewer than six 
separate bodies, with little or no liaison between them, have 
been expected to fight crime that has become increasingly 
organized. 
  How can investigators flush out a front company hidden in 
one 
of the world's 20 tax havens, or expose a customer who is 
laundering several hundreds of thousands of dollars through the 
foreign subsidiary of a French bank, when the laws of that 
country do not require the bank to report suspicious deposits? 
Not to mention the fact that Italian, Russian, Asian, and now 
East European mafias have established a foothold in France. 
  Judge Jean-Pierre's proposals, which today's 
interministerial 
meeting is expected to ratify, attack just such problems. They 
are part of a sweeping plan to revamp the judiciary that calls 
for creating specialized economic and financial jurisdictions in 
each big region of France by the end of the year. Right now, 
makeshift versions of such units exist only in Paris, 
Marseilles, and Lyon. 
  The judges who will preside over these jurisdictions will 
receive specific training and will be backed by intervention 
forces composed of police officers, gendarmes (police militia), 
and tax and customs agents. They will also have access to a 
central documentation agency--called DESC, for Specialized Crime 
Research Department--that will serve as a national clearinghouse 
for all information on dubious financial channels, phony 
bankruptcies, and individuals to monitor. This new organization 
to combat organized financial crime is actually the first step 
toward the medium-term goal of creating a European agency. 
Already, occasional operations involving European collaboration 
have paid off. 
  The Russian Interior Ministry has just forwarded the first 
official request for judicial cooperation to the Chancellery via 
Interpol and French diplomatic agencies. The request concerns a 
Russian businessman living in the 17th District of Paris and 
suspected of receiving sizable sums from Russia via the 
English-Norman islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and Man, for 
transfer to Switzerland and Monaco. Some of the money was 
reportedly used to purchase a restaurant in Lille Street.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Police To Get 8 Billion French </F>
Francs Over Five Years"--first three paragraphs are LE MONDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] The interior minister presented a sweeping plan to 
improve France's domestic security during a "roundtable" that 
was held on Thursday, 28 April. The meeting was part of the 
mission Charles Pasqua delegated to his close collaborator, 
state advisor Pierre Bordry (see LE MONDE, 14 November, 1993), 
to reflect on and make proposals concerning internal security 
issues. 

  -  MODERNIZATION--The minister unveiled the broad 
outlines of his draft orientation and program bill for the 
national police before a gathering of law and order 
organizations. His audience included the Independent Federation 
of Police Trade Unions (FASP, a left-wing organization that 
represents the majority of noncommissioned officers and police 
officers); the National Independent Police Federation (FNAP, a 
moderate association representing most "nonmilitary" police 
inspectors and superintendents); the Union of Trade Unions for 
Specific Divisions (USC, the second-ranking, right-wing 
organization of "police in uniform"); and all the directors of 
the national police. 
  -  MULTIYEAR PLANS--That same morning, the 
prime minister promised Charles Pasqua that his reform would be 
funded by a budget package of 8 billion francs [FR] over five 
years. 

  Charles Pasqua wants his draft orientation and 
program/appropriations bill for the police to "not only 
highlight the social role of police officers and bring them 
closer to the French people, but to lay the foundation of a new, 
national police organization; change its working conditions; and 
provide it with the resources it needs in terms of personnel, 
equipment, and methodology to lay the groundwork for the police 
force of the 21st century." But the minister's ambitions are 
actually even grander in scale: the Pasqua plan affects all 
state or private employees that play a role in France's domestic 
security. This includes the national police and gendarmerie, 
customs, prison administration, municipal police, and security 
or fund-transfer companies. 
  Indeed, although the plan's central focus is the national 
police, the minister's comprehensive approach aims to clarify 
the areas over which various players have jurisdiction. However, 
Pasqua was careful to put off until later detailed discussions 
of questions that normally stir up passions. 
  The National Police and Gendarmerie The safety of 
citizens is the exclusive responsibility of the state, the 
minister asserted; his bill unambiguously confirms this as the 
sovereign mission of the national police and gendarmery. 
However, the prickly question of the respective territorial 
jurisdictions of the latter will be referred to a decree before 
the Council of State. For the last 50 years, the constabulary 
supposedly has had jurisdiction over communes with fewer than 
10,000 inhabitants, but the accelerated urbanization of the last 
few decades has left that principle a bit worse for wear. 
  Customs and Prison Personnel Customs officers have 
an acknowledged domestic security role to play in specific areas 
such as the fight against narcotics trafficking, "dirty" money 
laundering, and even illegal immigration. But the minister is 
opposed to their demand to become officers of the Criminal 
Investigation Unit (CIUO). Moreover, says the minister, the 
prison system will take charge of prisoners as soon as they are 
turned over to the justice system, thereby freeing police 
officers from "unnecessary tasks" (escorting and guarding 
prisoners) that consume police personnel. According to Pasqua, 
1,500 penitentiary staff jobs--which fall under the Justice 
Ministry--will be created over the next three years. To get 
active police officers out of the station house, the minister 
also announced that approximately 1,000 administrative and 
technical personnel a year would be recruited over the next five 
years. 
  Municipal Police and Security Companies There is 
no question of the state withdrawing from security, the minister 
insisted, thus quashing "remedies" proposed by boosters of the 
municipal police, especially from his own political camp. 
Municipal police force action will be limited to infractions 
that fall under local law and to the execution of decisions 
signed by the mayor. Certain tasks that until now had been 
performed by French state police, among them lost-and-found, 
animal impounding, lost identification papers, and proxy votes, 
will be transfered to the "municipals." A specific law 
concerning the municipal police will be presented to parliament 
at a later date, said the minister, who was probably anxious to 
end the debates raging within the majority, notably concerning 
Paris. The minister also postponed a separate bill on the 
status, jurisdiction, and recruitment of private security guard 
and money-transport companies, which also fall within the scope 
of the Pasqua bill. 
  Five-Year Modernization Plan To successfully 
modernize the police, Pasqua extracted assurances from the prime 
minister that he would have a five-year program plan allocating 
Fr8 billion. This is less than what the police unions, who 
expected Pasqua to come up with a package of Fr11 billion over 
five years, had counted on. But the minister's office compares 
the Pasqua plan to the military program/appropriations bill, and 
says it will be adjustable and renewable every five years. A 
"watchdog committee" to monitor the budget plan will be set up 
for the Interior Ministry, which, unlike the Defense Ministry, 
will not have an ad hoc committee in Parliament. The Pasqua 
plan, which is comparable to the modernization bill launched in 
1986 by then-Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, will target real 
property, vehicles, transmission, data-processing, and more 
protective gear for the CRS's [riot police]. 
  Police Officer Professional Statute To stem 
grumbling among police troops, the minister has promised that a 
recognized "professional statute" will be written into the law. 
This statute, which partially repeals civil service provisions, 
will make it possible to jointly negotiate compensation and 
promotional opportunities--in other words, to escape the ax of 
the budget and civil service ministries--the FASP happily noted. 
  The minister also mentioned that extra compensation would be 
awarded to street officers with difficult jobs in certain urban 
areas. Pasqua cited the anticrime squads, which specialize in 
"surprise sweeps." The FASP would like to see rescue 
officers--"a job that is at least as risky"--benefit as well. 
Discussion of specialized unit issues and of others, notably 
measures to provide low-cost housing for police, is still open; 
the minister invited the unions to an upcoming meeting in 
mid-May. Pasqua noted that his law would be debated during the 
ordinary session of parliament that has just opened. 
  Finally, when it comes to the well-worn issue of a 
professional career track, the minister proposed a simplified 
system organized into three professional corps: a top management 
corps (superintendents); a command and supervisory corps 
(inspectors, commanders, and officers); and an enforcement corps 
(all other police categories, essentially NCOs and police 
officers). Pasqua's reform is pushing to break down the walls 
between "civilians" and "police in uniform," whose officers and 
commanders will be accorded to status of CIUO.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Deputy Mirko Tremaglia, </F>
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of 
Deputies, by Stefano Mensurati in Rome; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Tremaglia] We really must 
achieve a strengthening of European political union, which 
cannot be confined to the Maastricht Treaty, which is 
restrictive. To build European unity with the help of all the 
continent's countries, from those of EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] -- which include Norway -- to those of East Europe. 
These latter must be free to decide independently on NATO 
membership -- without any vetoes from Russia -- which is partly 
supported by the United States, though Clinton has now softened 
his stances, by moving on from "if" to "when" the countries of 
the East can join the Atlantic alliance. I have argued the need 
to take account of the problems being experienced by Russia, 
whose intervention in the conflicts in the republics of the 
former Soviet Union are to some extent understandable. Then 
there is the problem of the Russian minorities, not to mention 
the still unresolved issue of the dismantling of nuclear 
weapons. These statements were appreciated by all the 
delegations and may have helped the Norwegians to understand 
that perhaps some people went too far. 
  [Mensurati] The atmosphere was already different by the time 
you left. 
  [Tremaglia] Yes, indeed. The chairman of the Norwegian 
parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Blankenborg, a 
Laborite, said: "I have no intention of taking part in a witch 
hunt and of persecuting someone because of his past. Mr. 
Tremaglia must be judged on the basis of his ideas now." He was 
supported in this by the daily, AFTENPOSTEN, in an editorial 
which stated among other things: "Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore 
Godal recently said that he does not want any meetings with 
neofascist members of the Italian Government. Immediately 
afterward he went to China to shake hands with the very same 
people who trampled the democratic forces only a few years ago. 
It seems that `the name is worse than the action,' that the 
name `neofascist' is a greater problem than the real conditions 
created by `a totalitarian, barbaric, and regressively Marxist 
China.' This shows that we can legitimately expect to be judged 
on the basis of our deeds." 
  [Mensurati] This responsible stance was also adopted by 
American President Clinton. 
  [Tremaglia] The final echoes of the dispute will end with 
the 
major electoral blow that will fall on the left-wing forces in a 
week's time. I would say that Clinton's remarks are perfect. 
He said that he felt like an Italian citizen and, in view of 
the need for change, he said, with regard to the prime minister: 
"Let us allow him to work and support him." With specific 
reference to the AN ministers, he put an end to all speculation: 
"In a democracy different parties have their roots in the past, 
and people must be judged on what they do, not on their labels." 
  Clinton's remarks have put an end to a passing phase, so no 
more interference, especially from the French president, who 
would do better to concern himself right now with France's 
serious responsibility for what is happening in Rwanda, the arms 
trafficking which preceded the massacre, and for which previous 
Italian governments also bear their share of responsibility. 
  [Mensurati] With regard to Rwanda, two days ago the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously 
approved a document submitted by its chairman. 
  [Tremaglia] There is a certain style and tradition in the 
Foreign Affairs Committee that I want to encourage: The 
nation's problems come before partisan considerations. 
  The issue under discussion was this disastrous situation in 
Rwanda, and I called for the foreign minister to speak, and he 
promptly addressed the committee. So the first meeting was 
attended by Martino and his under secretaries. The proceedings 
were of a very high standard. Everyone approved the resolution, 
with no exceptions. This was a satisfying conclusion for me, 
from a personal viewpoint too, after some disappointments. 
  [Mensurati] Which we will pass over... 
  [Tremaglia] ...no, we will return to them, to express my 
absolute determination to fight with Italians around the world 
for the defense of their rights, and more besides. I very much 
wanted, I would say I built, this ministry for expatriate 
Italians, in order to set in motion a comprehensive policy 
involving our fellow countrymen at all levels in the media and 
in the field of promulgating our culture, in the field of 
economic cooperation, and in the field of organizations. 
  [Mensurati] Clinton's visit to Italy was scheduled a long 
time ago, but nevertheless it is taking place at a time of major 
political developments. What is your opinion of it? 
  [Tremaglia] The visit signifies several different things, 
and 
I will not try to evade them. It recalls the time of war, but 
it is an important political act, with respect to Italy too. 
Clinton said he is anxious to have contacts with our 
government. I must say that this visit also prompts a serious 
reflection. That is, the civil war between the nations of 
Europe and the civil war in Italy ended 50 years ago. So this 
is a great act -- in both ethical and political terms -- of 
reconciliation among all the European states and among the 
Italian people. We have always felt this need for 
reconciliation by paying tribute to the fallen, without partisan 
distinctions, and by demanding respect for the living who fought 
on both sides. As happened at Montecassino, where on 19 May 
there were not only Italians present, but representatives of all 
the foreign armies that fought there 50 years ago. 
  This is the attitude with which, with great enthusiasm, I 
regard Clinton's arrival in Italy. He is a president that has 
displayed great sensitivity, the ability to understand that only 
within mutual respect and a solid alliance without any first- 
and second-class distinctions can we confront, with 
determination and the necessary compactness, the challenges that 
face us at the international level.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlo Rossella: "Keep Your Mouth Shut; the Enemy </F>
Is Watching You!"] 
  [Text] Is everyone against Italy? Not exactly: 
Clinton and Kohl have adopted a wait-and-see attitude; Mitterand 
is putting his thoughts in writing; Israel is divided on the 
subject; and Lady Thatcher offers advice. Following the 
controversial vote in Strasbourg, here is an analysis of some of 
the expressions of hostility, praise, and fear emanating from 
our allies. 
  In the diplomatic jargon of Washington it is called a 
"one-man memo" [preceding two words in English]--a report 
drafted by one person. The title of the approximately 50-page 
document is quite unambiguous: "The Neofascist Peril in Italy 
and in Europe." It was written by an official of the State 
Department shortly before the 27 March elections. The pamphlet 
never reached the top levels of the U.S. foreign policy 
establishment--i.e., the offices of Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and his deputy Strobe Talbott--but it was read and 
reread by many government officials. The aforementioned analyst 
maintained that although Gianfranco Fini's party has changed its 
name it is still in the mainstream of the European far Right, 
which is revanchist, neopopulist, and hostile to the values of 
the democratic west. 
  The analyst's report was presumably compiled from 
information 
obtained in Rome and in Washington based on CIA intelligence or 
on some of the numerous essays published in the United States 
following Vladimir Zhirinovsky's victory in the Russian 
elections. It is quite possible that the report will reach Bill 
Clinton's desk before Clinton's two trips to Italy. The American 
president will visit Rome on 2 and 3 June to celebrate the 
allied landings at Anzio, and he will be in Italy again from 8 
to 10 July for the G-7 summit in Naples. In only three 
weeks--when Clinton makes his first visit--Silvio Berlusconi 
will learn whether the campaign of the hostile press--and the 
pressures from liberal circles and diplomats abroad--have had an 
effect on the president of the United States. Neither the White 
House--nor, for that matter, the U.S. embassy in Rome, headed by 
the able Reginald Bartholomew--has subscribed to the fears and 
denunciations expressed by representatives of other allied 
countries at the inclusion, in the cabinet, of members of the 
National Alliance. Bartholomew has, however, told a high-ranking 
official of the Italian Government that it would be very 
embarrassing for Clinton to commemorate the bloody battle of 
Anzio--which the Americans fought against the Nazi troops in 
January 1944--in the presence of the heirs of Il Duce. 
  Aside from this problem, however, the United States is 
waiting to assess the new government on the basis of the facts. 
It expects that none of the National Alliance ministers will 
prove to be someone who has avowed Fascist sympathies. It 
predicts that Italy will continue to be a loyal friend within 
NATO. It hopes that all the international commitments--including 
the Osimo Treaty with the former Yugoslavia--will be kept. "To 
be sure," Angelo Codevilla, one of the gurus from the Hoover 
Institution acknowledges, "the stories filed by the American 
reporters from Rome and the newspaper headlines--such as the one 
in THE NEW YORK TIMES, which proclaimed the return of the 
fascists [preceding word in English] to the government--are a 
matter of concern to the public, but Americans are not getting 
shivers down their spine the way some Europeans are. Perhaps 
Fini is truly taking the far Right toward the center. Perhaps he 
will succeed in getting his followers to remove their black 
shirts and put on business suits. Let's give him a trial period 
of a few months." 
  In Strasbourg--where the election campaign for the new 
European Parliament is already heating up--the climate is quite 
different from Washington's somewhat detached wait-and-see 
attitude. As the politicians who meet in Rome with the 
ambassadors from the European Union [EU] point out, there are 
those who perceive "the danger of a resurgence of the far Right 
in Europe" and make little distinction between fascists, 
neofascists, and the postfascists of the National Alliance. A 
substantial lobbying [preceding word in English] operation by 
Achille Occhetto and associates led--on the night of Wednesday 4 
May-Thursday 5 May--to a motion of censure (189 votes to 188) 
directed against the inclusion of Fini's people in the Italian 
Government. 
  While some were recalling that a similar blitz [preceding 
word in English] waged by the European Left had led to approval 
of the rules concerning the adoption of children by gay 
[preceding word in English] couples--and while the Palazzo 
Quirinale [office of the president of Italy] was issuing a 
speedy reply opposing any interference (President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro wrote: "Italy does not need either warnings or 
teachers")--Occhetto was toasting his victory. The PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] leader (who is no longer a 
prophet in his own country) is happy to have found--on the 
international scene--a new legitimation. The European election 
campaign in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, and Great Britain 
will be waged by the parties of the Left on the issue of the 
qualunquista [man-in-the-street] threat, and Gianfranco Fini is 
saying the same thing. "The first to open fire," he told 
PANORAMA, "was Michel Rocard, secretary of the French Socialist 
Party, and precisely for internal party reasons, inasmuch as he 
fears Bernard Tapie. Then all the others chimed in." 
  Major European newspapers have likewise taken very hard-line 
positions with regard to Italian neofascism, which has the 
potential of replicating or reinforcing similar phenomena 
elsewhere on the continent. Alain Minc began the process with an 
article in LE MONDE and was followed by many commentators, from 
the Italianist Michael Sheridan--writing in the London 
INDEPENDENT--to Miguel A. Bastenier in PAIS of Madrid and the 
scholarly history lessons in DIE ZEIT of Hamburg. Although some 
correspondents in Rome may perhaps be influenced by the "Red 
salons," as Fini says, or by the "outbursts of REPUBBLICA or 
other similar newspapers," as the secretary of the National 
Alliance also claims, the analysts are capturing the moods of 
the various foreign ministries and economic potentates. The 
parties of the left are shouting, while government officials are 
voicing their opinions in more subdued tones. 
  The Germans, for example--as Helmut Kohl told some friends 
during his visit to Rome on Tuesday 3 May--fear not only the 
Fini effect on the Republikaner in the coming elections but also 
the possibility that Italy might play a bad joke on the 
economy--for example, by making agreements with Alcatel 
concerning STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company] while ignoring 
Siemens. Bonn is preparing to preside over the EC for six months 
and will keep close watch on Rome--on Rome's observance of its 
European commitments and on its compliance with the rules of 
economic and moral austerity that are necessary in order to 
solve Italy's serious problems. Slovenes and Croats have turned 
not only to Washington but also to Bonn to obtain protection 
from any revision of the Osimo Treaty ("which," Fini told 
PANORAMA, "must be revised as it pertains to the protection of 
the rights of the Italian minorities." 
  London--where Italy is represented by an ambassador of great 
prestige, Giacomo Attolico--is not monitoring the handful of 
National Alliance ministers as attentively as it is 
"Berlusconi's performance." It is up to him, the newspapers 
explain--and the Foreign Office chimes in--to keep "the 
postneofascists" at bay. The British ambassador in Rome, Sir 
Patrick Fairweather, met privately with Fini precisely in an 
effort to understand him. On Monday 2 May, at the Italian 
Cultural Institute in London, a crowded meeting of political 
scientists and analysts heard a lecture on the new Italy given 
by Professor Carlo Maria Santoro of the ISPI [Foreign Policy 
Studies Institute] of Milan. At the meeting, attention was 
centered on the new electoral system and on the new government 
coalition. PANORAMA has learned that Prince Charles will invite 
Berlusconi to visit him at his private country estate, 
Highgrove, outside London, and Prime Minister John Major has 
sent a message to Berlusconi expressing "best wishes for the 
formation of your ministerial team." 
  Whereas London is merely smiling, the face that Paris and 
Brussels (where the Frenchman Jacques Delors reigns) have turned 
toward this "black-garbed" Italy is wearing a frown. The 
transalpine press--except for LE FIGARO--is decidedly hostile. 
Even some conservative politicians such as the mayor of Paris, 
Jacques Chirac, are unusually cautious (on his recent visit to 
Rome, Chirac did not want to meet with any National Alliance 
representative). Francois Mitterrand sent Berlusconi a telegram 
of congratulations, and his foreign minister, Alain Juppe, 
displayed a measure of realpolitik toward the new Italian 
Government. The Socialists, however, have gone wild. Jean-Pierre 
Cot, group leader of the Socialists in the European Parliament, 
led the anti-Fini campaign. Former cabinet minister Bernard 
Kouchner headed a drive to collect signatures in opposition to 
"Italian neofascism." In the intellectual salons of the Left, 
Italy--which had just held normal democratic elections--was in 
fact likened to the Greece of the colonels and the Chile of 
Augusto Pinochet. 
  Even the Jewish communities reacted strongly to the "Fini 
threat." Jean Kahn, president of the European Jewish Congress, 
said: "The European Community was created on the basis of the 
European Human Rights Convention, and it would be unacceptable 
for the fascists to be part of a government of the EU." Like a 
chain reaction, the alarm sounded by the French Jews unleashed 
the powerful lobby [preceding word in English] in America. 
"These events concern and disturb me very greatly," Fini told 
PANORAMA. "I have already had a heart-to-heart talk with many 
Jewish friends, and will do the same with the Italian, American, 
and French communities. If it can be arranged, I will even go to 
Israel. I say to everyone that we are not anti-Semites and that 
we love freedom and democracy." 
  The conservative Israeli daily JERUSALEM POST indicates that 
it believes Fini is acting in good faith. In an editorial of 31 
March it wrote: "He is a courteous person, who became the center 
of attention after combating the extremist fringe of his party. 
He is certainly no Zhirinovskiy." Shimon Peres, who met 
Berlusconi in 1985, is monitoring the Italian situation with 
Biblical realism and is awaiting [Foreign Minister] Martino's 
visit to Israel. Italy has been scrutinized attentively in 
Jerusalem as well as in Washington. The Western foreign 
ministries--more so than the newspapers--have concentrated on 
reality rather than on their imagination. They are waiting for 
the names of the ministers and the program of the government to 
be announced. 
  As Margaret Thatcher has informed PANORAMA, the following 
will be of great importance for the world and also for Italy: 
the actions that Berlusconi takes during the first 100 days, the 
first promises that are carried out, and the day-to-day 
performance of the ministers of the coalition regardless of 
their political affiliation. And if the Iron Lady--who governed 
for 11 and one-half years--says so, it is indeed good advice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio by </F>
Federico Guiglia; place and date not given: "Too Many Wise Guys 
in the Senate" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- The result was an 8-5 victory for the 
opposition. The defeated majority inevitably took issue with 
the referee of the match they had just lost in the Senate. They 
accused [Senate speaker] Carlo Scognamiglio of ignoring the 
fouls committed by the Left, by permitting the establishment of 
a new parliamentary group which at the last moment disrupted the 
precarious balance among the committees. Giovanni Spadolini's 
successor as speaker of the Senate was not troubled by the 
criticisms or surprised by the outcome. Before attending the 
dinner given in Clinton's honor, in his first interview with IL 
GIORNALE he explained why the controversial clash in the Senate 
may in fact have buried associationism forever. "The British 
would argue that `rule abuse' [two preceding words in English], 
what we Italians would call a trick, occurred in this instance," 
he said. "But abuse of the rules cannot be sanctioned by the 
speaker. The obvious shortcomings of regulations that are now 
obsolete permit a group of 10 senators to be represented on all 
13 committees. The opposition exploited this fact. But the 
craftiness displayed -- and of course we may not have a good 
opinion of it -- was not decisive." 
  [Guiglia] Why was it not decisive, if the government forces 
were defeated? 
  [Scognamiglio] It was not the numbers that were the crucial 
factor in the majority's defeat. Proportionately, the 
government forces obtained more or less their due number of 
votes in the Senate. Nothing different happened from what we 
already know. People place too much emphasis on the committees, 
forgetting that the Senate as a whole is independent. Now the 
Senate can act as a "cooling chamber": The majority will have 
to reflect on what measures to present. With no excesses. 
  [Guiglia] Having left through the door, is associationism 
reentering through the window? 
  [Scognamiglio] On the contrary, we are moving toward a 
complete democracy. The minority's rights are protected, just 
as the government majority is now encouraged to make good laws. 
  [Guiglia] Let us try to undermine your optimism: The Senate 
is turning down that which the Chamber of Deputies approves, and 
vice versa. Are we moving toward an early election? 
  [Scognamiglio] If there is a threat of filibustering, it 
means that the minority will have abused its rights, by not 
permitting the normal functioning of democracy. In such an 
eventuality, all the necessary conclusions will have to be drawn. 
  [Guiglia] But will the Marxist Carpi, the new chairman of 
the 
Industry Committee, ever be able to agree to privatization? 
  [Scognamiglio] The same rules apply to him as apply to me. 
Since becoming head of the Senate I have ceased to be a Liberal. 
I hope that Senator Carpi will do the same with Marxism. 
  [Guiglia] With regard to ideology, how to explain the 
anti-Italian campaign unleashed abroad under the banner of 
antifascism? 
  [Scognamiglio] I have no idea how it originated. Be that as 
it may, a section of the foreign press is misrepresentating the 
real situation in Italy. Italy is suffering an injustice, which 
will be remedied in time and in practice. 
  [Guiglia] This prejudice is taking root in Europe, but not 
in 
America. Is this a coincidence, or is there a historical and 
political difference? 
  [Scognamiglio] In the United States, as in Italy, there is 
no 
danger of the growth of a nondemocratic right-wing party. 
Unfortunately this danger does exist in France, Germany, and 
Denmark, and it is probably this that causes the greatest 
anxieties. 
  [Guiglia] You were elected as an innovation in the Second 
Republic. What changes have there been, will there be, in the 
proceedings of the Senate? 
  [Scognamiglio] No laws have been passed yet. I think I have 
displayed respect for the rules and for the people's will, which 
is an area in which it is better that there be no "innovations." 
  [Guiglia] Well, Irene Pivetti, the speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies, is proving more active than her predecessors. Which 
are better: "figurehead" speakers, as in the past, or 
"interventionist" ones? 
  [Scognamiglio] If you are referring to Pivetti's initiative 
in favor of Rwanda, I consider it appropriate. The two 
parliamentary houses have the power to "address," and the appeal 
made to the government by the Chamber of Deputies Speaker 
certainly expressed the general feeling of the nation. I would 
not talk in terms of activism and passivity. With the end of 
associationism, the speakers of the assemblies no longer have 
the sole role of mediating between majority and opposition. 
They now have the role of guaranteeing the diversity of 
expression of majority and opposition. 
  [Guiglia] Has the time come to carry out the grand reform, 
or 
has that time passed? 
  [Scognamiglio] I believe that the Italian people voted 
pragmatically. Senators and deputies were elected in order to 
have a good government, not in order to carry out the grand 
reform. If the government does well, the changes will come in 
due course. Otherwise, the issue of the major rules will return 
to the forefront. 
  [Guiglia] Can President Scalfaro remain in his post after 
his 
statements last Sunday [28 May] about "institutional purposes?" 
  [Scognamiglio] I have already said that the president 
remains 
the focal point despite the evident inconsistencies introduced 
by the first-past-the-post electoral system. If the president 
were to resign, his successor would be the expression of a 
political majority to which he would ultimately be 
"subordinate." The very fact that Scalfaro is the expression of 
a political majority that no longer exists ensures that this 
hypothetical problem does not arise. I fully agree with what 
the haed of state said: He can only be set aside if and when 
there are changes to the Constitution that affect the presidency. 
  [Guiglia] But is there not an "ethical issue" regarding the 
president? 
  [Scognamiglio] I see no ethical issue regarding the 
president. 
  [Guiglia] In abstract terms, are you in favor of the direct 
election of the head of state? 
  [Scognamiglio] I would say that it is consistent with the 
method for electing parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Alessandro Caprettini; place and date not given: "Rest Assured, 
We Will Not Go Back to the Polls" -- first four paragraphs are 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- Yes, the majority has lost some ground, but 
we must not dramatize things. [National Alliance leader] 
Gianfranco Fini professes to be optimistic. 
  He does not believe the rumors concerning gathering storms, 
and he seems to rule out further elections, a possibility which 
-- rumor has it -- some Forza Italia members may have been 
contemplating. 
  In any case, in order to avoid further jolts, Fini is making 
haste to wear the hat of the patient mediator between an 
aggressive Nothern League Secretary Bossi and a haywire Prime 
Minister Berlusconi. 
  Thus he is facing up to those constantly reproaching him for 
being nostalgic about rough woolen cloth and high boots 
[reference to fascist uniform]. 
  [Caprettini] The committee war in the Senate, quarrels, 
mutual accusations.... Deputy Fini, is the majority already 
beginning to fall apart? 
  [Fini] Not at all! The election campaign is still not 
over.... The situation will go back to normal after 12 June. As 
regards the committee chairmanships which the majority failed to 
obtain in the Senate, I do not believe they will be an obstacle 
to the government's action. 
  [Caprettini] However, there is already some talk of going 
back to the polls. 
  [Fini] No, I do not believe elections will be necessary. 
  [Caprettini] Not even if Bossi continues his offensive 
against Forza Italia? 
  [Fini] I repeat: For his election campaign, Bossi has chosen 
to clash with Berlusconi because he fears that his own identity 
may be watered down or swamped. This is why he is raising his 
voice. I do not justify his stand, but...let us say that I 
understand his political logic. After the vote, however, I 
think the problems will be solved. In fact, Bossi himself has 
said that this majority is not to be tampered with for at least 
another two years. 
  [Caprettini] However, can a negative result in the European 
elections not lead the League to exacerbate the differences? 
  [Fini] If Bossi were to lose a lot of ground...then 
something 
may indeed happen. On the other hand, I am asking myself: 
Where could he then go? 
  [Fini] Well, to the Left, I guess. His beckoning to the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left], his vaunted support for 
Arlacchi's candidacy for the chairmanship of the Anti-Mafia 
Commission.... 
  [Fini] Mmmm, no.... (Here Fini made a grimace, he did not 
believe that Bossi would start moving in a different direction 
-- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) I do not believe that he is 
seriously thinking of changing his position. 
  [Caprettini] Deputy Fini, what do you think of the fact that 
the other day, speaking to his deputies, Berlusconi praised you 
to the heavens? Do you wish to return his compliments? 
  [Fini] I must say that the prime minister was always very 
straightforward with me, and therefore I reciprocate his trust 
in me. Which does not mean, of course, that I have always 
agreed with him. 
  [Caprettini] Have you already had some differences of 
opinion? 
  [Fini] Over the intelligence services, for example. I would 
have already started from scratch. 
  [Caprettini] What about Forza Italia's idea of opening a 
dialogue with the PPI [Italian Popular Party] in the future, if 
[PPI leader] Buttiglione wins the day? 
  [Fini] I agree that the majority must become broader, and 
that it can show some interest in Buttiglione. We must, 
however, establish a premise, namely, that it should be them who 
approach the majority positions, rather than pretending that we 
are shifting toward them. 
  [Caprettini] Today you were interviewed by THE WASHINGTON 
POST, NEWSWEEK, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- the entire U.S. press 
is asking you whether you are a fascist, right? 
  [Fini] My God! I have done nothing but answer this very 
question. 
  [Caprettini] What did you say about Mussolini? 
  [Fini] Exactly what I had already told LA STAMPA, and which 
was in fact somewhat distorted, namely, that he was one of the 
greatest Italian politicians in this century. I confirm this. 
  [Caprettini] What did you think of [Rome Mayor] Rutelli's 
speech at the Capitol before the U.S. President -- in which he 
stressed that there would never again be a dictatorship in Italy? 
  [Fini] He said the same things that I had already said in my 
speech on trust, in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Caprettini] Finally, a word about Clinton. What is your 
opinion of him? 
  [Fini] He is a pragmatist, like all Americans.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Mirko Tremaglia, chairman of the </F>
Foreign Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, by 
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "Fascism is dead. It is a 50-year-old piece of 
history that is closed for ever. We do not call ourselves 
neofascists, and we are against all forms of totalitarian 
regime," said Mirko Tremaglia, who was elected chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Italian Chamber of Deputies 
last Wednesday [1 June]. His election gave rise to much 
negative comment in the international press, and Tremaglia has 
been branded a neofascist. 
  For 22 years he has been a popularly elected deputy for the 
MSI, the Italian Social Movement. The MSI has always been 
described as a neofascist party. Tremaglia has been a member 
since the party's foundation. His party chairman, Gianfranco 
Fini, does not talk about neofascism, but prefers the term 
"postfascism." "Whatever that might be," Tremaglia said, 
throwing his arms in the air. But "Mussolini belongs to 
history," he told AFTENPOSTEN. 
  In the elections in March the MSI was the senior partner in 
the National Alliance (AN), which in electoral cooperation with 
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the 
federalist Northern League under Umberto Bossi achieved a 
landslide victory. The neofascists found themselves in a 
position of power for the first time since the end of World War 
II. 
  Tremaglia believes that corruption broke the back of the 
Italian First Republic. Prime Minister Berlusconi's right-wing 
coalition will give society the renewal that is needed. The AN 
has its priorities clear: 
  "We are aiming at reforms in order to introduce a republic 
with presidential rule in which a section of parliament is 
reserved for political parties and another section is for 
citizens. In the days of the First Republic we had no 
representatives from that world," Tremaglia said. 
  When AFTENPOSTEN asked if this means that he is talking 
about 
the corporate state, he replied brusquely that "I have already 
said what the AN stands for." 
  [AFTENPOSTEN] How long will the coalition government stay 
together? Northern League leader Bossi did not even want to 
acknowledge people from your party during the election campaign. 
  [Tremaglia] Yes, but now he is no longer saying no. Things 
have changed. Now national interests have been given top 
priority. It is important to have reforms implemented; to 
create a republic with the involvement of those Italians who 
work and produce things -- that is, the forces which have been 
subordinate to the power of the politicians. This is something 
which we now have to turn on its head," Tremaglia said with 
Italian passion. 
  He also told AFTENPOSTEN about a meeting he had with 
industrialists immediately before coming to Norway last Friday. 
At the meeting there was a mood of support for the course he -- 
without wanting to use political labels -- is advocating. 
"People no longer want to give carte blanche to the 
politicians, but want to assume responsibility themselves and 
attend to things political. This is `the new Italy.' This is 
why Clinton is saying that people must give us a chance and 
support us. People must be judged on what they do, not on the 
basis of labels," Clinton has said. 
  "Since the MSI was founded in 1946 we have never had any 
intention of rebuilding the fascist regime there was before. 
Over the years the MSI has gained legitimacy through democratic 
channels, through free elections," Tremaglia said. 
  He has been in Oslo for a meeting of NATO's parliamentary 
assembly. He has been a member of this assembly since 1984, and 
has had regular contacts with Norwegian politicians. 
  He also told AFTENPOSTEN with pride that he met the king 
when 
he was in Norway in 1987. "I have met many people over the 
years and no one has objected to me. Now many people are 
crying: `You were in the war. Fascist.' I was 17 then," the 
67-year-old said resignedly. He believes that it is "the 
crisis-hit Italian left" -- among others -- which is trying to 
plant unfavorable allegations abroad about him and others from 
the AN. 
  "Some people have said that it is strange that a person with 
such a past can be elected chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee. What do people actually mean by this? I have never 
done anything criminal. We will be asking for explanations of 
such comments," said Tremaglia, who is happy that the chairman 
of the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee, Hakan Blankenborg, 
has said that he does not want to be involved in any witch hunt 
or any persecution of individuals. 
  He believes that the at times violent reactions from abroad 
to what is being called the neofascists' entry into the 
corridors of power are out of place. "We have been elected by 
the Italian people in democratic elections, and do not have a 
mandate from anyone else," he said. He is happy that Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino has made it clear both to French 
President Francois Mitterrand and to others that Italy will not 
have any interference or threats. 
  Tremaglia is not always as careful when he makes statements. 
Last month he said that the Treaty of Osimo which fixes Italy's 
borders with Yugoslavia should be torn up. Many took this to 
mean that he wants a revision of the borders in order to regain 
areas where people of Italian extraction live. 
  "We are not asking for any border changes. It would be 
anachronistic to make such demands," he said emphatically. But 
he also pointed to the Berlin Wall, the divided Germany, and to 
the fact that no one thought that reunification would come, 
given the situation. 
  [AFTENPOSTEN] What political "kin" do you feel your party 
has 
in Europe? 
  [Tremaglia] An important question for the future 
. "The AN has received an envoy from (Jacques) Chirac's party," 
he said. He was hinting that the AN now feels at home in the 
same pigeonhole as the French Gaullists. 
  Tremaglia simply laughed and shook his head when AFTENPOSTEN 
asked whether the AN does not feel some kinship with Le Pen and 
his racist French nationalists. 
  "The MSI has dissociated itself from the racist legislation 
from Benito Mussolini's days." 
  AFTENPOSTEN reminded him that party chairman Fini has spoken 
of Mussolini as the greatest statesman of our century. A 
well-prepared Tremaglia trotted out two quotes from Britain's 
wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill -- one from 1933 and 
one from 1943 -- to show what respect Mussolini enjoyed. It was 
clear from both quotes that Churchill believed that Mussolini 
effectively and laudably saw to it that the Socialists and the 
Bolsheviks were kept out of power. 
  The problems of the Mediterranean are also close to 
Tremaglia's heart. He fears a serious crisis in the wake of the 
"terrible immigration" from North Africa. That is why he is a 
strong advocate of a 30-year plan for European investment in 
North Africa, "instead of our taking in 20 million North 
Africans. It is not right that people should have to move away 
from their own countries to find work."

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi </F>
signed "g.p." in Padova; date not given: "Bossi: `Forza 
Italia? Dilettantes'" -- first paragraph is LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Padova -- For the moment, [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi is staying away from Rome. For some time he 
had been planning a tour of election rallies and, for him, 
rallies are all-important, and therefore he is not prepared to 
consider postponing them, neither for Clinton's sake nor for the 
sake of the differences within the majority. However, albeit 
from afar, Bossi is following developments step by step, 
suggesting the next moves to be made, and encouraging his men. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What is happening, Deputy Bossi? 
  [Bossi] What is happening is that we are confronted by a 
bunch of dilettantes who are in full rout. It reminds me of 
"Corrida," Corrado's TV program. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Who are the dilettantes? 
  [Bossi] The mistakes have been made by the people in Forza 
Italia. I had told them and warned them repeatedly. I even 
explained the situation in an interview. I then said: "Let us 
give them a few parliamentary oversight committees." 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Give the committees to whom 
  [Bossi] The opposition forces. Not only because of the 
democratic principles involved, but also because the majority 
does not have sufficient numbers in the Senate. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] So what happened instead? 
  [Bossi] They moved to the attack. You see, you cannot say 
"I won and I take everything" without having sufficient numbers. 
It is numbers that count in a democracy. You bet they do. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] However, some Forza Italia members are 
insisting on elections. 
  [Bossi] They say such things to conceal their utter lack of 
ability. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What about the defeat over the committees? 
  [Bossi] We must now see what happens. Of course, it is a 
clear and very telling indication of how hard things are likely 
to become in the house. We must negotiate with the opposition, 
but I think that it is a bit too late now. I have been saying 
so for weeks. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] In short, [Prime Minister] Berlusconi is 
failing to grasp the situation? 
  [Bossi] Berlusconi is in the hands of a bunch of amateurs. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Yes, but rumor has it that some of them are 
pressing for new elections, so as to reduce the League's 
strength. 
  [Bossi] Such people are going nowhere. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] You have put an end to your flirt with the 
Left, but the fact remains that, when he stood as a candidate 
for the chairmanship of the Public Works Committee, League 
member Bosco also received votes from the Left, and was elected 
thanks to these votes. 
  [Bossi] The Left proved to have a good eye. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] Why a good eye? 
  [Bossi] Because we have proved that we are the only genuine 
political force in this mess. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] What will happen with the anti-Mafia 
Committee? 
  [Bossi] That is a different story. The real problem was the 
permanent committees those used for governing. 
  [LA REPUBBLICA] But did you expect all this to happen? 
  [Bossi] When I read the first signs I was surprised and 
worried. I told myself "This is going to end in a big mess" -- 
and I was right.

<F P=106> [Article by Bianca Stancanelli in collaboration with Alberto </F>
Selvaggi: "Pinuccio Richelieu: The Moderate Tatarella"] 
  [Text] Deputy prime minister as well as cabinet 
member, he is the shrewd pioneer of the AN [National Alliance] 
concept. 
  His friends describe him as a Fox whose partner is the Cat, 
Gianfranco Fini. Even his enemy Giorgio Pisano, a certified 
fascist, acknowledges his diabolical shrewdness. "In the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] thay called him the Levantine. He is a 
Richelieu." They say his specialty is convincing someone to do 
his bidding while giving the poor soul the impression that he 
made the decision on his own. Who knows whether that is how he 
became part of the government team? 
  The fact remains that Giuseppe ("Pinuccio") Tatarella--59 
years of age; a native of Cerignola, Apulia; married, no 
children; a professional politician who presents himself as a 
lawyer; and an MSI soft-liner who founded the National 
Alliance--is today the number two in the Berlusconi cabinet. He 
is the deputy prime minister and minister of posts and 
telecommunications, a ministry that used to have little prestige 
but that now--in the cabinet of the King of TV--has been 
upgraded to the status of supplementary heart of the government. 
It is now one of the most sensitive and strategically decisive 
ministries and is charged with redesigning the new map of the 
airwaves and rewriting the Mammi Law. 
  He is the first postfascist to serve in the cabinet in the 
50 
years since the fall of Benito Mussolini. "Tatarella a fascist?" 
Pisano protests indignantly. "But he has never been one!" Too 
shrewd to forswear fascism, Pinuccio the Fox employs verbal 
acrobatics to avoid the trap. "If we do not end the war of words 
and judge the Right and the Left on the basis of results, we 
will not solve any problem." 
  A low profile is his favorite weapon. Unkempt in appearance, 
with his clothes perpetually stained because he has the bad 
habit of spilling coffee and pasta on himself, this Richelieu of 
Cerignola is a tresette [Italian card game] addict, a masterful 
player at party congresses, a tireless dealmaker in the halls of 
parliament, and invincible when it comes to conquering the 
compartments of power--both within the party and outside it. 
Rumor has it that Giorgio Almirante advised his heir apparent 
Fini: "Be careful never to go against Tatarella." The young man 
took his advice. Today, in the AN constellation, the rising 
stars--from Maurizio Gasparri to Ignazio La Russa--all come from 
the Tatarella stable. Moreover, Apulia is the region best 
represented on the AN cabinet team, with two ministers out of a 
total of five: Tatarella, and Adriana Poli Bortone of Lecce. 
  There, in the heel of Italy's boot, the Tatarellas are 
multiplying. Whereas Pinuccio, the oldest of four sons of an 
honest shoemaker, is the undisputed head of the party, his 
youngest brother Salvatore--the mayor of Cerignola--is headed 
for a seat in the European Parliament. Still another brother, 
Matteo, is editor of the QUOTIDIANO DI FOGGIA. Along with 
politics and tresette, the print media is another of the 
passions of the new posts and telecommunications minister. A 
newspaper addict, he reads the papers, clips articles, and keeps 
them in a monumental file. Sometimes he himself has written 
them. In his biography for NAVICELLA--the who's who of the 
members of parliament--he not only wrote that he had been editor 
of the weekly PUGLIA D'OGGI but added that for a period it had 
been a daily and recited the names of a number of published 
articles, notable among which was "Quando Moro non era Moro" 
("When Moro Wasn't Moro"). In the early 1990's he founded 
REPUBBLICA PRESIDENZIALE, a monthly in which he argued the case 
for an AN. Accordingly, in May of 1993, well before Fini was won 
over to the cause, Tantarella was proclaiming: "The National 
Alliance must be the alternative for all Italians who believe 
the sirens of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and of the 
Left, both old and new, are out of date and should not be 
heeded." 
  Moderatism has always been his obsession--and his 
fortune--ever since the schism of the moderates within the 
National Democratic Party at the end of the decade of the 1970's 
opened the road to parliament for him. Until that time Tatarella 
had operated on the local scene, as councilman in a number of 
municipalities from Bari to Polignano and as a member of the 
regional council. The strong man of the Apulia MSI was Ernesto 
De Marzio, group leader in the Chamber of Deputies, and 
Tatarella was his private secretary. But when De Marzio embarked 
on the National Democratic Party adventure--to the great delight 
of the DC--Tatarella declined to follow him, because, among 
other things, the schism was opposed by a monument of the Apulia 
MSI, Araldo di Crollalanza, who during the 20 years of the 
fascism had been minister of public works and a peace advocate 
within Mussolinian fascism and subsequently served as senator of 
the Republic. In 1979 De Marzio suffered political defeat, and 
Tatarella entered the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Fifteen years later, Tatarella is deputy prime minister. He 
is the object of much attention in Bari, at the Yacht Club that 
he frequents together with his wife Angela, a cultured and 
refined university instructor of legal philosophy. He is 
received with full honors at Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime 
minister]. He is cruelly satirized in CUORE and demolished by 
Chantal Dubois, the dean of parliamentary fashion. At 
Tatarella's debut as deputy prime minister, Dubois destroyed him 
with the comment: "Tatarella believes he is presentable with 
black shoe polish on his hair." In his native Cerignola, his 
brother Salvatore snickers: "Pinuccio doesn't act like a cabinet 
minister. You look at him and you say, Mamma mia!'" But you can 
bet that having taken power, Pinuccio the Fox will change his 
coat of fur.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Cesare Previti by Federico </F>
Guiglia; place and date not given: "Women And Volunteers in the 
New Army" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction] 
  [Text] Women and volunteers are coming into the Second 
Republic's Armed Forces. The government's bill on the new 
defense model is just seven articles long. [Defense] Minister 
Cesare Previti read in a single breath the text destined to 
reducing the draft substantially over time, giving birth to an 
army consisting solely of professionals. He then signed and 
commented with satisfaction: "This is a liberal reform. What 
we save will be reinvested in the interests of Italy's 
international role." But in this interview with IL GIORNALE, 
the first granted to a daily newspaper, in which he speaks about 
defense problems, Previti does not renounce discussing "pure" 
politics. For example, about Forza Italia, his own party. "No, 
I do not personally believe that it will become a new DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] as under the old system. The 
pivotal point of the majority, yes. No danger of recycling. 
The important thing is that Silvio [Berlusconi] continue his 
path undaunted. He must avoid compromises on two fundamental 
items: free trade and the majority principle, which means that 
the person in power should not make easy agreements with the 
opposition. 
  [Guiglia] Minister, why do you not completely abolish 
useless 
military service? 
  [Previti] The draft remains an essential factor of national 
cohesion and of morality, because it brings the people closer to 
and ties them indissolubly to the Armed Forces. The solution in 
the Italian case, also based on the work of my predecessors, is 
that of a mixed model. What we are looking for in the future is 
to have 60,000 to 75,000 long-term volunteers and 70,000 to 
85,000 draft soldiers. We are also expecting to reduce the 
overall number of soldiers from the present 335,000 to 250,000 
officers and noncommissioned officers included. 
  [Guiglia] The Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Which comes 
off worst? 
  [Previti] During the past three years the budget cuts have 
affected in particular the technological part of the Armed 
Forces. I would say that the Navy and the Air Force have been 
severely penalized. But, in any case, it would be a mistake to 
make a classification of past policy. Right now the important 
thing is to recoup part of the old budget cuts and to pay for 
the reform, in part also with the money which is saved. 
  [Guiglia] Are you for or against [former President] 
Cossiga's 
proposal to unify the Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security 
Service] and Sisde [Intelligence and Democratic Security 
Service]? 
  [Previti] I do not agree. Just last Tuesday [31 May] I 
visited SISMI's headquarters at Forte Braschi. I was impressed 
by the efficiency and the high technological preparedness of the 
people I met. Perhaps the fact that military people predominate 
at SISMI gives the feeling of greater organization and a very 
professional approach. Their tasks seemed to me to be very well 
defined. 
  [Guiglia] Regularly, someone calls for the demilitarization 
of the Carabinieri. Can you tell us in advance what your reply 
will be? 
  [Previti] Please. I am the first to want renewal, but not 
mental agitation, which is what the demilitarization of the 
Carabinieri would end up being. In the reform which the 
government is right now presenting to parliament there are more 
than a few genuine novelties. I am thinking of the introduction 
of voluntary service for women. But I am also thinking of the 
tens of thousands of people who turn around the so-called 
defense industry and who can set themselves in motion again to 
give birth to the new model of the Armed Forces, based more on 
quality than on quantity. We are also studying the possibility 
of involving schools in the museums which testify to Italian 
military history. And it would not be a bad thing to freshen up 
the 2 June [Festival of the Republic] or 4 November [Italian 
Armistice Day] celebrations. In short, the objective is to 
increasingly integrate civilian society and the military world. 
  [Guiglia] It is only in politics that "partnership" does not 
apply? 
  [Previti] To the Left as well, the logic is gaining strength 
of a healthy distinction between government and opposition. 
Cacciari, Salvi, and Napolitano [all Democratic Party of the 
Left] are already of this opinion. I would add that anyone who 
has had key positions in the First Republic, the partnership 
republic, should hand in his resignation. It is not for this 
reason that the "old hands" will be marginalized by the new 
majority. Beware of purges. But beware of not clarifying things. 
  [Guiglia] Also for the Senate presidency? 
  [Previti] Better to be defeated because one has failed to 
give birth to a majority than to win because of a hidden 
agreement with the opposition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Silvana </F>
Mazzocchi; place and date not given: "Biondi: It will Backfire 
on Mafia"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Mazzocchi] Minister, [former Mafia boss] 
Riina has issued a political message urging the government to 
change the law on people who turn state's evidence and attacking 
prison regulations for top criminals. What reassurances do you 
think you can provide? 
  [Biondi] This will backfire on Riina: The law on criminals 
that turn state's evidence will remain in force, and will in 
fact be stepped up; I guarantee it. The Italian people can feel 
confident: There will be no yielding on the government's part. 
  [Mazzocchi] Riina talked about a "communist conspiracy" and 
addressed the government with unprecedented boldness and 
disdain. And he did so in a court of law. How was that possible? 
  [Biondi] It is to be expected that a prisoner will complain 
about prison regulations and that a defendant will complain 
about those who accuse him. Just as it was to be expected that 
he would take advantage of this tense situation in Italian 
society to issue warnings and judgments. However, I regret that 
the very people who should have expected it did not do so. In 
prison Riina is subject to rule 41B, the toughest regulation. 
So the fact that a man who is guarded day and night can speak 
from a court of law, addressing the whole nation, if not a 
crime, is certainly an error. 
  [Mazzocchi] What measures has the government adopted? 
  [Biondi] I have ordered an inspection. I hope soon to have 
all the necessary information, and the Higher Magistrates 
Council will reach a verdict on what has happened. 
  [Mazzocchi] What is your answer to those who are urging you 
to make a statement? 
  [Biondi] I do not need to submit to any investigation either 
with regard to the steadfastness that I will be able to 
maintain, or with regard to the fact that I will not submit to 
Mafia intimidation. And merely to think that an institutional 
government could yield to Riina's threats is insulting and 
offensive. The struggle against the Mafia remains an absolute 
priority for this government, within observance of the law, of 
course. So I cannot fail to agree with [former chairman of the 
parliamentary Anti-Mafia Committee] Luciano Violante, when he 
argues that the struggle against organized crime must not 
separate the majority from the opposition. 
  [Mazzocchi] Let us return to Riina's demands. You promised 
changes to the law on people who turn state's evidence. Do you 
not think that now they would seem like a concession? 
  [Biondi] The fact that he demanded the abolition of the law 
certainly causes us some concern in this regard. But I will 
confine myself to examining what can be changed without being 
weakened. And there are no plans to eliminate or weaken the 
measures governing prison regulations as defined under Rule 41B 
or to alter the legislation on people who turn state's evidence. 
This, at least with regard to the ways in which evidence is 
gathered. However, as regards the relationship between the 
custody of someone who has turned state's evidence and his 
handling during the trial stage or the methods for establishing 
his reliability (not for the purposes of the trial, but for 
practical purposes) with a view to any rewards, I noted which 
points might be examined by a special committee formed by Conso. 
The law must be brought into line with the principles of the a 
constitutional state. We must be sure about what the person 
turning state's evidence says, so that we can submit his 
statements as decisive evidence in trials. 
  [Mazzocchi] What kind of changes are you talking about? 
  [Biondi] We must resolve certain problems concerning the 
management of people who turn state's evidence. Must the people 
who hold him in detention be the same as those who interview 
him? How is his reliability to be established? The solution of 
these and other problems does not weaken the struggle against 
the Mafia, but indeed strengthens it. I can therefore guarantee 
that the government will not take any steps that could weaken 
the effectiveness of the law governing criminals who turn 
state's evidence. And if Riina was hoping to address his 
warning to a weak and indulgent government, I really think he 
chose the wrong target. Because it will only backfire on him, as 
I said before. 
  [Mazzocchi] Are you promising greater severity? 
  [Biondi] No, he will not make me alter course; not at all. 
But since the public cannot fail to have been struck by what 
has happened, I can assure you that not only will there be no 
changes to guarantees of security (which is the responsibility 
of the interior minister) but also that the judicial judgment of 
criminals turning state's evidence will be carried out by the 
judiciary with the same instruments that they have used hitherto.

<F P=106> [Article by Tino Oldani: "Revenge of a Free Marketeer"] </F>
  [Text] A renowned technical expert--Dini "The 
American"--goes from the Bank of Italy to serve as director of 
the recovery. 
  Lamberto Dini as treasury minister: sweet revenge. The 
former 
general manager of the Bank of Italy should indeed be feeling 
great satisfaction these days. For 14 years--from 1979 to 
1993--with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the governor's chair, Dini 
never had any actual power--despite his nominal position as 
number two at the central bank--other than the ability to pursue 
his studies and present scholarly reports at conferences. For 14 
years Ciampi kept tight rein over all delegated powers, even 
over the operation of the motor pool. The final blow came one 
year ago, when the governor became prime minister and appointed 
Antonio Fazio as his successor, bypassing Dini within the 
internal hierarchy of the bank and thereby breaking with the 
traditional practice of promoting the general manager. 
  In short, the "ostracism" that the guru of leftist 
economists, Paolo Sylos Labini, boasts of having practiced 
against free marketeers for several decades at the universities 
is something that the 63-year-old Dini, a lifelong free 
marketeer, had experienced personally for almost 15 years at the 
Bank of Italy--until Wednesday 11 May, when he took the oath as 
treasury minister in the Berlusconi administration. 
  That morning, for the first time, all the newspapers treated 
Dini with great kindness, including those--such as LA 
REPUBBLICA--that had been attacking him for years. The foreign 
press--for which Dini represents not merely the only 
recognizable face among the economic ministers but also the most 
prestigious--were downright extravagant in their praise. The 
FINANCIAL TIMES defined him as "well known internationally," and 
the WALL STREET JOURNAL added that he is "well respected." In 
wishing him well, Henning Christophersen, vice president of the 
EU [European Union], cited Dini's talent as a "skillful 
negotiator." It is an encouraging send-off for a mission that is 
not an easy one: defending not only the lira but also--at the 
same time--the credibility of the new government's economic 
policy in the area of foreign relations. 
  It is no accident that Dini is better known and more highly 
regarded abroad than in Italy. When he was appointed general 
manager of the central bank in 1979 he was almost unknown in 
Rome, for until that time he had always worked in Washington 
with the IMF, of which he had become one of the central 
directors. He is a technical expert who was trained as a free 
marketeer and imbued with American economic culture, which 
consists of few constraints and much pragmatism. Even his 
hobbies were those of the average American: photography and 
American football (he was a big fan of the Washington Redskins, 
and even now, when in the United States, he goes to the stadium 
to watch them). When--in the aftermath of certain legal 
events--replacements were sought for Paolo Baffi and Mario 
Sarcinelli, the initial candidates were Ciampi for bank governor 
and Sergio Siglienti for general manager; Ciampi was supported 
by the then treasury minister Filippo Maria Pandolfi, and Dini 
by the left wing of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and by 
the then prime minister Francesco Cossiga. But Industry Minister 
Toni Bisaglia, the strong man of the Dorotea [rightist] faction 
of the DC, dug in his heels and vetoed Siglienti. Why? At the 
instigation of a young colleague, Vittorio Barattieri, Bisaglia 
had met Dini and was captivated by him, to the point that he 
judged him to be the right man for Via Nazionale [Bank of Italy 
headquarters]. In the end, Bisaglia got his way. 
  After Bisaglia left the scene, it was alleged that Dini had 
the protection of Giulio Andreotti initially and of Bettino 
Craxi later. The mere mention of this allegation, however, seems 
to annoy the new treasury minister. To be sure, Andreotti had 
made his acquaintance: it was in 1976, when as a director of the 
IMF Dini negotiated a standby [preceding word in English] loan 
of $500 million with the government in Rome, which was at the 
time headed by Andreotti. The loan was of vital importance for 
Italy, which had almost exhausted its currency reserves. Dini 
also worked closely with Craxi in 1985, at the G-7 summit in 
Tokyo at which time the Italian delegation, headed by the 
Socialist leader, requested and obtained the expansion of the 
political G-5, which until then had excluded Italy and Canada. 
The document in question was drafted by Dini himself, who 
discussed the most sensitive clauses with his close friend, U.S. 
Treasury Secretary James Baker. 
  Other than these instances of collaboration, however, it is 
hard to find any indications of a close political relationship 
between Dini and those who for years had been cited as his 
protectors. The fact is that for years Dini had been 
isolated--and not infrequently disparaged--until Berlusconi 
rediscovered him. Basically, the two men have more than one 
trait in common: they believe in a free-market economy, and 
throughout their respective careers they were subjected to 
harassment and opposition but emerged victorious. 
  The challenge that now awaits Dini is one of those 
impossible 
tasks: to put the government's accounts in order. The fear is 
that the Ciampi administration left behind a deficit larger than 
had been announced. For this reason, Dini's first move will be a 
careful reassessment of the true dimensions of the public debt. 
As for the future, there will be no more maneuvering. The idea 
of drafting the 1995 budget in advance is making headway with 
two objectives in mind: to stabilize the ratio between the 
public debt and the GDP, on the one hand, and to prevent--at any 
cost--the initial symptoms of recovery from rekindling inflation.

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Moltedo: "Clinton in the Fininvest Show"] </F>
  [Text] As he spoke to the press yesterday evening, standing 
on the small platform raised in Palazzo Chigi's [government 
seat] courtyard, [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi seemed 
almost as tall as Bill Clinton. Who knows if some indiscreet 
camera may not have revealed the platform intended to add a few 
inches to Fininvest's owner. A show business expert, a manic 
perfectionist when it comes to framing TV shots, Berlusconi 
tried to cash in as much as possible on Bill Clinton's 
visibility. And he succeeded by playing the game on the most 
favorable field to him, namely that of images and communication. 
Undoubtedly, the abundance of TV images of Clinton's Roman 
tour, with Berlusconi acting as ever-smiling host, has impressed 
the general public as a sort of blessing of the government on 
the part of the first -- and nowadays sole -- world power. 
  However, what is the truth behind glamorous TV images? By 
the very fact that it took place, Clinton's visit politically 
legitimizes the Fininvest government. This, however, is only 
true to a certain point, if we want to give an objective report 
on yesterday's events. The U.S. President's words did not sound 
like an unconditional approval. They included reservations and 
undertones of concern. On the other hand, the press conference 
itself gave a measure of the extent of the problem posed by the 
fascists' presence in the government. Many of the questions 
concerned this topic. Clinton was able to gauge, first hand, 
the seriousness of this issue, and he seemed to behave 
accordingly, within the limits imposed by circumstances. He 
seemed to be in some Latin American country or other, in which 
an exceedingly fragile democracy is at risk, and whose rulers 
must, in the first place, give assurances as to democracy and 
human rights (the latter were in fact mentioned), with the 
American leader of the moment listening and giving out marks, 
and reserving the prerogative to judge on the basis of facts. 
This is how Clinton behaved, and it amounts to an unspoken 
admission that a problem does indeed exist, and that it is not 
one which can be easily surmounted. 
  In his global, strategic outlook, Clinton may, cynically, 
deem it expedient to support a government like the present one 
in order -- among other reasons -- to win over an area of Europe 
-- whose remaining, and largest, part is moving further away 
from him every day -- rather than merely out of a noble and 
genuine antifascist feeling. However, he must also take very 
much into account public opinion at home -- a public opinion 
which continues to feel growing concern at the absurd escalation 
of Italian politics, including a whole series of facts (Nazis in 
Vicenza), threats (scraping the Osimo Treaty), and statements 
(gay people should be interned in concentration camps). 
Yesterday THE NEW YORK TIMES's editorial highlighted the 
"historical irony" involved in the fact that the President found 
himself commemorating Europe's liberation at the same time as 
fascist exponents were returning to government. 
  Is it only the past that is involved? Are today's fascists 
not the same as yesterday's? Berlusconi assures us they are 
not. However, a more skeptical THE NEW YORK TIMES warned 
Clinton: "The 50th anniversary of the offensive against fascist 
Europe is the occasion to commemorate the heroic crusade for 
freedom undertaken by America and her allies. But it is also an 
occasion for remembering the damage fascism inflicted on Europe 
in a not-too-remote past. When `postfascist' parties speak of 
scrapping treaties and sending people to concentration camps, 
they must be taken seriously and called to account."

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva today visited the 
National Defense Institute and delivered an interesting lecture 
to the graduates on the state of the economy, the European 
Union, and foreign policy. More details from Paulo Barbosa: 
  [Barbosa] [passage omitted] The prime minister spoke about 
foreign policy and Angola: 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We continue to follow closely 
the Lusaka peace talks and to support the UN envoy's efforts. 
These efforts are aimed at reaching an agreement that may allow 
the existence of a fair and long-lasting peace process in that 
tormented country. 
  The situation in Angola is truly tragic: A lot more people 
are dying in Angola than in the Bosnian conflict. Therefore, it 
is imperative that the international community does not abandon 
Angola, that it keeps showing an interest in the ongoing 
negotiations, and that it shows its readiness -- in case an 
agreement is reached -- to give the necessary assurances for its 
compliance, namely the availabilty on the ground of a UN peace 
force. 
  We have not yet signed a military cooperation agreement with 
Angola because of the situation of armed conflict that still 
coexists with the endless Lusaka peace negotiations. [end

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  PCP Views </H5>
  The Lisbon daily PUBLICO reported on 8 May that there are no 
prospects for an alliance between the PCP and the Socialist 
Party (PS) for the 1995 legislative elections. Luis Sa, member 
of the Communist Party (PCP) political commission and leader of 
the party's list for the European Parliament elections, stated 
at a meeting in Funchal that PS views are generally too close to 
those held by the governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). Only 
if the PS were to adopt new policies to differentiate itself 
from the government would the PCP consider a rapprochement. Sa 
added that joint lists had never been advocated for legislative 
elections but only for the Lisbon mayoral race, where the 
election of a leftist mayor depends on forming a a PS-PCP bloc. 
Responding to a question on eventual PCP support for Lisbon 
Mayor Jorge Sampaio in a presidential race, Sa said it is still 
"too early" to discuss the issue, which could only be considered 
after the PS reaches a decision on a particular candidate. 
<H5>  PS Views </H5>
  According to the 13 May issue of PUBLICO, PS officials also 
continue to affirm their party's "strategic autonomy" and reject 
an alliance with the PCP. The report speculates that the PS 
officials' statement may be related to recent poll results 
showing that an alliance with the PCP would boost the PS's 
percentages by only "1 or 2" percentage points.

  [Text] The Cyprus Government believes that, after the 
Butrus-Ghali report, the neutralization of the Turkish side's 
lack of political will is feasible if negotiations with the 
European Union [EU] for Cyprus' accession are immediately 
opened. In a statement to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation], Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that, 
once a decision is made to begin the negotiations, the Turkish 
side will find itself facing a dilemma. 
  Referring to the visit he will begin in Moscow tomorrow, Mr. 
Mikhailidhis described it as important, because it will take 
place immediately after the Butrus-Ghali report, which includes 
some of the suggestions submitted by the Russians. Responding 
to a question, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the time has come for 
Russian intervention in the process to promote a Cyprus 
solution. He also noted that Russia plays an important role and 
added that at his talks in Moscow they will examine the options 
proposed by the UN Secretary General in his report and will also 
discuss the Russian proposals toward promoting a Cyprus solution. 
  The foreign minister further said that the consultations, 
which the Secretary General proposes in his report on 
alternative ways to promote the Cyprus issue, should be based on 
the finding of the lack of political will on the Turkish side. 
  Referring to his meetings with the ambassadors of the five 
permanent members of the Security Council, Mr. Mikhailidhis said 
that some people continue to believe that there are 
possibilities in the confidence-building measures. Mr. 
Mikhailidhis added that he stressed to the ambassadors that it 
would be a tactical error to ignore the findings in the 
Butrus-Ghali report, which he described as a landmark.

  [Text] The Cyprus Government is working toward convening 
an international conference on the Cyprus issue. This statement 
was made by Foreign Minister at Larnaca Airport shortly before 
his departure this afternoon on an official visit to Moscow. He 
said that the Cyprus Government believes that convening an 
international conference is a very serious proposal, since the 
initiatives taken in the Cyprus issue thus far have failed. He 
added: For this reason, we must address the substance of the 
problem, which is nothing less than the presence of occupation 
troops and settlers in Cyprus. Mr. Mikhailidhis noted: If some 
countries agree or disagree, we will see this in the course of 
things. The foreign minister further said: In any case, we 
will work toward this. 
  The Cyprus issue will be the basic topic of Mr. 
Mikhailidhis' 
talks in Moscow and, as he noted, there will also be discussion 
of the Russian suggestions included in the options cited in the 
UN secretary general's report. He stressed that the Cyprus 
Government attaches great importance to his visit to Moscow for 
two important reasons: First, because of Russia's noteworthy 
active role on the international political scene and, second, 
because of its strong interest in Cyprus. He added: Russia's 
role will be very decisive in view of the consultations at the 
Security Council on the options to be adopted for the 
continuation of the peace process in Cyprus.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>
  [Text] The day before yesterday, Foreign Minister Alekos 
Mikhailidhis held a protest meeting with the ambassadors of the 
five UN Security Council permanent members. The meeting is 
considered to be the first step in a plan to promote the Cypriot 
Government's new policy. The policy is being formulated in view 
of the prospects and options included in UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. 
  According to reliable information I MAKHI has received, the 
meeting was considered necessary in order to prevent negative 
situations in the future, such as a possible return to the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] scheme. The Cypriot 
Government made it clear that it strongly opposes such an 
eventuality. 
  The meeting with the ambassadors was held immediately after 
the National Council meeting at which all the members of the 
body said they are intensely concerned with the (negative) U.S. 
intention to bring back the old set of ideas and CBM's (based on 
the Vienna talks and the U.S. promises). They especially 
stressed the dangers of this move in view of the expected UN 
Security Council resolution. The United States plays an 
important role in the resolution. 
  According to the same information, Mikhailidhis warned the 
ambassadors, who represent permanent members of the Security 
Council, that if there is no tangible evidence that the Turkish 
side has shown signs of goodwill, the Greek side will not 
participate in any dialogue. The foreign minister also referred 
to two points of the UN secretary general's report: 
  1) Butrus-Ghali's note that the lack of an agreement on the 
Cyprus issue is due to the "lack of political will both by the 
Turkish Cypriot leadership and the region outside of Cyprus 
(Turkey)." 
  2) The UN secretary general's position that no discussion on 
the CBM's (even if the 21 March document is modified) or the 
substance of the Cyprus issue will bear fruit if the lack of 
goodwill by the Turkish side is not rectified. 
  Mikhailidhis stressed to the "five" that any pressure on the 
Greek Cypriot side to accept any discussion will be fruitless, 
because this is a unanimous decision of the country's political 
leadership. 
  Answering a relevant question after the conclusion of the 
National Council meeting, President Glavkos Kliridhis said: 
"Some countries may believe that despite what the UN secretary 
general says, resuming the procedure might bear fruit. But, 
both sides must agree on this, because there can be no 
negotiations with just one side. Therefore, it will depend on 
us whether the talks will continue or not." 
  According to other information I MAKHI received, the second 
step in implementing the new policy will be taken up today at 
the foreign minister's meeting with his Russian counterpart, 
Andrey Kozyrev, in Moscow. 
  Meanwhile, the Turks are trying to stop the Greece-Cyprus 
efforts to promote Cyprus' application for membership in the 
European Union [EU] and will launch an official campaign in 
European capitals on 15 June. [Akyon] Dogan, Turkish minister 
in the Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of the 
campaign and will try to avert an EU decision on Cyprus' 
application at the Corfu summit. 
  Serge Abou, the EU observer to the Cyprus issue, will submit 
a report to the EU Council of Ministers on 13 June on 
developments in Cyprus. The Cyprus issue is expected to be 
discussed at the EU summit.

  [Text] Answering questions about his opinion on the latest 
UN secretary general's report, Archbishop Khrisostomos said: "We 
are not at all satisfied with UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report. The attribution of some vague 
responsibility to the Turkish side is ruined by the alternative 
procedures that are suggested." 
  Among other things, the archbishop said in his statement: 
"Who is Butrus-Ghali to threaten with his reference to the 
withdrawal of the UN international peacekeeping force that is 
stationed in Cyprus? Certainly not the Turkish side..... It is 
a threat to us, who will essentially remain exposed to the mercy 
of the fully armed Turkish troops and settlers." 
  "...the UN secretary general's report makes no reference to 
the need to put an end to the invasion and occupation or that 
the Turkish troops and settlers must withdraw. It also makes no 
reference to the basic UN resolutions." 
  The Archbishop suggests that: 

  -  The political leadership 
make united demands that the national issue return to its 
basis--that is, the invasion, occupation, and violation of human 
rights. We are all obliged to appeal to the United Nations, 
without hesitation or disagreement, and insist firmly that the 
basic UN resolutions be implemented. 
  -  We appeal to the powers 
guaranteeing Cyprus' independence--Great Britain and Greece--and 
demand that they fulfill their responsibilities and commitments 
stemming from the treaty that guarantees Cyprus' independence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Blame Squarely Placed"] </F>
  [Text] UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report to 
the Security Council, made public yesterday after a long wait, 
was welcomed by the Cyprus Government which, realistically, 
could not have wished for anything more. Butrus-Ghali 
unequivocally laid the blame for the deadlock in the latest 
round of negotiations on the Turkish Cypriot side which, he 
said, did not have the political will to reach an agreement on 
the implementation of the confidence-building measures. 
  He went even further, submitting five options to the 
Security 
Council on how to proceed after the latest failure. One is to 
withdraw UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] from the island, which 
would, in effect, be a reward for Rauf Denktas intransigence, as 
it is the Greek Cypriot side that wants the peacekeeping force 
to remain in Cyprus. He also suggested the possibility of using 
"coercive" measures against the side which did not cooperate. 
Another option would be to allow time for reflection by the 
Security Council and the guarantor powers, not ruling out the 
calling of an international conference. The two remaining 
options are more familiar: a return to the set of ideas and the 
map, or another attempt to implement the measures, even though 
he admitted that the last option would fail. 
  President Glavkos Kliridhis got exactly what he had been 
demanding in the report--the side responsible for the deadlock 
was blamed and the secretary-general suggested alternative 
courses of action. Now, whether the Security Council would 
adopt the suggestion for "coercive" measures is far from 
certain. What is certain, and in no way subject to 
interpretation, is Butrus-Ghali's assertion that the Turkish 
Cypriot side is lacking the political will for any agreement to 
be reached. He also exposed Denktas's favorite argument in 
rejecting UN proposals, about the Turkish Cypriots' security 
concerns--he did not see how this security could in any way be 
threatened by the implementation of the measures. In addition 
to this, he was emphatic (including documents to prove his 
point) in denying Denktas's claim that there had been changes to 
the original UN package. 
  But things must be kept in perspective. Kliridhis, unlike 
his predecessor, is not the type of politician to present the 
report as some major triumph, even though he deserves credit for 
his skillful handling. He ignored the criticism from all 
directions, calculating that Denktas's lack of political will 
would be exposed if he played his cards right, which he did. No 
one can say of course that a Cyprus settlement, as envisaged by 
the Greek Cypriots, is any closer now; nor can anyone forecast 
what line the Security Council would take when it discusses the 
report. 
  However the report could prove quite useful to the 
government 
next January when the European Commission will take a decision 
on Cyprus' application for membership of the European Union.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with the Cyprus 
Broadcasting Corporation, British High Commissioner David Madden 
said the British bases in Cyprus are a force of stability in the 
island and offer military advantages to Britain and significant 
financial benefits to Cyprus. Madden described the bases as a 
significant military capital for his country and the West, 
adding that the operation of the bases contributes 100 million 
pounds to the Cypriot economy. Commenting on an observation that 
the bases did not offer safety to Cyprus during the Turkish 
invasion in 1974, Madden said that 1974 is history. 
  The British high commissioner reiterated his country's 
position that, based on the 1960 agreements, Britain owes 
nothing to Cyprus for the operation of the bases. Asked about 
the British imports of goods from the occupied areas, Madden 
said this trade is neither a political action nor does it 
constitute a recognition of the occupied areas. He said: This 
stance is in line with Article 5 of the agreement linking Cyprus 
with the European Union. He added that his country expressed 
its views at the European Court, which is expected to make a 
decision. Madden said: Through trade, Britain is trying to 
achieve an intercommunal balance.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasos Vasiliou] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. services, police, and the Popular Bank 
went on alert a few days ago after the visit of a Russian 
businessman to the bank in order to deposit an amount well over 
$100,000 in cash. 
  According to our information, due to the fact that the 
dollars were almost new, the employees of the Popular Bank were 
afraid that they were counterfeit. 
  Police experts were called immediately, and they examined 
the 
approximately $140,000 with a machine of the latest technology. 
The examination showed that the dollar notes were legitimate. 
  At the same time, a U.S. expert was also called in; and 
after 
he examined the bills, he issued a finding which, we are 
informed, left the experts and others speechless. 
  Specifically, the U.S. expert confirmed beyond any doubt 
that 
all the dollars were part of aid money given by the United 
States to Russia. 
  According to our information, in addition to that, the U.S. 
expert knew the date the dollar notes were sent and received by 
the Russian Government. 
  However what left everyone speechless was the moment it 
became evident that the Americans knew not only when they had 
sent these specific dollars and when the money reached Moscow, 
but also their serial numbers. 
  Following that, the dollars were deposited because the main 
purpose of the investigation was to determine the authenticity 
of the dollars.

  [Text] The number of AIDS cases has shown a significant 
increase this year. The number of Cypriots who are new carriers 
of the AIDS virus increased to 13 during the first five months 
of 1994, compared to three cases during the same period last 
year. Four new cases of carriers of the AIDS virus were 
discovered last month: three men and one woman. In all cases, 
the infection was spread through sexual contact.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus, has proposed to Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos 
Kliridhis the signing of a mutual nonaggression pact, adding 
that the island can be demilitarized within an atmosphere of 
trust to be created by such a pact. 
  Denktas headed today's Council of Ministers meeting in which 
the recent developments on the Cyprus issue and various domestic 
issues were assessed. In a statement [issued] prior to the 
cabinet meeting, Denktas said that the Cyprus question can be 
solved only by Turkish and Greek Cypriots and called on the 
Greek Cypriot side to abandon the arms race. He said: Let us 
sign a nonaggression pact. Let us move toward disarmament 
within an atmosphere of trust to be created by such a pact, on 
condition that we preserve the guarantee agreement. Let us 
create a new atmosphere. Recalling that the Cyprus Republic was 
a partnership republic established by the Turkish and Greek 
Cypriots, Denktas said: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] For the past 30 years, we have 
been unable to form a government in Cyprus that represents the 
entire community on the island just because one of the sides 
claims to be the Cyprus Government, and because the Security 
Council has accepted this claim to suit the interests of certain 
Council member countries. This is the problem. The problem is 
that, for the past 30 years, the Greek Cypriot side, through the 
use of arms, has been occupying the position that is said to 
represent Cyprus. The problem is that the Greek Cypriot side 
believes it can continue this occupation and is obstinate about 
it. As long as this obstinacy continues, and as long as the two 
communities on the island do not find the opportunity to get 
together to discuss and solve their problems, this problem 
cannot be solved. We have seen that for the past 30 years, the 
Security Council and the United Nations have been unable to 
solve this problem. The sole reason for this failure is 
recognition of the Greek Cypriot Administration as the 
legitimate Cyprus Government. There is no other reason 
whatsoever. [end recording] 
  Denktas stated that the current negotiating process is a 
waste of time and called on the sides involved in the Cyprus 
conflict to make a new assessment and reach an agreement.

  [Text] Lefkosa [Nicosia], June 3 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Deputy Undersecretary Tugay Ulucevik, on Friday [3 June] said 
that the Cyprus problem cannot be solved by forceful means or 
pressure methods. 
  "Turkey is determined to prevent any kind of pressure 
directed against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," he 
said. 
  Ulucevik on Friday concluded his talks on the island and 
left 
for Turkey. 
  Speaking to reporters before his departure at Ercan [Tymbou] 
Airport, he said that the Turkish side has shown necessary 
goodwill and sacrifice during the talks process for the 
UN-proposed confidence building measures package. 
  He also criticized the UN secretary general's report which 
he 
added does not take into consideration the constructive attitude 
of the Turkish side.

  [Text] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has sent a letter 
to President Konstandinos Karamanlis. Government Spokesman 
Evangelos Venizelos confirmed that the letter has been sent, but 
he is not yet aware of its contents. 
  The letter reportedly refers to issues of the Workers Party 
of Kurdistan. Referring to Turkish claims that Kurdish 
guerrillas are being trained in Greece, the spokesman explicitly 
reiterated that such claims are slanderous and unfounded. He 
added that the Greek position is well-known, and mentioned the 
case of the Kurd who was arrested in Turkey and, after being 
tortured, supposedly confessed about the training of Kurds in 
Greece.

  [Text] Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. presidential envoy on the 
issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], arrived in Athens a short while ago for talks 
with the Greek Government. He will meet Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias at 1930 today. 
  Nimetz said he is not bringing any specific new proposals on 
the issue of Skopje, but he appeared optimistic about the 
mediation to smooth Greek-Skopjean relations. He left open the 
possibility of meeting Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, adding 
that such a meeting would depend on his talks with the foreign 
minister this afternoon. 
  In a major article yesterday, THE WASHINGTON POST predicted 
a 
Greek-Skopjean compromise, stressing that Skopje had wrongly 
exceeded beyond its authority in adopting historical and 
nationalistic symbols. The article says that with its relaxed 
diplomacy, the United States allowed the fire to spread, thus 
forcing Athens to harden its stance in the dispute with Skopje. 
According to the report, Washington's role is considered 
strained due to the stationing of 600 peacekeepers in Skopje, 
who could be the cause of confrontations throughout the Balkans.

  [Text] Upon his 1430 return at Ellinikon Airport today, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias expressed his satisfaction 
with his visit to Moscow. The foreign minister talked about 
full exchange of views with the Russian side on the Yugoslav 
issue, and pointed out that the two countries continue to 
support free navigation in the Canakkale Straits, as provided by 
the Montreux Treaty. 
  Responding to a question on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, Mr. Papoulias said he does 
not expect much from the visit by President Clinton's special 
envoy Matthew Nimetz, and made the assessment that Mr. Nimetz 
will not bring anything new to the current phase.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali called on 
special envoy Cyrus Vance to move as quickly as possible to a 
new round of negotiations with Athens and Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. ATHENS NEWS AGENCY 
reports from UN Headquarters in New York that Butrus-Ghali's 
request to Vance is included in a two-page report the UN 
secretary general submitted to the Security Council. In his 
report, Butrus-Ghali underlines that Vance's mediating mission 
is not affected by the European Court case of the Greek 
countermeasures against Skopje. The UN secretary general notes 
that he will submit a new report to the Security Council after 
the 13 June meetings in New York between Vance and the 
representatives of Greece and Skopje. 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described 
Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council on the issue of 
Skopje as brief, typical, and descriptive. Venizelos said he 
considers the secretary general's note that there is a need to 
continue the Vance initiative for solution of the issue as 
important.

Samaras once again asked the Greek Government to bring the issue 
of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to 
the European Union [EU] Summit in Corfu. At the same time, he 
called on the government to capitalize on the Greek presidency 
and to deal with the problems faced by farmers and the amendment

  Samaras was also asked about reports of U.S. Envoy Matthew 
Nimetz's proposal for a double name for Skopje. He said: 
"There should be an immediate and categorical rejection by the

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by </F>
correspondents Kiki Angelopoulou, Roula Kambouryianni, and an 
unidentified correspondent at the prime minister's office in 
Athens; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Will there be 
any progress at the Corfu Summit for the European Union [EU] 
membership applications from Cyprus and Malta? 
  [Papandreou] Look, this is our national position. These are 
two countries that must surely join the EU. We want to settle 
the issue of beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession, 
something that will certainly be raised in Corfu. 
  [Correspondent] What are the prospects and the climate? 
  [Papandreou] The climate is not very positive, because 
accession is linked to the solution of the political problem in 
Cyprus -- that is, to speak bluntly, with the occupation of 
northern Cyprus by Turkish troops. This is presented as an 
obstacle to Cyprus' accession. Turkey is utilizing it, and even 
threatening that if something like this happens then northern 
Cyprus will merge with Turkey. 
  [Correspondent] Would you comment on UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on the Cyprus issue? What are the 
current prospects for our national issue? 
  [Papandreou] I can honestly say that this is the first time 
I 
have been happy with a statement by the UN secretary general. He 
actually lays the blame where it belongs, on Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas and Turkey. It is the first time that 
something like this has been stated so clearly. This means we 
are at a turning point. Right now we are in a deadlock, and we 
must wait to see what the next step will be. 
  [Correspondent] It appears that there is a second report by 
the UN secretary general on the issue of Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Is the Greek Government 
officially aware of it? 
  [Papandreou] I know about the basic points of Butrus-Ghali's 
report. I have not seen the text. What is important is that 
the tripartite dialogue continue, in the sense that there are 
two bilateral talks -- with international mediator Cyrus Vance 
and U.S. presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz -- not direct talks 
with Skopje. I hope and pray that we will have some sort of a 
solution before long. 
  [Correspondent] Nimetz is expected in Athens next week, amid 
rumors about a double or triple name. 
  [Papandreou] Various scenarios. 
  [Correspondent] Right. Do you believe that the road to a 
permanent settlement of this national issue will be open after 
the European Parliament elections, or will we have to wait for 
the Skopjean elections in November? 
  [Papandreou] I have hopes that the issue will be concluded. 
About the scenario where there would be two names, I want to 
remind you that we have two basic positions: First, that we 
will not recognize any state if it includes the term Macedonia 
or any of its derivatives in its name; second, that we will lift 
the embargo the minute Skopje removes the star of Veryina from 
its flag and changes the articles of its Constitution that 
affect our country's territorial integrity. These are our two 
conditions and we will not deviate from them. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, Hellenism feels that it 
is being attacked from everywhere. There are sources of tension 
and provocations from Albania, Skopje, and Turkey. Do you 
believe that these are isolated incidents unlinked to one 
another? What is your evaluation? 
  [Papandreou] I cannot speak about an organized plan by these 
three. I cannot say that Turkey, Albania, and Skopje 
systematically cause problems for our country according to a 
plan. They do create problems though; and they have a climate 
of cooperation and mutual understanding, and there is a 
possibility that something like this will happen. What is 
happening in Albania may be explained better within the 
framework of Ankara's policy. I do not rule it out. I must say 
that before the wall of the Cold War fell, we did not have such 
problems. We are one of the few European countries that the 
fall of that wall treated unjustly. We are the only ones who 
did not benefit. 
  Our position on Albania is known. We follow an open door 
policy. We want peace, but on condition that Greek Albanians 
have all the rights that citizens enjoy anywhere else in the 
world today: human rights, the freedoms of religion, education, 
language, and culture. Albanian President Sali Berisha is 
clearly provoking Greece, a power that is much stronger than 
Albania. We have said that we are observing the situation. We 
have both diplomatic and political means that could make any 
decision of ours be felt heavily in Albania. Let us hope that 
things will cool off. It appears that for the time being they 
are. 
  [Correspondent] There is a climate of fabricated tension, 
particularly on Turkey's part. For example, Turkey is accusing 
us of training Kurdish guerrillas. There is some information 
that the United States is pressing for the Greek-Turkish 
dialogue to resume. What should our country's position toward 
Ankara be? 
  [Papandreou] First of all, I must stress that a big issue 
for 
Greece is relations with Turkey. Skopje is also important, but 
it is another type of issue. Skopje does not threaten us 
militarily. The same is true for Albania. Turkey is a great 
military power, so we must be careful. 
  What does starting a dialogue with Turkey mean? If this 
dialogue focuses on cooperation on some points--positive 
actions--then we must examine it. There are possibilities. 
However, when Turkey speaks about a dialogue, it means a 
dialogue that would resolve the so-called Greek-Turkish 
differences, in the Aegean for example. Let us not speak about 
Cyprus, which is a tremendous issue. What the Turks refer to as 
differences that must be resolved through a dialogue are things 
against our national sovereignty. So, when someone says that we 
must talk, I tell him to write down the issues. If the issues 
concern Turkish ambitions, why should I sit down and discuss 
them? If someone comes and tells you that your property is his, 
would you sit down to discuss with him whether it is his or how 
much of it is his? This is the Aegean problem. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Dh. P. Dhimas from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Speaking to ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Stephen Oxman, assistant 
secretary of state for European affairs, tried to play down the 
impression created last week from the statement made by U.S. 
State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry that Greek 
accusations for "systematic" pursuits against the Greek minority 
by the Albanian Government are "unfounded." 
  According to Oxman, McCurry's statement, which led to two 
successive demarches to the State Department, was 
misinterpreted. He said: "The remarks were taken out of 
context." [previous seven words published in English] 
  Actually, the more conclusive State Department statement 
notes: "Although it does not seem that the Albanian Government's 
policy is to suppress the Greek minority," concerns are being 
expressed about the situation that prevails on educational 
issues and other isolated incidents. 
  Oxman, however, believes the state of human rights in 
Albania 
is an issue "that must be examined very seriously." As he told 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, the U.S. Government "is in contact with the 
Albanian Government about the issues that Greece has raised." 
He said: "These issues must be examined seriously." It must 
be noted that according to Oxman, international human rights 
organizations made the evaluation that "they do not see any 
systematic violations" of the Greek minority's rights, thus 
indirectly justifying the U.S. position on this specific point. 
  Oxman referred to two basic problems of the Greek minority, 
"the teaching of the Greek language outside the minority zones 
and the return of the church's property." Commenting on these 
issues, the U.S. official said Washington has taken relevant 
steps, conveying the Greek concerns to the Albanian authorities. 
  The U.S. official said he "hopes" the two countries will 
overcome their bilateral problems and continue their "course," 
which was "cut off after the 10 April incident" with the murder 
of Albanian soldiers and the arrest of Greek Albanians, to 
improve their relations. 
  Obviously, the United States is aware of the violations of 
the Greek minority's human rights, but based on the evidence 
available does not consider them as "systematic and the basis of 
an official policy." According to reports, the United States 
has asked the Greek side, other factors, and organizations, for 
additional information to reinforce the Greek claims.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described 
as positive the statement by Stephen Oxman, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for European affairs, that human rights in 
Albania are somewhat violated lately. Venizelos justified his 
description of Oxman's statement by saying that the latest 
statement improves on the one by State Department Spokesman 
Michael McCurry. McCurry had said the United States has no 
evidence regarding the violation of human rights in Albania. 
Replying to a question, Venizelos said the Greek Government 
believes there is a climate of tension and insecurity which 
insults the human rights of the Greeks of Albania.

  [Text] Replying to an Albanian Foreign Ministry statement 
made yesterday accusing Greece of blocking European Union [EU] 
aid, thus punishing Albania and the Greek minority, Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas said Greece is following 
an open-door policy toward Albania. He said the Greek 
Government wants good relations with Albania, adding that it 
respects Albania's territorial integrity. He stressed, however, 
that the cornerstone of good bilateral relations is respect for 
the human and minority rights. 
  Referring to Albanian-EU relations, the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said Greece is obliged to tell Albania that its 
relations with the EU depend on respect for human rights. Bikas 
recalled that 350,000 Albanians live and work in Greece, thus 
strengthening the Albanian economy with $300 million a year.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dh. M.] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on a statement by Albanian President Sali 
Berisha that his country's openness to dialogue is a message of 
goodwill, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said he hopes 
Greek-Albanian relations will cool off. 
  However, the Greek Government continues to expect a lot from 
the U.S. stance and the pressure that it is in a position to 
exert on Tirana. In a letter to his U.S. counterpart Warren 
Christopher, the Greek foreign minister asks that the United 
States intervene immediately to create the conditions that will 
allow Greece and Albania to come to the negotiating table. In 
his letter, the Greek minister notes that the Albanian economy 
essentially depends on remittances by the 400,000 Albanian 
citizens who live and work, legally or illegally, in Greece. 
Papoulias asks the U.S. secretary to remind the Albanian 
Government of this fact and suggest to it that it move away from 
issues that create tension between the two countries, so that 
the way can be opened for a new approach. 
  At the same time, the Greek Government is trying to involve 
the European Union [EU] in the issue of Greek-Albanian 
relations. Of course, this will happen if the EU supports the 
Greek positions on the violation of the Greek minority's human 
rights. The Greek minister said: "In any case, the government 
is determined to take drastic measures to deal with the 
situation." 
  The Greek Government is in a hurry to ease the tension in 
Greek-Albanian relations, and not just because of the dangers to 
peace in the entire region. According to safe information, the 
Greek Government is concerned about the outcome of a possible 
trial for the six arrested members of the minority group 
Omonoia. According to the same information, the Greek 
Government is concerned about the possibility that the Albanian 
charges against some of the six will be proved either with 
existing or fabricated evidence. Indicative of the Greek 
Government's "embarrassment" is government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos' answer when asked if it is possible for a 
Greek-Albanian dialogue to begin when Albania insists on trying 
the six. Venizelos gave an ambiguous answer: "The Greek 
positions on protection of human rights and the rights of the 
Greek Albanians have been given." 
  The spokesman's answer reflects the Greek Government's 
dilemma, whether or not to pursue a political settlement of this 
issue. The views on this are split but many believe that the 
issue must close as soon as possible through political moves. 
Some diplomatic and government officials agree that if there is 
no trial, the Greek side will have to face the Albanian charges 
for the activity of some Omonoia members and the international 
community's suspicion. According to the second view, which is 
gaining ground, the Greek Government will lower its tones and 
let the initiative move to the Albanian Government. If Tirana 
proceeds with a trial, then Athens will condemn the procedure as 
a fabrication.... [ellipsis as published]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Takis Dhiamandis from Tirana] </F>
  [Text] Greek-Albanian relations, which appear to be hanging 
by a thread as the Albanian leadership still follows a policy of 
continuously stirring up tension that already exists between the 
two countries, are being led to boundary points. 
  According to evaluations from Tirana, some U.S. 
organizations 
are possibly behind this tension. A simultaneous action from 
Turkey, which if not a part of this crisis is surely exploiting 
it, is not ruled out. 
  Some observers go even further by saying that the explosion 
that has been expected in Kosovo or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] may happen at the Greek-Albanian 
borders. The Albanian leadership has every reason to pursue 
this alternative out of its political deadlock. 
  Apart from the domestic situation, which goes from bad to 
worse, the leadership of the Democratic Party and Albanian 
President Sali Berisha have failed in their foreign policy. 
Specifically, the situation in Kosovo appears to be easing up 
as the leader of the Albanian minority, Ibrahim Rougova, seems 
to accept the solution of autonomy. In Skopje, the smart moves 
of Gligorov's government have temporarily minimized the dangers 
of a clash in the region. 
  So, the only region that is open for President Berisha is 
Greece, in which he says--in an arbitrary addition of Arvanites, 
Tsamidhes, and illegal Albanian immigrants--there are 3 million 
Albanians.

  [Text] Athens, June 3, IRNA -- Iranian and European Union 
(EU) officials Friday [3 June] concluded a three-hour meeting in 
Athens described by both sides as "good and fruitful." 
  It was the first high-ranking talks between the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the 12-member European bloc during the 
current Greek EU presidency. 
  The EU was represented by its troika which consists of the 
former, the current and the next holder of the rotating 
six-month EU presidency -- Belgium, Greece and Germany 
respectively. 
  An official from the European Commission also participated 
in 
the long meeting. 
  "Talks were good, frank and useful," one EU diplomat, who 
participated in the meeting, told IRNA. 
  "Talks went very well and we discussed all issues linked 
with 
Iran's ties with the EU," said another EU diplomat to IRNA. 
  One Iranian diplomat described the talks as "good and 
fruitful," but both sides made no statements to the press. 
  The Iranian delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister 
for 
Euro-American Affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi, while Greek Foreign 
Undersecretary George Papandreou headed the EU-troika. George 
is the son of Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou. 
  Earlier Va'ezi accompanied by the director general of the 
West Euroepan desk at Iran's Foreign Ministry 'Ali Ahani and 
Iran's Ambassador to Greece Qasem Moheb-'Ali met George 
Papandreou and discussed Greek-Iranian ties and international 
issues. 
  "We want our traditional friendly ties to develop more and 
more. I had the opportunity to exchange a lot of bilateral views 
on our cooperation," Papandreou told IRNA. 
  The Iranian deputy foreign minister last night met Greek 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who is also the current 
president of the European Union (EU), and conveyed to him a 
message from President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, an Iranian 
diplomatic source told IRNA. 
  The source could not disclose the content of the message but 
it is thought to be linked with Iran-EU relations. 
  Va'ezi briefed the Greek leader on the situation in the 
Persian Gulf region and underlined the strong Greek-Iranian ties 
in all levels, during the 30-minute meeting at the prime 
minister's office. 
  He also extended an invitation to Papandreou to visit 
Tehran. 
  The Greek premier thanked Va'ezi for President Rafsanjani's 
message and accepted the invitaiton to visit the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the source told IRNA. 
  Papandreou assured Greece's help to promote EU-Iran ties and 
his Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will discuss all the 
phases of Greek-Iranian relations during his forthcoming visit 
to Tehran. 
  Greek and Iranian diplomatic sources told IRNA that 
Papoulias 
is expected to fly to Tehran Tuesday. 
  Va'ezi arrived in Athens Wednesday night for a 2-day visit 
for talks with Greek and EU officials on Iran-EU relations.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  U.S. Position Viewed </H5>
  Writing in the 15 May Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, New York correspondent D.P. Dhimas noted that 
the New York talks on the "Skopje" [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM] issue are at a "decisive turning point" 
because of Washington's "new ideas," promoted through UN 
procedures. Nevertheless, Dhimas wrote, the United States 
seemingly wishes to maintain a certain distance, preferring to 
leave the initiative to the United Nations to avoid being made a 
"scapegoat" for the "probable" failure, resulting from an 
"essentially sterile anti-Americanism," of any attempted U.S. 
mediating effort. Washington's reluctance to become deeply 
involved may be justified by the fact that the Greek defense and 
foreign affairs ministries "are not speaking the same language 
and are sending antithetical messages to Washington." On the 
one hand, U.S. officials are reportedly noticing an "updated 
perception of the situation" in Greek foreign policy resulting 
from the "freeing of its fixation on Skopje" and from the 
expansion of political and economic cooperation between Athens 
and Washington in the wider Balkans area, as expressed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yiorgos Papandreou, Dhimas continued. These 
attempts, however, are seen by Dhimas as being undercut by 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who, influenced by his 
immediate entourage, believes that his deputy minister's moves 
are "too accommodating" toward the United States. According to 
Dhimas, the "forked tongue" is apparent with regard to the 
establishment of a NATO headquarters in Larisa. While in 
December 1993 Washington received a message from Defense 
Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, conveying his agreement to open 
talks on this subject, in January 1994 Deputy Defense Minister 
Nikos Kouris demanded that the NATO headquarters issue be 
removed from the agenda of the meeting on defense cooperation 
between the Greek Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of 
Defense. According to Dhimas, the incident "upset" the U.S. 
side, which has since evidenced a degree of "indifference" and 
"incredulity" regarding Athens' wish for an increased Greek role 
in the Balkans, Dhimas concluded. 
<H5>  Pangalos' Statement </H5>
  The 13 May Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA cited Alternate 
Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos as saying during a radio 
interview that the "Skopje" problem must be settled "at all 
costs," and that it will be difficult to avoid the term 
"Macedonia" in any name. Pangalos was further cited as repeating 
his previous assertion that the Skopje issue was a "lost cause" 
and that Skopje insists on "Macedonia," because this was its 
name from 1950 to 1990 in the former Yugoslavia that Greece had 
recognized, because "Skopjeans" inhabit the smaller part of 
"historic Macedonia, and because the previous New Democracy [ND] 
government had recognized the name `Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia,' which includes the term `Macedonia.'" 
<H5>  ND Official's Views </H5>
  In an interview with Panos Sokos published in the 14 May 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA, ND deputy and former Foreign Minister Mikhalis 
Papakonstandinou told Sokos he agreed with Pangalos that the 
"Skopje state" is located in what has been known as "Macedonia" 
from antiquity and opined that the alternate foreign affairs 
minister is "always or almost always on the right track." In the 
interview Papakonstandinou offered two interpretations of 
Pangalos' remarks: that he spoke on his own, or that his 
statement was a "trial balloon" coordinated with the government 
intended to gauge public reaction. However, Papakonstandinou 
remarked, the government ought to be more daring if it agrees 
with Pangalos, or else government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
should not have stressed that only Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's statements on the Skopje issue are valid, for this 
implies that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be abolished. 
<H5>  Skopje's "Threat" </H5>
  According to international relations professor Panayiotis 
Ifaistos, writing in the 9 May ELEVTHEROTIPIA, it is an 
"oversimplification" to say that the "Skopje republic" [FYROM] 
is not a threat to Greece and that Greeks are possessed by 
"collective hysteria" on this subject. First, while Greece 
wishes to coexist with Skopje--and this might even be profitable 
if it were possible--this state is a "constant destabilizing 
factor" in the Balkans because, "rent by internal contradictions 
and external interventions," it is not "viable." Second, even if 
the FYROM Army is presently "insignificant," it could be 
"strengthened by inimical forces," complicating if not seriously 
destabilizing Greek strategic estimates and weakening Greece's 
deterrent force in the face of the Turkish threat, Ifaistos 
continued. Third, it is "unrealistic" to believe that only a few 
"Skopjeans" are "chauvinists and anti-Greek," while the majority 
are "friendly" to Greece and could easily be won over. In fact, 
Ifaistos commented, relations between states are not guided by 
"friendship and individual sentiments," but by complicated 
collective interests and geopolitical parameters. Greece, he 
wrote, is vitally interested in a stable and viable Balkans 
area, which will only materialize if Athens acts seriously like 
a "modern" country to influence the regional balance of power. 
"If Greek strategy is well planned, we should not have to beg 
[FYROM President] Gligorov to be our friend; he should be 
begging us to save him," Ifaistos concluded.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel returned to Turkey today 
from official visits to Ukraine and Moldova. On the last day of 
his visit, various agreements were signed between Turkey and 
Moldova envisaging friendship and cooperation. 
  The president held a news conference at Ankara Esenboga 
Airport on his return and assessed his visits. He pointed out 
that the visits added strong and rich contents to the relations 
between Turkey and Ukraine and Moldova. He said: I have come 
back from a historic embrace with our Turkic brothers. 
  Demirel pointed out that in Ukraine, he gave the message 
that 
Turkey is a good friend, a useful neighbor, and a serious 
cooperation partner for that country. He said that an agreement 
in principle was reached to jointly build a Mediterranean-Black 
Sea oil pipeline, and other agreements were signed in highway 
transportation and tourism. He added: These are basic 
agreements that will enable our peoples and our business circles 
to engage in deeper and more beneficial cooperation relations, 
and they complement agreements signed earlier. We also took a 
very important step during our visit in affirming that the 
Crimean Turks -- one of the historical owners of Ukrainian lands 
-- constitute a real bridge of friendship and cooperation in the 
relations between our two countries. We announced our good news 
that as a contribution of the Turkish nation to the return of 
the Crimean Turks to their historical homeland, we will build 
1,000 homes in Crimea. This will be the first international aid 
to the Crimean Turks ever since they started to return to their 
homeland. 
  The president said that during his visit to Moldova, he gave 
the Moldovan officials the message that they can trust Turkey's 
friendship and that Turkey will try to extend every possible 
kind of aid to that country. He stressed that the visit built 
the strong legal foundations of the bilateral relations based on 
agreements. 
  Demirel pointed out that eight agreements were signed with 
Moldova on transportation, agriculture, culture, the fight 
against organized crime, and so on. The most important of these 
agreements, he said, was the agreement on friendship and 
cooperation. 
  Demirel said: We reached an agreement on a $35 million 
Eximbank loan -- which was being discussed for some time -- to 
be used in the development projects in the Gagauz region. 
Meanwhile, in the framework of another agreement, the Turkish 
Cooperation and Development Agency will open an office in 
Kishinev. 
  President Demirel pointed out that during his visit, he 
toured the Gagauz region accompanied by the Moldovan president. 
He added that he had the opportunity to observe the rich 
customs and traditions of the Gagauz Turks. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister 
Mehmet Kostepen returned to Turkey with President Demirel.

<F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin from Kiev] </F>
  [Excerpt] Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures, whom we met 
while seeing President Demirel off to Kiev, announced that 
Russia is posing a greater danger to Turkey than it used to 
during the Cold War. Stressing that our northern neighbor has 
started threatening our borders, General Gures said: "I 
inserted this fact into the official records of one of the NATO 
meetings." 
  During our airport meeting, we asked the chief of General 
Staff his views on relations between the Russian Federation and 
Turkey, military and political developments abroad, and the 
latest developments concerning the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]. 
The chief of General Staff, who for the first time felt the 
need to reply to the abundant verbal threats against our country 
coming from the officials of the Russian Federation, said 
"Russia is now posing a greater threat than it used to during 
the Cold War," and added: "Russia is also threatening our 
borders. Each day it flies 40 planes to Armenia, which is at 
war with Azerbaijan. It is sending arms and military hardware 
on board these planes." 
  When asked about the latest developments in relations 
between 
the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and Turkey, he made the 
following assessment: "Nakhichevan is not in danger. This is 
because Turkey has already expressed its resolute position on 
this matter. There is no need to repeat that. Besides, a very 
important Azerbaijani military force, a brigade, is stationed in 
Nakhichevan. For these reasons, it will not be easy to attack 
Nakhichevan." 
  Disclosing that in one of NATO meetings last year he 
strongly 
objected to the Russian chief of General Staff's statement that 
they would sent Russian forces to the former Soviet republics 
and regional countries, Gen. Gures said: "In reaction, I 
inserted into NATO official records the need to send a 
multinational force under CSCE supervision." Noting that at 
this same meeting the German chief of General Staff supported 
his views on this matter, Gures said that "thus Russia's 
dangerous intentions were obstructed." 
  The chief of General Staff reiterated the existence of the 
Russian threat by saying: "I repeat, Russia now poses a far 
greater threat than it used to during the Cold War era." He 
continued with the following important statements and 
assessments: "Russia wants to annex Crimea. I want to draw 
attention to this fact. The Turks in Crimea are in a critical 
situation. Our esteemed president is visiting Ukraine at such a 
critical period. And, look at Georgia, where Russia is on the 
verge of bringing that country under its control. The Russians 
want to send troops to Azerbaijan, but the latter is resisting 
it." 
  Asked to comment on reports that a coup is being prepared 
against Azerbaijani President Aliyev, Gures said: "They cannot 
do anything to Aliyev, but unfortunately such preparations 
exist." 
<H5>  Apo Is Finished </H5>
  In reply to our question on the PKK, General Gures said the 
operations have been very successful and this separatist 
organization started to vanish sooner than expected. Gures 
said: "I thought they would surrender in September. But it 
happened sooner than that. I can state that the PKK, which is 
now on the verge of collapse, will eventually turn into an urban 
terror organization. The PKK will become an organization like 
Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left Organization]." 
  Asked what will become of Apo [alias for PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan], Gures said: "I do not know.... He might flee. He is 
already looking for a place to escape to." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that it will 
be possible very soon to pump out the oil in the 
Karkuk-Yumurtalik for restoration purposes. 
  Answering reporters' questions at the prime minister's 
residence, Ciller said they have been trying to explain to the 
world why it is necessary to pump the oil out of the 
Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline in spite of the embargo imposed 
on Iraq, and added: A unity of understanding has been 
developing in world public opinion in recent months. 
  Stressing that the oil pipeline should be considered one of 
Turkey's investments, Ciller said: The embargo is not imposed 
on Turkey. There is oil in the pipeline and some of that oil 
belongs to us. We have to pump out this oil in order to repair, 
restore, and conduct maintenance work, and we are explaining 
this to the world. In my last visit to the United States, I 
discussed this issue. In the past, the issue was being assessed 
within the framework of the embargo. I see a slightly different 
approach developing now. I am very hopeful on this issue, and I 
believe it will be possible to conduct repair work in the near 
future. 
  In answer to a question, Ciller said discussions on the oil 
pipeline are being conducted in various circles, including with 
the UN secretary general, and added: The world has become a 
smaller place. Turkey has led the world in certain issues. We 
sided with the human rights issue when Iraq was the aggressor. 
That decision was right then, but the decision on the oil 
pipeline is the right one for now. The embargo is not imposed 
on us, but it is destroying our investments -- millions of 
dollars of investments. We cannot allow these investments to be 
wasted. The world also should not allow this. I think we have 
explained our situation satisfactorily.

  [Text] Progress has been achieved in the talks being held 
in Washington between Turkey and the United States in connection 
with the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline. 
  Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk, who is 
holding contacts in Washington in connection with the pipeline, 
has said that the U.S. Administration has quite a constructive 
attitude regarding the matter. He said the U.S. Administration 
told him that the United States will display an attitude in line 
with Turkey's requests at the United Nations. Sanberk stressed 
that Turkey will act while remaining loyal to the UN sanctions 
imposed on Iraq. Encouraging developments are taking place, he 
said, indicating that the oil in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline 
will be pumped out this year. 
  After Washington, Sanberk will go to New York to discuss 
with 
the permanent representatives at the UN Security Council the 
need to pump out the oil in the pipeline for technical reasons.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that there 
is no difference of opinion between Turkey and the UN Security 
Council members about eliminating the losses incurred from the 
oil sitting in the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline for the past four 
years. He stressed, however, that it appears that the operation 
to rescue the pipeline cannot be carried out without regard for 
the embargo on Iraq or by ignoring the United Nations. 
  Cetin was replying to questions at Ankara's Esenboga Airport 
after seeing off the Thai foreign minister. Cetin pointed out 
that the problem does not concern the United Nations alone and 
that the Iraqi side should not be ignored. He added: This must 
be done on common ground with Iraq. As far as we understand, 
Iraq will not export the oil and no resources will be 
transferred to Iraq. Consequently, we are continuing to explain 
that this is a special operation. After our contacts with the 
United Nations, we will contact Iraq once again if necessary and 
try to reach a solution for the issue. 
  Replying to a question, Cetin said that no conclusion has 
been reached during the talks in New York about whether Iraq's 
share of the revenues from the oil in the pipeline will be 
placed in the UN compensation account. He said: In light of 
these negotiations, we will either say that an agreement has 
been reached and act accordingly, or we will say that the 
differences of opinion will be discussed again. In other words, 
the process is under way. I believe that it will continue. 
Turkey is right. I do not believe there is a way back from 
here.

  [Text] Ankara, June 5 (A.A.) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese said on Sunday [5 June] that 349 terrorists were killed 
in the last 20 days and 32 others surrendered to security forces. 
  Mentese speaking about the operations launched against the 
separatist terrorist organization between May 15 and June 4 said 
the government is resolved to eradicate terrorism to provide the 
security of people. 
  Mentese said the separatist organization is in panic after 
its great loss `the organization also lost logistic support' he 
added. 
  He said in the recent days the organization avoids meeting 
security forces and started less risky activities like road 
blocking `however, security forces take necessary measures 
against these attacks,' he added. 
  Interior minister said rebellion has started within the 
organization as it lost morale after operations launched by 
security forces `the organization takes strict measures to 
prevent members to flee,' he added. 
  Mentese said 129 terrorists were killed in Hakkari, 43 in 
Sirnak, 29 in Siirt, 28 in Adiyaman, 18 in Erzincan, 18 in Mus, 
26 in Diyarbakir, 17 in Agri, 12 in Bingol, and nine in Bitlis

  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that all 
ethnic groups in Turkey enjoy equal rights, adding that the 
terms Kurdish identity and Kurdish political rights are part of 
a plot hatched by foreign circles. He explained that the state 
and security forces are very successful against separatist 
terrorism. The regional people agree with us, he said, and they 
come and thank us. 
  Mentese chaired a meeting of the Prime Minister's State of 
Emergency Coordination Council in Ankara today. In an opening 
speech, Mentese denied the claims that the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] is fighting for the Kurdish identity or for the 
freedom of the Kurdish people. He said that the press and the 
citizens of Kurdish origin living in southeastern Anatolia are 
being misled about this issue. Certain circles are trying to 
spread the rumor that there is a Kurdish problem, he said, 
adding that the PKK is merely a terrorist organization that 
sheds blood mercilessly. He asked: How can one say that this 
organization fights for the freedom of the Kurdish people? 
  The interior minister said the council will review the 
short-, medium-, and long-term measures to be taken regarding 
this issue.

  [Text] The armed units of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
[PUK]--headed by Jalal Talabani, a former guerrilla leader--have 
been caught in a cross fire as a result of Iran's intervention 
in the fighting in northern Iraq. The Iranian Revolution Guards 
launched an attack and pounded Halabjah. As a consequence, 
Talabani's units were caught between the Iranian forces and 
Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani's 
armed groups. They were forced to withdraw from Halabjah. 
  Iran's intervention quickly changed the balance in the 
fighting, which has been continuing in the region since 1 May. 
PUK Spokesman Sarcil Kazaz has disclosed that the people have 
decided to move out of Halabjah for security reasons. In a 
statement in Damascus, Kazaz said the pounding has forced 
thousands of people to flee to the mountains. 
  Meanwhile, Mas'ud Barzani has denied reports that Iran 
supports the DPK in the fighting. It is common knowledge, 
however, that the Islamic Movement and the Kurdistan 
Revolutionary Hizbullah Organization support the DPK. Both of 
those organizations are supported by Iran. 
  The experts say the Iranian Government wishes to eliminate 
the autonomous region in northern Iraq by weakening the Kurds 
and provoking the fighting. The supporters of Talabani and 
Barzani have clashed over a disputed area. At least 250 people 
have been killed in the fighting thus far. The two sides 
concluded a cease-fire agreement on 20 May. However, clashes 
have continued in various areas close to Iran's border since 
then.

<F P=106> [Column by Gungor Mengi: "Shameful!"] </F>
  [Text] We seriously suffer from the existing problems, not 
because they are very complex but because we waste time. For 
example, we have been troubled by separatist and terrorist 
activities over the past 10 years. Had the state been aware of 
the realities and allowed the professionals to continue the 
struggle against terrorism, the problem would have been resolved 
a long time ago, before it assumed dangerous proportions. The 
continuation of terrorist activities has not only harmed the 
people's unity but also wasted many resources, which could have 
been used for development. 
  Meanwhile, several foreign countries, in an effort to impose 
their policies on Ankara, have used the separatist and terrorist 
activities against Turkey. The photograph that was published in 
SABAH on page one yesterday clearly indicates the way the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] has been used to implement the 
ugly designs of foreign forces against Turkey. The photograph 
depicted PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan standing beside an Armenian 
priest, as if waiting for instructions and funds! 
  It is common knowledge that many of the Armenian people are 
hostile to Turkey, so much so that they would not mind upsetting 
their life. However, what can be said about Greece? 
  Terrorism is a very serious crime against humanity. A 
country may find itself isolated for supporting terrorist 
activities in the world. In fact, the countries that have been 
isolated in the Middle East are not few. The suspicion Greece 
has aroused on the matter may place that country in a more 
degrading and despicable situation than that of Libya and Syria. 
  Obviously, several of Turkey's neighbors are supporting the 
PKK in order to impose their policies on Ankara. However, 
Greece is using that organization to promote its trade and 
increase its revenues in the tourism domain. Tourists left 
Turkey and made reservations in the Greek islands after bombs 
exploded in Antalya in 1993. We wrote in this column at the 
time that the state should abandon its timid approach and take 
daring steps to deal with the matter. We urged the state to 
properly assess the evidence and act accordingly. However, that 
has not been done. Bombs exploded in the middle of the tourism 
season in 1993. Explosions took place even before the tourism 
season began in 1994. 
  Former President Kenan Evren has not hesitated to blame 
Greece. No one in his position would dare blame any country on 
mere suspicion and without official information. 
  Turkey must persuade its neighbors not to use the PKK as a 
means to promote their interests. The silence that has been 
maintained has increased the number of countries which use the 
PKK as an instrument against Turkey. 
  Using acts of terrorism against a neighboring country is 
shameful. However, it is even more shameful to condone such a 
behavior in order to "avoid creasing problems."

  [Text] Istanbul, June 3 (A.A.) -- Israeli Economics and 
Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit said on Thursday [2 June] that 
Turkey had a great potential and was capable of easily 
overcoming its current economic bottleneck. 
  In an arrival statement at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport, 
Shetrit, on an official visit to Turkey, said that his country 
faced certain economic hardships in the eighties, with an 
inflation rate skyrocketing to 300-500 percent annually. 
  He added that the current inflation rate in his country was 
around 10 percent and to achieve this, a consensus was necessary 
among the government, businessmen, and trade unions. 
  He said that the current trade volume between the two 
countries was not sufficient. 
  The visiting minister will hold contacts with officials in 
Istanbul and Ankara.

Economics and Planning, Shim'on Shetrit, currently on an 
official visit in Turkey, on Friday [3 June] met with State 
Minister Aykon Dogan. 
  During meetings between delegations of both countries, both 
sides reiterated mutual wishes that the free trade agreement 
procedure between Turkey and Israel should be finalized in the

considers Turkey a country with great potential in the Middle 
East in economic, political and social fields. 
  Dogan also said that a great number of Israeli tourists were 
expected in Turkey in 1994, and Turkey also aims to increase its 
exports to Israel. 
  He added that Israel is also interested in investments in 
industry, tourism, transport and in the irrigation projects in 
Southeastern Anatolian Project (GAP) region. 
  Dogan said that Turkey has a unifying characteristic in the 
region adding, Israeli businessmen have also mentioned such 
projects as entering into joint partnership projects with 
Turkey's experience aiming at the CIS countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Economics and Planning Minister </F>
Shim'on Shetrit by Metin Gokce in Ankara on 3 June -- recorded, 
in English with superimposed translation into Turkish] 
  [Text] [Gokce] How do you view the future of economic 
relations between Turkey and Israel, two important countries in 
the Middle East? 
  [Shetrit] I believe there are several common aspects. You 
are a democratic country; so is Israel. You respect your 
religion, but are secular at the same time. We also respect our 
religion and we are a secular society. The policies of both 
countries are western-oriented. You support the free market 
economy based on social justice, and so do we. I believe that 
we can cooperate successfully on the basis of these common 
characteristics. There is a potential for great cooperation 
between our countries. The current volume of bilateral trade of 
$250 million is not sufficient. This year's reciprocal tourist 
activities will add another $200 million to this figure. 
Hundreds of thousands of Israeli tourists are visiting Turkey. 
This is an indication of the Israeli people's confidence in 
Turkey and in the Turkish economy. I am also very positive on 
this matter. 
  [Gokce] Could you give more details about the areas of 
cooperation you mention? 
  [Shetrit] For example, cooperation can be undertaken in 
various areas on the basis of a triangular model to be 
established among Turkey, Israel, and the Palestinians within 
the framework of the Palestinian autonomy project. I am hopeful 
about the trade talks to be held in July. Moreover, I am also 
optimistic about the future of bilateral relations. 
  [Gokce] How do you view the future of the Peace Water 
Project? 
  [Shetrit] There is plenty of water in Turkey. The Middle 
East, however, has meager water resources. I am convinced that 
your abundant waters will one day reach the region in order to 
solve the sensitive water problem in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "All the Talk About Provide </F>
Comfort"] 
  [Text] The Parliament has to act at the end of this month 
for the extension of the mandate of the "Provide Comfort" force, 
which was set up by the United States, Britain and France to 
protect the Kurds of northern Iraq against Saddam Husayn and his 
troops. Turkey has been the host country to the force with 
"certain misgivings." 
  Many hawks in the military hierarchy have claimed the force 
has contributed to the strengthening of the clandestine Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in northern Iraq. They say the PKK has 
effectively used the safe haven in northern Iraq to train the 
terrorists who have wreaked havoc in southeastern Turkey. 
  We hear that some people in the government are inclined to 
use the extension of the mandate of "Provide Comfort" as a 
bargaining chip against the American move to link U.S. aid to 
Turkey with human rights and the Cyprus question. 
  At first the claims surfaced when the final communique after 
Saturday's [28 May] National Security Council failed to mention 
that the council has recommended to the government the extension 
of the mandate of the force for another six months. The mandate 
of the force ends at the close of this month and the Turkish 
Parliament has to vote on it before June 29 if the force is to 
stay on in Turkey. The next meeting of the council will not take 
place before the Parliament is required to act on the extension. 
So the possibility emerged that, because the final communique 
did not mention the matter, the "extension" of Provide Comfort 
could be in jeopardy.... 
  The government gave out confused signals which did not help. 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin ruled out any "blackmail" 
concerning "Provide Comfort," while Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin said Washington should draw the appropriate 
conclusions from the fact that the National Security Council did 
not mention the extension of "Provide Comfort"... 
  The TURKISH DAILY NEWS later learnt that the council did 
discuss "Provide Comfort" and probably gave the go-ahead to the 
extension without publicly announcing it, just to give 
Washington the jitters. 
  So all this business of "defying" Washington and telling it 
to take its "Provide Comfort" force out of Turkey is just empty 
talk. Turkey is in no position to use "Provide Comfort" as a 
trump card, especially when the allies could move the force to 
southern Cyprus and deny us a very important leverage on 
northern Iraq and the Iraqi Kurds.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "So at Last the Mouse Decided To </F>
Roar"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has once again proved 
her courage by allegedly standing up to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and telling him what he can do with his assistance to 
Turkey.... The prime minister, who is currently on a "private" 
visit to the United States to attend her son's graduation 
ceremony, told reporters she had a telephone call from Clinton 
in Boston and that during the conversation she told the American 
head of state that Turkey "may" reject U.S. military aid after a 
U.S. congressional decision to withhold part of it pending 
reports on human rights in Turkey and the Cyprus question. 
  "I told U.S. President (Bill) Clinton that I will reject 
foreign aid if necessary," the gallant prime minister declared. 
She said that she told the President she could not explain the 
aid cut to the Turkish public and that Clinton in return 
promised to do all he can to restore full aid. 
  In Sunday's [29 May] Turkish national dailies the news was 
billed as an act of courage on the part of the prime minister. 
  We too oppose the American congressional move to attach 
strings to aid to Turkey. We do not feel such aid should be 
used as a leverage on Turkey because above all this makes us 
suspect the motives of those who suspended the aid. As we 
mentioned in our earlier commentaries, the fact that the Greek 
lobby once again introduced the Cyprus card into the aid package 
shows the lack of sincerity and goodwill in the aid-cutting 
decision. The fact is that, while the congressional move 
mentions human rights in Turkey, it actually plays upon the 
"Kurdish card" rather than showing a genuine concern for the 
plight of freedoms and rights in Turkey-- which we too feel are 
in a shambles. 
  Yet, we feel this issue should not have been blown up out of 
proportion. The prime minister, while using the issue for 
domestic consumption, is doing great harm to Turco-American 
relations. Certain people seem to be completing in 
anti-Americanism and will only capitalize on Ciller's remarks. 
We should not forget that similar American Congressional 
committees also lambasted Greece for its pro-Serbian stance and 
withheld aid. We should also remember that the American 
Administration and the State Department share our views on the 
importance of maintaining warm ties between Ankara and 
Washington, and realize such congressional actions harm these 
relations. 
  Can Ciller openly say we do not need any Western assistance? 
All the leading Western countries who maintain close links with 
Turkey have been rather forceful on our human rights record, as 
well as on Cyprus. Can anyone say we do not need their aid at a 
time when Ciller is on a "fund raising" tour? Will people 
believe her when she says we "might" turn down U.S. assistance 
when Turkey is in serious need of foreign cash? Can Ciller fly 
her choppers in southeastern Turkey without American aid? Can 
she and her military friends effectively fight Kurdish 
separatist terrorism without American and German military aid? 
Does Turkey have the hard cash to do all this without outside 
assistance? Doesn't Ciller know that it is the Americans who 
are the leading contributors to the IMF which will provide the 
vital loans for Turkey to keep our economy afloat? 
  Turkey and the U.S. share common and vital interests and 
thus 
need to be good allies. They will need each other for a very 
long time to come and it is time certain U.S. congressmen, 
Ciller herself, and many other people who try to drum up 
anti-American sentiment in Turkey, realize this.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Development Minister Michel Roussin: "France </F>
and Rwanda: Putting an End to Unfair Accusations"] 
  [Text] A vast manhunt has caused destruction and bloodshed 
in Rwanda. This is a daily horror story for hundreds of 
thousands of men, women, and children who are hounded, 
mutilated, and murdered. Faced with such a tragedy, how can we 
fail to feel terror, astonishment, and indignation? A feeling 
of impotence overcomes us, given the scale of this tragedy. 
There is only one certainty: The international community has a 
duty to show solidarity with Rwanda. 
  France -- as it has demonstrated -- is not shirking its 
responsibilities. But it cannot act alone. 
  1. Many French people discovered, through this tragedy, how 
close the links were between France and Rwanda. Some turned 
them into a caricature and only remembered support deemed to be 
excessive for a regime which was nonetheless changing. 
Franco-Rwandan cooperation is different from that: It is 
primarily aid to the population of the order of 100 million 
francs [Fr] in 1992 in sectors as varied as coffee, rice, and 
forestry. It is also the presence of nongovernmental 
organizations (NGO) and local French communities. In 1993 
France, together with Belgium, was Rwanda's main partner. But 
there were many countries cooperating with this country: 
Germany, the United States, Switzerland, and Canada. 
  It is precisely because France was a major partner that it 
became involved in the changes in that country. On 1 October 
1990, armed elements of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) -- who 
had, it will be remembered, come from Uganda -- entered Rwanda. 
The discussions which opened between the Rwandan Government and 
the RPF led to the signing of a peace agreement in Arusha on 4 
August 1993. These agreements, concluded with the support of 
various countries in the region and of the whole international 
community, were implemented by President Habyarimana. They led 
to a process of political openness which was unprecedented in 
Rwanda's history: Recognition of 14 political parties, revision 
of the Constitution, then liberalization of the press, a 
transitional government with an expanded base, in other words 
expanded to include the Tutsi minority which obtained five out 
of 21 ministries, and the creation of a new national army. The 
RPF expressed "its most sincere thanks for the role of observer 
in our negotiations played by France." 
  2. The murder of President Habyarimana suddenly interrupted 
this change. What was to be done then? 
<H5>  The Security of French People </H5>
  Faced with the rapidly developing insecurity, the French 
Government's first duty was to ensure the safety of its 
nationals. Would anybody have understood it if we had left our 
600 fellow citizens in Rwanda in the middle of the massacres? 
The risks were real: Three Frenchmen were killed shortly after 
the events started. We also brought home 900 other threatened 
individuals, including those Rwandan employees of the 
cooperation services who wished to leave. The family of the 
murdered president was also evacuated. It is strange to say 
that France should be criticized for acting in this way: Other 
countries may have felt it right to abandon the families of the 
leaders with whom they had hitherto maintained normal relations. 
Doing likewise would have condemned them to death. Our 
traditions are different. The comparison between the welcome 
given to President Habyarimana's family and aid for the Rwandan 
population is pointless, as the figures show. 
  This immediate action by France to help its nationals was 
immediately accompanied by humanitarian aid for the Rwandan 
population. This aid is the biggest contribution from the 
international community. Having said that, there are still vast 
requirements which must be satisfied. It is our duty not to 
remain inactive. Health Minister Douste-Blazy has gone to the 
region, to Burundi and Tanzania where more than 300,000 people 
have taken refuge. That visit made it possible to identify the 
needs and respond to them without delay: dispatch of trucks, 
and water purification equipment. 
  Humanitarian aid is certainly not a substitute for political 
action. But, it must be remembered that there cannot be a 
military solution to the Rwandan tragedy. Only negotiation on 
the basis of the Arusha agreements will make it possible to 
establish a lasting peace and to overcome the hatred in time. 
  3. This is why everybody must now shoulder his 
responsibilities to ensure that solidarity with Rwanda is more 
than just a slogan: 
  * The Rwandans first: Without a minimum of agreement among 
the parties, a UN intervention is doomed to failure. Rwanda 
must want to live at peace with itself. It has shown in its 
recent history, between 1990 and 1993, that violence can break 
out there suddenly and brutally. It is not to "ethnicize" the 
conflict to recall its historical antecedents: the existence of 
a Tutsi dynasty, the 1959 revolution, the social and economic 
issues of the interethnic rivalry, the displacement of 
populations (130,000 Tutsi exiles back in 1963). The ethnic 
rationale is still relevant. Only its gradual elimination will 
enable this country to live in peace. 
  * The Africans must mobilize. The Arusha agreements were 
concluded thanks to the aid of Rwanda's neighbors. 
<H5>  Judging Those Responsible </H5>
  Today, Africa remains silent about the biggest human 
disaster 
of the end of this century. No stance has been taken, no 
condemnation has been made, there has been no public protest. 
The political leaders, the intellectuals, the African citizens 
seem to be paralyzed. How can we explain this astonishing 
silence in face of a tragedy taking place on their doorstep? 
Africa must react in order to end this suffering. 
  * The international community also delayed a long time in 
taking any initiatives. 
  France, convinced of the need for diplomatic action, has 
used 
all its influence in the Security Council to ensure that the 
United Nations shoulders its responsibilities. It is prepared 
to help the African countries which want to place contingents at 
the disposal of the United Nations. France is prepared to do 
anything useful to speed up the deployment of this force or its 
strengthening. I hope that our other partners will do likewise. 
  Finally, France has asked the UN Human Rights Commission to 
identify those responsible for this genocide and to judge and 
condemn them. 
  Glimmers of hope are appearing. In Kigali, the blue helmets 
have succeeded in evacuating hundreds of civilians to safe 
areas. The RPF military officials and those of the Rwandan Army 
have opened preliminary discussions to reach a cease-fire. 
There is therefore no inevitability because the sides involved 
agree to negotiate. 
  Africa and the international community must not show 
indifference. 
  France, for its part, has not forgotten Rwanda.

  [Excerpt] "The situation is worse than was thought. 
Without a very wide-ranging commitment by a number of 
governments, European and non-European, the Rwandan crisis will 
widen." This was said by the Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, 
Franco Rocchetta, in Nairobi, where he was brought back by the 
UN plane which was forced to return to the Kenyan capital from 
Rwandan shelling in Kigali. 
  Rocchetta added that the Italian Government must remain 
neutral with regard to both ethnic groups involved in the 
fighting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis today expressed the 
conviction that all the right conditions exist for the National 
Council to reach a consensus regarding the future direction of 
the Cyprus issue, in light of the Butrus-Ghali report. Speaking 
after the meeting of the National Council this morning, 
President Kliridhis said that the Greek Cypriot side should not 
celebrate about the Butrus-Ghali report because a report is not 
a solution of the Cyprus issue. However, he described the UN 
secretary general's position -- that efforts to solve the Cyprus 
issue have gone on for years but have not produced results 
because the Turkish side does not have the political will -- as 
very positive. 
  President Kliridhis said that during the National Council 
meeting today, there was a very good discussion which will 
continue Wednesday [8 June] after the political parties discuss 
the whole issue in their respective committees. The president 
said that during the meeting, he made suggestions to the parties 
and then a discussion followed. He said that before we go to 
Athens for discussions, we will decide what line we will follow, 
but we will not announce any decisions that we make here. Asked 
when the political leadership will go to Athens for talks, the 
president said the trip would take place after the 12 June 
elections for European Parliament. It should be noted that 
immediately following the National Council meeting, the 
president received Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis, whom he 
briefed about the Council's meeting. 
  The National Council meeting was attended by Ioannis Matsis 
and Alekos Markidhis on behalf of the Democratic Rally [DISI], 
Dhimitrios Khristofias and Andreas Khristou on behalf of AKEL 
[Restorative Party of the Working People], Spiros Kiprianou and 
Tasos Papadhopoulos on behalf of DIKO [Democratic Party], and 
Vasos Lissaridhis and Takis Khatzidhimistriou on behalf of EDEK 
[United Democratic Union of Cyprus]. The meeting was also 
attended by House of Representatives President Alexis Galanos, 
Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, and Ioannis Kasoulidhis, 
deputy minister to President Pandelis Kouros and government 
spokesman.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Kiriakidhis] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Analyzing the contents of UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report and the positions 
of the Cypriot Government on the new facts and options that 
result from the report, President Glavkos Kliridhis has made an 
important and instructive statement. 
  Kliridhis described paragraph 62 of the Butrus-Ghali report 
as the most significant. According to that paragraph, before we 
retreat to any of the alternatives that are mentioned in the 
report, we could hold negotiations, even an international 
conference, to find answers to some principles that must govern 
a solution. He added that an international conference does not 
have the same limitations as the UN Security Council or veto 
rights (unanimity) over a decision. The president also noted 
that in his report the UN secretary general mentions five 
options, but does not recommend them. On the contrary, he 
added, the UN secretary general ruled out some of them and 
warned "do not take this course because it will be fruitless." 
Kliridhis stressed: Therefore, Butrus-Ghali is clearly telling 
the Security Council that continuing a dialogue would lead 
nowhere, so another way to overcome the Cyprus issue must be 
found. 
  Referring to continuing the talks on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's], Kliridhis commented on two of the 
alternatives, noting that this procedure exists "only 
theoretically" because the Turkish Cypriot side has no political 
will for a solution. He also ruled out talks on the substance 
of the issue because he sees no possibility of success. He 
said: On the other hand, to resume the CBM's process would 
require concessions by both sides. So, it is up to us whether 
this will happen or not. 
  Commenting on Butrus-Ghali's report, President Kliridhis 
noted the following basic points: 
  a) The efforts over many years to resolve the Cyprus issue 
did not bear fruit because the Turkish side lacks political will. 
  b) The UN secretary general ascertained that continuing this 
procedure, either by discussing the substance of the Cyprus 
issue or the CBM's, will not lead to a solution but will lead 
nowhere as long as one of the interlocutors has no political 
will for an agreement. He stressed that he considers the report 
positive, but added that a report is not a solution to the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Answering questions on the possibility of appealing to the 
UN 
General Assembly, Kliridhis said the appeal could include his 
demilitarization proposal, the issue of the settlers, or the 
possibility of an international conference that would determine 
the framework and principles for a Cyprus solution. He 
reiterated that it can no longer be argued that an appeal to the 
General Assembly would affect the talks negatively because there 
are no talks anymore. 
  President Kliridhis confirmed press reports that the Turkish 
side had submitted a proposal for partitioning Famagusta, but 
said that he rejected it unreservedly. The proposal was made at 
the Vienna talks; and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, conveyed 
it to Kliridhis by telephone. According to the proposal, the 
Turkish side was "willing" to "give up" the part south of 
Dhimokratias Street and Ayios Memnonas if it could take the part 
north of Dhimokratias Street and the port (and colonize it with 
Turkish Cypriots).

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Turkey 
continues to carry out a slanderous campaign against Greece and 
to bring unfounded charges by invoking events that are obviously 
contrary to the reality. The spokesman made the above statement 
when he was asked about the government's comment regarding the 
confession of the Kurdish fighter who was tortured by Turkish 
authorities into saying that he had been trained at a camp for 
terrorists in Greece. Venizelos underlined once again that our 
country will not contribute to the effort to cultivate false 
tension. We call on Turkey, the spokesman said, to stop 
implicating Greece in its internal problems. The Greek state 
authority, Venizelos stressed, controls the whole of its 
territory which is open and accessible to everyone, especially 
to journalists. Finally, the government spokesman expressed the 
government's regret for the confirmation of brutal violation of 
human rights, such as in the case of detained persons subjected 
to torture to sign forged confessions.

<F P=106> [Article by Gallup Institute and Bjorn Moller: "Social </F>
Democrats Poised for Advance"] 
  [Excerpts] The Social Democratic Party (SDP) is poised to 
make significant gains in the election for the European 
Parliament, according to a new Gallup poll. But at the same time 
the Liberals are holding steady. 
  Every three weeks in advance of the European Parliament 
election the Gallup Institute has conducted a survey on popular 
support for the parties and lists currently in the running. 
  The poll shows that 59 percent of the voters have now 
decided 
to vote for a particular party or list, and this is a clear rise 
in relation to the corresponding poll conducted 10 days earlier 
in which 51 percent had decided on a party. Not surprising, the 
share who are still in doubt has at the same time fallen from 35 
to 29 percent of voters. 
  The poll shows that the SDP is now looking at a significant 
gain, both in relation to preceding poll and to the European 
Parliament election in 1989. In that year the SDP got 23.3 
percent of the votes, and this is also where the party stood in 
the poll of 15 May. 
  In the current survey, the party has an 8-percent gain -- to 
a strong 31 percent of voters. Accordingly, the SDP has gained 
the support among many who only recently have made their party 
selection. It is interesting that the SDP is just as strong 
among both yes and no voters who had decided on a party in the 
European Union [EU] referendum of 18 May 1993. Among yes voters, 
the party gets 31 percent, while among no voters it gets 30 
percent. 
  The election's big winner, however, still appears to be the 
Liberals. In the preceding Gallup poll, that party had 28 
percent of votes among those who had decided on a party, and an 
equally large share supports the party in the current poll. 
  But it can accordingly be said that Liberal voters decided 
early on this party, and for many people this was surely because 
of the Liberals' clear stance on the EU. 
  Specifically, the party has very strong support among those 
who voted yes in the 1993 EU referendum. Some 39 percent of the 
yes voters from 1993 who had chosen a party then will vote for 
the Liberals this time, while only 9 percent of the referendum 
no voters intend to cast their ballot for the party this time. 
[passage omitted] 
  The statistical margin of error in these polls is between 1 
and 3 percent, so that it is smallest for the parties with less 
support and largest for parties with more support. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  SDP Storming Ahead for EU Election </H5>
  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) has fresh 
ammunition when he shows up to wrestle Liberals' Chairman Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen [for a debate] on TV 2. 
  The prime minister can brag about an especially strong poll 
gain for his party just three weeks before the election to the 
European Parliament. [passage omitted] 
  "This is fantastically neat," says Frank Jensen, the party 
political spokesman. He is not in doubt that the gain is 
especially due to the prime minister's performance in the TV 
duel with Ellemann-Jensen last week. At the same time, he also 
thinks that the SDP campaign has begun to have an effect. 
  "The TV debate showed that the prime minister can deliver 
the 
goods despite Uffe's effective debating style. At the same time, 
it is clear that it is no longer just a matter of yes or no for 
the EU," says Jensen. 
  The poll moreover underlines that the Liberal Party is the 
main opponent of the SDP. The Liberals held steady at 28 
percent, compared with 16.6 percent in the 1989 election. 
Generally all others declined. 
  Of the 1,597 interviewed, 59 percent had decided on a party. 
This is 8 percent more than 10 days ago. 
  The poll was conducted 13-23 May 1994, during which a 
representative sample of 1,597 eligible Danish voters were 
contacted by phone.

<F P=106> [Louise Fleischer report: "Radical Liberals Picking Up </F>
Voters"] 
  [Text] The government would lose a total of 16 seats if 
there were an election now. Both the Christian People's Party 
and the Center Democrats [CD] would disappear from the Folketing. 
  While both the CD and the Christian People's Party are 
likely 
to be completely erased from the Folketing, the Radical Liberals 
would make marked gains if there were a Folketing election now. 
  The party would have 10 seats against its current 7. This is 
shown by an opinion poll that Gallup has carried out for 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. 
  "I believe that people have begun to form a picture of us as 
a stable party. And there can be no doubt that our voters are 
well satisfied that we are involved in government cooperation," 
Radical Liberal Folketing group chairman Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen 
said. "The fact that we have three ministers who are very 
visible and who are responsible for areas that are important to 
Radical Liberals is probably also of significance. And the fact 
that we are demonstrating our opposition to the Oresund bridge 
may also have a role to play in this context. 
  ``While I do not think that individual issues persuade 
people 
to vote for the Radical Liberals, more than 50 percent of the 
population think that the idea of that bridge is stupid,'' said 
Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen, who himself is one of the bridge's most 
determined opponents. 
  At present the Radical Liberals seem to be the only party to 
have benefited from involvement in government. The government 
looks as if it will lose a total of 16 seats. The Social 
Democrats will lose 6 compared with the last election, while 
neither the Christian People's Party nor the CD are able to 
attract enough votes to stay above the threshold for 
representation in the Folketing. 
  The Liberal Party has lost two seats since the last Gallup 
poll in April, but the party is still on course for a major 
success in comparison with the 1990 election. Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen would enter the Folketing with 49 seats behind 
him.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Bang Nielsen: "NATO Against Cut Plans"] </F>
  [Text] NATO will stand fast at its present strength and not 
undertake additional military cutbacks, according to a statement 
that NATO's defense ministers adopted at a meeting yesterday. 
This goes dead against the Danish Government's plans to reduce 
Danish military expenditures in the next defense agreement by 
around 5 percent, an amount corresponding to 750 million kroner. 
  Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup (SDP [Social Democratic 
Party]) does not see any problem with the Danish military 
cutbacks, however. "Denmark, in comparison to a number of other 
NATO countries, has cut relatively little over the past few 
years, and when we measure in defense expenditures per capita, 
Denmark is doing fine." 
  In the press release from NATO, it states that the 
organization in "an uncertain world must preserve its military 
strength and capabilities, so the alliance can fulfill its 
missions." At the same time it was emphasized that NATO's new 
peackeeping role places increased demands.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Faorese to Election"] </F>
  [Text] (Torshavn) -- There will be an early election in the 
Faeroe Islands. The Faeroese will cast their ballots in early 
July to vote 32 candidates to the Lagting. On Thursday [19 May] 
a majority in the Lagting voted to order Lagmand [prime 
minister] Marita Petersen to call an election on the 
crisis-ridden islands as soon as possible. 
  The resolution in the Lagting means that election day will 
come between 4 and 7 July. 
  Petersen thought it unfortunate that an election is being 
called now, since she would have preferred action to have been 
taken first on the the approximately 40 important bills recently 
sent to the Lagting. 
  The Faeroese ruling coalition recently lost its majority, 
which gave the opportunity for the large opposition Sambands 
Party to submit a motion that an election be held as soon as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Mariann Nordstrom report: "Iceland Stands Firm Against </F>
Norway"] 
  [Text] Reykjavik -- "Iceland cannot halt the fishing in 
the loophole [area of Barents Sea disputed by Norway and 
Russia]. It is in international waters," Icelandic Prime 
Minister David Oddsson said in an interview with AFTENPOSTEN. 
"The disagreement between Norway and Iceland should be resolved 
through negotiations, and this is a possibility to which we 
Icelanders are open. And we have informed Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland of this, and the ball is now in Norway's 
court," he said. 
  The prime minister from the conservative Independence Party 
and Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson from the Social 
Democrats disagree about many things, but on this issue they 
seem in harmony: "The conflict must be resolved in 
negotiations," the foreign minister also said. "But we cannot 
reach agreement while Norway is unilaterally calling the tune 
and tells Iceland alone that we have to get out of the 
loophole," he said. 
  Women's Alliance Althing deputy and member of the Fisheries 
Committee Anna Olafsdottir Bjornsson put it like this: "When 
fishing in Icelandic waters is restricted, we have to look at 
other possibilities, and it is therefore natural for Icelanders 
to fish in the Barents Sea. On the Icelandic side there is some 
confusion about what the rules are for the loophole and the 
protected area around Spitsbergen. Fishermen and fishing boat 
owners are asking which agreements and treaties ban Icelandic 
fishermen from going to these areas, but it is difficult to find 
any such agreements," she pointed out. "There are gaps in the 
international agreements, and these must be filled as soon as 
possible." 
  The loophole lies outside the economic zones in the Barents 
Sea, but cod stocks that are administered by coastal states 
Norway and Russia are found in it from time to time. 
  No indication is given of what sort of solution Iceland 
wants. However, there is much to indicate that the Icelanders 
will not give in until they have been granted quotas in areas 
that Norway is currently keeping closed to the Icelanders. 
  Iceland has found itself in the midst of an economic crisis 
since 1987 when cod fishing had to be restricted because of 
overfishing and a poor growth rate among each year's young. The 
cod quota has been reduced from 450,000 to 150,000 and this 
reduction has remained in force for six years. "We are the only 
European nation that bases its economic existence on fish. 
Almost 80 percent of our export income comes from fishing," 
Foreign Minister Hannibalsson said. 
  But despite continued strict quotas and despite the fact 
that 
the price of fish on the world market has, according to the 
OECD, fallen by 22 percent between January 1992 and September 
1993, last year was not as bad as many people feared. This is 
due in part to moving over to new fish types, but also to a 
large extent to what the Icelanders call "outlying seas," 
including the loophole. Total catches increased by 4 percent 
over 1992, something that in turn led to an increase in GNP of 1 
percent, according to the OECD. 
  One person who has sent trawlers to the Barents Sea is 
director Gudrun Larusdottir of the Stalskip company in 
Hafnafjordur. The refrigerator trawler Ymir has been to the 
loophole twice and will travel there again if this is the only 
way of getting hold of fish. 
  "I only go to the Barents Sea if I have to," Gudrun 
Larusdottir said. ``If I had enough fish in Icelandic waters I 
would not go to the loophole. It is distant, it is expensive, 
and fishing is unpredictable. 
  "It is unreasonable of the Norwegians to be so inflexible 
toward the Icelanders on this issue. Norwegian fishermen take 
Norway haddock on the Reykjanes Ridge outside Iceland's 200-mile 
economic zone. This is an area that the Icelanders look on as 
their loophole, a spawning ground for fish that belong to our 
fish stocks. If we are not allowed to fish in the loophole we 
will drive the Norwegian fishermen off the Reykjanes Ridge," 
Gudrun Larusdottir said. 
  "We think that we have a responsibility for the Reykjanes 
Ridge," Anna Olafsdottir Bjornsson said. "But we cannot expect 
others to respect this view if we cannot respect the views of 
others," she pointed out. 
  The Norwegian consul in Akureyri, Gunnar Ragnars, director 
of 
Iceland's biggest shipping company and fishing company, 
Utgerdarfelag Akureyringa H.F., agrees that this is a difficult 
issue for Iceland "because our behavior and attitude here are at 
odds with the guidelines we have laid down in international 
forums for the preservation of fish stocks." "The Norwegians 
and other foreigners fish on the Reykjanes Ridge, and we are not 
that happy that foreigners fish our fish that is 
quota-restricted. But we have to make sure that we speak the 
same language on all matters," he stressed. 
  "Iceland recently received a letter from the Norwegian and 
Russian prime ministers," Prime Minister Oddsson said. ``We 
have replied that we are open for discussions with the various 
sides to resolve the disagreement. 
  ``We strongly hope that we can solve the problem as soon as 
possible. It is less than pleasant to have problems with our 
best friends; it is not usual for us not to be friends with 
Norway. During the cod wars against the British Norway was very 
helpful. That is something we have not forgotten. We want to 
put an end to this disagreement,'' Prime Minister Oddsson said. 
  "There have been contacts at all levels on this issue, but 
so 
far at least no solution has been arrived at," Marius Hauge, 
deputy director at the Norwegian Fisheries Ministry, said. "We 
will have to look at how to handle future contacts with the 
Icelanders. We have noted that they want contacts; they are 
probably anxious that the whole business will get completely out 
of control," he said. 
  On the subject of Norwegian fishing on the Reykjanes Ridge, 
Hauge pointed out that the biological situation for the stocks 
of Norway haddock is fundamentally different from that of the 
cod in the Barents Sea. "The Norway haddock is chiefly an 
international stock that also wanders into the Icelandic and 
Greenland economic zones. The exploitation of this fish is to 
be discussed in international forums in the near future," Hauge 
said.

    [Editorial Report] Norway has signed two agreements with 
Russia that will help prevent oil blowouts and other industrial 
accidents. 
  The daily AFTENPOSTEN of 25 May in Norwegian on page 6 
reported that the first agreement involves a collaborative 
effort between the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Norwegian 
Academy of Technical Sciences to create safety legislation for 
new installations in the oil sector. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to the effort, and the Norwegian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs has granted 1.l million kroner to fund the 
Norwegian researchers involved in the project through 1994. 
  The second agreement involves a project for quality control 
requirements within the industry. Russia has committed 30 
manpower years to this project as well, and the Norwegian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will spend 600,000 kroner on it. 
  An agreement for a collaborative project on risk analyses of 
the nuclear plants on the Kola peninsula is also planned. 
  The agreements are in response to a request by the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and took 18 months to work out.

<F P=106> [Kaa Eneberg report: "Long Road to EU Defenses"] </F>
  [Text] "The European Union [EU] can never force a member 
of the Union to join in defense cooperation that the country's 
political leadership does not have a mandate from the people to 
join," outgoing Armed Forces Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson 
said in an address to the Foreign Policy Institute in 
Stockholm's Old Town yesterday. 
  However, within the defense forces a report is already being 
prepared for presentation in the fall of what changes to the 
Swedish defense forces will be needed in order to facilitate 
increased international cooperation. The issue has been made 
more urgent by the new cooperation arrangement, Partnership for 
Peace [PFP]. 
  Preparations are already taking place so that Sweden will 
perhaps be able to take part in the first PFP exercise. The 
supreme commander pointed out, however, that as yet no political 
decision has been reached on the matter. 
  "The investigation being carried out at headquarters aims to 
look at how Swedish forces can better engage in international 
cooperation, not only with Finland's, Norway's, and Denmark's 
defense forces, but also with the combat forces of the rest of 
Europe," Bengt Gustafsson declared. He is expecting clearer 
instructions from the government as to how the defense forces 
are to plan possible future changes in preparation for the next 
defense bill that will be agreed in 1997. 
  However, in general terms he predicted that the road to a 
common European security system and possible common European 
defenses will be a very long one and that the matter might only 
find its way onto the agenda "at some distant point in time." 
He also pointed to the alternative possibility that the issue 
might never arise because of a trend toward fragmentation in the 
Western world. At the same time he pointed to the clear efforts 
by France and also Germany to create a defense force independent 
of NATO. 
  Bengt Gustafsson, who is now leaving his post after eight 
years, had drawn a full house, as might have been expected. A 
little while ago he irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt by 
raising the old question of a Nordic defense league. This time 
he protected his back by not "saying a word" on the subject. 
  However, he did point to the joint Nordic military operation 
in Macedonia and Bosnia as an extension of cooperation that goes 
back a long way and as a political demonstration of solidarity 
with Europe. 
  Bengt Gustafsson stressed that bearing in mind the increased 
international involvement the future structure of the defense 
forces must not lead to a situation in which Sweden has two 
defense forces, one for Sweden itself and one to be lent out. 
He wants to see a single defense force, but with a clear 
delineation of roles. No one with a reason not to go abroad 
should be forced to go, and anyone who wants to go abroad must 
be given all the necessary support, said Bengt Gustafsson, who 
also wants to see the personnel question clearly addressed in 
the next defense bill.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Opinion on Hold"] </F>
  [Excerpt] At this point it is clear that the negotiations 
concluded in March between Sweden and the European Union [EU] 
did not give the proponents of membership any additional forward 
momentum. The first negotiation round, which was completed 
before the turn of the year, led to a clear yes effect in the 
opinion polls. This time, however, the opinion seems to be wait 
and see. 
  According to the most recent poll, carried out by Skop and 
published in DAGENS INDUSTRI, the no side has even been somewhat 
strengthened. To the straight question of how a person would 
vote there are in April 55 percent who say no to membership, as 
against 45 percent yes. To be sure, that is a clear improvement 
over to the situation in the fall, when the yes side was below 
40 percent, but a drop of 3 percentage points since February for 
yes. 
  But Skop also has another question that provides more room 
for the interviewed to indicate his uncertainty. To the question 
of whether we should enter the EU there were in April 34 percent 
who replied "yes, absolutely" or "yes, perhaps," while 32 
percent replied "no, probably not" or "no, absolutely not." The 
remaining 35 percent were therefore genuinely undecided. This, 
the largest group, has grown since the negotiations were 
concluded, and it is primarily among these that many today say 
they would vote no. 
  So even if the no side seems to continue to stand stronger 
than the yes side, many persons who apparently had envisioned 
voting no have become more receptive to influence. [passage

  [Excerpts] New Democracy [NYD], the noisy opposition party 
in the Swedish parliament, has dismissed its leadership of less 
than two months. The dismissed leadership does not accept the 
decision, hence there are two competing heads and two party 
boards. At this rate, NYD will drop out of parliament in this 
fall's elections, Timo Seppaenen reports. 
  [Seppaenen] Harriet Colliander is a name that will go down 
in Sweden's political history. Colliander will ensure the 
inclusion of her name in records as her country's shortest-lived 
party leader. Less than two months ago, she was elected 
chairwoman of New Democracy. Yesterday, an extraordinary party 
congress dismissed her from her post, together with the entire 
party board. During Colliander's short term of office, NYD's 
parliamentary group was entirely split. The process of firing 
the party chairwoman was started by a farce in the voting in 
parliament on subsidies for home care, in which the party group 
was split three ways. 
  Because of its internal wrangling, New Democracy has lost 
its 
excellent position in Swedish politics. The party is no longer 
able to swing the government despite its position of holding the 
balance, which it gained in the elections. [passage omitted] 
  The party chairwoman, dismissed yesterday, and the party 
board do not regard the decision by the extraordinary party 
congress as legal and will not give up their posts. The newly 
elected leaders admit that they will stay in their posts for a 
couple of weeks on a temporary basis. In that period, the 
party's 3,000 or so members will have to vote on whether they 
support the new leadership. [passage omitted] 
  There is some basis for NYD remaining in parliament. 
Vivianne 
Franzen, who has been elected new chairwoman, is a skillful 
demagogue. She is seeking votes by expressing anti-immigrant 
views, scaring the Swedes with the growing influence of Muslims. 
Franzen's chances are also boosted by the fact that she is 
supported by Ian Wachtmeister and Bert Karlsson, NYD's two 
charismatic founders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Sune Olofson: "Acute Financial Crisis in the Air </F>
Force"] 
  [Text] The Air Force has landed in an acute financial 
crisis. There is a shortfall of nearly 700 million kronor for 
this fiscal year. A contributing reason is that the JAS project 
has become 5 to 6 billion more expensive than estimated due 
solely to the lower value of the krona and the high dollar 
exchange rate. 
<H5>  Later Payment </H5>
  "We have been forced to postpone several of this year's 
materiel orders, primarily for the JAS project, to next year. We 
have also negotiated with industry, so that we can pay a little 
later," says Lieutenant Colonel Arne Heden, head of the 
coordination section of the Air Force command at the military 
headquarters in Stockholm. 
  Last winter it was the Navy that was struggling with an 
acute 
deficit of 800 million. That problem was solved by Defense 
Minister Anders Bjorck with very tough demands for savings and 
an extra supplement of 400 million kronor through the sale of 
oil from the emergency stores. 
  Now it is apparently the Air Force's turn. Air Force chief 
Lars-Erik Englund has been summoned to the Defense Committee on 
Thursday [5 May]. 
  There he will, among other things, reply to questions about 
the strained financial situation of JAS and why the costs of the 
JAS project are not accounted for in a satisfactory manner, 
something which the parliamentary JAS Committee has pointed out. 
<H5>  Worried Command </H5>
  Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson and Lars-Erik Englund 
themselves recently took up the question of the Air Force's 
runaway expenses in the military command's advisory commission, 
which also includes politicians from the Defense Committee. 
  According to what SVENSKA DAGBLADET has learned, the 
military 
command is somewhat concerned that the Defense Ministry does not 
really want to face the future seriousness of the situation. 
  Arne Heden maintains that the Air Force's problem is not 
about an acute liquidity crisis but about the space within the 
Air Force's planning framework that has shrunk due to the 
reduced value of the krona and the previously very high dollar 
exchange rate. 
<H5>  High Exchange Rate </H5>
  Approximately 30 percent of the technology of the JAS 
aircraft was bought abroad at a high exchange rate, which has 
resulted in a collapse of the financial planning calculations. 
  "I believe that we have the situation under control. We will 
hardly exceed the budget for this year. But if the krona does 
not strengthen and the dollar rate goes down, after 1994/95 we 
will have problems of financing what we have planned for," 
stresses Arne Heden. 
  He admits that the Air Force planners to some extent have 
postponed the problems in the hopes that the Swedish economy and 
the foreign exchange rates will stabilize. 
  If the high costs continue, there are really only two things 
to do: reduce operations, disband units, or allocate the Air 
Force new money. 
  The government will shortly decide about buying a 
radar-guided interceptor missile for the JAS 39 Gripen. If the 
government chooses to buy approximately 500 missiles, although a 
lower number is being discussed, the order amount will be at 
least a couple of billion kronor. 
  According to Arne Heden, the missile deal is not affected by 
the situation that has developed, "since money has already been 
allocated for missiles for the JAS."

<F P=106> [Report by Christian du Brulle: "Weapons Trafficking </F>
Discovered in Brussels] 
  [Text] Travelers' checks stolen from the Commercial Bank of 
Rwanda in Kigali totaling $10 million (340 million Belgian 
francs [BFr]) might have been used by "honest" Western 
businessmen to purchase weapons illegally for the Rwandan Army. 
  This hypothesis seems to have been confirmed by the arrests 
in Brussels by investigating Judge Patrick Mandoux. In 
addition, this clandestine network, which aimed to bypass the UN 
embargo on weapons sales in the region, allegedly is directed by 
the Rwandan Embassy in Kinshasa with the help of Zairian 
Civilian Guard officials. 
  The trafficking was discovered in Brussels on Thursday [2 
June] when employees of a Brussels bank tipped off police. Two 
clients were trying to cash traveler's checks amounting to $1.4 
million (BFr47.5 million). The bank employees became suspicious 
because the clients carried this large amount of checks in a 
travel bag. In addition, the checks had not been signed a 
second time as is usally the case. 
  The police immediately intervened. Didier, 43, a Belgian 
residing in Ohain but born in Luluabourg (Zaire), and Fred, 59, 
a U.S. citizen residing in Binza, a residential area of 
Kinshasa, were taken to Ohain by police inspectors. Documents 
describing the extent of this huge arms trafficking were seized 
during a search of Didier's house. The checks stolen in Kigali 
have been given to several teams of Western businessmen to be 
negotiated in Europe. The money is to be used for purchasing 
weapons on behalf of the provisional Rwandan Government. Fake 
documents certifying the validity of the stolen traveler's 
checks had been forged by the cabinet of the Rwandan interior 
minister. 
  Moreover, in order to bypass the UN embargo, a fake 
certificate from an official of the Zairian Civilian Guard 
stated that the weapons were negotiated on behalf of the 
Civilian Guard. In case problems were encountered, the teams 
sent to Europe were to explain that the money was intended for 
the purchase of medicines and medical equipment for the Rwandan 
refugees who had fled their country. 
  A first team of "businessmen," recruited by top members of 
the network, was caught in London a few days ago with $900,000. 
A second team was arrested with $1.4 million in Brussels on 
Thursday. Finally, a third team was discovered with stolen 
traveler's checks in Waterloo on Friday. 
  Meanwhile, the Zairian Embassy in Brussels told us that 
President Mobutu has not financed any operation aimed at 
providing weapons or ammunition to the Rwandan Government forces 
(...) Tutsis and Hutus who have acquired Zairian nationality 
are full Zairian citizens. They thus enjoy the same protection 
as any other Zairian national. This also is the case for Rwandan 
nationals of Tutsi origin who sought refuge in Zaire, Ambassador 
Kimbulu said. He denied that some Tutsi refugees who managed to 
reach Goma were executed by Rwandan soldiers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No Additional Blue Helmets To </F>
Baranja"] 
  [Text] After some hesitation about increasing the number of 
Belgian military personnel in Baranja (Croatia) by several 
dozen, the government decided on Friday [3 June] to take another 
path. For more than two years, a reinforced Belgian UN battalion 
has been stationed in Serb-occupied Baranja. In late February, 
at the height of the tension surrounding Sarajevo, one armored 
combat company, however, was assigned to go and back up the UN 
troops in Bosnia posthaste. This move meant that a large 
proportion of the protection for the Baranja detachment (BELBAT) 
was lost. After the experience in Rwanda, it was decided to 
reinforce this detachment with extra armored vehicles. On 
Friday, it was decided not to send new men or equipment there. 
The general staff were ordered by the UN senior command to 
investigate how the Belgian combat company in Bosnia could be 
reincorporated into BELBAT. Belgium is, however, temporarily 
keeping its transport and engineering company in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Article by Ben Fayot, chariman of the Socialist Workers </F>
Party: "Is the Democratic Party the Main Opposition Party?"] 
  [Text] Democratic Party [DP] circles are upset about the 
numerous attacks against the DP. They consider this a plot to 
keep the DP out of the goverment. 
  Even worse, they claim that the CSV [Christian Social 
People's Party] and LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of 
Luxembourg] have already decided to form a government again 
after the 12 June elections. 
  Everyone knows that this is a big lie. 
  In Luxembourg no coalitions are formed before the elections. 
  But accusing political opponents of this is as old as the 
elections themselves and as such does not need to be taken 
seriously. 
  We wonder why the DP is upset right now by the attacks on 
its 
program. If I were a DP strategist, I would be very delighted 
by this instead of being upset. 
  I would be glad because criticism proves that the neoliberal 
DP program has "reached" the voters and that its content and 
statements with all their social consequences are being taken 
seriously and are feared. Or would the DP suddenly be afraid of 
its own courage and shortly before the elections want to pour 
water in the neoliberal sacramental wine?

<F P=106> [Article by Johny Lahure, minister of social security, </F>
sports, and youth: "What the DP Election Program Does not 
Mention"] 
  [Text] The DP [Democratic Party] election program states 
that "the government and its administrations have to confine 
themselves to their core tasks." The DP's goal was "to cleanse 
the welfare state and to reconstruct it on a more solid 
foundation". 
  In order to achieve this, "more flexibility and a 
differentiation of jobs are needed in the job market," and "the 
entire retirement benefits system should be subjected to a 
critical analysis" and "more selectiveness must be applied in 
the area of health insurance plans as well." That means that "a 
return to real necessities and a resolute curbing of any abuse 
are absolutely essential." 
<H5>  How To Cleanse the Welfare State </H5>
  The DP has not yet answered the question of what this 
"different welfare state", this "other model of social 
solidarity" should look like. 
  Should the legal minimum wage be lowered or even completely 
abolished and the unemployment protection be reduced? 
  Will the index be called into question? Or will retirement 
benefits and pensions no longer be indexed to the price and wage 
development when the DP election program talks of "bounced 
checks"? In Parliament, the leader of the DP group has denied 
any such intentions of his party. But what else do the general 
statements of the DP platform mean? Or has the leader of the DP 
group already distanced himself from the DP election program? 
  It would be a welcome development if the DP, as the party 
"with new ideas," would tell its voters the plain truth before 
12 June. 
<H5>  Health Care Expenses </H5>
  In the paper JOURNAL, at least, the DP has given us a first 
taste of its actual intentions and begun to lift the veil. The 
health policy spokesman of the DP, who is traded as the DP 
candidate for the post of minister of health as well, examines 
the constantly rising health care expenses in a series of 
newspaper articles and suggests drastic cost-cutting measures. 
  In his view, the state and the health insurances should 
continue to pay but should beware of meddling too much in the 
health care system. After all, hospitals and physicians are the 
ones who know best what is good for patients. 
<H5>  Patients To Foot the Bill </H5>
  The DP health policy spokesman further demands: 
  -- abolition of the third payer 
  -- take-over of all small risks by patients 
  -- the introduction of a financial contribution from 
patients 
for hospital and laboratory fees 
  -- a limitation of the cost reimbursement to a maximum 
amount 
per year or even the establishment of an annual amount 
(franchise) up to which there will be no reimbursement of costs. 
  Those who wish to insure the remaining risks should rely on 
a private health insurance. 
<H5>  DP for Two-Class Medical Care </H5>
  The above-mentioned DP spokesman consequently suggests 
restoring the two-class health care and to divide patients into 
two camps: on one side those who can still afford medical 
treatment, and on the other side those who, for financial 
reasons, have to do without or are dependent on the support of 
the "welfare offices." 
  Those who will vote for the DP on 12 June will know now what 
to expect. 
  But who would vote for their own slaughter?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Internal Solidarity"] </F>
  [Text] "An adequate retirement pension is one of the basics 
of a modern welfare state," states the election program of the 
Christian Social People's Party [CSV]. One remembers that, in 
the last election campaign, i.e. in 1989, old-age pension was 
one of the main issues. Which explains why a newly formed party 
claiming greater pension fairness to be at the top of its agenda 
could win four parliamentary seats right away. 
  In the meantime a lot has changed in that field, and the 
retirement pension has received a powerful stimulus. 
  Although two parallel pension systems still exist in 
Luxemburg, a contributive and a non-contributive one, and while 
the abolition of this fundamental injustice, i.e. the division 
of a country's citizens in two classes, has to be kept in mind, 
the government that emerged from the 1989 elections has to be 
praised for taking a number of steps in the direction of 
harmonizing the two systems. In view of a further 
reconciliation of the two pension systems, for example, the 
contribution limit was raised to five times the amount of the 
minimum wage. 
  Retirement pensions have indeed been improved. There is more 
pension fairness today. The retirement benefits of the civil 
service and the private sector have structurally moved towards 
each other, in part because not all wage elements in the civil 
service were passed on to the retirees, and private 
supplementary insurances were made tax-deductible. The CSV 
wants to have these measures put into law. 
  While the act of 22 December 1989 regulated the transition 
between contributory and non-contributory pension systems, the 
Pension Improvement Act of 24 April 1990 implemented the goal 
laid out in the administration's program: to achieve more 
pension fairness and a gradual adjustment to the 
non-contributory retirement plan through structural improvements 
of the contributory retirement insurance. 
  It must be mentioned that the fiscal reform realized by the 
CSV in 1984 against much opposition created the basis for the 
pension improvement. 
  The personal minimum retirement benefit rose between 1989 
and 
1994 from 26,167 Luxemburg francs [Lf] to Lf35,847; the minimum 
widow's pension from Lf17,443 to Lf28,784. The average worker's 
pension was raised by 50.4 percent between 1987 and 1994 from 
Lf39,281 to Lf50,093; the average private employee's pension by 
50.1 percent from Lf53,258 to Lf79,957; the average pension for 
craftsmen and business people by 52 percent from Lf32,532 to 
Lf49,433; and the average farmer's pension by 49.8 percent from 
Lf25,781 to Lf38,626. In general, benefits were increased by 12 
percent. 
  Several additional examples could be cited to prove that the 
government, through the CSV impulse, has kept the promise of 
more pension fairness it had made in the 1989 government 
statement. 
  Thus the Christian-Social People's Party, upon whose 
initiative all major welfare legislation was passed, can be 
trusted when it promises in its election program that it will 
continue to adjust pensions to the wage and price development 
and that it will have retirement benefits and pensions converge 
more strongly. 
  All the more after the CSV has given its welfare policy the 
label of "Solidarity". 
  "We want more internal solidarity," states the CSV election 
program. To implement a fair pension policy is basically no 
more than real solidarity between the active portion of the 
population and those people who, for decades, have given their 
best for our country.

  [Excerpt] For the time being there will be no talk of Tamil 
refugees returning from the Netherlands to Sri Lanka. 
Negotiations on the matter with the Sri Lankan Government could 
last a long time. "The bureaucracy here works very slowly 
indeed," a well-informed source in Colombo said. "The 
authorities would prefer not to have the Tamils return. They 
feel it best that they stay abroad for a while." 
  In addition, the government in Colombo first wants to see 
how 
the agreement concluded in February between Sri Lanka and 
Switzerland works out. Both countries will cooperate in the 
return of two or three hundred Tamils. Expectations are that 
the initial asylum seekers, whose requests for asylum have been 
declined in Switzerland, will be sent back this month. The 
UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] is prepared to oversee 
the proper implementation of the agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Schwerin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, "stability criteria are more important than the 
calendar" for European currency union. Kohl said in Schwerin 
today, during German-Spanish government consultations, that the 
national economies must "reach maturity" as a precondition for 
the planned currency union of the European states. The 
"calendar" for currency union could be postponed, but cannot be 
abandoned, Kohl stressed. 
  Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez are to talk 
further today about the topic of the European currency union. 
Gonzalez pointed out that his two days of talks in Schwerin are 
his first visit to one of the new federal German states.

called for consistent continuation of the policy of European 
integration. Following German-Spanish government consultations 
in Schwerin, he said today that to a great degree, European 
integration had contributed to the prosperity and freedom of 
nations. He and his Spanish counterpart Felipe Gonzalez agreed 
to continue to press for the integration of Europe. 
  Kohl went on to say that both sides had agreed during the 
two-day summit in the Mecklenburg-Western Pomeranian capital 
that they would intensively prepare and coordinate in advance 
for the forthcoming European Union Council meeting in Corfu. 
  Against the background of the D-Day celebrations, Kohl said 
Germany has learned the lesson of history.

  [Excerpt] Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl are currently traveling to Ruegen Island 
in the Baltic Sea, where they will continue their talks. 
Gonzalez and Kohl have just given a news conference. Pedro 
Fernandez Cespedes reports from Schwerin: 
  [Cespedes] Speaking at a news conference a few minutes ago, 
Felipe Gonzalez and Helmut Kohl expressed their agreement on the 
European matters which they will take to the EU [European Union] 
Council meeting, to be chaired by the Greek presidency, to be 
held in Corfu. It appears that there is agreement on the name 
of the person to succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the 
Commission, although they did not reveal the name. They want to 
continue consulting with their EU colleagues. 
  Agreement between the two leaders was also highlighted by 
the 
Spanish prime minister, who said he feels closer to the German 
chancellor on matters relating to Europe than he does to the 
Spanish Popular Party. He also agrees that what is important is 
not the timetable for a single European currency, but economic 
stability and the stability of financial markets. [passage

and a Prime Minister on the Move"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Goodbye Jean-Luc, We Were Fond 
of You 
  A sixth poll section was devoted to the future of Jean-Luc 
Dehaene and, as the cherry on the cake, to his possible 
appointment as head of the European Commission to replace 
Jacques Delors. 
  Is such promotion really a good idea? 
  Don't know is the response of 23 percent of French-speakers 
and 24 percent of the Flemish. 
  A perfect balance (33 percent) between the north and south 
of 
the country for those who believe it would "be a good thing for 
Europe." 
  Just 19 percent of French-speakers and 24 percent of the 
Flemish believe this move by the prime minister "would be a bad 
thing for Europe." 
  And the consequences for Belgium? Eighteen percent of 
French-speakers and almost twice as many Flemish believe the 
appointment would be good for Belgium and respectively 17 
percent and 22 percent believe the contrary. 
  How should we interpret these results? 
  We could cheerfully assume that 18 percent of 
French-speakers 
and 33 percent of the Flemish believe that Belgium will be 
better defended at European level. Whereas 17 percent and 22 
percent believe the opposite. We should bear in mind, however, 
that of the respondents who answered the two questions, 75 
percent of those who said that it would be "a good thing for 
Belgium" believe that it would also be good for Europe. The 
other 25 percent see it as "a bad thing for Europe." We can 
assume that the latter are not committed supporters of the prime 
minister and that he should, in a way, "go anywhere as long as 
he goes." 
  But there is another way of reading the figures. Eighteen 
percent of French-speakers and 33 percent of the Flemish are 
delighted at the prospect of Jean-Luc Dehaene's departure. Or, 
on the contrary, 82 percent of French-speakers will regret his 
departure, as will 67 percent of the Flemish. When we said he 
was popular.

<F P=106> [Article by Eberhard Wisdorff: "Between Arguments and </F>
Emotions"] 
  [Text] The appointment of a successor to Jacques Delors, 
chief of the European Union [EU] Commission, has developed into 
a political event of the first degree. In the last few days, 
the debate on the subject of a successor has called up many 
emotions, some of them old ones. 
  The office of EU Commission chief, at the head of Europe, is 
more important today than it was 10 years ago when Delors took 
up office -- not just because the Frenchman himself has set new 
standards for European unity, but also because the Brussels 
leadership has assumed greater political significance, not least 
because this year is the first time that the European parliament 
must approve the new EU Commission chief in accordance with the 
Maastricht treaty. Notwithstanding this, activities in Brussels 
will continue to be in the limelight because the constant EU 
expansion calls for further reforms, despite the widespread 
Europe-weariness of the citizens. 
  Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, and 
Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, his Belgian counterpart, both of them Christian 
Democrats, are two serious candidates for Delors' post. 
Irishman Peter Sutherland, former EU secretary for economic 
competition issues, and a successful GATT general secretary 
linked to the Uruguay Round of talks, might also stand a chance 
as a sort of compromise. The significance of Sir Leon Brittan, 
former British secretary of state for foreign trade, lies in his 
own ambition. 
  Whoever is appointed as the new EU Commission chief, who 
would normally have to wait six months before assuming his new 
office, must be viewed in the light of numerous other personnel 
appointments, such as that of the new OECD general secretary, a 
new head of the Western European Union, a new chairman of the EU 
Council, and a chief of the new World Trade Organization. 
  What is certain is that German conduct in the question of a 
successor of Delors' has caused undue sharp tones in the debate. 
At quite an early stage, Bonn let it be known that, with 
France, it was lending its support to the Belgian Dehaene, from 
whom one expects a determined course of integration and who, 
during his country's duty presidency of the EU in the second 
half of 1993, proved himself to be a master of the art of 
reaching a compromise in talks. Lubbers, on the other hand, 
will long be negatively remembered for his hesitation during the 
Brussels candidacy, as well as for his misinformed remarks about 
Dutch problems caused by German unity. 
  What speaks in favor of Lubber's chairmanship of the EU 
Commission is that his country has never been duty president of 
the EU, apart from a six-month interim chairmanship held by the 
well-known Agriculture Commissioner Sicco Manshot; has only just 
surrendered its chairmanship of the European Monetary Union to 
Germany; and has otherwise not been given very generous 
treatment regarding the tenure of other EU posts. 
  In the last few days, Lubbers has taken the offensive and 
with reference to the old fears in the smaller EU countries, has 
stubbornly affirmed his candidacy. By supporting Dehaene, Paris 
and Bonn might be expressing their disapproval of The Hague's 
courtship of the British, who are not willing to integrate. It 
will be difficult for Bonn to escape this cul-de-sac without any 
damage.

  [Text] Luxembourg, June 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
will set up a group of experts to study slimming down 
legislation holding back private initiatives, economic 
development and job creation, German Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel announced in Luxembourg on Monday [6 June]. 
  EU finance ministers, meeting here, approved establishment 
of 
such a group, which will make proposals for simplifying EU and 
national legislation, he said. 
  German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt had sent a 
memorandum to other EU countries suggesting creation of a panel 
of experts to study deregulation. 
  But European Commission President Jacques Delors strongly 
opposed the idea at a finance ministers' meeting in Brussels on 
May 16, giving rise to a lively debate between Delors and the 
German ministers -- backed by British Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke. 
  Germany wanted the experts group to be fully independent of 
the Commission --but Delors thought that would mean entrusting 
outside experts with decision-making power. The EU finally 
decided that the experts could belong to the Commission or be 
independent, and the group will meet under Commission aegis. 
  Its first conclusions are expected some time next year.

  [Text] Schwerin (DDP/ADN) -- Germany and Spain have agreed 
on several concrete steps for expanding bilateral relations and 
European cooperation. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said 
this on Monday [6 June] evening in Schwerin, commenting on the 
results of German-Spanish consultations. 
  It was agreed at the talks between the two states' heads of 
government, Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez, that there will be 
careful preparation for and bilateral coordination of the 
meeting of the European Union [EU] council in Corfu in June. 
There should also be closer cooperation among France, Germany, 
and Spain regarding the EU presidency. 
  The representatives of the two countries' Foreign Ministries 
agreed to press for the accession of four states of Central and 
East Europe to the EU. The representatives of the Interior 
Ministries agreed, within the framework of the first government 
consultations to take place in eastern Germany, to develop and 
pursue a joint asylum and refugee policy within the EU. The 
work of the European headquarters for criminal investigation 
(Europol) should also be "pushed forward" and its activities 
extended to terrorism. 
  Apart from relations between Russia and NATO, the talks 
between Defence Minister Ruehe and his Spanish counterpart were 
dominated by Spain's entry into the Eurocorps and the 
development of a joint European military transport aircraft, the 
government spokesman said.

  [Text] The German-Spanish summit ends today with a private 
visit by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to the island of 
Ruegen. Before that, at a news conference, Chancellor Kohl and 
his Spanish counterpart summarized the results of the 11th round 
of government talks in Schwerin. The Spanish head of government 
flies home this afternoon. 
  [Correspondent J. Schlaewe] The first German-Spanish summit 
in one of the eastern German states was evidently blessed with 
very good fortune. Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez certainly 
noted complete agreement on virtually all European issues 
following their talks in Schwerin. This is particularly notable 
because Germany's [EU] presidency will be followed by the French 
and then the Spanish presidency. This provides new 
opportunities for shaping European policy. [Video cuts show 
Kohl addressing news conference with Gonzalez] 
  [Kohl] These are important goals. I need only mention 
improving Europe's position as an investment location. Many 
proposals from the white paper can be cited here: work on a 
joint foreign and security policy to preserve stability and 
peace. Another important issue here is relations with the states 
undergoing reform in Central, East, and southeastern Europe. 
  [Schlaewe] However, the accession of the countries 
undergoing 
reform is not on the agenda either tomorrow or in the immediate 
future. 
  According to Felipe Gonzalez, another important topic of 
discussion was bilateral relations. Spain wants, among other 
things, to take part in the Eurocorps, which so far has been 
reserved for Germany and France. Both heads of government hold 
the same view about the automobile industry's problem child, 
Seat, VW's subsidiary in Spain. This cooperation could be 
supported but it is ultimately up to the company to resolve the 
crisis.

rocket launchers and the 6,180 missiles belonging to them (with 
a range of 38 km) that were procured by the Bundeswehr last 
year. But the total number of systems and missiles of this 
series and other types is missing. However, the United States 
and Great Britain do not shrink from listing their considerable 
arsenals (120,331 and 32,853 units respectively). The Mars 
systems, which are jointly produced with Germany, are also 
contained. In contrast to 1992, Bonn also did not report 40 
guided AA-10 missiles from GDR [German Democratic Republic] 
arsenals this time. The Defense Ministry supports the 
mystery-mongering with the statement that "this data must not be 
conveyed to the United Nations because a relevant secrecy 
agreement does not exist." The arms register, for whose 
establishment the FRG also pressed in 1991, is to provide a 
survey of international arms arsenals and arms exports.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "German General"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal Government has nominated Major General 
Manfred Eisele, 56, for a top position with the United Nations. 
As an "assistant secretary general," he will control the 
worldwide missions of blue-helmeted peace troops from UN 
headquarters in New York. The nomination for the new leading 
position prior to the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court 
on the admissibility of out-of-area missions of the Bundeswehr 
led to controversies in Bonn between the Foreign Ministry, the 
Defense Ministry, and the Chancellor's Office. In the 
mid-1980's, Eisele, who was the commander of the Hamburg Armored 
Infantry Brigade No. 17, discredited himself with his superiors. 
TV reporters had asked recruits of his brigade what they would 
do in the so-called defense case. The general had to defend 
himself for the almost unanimous reply "clear off." When 
Minister Volker Ruehe took office in 1992, Eisele was replaced 
prematurely after no more than 12 months as the chief of the 
Military Policy Department in the Defense Ministry, because he 
was considered to be overtaxed. Since early April, he has been 
chief of the Bonn Bundeswehr Office. In Defense Ministry 
jargon, this authority has been derisively called the "soldiers' 
cemetery," because it is where officers whom the Defense 
Ministry wants to get rid of are transferred. Eisele went to New 
York last week for an interview at the United Nations. 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali must yet confirm the 
nomination for the influential post, which he wants to fill with 
a German.

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Sabine </F>
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Alexandra Foederl-Schmid in 
Rostock; date not given: "Uniform Laws Against Right-Wing 
Extremists"] 
  [Text] [Foederl-Schmid] Violent clashes took place on the 
occasion of the friendly soccer match between Austria and 
Germany a few days ago. In your opinion, what should be done 
against it? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I deplore very much that such 
friendly matches are overshadowed by such acts of violence. Of 
course, one has to take consistent action against it, as has 
also been done in Germany. This was partly done by calling in 
the Public Prosecutor's Office. Of course, it is bad that 
extreme right-wing motives also played a role in Austria. This 
makes it clear how important it is that Germany and Austria take 
joint action against this development. 
  [Foederl-Schmid] What is the joint course of action against 
right-wing extremists supposed to be like? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] It is very important that we 
cooperate with the police and judicial authorities and exchange 
information. We have to sit back and watch cross-border 
contacts developing increasingly frequently, not only with 
Austria, but also with other European neighbors. We have to pay 
even more attention to it than before. For me the German EU 
[European Union] presidency will be an opportunity to try to 
adjust the different criminal law provisions in the individual 
European member states, that is, no European criminal law, but 
the attempt to work toward a more uniform level than at present. 
  [Foederl-Schmid] Can you give an example? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] In some European member 
states, it is currently not forbidden to produce Nazi symbols or 
to print National Socialist ideas in newspapers. These products 
enter the German market. In our country this is punishable, but 
we do reach the people who produced it. They are in countries 
where production is not punishable. Here one should try to 
adjust the law among the states. 
  [Foederl-Schmid] Are the Austrian and the German judicial 
authorities already cooperating now? 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We have close contacts. Only 
a few days ago, talks among my state secretary, my Austrian 
colleagues, and experts from the Justice Ministry took place. 
The questions that have just been mentioned were also discussed 
there. 
  [Foederl-Schmid] Can Austria be an example with its law 
against right-wing extremism? For example, the Auschwitz lie 
has been punishable for a relatively long time. 
  [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We are also planning to make 
the denial of the Holocaust punishable. According to my 
assessment, the provisions in Germany and Austria are similar. 
It will certainly be good if we also follow a joint course in 
the EU and try to convince others of it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Good President"] </F>
  [Text] Everything could have been so fine. First a 
Bundeswehr music corps will solemnly play Ludwig van Beethoven's 
"Opferlied" before Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen welcomes the 
invited guests. 
  And then: the speech. 
  Roman Herzog, the newly elected federal president, wanted to 
show the Germans who their new head of state is on 20 July. 
With an outstanding speech at the Berlin German Resistance 
Memorial, the constitutional law expert was hoping to present 
himself as a worthy successor to Richard von Weizsaecker. The 
appropriate setting: The central commemorative event for the 
Hitler attackers of 20 July 1944. 
  The ideal first appearance he had dreamt of, the "first 
major 
test" (Herzog), has become a pitiful false start. Somebody else 
will speak instead of Herzog: Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman said: "It is the 
50th anniversary, and I would like to do it myself this time." 
Period. Herzog gave in. He does not want to strain the 
commemorative day with a "row over prestige" and so he submitted 
to the inevitable. On "second thought," he has realized that he 
made a "mistake:" "I had not given it enough thought." 
  After the unlucky term of the "easygoing" nation he used on 
the day he was elected, this has now been his second blunder. 
In modest defiance, Herzog said that he had now "decided" to 
invite those who participated in the aborted attack against 
Hitler, and their descendants, to Bellevue Palace. Can he live 
with the impression that he is a president by the grace of Kohl? 
"Yes, in the first three weeks of my term I can." 
  Herzog knows to whom he owes his high office. Now his patron 
has made him painfully aware of who has the say in the state: 
not he who is the first man in the state according to protocol, 
but Kohl himself, the third man. 
  The chancellor did not even think it necessary to react to 
Herzog's intention, which he voiced in public -- he simply let 
Herzog run his head into a wall. 
  "Herzog did not even mention this desire in our office," one 
aide from the Chancellor's Office said hypocritically. This is 
how the great ruler likes it: Any wishes, and even those of the 
future president, have to be reported to him, particularly when 
there is an election campaign going on. 
  Moreover, Kohl seems to be worrying greatly that, through 
meaningful speeches on the occasion of historic days, this 
federal president might also acquire excessive respect and 
become an example to the citizens. Ten years of Richard von 
Weizsaecker have taught him enough. 
  Weizsaecker talked himself into the Germans' hearts on 8 May 
1985: In an internationally acclaimed address on the 40th 
anniversary of the capitulation, which also meant liberation, in 
which Weizsaecker bowed in the Bundestag to all victims of 
fascism, expressing his respect to all resistance fighters 
without exception. Pressed on vinyl, the speech became a 
bestselling record and Weizsaecker became the chancellor's 
private enemy. Kohl suffered because he could not come anywhere 
near to speaking as eloquently as Weizsaecker. 
  Kohl was foresighted and took precautions that the future 
president would not disturb his parade on 20 July. As early as 
October -- when Saxon Steffen Heitmann was still his favorite 
candidate -- the chancellor told the organizers who would hold 
the speech at the commemorative event at the Bendlerblock on 
Stauffenberg Street. 
  "He indicated that he would like to do it," Dieter Thomas, 
member of the board of directors of the 20 July Relief 
Foundation, said. Everything was clear to Thomas: "Nobody can 
say no if the chancellor wants something." 
  In February, the 18 members of the preparatory committee for 
the commemorative day met in the Senat building in Berlin. 
There were representatives of three resistance organizations, 
the Federal Government, the memorial in Stauffenbergstrasse, and 
of the Senate. 
  The proposal that Chancellor Kohl should deliver a speech as 
he did 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40th anniversary, was 
accepted without any discussion. "There were not the slightest 
signs of opposition," Volker Kaehne, head of the Senat office, 
said. 
  The chance to adequately face the victims of Nazi terrorism 
and their descendants at this anniversary, was forfeited -- 
because it did not occur to anyone to contradict the chancellor. 
Anybody could anticipate that, in the middle of the election 
campaign, it would have been more suitable for the federal 
president, who is nonpartisan by the very nature of his office, 
to head the celebrations on the commemorative day, rather than 
the CDU chairman. 
  This means making 20 July "an incredibly political date," 
Peter Steinbach, head of the Berlin memorial, complained. 
  After Kohl's solitary decision, the Social Democratic Party 
of Germany [SPD] also realized that it had left the chancellor 
an excellent opportunity to present himself in a solemn way. 
Fully tied up with the search for a profile of its own and a 
program, Rudolf Scharping's team missed the importance of the 
50th anniversary, the first major historic commemorative day in 
united Germany. 
  Bernd Faulenbach, head of the SPD Executive Committee's 
History Commission, admits that "this issue was probably not 
given the necessary importance." In March, the SPD Presidium 
approved the concept for the celebrations, including the speaker. 
  Now the SPD chairman has voiced his criticism, in the same 
unfortunate way that he did after his party friend, Johannes 
Rau, failed to become federal president. Scharping complained 
that he would have regarded it as appropriate "if the chairman 
of a party that particularly suffered under the dictatorship of 
the Third Reich would have been asked to participate in the 
central commemorative celebration." 
  This idea came rather late. Friedrich Bohl (CDU), head of 
the Chancellor's Office, assures that, officially, the SPD had 
not even asked to be put on the list of speakers. 
  Now even the Greens have presented the ideal person to speak 
at the commemorative celebrations -- an election campaign is an 
election campaign. It was suggested that Jens Reich, GDR civil 
rights activist and presidential candidate, address the central 
commemorative event. 
  A federal president -- even if only just elected -- who 
knows 
his job, could have given the event commemorating the resistance 
against the Nazis the right direction and setting. Yet, now 
narrow-minded people and busybodies have taken possession of 
this day. 
  All of a sudden, a longstanding controversy has flared up 
over exhibits on show in the German Resistance Memorial. The 
son of Hitler's attacker, Claus Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg, 
Franz Ludwig, has criticized the involvement of the "Free 
Germany National Committee," which, under communist guidance, 
recruited resistance fighters against Hitler in the Soviet 
prisoner-of-war camp Krasnogorsk. 
  The head of the memorial has threatened to resign if 
exhibits 
were indeed removed. Steinbach: "Resistance is indivisible." 
  In defiance of Steinbach, the Berlin celebrations are to be 
fashioned as a traditional opportunity for the military -- 
because Stauffenberg and many of his coconspirators were 
nationalist German officers. The Bundeswehr will provide an 
honorary formation. 
  For the chancellor it will be perfect. For him, 20 July will 
fit into a series of appearances with publicity appeal and a 
military background. 
  On 31 August, he is planning to walk through the Brandenburg 
Gate together with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. On 8 
September, he will celebrate the withdrawal of the allied forces 
in a pompous act in Berlin. 
  This is more than ample compensation for the head of the 
German Government for not having been permitted to participate 
in the D-Day celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the allied 
invasion in Normandy, which he would have wanted so much. 
  Now there would still be time enough for Herzog to show the 
chancellor who is the first man in the state: A clarifying word 
with the chancellor should not be so difficult for the head of 
state. Yet Weizsaecker's successor has not exchanged a single 
word with the chancellor since the day after his election. He 
has already set his mind on his next test. 
  On 8 May 1995 it will be 50 years since World War II ended. 
Who will speak on that day? Roman Herzog believes that it will 
be the president. Herzog has already told the public that he 
would hold his speech "with unrelenting truth and frank words." 
  This man has learned quickly from the chancellor.

<F P=106> ["dr"-signed report: "The Chancellor Will Tolerate No One </F>
But Himself at Remembrance Anniversary"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- In the run-up to his election as federal 
president, Roman Herzog made a point of noting the date of the 
anniversary of the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler. 
Speaking to SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, he described the first major 
speech that he would deliver after taking office --the speech 
scheduled for the 50th anniversary of 20 July -- as a test. 
  The federal president has been spared the test. The 
chancellor has decided to step in. He wants to give the speech 
himself and has attracted disapproval from the SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] and resistance associations. SPD's 
Rudolf Scharping -- it is being said that he himself would have 
liked to have delivered a speech on the anniversary -- explained 
yesterday that "it is impermissible for anyone to use the 
anniversary for election campaign purposes." He thinks it would 
have been appropriate if the chairman of a party that 
particularly suffered under the dictatorship of the Third Reich 
had been invited to take part in the event. Scharping now wants 
to express his views on the occasion "in an appropriate manner." 
The Federal Chancellery did not want to comment on the 
criticism. 
  That Kohl should dominate the proceedings is something that 
resistance associations themselves do not want. Speaking to 
TAGESZEITUNG, Claritta von Trotz zu Solz, the widow of 
resistance fighter Adam von Trotz zu Solz who was executed in 
1944, said: "I am very sad that a speech delivered by a man who 
stands for one particular political current will fail to reflect 
the diversity of the resistance, especially here in Kreisau 
District." 
  Peter Steinbach, the director of German Resistance 
Monuments, 
has distanced himself from plans for the commemoration to date. 
He does not agree with the military ritual and would have 
preferred to have a civilian event, but failed to get his 
arguments accepted. The Federal Defense Ministry has planned a 
march by a guards battalion and a column of soldiers. 
  Annemarie Renger, the former Bundestag speaker and chairman 
of the Central Association of Resistance and Persecuted Persons 
Organizations, has called for the main speech to be delivered by 
the president. However, the chancellery of future Federal 
President Roman Herzog states that it is aware of no such plans.

<F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Roman Herzog by Branka </F>
Trivic in Karlsruhe on 21 May: "The Nation Is Something Else, 
Though"] 
  [Text] The election of the German president cost the 
taxpayers in Germany 2.5 million German marks (per diem 
payments, travel expenses, accommodation etc.), but in spite of 
that German citizens did not get the president they wanted: Mr. 
Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic Party candidate. According 
to the latest opinion poll carried out by DER SPIEGEL magazine, 
Rau was supported by 54 percent of poll repondents, and Herzog 
by only 20 percent. 
  This was the price paid for the indirect presidential 
election, sanctioned by the German Basic Law of 1949. This 
solution was chosen because of the negative experience with the 
Weimar Republic, when Paul von Hindenburg, who was elected 
president by a plebiscite, made use of his right and appointed 
Adolf Hitler chancellor, thus legalizing the rise of National 
Socialism. Anxious because of this experience, the authors of 
the present constitution decided that all future presidents be 
elected by the indirect method. On behalf of the German 
population of 80-million, the German president was elected by 
1324 delegates on 23 May 1994. Half of them were Bundestag 
members, and the other half were delegates from the 16 regional 
parliaments and independent representatives from public and 
cultural life. 
  Roman Herzog, the 60-year-old president of the Federal 
Constitutional Court, was elected by simple majority after a 
seven-hour voting procedure, since he failed to achieve the 
absolute majority in the first two election rounds. He obtained 
696 votes, which was more than his rival Johannes Rau, who 
obtained 605 votes. It was necessary that he obtain at least 
eight votes more than 663 in order not to depend on the votes by 
rightist radical party members (Republican Party). The new 
German president won the election owing to the liberal party 
(FDP [Free Democratic Party]), which, as it was predicted, 
decided to support the Christian Democrat candidate in the third 
election round, thus confirming its decision to remain in the 
ruling coalition. The interview with the first president of the 
united Germany was held in Karlsruhe, two days before the 
election meeting [21 May 1994]. Roman Herzog was relaxed and 
said with self-irony that he would have to write a speech the 
following day just in case the worse thing happened -- if he was 
elected president. Taking "this worst possibility" as probable 
we asked Mr. Herzog the first question. 
  [Trivic] How does a man who will replace the already 
legendary Richard von Weizsaecker feel? 
  [Herzog] I have to tell you that it is exceptionally 
difficult to replace such a personality as Mr. Richard von 
Weizsaecker. It is hard to believe than anyone could be as 
successful as Mr. von Weizsaecker, let alone be better. For 
this reason, it is a big challenge, too. I cooperated with Mr. 
von Weizsaecker for a long time and I can say that there will be 
no significant differences between us, as far as both domestic 
and foreign affairs are concerned. There will be no change in 
this respect. 
<H5>  The Term of Office of the "Republicanized Monarch" </H5>
  [Trivic] What will be the main tasks of the new president? 
  [Herzog] He has to contribute to the new political 
constellation in Europe and in the world, which we have had for 
several years already. Germany, and not only Germany, but the 
whole of Europe has not yet processed the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the Warsaw bloc. Until several years ago everybody 
thought in terms of two political blocs, in terms of a ping-pong 
play between these two blocs, these two hemispheres. Now, we 
must establish direct contacts with the newly established 
countries in Central and East Europe. This requires from us in 
Germany to develop a new foreign policy culture. The president 
will have to make a considerable contribution to these issues. 
One of the main functions of the president will be to make 
centrifugal forces, which traditionally belong to a pluralistic 
and democratic society, less powerful than centripetal. The 
Bundestag should remain the center of various social and 
political interests, but at the same time there must be 
organizations and institutions which will enable a minimum of 
unity. These institutions are the president of the republic and 
the Constitutional Court. 
  The president has had more responsibility since Germany 
became united; he has had to influence the feeling of solidarity 
in western Germany because the eastern part of the country has 
to develop. The president must explain to the citizens in the 
western part that it was only historical circumstances which 
affected the development of the eastern part of Germany, for 
which reason they need help now. We should not treat them as a 
burden, which happens sometimes. 
  [Trivic] The powers of the German president are not large. 
  [Herzog] This is true. If we wanted to broaden them, the 
constitution should be changed. 
  [Trivic] Do you think that the indirect election method is 
democratic enough? 
  [Herzog] If you want a powerful presidential function, as is 
the case in the United States or in France, for example, the 
president should be elected according to the direct electoral 
method. If you, on the other hand, want a weak presidential 
function, as is the case in Germany, there is no reason why he 
should not be elected indirectly. The Italian or German 
president is something like a "republicanized monarch," with a 
limited term of office, of course. 
<H5>  Adenauer's Children's Loyalty </H5>
  [Trivic] Some European countries are afraid of the new, 
united Germany. Are these fears irrational? 
  [Herzog] Yes, this can be heard very often, but I have heard 
other things, too, such as expectations from East and Central 
Europe -- which are, admittedly, expressed with much caution -- 
that Germany should solve all their problems. There is a 
tendency in East European countries to become closer to Germany, 
even to the extent that they give the impression of an area of 
German hegemony. One of the German foreign policy tasks has been 
and will be to avoid such a development. It must be pointed out 
that Germany alone cannot finance the reconstruction of Central 
and East Europe, because it has its own eastern part. It is 
only natural that help must be offered to East Europe, but this 
must be done on the European level. England and France, West 
Europe in general, must create a bridge toward Central and East 
Europe in order to support economic reforms and growth. Germany 
must not express any hegemonistic tendencies toward this area; 
what is more, it must not allow such an impression to be created 
anywhere, because this would spoil the relations Germany has 
been creating in Europe for over 40 years. We must always 
remember that relations between Germany and France have been 
normal for only 40 years now, and that it is a real wonder of 
this century that the almost archetypal animosity between these 
two countries was overcome. This must not be put at stake. I 
believe in the future Germany integrated into Europe. If this 
has functioned for the past 40 years, why should it not function 
also in the future? 
  [Trivic] There are people who claim, however, that Helmut 
Kohl is the last German chancellor of European orientation, that 
all of his followers will choose a strictly national platform. 
What do you think about this? 
  [Herzog] I do not agree with such statements. Adenauer's 
children and grandchildren remained loyal to his political 
vision. I think that also his great-grandchildren will persevere 
on that road. Adenauer's ideas have to be repeated and proven 
again and again, though. 
  [Trivic] Many people warn of an increasingly stronger 
neo-Nazi movement and rightist extremism. 
  [Herzog] This requires a very careful analysis. 
Representatives of rightist extremism, predominantly Nazis of 
old attitudes, were excluded from the public political scene a 
long time ago. In the meantime new generations have appeared. 
After half a century the taboo against National Socialism and 
its stigmatization have weakened so that there are certain 
groups of young people with such ideas, who have now appeared on 
the political scene. They make public appearances and this 
creates the impression that they are very powerful. I think, 
however, that this is only the matter of an improved acoustics, 
if I may say so. I do not agree with the statement that this is 
a significant shift of political powers in Germany toward the 
political right. The problem lies in several "dreamers" who 
would like to return Germany to Bismarck's politics. As far as 
criminals and terrorists who kill people, burn houses, and 
attack asylum-seekers are concerned, we have to be merciless; 
all means allowed in a constitutional state must be applied. 
  [Trivic] You once said that the opinion that all Germans are 
of the same blood is a historical error. How do you define the 
German nation? 
  [Herzog] It is an old question how to define a nation. 
There is one nation in Europe which has had the fewest problems 
with this issue -- the French. They had first created their 
state so that their nation could develop within its borders. 
The German national consciousness was created as late as in 
early 19th century. A German state had not existed at that 
time. A nation is naturally defined by the element of a common 
language, but Switzerland is proof that this criterion does not 
have to be fulfilled. There are elements of common history and 
tradition, but Germany is proof that neither these elements have 
to be fulfilled. Beginning with the Reformation, the German 
population proved its nationality through mutual wars. A common 
origin as an element of the nation cannot be overvalued, either. 
If you look at the roots of all Germanic peoples, you will see 
that one third of them are "germanized" Celts, and that one 
fourth, and perhaps more, have Slavic roots. The feeling that 
you belong to one nation does not necessarily have something to 
do with the same origin and the same blood. I am really not 
fond of these criteria. It is neither true that all members of 
a nation must have the same mental characteristics. There is the 
prejudice in Germany, too, that all German people have to think 
and feel in the same way, which is absurd since they have never 
been equalized. Different geographic origins which enable 
different influences have, for example, determined that a German 
from the province of North Rhine-Westphalia is influenced by 
France, someone from Hamburg by Scandinavia and England, and a 
Bavarian by Italy, Austria, and the European East. This has 
caused many difficulties throughout history, but I see these 
differences as a big chance. 
  The things which are now going on in Central and 
southeastern Europe, the discovery of major problems, such as 
"Who am I and where do I come from?" etc., and the fall into 
categories inappropriate to our time sound really threatening 
after having known the tradition of internationalism for several 
decades. It is difficult to speak about the notion of state 
sovereignty in a classical way in a modern, integrated, and 
interdependent world. That is why I think that it will take a 
long time to solve these problems. 
<H5>  Living With a "Surplus of Sensitivity" </H5>
  [Trivic] Do you think that Germany, because of its neo-Nazi 
and extremist groups, makes a worse impression abroad than 
France, for example, although there are nationalist and 
extremist provocations there, too? 
  [Herzog] This is understandable. The horror caused by the 
Nazi regime cannot be forgotten within one generation only. I 
have much understanding for the bad impression Germany makes 
abroad, but I think that these things will be sorted out, too. 
When there are provocations by rightist extremists in France, 
they are not connected to the Holocaust of 6 million Jews. We 
have to live with our past, although our children have no 
responsibility for it. I was 11 at the end of war. My children 
cannot be blamed for something which happened 50 years ago, but 
the German people have to learn how to live with this "surplus 
of sensitivity" toward them. This is perhaps good for our own 
"political hygiene." It can always be claimed that the Nazi 
catastrophe could have happened in some other country, too, but 
there is a significant difference -- this happened to us, and 
not to somebody else. 
  [Trivic] How would you comment on the Balkan crisis and the 
role of Germany there? 
  [Herzog] Unfortunately, I still cannot see a reasonable 
solution to the Balkan crisis. I think that a joint NATO and UN 
military intervention would only make things worse. 
  I would not like to see German troops in the Balkans because 
of the negative historical mortgage we have in that area. As 
far as the position of Germany within NATO and its role in the 
Balkan crisis are concerned, this is a very contradictory issue. 
On the one hand, there is understanding for German restraint 
from participation in an intervention, but Germany is, on the 
other hand, reproached for not fulfilling its obligations like 
other NATO members must fulfill them. It is even reproached for 
enjoying certain privileges. I hope that a political solution 
will be found, although the fact that it has not been found yet 
casts a shadow on that hope.

<F P=106> ["eli"-attributed report: "Separation of Office and Mandate </F>
Annoys Party Leadership; Kinkel: Not Surrendered to the Union 
Unconditionally"] 
  [Text] Rostock -- The delegates of the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] congress have agreed -- even though with 
a few contortions -- to the course of their Chairman Klaus 
Kinkel and, following the coalition statement, they have 
approved the election program of the liberals. Some resistance 
against the party leadership emerged, however, when the majority 
voted for a separation of office and mandate and demanded the 
abolition of church tax. Kinkel once again justified the course 
set down in his speech on Friday [3 June] and stressed that the 
FDP has not surrendered unconditionally to the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] with the 
coalition statement. He was supported by Bundestag Group 
Chairman Hermann Otto Solms, while the left wing refrained from 
commenting. 
  On Saturday, Kinkel reacted to the criticism of his speech 
at 
the party congress and stressed that, despite the coalition 
statement, the liberals want to pursue an independent election 
campaign. The party has its own profile, he said. The chairman 
avoided answering the question of whether the FDP would also 
form a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] after the Bundestag elections if there were no other 
possibility. However, a coalition with any democratic party 
cannot be ruled out, he added. Bundestag Group Chairman Solms 
supported Kinkel's statements and warned against a red-green 
coalition and the SPD economic program. However, it was striking 
that former Chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher and North 
Rhine-Westphalian Land Chairman Juergen Moellemann did not 
comment on the statements made by the party leaders. During the 
discussion, some delegates objected: Elke Wollenschlaeger from 
Regensburg said that the FDP is not the "reserve group for 
Oggersheim." Schleswig-Holstein Land Chairman Juergen Koppelin 
admonished that the FDP is a liberal party first and a coalition 
partner only afterwards. Executive Committee Member Guido 
Westerwelle stressed that it must not be considered high treason 
if the FDP criticizes the CDU/CSU. 
  Above all, the delegates assessed the decision about 
separating office and mandate as a decision aimed against the 
party leadership. The majority of the congress decided that, as 
of the next legislative period, no Bundestag deputy may hold a 
government office. Thus, the work of the group could be 
strengthened. Genscher, who did not make any other statement, 
pleaded with the delegates to reject the motion. During his 
term as foreign minister he urgently needed the mandate to 
strengthen his position and also to take the floor outside his 
government office. Kinkel did not comment on the motion before 
the plenum, which was primarily supported by his 
Baden-Wuerttemberg Land association. However, he used harsh 
words against the separation in a working group and subsequently 
advised moving the decision to "a lower level." 
  On the weekend, the party congress deliberated primarily the 
election program with the focal issues of domestic and legal 
policy as well as economics. In a "Rostock Statement" the 
liberals condemned "with determination the xenophobia and 
violence against foreigners and Jewish institutions." The 
attacks must finally come to an end. It is the liberals' very 
own task to struggle against xenophobia. In foreigners' policy 
the FDP clearly distanced itself from the line of the coalition 
partner. Thus, foreigners, who have lived in the FRG for eight 
years are to be allowed to vote in local elections, and an 
immigration law with fixed quotas is to be established. In 
addition, the FDP demands dual citizenship and the possibility 
of acquiring citizenship by being born in Germany. In social 
policy the great number of social services are to be replaced 
with a so-called citizens' money. 
  The so-called Great Bugging Campaign, that is, permission to 
monitor conversations in apartments, was not supported in 
Rostock. A corresponding motion was already rejected by the 
working group and was not discussed in the plenum at all. In 
its drug policy, the FDP comes out against legalizing the 
possession of small amounts of drugs for a person's own 
consumption. Nevertheless, the drug policy so far has failed, 
it was said. Therefore, drugs for treatment or for withdrawal 
must be handed out under controlled conditions. Great excitement 
was caused by the decision to abolish the church tax. The 
majority of the delegates suggested replacing it with a system 
of contributions organized by the churches themselves. Regarding 
the duration of military service, the FDP is in favor of a 
reduction to clearly under 12 months.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by </F>
Bernhard Blohm and Romanus Otte in Berlin; date not given: "Tax 
Reduction Is the Most Important Task of Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] [WELT AM SONNTAG] Must the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] show a greater difference to the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] in economic policy? 
  [Rexrodt] Yes. In the CDU there are strong movements that 
urge restraint. Many people there still think as they did in 
the 1970's and 1980's. Scharping's Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] is not at all able to break up old structures. 
This year the revolutionary approach comes from the 
conservative camp, and in the coalition the liberals are the 
catalyst. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where can one see the revolutionary 
approach of the liberals? 
  [Rexrodt] The reforms in the social field must be credited 
to the FDP. The monopoly of the Federal Employment Office for 
labor exchange has been abolished. I did that. We are making 
sure that in the future the laender and communities examine 
whether activities cannot be better accomplished by private 
institutions. We have made planning and investments in housing 
construction easier. We have struggled for the amendment to the 
genetic engineering law and for the railroad reform. In the 
postreform era it is we who are pushing -- against the 
visionless alliance of the SPD in the laender and the trade 
union functionaries. We are also the ones who maintain the 
pressure: We must not limit those who perform most by means of 
a plundering tax system and excessive regulations. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Nevertheless, the bureaucracy is becoming 
denser and denser and taxes have never been as high as they are 
now. 
  [Rexrodt] The fact that the taxes are so high is due to the 
costs of reunification. But the liberals are those who say 
today that the government's June tax plan must declare that the 
solidarity surcharge will be abolished. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] The CDU rejects this. Is this an 
important topic for you with a view to a new coalition. 
  [Rexrodt] Lower taxes are the priority issue for me. They 
are the main thrust of what must be accomplished in economic and 
financial policy. A tax reduction must be implemented. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] When? 
  [Rexrodt] In 1996 or 1997. Then the taxes must be reduced. 
Thus, we must reduce the solidarity surcharge before that. We 
must make use of any freedom to reduce taxes as quickly as 
possible. I do not say this as a fashionable demand before the 
elections. I am firmly convinced of it. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] What are the other basic issues that the 
tax plan should also encompass? 
  [Rexrodt] Trade capital tax and property tax for companies 
must be abolished in 1996. Trade income tax must be reduced. 
Our state is ailing from excessive taxes. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] This ailment has reasons: The state has 
never before had such high revenues, it represents more than 
half of the GNP. Is Germany still a market economy? 
  [Rexrodt] This is a justified question. However, I ask tell 
in fairness: German unification was and still is a titanic 
task. Nevertheless, we must not get used to this state quota. 
It must be reduced. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where should the state save money? 
  [Rexrodt] In the next legislative period we must make 
further corrections in the social services. I am for preserving 
the social state. However, there are individual developments 
that are unacceptable. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Which ones? 
  [Rexrodt] I am in favor of strengthening individual 
responsibility again. If the greedy mentality continues -- I am 
not thinking only of accusations in connection with artificial 
heart valves [doctors have been accused of taking bribes from 
pharmaceutical companies] -- our social net will be strained to 
the breaking point soon. The result: It will be ruined. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] You wanted to abolish the discount law. 
Now it is just being restructured. 
  [Rexrodt] Article 1 of the new law says that the discount 
law will be abolished. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Instead, there are new restrictions. 
  [Rexrodt] For a developed society it should be a matter of 
course that discounts are freely negotiable. However, some 
business sectors are pursuing a bitter defense battle. I can 
live with the compromise. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] The law will come before the elections? 
  [Rexrodt] Before the elections. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] You did not manage this with the shopping 
hours law. 
  [Rexrodt] Abolishing the law on shopping hours was never a 
fixed goal for this legislative period but only an additional 
wish of mine. Then businesses began to attack this plan. In 
the next legislative period we will see. Something must be done 
about the shopping hours. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] This is what Ludwig Erhard said, too, in 
his time. 
  [Rexrodt] But we will accomplish it. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] A compromise on the discount law, the law 
on shopping hours postponed -- who is hindering liberal reforms? 
  [Rexrodt] These are functionaries of associations who want 
to show their reason for existence by doing that. Their choice 
of words concerning shopping hours and the discount law is no 
longer acceptable. I have never seen such aggressive attacks by 
lobbyists and clumsy references to the election behavior of 
retail businessmen. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Let us come to Eko Stahl. Did you rely 
on the wrong company when you relied on the Italian Riva 
corporation? 
  [Rexrodt] No, there was no alternative. The Trust Agency's 
choice was made under the precondition that an integrated steel 
mill is to be built in Eisenhuettenstadt. The Thyssen plan did 
not include this; the Hamburg Steel Mills plans were dubious for 
other reasons. However, today we would do a few things 
differently regarding the situation at Eko Stahl. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Like what? 
  [Rexrodt] Before an investor takeover, the personnel 
situation would be settled better. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] What is going to happen now? 
  [Rexrodt] We are working on finding a prospect for Eko Stahl 
that leads to an integrated steel mill. There are signs that 
this is not completely unlikely. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where do they come from? 
  [Rexrodt] Thyssen is willing to hold talks on cooperation. 
If it is possible to find an international consortium, there is 
the chance that a new technology can be established in 
Eisenhuettenstadt. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Can such a consortium fulfill the 
conditions posed by Brussels? 
  [Rexrodt] At the moment I do not think so. This is the big 
problem. We have to hold new negotiations in Brussels. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] The recession seems to be overcome. What 
do you want to do so that the labor market benefits from it? 
  [Rexrodt] We must continue flexibilization also if the 
economic development eases the strain. The danger is that then 
the need will abate and resistance will grow. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Which goal are you striving for? 
  [Rexrodt] We need a completely new world of work. People 
must be able to choose more freely whether they want to work 20, 
30, 40, or 50 hours per week. They should also be able to 
distribute their annual work time and their life work time more 
freely. This may mean that, on average, less is worked but by 
far more people than today. Many would also work more. Of 
course, the details are the problems -- from operational 
processes to social insurance. But we must ask the classical 
question about full employment in a new way. We need more 
creativity and more courage in politics and in the companies. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] And we need new jobs. Where are they 
supposed to develop? 
  [Rexrodt] In the families, for instance. Today paid work in 
a household is mainly done by moonlighting. We must turn these 
jobs into proper jobs by making the expenditures for them 
deductible from taxes. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where else could jobs be created? 
  [Rexrodt] The demand is enormous. Just think of nursing, 
care, supervision, and simple work, such as in trade. I do not 
want the American system, but some elements are good. It is 
nice if you get the goods that you buy delivered. Now I already 
hear the SPD: Rexrodt wants the unemployed to carry bags. Why 
not, if useful services create jobs and make our lives more 
pleasant? This is only one piece of a mosaic. And with 
everything I said I quickly get 1 million jobs. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] How do you want to win the chancellor for 
privatizing the savings banks? 
  [Rexrodt] This is probably not feasible. The chancellor and 
his friend, Horst Koehler (the president of the savings banks -- 
the editor), are against that. But we need not start with the 
savings banks. What I want is to overcome this mentality in the 
communities, where everywhere the same small circle of people 
sit together in the political bodies and public companies and 
confirm to each other that privatization is not feasible. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] You complain about the tangle? 
  [Rexrodt] I would never use this term, but we must break up 
what others call tangle. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] The privatization of waste disposal 
benefits primarily large corporations. 
  [Rexrodt] I watch the development in the waste sector with 
great concern. It is impossible that those who issue orders are 
identical to those who get the orders in the long run, or that 
large electricity companies also have the say in waste disposal. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] What can you do? 
  [Rexrodt] Just wait. I am clearly showing the instruments 
of torture. This means the antitrust law. The Antitrust Office 
is extremely vigilant. Now we must show the yellow card. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Was it your idea to call the FDP the 
"party of high-wage earners?" 
  [Rexrodt] No. But you must see this in connection with the 
discrimination of high-wage earners by Mr. Scharping, who 
includes even people who earn average wages in this category. 
We want to express our solidarity with those who perform most. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Has the quarrel hurt the FDP? 
  [Rexrodt] The zig-zag course was not fortunate. But the 
discussion has shown where we stand. This is the main thing. 
  [WELT AM SONNTAG] Will this help the FDP to cross the 
5-percent threshold in October? 
  [Rexrodt] I am convinced that the FDP will achieve a good 
result. This begins at 7 percent. We will be clearly above 
that. You mark my words.

  [Text] Bonn [no date as received] (DDP/ADN) -- Finance 
Minister Theo Waigel welcomes the rescheduling of Russia's debts 
as agreed by the Paris Club creditor countries this past 
weekend. Waigel said in Bonn on Monday [6 June] that the 
rescheduling had gained Russia "more breathing space" for its 
debts of more than $7 billion, which would otherwise have had to 
be paid this year. The extension of the deadline on payment on 
the debt would above all relieve the Russian state budget. Its 
stabilization was the main component of the reform program. 
  Waigel also stressed that, as the biggest creditor with $2.7 
million or 4.5 billion marks, Germany was once again making the 
greatest contribution. Relevant provisions have been made in 
the 1994 German federal budget and in the draft budget for 1995. 
Waigel now called upon Russia to conclude the planned 
rescheduling with the commercial banks. A satisfactory solution 
also had to be found soon for debts owed to German exporters 
without federal guarantees.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- Unemployment in Germany went 
down sharply in May. In western Germany, the number of 
unemployed fell by 84,400 to 2,505,900. In eastern Germany, the 
number of unemployed fell by 56,700 to 1,159,500. Bernhard 
Jagoda, president of the Federal Labor Office, said in Nuremberg 
today that the unemployment rate, based on all persons engaged 
in civilian employment, fell by 0.8 percent to 15.4 percent in 
eastern Germany and by 0.3 to 8.1 percent in western Germany. 
  Jagoda said that "the negative effects of the recession are 
gradually weakening" in western Germany, while demand for 
manpower in eastern Germany is reviving.

<F P=106> [Report by Jochen Thies: "Clinton, You Go First"] </F>
  [Text] West European governments were reluctant to clarify 
their relationship with the new Italian Government under Silvio 
Berlusconi. They let the United States make the first move. 
Thus, as a prelude to his European trip, Bill Clinton has had 
the opportunity to say a few words on the Rome government's 
democratic ability, and on his cooperation with it. Clinton's 
uninhibited way of dealing with Berlusconi, Fini, and other 
members of the tripartite coalition must have been noticed in 
France, Greece, and the EU [European Union] staff in Brussels, 
where, remarkably enough, opposition had been expressed 
vis-a-vis the political changes in Italy that led to a 
completely new Italian party landscape. 
  Clinton, notably younger than the leaders of Europe, and 
with 
a much fresher style, must possess a special interest in the new 
"Italian relationships" just like his predecessors after World 
War II. At that time, Washington feared a communist takeover in 
Italy, and sent a warlike lady as ambassador to the banks of the 
Tiber River; Clare Boothe Luce. 
  From the U.S. stabilization policy pursued in Italy since 
the 
end of the war, one may conclude that even today this policy is 
taking place behind closed doors. After all, from the U.S. 
angle, Italy possesses strategic importance. Despite all its 
problems and uncertainties, Italy continues to be one of the 
largest EU members. It is a direct neighbor of the war-torn 
Balkans, and, last but not least, quite close to the 
Mediterranean basin and the troubled Maghreb countries. Apart 
for that, Italian Americans play a major role in the media 
society of the United States, something that encourages feelings 
of friendship toward the motherland.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Joffe: "Liberators, Protectors, </F>
Pacifiers"] 
  [Text] D-Day was the beginning of the end of the Nazi 
dictatorship, the beginning of Europe's liberation. Hitler was 
dead nine months later and the 12-year-old Reich one week later. 
This is common history. 
  However, the "Longest Day" was more than just the military 
turning point, more than just the largest landing operation of 
all time, which will be reenacted in military academies for 
centuries -- like the battles of Cannae or Agincourt. In the 
first place, 6 June was also a political dividing line in 
Europe's history. It was the day on which the United States 
became a European power -- with enormous historical consequences 
on which the "Old Contingent" has lived for half a century. 
  Originally, this was not intended. The GI's who stormed the 
beaches of Normandy at dawn were only supposed to follow the 
footsteps of their fathers in World War I. They had gone to the 
"Great War" in 1917 -- and were back home again as early as in 
1919. While the United States lapsed into furious isolationism, 
Europe was going to the dogs slowly and then increasingly 
quickly. The victors -- England and France -- were drained of 
their life's blood and demoralized; instead of the dreamed-of 
peace system, a power vacuum developed and Europe fell easy prey 
to totalitarianism, which started a second, far more terrible 
world war only 20 years later. 
  In 1944, the Americans also wanted to play the role of the 
legendary lonesome cowboy who appears from nowhere, cleans up 
the town, and rides out into the sunset again. In February 
1945, in Yalta, Franklin Roosevelt still confided to his ally 
Josef ("Uncle Joe") that the U.S. troops would stay in Europe at 
best for two years. Once again, the United States wanted to 
return to the tradition that former President James Madison had 
cast into a resolution in 1783: "The United States' real 
interest requires that it gets entangled in the European 
nations' policies and quarrels as little as possible. " 
Congress unanimously agreed to this first document of 
isolationism. 
  The United States finally broke, though still unknowingly, 
with this tradition on 6 June 1944. After Roosevelt's death, 
his successor Truman asked the simple, but correct question, the 
answer to which was to determine the United States' policy 
toward Europe for half a century: "What is better for our 
country -- to spend $20 billion or $30 billion on the 
preservation of peace in the next four years or to repeat what 
we did in 1920, in order to be later obliged to pay $100 billion 
for four years of war?" 
<H5>  The U.S. Double Role </H5>
  The fact that the Americans invested in peace in their own 
interest -- that is, that they stayed with their soldiers in 
West Europe -- does not alter the fact that the Europeans 
benefited enormously from this mission. Europe, the country of 
the 30-Years' and the 100-Years' Wars, where "peace" was only a 
break between two passages of arms for centuries, suddenly 
became the isle of the blessed (apart from the Soviet repressive 
actions in the GDR, Hungary, and the CSSR). Without stability 
made in the United States, the happy ending of 1989/90 would 
have certainly not gone down in the history of the continent. 
  However, historical speculations have to go into it even 
more 
deeply and throw light on the U.S. double role: not only as a 
protector, but also as a pacifier of West Europe. After all, 
the question is: Why did the Germans and French shake hands in 
friendship after 1945, instead of flying at each other's throats 
again like in 1870, 1914, and 1940? Why were the small ones -- 
the Netherlands or Belgium -- able to embark on the beneficial 
adventure of integration with the big ones who had treated them 
so often as strategic playthings in the past? 
  The answer is simple: Because suddenly a power that was 
bigger and stronger than all of them together was anchored in 
the European system. The Pax Americana worked on both sides: 
outside and inside -- it protected the West Europeans from 
others and from themselves. Guaranteed security both inside and 
outside was the foundation on which it was possible to erect the 
great structure of European unification. The West Europeans no 
longer had to relapse into the old game of distrust and rivalry 
because the great reinsurer, the United States, was among them. 
  Dean Rusk, a U.S. secretary of state, expressed it in this 
way: "The presence of our troops also promoted inner-European 
cooperation. However, without the visible securing by a weighty 
U.S. contingent, old frictions could be revived and Europe be 
destabilized again." That was in 1967; is this insight still 
valid today? 
<H5>  "Ami Go Home?" </H5>
  Apparently yes, because today nobody chants "Ami go home" -- 
although the Soviet Union does not exist any longer, and the 
last Russian troops will go home this summer. The left-wingers 
who have grown older, who demonstrated against the Pershings 
only 10 years ago, and against the Vietnam War in their youth, 
are advocating with warm words that the D-Day offspring, whose 
number is rapidly decreasing to 100,000 and might even decrease 
further, stay. 
  The paradox is easy to crack. The Germans, the old 
bogeyman opponents in Europe, benefited strongly from the 
Americans' comforting presence. Today -- at least the clever 
Germans know this -- the gentle U.S. counterweight is also in 
the interests of the "greater Germany." For power can be 
exercised all the more easily if it is embedded in a stable 
balance of power that does not even permit the spreading of 
distrust. 
  Moreover, the classic insurance function of the U.S. 
presence 
has not yet been invalidated. Russia is on the road to reform, 
but it continues to be an unpredictable variable in the European 
security equation. In former times it was Russia's strength, 
today it is its weakness -- its inner instability -- that weighs 
on Europe. Here a reliable counterweight is always useful and 
this is hardly conceivable without the inclusion of the Atlantic 
superpower. 
  The United States' presence in Europe has not always been 
easy for the Europeans since the friendliest elephant is an 
inconvenient fellow because of its sheer power. However, if the 
advantages and disadvantages are added up, a sound surplus, 
which calls for gratitude, remains on balance. D-Day was really 
the beginning of the liberation, also and exactly, of the 
Germans. They also owe it to the Americans that they were so 
quickly accepted back into the community of nations after 
Hitler's horrors. The fact that West Europe preserved its 
freedom also cannot be separated from the United States' 
anchoring role. And what about the future? Here, only the 
insight from the history of the bloodiest of all European 
centuries remains: Europe has fared better with the United 
States as an anchor of stability than without it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "Brussels From Its Best </F>
Angle"] 
  [Text] EU [European Union] Commissioner Martin Bangemann 
could not miss such an opportunity to deliver a side-swipe. His 
Danish colleague Henning Christophersen had worked out for the 
public what it would cost the taxpayer to cover the European 
Union with a transportation infrastructure, especially one for a 
high-speed railroad service, in line with the ideas of the 
Brussels Commission. Christophersen arrived at a figure of 
between 30 and 40 billion German marks, which would account for 
between a quarter and a third of the total investment cost, 
excluding credit financing through EU institutions. The Dane 
then gave up his place before the television cameras to the 
German, who began his presentation with the words: "Our project 
does not require any public money." 
  Both commissioners were talking about "trans-European 
networks" (TEN), which the EU is already dreaming of as a symbol 
of the integration and economic renewal of the old continent. 
However, black and white have seldom been so close to each 
other. On the one hand, the Commission has been truly indulging 
in gigantic expenditure programs. The idea of European 
integration has already become perverted into the Right to put 
one's hand into one's neighbor's pocket, and it would appear 
that the people in Brussels want to go one further than that 
with their fast railroad network. On the other hand, they 
created the concept of the "information society" with which they 
have prompted a new "industrial revolution." "It is a 
revolution," begins the report that was prepared by Bangemann 
along with top European businessmen from the computer sector, 
"based on information. Technical progress places us in a 
position to communicate information in any form, irrespective of 
distance, time, and quantity." The opportunities for new 
economic activity and thus for work and jobs that this 
technology promises is something that today's ordinary mortal 
cannot imagine. 
  The report shows "Brussels" from its best angle. It is the 
European Commission's fundamental task to think for the 
community about what it must do if it does not want to drop out 
of the high performance economy league. That is what is 
happening, and the people in Brussels are not afraid to tell 
hard truths to the Europeans, who have been fixated about their 
superiority for ages: If they believe that the state will carry 
on fixing things, then they are lost. What counts in the future 
are not ministers, taxpayers, and regulations, but entrepreneurs 
and free markets.

<F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "A High Price for Harmony </F>
With Brussels"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 5 Jun -- Current Dutch Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers taking the presidential chair of the European 
Commission would agree with Germany's economic policy interests 
in the European Union [EU], but it would not fit in with 
France's interests. Therefore, Chancellor Helmut Kohl may once 
again have committed himself to his most important partner when 
he agreed with French President Francois Mitterrand to Belgian 
head of government Jean-Luc Dehaene as EU chief. This time, 
however, he is not just paying the usual economic price for the 
unbroken German-French harmony. He is also harming his 
country's other interests in European policy and he is even 
harming European integration. 
  In the Netherlands, citizens of every political color and 
interest now feel offended. As a small member country they see 
themselves constantly pushed aside by the "big ones" anyway. 
This time they see themselves particularly neglected by the 
Germans, on whom they depend economically. Therefore, they 
would rather deserve polite political attention. Certainly, the 
Dutch were rude in the process of German reunification. 
However, if the chancellor had used the opportunity to say: 
"Let us forget that. They want to provide their undisputed 
best man to Europe, and therefore we are taking him," he would 
have put them to shame and could have made great profit for the 
good-neighborly relations. Instead, one is now gathering 
negative points in the bilateral relations and for the entire 
EU, because the distrust that the small member states, above all 
the Netherlands, have for the "Bonn-Paris" axis can only grow, 
as Lubbers openly admits. 
  The Dutch have been thinking for quite some time and 
increasingly loudly about the value they are supposed to give to 
a community in which, as they can see, things are done more in 
line with the German-French tune than in line with common 
discussions and decisions. Thanks to the French power of 
prevailing, this community is, in addition, developing in a way 
that the Dutch do not like at all: bureaucratically and 
centralistically. In addition, just to strengthen German-French 
harmony by a hardly measurable quantity, the chancellor caused 
problems for British Prime Minister John Major. Since the 
Englishman, in contrast to Kohl, honors the economic policy 
harmony with Lubbers, he supports him. London's diplomats in 
Brussels unanimously predict that, because of his constant 
struggle with the "Eurorebels" in his own party, he cannot 
afford to give in to the French and the Germans. Thus, the 
forthcoming EU summit is threatened with a public display. 
Jacques Delors' successor is to be elected unanimously at this 
summit. The heads of government had promised that he will come 
from their own ranks. Now, against all expectations, they have 
two candidates and, promptly, they cannot agree on one? This 
would be an unprecedented embarrassment. In Brussels there are 
already bets that this embarrassment will lead to a compromise 
candidate, who will not come from among the persons attending 
the summit -- for instance, Peter Sutherland, the current GATT 
secretary general, a former commissioner in Brussels, and an 
Irishman. 
  In Brussels it is being assumed that the chancellor prefers 
Dehaene, because he finds Lubbers too difficult and independent. 
The Belgian would be better at running on the long leash of the 
chiefs in Bonn and Paris. If this is true, the European Kohl 
would have unmasked himself. Lubbers as head of the Brussels 
Commission would doubtlessly give a new value to the Commission. 
It is conceived as the motive force of European unification. 
However, the Dutchman's strength would probably be too much for 
the chancellor. 
  Not least, also in politics, much is a question of style. In 
the race for the European central bank, the Dutch were defeated 
by the Germans. Kohl could now have paid them back. This was 
all the more advisable since the Netherlands is the only 
founding member of the European Community that has not yet been 
permitted to provide a full-time president.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Claus Genrich: "Ordered Harmony"] </F>
  [Text] Even if the Free Democratic Party [FDP], the party 
of individualists, for once painfully demonstrates cohesiveness, 
it usually finds a way to avenge itself with a protesting flight 
into ambivalence for being forced into unity. Usually, in such 
cases party congress delegates are looking for a valve in an 
unexpected place, through which the steam can escape from the 
kettle of ordered harmony. The leadership is to feel that it 
cannot decide everything. 
  This time a majority demanded the future separation of 
office 
and mandate. The surprised ministers were told that they will 
soon have to choose between Bundestag mandate and government 
office. It remains their choice whether they will fulfill the 
wish of the congress. If, as it is to be expected, they do not 
care or make use of certain ways of interpretation to justify 
this, they will, however, become targets of attacks. What the 
Greens have just abolished after the experience of years of 
chaos, the FDP now wants to introduce. 
  A part of the ambivalence of not absolutely binding wishes 
by 
a party congress, which the ministers can make use of, consists 
of the justified assumption that, if worse comes to worst, the 
FDP will hardly give up its accustomed exercise of being, if 
possible, in the government. For this it needs tested deputies 
with their parliamentary support. The victorious motion was 
made by Kinkel's land association for other reasons: Deputy 
Bundestag Group Chairman Weng, who supports Kinkel, was so angry 
about secret agreements and dubious maneuvers, for instance in 
determining Genscher's successor as foreign minister, that he 
wanted to promote clarity via a roundabout route. Now, however, 
straightforward Kinkel is facing the problem of being 
consistent. After the Bundestag elections -- if the FDP should 
be able to participate in government again -- he will probably 
confront his party with the choice of accepting him as minister 
and as deputy or losing him as chairman. It is not he who 
intends to decide -- it is the party that should do it when the 
time comes. He runs for the Bundestag, of which he is currently 
not a member, and he seems to rely on being able to untie the 
knots once again at the end. 
  Kinkel may derive one reason for hoping that he will be able 
to get what he wants, also in the future, from the experience of 
the party congress in Rostock. The purpose of the event was 
fulfilled: The Bonn coalition with the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] will be continued if the 
FDP has its say. Kinkel was moving toward this vote at the 
party congress in several steps. He ignored Genscher and 
Moellemann's ideas about a schedule with a blow of liberation. 
Now, since Kinkel, who is still an apprentice as a tactician, 
has brought about this vote, he proudly and with satisfaction 
insists on having stepped out of the shadow of cleverer people 
without having suffered any harm. 
  However, here, too, there is ambivalence in the clarity. 
Kinkel was able to do without a condition for the coalition 
statement, because the condition is self-evident: the election 
result. If it is different from what Kohl and Kinkel expect 
with increasing self-confidence, the declaration of intent made 
in Rostock is moot. Then the never-contested principle that, 
basically, all democratic parties are able to form a coalition 
will be valid again. It will be shown what figures can bring 
about if they become more compelling than preferences. 
  Whether Scharping's Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
will then, however, still have a glance to spare for the FDP has 
become uncertain, to the sorrow of some renowned leading 
members, who now feel forced to gather around Kinkel. In 
Rostock the party, and particularly its chairman, sharply 
outlined the frontline between the CDU/CSU and the FDP on the 
one side and the SPD and the Greens on the other. Kinkel 
managed to convince his party that making a clear stand is more 
of an advantage than a disadvantage. Probably, the calculation 
that the FDP will win votes with this in October is correct, 
perhaps it will also win -- as in the past -- second votes from 
the voters of the CDU/CSU. They might save the FDP from a fall, 
but they would not increase the total number of votes for the 
coalition. 
  The FDP wants to attract new voters with its program. But 
from where? The Rostock fireworks will vanish or will hardly be 
noticed. If they so choose, medium-sized entrepreneurs can feel 
as supported as unmarried couples and homosexuals. With its 
domestic and legal policy along the old progressive pattern, the 
FDP wants to prove independence, but without irritating the 
CDU/CSU too much. Solms continues to rely on the compromise 
course of the Bundestag group, on practical reason and solidity. 
Almost in the same way as the CDU must rely on Kohl, the FDP 
will have to rely on Kinkel; Genscher is paling, Lambsdorff only 
occasionally lets rhetorical sparks fly, which did not glint 
anywhere in the hall in Rostock. 
  Kinkel has become more authoritarian and self-confident. 
This may be a benefit for him if he does not let himself be 
deceived: The obedience is forced by the pressure of the 
election year and the lack of persons. The valve of displeasure 
will probably not have consequences this time. After the 
elections -- regardless of the result -- one need not have so 
much consideration for the chairman. However, first it is 
important what will happen in October: Kinkel is acting with 
almost so much determination, attacking the SPD so harshly, that 
it seems he has burnt a few bridges behind him because he 
believes he does not need them anymore. The FDP may gain 
impetus from that.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "This Is How Italy Moved to the </F>
Right"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Everything has changed, but the terms 
"Right" and "Left" still retain a precise political meaning. 
This is evidenced by an SWG [Integrated Research Services] poll 
conducted from 1990 to the present. 
  The most obvious result is the increased number of Italians 
who resolutely profess to be right-wing. However, the results 
of the SWG survey, which we publish with this report, should be 
read taking into account the various stages in our recent 
history, starting from the remarkable percentage (39.6 percent) 
of those who professed to be center-left in 1990, at the height 
of the five-party system. By the end of 1991, on the eve of the 
local elections, this group began to disintegrate, flowing into 
the Center and center-right categories, headed by the Northern 
League. 
  After the 1993 municipal elections, the center-left 
continued 
to crumble away, while the Left gave signs of recovery and the 
Right started its new, uninterrupted growth. The number of 
center-left citizens diminished proportionally by half, the 
center-right became stable, and the Left's rise was confirmed. 
In fact, the resulting polarization reflects the new electoral 
model, which completely upset the previous balance of forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Secretary Giorgio La Malfa </F>
by Roberto Petrini; place and date not given: "La Malfa: They 
Have Lost Their Bearings"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The first power-sharing deals are 
taking place, privatization is being slowed down, reorganization 
plans, such as Alitalia's, are being blocked. Giorgio La Malfa, 
during a pause between the rallies of the European election 
campaign, drew up a balance sheet of the moves made so far by 
Berlusconi's new government, three weeks after its birth and 24 
hours after the rapping on the knuckles from the Bank of Italy's 
governor. "Liberalism? I believe not a trace of it is left," 
the Italian Republican Party secretary said. "But, above all, 
there is no trace of the coherent economic policy which the 
country badly needs." 
  [Petrini] Deputy La Malfa, let us start with what the Bank 
of 
Italy's governor had to say. Do you approve? 
  [La Malfa] I should say so. Fazio's words were a polite but 
firm way of urging the government to make its economic policy 
clear. 
  [Petrini] Judging from its platform, the majority should be 
pursuing a policy inspired on liberal principles: fewer taxes, 
deregulation of the labor market, individualism. Is this so? 
  [La Malfa] These were the principles inspiring the election 
campaign. Before the elections, the majority proposed an 
economic expansion policy to be implemented by reducing taxes. 
However, a problem has now arisen: Such a policy does not 
accord with the necessary reconstruction of public finances. 
What does the government intend to do? Will it pursue the 
liberalism it proclaimed during the election campaign or will it 
follow [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's road, trying to 
reconcile support for economic recovery with the attempt to 
reduce the debt? 
  [Petrini] In your opinion, what path is it following? 
  [La Malfa] In my view, it is making a U-turn, going back on 
the liberal intentions vaunted during the election campaign. 
  [Petrini] Does this mean that the "gap" in public finances 
will force the government to take back its promise of reducing 
taxes? 
  [La Malfa] Most probably. I do not have any precise figures, 
but I know from my own experience that, every year, an 
adjustment in the region of 15 to 20 trillion lire [L] is 
necessary. This is without taking account of the fact that 
possibly certain figures were underestimated in this year's 
budget too. 
  [Petrini] What is your assessment of Berlusconi's first 
steps 
in the past three weeks? 
  [La Malfa] As regards privatization, the government stepped 
heavily on the brake. It decided to retain 51 percent of the 
INA [National Insurance Institute] for the Treasury and to 
continue government control through the "golden share" mechanism 
in public-sector companies. In these companies, it has not 
hesitated to appoint its own people to the boards of directors, 
as the Rasi-Telecom case shows. As regards the Alitalia issue, 
[Transportation] Minister Fiori immediately blocked the company 
reorganization plan which had been prepared by two capable 
managers such as Riverso and Schisano. 
  [Petrini] Still, a first decree on employment has been 
drafted. 
  [La Malfa] The law on employment is a copy of [former Labor 
Minister] Giugni's. As far as the South is concerned, I have 
noticed a contradiction in relation to the approach advocated 
during the election campaign, and I see nothing new in relation 
to the past. 
  [Petrini] What do you think of Gasparri's remarks on 
Bankitalia? 
  [La Malfa] Gasparri, the National Alliance's chief 
economist, 
vetoed the appointment of Padoa Schioppa who, among other 
things, is Bankitalia's senior director and therefore the most 
natural successor to Dini's post [at the Bank of Italy]. This 
stance is creating enormous embarrassment for the Bank of 
Italy's governor. If he appoints Padoa Schioppa, he will be 
challenging the government, and if he does not, then it means 
that the Bank of Italy has given up its own independence. At 
this point, I can only hope that what is involved is just an 
untimely remark, and that Berlusconi will immediately distance 
himself from it.

  [Text] Mare Nostrum is the code name of the anti-Mafia 
operation currently underway in Sicily. The operation has led 
to over 200 preventive detention orders being issued and has 
given investigators a detailed map of the ramifications of Cosa 
Nostra in the province of Messina. Nino Amante reports: 
  [Amante] The blitz began at 0300 last night, when 1,500 
police officers and carabinieri were posted along the top of the 
Nebrodi mountain range and laid siege to the villages of 
(Dossoice) and Mistretta and the town of Barcellona Pozzo di 
Gotto, the largest locality on Messina's Tyrrhenian coast. 
  Through half-closed windows the local inhabitants were able 
to see one of the most imposing anti-Mafia operations ever 
carried out in Sicily. Judges issued 222 preventive detention 
orders for a large number of different charges -- from criminal 
association to arms and drugs trafficking, and to extortion. 
However, there is also talk of some 40 murders. Thus far, 125 
people have been arrested. A further 40 managed to avoid 
capture; 53 alleged mafiosi who are already in prison on other 
charges were served with fresh arrest warrants. 
  During the operation there were moments of high tension. For 
instance, one officer, Paolo Passaniti, 26, suffered a slight 
head wound when he was shot by Gaetano Farranda, one of the 
wanted men who was trying to avoid capture. The operation 
netted arms and explosives and a number of carabinieri uniforms. 
  Last night's operation, which was codenamed Mare Nostrum, 
was 
the fruit of months of investigations which were helped by the 
confession of a well-known boss, Orlando Galati Giordano, the 
head of a clan based in Messina. 
  The clans caught up in last night's operation had close 
links 
not only with Cosa Nostra but also with the Neapolitan Camorra.

  [Text] This morning the first meeting of the newly 
installed RAI [Italian Radio and Television] parliamentary 
oversight committee took place in Piazza San Macuto. RAI 
Director General Gianni Locatelli was also at the meeting. At 
the top of the agenda was the initiative by the Marco Taradash, 
chairman of the committee who yesterday handed over a number of 
documents that cast doubt on the legality of some of the 
management methods at the public broadcaster to the Rome 
prosecutor's office. Donato Bendicenti reports: 
  [Bendicenti] San Macuto the day after the storm. Marco 
Taradash, the newly elected chairman of the RAI oversight 
committee, arrived first and he appeared to be in good spirits. 
He had called a meeting of the committee at 1030 and one of the 
possible topics for discussion was the visit that he paid 
yesterday morning -- just a few hours after his election -- to 
the Rome prosecutor, Michele Coiro. Taradash handed over a 
number of documents to the prosecutor which concerned the 
management of RAI. According to the new chairman of the 
overisght committee, these documents show how the company failed 
to fulfill its public service duties, and was instead used by 
the political parties. Taradash has asked if there are grounds 
for bringing prosecutions, and of course his visit has managed 
to make front-page headlines. The opposition parties are vying 
with each other to see which will make the harshest criticism. 
  In fact, this morning Passiglia, a deputy from the 
Democratic 
Alliance, lodged a complaint at the prosecutor's office against 
Taradash. Passiglia said that if Taradash knew of illegal 
episodes taking place then he ought to have visited the judge 
immediately without waiting to be elected as committee chairman. 
  How will the matter end? Fabrizio del Noce, who is the man 
in charge of Forza Italia's press communications, is skeptical. 
He said that, if behind gestures such as Taradash's there was 
the desire to break up the public broadcaster, then he would 
play no part in it. This is also the position of Forza Italia. 
  The position of Francesco Storacce, who is from the National 
Alliance and deputy chairman of the committee, is much more 
hard-line. He said that serious things had happened at RAI, if 
not in the legal sense then certainly in the moral sense. 
Storacce added that he wanted to dismantle the party politics 
at the network and proposed that a subcommittee be set up to 
review the executive appointments made at RAI since last August.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Petrini: "Right Critical: Governor Must </F>
Not Interfere"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Berlusconi's team, having been criticized 
by the Bank of Italy, issued an irritated reply, and proceeded 
to accelerate the launch of its program for the first 100 days. 
Pensions, inflation, fiscal pressure: The three warnings that 
Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio issued to the majority 
yesterday were received with embarrassment by the government 
circles closest to Prime Minister Berlusconi. The response from 
Forza Italia, entrusted to lower house floor leader Raffaele 
Della Valle, was a sharp one: "I express reservations," he said 
a few hours after the Bank of Italy meeting, "concerning the 
parts of the `Final Considerations' that relate directly to 
Parliament's and the government's sphere of responsibility. I 
am referring in particular to the references to such important 
sectoral policies as those on welfare and public works." AN's 
[National Alliance] Under Secretary for Industry Francesco 
Pontone was firm: "The Bank of Italy must not believe that it 
can influence the government by telling it what it should or 
should not do." The following sharp comment came from 
Institutional Reforms Minister Francesco Speroni: "A pointless 
list of obvious things." Minister for Relations with Parliament 
Giuliano Ferrara was surprised too, especially by Fazio's 
warning about the danger of inflation if it is decided to 
stimulate recovery by favoring only consumption. "The 
government," he said, "will do its utmost to disprove that 
economic recovery also implies a resumption of inflation." 
  The task of keeping alive the diplomatic interplay between 
the government and the Bank of Italy fell to Giancarlo 
Pagliarini, the League's budget minister. "I never said that 
the system of capitalizing pensions should be introduced 
overnight," the budget minister said defensively, replying to 
Fazio's attacks on the abolition of the mechanism that currently 
supports the pension system. "I am simply saying that we should 
set ourselves the aim of moving on from a system of distribution 
to a system of capitalization. For that matter Fazio himself," 
he added, "talks in terms of a 'broad distribution' of a 
benefits system based on capitalization. So he accepts that we 
should move in that direction." 
  What about fiscal pressure, which Fazio considers lower than 
in other countries? "Fiscal pressure is too high in Italy," 
Pagliarini said. "It can hardly be compared with other 
countries; be that as it may, we have no intention of creating a 
greedy revenue system." It was the same story with the proposal 
to grant tax relief to industry, which Fazio seemed to want to 
curb when he recalled the extent of existing tax relief for 
industry. "I agree with the thousand per thousand," he added. 
"I too drew up a large number of bills during the previous 
legislative period to cut down tax benefits to enterprises. A 
rational plan must be drawn up and benefits must be granted only 
if new jobs are created." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] A little less than an hour ago in Milan, the 
finance police entered the headquarters of Mediobanca, the 
temple of Italian financial life. They delivered four 
cautionary warrants. Antonio Graziani reports: 
  [Graziani] Honorary President Enrico Cuccia, Director 
General 
Vincenzo Maranghi, and Directors Maurizio Romiti and Gerardo 
Braggiotti are the Mediobanca directors who received the four 
cautionary warrants issued this afternoon by Ravenna prosecutor 
Francesco Mauro Iacoviello. The news was given with an official 
communique signed by the very same prosecutor who is 
investigating the role played by Mediobanca in the Ferruzzi 
affair. [passage omitted] 
  Although we took into account the ideas put forward by 
Professor Dominioni [Mediobanca lawyer] in his defense document 
and by Professor Trimarchi [Milan law professor] in his 
pro-veritate statement--says the official document issued by the 
Ravenna prosecution office--we think that at this point in the 
investigation we must issue the cautionary warrants in order to 
continue the investigation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Furio Colombo: "Bad Memories"] </F>
  [Text] Bill Clinton has come to Italy to visit two 
countries (the Vatican and Italy) on behalf of two Americas (the 
isolationist one that keeps telling him "us first," and that 
which bears the great international role and which is demanding 
from him a global presence and leadership). In so doing he is 
obliged to travel in time, to traverse history twice: Once, to 
revisit the victory. And once, for a meeting with the specters 
of the past, which that victory declared finished forever. 
  I used the word "specters" deliberately, because the NEW 
YORK 
TIMES has used it frequently in its commentaries on 
post-election Italy, which are still anxious. On the day when 
the American president is due to speak in Rome the NEW YORK 
TIMES addresses him twice. On page three the newspaper says: 
"Italian neofascism will make Clinton's diplomacy tough." On 
page 22, the New York daily's first editorial devoted to Italy 
has the headline, "Bad Memories in Italy." 
  Even if this is the direction of the difficulties that 
Clinton has to contend with on his first major international 
appearance, we know, even before we hear him speak, that the 
American president too will be obliged to split himself in two. 
One Clinton, aware of the delicacy of his mission and of his 
role as guest, will display cordiality, his famous smile, and 
kind remarks which it will not be inappropriate to interpret as 
encouragement and good wishes for the new government. 
  The other Clinton, an anxious one, will examine the signals 
and try to understand whether the anxiety that has spread 
through the world exists purely and simply as a reflection of 
the past or because there is a real fear that the past will 
return. 
  "Bad Memories" provides some pointers. The NEW YORK TIMES 
editorial, starting with its headline, presents its leaders with 
the jigsaw puzzle of tone, style, rumors (and "gaffes," 
according to the newspaper) created around this period in 
Italy's life. It puts forward the following simple arguments: 
There is no dispute over the horror of the past (of "that" 
past). Indeed, we -- all the world's non-Fascist and non-Nazi 
forces -- united to destroy it. But what can be the aim or 
purpose or use of digging up the corpse, bringing back the smell 
of death of that time? 
  The editorial seems to be conveying mainly a certain sense 
of 
surprise. It sounds more like an appeal for sensitivity than a 
condemnation of a policy line or a proposed condemnation. It 
seems to be asking some Italians, without any attempt to 
interfere: How can you want an appeal to that past? And how 
can such an appeal serve your domestic life, your economic 
recovery, your creative impulse, your international future? 
  Clinton will certainly have a copy of that editorial in his 
briefcase. But Clinton, president of the country that has been 
the leader of the world and that is returning to Europe as 
leader of the 1945 victory, has openly crossed the lines between 
present and past by emphasizing above all the greatness of the 
good alliance and the intention that it survive any 
misunderstandings and continue to exist. This, since that 
alliance among the "good" allies is the very one that brought 
the world from the Normandy landing to the collapse of the 
Berlin Wall, keeping it free of prejudice, discrimination, 
contempt, and any limitations of freedom. 
  The American president and his aides found valuable support, 
almost a solution to the dilemma (mere formalities or some kind 
of substantive statement about the new Italy?) by concentrating, 
at least in statements made to the American press, on the crisis 
in North Korea, which is becoming serious, to the nuclear threat 
which seems to be returning. There can be no expedients in that 
part of the world. Whatever happens, the Korean crisis shows 
that Clinton's America cannot demobilize with respect to 
international problems. 
  Then there are the remarks devoted explicitly to this 
government, which American television cautiously framed with the 
"causes for anxiety over the presence of ministers having some 
connection with Fascism." Clinton says: Let us look forward. 
In so doing he seems to have found the right balance. 
  The dual emphasis on confidence in the country and on the 
need to look to the future seems to mean: Instead of letting 
your wheels spin in the sands of time, consider whether you 
should not make a leap forward. A leap forward in employment, 
initiative, and cooperation also means a sharp break with the 
bad taste anxiously evoked in the NEW YORK TIMES editorial. 
  After Clinton has passed through the streets of Rome, we 
Italians will again find ourselves on the two sides of sharply 
opposing alternatives: Should we interpret it all as a 
celebration and normalization? Or should we interpret every 
expression of anxiety (as happens more in Europe than in 
America) and antagonism as the sign of an anti-Italian front, 
every time as a conspiracy against the country, or as the start 
of a new resistance? 
  But this day in Rome could be useful, over and above 
diplomatic courtesies. It could remind some people that it 
would be better to avoid an obsessive "marching on the spot," 
with attention hypnotized by a single topic, as though the flow 
of political events could remain frozen. And it could suggest 
to others that they stop displaying such bad taste (or 
provocativeness) as to refer to their past as though it were a 
normal alternative of history. It is not. If the war had ended 
differently, the world would look frighteningly different. Bill 
Clinton's mere presence here has told everyone so, irrespective 
of what he says. 
  But Clinton also had to play a twofold role in his brief -- 
and, some say, not easy -- meeting with the pope. Again, 
Clinton -- by nature conciliatory and willing to put himself in 
other people's shoes -- had to engage in that conversation with 
the heavy burden of American public opinion, disinclined to 
accept the Catholic theory of the limitless multiplication of 
children in the world. And, we imagine, he will have had to 
draw a dividing line between one vision and the other of the 
future and the function of the international agencies, of the 
United Nations first and foremost, and the plan for birth 
control worldwide. 
  Once again Clinton was forced to realize America's influence 
in the world and will have had to consider whether the United 
States really can distance itself from a world leader such as 
the pope and whether they could not find some common ground in 
their disagreement by shifting to the aspect of protecting the 
world, rather than the aspect of limitation. 
  But Clinton's day in Rome was certainly not a waste of time. 
Not for him, who was made fully aware of the vacuum and 
disorientation that can result from America's absence or 
neglect. And not for us, if we really believe that American 
democracy -- the most steadfast and stable in the world -- 
remains the reference point for our life and political approach.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alberto Ronchey: "Minister Martino's Hasty </F>
Steps"] 
  [Text] A few days ago the visit to Washington by new 
Foreign Minister Antonio Martino had the aim of launching a "new 
look," a great Italian diplomatic presence on the international 
scene. This purpose was favored by the cordial welcome granted 
by such newspapers as the WASHINGTON POST to the minister who 
knows how to "say things openly in clear and correct English." 
The endeavor also entailed some legitimate, though not easily 
negotiable, demands. 
  The first issue was the demand for a permanent seat for the 
Italian Government on the UN Security Council, if and when the 
Germans and Japanese are admitted to that body. According to 
reports, Warren Christopher's sole reply was that it can be 
discussed. But in what terms? If it is true that Germany and 
Japan, unlike Italy, will not take part in UN military 
operations, it is also true that they are two crucial world 
economic superpowers. 
  The second issue was the demand that the Italian Government 
be admitted soon to the "contact group" that decides on 
interventions in Bosnia, which has hitherto been confined to the 
United States, Russia, France, Britain, and Germany. Again, 
according to reports, Warren Christopher apparently replied by 
citing certain difficulties. So Antonio Martino, perhaps 
anxious to exert the maximum pressure, publicly acknowledged the 
possibility that Italian troops could serve as Blue Helmets in 
Bosnia as long as the action is conducted under NATO command and 
is definitely a peacekeeping operation of short duration after 
an agreement is reached among all the warring sides. 
  But it is reasonable to express cautious and serious 
objections to such a prospect. On the basis of the disturbing 
experiences had hitherto, nobody can guarantee that agreements 
between the enemy sides will be honored, that the so-called 
peacekeeping operation would not degenerate and/or that it would 
be short-lived. As everyone knows, the theater of events lies 
across ancient borders between inaccessible or turbulent regions 
that have always been in discord -- those formerly governed by 
the Austro-Hungarian Empire and those that belonged to the 
Ottoman Empire. If the offer of Italian troops to serve as Blue 
Helmets is based on conditions that are bound to prove 
impossible, then this is merely a policy of gestures. If, 
however, the aim is also to challenge the unknown or to take 
chances, then the risks to the Italian people are incalculable. 
  UN operations in areas at war or affected by guerrilla 
warfare are, under the regulations, entrusted to troops 
belonging to non- bordering nations that have never in the past 
been occupying powers. 
  Germany is excluded from any military operation, on the 
basis 
of constitutional exclusions. For its part, Austria, neutral 
since 1955, is almost like Switzerland. Why send the Italians 
-- the sons or grandsons of the soldiers of 1941 -- to Bosnia? 
Better the French, British, Russians, or even Ukrainians. This 
geostrategic peninsula is like an aircraft carrier at the 
service of the United Nations and NATO over the Adriatic. 
Infantrymen are needed more in Calabria, against the tormenting 
internal guerrilla warfare of the Mafia. 
  In the ghastly upheavals in the Balkans, the Croats, Serbs, 
and Muslims do not forget anything about their ancient conflicts 
or their respective ancient wrongs, let alone the wrongs of 
others. Anyone who has traveled widely through the lands of the 
now- dissolved Yugoslavia is well aware that the polite welcome 
afforded to Italians from Ljubljana to Skopje implies neither 
unconditional friendliness nor forgetfulness. Nobody wants to 
see a return of German, Austrian, or even Italian troops, with 
or without Blue Helmets. Indeed, nobody has forgotten the fact 
that the invasion by Hitler's Panzer divisions was prompted in 
April 1941 by Italy's surrender on the Greek-Albanian front, nor 
have they forgotten the partitioning of Slovenia between Hitler 
and Mussolini, or the handing over of the kingdom of Croatia by 
Pavelic to Duke of Spoleto Amedeo Savoia Aosta. 
  Antonio Martino will of course have considered all this, but 
perhaps not enough. The question is not how a well-intentioned 
but risky operation should begin, but how it might end. Back in 
1992 it was proposed that Italian troops be used at least in 
escorting humanitarian convoys bound for Bosnia. To the 
objection that the route would be long and full of obstacles, 
perhaps under cross-fire from Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian 
Muslims, some people replied that history is also composed of 
such bold expeditions as the wagon trains headed for the 
American West in the last century. This was an ill-considered 
and ill-augured example, since it evoked memories of the deadly 
ambush at Little Big Horn in which General Custer met his death. 
And that was the last that was heard of it, until now.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Vittorio Feltri: "Searching for the Left"] </F>
  [Text] I do not know about you, dear readers, but I find 
this never-ending controversy over the fascists in the 
government, on their presumed return to the scene, on the danger 
that the black boots will trample upon the values of democracy 
and even human rights, a mediocre soap opera that one would do 
well not to contribute to, not even in a "guest appearance." 
However, it offers an opportunity to delve into another topic, 
that we could say is a parallel one. Why is the Left obliged to 
clutch to worn-out and frayed pretexts such as the rebirth of 
fascism in Italy to demonstrate its vitality, or rather, its 
very existence? Is it because every time a person of some 
importance emerges, such as [Northern League Secretary] Bossi or 
a [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, it feels the need to bring back 
to mind that balcony on Piazza Venezia where the "square 
jawbone" [Mussolini] exhibited himself? Do these seem to be the 
proper reasons for blocking the rise of new political forces? 
  For half a century now the Left has dug up the corpse of 
Mussolini and thrown it in our faces when it finds itself in 
difficulty. Those who have a good memory will not have 
forgotten what the Christian Democrats were called in the 
1920's: "clerical fascists." Nor will they have forgotten the 
slogans of 1968 against anybody who did not support 1968: 
"fascist, bourgeois, only a few months more." Slogans from 
which one deduced that, in the language used by the barbarians 
of the era, fascist and bourgeois were synonymous. 
  The decades have passed, walls have fallen, religious 
ideologies have faded, empires that seemed unassailable behind 
iron curtains have dissolved, but our left-wing parties, even 
those that have given themselves a new coat of paint, continue 
to act in the same way, almost as if time has stopped in the era 
of Giolitti. Fossil-like parties, conservatives wearing the 
label of progressives illicitly, stiffened with an anti-fascist 
manner that prevents them from seeing no other enemy except the 
duce [Mussolini] and his grandchildren. And the fact that the 
duce's grandchildren do not count at all, do not have a role in 
the government, does not matter to the Left. It undauntedly 
continues to see in all of them the adversaries, and to waste 
energy in fighting them, energy that could be much better used 
for its reconstruction in order to finally become a valid, 
reliable, and modern alternative to the hated Right. A Right 
that may even be a shuffler -- as [LA VOCE editor] Indro 
Montanelli maintains one day yes and the other day also yes -- 
it may be a hotchpotch, it may be a Brancaleone army, it may 
even have a naive and extemporaneous leader, however, whatever 
it may be, it has found room for growth in a few months. It has 
found this room because it has looked for it, it has had the 
courage to challenge even the ridiculous, it has resorted to 
flamboyant gestures: repeated opinion polls, marketing, mass 
communications, few concepts but clear ones, no concession being 
made to abstract ideas, the utmost attention being placed on the 
daily problems that afflict the people, a low profile but an 
extremely high regard for the voter, no disdain for things that 
are popular. 
  Yes, popular. An adjective that horrifies the Left instead. 
And it would be sufficient to analyze this horror to understand 
where the would-be progressives failed. They do not like the 
people because they make the air unbreathable in the subways, 
because they watch Wheel of Fortune on television, live in 
dejected and opaque apartment buildings in the suburbs, or -- 
those that are the more fortunate live in townhouses with 
statues of dwarves in their gardens -- go to Rimini instead of 
Capalbio, read little and the little that they do read is from 
IL MANIFESTO, love the consumer world because it is better than 
famine. The progressives do not like the people because they 
vote, and vote for the League, Forza Italia, and National 
Alliance. Excuse me, but why should they vote for somebody that 
they do not respect. 
  The real problem of this country is not the presence of a 
disjointed right-wing majority, but the absence of a Left that 
is not repressive, reactionary, conceited, antiquated, a snob, 
closed from the western world, in love with bureaucracy, 
utopias, beautiful laws (like Law No. 180 for the mentally ill) 
that cannot be applied and have not been applied, of public 
schools and all the public services that the progressives do not 
use. Yes, the danger is precisely this, an anachronistic, 
archaic Left, that has remained with Luciano Lama and his 
orchestra in the square, nostalgic of Marxist dogmas, unable to 
free itself of the old communist attire and give itself a 
modern, European, free trade, and social identity. Of course 
Occhetto did try to renew things. He did renew things. However, 
he did not go right through to the end, nor could he, with his 
past and his background. The Left needs more in order to avoid 
being confused over what it was, a daughter of the Soviet Union. 
It will take one generation, or rather two. Provided these are 
enough. But as long as we do not have a Left made of men of the 
Left, and have instead false intellectual snobs, or masked PPI 
[Italian Popular Party] men, the Right will have no rivals.

  [Text] Deng Nan, daughter of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, 
visited the Vatican this morning to view the Sistine Chapel. 
The news was officially confirmed by the spokesman for the Holy 
See, Joaquin Navarro Valls, who insisted on the private nature 
of her visit. 
  However, it cannot be excluded that the presence of Deng 
Nan, 
who is the deputy minister for culture in her country, could 
also be interpreted as a further step in the direction of a 
rapprochement between the Holy See and China, following the 
severing of diplomatic links in the 1950's.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gian Franco Svidercoschi: "A Promise to the </F>
Pope"] 
  [Text] Operation Image was a complete success. Bill 
Clinton can return home to boast of the complete success of his 
mission to the Vatican. The pope, standing up to welcome him 
without once leaning on his cane, was the first to impart some 
solemnity and at the same time cordiality to the meeting. 
Ambassador Flynn went rather too far by talking in terms of a 
"family meeting." But perhaps partly because of the symbolic 
scenario, because of the festive atmosphere that prevailed 
within the Vatican -- yesterday was the feast of Corpus Domini 
and offices were closed -- the U.S. President's visit ultimately 
acquired the status of a major event. 
  But it was nevertheless an image operation. Clinton will not 
be able to do the same as his predecessor, Bush. Bush came to 
the Vatican in November 1991, in the wake of the dispute with 
the Vatican over the Gulf War. But then, just 24 hours after 
his audience, during his visit to Spain, he announced the U.S. 
involvement in the Balkans, thus responding positively to the 
pope's pressing request to him the previous day. 
  Clinton, however, cannot do this. Their stances remained far 
apart on the main issue of their conversation -- the document on 
population and development being drafted for the Cairo 
conference. John Paul II reaffirmed the Vatican's criticisms of 
the plan, considering it lacking a clear ethical vision and 
judging it the prelude to an indiscriminate international 
legalization of abortion. Hence the appeal, as in Denver, to the 
"responsibility" of a great nation, which "originally and 
through the course of its history has always advocated the 
ethical values that lie at the root of any civilization." 
Clinton argued his own case. He cited the pledges made during 
his presidential campaign (when, however, he rejected the 
primitive pro-life stance) to correct the orientations of the 
1984 Mexico City conference. He spoke about "safe, legal, and 
rare" abortion -- but only as a solution to the tragedy of the 
millions of women who die every year as a result of abortions 
performed with no guarantees of safety. He spoke about "access" 
to contraception, but only in order to curb population growth 
within the context of impoverished areas suffering environmental 
decline. 
  Their stances remain distant. "And I do not think that the 
pope will change his mind," a White House spokesman said. But 
-- and this is the novelty -- Clinton apparently promised some 
changes to the Cairo document, at least in its language, an 
attenuation of some excessively peremptory statements. And as 
early as yesterday he provided some useful explanations: For 
instance, that, unlike China, he definitely does not regard 
abortion as a method of birth control. So the final result was 
an unprecedented joint commitment to a policy to promote a 
"responsible growth" of the population (demanded by the United 
States) and at the same time to reaffirm the "central role" of 
the family (a Vatican demand). 
  This is certainly a very significant result. It joins the 
many points of agreement on the international situation, and 
especially the anxiety over the serious restrictions of 
religious freedom in Asia (China and Vietnam), the Islamic 
states' role in the future of the world, and the definition of 
the status of Jerusalem. So though in Mexico City in 1984 
Reagan's United States was the Vatican's number-one ally over 
the population issue, Clinton's United States could now be so on 
the front of peace and international justice.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the 
Republic of Cyprus will ask to participate in an international 
conference in Cyprus, if such a meeting is held. The spokesman 
clarified that among the alternatives being discussed include 
convening an international conference and the visit by 
representatives of the five UN Security Council permanent 
members. 
  The Cypriot Government welcomed the reference to the Cyprus 
issue, which is contained in the final resolution of the 
Nonaligned Movement foreign minister's meeting, held in Cairo. 
The spokesman said the resolution contains a series of positive 
points for Cyprus and noted the specific reference to UN 
Security Council Resolutions 365, 541, and 550 and the request 
for an international conference. 
  Commenting on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' statement 
about signing a nonaggression pact between the two communities, 
the government spokesman said this would be meaningful if a 
similar treaty would also be signed between Cyprus and Turkey. 
He added that the fear and danger comes from Turkey, which 
holds part of Cyprus, not from the Turkish Cypriot community.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has urged UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to issue a new report to reflect 
realistically the Turkish Cypriot side's approach on the package 
of confidence-building measures. Describing the resolution to 
be adopted by the UN Security Council as important, Denktas said 
that the future of the talks will depend on it. 
  President Denktas received Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary 
general's deputy special representative, this afternoon. 
Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defense Atay Ahmet Rasit, Under 
Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Ozer Koray, Presidential 
Advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun Olgun, and Adviser on 
Special Political Affairs [title as heard] John Paul Cavanaugh 
attended the meeting. 
  In a statement after the meeting, which lasted nearly an 
hour, President Denktas said the Turkish Cypriot side wants the 
UN secretary general to change the untrue and unjust views he 
has included in his report against the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  [Begin Denktas recording] We worked with Gustave Feissel on 
31 May. We gave him a memorandum that removed all the problems. 
However, the UN secretary general's report is dated 30 May. It 
does not refer to the work carried out on 31 May. It blamed and 
even insulted the Turkish Cypriot side. Naturally, that state 
of affairs has drawn our attention. We have invited Gustave 
Feissel here to ask him that a new report be drawn up to inform 
the UN Security Council that the Turkish Cypriot side is 
prepared to agree to the map [on Varosha] and the views on the 
access road to that area on the condition that the agreement 
that was reached in the Vienna talks is included in the main 
document. We hope that this is done. [end recording] 
  A correspondent asked Denktas whether the UN Security 
Council 
will adopt a resolution. He replied: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] A resolution may or may not be 
adopted. If a resolution is to be adopted, then we want it to 
be done realistically. The new resolution should not be slanted 
toward the view expressed in the first report that the Turkish 
Cypriot side lacks the will to reach reconciliation and 
establish peace. It must be based on the view that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has used its will in a constructive way until the 
last moment and has submitted constructive proposals that have 
safeguarded the Turkish Cypriot people's rights. That must be 
realized. We want a new resolution to be adopted reflecting 
this. The resolution to be adopted can either kill or 
facilitate the negotiating process. [end recording] 
  On his part, Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that he 
will convey President Denktas' message to the UN secretary 
general. Feissel declined to respond to a question on whether a 
supplementary report can be drawn up. Meanwhile, Turkish 
Cypriot journalists protested that Feissel either declined to 
reply to their questions or gave evasive answers. They recalled 
that, although he declined to reply to their questions on the 
talks, he made disclosures to the Greek Cypriot journalists as 
soon as he crossed into the Greek Cypriot side. Feissel claimed 
that this was not true.

<F P=106> [Report by F. Aryirou--passages in parentheses published in </F>
English] 
  [Text] London--With the confidence-building measures, the 
return of all refugees to their homes and property is being 
sacrificed and the Cyprus problem is being restricted to the 
Famagusta issue. This is the appraisal of [UK] constitutional 
expert Mrs. Claire Palley, a consultant for the Cyprus 
Government. 
  According to our information from official Cyprus Government 
documents, Mrs. Palley has recommended against accepting the 
confidence-building measures. "For a desert that belongs to 
them," the English constitutional expert says (meaning 
Famagusta), "the return of all the Greek Cypriot refugees is 
being sacrificed." The English constitutional expert also 
accuses the other experts whom the government has used of giving 
distorted opinions because they were ignorant of international 
law. 
  Commenting on the confidence-building measures, Mrs. Palley 
maintains: "All the refugees will be sacrificed for the return 
of a desert area, that is, Varosha (to get the return of a 
desert to which its owners are entitled, all other Greek Cypriot 
refugees are being sacrificed-- what used to be called 
Famagustization of the Cyprus problem).'' 
  Mrs. Palley also reproaches the experts whom the Cyprus 
Government used as consultants on the confidence-building 
measures and accuses them of naivete on matters of international 
law. The English constitutional expert says that their opinion 
("...just proves the legal and political incompetence of the 
experts") and adds: "The experts' naivete in international law 
is revealed," [quotation published in English] and that 
("ignorance of international law is revealed by purported 
factual statements").

<F P=106> [Editorial from HELSINGIN SANOMAT excerpted by </F>
HUFVUDSTADSBLADET under rubric "Discussion of the Day"] 
  [Excerpts] HELSINGIN SANOMAT is critical of the president's 
hunger for publicity. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Unnecessary Publicity Weakens President </H5>
  President Martti Ahtisaari and his advisers are fascinated 
by 
the idea that the direct election method calls for the president 
to exercise power differently than his predecessors did, notes 
HELSINGIN SANOMAT (independent), which takes a critical view of 
what it calls Ahtisaari's regal tours through the nation. HS 
[HELSINGIN SANOMAT] points out that while of course it is good 
that the president can signal his responsiveness to the public 
through his trips around the country, it will become a problem 
if he constantly makes spontaneous offers of help right and left. 
  "And the problem will just get worse if there are many 
unresolved matters that the president is involved in one way or 
another. Then it will be hard and in the long run also 
impossible to stand above the political parties. 
  ``Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is 
in 
charge of foreign policy. That is the chief of state's most 
important task. Where domestic policy is concerned the president 
should mainly hold himself in reserve, to cite Koivisto. He 
should be ready to offer ideas in situations where the parties 
get embroiled in conflicts that cannot be resolved without 
outside mediation and an arbiter. 
  ``Resolving such problems requires a president who has a 
natural dignity with the attendant reserve of prestige. It is 
precisely this kind of thing that the public has become 
accustomed to demanding from the chief of state. In light of 
this it is rash to appear on entertainment programs on TV and 
answer serious questions that undermine the institution of the 
presidency. 
  ``One of Ahtisaari's problems is his spontaneous reaction, 
his desire to take a stand on issues and to answer when he is 
asked something. When it is used correctly, this is a good and 
important characteristic. Ahtisaari and his advisers must 
determine what kind of publicity suits the president. This 
involves solving a difficult problem: how to strike a balance 
between the institution of the presidency and the demands that a 
modern society places on public disclosure. 
  ``The president cannot make one pronouncement after another. 
That is a very short route for political actors regardless of 
their nation or era. As strange as it may seem, silence is also 
one of the president's resources, especially in the age of 
broadcast media.'' [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Risks Posed by New </F>
Presidential Role"] 
  [Text] The presidency requires a certain authority that the 
officeholder should safeguard in order to guarantee the 
confidence capital that he may need, Bjorn Mansson writes in a 
commentary on an editorial that appeared in HELSINGIN SANOMAT 
yesterday. He also discusses President Ahtisaari's travel 
schedule. 
  Yesterday our colleague, HELSINGIN SANOMAT (HS), discussed 
the risks and problems that may be associated with President 
Martti Ahtisaari's view of the presidential role (see press 
excerpt above). 
  HS is right in questioning the very basis for this view; 
that 
the fact that the president is now elected directly by the 
people fundamentally alters his role and his exercise of power. 
  Under the new election method a president must 
receive over half the votes in the second round of voting. 
However, Ahtisaari received only a quarter of the votes in the 
first "open" round, which can be compared with the fact that 
Mauno Koivisto's electoral candidates received 43 percent in 
1982 and that Koivisto won almost 50 percent of the direct votes 
in 1988! 
  Nor can Ahtisaari's "popular" mandate be regarded as 
stronger 
than that of Urho Kekkonen in 1968, for example, when his 
election alliance gathered two-thirds of the votes -- not to 
mention 1978, when they got over 80 percent! 
  On the other hand, there is nothing intrinsically wrong in 
President Ahtisaari getting out among the people once a month 
through visits to various parts of the country, even if the 
arrangement smacks of a "royal tour" and of allowing the people 
to "petition the highest authority," which belongs historically 
to the time of the monarchy. 
  But there is an inherent risk in this system that the 
citizens will get the mistaken idea that the president will set 
things right as long as he becomes acquainted with everyday 
problems out among the people. 
  Another risk, that exaggerated populism may damage the 
president's authority, is being discussed in the United States, 
where President Bill Clinton has gone in for similar "town 
meetings" with voters around the country. 
  However, HS confuses the ideas somewhat when the paper 
appears to argue that domestic trips as such lead the president 
to take more stands and answer questions. Of course the 
president can take such stands and provide answers no matter 
where he is -- for example, at regular news conferences, which 
are an inherent part of an open democracy. 
  On the other hand, HS is right in saying that it will be 
difficult in the long run if the president intervenes too much 
in controversial domestic policy issues. If he does there is a 
clear risk that he will no longer be able to stand above the 
parties and daily politics in the way the presidential role 
requires. 
  Therefore a certain restraint can be recommended, simply to 
enable the president to safeguard the confidence capital he may 
need in times of real national crisis. 
  However, we should not emulate HS and rule out the 
possibility that, for example, the national aid package for the 
European Union (EU) agreement may develop into an 
issue where the president could play a certain role in creating 
a national consensus. 
  But HS is right in saying that the president could be more 
careful about selecting the forums in which he appears. HS is 
obviously thinking of the MTV program where Ahtisaari was 
confronted with some totally disrespectful questions. However, 
that concerned fulfilling a somewhat spontaneous promise from 
the election campaign. 
  Here another parallel could be drawn with President Clinton 
who had to answer a question about what kind of underpants he 
wears on a TV program. 
  The presidency implies a certain authority that the 
officeholder should safeguard. 
  Furthermore, foreign policy is and will remain the 
president's most important domain. At present there is nothing 
to criticize, aside from the initially somewhat varied 
explanations of the notorious bandage incident [reference to 
minor injury sustained] in Stockholm. 
  It was natural that the first state visit would be to 
Sweden. 
Two neighboring countries are still awaiting their turn; Russia 
and Estonia. 
  The fact that Ahtisaari visited Iceland, the other Republic 
in the Nordic group, before the remaining monarchies has its 
natural explanation in the celebration of the 50th anniversary 
of Iceland's independence. 
  That the remaining neighbor, Norway, will have to wait until 
October, after Denmark in September, is undoubtedly more than 
"made up for" by the fact that Ahtisaari has relatives in Norway. 
  The upcoming trip to South Africa for the inauguration of 
its 
new president, Nelson Mandela, is also quite justified. Finland 
has every reason to highlight its presence at the historic event 
when South Africa's international isolation is definitively 
ended. 
  Moreover, the trip certainly fits the picture of a president 
with an international, in fact global, orientation. Ahtisaari 
has every reason to maintain the personal relations with a state 
that could play a leading role on the African continent that he 
formed during the time he was in Namibia. 
  And even though in general the prime minister should 
represent us at EU summit meetings in the future if we become a 
member, it is quite fitting that the president should also 
attend the summit on Corfu at which our EU agreement will be 
signed this summer.

"Finland's EU Membership Won't Reduce Domestic Farm Subsidies -- 
Draft of Government's Decision: 12-Billion Agriculture Package 
Next Year"] 
  [Text] The volume of Finland's farm subsidies will not be 
reduced in conjunction with European Union [EU] membership. 
About 7 billion [Finnish] markkas [FMk] a year in farm subsidies 
will be necessary even after the transition period. 
  There will, however, be a bigger bill during the first year 
of membership: About FMk12 billion will be needed for the food 
industry as well as for farming and truck farming. 
  These figures are included in the draft of the Council of 
State's decision in principle prepared for cabinet ministers by 
committees of government officials. 
  "The farm sector won't be imposing a greater burden on 
taxpayers than at present after the second year of membership," 
they estimate in the government. 
  According to the draft of the government's decision, FMk2.7 
billion in domestic subsidies will be needed for the food 
industry next year. Of that figure 2.2 billion will go toward 
compensation for the sharp drop in value of food stocks. 
  Without the subsidies to compensate for the drop in value of 
stocks, subsidies would total 1.8 billion over the five-year 
transition period for the industry, 600 million of which we will 
try to obtain from the EU. 
  No more than FMk500 million of the aid money would be used 
for research, product development, the promotion of exports, and 
marketing. A national structural subsidy of 700 million will be 
required for investments and to eliminate overproduction. 
  It is estimated that state grain reserves will account for 
FMk1.4 billion of the losses attributable to stocks. Valio, for 
example, will need 70 million for the change in the stock 
situation. 
<H5>  Farmers Compensated by Strengthening of Markka </H5>
  According to the draft, FMk5.8 billion a year of tax revenue 
will be set aside for long-term national farm and truck farm 
subsidies. EU approval will be required for these subsidies. 
  "A sufficient portion" of the 1.7-billion-markka EU farm and 
truck farm environment subsidies will be set aside "for 
especially sensitive areas and special measures." The EU will 
pay for half of these subsidies, or FMk850 million. 
  Farmers are promised compensation in the form of possible 
changes in currency exchange rates at the rate of 1 ECU = 6.30 
markkas. If the markka is strengthened by 10 percent, this will 
mean an estimated increase in value of FMk400 million. 
  Farmers are promised that compensation for vacation 
substitutes and social security will remain unchanged. At the 
present time over a billion markkas a year goes for vacation 
substitutes and a couple of billion for pensions. These 
expenditures are not included in the 12-billion package. 
  Farms would also receive compensation for marketable crops 
right from the start of membership in the EU. The lowering of 
costs in the livestock industry would be subsidized with a price 
supplement system that will, according to the decision, be 
"remarkably high," especially next year. If the EU does not 
allow it, the subsidy will be paid as a livestock subsidy. 
  To be approved annually, the price supplements for special 
crops and livestock products will be paid until 1999. A 
supplementary allowance for reducing [cultivated] surface area 
would be paid for just as long a period. The truck garden 
industry would get a separate subsidy package. 
  The government estimates that transition period subsidies 
would cost FMk3 billion the first year, 1.3 billion the second, 
and 800 million the third. The subsidies would be terminated by 
the end of the century. 
  During the transition period we would try to use the EU 
early 
retirement system to our advantage, especially as concerns the 
hog-raising and poultry industries. Furthermore, an 
interest-rate ceiling of 4 percent would be imposed on loans 
granted to farmers between 1977 and 1991. 
  Forty million markkas a year would be allocated for interest 
subsidies for truck garden enterprises and 20 million for 
abandonment [of farms] arrangements. 
  The total cost of transition period structural subsidies 
would come to from FMk200 to 500 million a year until the end of 
the century. 
<H5>  Top Tax Rate for Food Products </H5>
  A value-added tax of 22 percent would be imposed on food 
products in the model presented by government officials. The 
current sales tax is about 16 percent after the primary product 
deduction. Opportunities to provide for farmers will be 
increased, and farm property will be assessed on the basis of 
the value of the income it produces as concerns inheritance and 
gift taxes. 
  The energy tax on greenhouses would be eliminated or 
credited 
as refunds. 
  During the transition period farmers would be given the 
right 
to a retroactive deduction of the value-added tax on investment 
commodities. As concerns farmers and truck farmers' income tax, 
they could deduct half of what they owe, which exceeded 
FMk300,000 at the end of last year, over a period of five years.

<F P=106> [Article by Pentti Suominen: "EU Farm Package Will Take </F>
Billions From Taxpayers' Pocketbooks"] 
  [Text] Permanent subsidies will continue to be high even 
after the transition phase. The drop in farm product prices will 
probably be a small one in retail sales. 
  If a farmer feeds a pig throughout the fall with fodder 
bought at Finnish prices, it will not pay for him to sell the 
animal in January at European prices. 
  If a meat packer buys a pig in December at Finnish prices, 
he 
will not want to sell the ham made from it to a retail dealer at 
European prices at the start of the year. 
  Hogs, the feed they eat, and cured pork products are only 
some of the farm sector adjustment problems that have to be 
resolved before Finland -- with increasingly greater likelihood 
now -- becomes a full-fledged member of the European Union (EU) 
at the start of next year. 
  To resolve these problems, the government and officials are 
putting together a subsidy package that will pay out billions of 
[Finnish] markkas [FMk], the cost of which both the EU and above 
all Finnish taxpayers will share in. 
  The first draft of the package, produced largely by the 
officials, was made public during the week that is now ending 
and immediately gave rise to heated discussion. The big stir 
over it is only expected to get worse before the government 
approves it by 26 May at the latest, according to what Prime 
Minister Esko Aho promises. 
  According to the broadest-based estimates, during Finland's 
first year as a member of the EU, 1995, subsidies to be 
disbursed out of domestic tax revenue would come to over FMk17 
billion. The lowest estimates result in totals of well over 
FMk10 billion. 
<H5>  6,800 Markkas per Taxpayer </H5>
  If the figure comes to 17 billion, each of Finland's over 
2.5 
million national income taxpayers would have to pay FMk6,800 
next year to support the farm sector. If the figure were 12 
billion, the cost incurred by each taxpayer would be FMk4,800. 
  This would mean that the cost of maintaining our farm sector 
would account for from about 13 to 19 percent of what the 
average wage earner pays in taxes. According to the most recent 
statistics -- for 1992 -- compiled by the Taxpayers Association, 
taxes came to FMk36,575 per wage earner. 
  The problems attributable to the transition period alluded 
to 
above in the example of the pig will increase the size of the 
subsidy package next year. In addition to the farm sector per 
se, the food industry will also come in for its share of the 
transition period subsidies. 
  According to reports that have been published, subsidies to 
be received by the food industry during the transition period 
would come to nearly FMk2.7-3 billion and most of that, 2.2 
billion, would be to compensate the industry for the drop in 
value of its stocks. 
  Subsidies designed to compensate the farm sector proper for 
additional costs during the transition period would, according 
to reports that have appeared in the press, amount to from over 
FMk3 billion to nearly FMk4 billion. 
  The EU is expected to contribute only somewhat more than 
FMk100 million to the subsidies that go to the food industry, 
but it is supposed to disburse over FMk1.5 billion in subsidies 
to the farm sector. 
  The reports published on transition period subsidies, 
considered by wage earners to be large ones, immediately gave 
rise to criticism. 
  From the standpoint of the end result, how the subsidies 
evolve over the long term is perhaps more important. 
  In connection with the decision on the EU, there was a great 
deal of talk about structural changes in the farm sector and 
about how the subsidies, which are viewed as being too high, 
could be reduced as the farm population decreases. The reports 
on the subsidy package that have been published are producing 
disappointment. 
<H5>  Permanent Farm Subsidies Would Continue To Be High </H5>
  Permanent subsidies would also continue to be high. The 
Finnish taxpayer's share of their cost would in future be about 
FMk5.8 billion, whereas it is currently about FMk0.4 billion 
less than that. 
  The EU's share of the permanent subsdidies totaling about 
FMk9.3 billion would be 3.5 billion at the most. The purpose of 
the subsidies is to help plug the FMk9.5 billion gap in farm 
income there will be when producer prices fall to European 
levels at the start of next year. 
  The goal is to cover the remaining shortfall of nearly FMk6 
billion little by little over the years with the aid of cost 
reductions, changes in the competition situation, structural 
development, and apparently also tax breaks. 
  There is no change in the offing as concerns the possibility 
that revenue from Finnish taxpayers would in future pay for 
farmer pensions amounting to a couple of billion markkas a year, 
the FMk1.1 billion cost of providing vacation substitutes for 
farmers, and FMk0.9 billion for administrative, advisory, 
research, and other expenses. 
  On the other hand, the tax system may be changed such that 
farmers would not have to pay any taxes at all over the next few 
years. Some people think that this is what will happen if the 
government approves a reorganization program whereby farmers 
could deduct half of their debts over FMk300,000 from their 
taxable income during the next five years. 
  This would also mean subsidies involving billions since, 
according to the Taxpayers Association, the farm economy paid a 
total of nearly FMk3.3 billion in taxes in 1992, even though the 
tax paid by an individual farmer was less than 20,000. 
  The FMk9.5 billion drop in producer prices will mean a drop 
of nearly 40 percent in income composed of farm sales prices and 
subsidies, which amounts to FMk25 billion when production costs 
and taxes have not been deducted from it. 
  Farm product prices would not, however, drop as much as that 
in retail sales. It is estimated that the real drop in prices 
will only amount to less than 10 percent. Dairy product prices, 
for example, are expected to rise. 
  The reasons for the slight drop in prices are trade and the 
tax assessor. 
  Food sales amount to from FMk60 to 70 billion a year and the 
imminent drop in producer prices will account for only 12-15 
percent of that. If nothing else changes, the drop in prices 
could be that great too. 
  However, the government is planning to replace the current 
16-percent sales tax with Europe's higher 22-percent value-added 
tax.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Navy Demands More Vessels"] </F>
  [Text] The planned expansion of the territorial waters 
means that the Navy will call for considerably more resources. 
Rear Admiral Sakari Visa, the naval commander, indicated in an 
interview on Sunday [8 May] with TURUN SANOMAT that the new sea 
regions cannot be monitored effectively without additional 
resources. 
  According to Visa, the Navy's greatest need is for four or 
five new patrol boats and new fixed materiel. Finland must also 
acquire submarines. Visa believes that if Finland had a 
submarine flotilla of its own, it would be much easier to patrol 
sea areas and to raise the threshold for border violations. 
  But submarines are not at the top of the Navy's wish list, 
according to Visa. 
  Several weeks ago, in one of its evening sessions, the 
government decided in principle to expand the territorial 
boundary from the present 4 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. 
According to plans, the parliament will be presented with a 
proposal on this matter as early as this month. Rear Adm. Visa 
points out that, despite this decision, the Navy has not been 
promised any more ships or personnel. In the TURUN SANOMAT 
interview, Visa also pointed out that Finnish membership in the 
European Union [EU] would place new demands on border monitoring 
and on the defense in general, since Finland's boundaries would 
then be the outer boundaries of the Union, as well.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Grachev's Threats Leveled Against Estonia Are </F>
Completely Out of Line"] 
  [Text] It appears to be hard for Russian Minister of 
Defense Pavel Grachev to remember that Estonia is once again an 
independent nation and a member of the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and the Council of Europe. Grachev is still prepared to threaten 
to send additional troops to Estonia very quickly if "the 
situation changes." 
  By a change in the situation Grachev apparently means a 
possible worsening of the status of Russians living in Estonia 
if the negotiations between the two countries end in a deadlock. 
The threat of sending more troops may be intended as a last 
resort. The chief way of stepping up the pressure appears to be 
keeping the slightly less than 2,500 Russian soldiers who are 
still in Estonia in that country until the problem of the status 
of the retired Soviet Army officers is resolved. 
  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has made an effort to appear 
to be more conciliatory and denies that the two issues are 
officially linked with one another. All the same, an unofficial 
connection does exist. Nor is this the first time either that 
Grachev has given voice to more hawklike interpretations of 
Russian policy than Kozyrev or President Boris Yeltsin. 
Unfortunately, in light of past experience, this does not give 
us the right to underestimate the importance of the content of 
the defense minister's statements. Grachev's stance just seems 
to be getting firmer. 
  The threat Grachev leveled against Estonia "in passing" got 
President Lennart Meri to cut short his trip abroad. Outwardly, 
this seems to be an undue overdramatization of the situation, 
but it also reflects the increasingly more tense atmosphere of 
the negotiations between Estonia and Russia. 
  The Estonians are indignant with the West because it, along 
with the leaders of the United States, Germany, Great Britain, 
and Sweden, strongly pressured Latvia into accepting an 
agreement negotiated with Russia, an agreement the signing of 
which had been postponed on several occasions. The agreement 
ensures that those Russian soldiers remaining in Latvia will be 
repatriated by the end of August, but, in the opinion of the 
Estonians, it contains completely unreasonable concessions to 
Russia. 
  Latvia agreed to guarantee residence permits to over 20,000 
retired former Soviet Army officers. They may also retain their 
homes, but Russia will pay their pensions. For perfectly good 
reasons, Estonia fears that Russia will demand that it consent 
to a similar agreement. And worse yet, Estonia fears that the 
West will assume the same position. In Estonia's opinion, this 
is an impossible demand. 
  At least at this point, Estonia appears to be sticking to 
its 
guns. The negotiations have become practically deadlocked. 
Estonia is relying on the fact that pressure from the West will 
in any case force Russia to repatriate the remaining soldiers by 
the target deadline, the end of August. Estonia is, of course, 
right in maintaining that concessions cannot be required of it 
to remove foreign troops from the country. 
  However, it may be assumed that Estonia takes a serious view 
of the problems arising with regard to the status of the Russian 
population residing in the country. Among them is the dispute 
over the status of retired Russian officers. Russia must make 
compromises with its demands, but Estonia too is going to have 
to be willing to make some concessions. Inflexibility will only 
stir up Moscow's hawks.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today briefed 
President Konstandinos Karamanlis on foreign policy issues, 
particularly the progress of our national issues, as well as on 
the results of his recent visit to Moscow. After the meeting, 
Papoulias told correspondents that the president has a personal 
interest in the issues they discussed. 
  Furthermore, Papoulias said the latest scenarios about a 
double or triple name for Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM] are not realistic. He added that the 
Greek side does not have any particular expectations from the 
visit of U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz. The U.S. 
President's special envoy, Papoulias said, came to Greece to 
sound out the Greek Government and relay its views on the 
national issue to Skopje. On Nimetz's visit, Papoulias said: 
When there is a negotiation on some ideas, there should be an 
effort by the negotiators. This is logical. If this effort 
were at a standstill, then Nimetz would not have come to Athens. 
  Papoulias concluded by saying that he will be holding a news 
conference after his meeting with Nimetz to provide more details 
on the issue.

  [Text] Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. President's special envoy 
on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
came to Athens today with no new ideas. The U.S. official had a 
meeting with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias this evening 
that lasted for one and a half hours. Nimetz will go to Skopje 
tomorrow. 
  [Begin Foivos Karzis recording] Foreign Minister Papoulias 
and U.S. Presidential Envoy Nimetz had a meeting of a rather 
exploratory nature this evening, in view of the new round of 
contacts in New York. Nimetz confirmed that he was not bringing 
any new ideas. On the other hand, Papoulias expressed the view 
that the meeting between Nimetz and [FYROM President] Kiro 
Gligorov tomorrow in Skopje will be important. The possibility 
that Nimetz will return to Athens after his contacts with the 
Skopjean leadership remains open. In that case, Papoulias said, 
we will have a clearer picture of the situation. 
  Papoulias expressed the hope that the meetings he and [FYROM 
Foreign Minister] Stevo Crvenkovski will have with Cyrus Vance 
and Nimetz in New York between 14 and 17 June will be the final 
round of deliberations on the Skopje issue. In any case, it is 
indicative that Nimetz's agenda this time was clearly more 
limited, as he did not meet with Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou or Yeoryios Papandreou, deputy foreign minister in 
charge of Greek-American relations. This morning, Papoulias 
briefed President Konstandinos Karamanlis on the developments in 
the national issues and described the scenarios of a triple name 
for Skopje as unrealistic. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] For the second time, Greece has blocked European 
Union [EU] aid to Albania. National Economy Minister Ioannis 
Papandoniou refused to give a positive vote to the demand for 
economic support worth ECU 35 million, which the EU Commission 
again brought to ECOFIN [EU Council of Finance Ministers]. In 
Athens, the Foreign Ministry spokesman repeated that Albania's 
relations with the EU depend on respect for human rights.

    [Editorial Report] The results of a March poll conducted by 
the ALKO organization on behalf of the SKY radio station 
appeared in the 22 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI. Respondents 
were asked whether the present Panhellenic Socialist Movement 
[PASOK] government's image is better or worse than that of the 
previous New Democracy [ND]. Some 36.6 percent thought it 
better, while 28.8 percent considered it worse. Another 30.7 
percent thought it is the same, and 3.9 percent did not know or 
did not answer. The next question centered on whether the 
government is trusted to confront the current economic crisis 
and was asked over several consecutive months. In December 1993, 
positive answers amounted to 23.6 percent, compared with 37.8 
percent negative answers and 38.7 percent who did not know or 
who thought it was too early to judge. The percentages for 30-31 
March were 39.6 percent positive, 53.9 percent negative, and 4.5 
percent who did not know. On 8-9 April, there were 43.3 percent 
positive answers, 52 percent negative ones, and 4.2 percent who 
did not know. Finally, on 9-10 May, 33.7 percent said they 
trusted the government, compared with 64.6 percent who said they 
did not, and 1.7 percent who did not know. 
  A 16 March MARTEL poll asked respondents to indicate which, 
in their opinion, is the government's principal quality. Some 
27.4 percent chose simply the fact that the present government 
is better than the previous one. A total of 18.2 percent said 
that it is "moderate," 10.0 percent thought that it conducts a 
"successful foreign policy," and 7.6 percent that it is 
"socially just." Some 4 percent thought that its economic policy 
inspires trust, 21.5 percent said that the government possesses 
no special attributes, and 11.3 percent did not know. 
  Another question centered on the popularity of political 
leaders. ND leader Miltiadhis Evert had a positive balance of 11 
percent, followed by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou with a 
positive balance of 9 percent, and Coalition of the Left for 
Progress leader Nikos Konstandopoulos with 2 percent. On the 
contrary, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras had a negative 
balance of 11 percent and Communist Party [KKE] leader Aleka 
Papariga a negative balance of 46 percent.

    [Editorial Report] The Greek press reacted to the 
appointment of Yiannos Papandoniou as minister of national 
economy following the death of his predecessor Yiorgos 
Yennimatas. 
  Opposition New Democracy [ND] leader Miltiadhis Evert was 
notified first about the impending appointment of Papandoniou as 
minister of national economy, a move that augurs well for the 
government treating the opposition with respect, according to 
Nikos Nikolaou, writing in the 8 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS 
KIRIAKIS. Evert was told even before Bank of Greece governor 
Ioannis Boutos, who had been angling for the position. 
Explanations vary as to why Boutos lost out, Nikolaou reported. 
According to one version, certain Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement [PASOK] officials took advantage of the poor reception 
the Bank of Greece's annual financial report was given in the 
mass media to represent him to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
as a "monetarist," a "rightist radical," and a minister who 
would adopt harsh economic measures liable to cause public 
resentment against the government. According to Nikolaou, 
Papandreou decided against Boutos because he needed Boutos at 
the Bank of Greece, which has had an increasing role in 
financial and foreign exchange policy, particularly as the 1 
July deadline approaches for the freeing of capital movement. 
Greece's European Union [EU] partners also appreciate the fact 
that the nonpartisan Boutos is at the helm of the country's 
principal financial institution. Still another reason, Nikolaou 
observed, is that the appointment of Boutos, who enjoys the 
confidence of Brussels but is considered an "outsider" in PASOK 
because of his ND past, was viewed with distrust by PASOK trade 
union leaders fearful of his economic policies. In contrast, 
Papandoniou, whose views and economic remedies are similar to 
Boutos', is a longtime PASOK official and central committee 
member who can implement the necessary economic measures without 
angering PASOK trade unionists, Nikolaou contended. 
  Papandoniou is "young, handsome, well-educated, and liked by 
both the business establishment and trade union leaders," 
Nikolaou continued. While these attributes are "indispensable," 
they are not enough, he claimed, for he also needs the kind of 
leadership style possessed by former Ministers of National 
Economy Yerasimos Arsenis and Kostas Simitis. Nikolaou, who 
holds that the Ministry of National Economy should play an 
essentially coordinating role, questioned whether Papandoniou 
would be able to exert control over, and coordinate, such 
diverse officials as PASOK secretary general Akis 
Tsokhatzopoulos, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis, 
Minister of Labor Evangelos Yiannopoulos, and Minister of 
Industry Kostas Simitis. Only the ability to do so will ensure 
the success of his ministry, Nikolaou concluded. 
  According to a brief article in the 8 May Athens daily I 
KATHIMERINI citing "informed sources," Boutos was not "unhappy" 
about losing out to Papandoniou. Despite the fact that until a 
few days before Papandoniou's appointment Boutos was still the 
"favorite" in the race, the governor of the Bank of Greece was 
not prepared to follow, as national economy minister, a course 
at variance with the policies he advocates in his present 
position, the paper said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that the UN 
secretary general's Cyprus report is prejudiced. 
  Cetin was replying to reporters' questions at Ankara 
Esenboga 
Airport on his return from visits to Ukraine and Moldova last 
night. He stressed that a forced solution will never be accepted 
in Cyprus. He added: The UN attitude is one of forcing one of 
the sides -- the Turkish Cypriot side -- to accept the package 
the other side accepts. A forced solution will never be 
accepted. In that case, there would be no solution. 
  Cetin stressed that the fact that there exist two sides on 
the island must be accepted. He pointed out that Denktas' 
contribution in turning the Vienna talks into a forward step is 
an important development.

  [Text] Ankara -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry confirmed 
reports that Turkey was setting up a logistic support center in 
the eastern city of Erzurum for international monitors of the 
Azeri-Armenian conflict. 
  However, a Foreign Ministry spokesman hastened to add that 
this was in no way a "base" but merely a logistical support 
center. 
  Spokesman Ferhat Ataman's clarification follows claims in 
some of the newspapers that the new structure would be a "second 
Poised Hammer" -- a similar structure to the ones set up by 
United States, France, and Britain for protecting the Kurds in 
northern Iraq. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said Tuesday [31 May] that the 
force was important for the monitoring of a cease-fire. 
  "It is important that peace efforts are made under a CSCE 
umbrella on a multinational basis," she told Parliament members 
of her True Path Party. 
  "Preparations are under way for a logistic support center in 
Erzurum for the use of international monitors to be sent to the 
region of conflict," she said. 
  Erzurum is eastern Turkey's major city closest to the 
Armenian border. 
  Turkey is a member of the Minsk group of 11 nations working 
to resolve the six-year-old Azeri-Armenian conflict over the 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, most Armenian populated but 
technically ruled by Baku. 
  Armenian forces that have taken all of Karabakh have in the 
last year seized 20 percent of Azeri lands proper, forcing about 
1 million Azeris into refugee camps. 
  Turkey sides with fellow-Muslim and ethnic kin in Azerbaijan 
urging an end to fighting and a withdrawal of Armenian forces 
from Azeri territory. 
  Ataman, meanwhile, said earlier reports that Azerbaijan had 
attacked the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan were unconfirmed. "We 
have checked the speculations and apparently, there was some 
firing at the border, but there is no Armenian gain of 
territory," Ataman said. 
  Turkey says it has the right of guarantee over this enclave 
at its border. Asked what Turkey would do in case of an 
Armenian attack, Ataman said: "We have made our point known. 
There is no change in that." 
  Ankara has said in the past that it would not tolerate an 
Armenian attack on Nakhichevan.

his Ankara contacts and left for Istanbul. He was seen off at 
Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. In an 
airport statement, Cetin said that hopeful decisions on 
promoting bilateral relations were made during Sunsiri's visit. 
Recalling that the Turkish Airlines has three weekly flights to 
Bangkok, Cetin added that they have agreed to increase the 
number of flights. He noted that decisions have also been 
reached to bring together the private sectors, especially the 
contracting sectors, of the two countries and to continue 
high-level visits within this framework. Cetin said: 
  [Begin Cetin recording] We believe that if Turkish manpower, 
development potential, and experience are combined with the 
technology, the rapid development rate, and market quests of 
Asian countries, both sides can benefit from the results. No 
doubt, within this framework, Thailand is an important country 
in its region. Our cooperation with Thailand will greatly 
contribute to Turkey's cooperation with that region. [end 
recording] 
  Sunsiri said his visit has been beneficial for bilateral 
relations. He added that during his contacts an agreement was 
also reached to hold the Turkish-Thai joint economic committee 
meeting in Turkey this year. Sunsiri will leave Turkey this 
evening.

<F P=106> ["The World Today" column by Ali Sirmen: "An Important </F>
Proposal"] 
  [Excerpts] The visit to Israel by a Turkish parliamentary 
delegation, headed by Erdal Inonu, can contribute significantly 
to developing relations between Israel and Turkey. In addition 
to delegation members being who they are -- Erdal Inonu and 
other members such as Mr. Ismet Sezgin -- the fact that meetings 
will be held with Yitzhak Rabin warrants looking forward to 
important results from this visit. 
  Undoubtedly the positive developments in Turkish-Israeli 
relations are favorable to both countries. 
  The most important factor that effects relations developing 
like this is that Israel is no longer the greatest element of 
instability and obstacle to peace in the region. [passage 
omitted] 
  Unfortunately, Israel no longer being a risk factor was not 
sufficient to create a favorable and auspicious atmosphere in 
the region, not where the future or Turkey's relations with 
regional countries is concerned. Because, this time new threat 
centers and points of conflict have emerged, and others will be 
added in the future. 
  Countries under radical Arab administrations are posing a 
big 
threat for Turkey in the region. These countries try to export 
their ideologies at each opportunity and spend great funds 
toward this end. Inevitably Iran, though not an Arab country, 
is included in this category. 
  On the other hand, we cannot ignore our southern neighbor 
Syria's perpetual initiatives directed at creating instability 
in our country. [passage omitted] 
  For this reason, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
proposal [as published] envisaging Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian 
cooperation and forming a common front against terrorism gains a 
more important dimension. 
  It has to be pointed out immediately that Rabin's proposal 
has to be carefully discussed, closely scrutinized, and 
meticulously implemented. The reason being that fundamentalist 
and ethnic terrorism is threatening the regimes of all these 
three countries. 
  For years now, it has been Arab countries, wanting to export 
their structure and expecting support from ethnic terrorism, 
which have been a source of danger and terrorism for Turkey and 
not Israel, which was once considered a threat. 
  In this situation, it is meaningless to bury our head in 
sand 
and be foolishly deceived by the intentional propaganda of the 
supporters of religious laws. It is not Zionist ideology that 
threatens Turkey but rather Arab ideology. 
  The situation being as it is, the reasons for considering 
Rabin's proposal seriously are obvious.

  [Text] Given the opposition she receives from a wide 
spectrum, Turkey's first female prime minister may easily claim 
to be today's political leader enjoying the least support from 
her country. Apart from the anticipated criticism from the 
opposition parties, her standing with the constitutionally 
neutral president, the powerful businessmen's lobby, TUSIAD, her 
junior coalition partner, SHP [Social Democrat People's Party], 
and even her own party, appears to be deteriorating. 
  Despite her calls for a consensus on a war of economic 
salvation, opposition against her is growing visibly, fed with 
allegations of mismanagement and even corruption. 
  Does anyone support Ciller, who came to power a year ago 
with 
promises of change? 
  The Association of Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen 
(TUSIAD) does not. The prime minister, who once referred to the 
members of the lobby as "traitors," has already burned her 
bridges. 
  President Suleyman Demirel, who drew Ciller into political 
life as his protegee, has been angered by her efforts to put the 
blame for the economic difficulties on the previous government, 
which was under his own leadership. 
  She has also started a serious controversy with the 
president 
with her calls for extending the term of Chief of Staff Dogan 
Gures. 
  Despite the displeasure shown by political circles at 
"alternative government formulas," including a scenario that 
involves the formation of a government by a team of technocrats 
-- a throwback to 1971 -- some True Path deputies continue their 
opposition to Ciller. Allegations about the involvement of her 
husband in state affairs further fuelled tensions, as well as 
the ambiguous financing of her trip to the United States for the 
graduation of her son. A schematic look at the mounting 
opposition reveals the following highlights: 
<H5>  Mother Path Formula </H5>
  Following the 27 March local elections, business circles 
represented by TUSIAD met with opposition leader Mesut Yilmaz, 
to feel his pulse on a "Mother Path" coalition between his 
Motherland Party and Ciller's True Path. Yilmaz, who has 
habitually advocated a Mother Path coalition on the condition 
that Ciller leaves the party leadership, interpreted the move as 
a signal for fiercer opposition to Ciller, calling her "a 
finished-off prime minister." But he maintained that they would 
form a coalition if she left her post. 
  Yilmaz also disclosed that business circles, who had been 
warm at first toward Ciller's April 5 package, now wanted him to 
"topple the government." 
  "They think Ciller should resign right away. Each day she is 
in office costs the nation three months," Yilmaz said. 
"Considering the mess she has made, it would be better that 
some one who was not an economics professor was prime minister." 
But he also allowed that he was powerless to topple Ciller. 
"This should be done by the True Path deputies," he said. 
Yilmaz's call did not fall on deaf ears. Two True Path 
deputies, Koksal Toptan and Ibrahim Gurdal, said Ciller's 
resignation would be the "best thing that could be done for 
Turkey." Koksal advocated the Mother Path coalition. 
<H5>  TUSIAD and Treason </H5>
  Ciller, defending her package, said that business circles 
were against it because it had not been in their interests. 
"Not supporting this package would be treason," she said, 
adding insult to injury. 
  TUSIAD's answer was no milder than the prime minister's 
remark. The association, which has a long tradition of severe 
opposition to governments (it had taken newspaper ads to 
criticize Ecevit government in the pre-1980 era) this time used 
the television. TUSIAD Chairman Halis Komili said there were two 
keys to escaping from the economic crisis in the country -- the 
meticulous implementation of decisions, and confidence. "The 
government has lost on both counts. It gives no confidence and 
has no credibility," he said. 
  Within 10 days, Osman Unsal, the undersecretary of Treasury 
whom Ciller called "half of her brain," quit his job. 
<H5>  Gures Crisis </H5>
  Ciller received another setback when her conversation with 
two of her ministers on extending the term of Dogan Gures was 
leaked. Demirel fervently opposed the idea, saying the decision 
was anyway his. Ciller, however, maintained that it was 
entirely up to her to extend the term or not. The debate ended 
with Gures' own remarks: "This is no time for heroism nor 
gracious gestures. When the time comes, one has to transfer 
one's duties to someone else proudly." Gures said a week later 
that he would be resigning on September 1. But Demirel's 
insistence that Ciller should see "whether she can extend the 
term" created some serious discord between Demirel and Ciller, 
which was displayed in Ciller's pointed absence from the 
ceremony to see Demirel off on his trip to Egypt. 
  Meanwhile, Yilmaz accused Ciller of trying to draw the 
Turkish Armed Forces into a political debate. 
<H5>  Ozer Ciller Controversy </H5>
  "Wherever I dig, out pops Ozer Ciller," complained Ekrem 
Pakdemirli, the vice chairman of the Motherland, who deals with 
economics. 
  Ozer Ciller's yacht, claimed to be worth TL [Turkish lira] 
30 
billion, was also used by Yilmaz: "Will those who cruise around 
in billion-lira yachts save the people who are stricken by 
poverty?" he asked. 
  Ciller's own party adopted a similar line: "I wish we could 
take you out in disguise, so you can see the queues for bread," 
Irfan Koksalan, True Path's Ankara deputy, said in a party group 
meeting. "The present situation is due to inefficiency. People 
curse you and the True Path." 
  Koksalan also targeted Ozer Ciller, saying he should not 
allow himself to be pictured in luxurious yachts. "It is 
claimed that your husband is influential in the appointment of 
bureaucrats and even ministers. You are the prime minister, 
give him a ministerial post and let's stop the allegations," he 
told Ciller. 
  The prime minister, who took the rostrum after those 
remarks, 
defended Ozer Ciller. "The yacht is not new. We bought it long 
ago, but repaired it recently, so he can get some sea air. Is 
this a crime?" She was quoted as saying. "It is only worth 
one-tenth of the amount that is claimed." 
  But according to press reports, Ciller gave her ministers a 
good scolding, accusing them of "not rising to the defense of 
Ozer Ciller." A daily claimed that Ciller charged the ministers 
of being glued to their chairs and red-plated cars. "But no one 
is indispensable," she allegedly hinted. 
  The press was not spared Ciller's harsh words for their 
articles about her husband. "You have criticized him in 
everything. He could not even talk to friends. He cannot go 
out. Should he just play around to pass the time?" she told a 
group of journalists from HURRIYET. 
<H5>  Blame-Throwing Game </H5>
  Ciller's less-than-constructive statements, coupled with her 
repeated attempts to lay the blame for the economic crisis on 
the previous government, sent True Path delegates to President 
Demirel. A subtle change was seen in the attitude of the 
president, who had generally refrained from criticizing the 
prime minister. 
  Demirel drew attention to the fact that Ciller had been the 
state minister responsible from the economy in the previous 
government. "If someone has been in power for 11 months, 
wouldn't other people ask her what she has been doing during 
that time?" Demirel said in an interview. 
  Demirel's criticism continued. "There is always the 
possibility of resignation," he said, implying, too, that Ciller 
could have resigned from the past government if she did not like 
the policies adopted. 
  He also took a tough stance against attempts to get the 
military involved in politics. "Whoever wants to use the 
military as a means of support will regret the day he was born," 
he said. 
<H5>  The Bill for U.S. Trip </H5>
  The latest controversy to appear is over who would foot the 
bill for Ciller's "private visit" to the United States in which 
she was to attend her son's graduation ceremony. 
  The Prime Minister created much speculation by taking a 
large 
delegation of advisors, although she claimed the visit to be 
private. She defended herself by saying that the group of 
advisers, including her foreign policy adviser Volkan Vural, 
would have "gone anyway." While the opposition and members of 
her party criticized the visit, True Path Deputy Esat 
Kiratlioglu said since she was the prime minister, "she could do 
whatever she liked." 
  "She is not the woman next door, she is our prime minister. 
Of course the state will foot the bill" he said. 
  Ciller ended the controversy with a statement saying that 
she 
would pay the whole bill herself, including the cost of the 10 
rooms being kept empty on the floor of her Boston hotel.

  [Text] Ankara -- Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman Mesut 
Yilmaz and Welfare Party (RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan made a 
crucial step on Wednesday [1 June] and discussed strategies for 
the toppling of the coalition government led by Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller. After the meeting, Yilmaz said that he and 
Erbakan had exchanged their views at a time when the government 
was weak. The RP leader, however, said that they had discussed 
how to eliminate the current mismanagement. 
  The two leaders met in Yilmaz's office in Parliament 
following Erbakan's request for an appointment on Tuesday night. 
The chairmen agreed to adopt a joint stance against the 
coalition government's democratization package, which includes 
constitutional amendments. This situation has dashed the hope of 
the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's Party 
(SHP), which gives utmost importance to the package. Since at 
least 300 votes are necessary for constitutional change, the 
coalition government, which has a total of 233 votes, has 
suffered a terrible blow, as it now seems unlikely that these 
changes will materialize. 
  The fact that ANAP and the RP oppose the democratization 
package, which the SHP claims is the "only reason" why it has 
stayed in government, has put even the near future of the 
government at stake. At present, ANAP has 100 seats and the RP 
has 39 seats in Parliament. 
  Despite the outside support of the Nationalist Movement 
Party 
(MHP), the coalition parties have lost their chance to acquire 
the necessary 300 votes. After his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan 
spoke at his party's parliamentary group meeting. Noting that 
although ANAP and the RP had a total of 139 votes, there were 
more than 190 deputies who shared their views. "Those deputies 
are ready to topple the present government. Our colleagues in 
the DYP [True Path Party] and the SHP should help us in this," 
Erbakan said. 
  Erbakan said that the government was trying to alter 
Turkey's 
agenda through the democratization package that was, to all 
intents and purposes, inadequate. He said that even Mumtaz 
Soysal from the SHP, professor of constitutional law, had 
described the package as such. 
  Erbakan said his belief that Turkey needed a new government 
in order to overcome the existing situation had been supported 
by Yilmaz. 
  Before his meeting with Yilmaz, Erbakan held "secret 
meetings" with some ANAP deputies, including Sadi Pehlivanoglu. 
The joint stance of the opposition parties and the intraparty 
conflicts within the coalition parties are expected to add to 
the speculation regarding the life span of the government.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "The Very Poor State of the </F>
Press"] 
  [Text] Recently, we published an exclusive report on the 
state of the press in Turkey and we listed the facts of the 
sorrowful situation in our country. After our report was 
published, we were flooded with calls both from the press bosses 
and from our readers. We were congratulated by the public for 
our bold stand while some newspaper publishers complained that 
the report did not represent the facts. 
  We had said the newspaper in Turkey had turned into a "state 
press" because all the leading papers were receiving state 
assistance. Some publishers strongly disputed this and said 
their editorial policies had reflected a pro-state stance simply 
because Turkey was going through hard times and they felt they 
had to defend the government "as we are all in the same boat." 
  Last week the public was shocked when it was revealed that 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller issued a new memorandum to state 
banks that all the advertisement they gave would be subject to 
the approval of the prime minister. So the prime minister will 
serve as an official advertising agency. Beyond that it became 
public that with such an application the prime minister is 
admitting she has created a state press that will receive its 
advertising money straight from her. 
  So whoever is pro-government can get ads from the state 
banks 
but if you speak the truth and try to correct the ills of the 
country then you will face a boycott from the prime minister. 
We have seen all this too many times before and they have never 
succeeded. What is said is that now the leading newspapers with 
the exception of SABAH (because we have seen in the past few 
weeks that the paper does not run front page advertisements of 
state banks) are all running ads of state banks on the 
right-hand bottom corners of their front pages and thus the 
prime minister's memorandum has cast a shadow on their editorial 
policies. 
  It is hard to understand why the prime minister issued such 
a 
memorandum and by doing so admitted her guilt of trying to 
control the newspapers. She was already providing heavy 
subsidies to the press that support her. She was giving them 
incentives and advertisements especially by state banks. So why 
make it all public? 
  No wonder our press is being described as a "state press" 
abroad and among diplomats in Turkey. What a great shame.

  [Text] While the total popular support behind the ruling 
coalition parties, the True Path Party (DYP) and the Social 
Democrat People's Party (SHP), was 35 percent during the local 
elections which were held two months ago, it has become apparent 
that currently only 17.4 percent of the people are happy with 
the performance of the DYP-SHP coalition government. 
  A public poll conducted by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS among 
2,184 
people in city squares of Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya and 
Bursa according to random sampling showed that 79.4 percent of 
the people are not pleased with the Tansu Ciller government; 
however, they are undecided about President Suleyman Demirel's 
interventions. While 51.6 percent of the interviewed said they 
agreed with the criticisms which Demirel directed against Ciller 
and the government, 51.8 percent said they did not think it 
necessary for Demirel to be a more active president. One of the 
interviewed citizens expressed his view by saying: "Demirel's 
statements are correct. However, if he knew everything that 
well, why did he give up the office of prime minister then?" 
<H5>  Questions-Answers </H5>
  Four separate questions which can be answered either "yes" 
or 
"no" were asked of 2,184 people who are eligible voters and who 
were selected at random in five metropolitan cities. The 
questions asked and the replies received are as follows: 
  Question 1: Does Demirel remain within the limits of the 
Constitution as he fulfills his presidential duties? Yes--941 
(43.1 percent), No--1121 (51.3 percent), No comment--122 (5.6 
percent). 
  Question 2: Do you agree with the criticisms which Demirel 
directs against Ciller and her Cabinet as president? Yes--1124 
(51.5 percent), No--981 (44.9 percent), No comment--79 (3.6). 
  Question 3: Do you think it is necessary for Demirel to be a 
more active president under these conditions? 
  Yes--960 (43.9 percent), No--1131 (51.8 percent), No 
comment--93 (4.6 percent). 
  Question 4: Are you pleased with the performance which the 
DYP-SHP coalition government has shown under Tansu Ciller's 
leadership? 
  Yes--380 (17.4 percent), No--1734 (79.4 percent), No 
comment--70 (3.2 percent). 
  The following are some of the interesting reasons which some 
citizens gave for their answers: 
  "Demirel is not sincere when he criticizes Tansu Ciller, 
whom 
he introduces as `his daughter.'" 
  "It is enough if Demirel is just active on the secularism 
issue." 
  "The DYP-SHP coalition under Demirel's leadership was 
better." "Ciller acts her own way no matter how much Demirel 
criticizes her." 
  "They all look alike, God damn it." "It is Demirel who is 
responsible for all that has happened because it was he who 
introduced Mrs. Ciller." 
  "All that Demirel has said is correct. Well, if he knew that 
much, why did he quit his post as prime minister then?" "Demirel 
is justified in his criticisms, but a president should not 
interfere in everything." 
  "Demirel is now doing everything that he criticized the late 
President Turgut Ozal for." 
  "With the exception of terrorism, the Ciller government has 
not been successful in any issue."

<F P=106> [Responses by French President Francois Mitterrand and </F>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to written questions from Dieter 
Schroeder and Serge July; received on 2 and 3 June: "Kohl and 
Mitterrand -- a Shared European Belief To Guarantee Peace"] 
  [Text] To mark the 6 June ceremonies, LIBERATION and the 
leading Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG requested and were 
granted a "three-way" interview with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
President Francois Mitterrand. It was initially planned that 
they would answer the questions asked by our editors Dieter 
Schroeder and Serge July during the Mulhouse summit on 30 May. 
However, because the two men could not fit it into their 
schedules, the Mulhouse interview could not go ahead. We 
therefore sent our questions to the offices of both leaders and 
received our replies on 2 and 3 June. 
  [LIBERATION] The world is currently commemorating the 
anniversary of one of the major military events of the century 
that came one year before the fall of Nazism. What are your 
feelings as you witness the ceremonies being held on the beaches 
of Normandy? 
  [Mitterrand] This year's Normandy landings ceremonies are 
particularly solemn since we are celebrating their jubilee. 
Exactly 50 years ago, an immense fleet bearing the colors of 
liberty and democracy returned hope and dignity to the people of 
France. The feelings anyone can have on such a day are 
appreciation of the nations which took part in this 
extraordinary uprising against Nazism, feelings of admiration 
for the leaders who organized and successfully conducted 
operations of this scale, and finally feelings of deep gratitude 
to the courageous men, many of whom sacrificed their lives, who 
set foot on Norman soil on that day. 
  It is natural that those who were the main participants or 
witnesses of these events, or those who remain after 50 years, 
should want to meet again and pause to reflect at the place 
where they lived this episode in history. These are feelings 
that everyone can understand. The only purpose of the 
ceremonies of 6 June is to respond to this quite legitimate 
desire. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you regret not being able to attend? 
  [Kohl] Of course not. While everyone has quite naturally 
claimed the opposite, I at no time requested an invitation, 
because I feel that it would not have been right for Germans to 
participate in this event. On this point, President Mitterrand 
and I have always been in total agreement. 
  [LIBERATION] Do you regret the fact that Chancellor Kohl 
could not attend? 
  [Mitterrand] Chancellor Kohl and I have never had a problem 
or misunderstanding on this issue. On 6 June, we will be 
commemorating an event, and history cannot be rewritten. 
Chancellor Kohl and I both considered that the anniversary of 
the Normandy landings was not the best occasion to celebrate and 
strengthen French-German friendship. 
  However, everyone in France knows that the defeat of Nazism 
enabled the building of a democratic Germany with which we have 
developed ties that are closer than with any other country. It 
is in this spirit that federal Germany will participate in the 
ceremonies of 8 May 1995. Before that date, we will soon have 
the opportunity to illustrate the exceptional relations that 
exist between our two countries when I visit Heidelberg on 8 
June, at the invitation of Chancellor Kohl, to attend the great 
French-German festival of youth. On 14 July [Bastille Day], as 
I requested, the European Defense Corps will parade along the 
Champs Elysees. 
  [LIBERATION] France and Germany have gone to war three times 
since the end of the 19th century. These tragedies are now a 
thing of the past. What assurances can you give your peoples to 
guarantee this can never occur again? 
  [Kohl] We Germans border on more European countries than 
anyone else. Therefore, our relentless pursuit of a policy for 
European unity is precisely a fundamental, if not the main, 
issue that shapes our future. 
  We cannot just take peace and freedom for granted. Each day 
we must take steps to ensure them. In my opinion, there can be 
no doubt that European unity is precisely the best insurance 
against an uprising of nationalism and chauvinism and against 
rivalry between powers, including here in the west of Europe. 
The success of our plans for the European Union [EU] is finally 
a question of war and peace for the 21st century. 
  [Mitterrand] There is no "fully comprehensive" insurance 
policy. First and foremost, everything is a question of will: 
the will of the political leaders and the will of the people. 
However, it is clear, more so today than yesterday, that 
European construction is the best possible guarantee against a 
return to this type of confrontation. That is why everyone who, 
here or there, through nationalism, nervousness, or selfishness 
argues in favor of inward-looking policies, is being very 
shortsighted and most unwise. There has never been strength or 
peace through disunion. 
  [LIBERATION] The Normandy landings took place 50 years ago. 
How much longer should we continue to commemorate the rifts in 
our shared history? Can these references to the past really 
serve to consolidate our relations? 
  [Kohl] I fully understand that the Allies want to 
commemorate 
these events that were of great significance for the whole of 
Europe and to remember their dead. We Germans, too, must 
remember this era in our history so that we are sure to learn 
the right lessons. On 8 June, President Mitterrand and I will 
meet young people from France and Germany in Heidelberg and 
stress the joint commitment of our peoples in favor of Europe. 
Using an idea of the historian Joseph Rovan, we will invite the 
youth of France and Germany to present their shared vision of 
Europe in the 21st century. I believe it is important to take 
their suggestions and proposals into account in our future work 
on continued European integration, especially when the Germans 
and French preside the EU. We must ensure that youth plays an 
active role in our discussions when we are talking about 
European construction, since it is precisely their future of 
peace and freedom that is at stake. 
  [Mitterrand] The history of two great nations, when they are 
neighbors, has rarely been a never-ending romance. There are 
good memories and bad memories and it would be rather simplistic 
to forget the bad things and remember only the good times. The 
waters of history run deep and voluntary amnesia, whether by 
peoples or individuals, is never a good solution. On the 
contrary, it is the accepted past that can feed the political 
will I spoke of before. We can only see an apparent paradox in 
the fact that the most spectacular coming together, which lies 
at the heart of European construction, has been that of France 
and Germany, the two countries that have fought the most over 
the last century. Here, as elsewhere, time has done its work 
and the time will come when we will no longer feel the need to 
commemorate events, even ones so memorable. 
  [LIBERATION] On 6 June 1944 we saw the large-scale 
commitment 
of the United States in the war against Nazism. This marked the 
start of a military presence in Europe, and especially in 
Germany, which continues to this day. What military role should 
the Americans play in Europe now? 
  [Kohl] The alliance with the democracies of North America 
and 
the presence of the Americans in Europe remains, and will remain 
in the future, for us Europeans, the most obvious expression of 
shared transatlantic values and an irreplaceable basis for 
keeping Europe on a stable footing of peace and security. On 
this point, I welcome the fact that President Clinton has 
renewed his commitment to keep 100,000 American military 
personnel stationed in Europe. With the EU, an effective 
alliance is an essential precondition to bring the new 
democracies of Central and Eastern Europe closer to the 
organizations of the West and to ensure general and lasting 
peace for the whole of Europe. 
  [Mitterrand] The vigor of the alliance with the United 
States 
and its European partners remains an essential part of our 
security, and the United States' military commitment in Europe 
is the very expression of the transatlantic link. This is why 
during the debates that have been held over the years on the 
development of NATO, I have always advocated that nothing be 
done that could divert the Atlantic Alliance from its basic 
mission, namely guaranteeing the security of its members. 
  Of course, this must not discourage Europeans from jointly 
building up a European defense system. It seems to me that we 
have made progress in this area. The creation of the Eurocorps 
is a significant step forward in this respect. The desire to 
develop the role of the Western European Union (WEU) is also a 
move in the same direction. At the last Atlantic Alliance 
summit in January I felt that our American and Canadian friends 
realized that, far from weakening the Alliance, this desire of 
the Europeans to assume their responsibilities in the areas of 
security and defense was, on the contrary, the best guarantee 
they could have of counting on genuinely determined allies in 
the long term, as set out in the preamble to the North Atlantic 
Treaty, "to safeguard the freedom of their peoples, their common 
heritage, and their civilization." 
  [LIBERATION] Under joint impetus from you both, France and 
Germany decided to create a European Army Corps. In your 
opinion, will the Eurocorps be the embryo of a European army? 
  [Kohl] With the creation of the European Corps, President 
Mitterrand and I intended -- as we have since the beginning -- 
to place close French-German cooperation in a Europe 
perspective. Since then, Belgium has responded positively to our 
invitation, which was sent to the member states of the WEU, to 
participate in the European Corps. Negotiations for Spain's 
entry are under way. Consequently, the European Corps, which 
should be fully established by 1995, is already a successful 
model for a European military structure, thanks to which both 
the European pillar of the Alliance and the WEU will be 
strengthened. It could therefore serve as an example for other 
large European units in a EU that is in the process of becoming 
integrated. I am especially pleased with President Mitterrand's 
gesture. He invited German, French, and Belgian soldiers from 
the Eurocorps to march in Paris during the traditional parade on 
14 July to mark the Bastille day celebrations. 
  [Mitterrand] My answer is obviously "yes." Will the embryo 
keep developing until it leads to the birth of a European army? 
That remains to be seen. However, I feel that there is no 
doubt at all about the fact that the gradual emergence of a 
genuine European defense identity, having the required resources 
and placed at the service of a joint policy, will be the 
touchstone of EU success in the long term. 
  [LIBERATION] On 7 May, you suggested that the aircraft 
carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a future 
European Navy." Are you suggesting the birth of an integrated 
European squadron based on the Eurocorps model? 
  [Mitterrand] Indeed, it seems to me that the issue will 
arise. In fact it has already started coming up with the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. On this occasion, it 
appeared to the Europeans that it was more simple and effective 
to coordinate, within the framework of the WEU, their 
participation in the naval embargo control operations. This is 
a first step. There will be others and I am very much in favor 
of them. What I told you about the European defense identity 
also holds true for the navy. Just like we put together the 
European Corps with elements from several countries' armies, we 
can undoubtedly envision the creation of standing multinational 
naval units which will also be the embryo of a future European 
navy. 
  [LIBERATION] President Mitterrand has just suggested that 
the 
aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle "ensures France's place in a 
future European Navy." Would you be prepared to have this ship 
participate in an integrated European squadron set up along the 
lines of the Eurocorps? 
  [Kohl] For the naval forces, the multinational aspect and 
commitment within an international framework are part of a tried 
and tested tradition. For many years now, we have been 
maintaining close cooperation in this area with France and with 
our partners in the Alliance. In this context I would simply 
reiterate that NATO's standing naval intervention units and the 
naval forces set up on an ad hoc basis within the WEU have, over 
the last few years, contributed primarily toward overcoming 
various crises. 
  We have therefore agreed to develop procedures to be able to 
establish a French-German naval unit at any time for joint 
missions. Outside the bilateral framework proper, this kind of 
temporarily established unit could be placed at the disposal of 
NATO or the WEU. This kind of availability on both sides would 
correspond to the model supplied by the European Corps and would 
be a fresh contribution toward reinforcing the WEU's operational 
capability and European commitments within NATO. In this 
respect, I understand President Mitterrand's statements as a 
sign to legally accentuate Europe's efforts in naval matters. 
  [LIBERATION] Today's ceremonies have reminded us that the 
United States of America plays a crucial role in Europe 
politically, economically, culturally, and socially. What is 
your assessment of this in the light of this event? Is it 
symbolic of current relations between America and Europe? 
  [Kohl] In the past, during the time of the East-West 
conflict, the transatlantic link binding us firmly to the United 
States of America and Canada was primarily geared toward matters 
of security policy. Today, we are duty-bound to broaden this 
link to take in other sectors and, in particular, to intensify 
cooperation in the areas of the economy, culture, and science. 
It is also important to reinforce exchanges of young people, 
thus consolidating ties of friendship between young people on 
both sides of the Atlantic. 
  [Mitterrand] The United States of America occupies an 
important place in Europe at all levels. This is the result of 
that country's qualities, its dynamism, and its creativity, but 
also its economic and financial power, the size of its domestic 
market, and the size of its businesses. It is here that we are 
faced with stiff competition which is highlighted by the effect 
of our own divisions. This is true despite the fact that here in 
Europe we have a considerable potential for creativity, whether 
in technology, science, culture, the arts, etc. I see in this 
yet another reason to work toward reinforcing the EU further. 
The dialogue between the United States and Europe will only be 
richer and more fruitful for it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister and </F>
chairman of the Free Democratic Party of Germany, FDP, by 
unidentified DER STANDARD correspondent; place and date not 
given: "Kinkel -- Uncomfortable With Haider's Appearances"] 
  [Text] [DER STANDARD] In your speech at the [FDP] party 
conference you mentioned the policies of Manfred Brunner, a 
former FDP member and now chairman of the Alliance of Free 
Citizens, and Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of 
Austria. You criticized them both and said they represent "a 
different policy." Yet, only a short while ago, Haider was a 
guest of honor at FDP events. 
  [Kinkel] Haider was indeed invited to several events by 
subdivisions of the FDP. I did not feel comfortable with that, 
but we are a liberal, tolerant party. Mr. Haider supports 
policies that are incompatible with our ideas of liberalism. 
  [DER STANDARD] Does this mean that Haider will not be 
invited 
to any FDP events in the future? 
  [Kinkel] I think it would be very unwise for FDP 
subdivisions 
to invite Haider, who is actively campaigning for the 
anti-Europe Brunner. But there is no imperative mandate in our 
party. 
  [DER STANDARD] Mr. Kinkel, why did you, in your capacity as 
foreign minister, support Austria so strongly during the 
European Union [EU] membership negotiations? 
  [Kinkel] Because I am convinced that Austria and the other 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries need to be in 
the EU. They will be an asset in economic, political, and 
cultural terms. This goes especially for Austria. It would be 
rather strange, if the German Foreign Minister did not speak up 
for Austria in particular. 
  [DER STANDARD] The referendum on EU membership is pratically 
upon us. Do you expect a positive outcome? 
  [Kinkel] I do not want to interfere in Austria's internal 
affairs. But I cannot imagine the Austrians taking a negative 
decision in the referendum.

  [Text] Mainz (DDP/ADN) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin is presently on a private visit to Mainz to have a 
kidney stone complaint examined. His Moscow doctors advised him 
to obtain a second opinion in Germany, Chernomyrdin told a news 
conference in Mainz today. Treatment for the illness, from 
which he has suffered for several years, could not be put off 
any longer. Chernomyrdin said the kidney complaint "bothers" 
him, but it does not impair his work in any way. The prime 
minister announced that the treatment will presumably begin in 
Mainz and be continued in Moscow. A long stay in Germany is not 
planned: "I may fly back before Friday [10 June]," Chernomyrdin 
said. 
  Rudolf Hohenfellner, the doctor treating Chernomyrdin at the 
Johannes Gutenberg University Clinic in Mainz, confirmed that 
Chernomyrdin is not suffering from any other illnesses. "His 
state of health is actually excellent," Hohenfellner said. A 
decision on treatment will not be made until the final diagnosis 
has been obtained this afternoon, the doctor said.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "Peace Negotiations Like Those </F>
in Geneva--Lafontaine, Dressler, Scharping, and the 
Sociopolitical Debate in the SPD"] 
  [Text] Bonn, May--Rudolf Dressler's criticism of 
sociopolitical statements by Oskar Lafontaine is seen by veteran 
Social Democrats as representing the future battle line within 
the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. "Anyone who wants 
to use the reduction of social services as a means for 
conducting Social Democratic politics will have the opportunity 
to present this for consideration at the forthcoming SPD party 
congress in Halle"--thus the response by deputy parliamentary 
caucus chairman and sociopolitician Dressler to the 
minister-president of the Saarland, who, more in passing than 
anything else, had stated that, in a consolidation of the budget 
under an SPD government, social services could also be 
considered for cuts. Not the traditional right-left debates over 
foreign policy or the relationship with the Greens would 
characterize the various wings of the party, say Social 
Democrats from the tradition-bound SPD from the Ruhr District. 
The position taken relative to social policies and to cutbacks 
in funding for social services will become the distinguishing 
feature. Only people with their own swimming pool could do 
without the public pool, the debate escalates. 
  The triviality of the cause and the efforts being made to 
clear the matter up indicate that Rudolf Scharping has only 
succeeded in settling the dispute for the time being, but not in 
eliminating the more deep-seated differences of opinion. 
Following a conversation with SPD finance ministers of the 
laender, Lafontaine had explained the familiar finance policy 
details of the campaign platform: No increase in the tax rate, 
budgetary austerity. As long as an economic recovery had not 
gotten off the ground, there could be no cuts in the federal 
budget, since jobs would be threatened otherwise. But if there 
is an upward trend in the economy, one sustained not only by the 
demand for exports but also by demand at home, "social services" 
would also be put on the "test stand." There would be "a wailing 
and a chattering of teeth" if that happened, he indicated. 
Dressler felt compelled by reactions from within the party and 
probably also from shop stewards close to the SPD to come up 
with a clear reply. "The assertion that an SPD-led Federal 
Government would also resort to a curtailment of social services 
as a means for consolidating the public finances is not 
justified by anything." Within the Bundestag caucus, critical 
questions along this same line were asked. "The consolidation of 
public finances cannot be achieved through a cut in social 
services," deputy party chairman Thierse was quoted as saying. 
Scharping was called upon to mediate. Before making public 
criticisms, those involved should make use of the telephone, he 
said. His admonitions were viewed as "elegant" because he had 
named no names and had thus "damaged" no one. A telephonic 
conference circuit among Scharping, Dressler, and Lafontaine was 
intended to settle the dispute. 
  Many are comparing Scharping's efforts with "Geneva" peace 
negotiations, at the conclusion of which the chairman announced 
the formula for settlement. The federal deficit threatens to 
strangulate the state budgets; the share borne by the state 
cannot be increased. The SPD will keep the increase in Federal 
spending "below the increase in the GNP." Scharping is trying to 
do justice to both sides. With respect to Lafontaine, 
Scharping's text contains the following: "The consequence is 
obvious: In the course of putting the federal finances back on 
an even keel, and on the basis of an environmentally compatible 
growth, the SPD will subject all federal services--including 
taxation and social--to continuing scrutiny." Meant for Dressler 
was the assurance that the essential thing now was to establish 
the "aiming accuracy" of federal services and to avoid 
"weakening effects." "That is not social dismantlement, but, on 
the contrary, a component of the urgently needed modernization 
of activities by the state." Recommendations taken from the 
SPD's governing program on child allowances and on "doing away 
with unjust tax exemptions" were appended. All sides were able 
to affirm afterwards that the dispute was now "settled." 
Conjectures to the contrary have remained. 
  Dressler's intention had been to counter false signals which 
might have weakened the will of the party to conduct an active 
electoral campaign. He may have recalled earlier statements made 
by Lafontaine. "The second is--that too must be said here--that 
only massive intervention in consumer spending--I repeat: 
massive intervention in consumer spending--will be able to slow 
down the continued dramatic rise in the Federal deficit once the 
economy has begun to recover again." The applause of the party 
congress for these clear words by Lafontaine was not effusive at 
this point of his speech. His election as one of Rudolf 
Scharping's deputies nevertheless turned into a vote of 
confidence. He received 381 votes last November in Wiesbaden, 20 
more than Scharping received in his election as party chairman, 
and almost 60 more than Rudolf Dressler got in the election to 
the party executive. The voters must be told the truth, 
Lafontaine had called out, as if to affirm anew his campaign of 
1990. 
  Despite his success at the party congress, Lafontaine has 
long been viewed by tradition-bound Social Democrats as 
representing an individualistic political approach, one which 
underestimates the importance of societal "solidarity." 
Representatives of the labor unions and also the socialist left 
wing of the party join forces here. The fiscal policy of 
Lafontaine and of deputy parliamentary caucus chairwoman Ingrid 
Matthaeus-Maier are destroying the foundations of the SPD, 
critics note--softly, for the time being, so as not to disrupt 
the campaign. And many are also looking at Scharping, who had 
made Lafontaine the deputy chairman of the election platform 
committee, as well as the fiscal and economic policy spokesman 
of the party leadership. The two of them, they are wont to say, 
want to form a "strong axis." The turmoil surrounding 
Lafontaine's statements, which contentwise are nothing but a 
watered-down version of his announcements of last November, 
shows how thin the ice that sustains them is in the event of a 
conflict.

<F P=106> [Article by Phillip Johnston: "Major Reaffirms Hostility to </F>
Single Currency"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister continued to push a sceptical 
line on Europe yesterday as campaigning for Thursday's elections 
entered the final few days with the Tories facing heavy losses. 
  Mr. John Major made clear that he was instinctively opposed 
to a single currency for Europe, although the Government's 
official policy is that a decision should be made by a future 
parliament. 
  Last month, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he believed the 
Maastricht timetable for a move to a single currency by l999 was 
both achievable and desirable. But Mr. Major, interviewed on 
BBC television's Breakfast with Frost, said hostility to the 
idea was growing in Britain and across Europe. 
  "My instincts are not in favour of it," he said. "I can 
conceive circumstances a long time in the distance where it may 
conceivably be in our economic interests. 
  "I do not believe these circumstances will apply for a very 
long time, certainly not this side of the turn of the century or 
probably a long time after that. " 
  Mr. Major said he would "never say never" to the possibility 
of Britain eventually entering a currency union and while he saw 
some merits for the principle of the argument his objections 
were practical. He did not believe the economic circumstances 
of Europe would "converge" sufficiently to allow monetary union 
to happen. 
  Mr. Major's noticeably more ambivalent line towards European 
integration -- evinced by his call last week for a "multispeed", 
flexible community -- has dismayed some of his party's 
Euro-enthusiasts. It was pointed out yesterday that Mr. Michael 
Portillo, the Treasury chief secretary, was taken to task last 
month for voicing his own scepticism about a single currency, 
something the Prime Minister is now content to do himself. 
  But the bulk of Tory MPs appears happier with the line on 
Europe and believes the party now striking the right balance, 
putting clear water between them and their opponents. 
  Euro-sceptics are also anxious to exploit the change in tone 
to press Mr. Major to veto any attempt to appoint Belgium's 
federalist prime minister, M Jean Luc Dehaene, as the next 
Commission president in succession to M Jacques Delors. 
  Conservatives hope the distinctive policy the Government is 
trying to promote on Europe will encourage supporters to come 
out and vote on Thursday to forestall an anticipated debacle 
with the loss of at least a dozen seats. 
  Last week's Gallup poll for THE DAILY TELEGRAPH -- placing 
the Conservatives on 21 per cent, their poorest rating since 
1945 -- has encouraged the view that the Tories are facing 
humiliation. Significant losses, reducing the Conservatives to 
fewer than l0 of the country's 84 seats, would inevitably renew 
pressure on Mr. Major's leadership. 
  Mr. Major dismissed as "scare politics" yesterday Opposition 
claims that the Government was considering a further extension 
in the scope of VAT [Value Added Tax] in this year's Budget. 
Labour has elevated VAT to the forefront of its campaigning in 
the final few days of the European elections in the hope of 
exploiting voter anger at the taxing of domestic fuel and power 
at eight per cent in April. 
  The issue lost the Conservatives substantial support in 
by-elections last year and the latest controversy -- fuelled by 
the refusal of Mr. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, to rule out 
future increases -- is seen by the Opposition as a timely 
reminder of the Government's "broken promises". 
  Mr. Major yesterday reaffirmed that the Government had "no 
plans, no intentions and no likelihood" of extending VAT to 
areas that remain zero-rated.

  [Excerpts] There has been further criticism from abroad 
concerning the presence of ministers from the National Alliance 
in the Italian Government. Yesterday we had the bitter 
criticism by European Commission President Jacques Delors and 
the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, who both 
accused Chamber of Deputies Speaker Irene Pivetti of having an 
anti-Semitic background. [passage omitted] Let's turn to the 
reactions in Italy. Stefano Bellini reports: 
  [Bellini] Following the concerns expressed by Francois 
Mitterrand and Andreas Papandreou, another high profile figure 
-- Jacques Delors -- has also expressed concern. With anger in 
my heart -- these were his words -- I read the interview given 
by Gianfranco Fini on the positive aspects of fascism until 1938 
and on the loss of European cultural identity as it was being 
freed from Nazi fascism. 
  These opinions have brought a wave of criticism. The widow 
of Giorgio Almirante said Delors's views were a disgusting 
attack. Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center 
thundered that Italy is a serious country which merits respect. 
The Italian Foreign Ministry said that the president of the 
European Commission's views were personal and did not involve 
any government. 
  Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio defended Irene Pivetti and 
rejected the accusations of anti-Semitism made against her. 
  Rosa Russo Jervolino is of a completely different opinion 
and 
she has rejected the offer made by the leader of the National 
Alliance to join the ruling coalition. Achille Occhetto said 
Delors's remarks were not meddling and that the European 
right-wing parties could draw comfort from the success of the 
Italian Right. 
  This is what Gianfranco Fini told Luce Tommasi: 
  [Begin recording] [Tommasi] Fini, what do you say to Jacques 
Delors and to Israel, following the reassuring comments made by 
Peres? 
  [Fini] I don't think that I have to give any reply. I am 
happy that Shim'on Peres has stressed that there is no hostility 
on the part of the Israeli Government toward the Italian 
Government. More than ever I am convinced that the concerns of 
Jacques Delors will diminish shortly when everyone has 
understood what the guiding values of both the government and 
the National Alliance are. [end recording] 
  [Bellini] Furthermore, Fini has given assurances that the 
National Alliance will not join the same grouping as Jean-Marie 
Le Pen's extremists in the European Parliament.

  [Text] Cyprus has great expectations of Russia for efforts 
to promote the next step of the Cyprus issue following the 
failure of the talks on the confidence-building measures. 
Within this framework, and with Russia's active support, the 
Cyprus Government will work toward holding an international 
conference. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis 
went to Moscow at the invitation of his Russian counterpart, 
Andrey Kozyrev, to discuss the issue of an international 
conference. In a statement about the prospects of such a 
conference, Mikhailidhis said it is a serious proposal 
considering that the initiatives so far have failed. 
  In a statement to reporters at Larnaca Airport, Mikhailidhis 
said his talks in Moscow will focus on the Cyprus issue, the UN 
secretary general's latest report, and the fact that the report 
includes some specific Russian proposals on the future course 
and developments following the failure of the 
confidence-building measures initiative. 
  The foreign minister mentioned that apart from the Cyprus 
issue, he will also discuss a series of bilateral issues and 
expects to sign interstate agreements on various issues that are 
already being studied and that will be finalized and signed 
during the visit. 
  The minister said our side considers the talks in Moscow as 
very significant for two main reasons: There is serious and 
worthwhile Russian activity in the international political scene 
and a strong Russian interest in Cyprus. Mikhailidhis stressed 
that these facts are very significant at a time when the 
Security Council, particularly the permanent members, will deal 
with the next step after the deadlock of the confidence-building 
measures and will evaluate the various options. He said: We 
believe that Russia can play an important role since Cyprus has 
maintained friendship and cooperative relations with Russia for 
many years. 
  Mikhailidhis then responded to questions from journalists: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Apart from the international 
conference, Russia also proposed visits by the representatives 
of the five UN Security Council permanent members to the 
Nicosia-Athens-Ankara triangle. Do you believe that this idea 
can gain ground today? 
  [Mikhailidhis] I believe the idea of negotiations between 
the 
UN Security Council permanent members and the sides that are 
involved in the Cyprus issue is a very serious proposal that has 
prospects. In any case it is a beginning toward the final goal, 
which must be the international conference. Our position was 
made clear through statements and meetings I had with the 
ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members. 
We believe that the UN secretary general's report has a very 
significant conclusion: That the Turkish side has no political 
will to resolve the Cyprus issue or to reach an agreement on any 
initiative. Therefore, the next step must be decided through 
negotiations. We see these negotiations happening through the 
permanent members, which is the proposal that you have mentioned. 
  [Correspondent] The U.S. and British proposals are obviously 
in favor of continuing the confidence-building measures 
procedure, and the Russian interest is a counterproposal to this 
effort. Do you believe things will finally move toward an 
international conference? Is this possible? 
  [Mikhailidhis] Maybe it is natural for countries that have 
invested many efforts on promoting the confidence-building 
measures initiative to feel that they must exhaust all efforts, 
but our side has made its position crystal clear: We believe 
the issue ended with the submission of the final 21 March UN 
document. It was later seen that our position was correct. 
Further discussions aiming to clarify or explain points or any 
other procedure that took place since then has been fruitless. 
They were delayed by the submission of the report, and gave 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas the opportunity to further 
delay the procedure and the UN secretary general's initiative. 
In his report, the UN secretary general himself says there is 
no prospect for the confidence-building measures. So, we 
believe it is useless and damaging to continue with meetings or 
discussions on the confidence-building measures. 
  Currently, we must deal with only one issue: the lack of 
political will by the Turkish side. We must also answer these 
questions: How will the Turkish side's negative stance change, 
how will the lack of political will change? We must not take 
any steps before clarifying these issues because it could be a 
step that would complicate the problem and reduce the 
persuasiveness of the procedure itself. 
  [Correspondent] Can you comment on Denktas' latest 
provocative statements about "disarmament" and a "Nonaggression 
Pact" between the Republic of Cyprus and the pseudostate? 
  [Mikhailidhis] Denktas said something that he has repeated 
many times. He has only one goal: The recognition of separate 
sovereign rights for both communities, which is an indirect but 
clear recognition of the pseudostate. He also made similar 
efforts during the talks on the confidence-building measures. He 
believed the two communities should finally agree on the 
measures based on their sovereign rights. We find this 
unacceptable. Separate sovereign rights do not exist for us. 
We believe in what the UN resolutions say: a single sovereignty. 
  Therefore, his reference to the disarmament issue once again 
stems from his position of recognition for the pseudostate and 
two states that will search for some form of a pact either of 
cooperation or nonaggression. Our side will not discuss issues 
of separate sovereignty. There is only one sovereignty. Now, 
on the safety issue. If the Turkish Cypriot leadership feels 
there is a safety issue then there is certainly a safety issue 
for our side--the presence of the 35,000 Turkish troops. Let us 
discuss the safety issue but not the separate sovereignty issue. 
  [Correspondent] We also heard the option of an appeal to the 
UN General Assembly. How do you handle this? 
  [Mikhailidhis] The National Council studied the options 
listed in the UN secretary general's report and made various 
suggestions. The Council will continue and conclude its meeting 
on Wednesday. I do not want to comment on any option before the 
National Council concludes its meeting. All options are open to 
evaluation. 
  [Correspondent] Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
visited Moscow and you recently met with him. Has an 
international conference on Cyprus been prepared in any way and 
what do you believe are the chances for such a conference? 
  [Mikhailidhis] Naturally, the Greek foreign minister and I 
exchanged views on Russia's role in this stage and on issues 
related to the Cyprus problem that would be raised during 
Papoulias' visit in Moscow. It was very important that 
Papoulias' visit preceded mine and I believe that now we will be 
able to have a complete picture on Russia's intentions and 
interest as well as its evaluations. 
  About the prospect of an international conference, I believe 
it is a serious proposal considering that the initiatives so far 
have failed. Currently, there is no prospect for new 
initiatives, new texts, or new documents. We have tried all of 
these over the past 20 years. Now we must approach the 
substance of the matter, the presence of occupation troops, the 
presence of settlers to Cyprus. That is, we must deal with 
those facts that support the lack of political will by the 
Turkish side. In time, we will find out if some countries agree 
or disagree, but we will work in this direction. 
  Answering a question on the latest resolution of the 
Nonaligned Movement [NAM], Mikhailidhis described it as a 
tremendous step forward because it includes all the elements 
that we wanted to include. It refers to President Glavkos 
Kliridhis' demilitarization proposal, the issue of an 
international conference, and the withdrawal of Turkish troops 
and settlers. The NAM gave a strong message at a critical time 
when we needed it.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Security Council </F>
Secretariat General on 6 June] 
  [Text] The National Security Council [NSC] held an 
extraordinary session at the Cankaya Presidential Mansion on 6 
June under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel, with 
the participation of the prime minister, the chief of the 
General Staff, NSC member ministers, the force commanders, the 
general commander of the Gendarmerie, and the secretary general 
of the NSC. The state minister and deputy prime minister also 
attended the meeting. 
  The developments in northern Iraq within the context of 
Operation Provide Comfort were discussed during the meeting. 
The NSC determined that the conditions in the region have not 
reached the point that call for the termination of the said 
operation. In view of this situation and in light of the 
importance of protecting Iraq's territorial integrity, the NSC 
decided to recommend to the government to extend the mandate of 
the multinational force as of 30 June for a period to be deemed 
appropriate.

  [Text] Ankara, June 6 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Monday [6 June] said that a final solution in Cyprus can only be 
reached with the free will of the Turkish Cypriot community. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement said that some declarations 
claimed to have been made by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin are 
untrue. 
  The press on Monday had said that President Rauf Denktas of 
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] said "if southern 
Cyprus joins European Union [EU], we will join Turkey" and that 
Cetin answered by saying "let's see if the TRNC people will then 
support Denktas." 
  The statement said these allegations were untrue. 
  "Turkey believes that any decision on the membership of the 
Greek Cypriot to the EU without the knowledge or agreement of 
the Turkish Cypriots will hurt the talks process to solve the 
issue," the statement also added.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/481: "Humanitarian Aid for the </F>
Population of Yemen"] 
  [Text] The European Commission has decided to grant 
emergency humanitarian aid totalling ECU200,000 to the victims 
of the civil war in Yemen. 
  The aid, which will be delivered by Medecins sans 
Frontieres-France [Doctors Without Borders], will 
include: 

  -  Caring for the wounded on both sides; 
  -  Providing 
essential care to displaced persons from the south who have 
grouped together in Aden and Lahej (a town 40 km north of Aden). 
They are living in schools and other public buildings under 
extremely precarious conditions; 
  -  Assistance to the 7,000 Somali 
refugees in the Al Kawd camp in the territory of Abyan, located 
to the east of Aden and support to move them away from the front 
lines as soon as possible. 

  The aid is being organized out of two centers. The Aden team 
will provide first aid material to the civilian hospitals and 
will monitor the hygiene conditions of displaced persons. The 
Sana'a team will supply the hospitals in Sana'a and the 
territories of Ibb and Taez. It will also be responsible for 
moving the refugee camp. 
  The aid from ECHO, the humanitarian office of the European 
Community, will be used to buy, transport, and distribute 
medical kits and pharmaceuticals, to buy materials on site for 
displaced persons and refugees, and to help defray the cost of 
sending expatriate staff there for one month. 
  Since the beginning of the confrontations between the forces 
of the north and south on 5 May, the Commission has granted 
ECU500,000 in emergency aid.

<F P=106> [Interview with EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert </F>
by Hugo Camps; place and date not given: "`Maastricht Was a 
Failure"] 
  [Excerpt] According to Karel van Miert, as time goes by 
Europe is behaving more and more like an out of control 
projectile. The aimlessness of the European Union (EU) strikes 
the citizen in the face like a tasteless striptease. 
  [Van Miert] Here are two examples. In Germany and elsewhere, 
there are those who fervently advocate the rapid integration of 
a number of central European countries, i.e., enlargement as the 
certificate of good European behavior. Nobody is warning about 
the dramatic consequences this will have for the countries 
joining. We have obviously not learned from the unexpected 
integration of East Germany. Enlargement means that the new 
member states will be entitled to get money from the EU budgets. 
The amount of the regional and structural funds must be 
increased immediately. That presupposes doubling the European 
budget. Germany set the ball rolling for a rapid accession of 
the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia. Yet it is aiming 
to slim down its own contribution. So we are faced with a 
flagrant contradiction which creates a tremendous amount of 
conflict. 
  [Camps] Europe is threatening to sink beneath its own 
foundations. 
  [Van Miert] The EU institutional organization can clearly 
digest the enlargement from 12 to 16 member states. With the 
accession of a number of central European countries, however, 
the administrative apparatus is backed into a tight corner. And 
that is not all. The Greeks, British, and Spaniards are now 
calling for Malta and Cyprus to join the EU. In short, a total 
imbroglio is right outside our door with an escalation of the 
conflicts between large and small states plus the prestige envy 
between small countries and ministates. Will anyone ever agree 
that Malta should speak for the entire EU as Luxembourg can 
today? With this harebrained accession policy we are heading 
straight for the abyss. Some people can see this, but hesitate 
to warn others about it. Others secretly reckon that Europe will 
go to its institutional chaos." 
  What most grieves the European commissioner is the fact that 
the original motivation for European unification has been 
abandoned. Somberly, he said: "A Community that goes further 
than an interstate cooperation is needed now more than ever. We 
once again find ourselves in a political context which at that 
time was so crucial for the EU creation: Europe as an answer to 
the spiral of border conflicts. Those who thought that the 
passion for territory had subsided now have one less illusion 
because of the tragedy in Yugoslavia. Within the Union too, the 
yearning for border corrections is rife. The new majority in 
Italy has already let it be known publicly that it wants to 
review its border with Yugoslavia. Istria could be the 
beginning of a nightmare. In Germany, too, the border issue is 
a sensitive point. The EU is a child of the Cold War. Now that 
the Cold War is over, some people have growing desire to modify 
the former borders. It surprises me that a European offensive 
has not yet gotten under way to counteract this perverse 
mentality." 
  Karel Van Miert does not want to be called a prophet of 
doom. 
However: "For the first time in postwar history, there is the 
danger that we will all wake up in the old Europe of the 
1930's." The only antidote he sees to the irreversible process 
of unravelling and dilution is the faster implementation of 
political and monetary union, even in a Europe moving at 
different speeds. "If monetary union is not implemented within 
five years, then it could be too late. I am afraid that by then 
we would have definitely missed our chance." 
  [Camps] So the Maastricht Treaty has been outstripped. 
  [Van Miert] Maastricht was a failure. We did not feel the 
historical momentum of the time. Kohl himself said that Europe 
had to be institutionally reinforced in view of German 
unification. The signal was not picked up in Maastricht. For 
me it has been an enormous disappointment. Instead of quickly 
elaborating a monetary union and a defense community, Maastricht 
awakened the illusion that a common foreign policy had been set 
aside for Europe. That is like putting the cart before the 
horse. Foreign policy must grow out of a common monetary and 
defense policy. Not the other way around. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Alan Pike: "Poverty of Vision"] </F>
  [Text] "Social policy is the Achilles heel of Europe," Mr 
Raphael Chanterie, a Belgian member of the European Parliament 
told a conference on the subject last week. 
  His audience of government officials, academics and industry 
representatives murmured assent, but could have spent hours 
disagreeing with each other over what the statement meant. It 
might have been possible to thrash out an agreed definition of 
"Achilles heel"; "social policy" would have presented greater 
difficulties. 
  Their confusion is partly understandable. European Union 
[EU] social policy has traditionally been dominated by 
employment-related issues. Alongside these, however, a clutch 
of policies concerned with the poor -- or, in the EU's preferred 
term, the "socially excluded" -- has grown in significance. 
Anti-poverty organisations are increasingly looking to Europe 
for initiatives to attack deprivation. But they fear that EU 
involvement in this area of social policy is about to collapse. 
  Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU social affairs commissioner, is 
currently sifting through hundreds of responses to a green paper 
on options for the future of social policy, before presenting 
final proposals to the Commission in a white paper next month. 
The green paper sounded powerful warnings about the dangers of 
excluding large sections of Europe's population from a 
reasonable share of wealth and opportunities. Violence, drug 
abuse, racism, political extremism and social unrest were, it 
said, all likely to result. 
  Mr Flynn made it clear last week, however, that against a 
background of high unemployment, job creation would "dominate 
the whole agenda" arising from his white paper. He emphasised 
his opposition to the emergence of a "dual society" of 
advantaged and disadvantaged in Europe, but argued the best way 
of supporting the most needy groups was through measures to 
attack long-term unemployment. 
  With the number of the EU's poor variously estimated at 
between 50 million and 70 million, antipoverty organisations 
regard the idea of relying on labour market policies alone to 
tackle "social exclusion" as wishful thinking. The green paper 
itself concedes that a return to full employment is "unlikely in 
the foreseeable future" without significant policy changes. 
Europe created 9 million jobs between 1985 and 1991 but 
unemployment fell by only 3 million. 
  The European Antipoverty Network, which represents voluntary 
organisations in the 12 member states, wants the introduction of 
rules requiring poverty and its social consequences to be taken 
into account in all EU policies, in the way that environmental 
factors are considered. But campaigners' fears that their 
efforts will fall on deaf ears have been compounded by signs 
that the financial help the EU gives to the poor may be under 
threat. 
  Although relief of poverty is a responsibility of individual 
states, the EU supports experimental projects aimed at changing 
the lives of the poor. Poverty 3, its current five-year 
programme, ends this month, and last year Mr Jacques Delors, 
Commission president, expressed hopes that it would be followed 
by a more ambitious Poverty 4 with its budget doubled to ECUllO 
million (85m pounds). 
  But Germany, in what started as a dispute between the 
Federal 
Government and laender over responsibility for running 
antipoverty programmes, has blocked the introduction of the 
initiative. Behind the dispute are wider reservations, shared 
by some UK and Dutch ministers, about the appropriateness of EU 
involvement in this area of social policy. 
  Mr Delors is believed to have tried to rescue Poverty 4 in 
talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl -- without success. Unless 
there is an unexpected breakthrough at a meeting of social 
affairs ministers on June 22, there is little chance of the 
programme being launched during the six-month German EU 
presidency, which begins next month. With the specialist teams 
that worked on Poverty 3 already breaking up because of the 
uncertainty, this could mark the end of the programme. The 
resistance to Poverty 4 is also giving rise to doubts about the 
future of other EU social initiatives such as its work with the 
elderly. 
  Most of Europe's poor would not immediately notice the loss 
of the programmes -- budgets have never been big enough to 
relieve much poverty. But Poverty 3 has helped fund schemes for 
former prisoners in Italy, itinerant families in Ireland, 
narcotics addicts in Greece single parents in Bristol. 
  A House of Lords sub-committee concluded last month that it 
had led to work which would not otherwise have been done, 
relieving poverty and starting to "rebuild the economic and 
social lives of some severely deprived communities." Although 
the invigoration of local economies was beyond the capacity of 
small projects, the committee said it was "impressed by the 
determination and ingenuity" shown by Poverty 3 initiatives in 
creating limited numbers of new jobs. 
  The local government centre at Warwick University, which has 
co-ordinated and monitored the UK projects included under the 
Poverty 3 umbrella, lists a series of small but significant 
practical achievements. They include a scheme to train black 
people for voluntary work in Bristol, development of a new 
childcare centre at Pilton, Edinburgh, and changes in Liverpool 
city council's policies to encourage the employment of local 
labour. 
  But supporters say the programme's most significant 
contribution has been its direct involvement of needy and 
deprived people in efforts to rebuild their communities. The 
encouragement and prestige of having the EU flag flying over 
little local initiatives in Scottish housing estates and 
Portuguese mountain villages has, they say, been worth as much 
as the money. 
  Mr Dennis Preston, who chairs the Brownlow Community Trust, 
says Poverty 3 has provided a local test bed for national urban 
aid policies. Warwick University researchers say it has enabled 
people to "participate in the process of change, rather than 
becoming resentful objects of it." 
  Europe's antipoverty groups fear that, if the EU abandons 
such initiatives, the dangers of that resentment being expressed 
in the dark forms described in its green paper will come at 
least a little closer.

<F P=106> [Report by Lionel Barber: "Brussels Recommends Trade </F>
Benefits Overhaul"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission yesterday 
recommended an overhaul of trade benefits for around 60 
developing countries, with new incentives for improving 
environmental and labour standards. 
  The guidelines are part of a review of the generalised 
system 
of preferences [GSP] which grants tariff advantages to 
developing countries to help them export to the EU [European 
Union] market. 
  The GSP review, which takes place every 10 years, is part of 
a wide-ranging Brussels effort to update trade policy toward the 
developing world. 
  The Commission is waiting to hear views from EU ministers 
and 
the European Parliament before it decides on how to apply the 
new GSP scheme to specific countries and sectors. But the broad 
outlines of reform are already clear ahead of the Commission's 
ambitious deadline of January 1 1995 for starting the new scheme. 
  First, the Commission wants to offer extra trade benefits to 
encourage countries to pursue sound environmental policies and 
follow international labour agreements on the lines of the ILO 
[International Labour Organisation] convention. Brussels 
officials argue that this amounts to "positive" discrimination 
which should not therefore arouse opposition from GATT. 
  Mr Pierre Defraigne, senior Commission official in charge of 
North-South relations, added that Brussels had deliberately 
underlined the link between social and environmental policies 
and trade. 
  Second, the new guidelines are supposed to be simpler to 
manage. Starting with GATT's Most Favoured Nation [MFN] status 
as a baseline, Brussels wants to offer new flexible rates which 
will decline progressively from 50 per cent, 75 per cent and 100 
per cent of MFN. 
  Third, the goal is to reduce the number of countries 
eligible 
for GSP, with "super-competitors" such as fast-growing East 
Asian economies dropping out of the running. The criteria for 
GSP eligibility will be per capital GDP and the proportion of 
manufacturing for exports which directly competes with European 
products in the EU market. 
  Fourth, the Commission wants to introduce a safeguard clause 
which will be "very close to the GATT safety clause," said Mr 
Defraigne. This would operate against as yet unidentified 
"sensitive" products.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT: </F>
"Biotechnology: Communication Outlines Two-Pronged Growth 
Programme"] 
  [Text] Environmentalists have reacted angrily to the 
preparation of the soon-to-be released European Commission 
Communication on the deregulation of biotechnology legislation. 
The Communication is to be presented by the Commission at the 
Heads of Government Summit in Corfu on 23, 24 June. It outlines 
what the Commission believes should be done "in order that the 
full potential of modern biotechnology for jobs, investment and 
growth can be realised." But environmental groups, such as 
Greenpeace International, are afraid the Communication might 
become part of EU policy before any proper examination of the 
risks of associated with the easing of controls over 
genetically-modified organisms (GMOs). 
  The Commission's White Paper of Growth, Competitiveness, and 
Employment pinpointed biotechnology as one of the fields 
offering the greatest potential for innovation and growth in the 
EU. To help the industry, the white paper concluded there 
should be a review of the EU's biotechnology regulatory 
framework. That review concluded that the risks involved in the 
use of GMOs when the EU's regulations were developed are 
"substantially less than were once foreseen." For example, the 
potential for horizontal gene transfer resulting in novel and 
harmful properties being acquired by micro-organisms has not 
been shown to present hazards to human heath and the 
environment. "There is growing confidence that the GMOs used in 
research and in industrial production can be more precisely 
categorised, so that they are unable to survive except in the 
special environment of the experiment or process in which they 
are used," the Communication says. It adds that bearing in mind 
its findings during the review, the Commission had developed a 
twin-track approach to the future development of the 
biotechnological regulatory framework, covering: 

  -  The 
exploitation of existing possibilities for revising 
measures/procedures/degree of oversight/requirements, through 
use of a "light" procedure of adaptation to technical progress 
(via the regulatory Committee procedure); and 
  -  The bringing 
forward of amendments to existing legislation in order to 
incorporate changes which cannot be achieved by technical 
adaptation while leaving the basic structure of the framework 
intact. 

  Put simply, the Commission wants to ease the current 
legislation. The particular Directives concerned are 90/219/EEC 
on the contained use of genetically-modified organisms and 
90/220/EEC on the deliberate release of GMOs to the environment. 
For Directive N 90/220 the Communication outlines the following 
objectives for further action: 
  i) streamlining and easing of the 
administrative/notification/consent requirements where this does 
not compromise safety; 
  ii) ensuring that the classification of the 
genetically-modified micro-organisms and of the activities in 
which they are used are appropriate to the risks involved; 
  iii) ensuring that the conditions of use are appropriate to 
the risks involved; 
  iv) extension of the flexibility of the Directive so it can 
be more easily adapted to technical progress by regulatory 
Committee procedure. 
  In line with these objectives, this will mean that it will 
continue to make full use of the inherent flexibility of the 
Directive with the help of a regulatory committee, i.e. 
by: 

  -  Preparing a Decision redefining the risk categories of 
GMOs through the revision of Annex II; 
  -  Revising the guidelines 
for classification as established under Article 4.2 of the 
Directive as a result of the discussion undertaken for amending 
the criteria of Annex II; 
  -  Further exploiting the need to adapt 
safety assessment parameters, containment measures and required 
information for technical progress. 

  The evidence and experience also indicate that the 
functioning of the Directive could be further improved, mainly 
by refocusing administrative procedures on activities presenting 
a risk to human health and the environment. This can only be 
achieved by proposing a number of amendments, since the 
Directive does not provide for such adaptations. Amendments 
will therefore be prepared, aimed at: 

  -  Replacing the consent 
requirements by record-keeping, or notification for information 
purposes, for certain low-risk activities; 
  -  Replacing the 
explicit consent requirements by implicit consent for certain 
higher-risk activities; 
  -  Reduction of time periods involved in 
implicit/explicit consent procedures; 
  -  Adapting the present risk 
classification system for GMOs, in accordance with new safety 
considerations; 
  -  Removal of the differentiation between 
activities in research laboratories and production plants. 

  In order to increase flexibility, the Commission will 
propose 
the possibility of adapting the definitions contained within the 
scope of the Directive via a Committee procedure, as is, for 
example, at present foreseen in the case of pharmaceutical 
legislation. 
  The Commission will make these proposals before the European 
Council to be held in Essen in December 1994, and will undertake 
broad consultation with Member State authorities and interest 
groups before doing so, the Communication says. 
  As for Directive N 90/220, the Communication says the 
Commission has already made a number of technical changes 
reflecting the evidence acquired from the wide number of GMO 
releases in the plant area which were not shown to pose any 
specific risks. But on the "improvements" to the Directive 
which the Commission deems necessary, it has not drawn up its 
proposals because it says "further experience is necessary in 
order to determine the right balance between the need for 
safety, public reassurance, and the minimum restraint on 
industry and research work." 
  The Communication also outlines other aspects of the 
Commission's programme to assist the growth of the biotechnology 
industry. These include strengthening the scientific advice 
available to the Commission; coordinating research and 
development programmes between Member States; undertaking 
Community initiatives and supporting small- and medium-sized 
businesses; improving the investment climate and raising public 
awareness of new technology.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/ADB: "Navy Soon To Have Four </F>
Ultramodern Minesweepers"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 2 Jun (BELGA) -- On Thursday [2 June], the 
Belgian Navy provided a glimpse of what to expect from the new 
ultramodern coastal minesweepers (KMV), four of which it intends 
to acquire in the next few years. 
  The study stage is now completed, the military weekly VOX 
reports in its latest edition. The contractual stage has now 
begun with an invitation to tender published a couple of weeks 
ago and addressed to shipyards able to build these vessels, a 
naval spokesman told BELGA. 
  These four vessels will replace about 30 existing 
minesweepers of two types, built about 40 years ago: The MSO's 
[Minesweeper, Ocean], such as the Breydel type dispatched to the 
Persian Gulf in 1988 during the Iranian-Iraqi war and the MSE's 
built of wood. The Navy originally planned to buy 10 of these 
minesweepers, but this figure was reduced to four following the 
Army restructuring decided by the government in January 1993. 
  VOX reports that the four new KMV's, like the existing 
tripartite minesweepers, will be fitted with a hull of composite 
materials (glass fibre and resin) which sharply reduces the 
emission of sound waves and the magnetic field in the water. 
These two characteristics are particularly important for a 
vessel required to operate in close proximity to mines detonated 
by sound waves or magnetic force. 
  They will also be fitted with a totally new sweeping system, 
which will allow it to very precisely imitate the sound wave or 
magnetic force of a vessel targeted by the mines. 
  The Navy reports that these new minesweepers can also be 
used 
for fishing control missions, combating sea pollution, and 
surveying the sea bed and objects lying on it. 
  These new minesweepers will be weigh around 650 tons and 
will 
measure about 50 meters long and 10.5 meters wide. Their speed 
is estimated at 15 knots (about 27 km) per hour, VOX reports. 
  Thanks to the advanced automation of equipment, the future 
minesweepers will need a crew of just 27. Existing minesweepers 
have a crew of 76. 
  The purchase of these new coastal minesweepers is one of the 
principal elements in the national defense investment plan for 
the medium term as adopted in July 1993, to which 12.6 billion 
Belgian francs have been allocated. 
  By the terms of the invitation to tender, the construction 
of 
these four new vessels will be the subject of a freely 
negotiated contract. A prototype will first be built and 
delivered before production of three "standard" vessels. 
  The first minesweeper should be ready by 1998. The three 
others could be launched by the beginning of the next century. 
  The Navy reports that this minesweeping program is now a 
purely national program, following the withdrawal of the 
Netherlands, which had helped fund the feasibility study. 
Portugal had observer status within the Belgo-Netherlands 
working party which drew up the specifications for these new 
vessels.

<F P=106> [Ian Black article: "Britain To Lift Arms Embargo on </F>
Israel"] 
  [Text] Britain is lifting the arms embargo it imposed on 
Israel after its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and promises to 
review a similar ban applied to Syria in the light of progress 
in the Middle East peace process, it was announced yesterday. 
  Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, said in answer to a 
parliamentary question that the embargo -- the last maintained 
against the Jewish state by any European Union member -- should 
be lifted now that Israel has handed over Gaza and Jericho to 
the Palestine Liberation Organisation. 
  In a statement that will please Israel as much as it will 
anger Arab governments, he said: "The Israeli Government has 
made it clear that it has no territorial claim on Lebanon." 
  Israel withdrew most of its combat forces in 1985 but still 
occupies a strip of south Lebanon which it calls the "security 
zone" and uses as a trip-wire against guerrilla attacks. It has 
refused to comply with United Nations resolutions calling for 
withdrawal, citing the inability of the Lebanese government to 
keep peace on the border. 
  Mr Hurd said that all future applications for the sale of 
arms to Israel would be considered on a case by case basis. 
  "These include whether a proposed transfer would be likely 
to 
increase tension in the region or contribute to regional 
instability," he said. 
  Sources in the Foreign Office -- long considered by 
supporters of Israel to have a distinct pro-Arab bias -- made it 
clear that the timing of the move should be seen in the context 
of domestic politics and the forthcoming European elections. 
  For Israel the British arms ban has long been of symbolic 
rather than practical importance since most of its weapons are 
supplied by the United States. But the end of the embargo could 
clear the way for Britain to buy Israel's Popeye missile. 
  This was indirectly confirmed in Jerusalem by Israel's 
deputy 
foreign minister, Yossi Beilin, who met Mr Hurd in London two 
weeks ago. 
  "The significance of the cancellation of the embargo is that 
it had been very difficult for us to sell Israeli weapons in 
Britain because in many cases there was a formal or informal 
condition that some of the components be British," he told 
Israel Radio. "It will now be that much easier." 
  Mr Hurd balanced his announcement with a clear hint that the 
wider European Union arms embargo against Syria could also be 
lifted. 
  "We hope to see progress on the Syrian track in line with 
that seen on the Palestinian track" he said. "In that context 
we will be ready to raise with our European partners the lifling 
of the European Union arms embargo against Syria." 
  That embargo was imposed in 1986 after a Syrian intelligence 
agent, Nezar Hindawi, was convicted of trying to plant a bomb on 
an Israeli airliner at Heathrow airport. Britain severed 
relations with Syria but the links were restored later. 
  Syria and Lebanon last week condemned Israel after its 
forces 
kidnapped a Shiite Muslim guerilla leader from his home in south 
Lebanon to hold as hostage in exchange for an Israeli airman 
believed held by militant Lebanese.

<F P=106> [Article by Colin Brown and Patricia Wynn Davies: "Tory </F>
Attack Over EU Veto Flusters Lib Dem Leaders"] 
  [Text] The Conservative Party yesterday took the 
unprecedented step of picketing the headquarters of the Liberal 
Democrats to create further mischief about Britain's "veto" on 
decisions in the EU (European Union) Council of Ministers. 
  A young man from Conservative Central Office stood under a 
multi-coloured golfing brolly outside the Cowley Street 
headquarters of the Liberal Democrats, handing out leaflets and 
asking all visitors: "Have you got copies of Sir Norman Fowler's 
letter?" 
  The letter by the Conservative Party chairman challenged 
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, to admit his party 
would do away with the British veto, which the Tories have 
placed at the centre of their European election campaign. 
  "You have never been shy to spell this out in the past and I 
am afraid it is too late to change your position now simply 
because it is unpopular with the British public," Sir Norman 
said. 
  The tactic of attacking their opponents on the veto has 
proved a strong card for the Tories, who have the weakest hand 
in the elections. It is unlikely to save the Tories from losses 
on 9 June, but it has put the other parties on the defensive. 
The Tory attack also has forced Labour and Liberal Democrats to 
defend the veto more strongly than they might have wished. 
  The Conservatives were accused by Labour of spreading a lie 
after claiming Labour would abandon the veto on immigration, 
allowing more foreigners into Britain. 
  Mr Ashdown told a campaign meeting in Taunton this week that 
the ability of one country to block decisions in Brussels was a 
recipe for "European sclerosis." But, under intensive Tory 
attack, he yesterday appeared to shift his party's policy by 
confirming the Liberal Democrats would retain the veto on 
"executive" issues, such as the budget, extending VAT, or the 
national rebate. 
  The Tories pointed out the "executive" veto was not 
mentioned 
in the Liberal Democrat manifesto, published on Monday [23 May]. 
That states the use of qualified majority voting in the council 
should be extended and the system reformed, perhaps by the use 
of a "double majority," for example requiring three-quarters of 
the states plus the votes of states representing three-quarters 
of the EU's population. 
  Mr Ashdown's apparent shift on policy was alleged to have 
caused tension in the Liberal Democrat camp. Sir David Steel, 
the party's foreign affairs spokesman, was sticking to the 
agreed party line, that the EU would be "stultified" if it did 
not abandon the veto in favour of qualified majority voting. 
  At a press conference in London, Charles Kennedy, the 
Liberal 
Democrat president, denied any confusion. He was asked why the 
Liberal Democrats had not sought to campaign positively on the 
abandonment of the veto? 
  "We have been positive," he said. "We want more qualified 
majority voting. At the end of the day, you will still have an 
effective veto, providing you can build a consensus with other 
member-states. That is a consistent position." 
  The Liberal Democrats hit back with a report highlighting 
divisions between the Tory party at Westminster and Tory Members 
of the European Parliament, who take a more federalist line.

<F P=106> [Owen Bowcott article: "Dublin Shift Exposes Voice Ban to </F>
Critics"] 
  [Text] One of the actors who regularly impersonates Gerry 
Adams on the airwaves is also believed to provide the voice-over 
for anti-terrorist television advertisements by the Northern 
Ireland Office. 
  Such coincidences are the product of the Government's 
six-year-old ban on broadcasting the spoken words of Sinn Fein 
politicians. The revoicing of Mr Adams's interview on Radio 4's 
Today programme yesterday morning was a typical application of 
the rule. 
  The ban was based on the Irish Government's long-standing 
broadcast restrictions, but Dublin's decision to lift the ban 
earlier this year has left London increasingly exposed to 
criticism from international civil rights groups. Dick Spring, 
the Irish foreign affairs minister, referred to the ban in 
January as "a crude form of censorship." 
  Introduced after the Ballygawley coach bombing in 1988 -- 
when six young soldiers were killed by the IRA -- its original 
purpose was according to Lady Thatcher, to deprive the 
"apologists of terrorism of the oxygen of publicity." 
  In his most recent intervention on the issue last autumn, 
the 
Prime Minister fiercely attacked the way in which broadcasters 
were interpreting the ban. The sophisticated "lip-synching" of 
television interviews with Sinn Fein officials was making a 
nonsense of the restrictions, he claimed. Their voices appeared 
almost unaltered. 
  The regulations were reviewed again. The Heritage Department 
this year announced that although the process would be monitored 
carefully it did not intend to change the rules. 
  It has been alleged that some cabinet members, such as 
Douglas Hurd, now favour removing the restrictions altogether. 
  The European Commission on Human Rights this month rejected 
a 
challenge to the regulations by the National Union of 
Journalists. 
  The BBC has revealed that it pays actors 120 pounds a time 
for re-voicing the words of Sinn Fein officials but declines to 
name any of those who have volunteered their services. 
  In news and current affairs reports there is often not the 
time to ring around for an Equity card holder and those with 
similar accents closer at hand are sometimes press-ganged into 
providing the voice track. 
  One undoubted effect of the broadcasting ban has been to 
provide the republican movement with a political grievance to 
exploit. 
  Several years ago a rather unsubtle hoarding was erected on 
a 
derelict building on the Falls Road. It portrayed an IRA gunman 
in a balaclava carrying a semiautomatic weapon. Along the 
barrel of the gun the caption read: "Uncensored."

<F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "An IRA Wolf Adjusts His </F>
Disguise"] 
  [Text] Gerry Adams's "positive response" to the British 
Government's "elucidation" of the Downing Street Declaration 
does not mean that peace is on the way. All it means is that 
the IRA wolf feels the need, right now, to adjust its sheep's 
clothing. Its bloodstained snout was showing, and even the most 
gullible were beginning to notice. 
  The sheep's clothing is, of course, Sinn Fein, the political 
and propaganda front of the IRA. The adjuster is the president 
of Sinn Fein, Gerry Adams. Mr Adams is, to our misfortune, an 
extremely skilled operator. Over the Downing Street 
Declaration, both on the run-up to it and in its aftermath, Mr 
Adams played a blinder. He succeeded in becoming widely 
accepted as essentially a man of peace, while remaining the 
known head of the political arm of a terrorist organisation. It 
would be hard to parallel that achievement, just as it would be 
hard to parallel the complacent fatuity of the two governments 
whose craven compliance made it possible. 
  All the same, even for such a virtuoso as Mr Adams, the 
conduct of a peace process in harness with a continuing campaign 
of terror is a demanding business. The peace fans were 
beginning to be a bit restive by the time five months of 
continuing IRA terror had followed a Downing Street Declaration 
which the poor suckers had been led to believe would result in a 
permanent cessation of violence. To keep his Orwellian peace 
process in being, for the benefit of the killers whom he serves, 
Gerry Adams needed some new tricks, and he has now come up with 
some plausible ones. These are contained in the present comedy 
of clarification/elucidation into which the British Government 
allowed itself to be drawn by Mr Adams, through his 
indefatigable intermediaries, John Hume and Albert Reynolds. 
  It worked this way: Mr Adams allowed it to be known, through 
that ever-dependable grapevine, that if he got positive answers 
to some of the questions which he would put to the British 
Government, he would make a conciliatory response to the British 
answers as a whole. From previous experience, he knew that both 
the Irish and British Governments would fall for that one, since 
it would enable them to claim that the Downing Street peace 
process, for which they had made such extravagant claims, was 
beginning to show results. 
  Mr Adams was not disappointed. Sinn Fein's 20 questions were 
worked over by Irish and British officials, supplied with 
specifications by Mr Hume, briefed by Mr Adams, as to the 
minimum required to elicit a conciliatory response from Sinn 
Fein. Mr Adams did not ask for too much. He knows the British 
are not yet ready to abandon the guarantee to the majority in 
Northern Ireland that there shall be no constitutional change in 
the status of their province without their consent. For the 
moment, Mr Adams just wanted small things, which would give him 
an opportunity to sound conciliatory in reply, thus remaining 
central to the peace process and supplying decent cover for that 
unsightly snout. 
  The most welcome aspect of the replies, for Sinn Fein, is 
that London replied at all. Earlier, John Major had haughtily 
refused Sinn Fein's request for clarifications, saying "take it 
or leave it". Now he has meekly filled in the Sinn Fein 
questionnaire. To Sinn Fein-IRA, this change demonstrates a 
promising flexibility under the pressure of its own continuing 
armed struggle -- the reality behind the peace process. Further 
demonstrations of flexibility will be sought, by the same 
well-tried methods. 
  A whiff of Sinn Fein-IRA's real thinking can be picked up 
from a report in yesterday's IRISH TIMES of an interview with "a 
senior republican source in West Belfast." The source said -- 
"The British answers to our questions showed that at present 
they are not prepared to move on the key issues, which are the 
Unionist veto and their (British Government's) becoming 
persuaders (of the Unionists) for Irish unity.... We are nowhere 
near the conditions that would merit a cease-fire. (But) we 
don't want to be negative -- that's why statements went out 
offering limited praise of the British response.... We have to 
keep the peace process alive, yet stress that the British 
haven't offered enough." 
  In Northern Ireland, the Unionist community feels the screws 
tightening on it, through the continuation of the IRA's armed 
struggle and a peace process centring on Sinn Fein. 
Predictably, the loyalist paramilitaries are increasingly 
active. Overall, violent incidents, by both sets of 
paramilitaries, increased in the four months following the 
Downing Street Declaration, compared with the equivalent months 
of the previous year. Last weekend, some loyalists were sniping 
at members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], while others 
were attempting a bombing operation against a Sinn Fein-IRA pub 
in Dublin. 
  The attempt was unsuccessful, but a young doorman, Martin 
Doherty, was shot in the course of it. His funeral rites 
provided the occasion for the most open IRA demonstrations 
Dublin has known for many years: probably since the foundation 
of the state, 73 years ago. The IRISH TIMES ran a big 
photograph of the paramilitary funeral on its front page. The 
opposition denounced the Government and the gardai for failing 
to respond to this open paramilitary challenge to the authority 
of the state. In return, Martin McGuinness, at the interment of 
Doherty's remains, denounced the opposition leaders as 
"quislings." In that paramilitary context, that term has an 
ominous ring. 
  Sinn Fein has gained enormously in perceived legitimacy in 
the republic in the months since the Downing Street Declaration. 
Now Sinn Fein's masters, the IRA itself, are seeking to emerge 
openly as defenders of the people against the loyalist violence 
that they themselves have provoked and continue to provoke. 
  There is some daft talk at present of including the loyalist 
paramilitaries, as well as the IRA, in the peace process. What 
is really needed is to shake off the delusive peace process and 
deal with both sets of paramilitary godfathers, not as 
politicians to be conciliated but as terrorists to be brought 
under control. That may yet happen, but I fear that the growing 
violence will be allowed to get worse before the governments see 
through the peace process.

<F P=106> [Michael Evans report: "British Firms Fight To Replace </F>
Hercules With European Rival"] 
  [Text] A European aircraft that could replace the American 
Hercules and carry more equipment and soldiers to a war zone is 
at the centre of a dispute involving the Ministry of Defence and 
the Treasury. 
  The MoD [Ministry of Defense] wants to replace the RAF's 
[Royal Air Force] ageing fleet of C130 Hercules transport 
aircraft and is looking favourably at an American option, an 
updated version of the C130J plane developed by Lockheed. 
  However, the Ministry is under increasing pressure to 
re-examine a European alternative, the Future Large Aircraft. 
It is claimed that the plane, still on the drawingboard, will 
be able to carry twice as much tonnage per day as the Hercules. 
  Yesterday the British firms involved in the seven-nation 
European aircraft accused the Ministry of unfair conduct by 
failing to subject the Hercules replacement programme to proper 
competition. 
  The Government withdrew from the Future Large Aircraft 
project in 1989 and is considering two options: refurbishing the 
present Hercules fleet or replacing 30 of the RAF's C130 
aircraft with the updated C130J model. 
  Yesterday the principal British companies involved in the 
European project. The British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and Short 
Brothers, claimed that 7,500 jobs would be at stake if the 
Defence Ministry went for the American option. British 
Aerospace factories at Prestwick in Scotland and Filton in 
Bristol could be threatened. 
  The Hercules replacement programme looks set to become the 
latest project to run into arguments over jobs and the relative 
merits of American and European aerospace technology. 
  In 1986 it was decided to abandon the British-designed 
Nimrod 
airborne early warning aircraft after more than 900 million 
pounds had been spent, in favour of American AWACs. 
  Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said it 
was 
time the MoD looked more closely at the strategic implications 
of procurement policy. "This is too big a decision to be left 
to RAF and the procurement executive," he said. 
  There was also concern that the Treasury would be against 
developing a new transport aircraft when there was an updated 
Hercules available to buy off the shelf. 
  Yesterday the British companies said it would be more 
economic in the long term to give some of the present Hercules 
planes "minimum refurbishment" and stat replacing the whole 
fleet with the future Large Aircraft from 2002. 
  Mr Evans said that the Future Large Aircraft was being 
designed as a tactical long-rang transport plane to meet the 
requirement of the 21st century and Britain could not afford to 
lose the opportunity of being involved in the programme. 
  He predicted that world-wide sales of about 700 of the 
aircraft would earn Britain 12.8 billion pounds with a per cent 
stake in the overall programme. 
  The countries currently committed to the Future Large 
Aircraft Programme are France, German, Italy, Spain, Portugal 
and Turkey. Although Britain withdrew, British Aerospace and 
other companies are still involved. 
  British Aerospace said the Future Large Aircraft would be 
able to carry 20 per cent more types of equipment than the 
Hercules, including the Warrior armoured vehicle, the multiple 
launch rocket system, the FG70 155 millimeter gun and Chinook 
helicopter.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Ministry of Defense: "New </F>
Order for ASRAAM Missiles"] 
  [Text] A follow-on order for Advanced Short-Range 
Air-to-Air Missiles [ASRAAM] for the RAF [Royal Air Force] has 
been placed with British Aerospace (Dynamics), Jonathan Aitken, 
minister of state for defence procurement, confirmed today. 
  Replying to a written parliamentary question from Angela 
Knight MP (Erewash), Mr. Aitken said: 
  "I am pleased to report that the contract for development 
and 
production of an initial batch of ASRAAM awarded to British 
Aerospace in March 1992 is proceeding well. Progress to date 
has been satisfactory; British Aerospace have met all major 
milestones, and the programme remains on schedule to meet the in 
service date of December 1998. 
  "I am also pleased to announced that, following a recent 
review of the operational requirements of the RAF's Harrier and 
new European Fighter aircraft, the contract for the follow-on 
order of a further quantity of missiles, announced in "Statement 
on the Defence Estimates 1994," has been awarded to British 
Aerospace. 
  This represents an important endorsement of the programme by 
the government, is an excellent fillip for British Aerospace in 
their continuing efforts to promote the exportability of the 
missile and, with the order valued at some 66 million pounds, 
is, in itself, excellent news for British industry."

<F P=106> [Article by Gillian Tett and Philip Coggan: "Order Books at </F>
Five-Year High, CBI Survey Finds"] 
  [Text] British companies reported the highest monthly 
level of factory orders for five years in May, providing fresh 
evidence that the economic recovery is feeding through to the 
manufacturing sector. 
  In a further sign of growing business confidence, a 
Confederation of British Industry [CBI] survey also found that 
manufacturers expect a strong increase in output over the coming 
months. 
  But this upbeat picture of economic recovery was slightly 
marred by new money supply statistics that hint at possible 
inflationary pressures. The latest figures for notes in 
circulation released by the Bank of England yesterday, suggested 
next week's statistics would show dramatic growth in M0, the 
narrowest measure of money supply. 
  The total value of British bank notes in circulation in the 
week to May 25 was 6.7 per cent higher than a year ago. Using 
those statistics, and numbers from previous weeks, Mr Nigel 
Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International 
(Europe), estimates that annual M0 growth in May will jump to 
7.1 per cent in May, from 6.2 per cent in April. The 
government's monitoring range is 0-4 per cent. 
  Any such rise is likely to fuel concern that inflationary 
pressure could potentially undermine recovery, and increase 
speculation about a rise in interest rates. Earlier this month 
the Bank of England expressed some concern about rapid M0 growth 
in its latest inflation report. 
  Although the report said the acceleration in M0 growth had 
been prompted by low interest rates, which encourage consumers 
to hold cash, it noted that "the longer M0 grows at well above 
the top of its monitoring range, the greater the concern about 
the implications for future inflation." 
  These inflationary concerns were yesterday played down by 
the 
CBI. Its latest economic forecast, released today, predicts 
steady, low inflation, economic recovery during this year and 
next, and says there is little evidence yet of any pick-up in 
wage earnings. 
  Meanwhile, the CBI's industrial trends survey, also released 
today, suggests that price pressures remained fairly weak in 
manufacturing in spite of the pick-up in output. 
  Although slightly more companies now expect to be able to 
increase prices over the next four months than reduce them, this 
proportion is lower than a year ago, and only fractionally 
higher than in previous months. The survey covers companies 
accounting for about half of the total UK manufacturing output. 
  Elsewhere, the survey suggests that overseas demand is 
contributing to the improvement in company order books. 
Although export order books are still running at levels 
companies consider below normal, they are at their best levels 
since 1990, the survey said. 
  Medium-sized companies which employ between 200 and 500 
people, reported the best levels of output and export, 
especially those supplying components and raw materials. 
  But business confidence was high across most sectors, with 
36 
per cent of companies expecting to see an increase in output 
volume over the coming months.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union) sticks to his view that a German head of 
government should not attend the celebrations of the former 
Allies in commemoration of the landing in Normandy. "This is 
not the day on which the German chancellor would be in the right 
place there," Kohl said in Munich on Friday [3 June]. The 
meeting in northern France next Monday will be attended by heads 
of state and government of the former anti-Hitler coalition. 
  As an example of how this occasion should make "one look 
forward," Kohl cited the meeting that he and French President 
Francois Mitterrand have agreed to hold in Heidelberg two days 
later. There "a festival of friendship will take place with 
thousands of young people," he said at a lecture at the 
Christian Democratic Union's Economic Advisory Council.

  [Text] Neusaess (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Chairman Theo Waigel on Saturday [4 June] called on the Czech 
Government to dissociate itself from the "Benes decrees that are 
contrary to international law" and to repeal them. The decrees 
signed by Czechoslovak President Eduard Benes after the end of 
World War II were the legal basis for the expropriation and 
expulsion of many Sudeten Germans. 
  Waigel, who addressed 660 members of the CSU working group 
"Union of Expellees" in Neusaess near Augsburg, dealt with the 
wish of East European states to become members of the European 
Union (EU). The CSU is "open to it." However, as Waigel 
further stressed, these states would also have to be prepared to 
accept the European legal system with the relevant law on ethnic 
groups and expellees. 
  As spokesman of the Sudeten German ethnic group, Franz 
Neubauer stressed that the right to one's homeland includes the 
right to return. "It is not decisive how many will really make 
use of it."

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union -- CDU) has welcomed the declaration of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] in favor of the 
continuation of the Bonn coalition. "I am impressed by the high 
result of FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel," Kohl said at the Christian 
Democratic Union land conference in Berlin on Saturday [4 June], 
referring to the vote of the FDP Federal Party Congress in 
Rostock the day before. On Kinkel's initiative, a vast majority 
of the liberals had advocated there the continuation of the 
CDU/FDP coalition after the Bundestag election on 16 October.

  [Excerpts] Rostock (DPA) -- After their definitive vote to 
continue the coalition with the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU], the Free Democratic Party 
[FDP] clearly dissociated itself from the CDU/CSU on important 
political questions at its Rostock party congress. On Saturday 
[4 June], the approximately 660 delegates adopted large parts of 
an election program in which they advocate the strengthening of 
the rights of foreigners, oppose the electronic bugging of 
apartments, and support the abolition of the church tax. 
Against the resistance of the party leadership, the delegates 
also called for the division of parliamentary mandates and 
government offices. 
  On the sidelines of the deliberations, FDP Chairman Klaus 
Kinkel announced that, irrespective of the statement in favor of 
a coalition, the FDP will conduct an independent election 
campaign. He stressed that, for the FDP, the election program 
will be the basis for negotiations on a coalition with the 
CDU/CSU. Referring to opinion polls, according to which it is 
uncertain that the liberals will return to the European 
Parliament and the Bundestag, Kinkel said that he is convinced 
the FDP will achieve good results. [passage omitted] 
  The party congress advocated the development of peacekeeping 
and peacemaking UN missions. Germany's unrestricted 
participation in these missions will be made possible by a Basic 
Law amendment. The adherence to compulsory military service was 
affirmed.

  [Text] Brandenburg (DPA) -- Approximately 10 adolescents 
were temporarily detained at a rally with Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
(Christian Democratic Union) in the Havel city of Brandenburg on 
Saturday evening [4 June]. Some of them had broken through a 
barrier and loudly protested against the chancellor's speech. 
  At the rally with 5,000 participants, Kohl had called for 
participation in building a joint European home. Only the 
"United States of Europe" guarantees peace and freedom, Kohl 
stated in his speech one week before the European elections. 
His comments were accompanied by violent booing and a chorus of 
whistles. On banners, citizens opposed the expulsion of eastern 
Germans from their plots. 
  The chancellor said that the reduction of unemployment is 
the 
greatest challenge of the country's community of solidarity. 
Unemployment will not disappear overnight, but it can be warded 
off. At the same time, Kohl admitted mistakes in shaping German 
unity and substantiated them by a lack of experience.

  [Text] Potsdam/Bonn (DPA) -- The extreme-right "Dragon 
Military Sports Group," which operated out of the Prenzlau area, 
has been broken up in Brandenburg Land. The Potsdam Public 
Prosecutor's Office in response to a question confirmed a report 
in BERLINER MORGENPOST on Saturday [4 June]. Senior Public 
Prosecutor Ruediger Michalik from the Potsdam Public 
Prosecutor's Office said an arrest warrant has been issued for 
the chief of the group, a 33-year-old Bundeswehr noncommissioned 
officer. It is strongly suspected that a criminal organization 
was founded and that the law on arms was violated. 
  Four other members of the military sports group who were 
temporarily detained -- an adolescent and three young adults -- 
have meanwhile been released. They have to be categorized with 
the extreme-right scene, it was stated. In a raid by more than 
100 policemen from various police headquarters, the five had 
been arrested last Thursday. According to Michalik, 
extreme-right documents, neonazi propaganda material, weapons, 
ammunition, a bayonet, and a Third Reich war flag were 
confiscated when 15 objects in the area of Prenzlau were 
searched. 
  The objective of the military sports group had been attacks 
on foreigners and the homes of asylum-seekers. The group, which 
carried out military sports exercises in the woods, had been 
watched for several months, Michalik said. 
  Alfred Biehle, military commissioner of the Bundestag, said 
in a DPA interview that, despite some extreme-right phenomena, 
there is no shift to the right in the German armed forces. 
According to his information, this year 14 suspicious cases 
with 20 presumed perpetrators have been registered in the field 
of right-wing extremism and xenophobic behavior of soldiers. 
Last year, 53 suspicious cases with 63 presumed perpetrators 
had been ascertained in the Bundeswehr, he said. 
  Defense Ministry spokesman Hans-Dieter Wichter stated that 
extreme-right and extreme-left activities of soldiers are 
strictly prosecuted. This would also apply to the case reported 
from Brandenburg if the suspicion against the noncommissioned 
officer were confirmed, he said.

  [Editorial Report] An unattributed article in the 27 April 
Paris daily LIBERATION comments on an extensive list of 
potential presidential candidates. The following are described 
as "probable" candidates: 
  --Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard, 63, who had to 
set aside his ambitions in 1981 and 1988 for Francois 
Mitterrand's sake. The article notes that he will surely not 
renounce the race this time. His "mediocre" popularity scores 
are a disadvantage. Despite his success in "marginalizing" his 
most serious PS opponent, Laurent Fabius, Rocard is not "immune 
to a Delors operation." 
  --Valery Giscard d'Estaing, 68, who will only announce his 
candidacy if he is "almost" sure of success. His low popularity 
scores "do not overly worry him," for he is convinced he could 
recoup in a few months. While no French Democratic Union (UDF) 
official would counter his plans, part of the party's younger 
wing would hesitate to support him. 
  --Edouard Balladur, 65, whose popularity soared after the 
GATT negotiations were concluded but who has "piled up errors 
and missteps since." To oppose Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
leader Jacques Chirac and appear as a "unifier" and not a 
"divider," Balladur should delay his presidential race as much 
as possible, the article notes. 
  --Jacques Chirac, 61, the RPR's "natural" candidate, is "not 
quite sure" of how to distance himself from Balladur, but is 
"breathing easier" now that the prime minister has dropped in 
the polls. Announcing his candidacy too early may be risky, and 
doing so too late may make it impossible to overtake Balladur. 
  --National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, 65, who will 
present himself as an "outsider." While he obtained 14.39 
percent of the vote when he first ran in 1988, his position is 
not as favorable today, and even the Left deprives him of 
publicity by not disrupting his meetings. 
  The following are listed by the article as "possible" 
candidates: 
  --Raymond Barre, 70, considered a "statesman" by UDF leader 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Insisting he is a "free man," Barre 
will decide alone whether to run for the 1995 presidential 
elections. Having "obstinately" avoided the parties, it is 
probable he will not actively support a candidate. 
  --Minister of Defense Francois Leotard, 52, has long thought 
that the 1995 presidential elections will afford him the 
opportunity to "test the waters." After some initial 
hesitation, Leotard and his Republican Party (PR) have decided 
to support Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's "unifying" 
candidacy if he runs. Should Balladur stay out of the race, 
Leotard will become a candidate if he can obtain the support of 
UDF "heavyweights" such as Giscard and Senate President Rene 
Monory. 
  --Rene Monory, who "suggests nothing, excludes nothing, 
denies nothing." He would be Giscard's candidate if the UDF 
leader decided not to run. 
  --Generation Ecologie's Brice Lalonde, 48, expected to run 
in the first round to "better negotiate" a ministerial post in 
the second. Some of his old friends contend he is waiting for 
the results of initial public opinion polls to decide whether he 
should run. 
  --The Greens' Dominique Voynet, 35, who does not hide her 
desire to run since she wrested power from Antoine Waechter. 
She would perhaps support the Left's candidate in the second 
round to facilitate alliances for the municipal elections. 
  --PS luminary Bernard Tapie, 51. Tapie hopes that good 
results in the forthcoming European Parliament elections will 
support his ambitions and make him the Socialists' "inevitable" 
candidate. 
  --European Union (EU) Commission President Jacques Delors, 
68, has consistently said that he will not run against PS leader 
Michel Rocard. This would not prevent his supporters from 
relaunching the idea of his candidacy if Rocard, down in the 
polls, loses in the Euroelections. 
  --PS dissident and Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, 53, whose candidacy hangs on his Euroelections 
score. 
  --Communist Party (PCF) leader Robert Hue, 47, whose primary 
aim is to come out of isolation to facilitate leftist alliances 
for the municipal elections. 
<H5>  Balladur' s Losses Explained </H5>
  According to Denis Jeambar writing in the 23 April Paris 
weekly LE POINT, Balladur's initial "state of grace" may well 
have been an "illusion" whose impact was overestimated. "In 
mourning" after the crumbling of Socialism and the suicide of 
the late Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy and "in shock" over the 
recession and unemployment, the country at the time of the 
elections only wished for "calm and the kind of political 
silence that Balladur ideally embodied," Jeambar explains. 
Balladur changed this situation with his "very political" law 
on secular education and the attempt by Social Affairs Minister 
Simone Veil and Minister of Defense Francois Leotard to 
"presidentialize" him. These developments "broke the implicit 
code linking [Balladur] to the French people." Balladur's 
decline has boosted the chances of Chirac, now seen as equally 
"competitive" with the prime minister for a second round 
presidential victory, even if Balladur still seems more favored 
in the first round. However, the "ambivalence" of Balladur's 
past popularity makes the presidential race "much more uncertain 
than figures can tell," Jeambar concludes. 
<H5>  Possible Challenger </H5>
  The results of a SOFRES poll conducted according to the 
quota 
method from 1 to 6 April among 1,000 individuals over 18 are 
reported in the 21-27 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. 
Respondents were asked their opinion of prominent political 
leaders as candidates for president of the Republic. On the 
Right, Balladur led with 47 percent of favorable opinions--a 
drop of 11 points since February--versus 42 percent negative. He 
was followed by RPR leader Chirac (33 percent positive, 61 
percent negative), Raymond Barre (30 percent positive, 64 
percent negative), Interior Minister Charles Pasqua (26 percent 
positive, 68 percent negative), Minister of Social Affairs 
Simone Veil (25 percent positive, 68 percent negative), Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard (23 percent positive, 68 percent 
negative), UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing (22 percent 
positive, 74 percent negative), and a number of other 
personalities with lesser scores. On the Left, Jacques Delors 
led with 47 percent positive versus 42 percent negative, an 
improvement of 4 percent since January. Socialist Party (PS) 
leader Michel Rocard followed with 30 percent positive versus 64 
percent negative (an improvement of 3 percent). The greatest 
improvement (11 percent) was registered by PS luminary Bernard 
Tapie, despite his score of 23 percent positive versus 71 
percent negative. Poll results, according to Bazin, underscore 
"the end of the exceptional case represented by Balladur and the 
rise of the Tapie phenomenon." An analysis of the distribution 
of the two men's popularity reveals that Balladur is rejected by 
the least affluent classes--the young and the workers--among 
whom Tapie registers the most gains. This indicates a new 
cleavage between "the people above and the people below," 
superimposed on the old cleavage between the Right and the Left, 
Bazin comments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Scalfaro at Allied Landing </F>
Commemoration"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Nettuno, June 3 -- Recollection of and 
sympathy for those who died and suffered on all sides in the 
Second World War was at the centre of a speech here on Friday [3 
June] by Italy's President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
  "No one can change history, but pain and human sacrifice can 
never suffer distinctions or divisions," said Scalfaro at a 
memorial service attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
  "I cannot forget that in the division of my country, 
suffering and bloodshed affected other sons of this earth," said 
the head of state. A particular thought was spared for the 
Americans who died in the Salerno, Nettuno and Anzio landings 
"whose young, sacrificed, lives we celebrate today." 
  Affirming that the dead of past wars are calling out for an 
end to current conflicts, Scalfaro recalled how Italy, over the 
past 50 years has always responded "swiftly and generously to 
calls for solidarity and brotherhood between people, in the 
service of liberty and justice, in the same spirit in which it 
was present in the heroic battle for freedom." 
  Calling for nations to be on their guard against "future 
dangers and fears", the president condemned the Second World 
War, "because man chose violence against all reason," and 
because of the existence of "dishonest dictatorships, with the 
hegemony of a `superior race' which massacred brotherly equality 
between people and generated nameless genocide." 
  On the podium alongside Scalfaro were President Clinton and 
his wife Hillary, who were greeted by huge crowds waving Italian 
and American flag as they made their way through Nettuno, 40 km 
south of Rome, where they arrived by helicopter earlier this 
morning. 
  Security officers ran metal detectors over all those wishing 
to enter the war cemetery here for the service to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the Allied landings, a service attended by many 
Italian veterans. 
  Premier Silvio Berlusconi, who was present but did not make 
a 
speech at this morning's ceremony, displayed irritation at 
journalists who wanted to quiz him solely on the domestic 
political situation. "Can't you be a little bit moved for once, 
seeing all these boys who died for Italy," the premier asked the 
press.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Iraq: Italian Health Minister </F>
Appeals to Clinton"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 3 -- The plight of Iraq, which is 
without access to adequate medical supplies due to an 
international embargo, was presented to United States President 
Bill Clinton in a letter from Health Minister Raffaele Costa, 
Friday [3 June]. 
  "More than three years after the end of the war in that 
country, which is now isolated and forgotten, tens of thousands 
of people, including many children, are in a serious condition 
but receive little health care because of insufficient 
medicines," wrote Costa in a letter delivered to the U.S. 
embassy here. 
  "Thousands of people have died or are dying of malnutrition, 
in epidemics, or as a result of the war," said Costa who added 
that humanitarian organisations and Italian President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro were amongst those who have pressed him to act to 
better the lot of suffering Iraqis. 
  According to the health minister "the government there is 
prepared to pay (for medical supplies) but cannot receive them, 
or receives them after a long delay, due to the extremely strict 
controls and major obstacles imposed by the embargo."

<F P=106> [Article signed OM/WI/PI: "Demolition of Experimental </F>
Diorit Nuclear Plant Deemed `Irresponsible' by Swiss Energy 
Federation"] 
  [Text] Zurich, 3 Jun (ATS) -- The demolition of the 
remaining structure of the Diorit experimental reactor, which 
was designed by the Paul Scherrer Institute (IPS), is an 
"irresponsible" decision, according to the Swiss Energy 
Federation (FSE). In a statement released on Friday [3 June], 
it lists the reasons against the plan. The IPS does not share 
this point of view. 
  The Diorit experimental reactor was put into service in 1960 
to develop research in the field of reactor technology. Only 
the structure of the facility, which was closed down in 1977, 
remains. The reactor was dismantled in the 1980's. 
  In its statement, the FSE underlines that no reactor has 
ever 
been eliminated in Switzerland. The Federation fears that the 
five persons who will work during the demolition, which is to 
last two years, will be exposed to excessively high levels of 
radiation. The lack of experience, protection means, and 
equipment are other areas of concern. 
  The IPS admits that it would be easier to carry out this 
operation 15 to 20 years from now. However, it believes that 
the issue should be dealt with quickly so that the next 
generation does not have to worry about it. The institute also 
notes that the radiation level would only be three times higher 
than the average yearly level. The level would total 3 rem for 
two years, while the new federal regulation allows 2 rem per 
year. 
  The demolition of the Diorit reactor will produce 210 cubic 
meters of radioactive waste, according to the IPS. The waste 
will be cast in concrete and stored in Wuerenlingen, the 
institute's headquarters, before being transfered to a storage 
center for low radioactive waste.

resume in July, according to a press release issued by the 
plant's management on Friday. 
  The plant's production reached 98.8 percent of capacity

<F P=106> [Article signed HF/HA/AZ: "Some 15,000 Counterfeited $100 </F>
Banknotes Printed in Schwyz"] 
  [Text] Bern/Munich, 31 May (ATS) - Some 15,000 $100 bills 
were seized a couple of days ago in the German town of 
Sindelfingen. Police forces in Schwyz Canton conducted a search 
of a printing shop and arrested an individual in this case, 
suspected of engaging in counterfeiting activities. 
  The cooperation between the Schwyz police and the judicial 
authorities of Baden-Wurtemberg led to the search of a printing 
shop in Schwyz on Friday [27 May]. This is where the 
counterfeited dollars were manufactured. The value of the 
seizure amounts to approximately 2.1 million Swiss francs. 
Folco Galli, spokesperson of the Federal Department of Justice 
and Police (FDJP), confirmed on Tuesday that the police of the 
canton also arrested the alleged counterfeiter. 
<H5>  The Counterfeiter Resides in Switzerland </H5>
  The counterfeiter, a foreign national living in Switzerland, 
has been remanded in custody in the canton of Schwyz. Interpol 
Germany and Switzerland worked together on this case. The FDJP 
has not provided additional details. 
  Following a long investigation, German police seized $1.5 
million in counterfeit notes in a Sindelfingen hotel last 
Friday. The police also arrested seven persons: One Swiss 
national, four Germans, and two Croats. Two persons, including 
the Swiss national, were released on Tuesday, the Tubingen 
police announced. 
  This case follows another counterfeit case of 1,000 Swiss 
francs [SFr] banknotes seized on Friday in Aschaffenburg, in 
Southern Germany. The value of the seized notes amounted to 
SFr5 million. Dieter Schinzel, German member of the European 
Parliament, was arrested at the time with six accomplices. 
<H5>  Two Genuine Banknotes Per Bundle </H5>
  A small part of the seized banknotes, the first and last of 
each bundle, was genuine, Mr. Galli disclosed on Tuesday. 
However, Swiss authorities have not yet been officially 
assigned this case, although there have been contacts between 
the Munich police and the anticounterfeiting services in Bern. 
  Mr. Schinzel and the seven persons arrested on Friday have 
been remanded in custody. Mr. Schinzel, a member of the 
European Parliament since 1979, has been requested by his party 
to temporarily renounce all his functions or elective mandates. 
He is the president of the Social Democratic Party in Aachen. 
He was not a candidate in the 12 June European elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Prime Minister Welcomed Queen </F>
of the Netherlands in Normandy Yesterday -- Balladur's 
Pro-European Message"] 
  [Excerpts] Sainte-Mere-Eglise -- On the eve of large-scale 
formal commemorations of the Normandy landing, Edouard Balladur 
went to Pont-Audemer and Sainte-Mere-Eglise yesterday to 
congratulate veterans. 
  The prime minister took advantage of the visits to remind 
his 
audience that peace must never be taken for granted and that 
only a strong Europe can protect us from new disasters. 
  "Only with the support of our American allies could West 
Europe rebuild itself and live in peace for 50 years," the prime 
minister said. "Today, the world has changed. The success of 
the West European model, which hinges on freedom, is no longer 
being questioned. The Berlin Wall, which divided our continent, 
is no more." 
  "Europe is undergoing change. This has been cause for 
rejoicing among us. However, such change entails risks as well. 
For the first time since 1945, war has returned to Europe, 
spreading devastation in the former Yugoslavia. On this day of 
commemoration, we must reaffirm our determination not to let 
freedom and the values we all believe in be trampled underfoot." 
<H5>  `Key Foundation' </H5>
  "We also must do everything we can to ensure that such 
situations cannot happen again" the prime minister went on. 
"The Pact for Stability in Europe proposed by France could 
prevent future crises. The European Union must take charge of 
and improve its own defense system, alongside NATO, which will 
remain the key foundation of solidarity between nations on both 
sides of the ocean. Thus defended, and bolstered by democracy 
throughout the continent, the very peace that was restored 50 
years ago will thrive on the indestructible ties born, on both 
sides of the Atlantic, of the belief that we share the same 
values forged in yesterday's ordeals." 
  Edouard Balladur was accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, and War Veterans 
Minister Philippe Mestre. Before he spoke, a few paces from 
Sainte-Mere-Eglise's small church, from whose spire Private John 
Smith's parachute still hangs by way of a symbol, he welcomed 
Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands as well as Netherlands Prime 
Minister Lubbers, who had come to attend a commemoration of the 
city's liberation by Netherlands troops. [passage omitted] 
  In Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the prime minister also congratulated 
at length the U.S. veterans who had just completed their 
parachute jump. Before speaking to the population, he visited 
the war museum, reaffirming his conviction that a strong Europe 
is peace's best safeguard.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dominique Baudis, head of the majority's </F>
"Union" list, by Thierry Portes; place and date not given: 
"Inventing a Model for the European Union"] 
  [Excerpt] [Portes] What do you think is the reason behind 
voter indifference to the campaign, as indicated by opinion 
polls? 
  [Baudis] Europe is too remote an issue for many French 
citizens, who feel that this election has nothing to offer them. 
This is a paradoxical attitude: They bemoan the lack of 
democracy within the European institutions, and when they are 
offered a major opportunity to shape these institutions, half of 
them hesitate to go and vote. I would like our fellow citizens 
to be aware of the importance of the 12 June vote, a one-round 
election, if I may point out. Aware and responsible citizens, 
this is what I hope for, because if we want a European 
Parliament that pulls its weight vis-a-vis the European 
Commission and its bureaucracy, people must vote on 12 June, 
Euro-MP's must be given the legitimacy of the vote. 
  [Portes] If the French seem less interested in the election 
of 12 June than in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, is 
this not because politicians themselves are more interested in 
the presidential election? 
  [Baudis] Indeed, I note that at least five candidates are 
leading a list in the perspective of the next presidential 
election, and not with a view to defending their conception of 
Europe. [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard and 
[National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen have declared 
themselves as presidential candidates. As for Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement [former defense minister], Philippe de Villiers 
[majority's anti-Maastricht list], and Bernard Tapie [Left 
Radical Movement], they have obviously been dreaming about the 
Elysee [office of the president]. 
  [Portes] In your own coalition, several people have also had 
the impending presidential election in mind. 
  [Baudis] I am not in the running and neither is anyone else 
on my list. We have only one goal: We want our list, which is 
the list of the majority and is supported by every single UDF 
[French Democratic Union] and RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
official to come in first on 12 June, so as to give as much 
weight as possible to the majority's European views in the 
European Parliament. 
  [Portes] Does not the quarrel between supporters and 
opponents of the Maastricht Treaty still underscore the European 
debate, both among the Right and the Left? 
  [Portes] This is a thing of the past, and one does not 
integrate Europe while looking back. The referendum took place 
in 1992, and the Maastricht Treaty came into force last 
November. Why reenact a two-year-old debate? Those who 
envision doing so probably oppose European integration. 
  As for our team, it is open, as is France. It includes 
yesterday's Maastricht supporters and opponents, united around 
Europe and in agreement on today's challenges and tomorrow's 
objectives. One excellent feature of the Maastricht Treaty is 
that it provides its a review in 1996. 
  Therefore, as soon as the election is over, we shall prepare 
the changes needed to make Europe more democratic, closer to its 
citizens, less technocratic, and to improve its decisionmaking 
capabilities, among other things as a result of the future 
integration of Austria and the Scandinavian countries. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Eric Dupin: "Opinion Polls: Fragmented and as </F>
Yet Undecided Voters"] 
  [Text] While publicizing new polls is now forbidden, the 
latest surveys highlight two trends: There could be a record 
number of abstentions and the electorate is fragmented due to 
the high number of lists -- a situation that does nothing to 
help [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard. 
  The population has hardly been gripped by the European 
election campaign. Voting intentions have mostly remained 
stable since April. A week before the election, voters remain 
uninterested and relatively undecided. This is probably the 
reason behind the differences in the forecasts published this 
week by the various polling institutes. This also means that 
these last polls -- any new poll is forbidden as of yesterday -- 
do not necessarily reflect the results of the 12 June election. 
Surprises are always possible in a 20-list election which 
should be affected by a high abstention rate. Not to mention 
the fact that many voters (40 percent according to the latest 
IFOP [French Public Opinion Institute] survey) may change their 
mind by election day. 
  According to SOFRES [French Public Opinion Polling Company], 
the participation rate would be 53 percent. However, no one 
denies the possibility that the record abstention figure 
registered for a European election may be broken on 12 June: In 
1989, the participation rate was 49.35 of registered voters. 
Indeed, the proportion of respondents who stated they were 
interested in the European election is lower than it was five 
years ago (54 percent as compared to 56 percent). As usual, 
potential abstentions are found mainly within younger and less 
affluent stratas of the population. 
  Only one list seems to be benefiting from any real campaign 
momentum: that of Philippe de Villiers ["The Other Europe," 
anti-Maastricht list]. Voting intentions in its favor increased 
relatively steadily, from 4 or 5 percent in April to 7 percent 
in the latest BVA [Brulle Ville Associates] survey, 8.5 percent 
in the SOFRES poll, and even 10 percent in the IFOP survey. 
(Footnote 1) (BVA-France/Europe-1 survey from 1 to 3 June among 
1,514 respondents. IFOP/JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE survey on 2 and 3 
June among 818 respondents. SOFRES/TF-1 survey on 2 and 3 June 
among 1,000 respondents.) Mr. de Villiers' list is expected to 
pass easily the 5-percent threshold for entry into the European 
Parliament. It has succeeded in winning over many right-wing 
voters who opposed the Maastricht Treaty. It achieves its best 
results among older and nonsalaried RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
voters. Its supporters seem to be determined enough to confirm 
their voting intention on election day. 
  Those who should be smiling on the evening of 12 June may 
even include Bernard Tapie ["Radical Energy," leftist list]. 
The latest polls credit him with 8 percent (BVA), 8,5 percent 
(SOFRES), or 9 percent (IFOP) of voting intentions. His MRG 
[Left Radical Movement] list no longer seems to be slipping, as 
was the case in late May. Mr. Tapie may benefit from his debate 
with [National Front leader] Jean-Marie Le Pen, in which he 
mostly had the upper hand. However, he may be among the main 
victims of a high abstention rate, since his electorate (young 
and blue collar workers) encompasses those categories that are 
the most likely to abstain. Competition from the "Sarajevo" 
list may also rob him of a few percentage points. 
  The politician that stands to lose the most in this European 
election is Michel Rocard. Hindered by the presence of the 
Tapie and Chevenement ["Alternative Policy"] lists, his 
Socialist list is likely to fare particularly badly if polls are 
anything to go by: 14 percent (IFOP), 15 percent (CSA) 
[expansion unknown], 16 percent (BVA), or 16.5 percent (SOFRES). 
(These statistics, as those mentioned above, take into account 
the "Sarajevo" list led by Leon Schwartzenberg [which was 
withdrawn last week].) The Socialist Party is not even certain 
to improve on its disastrous result of the March 1993 
parliamentary election (17.6 percent of votes). Truth be told, 
European elections have always been a tough test for the 
Socialists. 
  The other "major list" headed by Dominique Baudis 
[majority's 
"Union" list] is less affected by electorate fragmentation. 
With 29 percent (SOFRES), 32 percent (IFOP), and 33 percent 
(BVA) of voting intentions, it falls short of the 39 percent of 
votes won by the UDF [French Democratic Union]-RPR coalition in 
the latest parliamentary election. It has been the main victim 
of the increasing success of Philippe de Villiers' list. At the 
outset of the campaign, some polling institutes saw Mr. Baudis' 
list pull in over 35 percent of votes. The latest polls give 
results perilously close to those of the list headed by Valery 
Giscard d'Estaing in 1989 (28.8 percent). And anything below 33 
percent would be a failure for the majority, which a year ago 
managed to conquer about four seats out of five in the National 
Assembly. 
  Polls predict a relatively stable showing for the National 
Front. Anticipated results for Jean-Marie Le Pen's list are 
highly consistent: 10 percent (BVA) or 11 percent (SOFRES and 
IFOP) of voting intentions. The far Right would thus achieve 
results roughly similar to those of the 1989 European election 
(11.8 percent). The National Front's declining influence in the 
media does not prevent it from benefiting from the continued 
support of an electorate whose loyalty it managed to secure. 
The Communist list led by Francis Wurtz is credited with 5.5 
percent (IFOP), 6.5 percent (SOFRES), or 7 percent (BVA) of 
voting intentions. The French Communist Party [PCF] would thus 
do no better than in the 1989 European election, when its list 
was headed by Philippe Herzog (7.7 percent of votes). The 
European election has traditionally been a difficult one for the 
Communists, who suffer, among other things, from abstention 
among the working classes. Polls indicate that the PCF is in an 
electoral stagnation phase, if not in one of decline. 
  Jean-Pierre Chevenement may be in for a nasty shock on 
Sunday. With 2 percent (BVA), 2.5 percent (IFOP), and 3.5 
percent (SOFRES) of voting intentions, his list is unlikely to 
clear the critical 5 percent mark. Moreover, voters attracted 
to this list are highly likely to change their mind. Mr. 
Chevenement cannot seem to attract "left-wing grumblers" the way 
Mr. de Villiers does "right-wing rebels." 
  As for the Greens [list led by Marie-Anne Isler-Beguin], 
their position is just as serious. Credited with 1.5 percent 
(BVA), 2 percent (IFOP), or 3 percent (SOFRES), they are likely 
to suffer a veritable electoral rout. In 1989, they scored 10.6 
percent of votes! They may even be humiliated by Brice 
Lalonde's ["Ecology Generation") list: Voting intentions for it 
are 2.5 percent (BVA) and 3 percent (SOFRES), but also 5 percent 
(IFOP). The environmentalist movement as a whole is likely to 
pay for its divisions by being kicked out of the European 
Parliament. 
  Last is the unknown quantity that is the "Sarajevo" list. 
The about-face of its initiators complicate the job for 
pollsters. The latest surveys give 2 percent (IFOP), 3 percent 
(SOFRES), and 3.5 percent (BVA) of voting intentions to the list 
led by Leon Schwartzenberg. There is a possibility that it may 
fare less well than the list led by Andre Goustat ("Hunting, 
Fishing, Nature, and Tradition" list], which is credited with 2 
percent (IFOP) to 2.5 percent (BVA and SOFRES) of voting 
intentions.

  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, now turns 
from marking the D-Day anniversary to a round of bilateral 
meetings in France after offering the French an olive branch. 
Linda Mottram reports from France: Mr. Keating stepped back 
from comments last year in a trade row that France had forgotten 
the sacrifice made for it in the Second World War. 
  [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating has praised French 
President Francois Mitterrand for his thanks during the D-Day 
celebrations to those countries whose people fought and died in 
the liberation of Europe in World War II. Mr. Keating says it's 
now clear to him the French have not forgotten the war 
sacrifice, as he had claimed in France last year at the tense 
end of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. 
Mr. Keating's next engagement in France is a meeting with 
President Mitterrand. 
  [Keating] This is a good opportunity, I think, to, you know, 
again go over common ground with the government of France and 
I'll be looking forward to meetings with President Mitterrand 
and Prime Minister Balladur. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Pierre Clerc: "Pakistani President Makes </F>
Case for Nuclear Policy to Francois Mitterrand"] 
  [Excerpt] Returning from a 10-day "private" -- albeit very 
official -- trip to the United States, Pakistani President 
Farooq Leghari had a stopover in Paris, during which time he was 
received for an hour or so on Thursday, 12 June, by French 
President Francois Mitterrand. Elected last November, Mr. 
Leghari, 54, is an old militant from Benazir Bhutto's Pakistani 
People's Party [PPP]. He was PPP secretary from 1978 to 1983 
during the dark days of persecution by the Zia dictatorship. 
This experience enabled this affable man to send President 
Mitterrand greetings from the Pakistani prime minister, whose 
charm was much appreciated by Mr. Mitterrand during his 1990 
trip to Islamabad. 
  According to Mr. Leghari, the two men talked about the 
"nuclear issue." By all appearances, the Pakistani leader 
sought to verify Paris' lack of flexibility in its position on 
supplying a nuclear power plant that had been promised in the 
past, before France shied away after signing the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
  The issue of "nonproliferation" has been in play for a long 
time, since Islamabad, which is strongly perceived as the 
capital of a country which is capable of making "the bomb," or 
which has even been credited with already possessing a dozen of 
them, is being subjected to pressure to sign the NPT, especially 
by the Americans. Mr. Leghari repeated that Pakistan has long 
been prepared to sign if India, the brother and enemy against 
whom three wars have been fought in the past, does the same. 
  "We are prepared to undergo inspections provided that both 
sides are subject to them," he repeated. The problem is that 
New Delhi, which exploded an atomic device in 1974 and which is 
apparently ready to install missiles with nuclear capability 
pointed at Pakistan, has rejected all suggestions which could 
muzzle its security needs, on the grounds that such needs are 
also reflected vis-a-vis China, against which it fought a war in 
1962. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Armament: The Apache Missile </F>
Flies"] 
  [Text] Two air-to-ground Apache missiles, developed by 
Matra-Defense, were carried for the first time under the wings 
of a German Tornado aircraft of the Luftwaffe. The Apache, a 
French version of the cruise missile, employs stealth technology 
and flies at a low altitude. Moreover, the Apache is equipped 
with navigation systems that allow exceptional precision 
targeting. The version ordered by the Luftwaffe and which is 
being developed in the framework of a 2.2-billion French franc 
[Fr] contract (with Fr600 million for adapting the missile) is 
the "antiship submunitions dispenser." The objective is to equip 
the 180 German Tornado planes with those missiles within the 
framework of a modernization program. The final contracts could 
then involve several billion French francs. 
  The development of the Apache, which was initiated in 1989, 
has reached the stage of in-flight testing. The French version, 
intended to be used by the Mirage 2000 D first and then by the 
Rafale, will be operational in 1997. Right now, Matra is 
planning to propose an even more effective version.

<F P=106> [Article signed X.H.: "Economy Is Creating More Jobs Than </F>
It Is Losing"] 
  [Text] The French economy created 25,700 salaried jobs in 
the first quarter of 1994. Of course, we are still a long way 
away from the 191,000 jobs created in the United States in the 
month of April alone. This is the first increase in three 
years. In the first three months of the year, salaried 
employment increased by 0.2 percent according to the final 
figures released by the Ministry of Labor. Not only is France 
creating more jobs than it is losing -- for the first time since 
1990 -- but the final statistics have proven to be better than 
the provisional figures released in mid-May. Some 5,000 extra 
jobs have been listed since then. Moreover, UNEDIC [National 
Union for Employment in Industry and Commerce] is soon expected 
to downwardly revise the number of extra job-seekers expected in 
1994. 
  The tertiary sector, which since mid-May has been playing 
its 
role as a locomotive only very modestly, "is once again clearly 
becoming a creator of jobs," thanks to trade (up 1.3 percent for 
the nonfood retail trade) and service (up 2.4 percent for 
services to businesses). On the other hand, the manufacturing 
industry is continuing to lose jobs (down 0.6 percent), but at a 
more moderate pace than the preceding quarter (down 0.8 percent). 
<H5>  Toward 1 Million Welfare Recipients By The End Of 1994 </H5>
  The number of unemployed people being compensated by UNEDIC 
should not be as high as forecast in 1994, which could encourage 
the implementation of an "active" policy by the unemployment 
insurance system to benefit employment, with the support of 
certain employees' unions. Whereas in March UNEDIC expected 
that it would have to compensate 210,000 extra unemployed people 
this year, this figure should end up being around 100,000. This 
slower rise should be reflected in a financial surplus in the 
unemployment insurance system that exceeds the two billion 
francs forecast for this year. 
  The size of the "outgoings" as noted in UNEDIC registers can 
be explained by the fact that the "groups of unemployed people 
who entered the unemployment insurance system in 1991-1992 used 
up their rights to enter the solidarity insurance system five or 
six months ago," an expert explained. This upsurge in those 
leaving the system should not conceal the fact that the number 
of long-term unemployed rose 23 percent in one year and that the 
average duration of unemployment has now reached 279 days. 
  Out of the 50,000 people who leave the unemployment 
insurance 
system every month, a little less than one-third join the 
solidarity insurance program financed by the state and another 
third or so find a job. The last third comes knocking on the 
door of the welfare office, a trend which has been rising. At 
the end of 1993, the Ministry of Social Affairs counted around 
800,000 welfare recipients (up 18.1 percent in one year). At 
the current rate, they will number nearly one million by the end 
of the year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Pierre Gerard, monetary policy adviser </F>
to the Bank of France, by Jean-Pierre Robin; place and date not 
given: "Jean-Pierre Gerard: Solutions for the Credit Shortfall"] 
  [Text] Jean-Pierre Gerard is one of six monetary 
policy advisers who is responsible for defining the Bank of 
France's leading interest rates. With his background in 
corporate management, he is worried about the difficulties 
companies are encountering in finding credits to finance the 
economic recovery. He suggests some solutions. 
  [Robin] The members of the Monetary Policy Committee (CPM) 
have, for several weeks now, been stepping up their contacts 
with economic agents, especially outside of the Paris region. 
What are your views on the recovery? 
  [Gerard] The recovery appears to have started, and, as in 
all 
phases of transition, hope tends to alternate with doubt. It 
also appears to me that industrial groups are more aware now of 
exchange rates and the problems they could be faced with in 
Europe caused by sterling, the peseta, and especially the lira, 
since the Italian economy seems very competitive. Bankers, 
however, are more concerned with interest rates and access to 
the capital markets. 
  From the meetings I have had with representatives of 
industry, it is clear that their order books are starting to 
fill up again, although this has yet to be converted into actual 
revenues. Moreover, economic growth is being driven a lot less 
by domestic consumption than by exports. 
  [Robin] How does industry view the so-called "strong franc" 
or policy of monetary stability? 
  [Gerard] First, we should note that all world currencies are 
floating. The only area where there is stability is vis-a-vis 
the mark and the currencies of northern Europe, since they are 
linked by the European Monetary System (EMS). The problem is 
where other currencies are concerned, those that are outside the 
EMS exchange rate mechanism, such as the lira or sterling, not 
to mention the dollar. The fluctuation in the U.S. currency 
plays a key role, and yet the Bank of France and Europe in 
general have no control over it. 
  However, in general French industry appears to be suffering 
more from the weakness of the dollar than Germany's. This is 
especially the case in the high-tech and aeronautics sectors, 
where our companies are more exposed than the Germans to U.S. 
competition. The Germans are more active in sectors like 
mechanical engineering, where they can determine world prices. 
  [Robin] After the successive cuts of recent months, have 
interest rates reached a satisfactory level for companies? 
  [Gerard] What companies are more concerned about today is 
gaining access to credit rather than its actual cost. The banks 
are subjected to the Cooke ratio, which stipulates that their 
credits cannot be more than 12.5 times their capital assets. 
Some of them had to absorb losses last year which reduced their 
assets and thus their ability to award loans. They suffered in 
1993, and are now looking to restore their operating margins by 
choosing their risks more carefully and lending at still 
relatively high rates. 
  [Robin] Should we fear a shortfall of credits for the 
recovery? 
  [Gerard] Companies have particularly large borrowing 
requirements in two circumstances. First, when they lose money 
and are faced with a question of how to survive; and second, in 
periods of recovery and growth. The latter is the current 
situation. Companies have to replenish their stocks when the 
orders begin to come in again so that more revenues can be 
generated, even though the money will only start to trickle in 
in another six months time. Companies therefore have high 
borrowing requirements at a time when banks' offers of loans are 
tending to dry up, for reasons that are not necessarily all 
their own fault. 
  [Robin] What solutions do you propose to get us out of this 
impasse? 
  [Gerard] We should implement a number of solutions, but one 
of the simplest things we could do would certainly be to use the 
"carry back" [previous two words in English] mechanism better 
than we do currently. Let me remind you how it works: 
Companies that go into the red in a given year can deduct this 
loss from the profits made in previous years. This operation 
generates a tax debt which is only called in after five years. 
In reality, the state will only reimburse companies if 
corporate profits for the following five years are less than the 
previous loss. Companies finding themselves in this situation 
would then be in quite a bad position. 
  [Gerard] Thus, banks will not allow companies to refinance 
their loans generated by carry back, which is regrettable. The 
banks would be a lot less reticent, however, if these debts 
could be demanded from the tax authorities after just two years. 
I should also point out that companies using this kind of 
instrument are generally healthy ones, since they must have made 
profits in previous years to be able to apply the carry back 
principle. 
  [Robin] Would that be enough to trigger credit distribution? 
  [Gerard] Of course not. We would also have to consider 
widening the field of guaranty and mutual insurance systems to 
cover risks. Sofaris, which guarantees bank loans under certain 
conditions, is currently playing a very positive role. However, 
the guaranty system would be more efficient and less expensive 
if Sofaris was not the only body of this kind. In any event, we 
must try and match the banks' offer of credit with potential 
company demand. Unfortunately this is not the case at present 
because this has been an extremely difficult year for everyone. 
  [Robin] The policy of the Bank of France aims at lowering 
all 
interest rates as much as possible, including both short- and 
long- term rates. This is a legitimate concern, but does it 
really correspond to the needs of companies which have mainly 
short-term debts? 
  [Gerard] That is a major topic for discussion: How can 
different economic operators all be financed? It seems that the 
state and the housing sector are mainly concerned with long-term 
rates. Large companies use long- and short-term rates in 
roughly the same proportions. Small- and medium-sized 
companies, however, are mainly concerned with short-term 
financing, with credits often index-linked to the short rates. 
Let me add that, in periods of recovery, what companies need 
more than anything else are short-term cash facilities to 
finance their capital requirements. 
  This is the ground that monetary policy covers, but this 
policy is clearly not neutral; like all policies, it has 
redistributing effects. The CPM is looking to reduce rates 
gradually. We have seen eight cuts of 0.1 percent in the 
discount rate since the beginning of the year. Experience has 
shown that each cut had a favorable impact on long-term rates. 
During the bond market crisis that shook all the financial 
markets in the first quarter, France and Germany came out on 
top. The monetary policy that was implemented therefore had a 
beneficial effect for everyone. From my experience in industry, 
I believe gradual change is excellent. There is nothing worse 
for economic activity than sudden shocks, which then require 
very painful adaptation mechanisms. 
  [Robin] Can we expect further interest rate cuts in France? 
  [Gerard] The cuts we have made prove our desire to go along 
with the economic recovery. However, the banking system also 
has to be able and strong enough to pass this on. You cannot 
have ailing banks issuing loans. 
  [Robin] Price stability is the final, or even sole aim of 
our 
monetary policy. At the end of the day, though, is this not a 
secondary concern since inflation is well under control in 
France and has been for several years? 
  [Gerard] The framework of the law, and our Constitution, is 
clear: The Bank of France must guarantee price stability. The 
problem is knowing what we are measuring, and this problem has 
not really been considered. The CPM has set itself the aim of 
preventing retail prices from growing by more than 2 percent a 
year in the medium term. Maybe this gauge is not perfect. It 
is designed to measure just retail prices and excludes 
industrial production prices which can vary quite significantly 
-- on average, these fell, sometimes quite sharply, during the 
recession. How else can we define stability if there are no 
other indices? The retail price index is, perhaps, the best of 
a bad bunch. However, it is still open to criticism. 
  [Robin] Is not the link with the mark, although this is not 
in the Bank of France's remit, more important than domestic 
currency stability which currently guides the bank's action? 
  [Gerard] The Bank of France's responsibility is to maintain 
the domestic stability of the currency -- price stability -- 
which it defines itself. This is what the law dictates. It is 
the government's responsibility to set out the exchange rate 
policy -- all the Bank of France has to do is implement it. 
This policy has been defined, and has as its reference the 
European monetary agreement of 2 August 1993. 
<H5>  A Collegial Institution </H5>
  [Gerard] In practice, it is clear that our aim has been to 
keep interest rates as low as possible in France. However, we 
must of course be careful about how the foreign exchange markets 
will react. 
  We do not have much influence over the dollar rate, but we 
do 
have to take into account the behavior of the franc in the EMS. 
I should add that we are happy with the current franc-mark 
exchange rate because, as it stands, it means that French 
industry has a competitive edge over Germany. 
  [Robin] The CPM is composed of very different types of 
people. What are the discussions like? 
  [Gerard] The CPM will have been very successful when it 
manages to convince people it is a collegial institution. 
Having said that, our discussions can be lively, but our 
decisions are taken collectively. 
  [Robin] After a vote? 
  [Gerard] Everything is possible: a consensus decision, a 
common agreement, a vote, etc. Our meeting closely resembles 
any other board meeting. 
  [Robin] Leaving aside its collegial aspect, how do you view 
the CPM's mission? 
  [Gerard] The CPM has been asked to play the role of a kind 
of 
guardian of monetary morality. You have to understand that the 
currency guarantees trade. All trade is a contract, a promise 
that must be kept in space and time: The law demands monetary 
stability, a guarantee that this promise will be kept, while 
inflation distorts these contracts. 
  Secondly, it is the CPM's duty to listen and explain. Since 
sovereignty of the currency was passed to us, we have to explain 
clearly what we are doing with it. The law states that we are 
responsible for our actions to the president of the republic and 
parliament. The success of the CPM will finally depend on the 
success of the economy -- we can make our contribution, but of 
course it is not all down to us!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A European 14th July"] </F>
  [Text] Germany was not asked to take part in the 
celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the allied 
landings in Normandy (6 June) and Provence (14 August). 
However, German soldiers belonging to the Eurocorps, along with 
French, Luxembourg, Belgian, and soon Spanish troops, will 
parade down the Champs Elysees on 14 July. Meant to end all 
misunderstandings once and for all, Francois Mitterrand's 
invitation has been enthusiastically received by Helmut Kohl. 
  This initiative is reminiscent of another one back in 1984, 
when these two men, holding hands, paid their respects to all 
the victims of World Wars I and II. Elderly Parisians probably 
remember seeing the Wehrmacht, complete with marching band, 
march down the same Champs Elysees in 1940. 
  Over half a century later, after reconciliation was achieved 
by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer, the two countries 
persist in stepping up cooperation in all fields, including 
defense. Should such a symbol be disavowed? Mitterrand and 
Kohl have chosen both to eschew forgetfulness and to advance 
European integration, even though everything is not perfect in 
the Franco-German dialogue. 
  The Eurocorps itself is a symbol that goes beyond the 
relations between the two countries. This 45,000-strong army 
corps, scheduled to become operational in late 1995, will be 
integrated into a broader organization (either NATO or the WEU 
[Western European Union]) with a view to ensuring European 
security. It is a blueprint of a European army which is not yet 
called as such. Accordingly, other partners have been asked to 
participate, among which Luxembourg, Belgium, and Spain, which 
will all contribute troops. 
  In such a context, the Eurocorps is one of the entities on 
which Europe's defense system will be based, as are the 
German-American, German-Dutch, and multinational (under British 
command) corps now being put together. However, the Eurocorps 
is much more than that. It should one day become the hard core 
of a European peacekeeping, or even peacemaking, force, either 
placed under UN command or controlled totally or in part by a 
single European command, depending on the decision arrived at by 
each government involved. 
  The Eurocorps' parade on the Champs Elysees can be seen as 
the first step toward a future European commitment to ensure the 
stability of its own continent. Ten days before the European 
election, the initiative of the president of the Republic may 
also aim to convince those who have been condemning European 
apathy in the Yugoslav crisis that there are reasons for hope.

  [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) urged its 25 member nations 
Tuesday [7 June] to review regulations on wages and working 
hours as a way to create jobs. 
  In a report on employment and unemployment, the Paris-based 
Western think tank also called for improvement of education and 
job training systems to meet a shift in demand away from 
unskilled jobs to more highly skilled jobs. 
  The report came out as the OECD opened a two-day ministerial 
meeting to look into ways to secure employment, with as many as 
35 million people out of work within the group. 
  As for working hours, the report proposes introducing 
flexible working schedules for part-time workers, reducing 
overtime allowances and reviewing the minimum wage to provide 
more job opportunities. 
  But the report is quick to underline the need to carry out 
the changes without reducing social protection levels for 
workers. 
  "High unemployment should be addressed not by seeking to 
slow 
the pace of change, but rather by restoring economies' and 
societies' capacity to adapt it [as received]," the report says. 
  "But this must be undertaken in ways which do not abandon 
the 
social objectives of OECD societies. Rather, social objectives 
must be met in new, more carefully designed ways that do not 
have the past unintended and undesirable side effects." 
  It brushes aside a persistent argument in some industrial 
nations that imports of low-priced goods from developing nations 
is the main cause of unemployment in industrial nations, 
describing such a view as "ill-founded." 
  The report points to data showing that the weight of 
low-wage 
countries' exports in the overall expenditure of OECD countries 
on goods and services is only about 1.5 percent. 
  "The number of markets which they (low-wage countries) 
contest is greater, and their effect on the intensity of 
competition is increasing," it says. 
  "But the judgment on present evidence is that the overall 
impact both of imports from these countries and their 
contestation of OECD markets is too small to account for a 
significant part of either current unemployment or falling 
relative wages of the low-skilled."

  [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- The Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will adopt a joint 
communique Wednesday [8 June] proposing an agenda for the next 
round of world trade talks and urging stronger links with other 
countries, Japanese officials said. 
  The OECD will also sign on an agreement with Russia on 
cooperation to help its transformation to a market economy after 
the annual meeting ends around noon, they said. 
  In the communique, the OECD will call for reinforcing the 
global free trading system and a new role for the Paris-based 
organization in the rapidly changing world, according to the 
officials. 
  As a possible theme for the next round of multilateral 
global 
trade negotiations, which will succeed the Uruguay Round of 
talks concluded in December, the communique will propose linking 
trade and environment, investment, labor and competition 
policies, they said. 
  The proposed new role of the OECD should be built through 
strengthening its links with countries such as South Korea, 
which wants to join the OECD, China and other Asian countries, 
they said. 
  Mexico was admitted in the OECD last month as the first 
newcomer to the 33-year-old organization since 1973, and many 
other countries, mostly in the former Soviet-dominated bloc, are 
reportedly hoping to follow suit. 
  Jobs crisis strategy, agreed by the 25 member states 
Tuesday, 
will also form part of the joint statement, the officials said. 
  The more than 60 detailed job-creation steps in the strategy 
were drawn up after a two-year study. The number of jobless 
people of working age in the 25 countries is heading for a 
record 35 million. 
  In addition, the communique will include an agreement to 
prevent bribery -- especially in developing nations -- by 
companies in the member countries. 
  The United States proposed that corrupt practices be 
included 
because a U.S. law banning international bribery puts its 
enterprises at a disadvantage with firms in other countries that 
have no such legislation. 
  The planned assistance to Russia, to be signed by the OECD 
and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, will focus on aid 
in the legal and statistical fields. 
  The aid package will be reviewed every year in annual 
cooperation programs that the two sides will map out jointly. 
  The signing will be followed by a meeting of OECD and 
Russian 
ministers to exchange views on the organization's support for 
the ongoing conversion in Russia of military industries to 
commercial ones. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, who represented Japan at the OECD sessions, 
is scheduled to separately meet Kozyrev on Wednesday morning, 
the officials said. 
  The bilateral talks, the first in two and a half months 
since 
then Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata met the Russian foreign 
minister, will include discussion of how to deal with the North 
Korean nuclear issue, they said.

  [Text] Paris, June 8 KYODO -- The Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) wound up its annual 
ministerial meeting Wednesday [8 June] after adopting a joint 
communique on solving various global issues ranging from the 
world job crisis to an agenda under a new world trade body. 
  After two days of intensive discussions, foreign and trade 
ministers from 25 of the world's richest nations released the 
communique which proposed reinforcing the OECD's links with 
nonmember countries, especially China and other Asian nations. 
  The communique recommended four major issues be addressed 
under the next round of global trade talks sponsored by the 
World Trade Organization (WTO), successor to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The recommended topics are the linkage between trade and 
environment, relations between trade and labor standards, trade 
and investment, and competition policy under global trade. 
  The communique's proposals will form a basis for an economic 
declaration to be issued at the Naples summit of the Group of 
Seven key industrial countries next month.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Claude Paye, secretary general of the </F>
OECD, by Pascal Aubert; place and date not given: "Jean-Claude 
Paye: `Europe Must Revise Its Social Protection Systems'"] 
  [Text] [Aubert] This time the world recovery seems to be 
well and truly underway. In the wake of the recovery in the 
Anglo-Saxon countries, economic activity is now reviving in 
Europe. Does the OECD agree? 
  [Paye] Yes. All the reports by economic institutes, national 
organizations, and governments agree that, in addition to the 
Anglo-Saxon countries which have been recovering for some time 
now, there are definite signs of a recovery in continental 
Europe and Japan. Spring is not completely with us yet, but 
winter is almost over. This will lead us to upwardly revise, 
slightly, the forecasts we made five months ago in "Perspectives 
Economique" [economic prospects] published at the end of 
December 1993. The rise varies depending on the countries 
involved, but on average, for 1994 and 1995, figures will be 0.2 
to 0.5 percent up. 
  [Aubert] What about in the specific case of France? 
  [Paye] At the time of speaking I do not have any fresh data 
so I cannot give you a precise answer. I just know that there 
are indeed clear signs of a recovery in France and, in all 
probability, France will be one of the countries for which we 
will be upwardly revising our predictions. 
  [Aubert] There is still a shadow cast over the generally 
improving world picture, namely the problem of unemployment. 
Your organization was charged with making an in-depth analysis 
of the causes of unemployment and to come up with some possible 
solutions. Can you give us some idea of the solutions the OECD 
should be unveiling in a few days time? 
  [Paye] To get an idea of the solutions, you first need some 
understanding of the problems. 
  Therefore we looked into all the possible causes as far as 
we 
could. We concluded that the fundamental cause of the situation 
our countries are in is that they have insufficiently adapted to 
the changes in the operation of the economy brought about by the 
process of globalization, i.e. the interaction between 
competition and technological progress. In today's global 
economy, competition has become very fierce. As a result, all 
countries, and ours in particular -- since we are the ones who 
have been caught up -- have to try and improve their efficiency, 
step up creativity, become more innovative, explore new avenues, 
and remain at the leading edge of economic, scientific, and 
technological development. If you look at what has happened in 
the last 20 years, it is clear that the OECD countries' capacity 
or will to adapt has not increased in proportion to what was 
required by changes on the world stage. A gap quickly opened up 
between what we should have done and what we have actually done 
to prepare for the future. 
  [Aubert] What kind of proposals does this diagnosis give 
rise 
to? 
  [Paye] To date, our economies have been leading the race. 
If they are to remain ahead of the field, they must increase 
their innovative and creative capacities. This is a 
precondition if we are to have a better standard of living and 
if we are to take a full share in the markets that are being 
created and are developing at high speed in the rest of the 
world. For this, we have to be competitive. The policies we 
should implement must strive to create the most favorable 
conditions for company competitiveness. 
  This first means that the macroeconomic policies have to 
remain stable in the medium term, reassuring economic operators 
and, when necessary and possible, making full use of the room 
for maneuver that may exist on the monetary or budgetary levels. 
However, we should be under no illusions: Currently the OECD 
countries have very little room for maneuver. Especially on the 
budgetary level, you will not reassure economic operators by 
widening the budget deficit or increasing the public debt. 
Instead, it is necessary to continue getting public finances in 
order and trying to stabilize and then reduce the burden of 
debt, which has reached considerable proportions in some 
countries. 
  Then, above all, you need rigorous structural policies that 
help improve the economy's capacities for innovation and 
creation. In particular, that means establishing the right 
conditions for the creation of economic activity and the 
creation of companies. Given the new methods for the production 
of goods and services, the reduction in the size of companies, 
the use of networks, and the growing share of services in 
manufacturing, we are in a kind of economy where activity and 
employment are increasingly being created by small work units. 
How can we favor the creation of activities and companies? 
There are many things we can do to contribute to this process, 
and I will mention only a few: By reducing uncertainty and the 
weight of administrative tasks, adapting our tax structures, and 
adopting new standards for information that are similar and as 
far-reaching as those that exist in the rest of the world, since 
information has become the lifeblood of the globalized economy 
and is the main product that companies now need. 
  Creating the right conditions for the creation of companies 
is all very well, but this alone is not enough. We must also 
make it easier to actually employ people, and in any event, we 
must not discourage companies from taking on new employees. We 
all know that certain aspects of labor legislation are sometimes 
counterproductive in terms of employment. In France, for 
example, the SMIC [minimum wage] as it currently stands, seems 
to discourage the recruitment of unqualified and young workers. 
  In addition, we have to modernize our education and training 
systems. This is now evident, at a time when economic growth is 
increasingly based on knowledge, and knowledge that must evolve 
quickly. We do have to teach people a trade, but we also have 
to teach them how to change professions and learn new skills. 
We need education and training systems that cover the whole of 
active life. 
  Lastly, we should not forget that a competitive world also 
requires flexibility and mobility, including a certain degree of 
wage flexibility. This is a fact that is gradually dawning on 
people. Even if no one says so publicly, this policy is 
increasingly being practiced. In fact, all countries are 
realizing that nothing is more dangerous in the medium to long 
term than a section of the population being left out of the 
labor market and feeling marginalized and abandoned. It is much 
better to have people on albeit low wages than to have people 
unemployed. However, this realization, which shocks many 
people, will have essential consequences. Firstly, it must not 
be possible for someone to be indefinitely locked into a poorly 
remunerated job. If you start on a low salary when you are 
young and unqualified, you must then have access to additional 
education and training. Secondly, we need labor markets that 
operate effectively and in which we can see the opportunities 
that are being presented. Thirdly, geographic and professional 
mobility must be favored by all possible means. 
  Lastly -- and this is part of the indispensable social 
cohesion -- we must make up from other sources those salaries 
for poorly qualified workers that are considered to be too low. 
This poses redistribution problems that we cannot simply sweep 
under the carpet. 
  [Aubert] In the debates on labor market flexibility, there 
is a feeling that the Anglo-Saxon world often serves as the 
reference. However, the American economy, seen from Europe, 
does not look like a very good model where redistribution of 
income is concerned.... 
  [Paye] You will see when you read our report that it is much 
more balanced than that. At the recent Detroit conference, the 
U.S. ministers said that they were not wholly satisfied with 
their system. It is very flexible, very adaptive, and very 
individualistic, enabling many jobs to be created in times of 
recovery. However, in the last 20 years, the lower half of the 
wage scale has lost out in terms of purchasing power. Some 30 
million Americans now live below the poverty line. In our 
report, we say that in Europe, and in some ways in Japan too, 
there is a rigidity in the structures that is born out of the 
culture and social victories that have their worth as well as 
their disadvantages. This rigidity prevents the European 
economies from adapting to the challenges of the world today and 
tomorrow. That does not mean that everything has to be 
scrapped, though. We have to try and see how, by reducing the 
counterproductive aspects that our production systems have, we 
can concentrate their beneficial effects on those people who 
most need help, those who have to adapt or those who are unable 
to adapt but whom we cannot leave behind. This report in no way 
recommends scrapping the fruit of a century of social progress 
in Europe to adopt the American model in its current form. 
  [Aubert] Where funding the reduction in company labor costs 
is concerned, is there a painless solution? 
  [Paye] The additional wage costs borne by companies often 
discourage them from taking on new employees, especially less 
qualified workers or less experienced workers, such as young 
people. If we take the path of reducing these costs to encourage 
recruitment, we must make up for this reduction since we cannot 
arfford to further worsen social security and budget deficits. 
This implies reexamining all these systems to see if it is 
possible to make savings, in particular by reducing the extent 
to which the system is abused. Moreover, this means that, as 
far as is necessary, we have to find other fiscal resources. 
This is a vast area. 
  [Aubert] The European Commission, for example, suggests 
levying a tax on the amount of energy consumed.... 
  [Paye] That is one of the many possibilities we could 
envisage. We do not propose specifically doing one thing or 
another, because that would require further specific and 
in-depth studies. The measures that would compensate for the 
reduction in additional labor costs are liable to reduce 
consumption or investment. We would therefore have to evaluate 
their net effect on employment. 
  We have drawn up a report and now the quite general 
recommendations we make in it must be tailored to suit each 
member state, taking into account all the differences in their 
situation, legislation, customs, and culture. Moreover, the 
OECD should be used in its capacity as a mutual monitoring body, 
to actively encourage the application of the policy guidelines 
that we have decided on. In many cases, the reforms that are 
needed will be hard to implement. It is helpful if countries 
are not alone in trying to buckle down to the task and in 
proving that in such and such a country, such and such a reform 
has been implemented and is yielding good results. 
  [Aubert] Let us now return to the macroeconomic level of the 
employment crisis. In Europe, governments have reacted in 
sometimes quite different ways. On the one hand there is the 
British attitude which consisted of a surgical operation with 
the devaluation of the pound and accelerated cuts in interest 
rates with the subsequent positive results that that had, and on 
the other hand there is France which has resolutely defended its 
currency to the detriment of everything else. What is the 
correct choice? 
  [Paye] If only there were a "correct choice!" It is very 
difficult to answer this question. Anyway, it has lost much of 
its relevance. You could understand this intellectual debate 
three years ago, when we could see the extent of the crisis 
German reunification was going to trigger. Now, however, with 
quite similar short term interest rates and long rates that are 
lower in Germany and France than in the United Kingdom or 
Italy.... 
  [Aubert] Except that the choice made by France was 
accompanied by a worsening of the economic situation and rising 
unemployment.... 
  [Paye] Of course, the choice had its consequences. However, 
I think it is rather late to be discussing the issue now that it 
holds much less significance. Above all, we must understand how 
the issue looked two or three years ago to the European 
countries that were in the exchange rate system. Should they 
run the risk of a late economic recovery, increased 
unemployment, and thus possible social or even political tension 
to steer a course toward a credibility that would maintain the 
relatively low long-term interest rates, and continue with the 
construction of European economic and monetary union? Those 
European countries that ran this risk have long-term interest 
rates that, until a few weeks ago, were the lowest on record. 
These long-term interest rates are important for investment and 
for the long term plans of individuals. As for this second aim, 
it did not have immediate economic repercussions, but the fact 
of safeguarding the perspective of the creation of an integrated 
European monetary area gave companies and institutions renewed 
confidence. It was therefore a choice between something easier 
and more gratifying in the short term, and something that was 
more difficult but which guaranteed the future. France and 
Germany chose to take the rocky path. It is true that these 
countries have high unemployment, but their credibility is 
intact, long-term and even short-term interest rates are 
relatively low, and companies are well on the way to adapting to 
the new situation -- all things that bode well for future 
growth, employment, and competitiveness. 
  [Aubert] The world has changed a lot in recent years. Does 
the recent admission of Mexico mean, as one diplomat has 
suggested, that the OECD is starting to change its spots? 
  [Paye] I do not think it is changing its spots. The OECD is 
an organization that is completely unique. Its aim is to make 
the world's leading economic countries reflect jointly to define 
their policies together. The OECD countries today account for 
75 percent of total world trade. There can be no doubt that the 
OECD has always been and remains the group of the most advanced 
countries from the point of view of social and economic 
development. 
  [Aubert] To date, in any case, your organization has been 
perceived rightly or wrongly as a kind of "club of rich 
countries...." 
  There are many countries that are not in the OECD whose per 
capita income level is higher than that of Portugal or Greece or 
Turkey. It is just a journalistic simplification to call the 
OECD the "club of rich countries." The OECD is an area for 
working together, a workshop, and an intellectual laboratory for 
the leaders of our countries. So that the OECD retains this 
nature and this usefulness, it has to continue to unite the 
countries that count in the world. The number of these 
countries is growing. As a result, the OECD has to make 
contacts and open up to a greater extent to bring in more and 
more economies as members or observers or partners. To 
dialogue, as we have been doing for five years with Korea, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, and to 
have brought Chile, Argentina and Brazil into this dialogue, 
plus Mexico which joined our organization a few days ago, is a 
way of recognizing that we must bring economies that are not 
currently members of the OECD into the reflection process. Then 
there are the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, with which we 
have been cooperating since the start of the freeze in 
relations, several of which have recently asked to join the 
OECD; and other countries, such as China.... 
  [Paye] You talked of the laboratory-style role of your 
organization. It would appear that certain of your member 
countries want the OECD to become something other than a 
laboratory, for it to play a more visible role on the world 
scene, which would therefore imply that this role is scarcely 
compatible with you remaining at the head of the organization.... 
  [Aubert] We should start by examining the function of our 
organization. I have just described this to you: Ensuring that 
the people who define and implement policies in our member 
countries, i.e., senior civil servants and maybe ministers, 
actually work together. The issue of visibility can be couched 
in the following terms: At what time and on what subject should 
we become "visible" to better serve the organization, i.e., to 
increase its usefulness for the governments? In some cases, it 
is good to be very visible, to help public opinion better 
understand the problem and the solutions it requires. Where 
unemployment is concerned, I think our organization is very 
visible. However, the question is whether we should 
systematically place everything the OECD discusses on the public 
stage and run the risk in some cases of appearing to take sides, 
thus making it harder to arrive at a consensus on the policies 
to be implemented. With premature publicity you always run the 
risk of hardening positions and making it more difficult to 
bring people closer together. Thus, publicity and visibility 
are important, but you have to be discerning. Having said that, 
the member states might think differently from me and 
differently from each other. To give the impression that the 
OECD is invisible and would do better to permanently remain in 
the public eye, is, I think, only creating a false problem. 
  [Paye] Is the replacement of the general secretary also a 
false problem? 
  [Aubert] No, it is a real problem. I am pleased that there 
are so many candidates for the post. That proves it is an 
interesting job and that the organization has a future. It is 
up to the member countries to choose the person they think is 
the most capable of doing the job in the way they want it to be 
done. If they believe it is better, out of principle, to have 
someone with a political past, it is up to them to decide. For 
my part, I do not think this is a necessary requirement for the 
job. I think the qualifications needed are as follows: knowing 
the issues the organization deals with; heeding the very diverse 
nature of the member countries; and being capable of encouraging 
a consensus, because the organization cannot work without one. 
The only power it has is the power it acquires through the 
quality, objectivity, and independence of its secretariat which 
directly determines the intimacy and efficiency of the 
cooperation between the member countries.
