  [Text] Federal Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt has 
called on Iran to continue promptly settling the claims of 
German creditors. It will only make sense to consider holding 
another meeting of the German-Iranian Economic Commission once 
the debt rescheduling agreement that was concluded in February 
has been fulfilled, Rexrodt said at a meeting with Foreign 
Minister Velayati in Bonn. 
  According to official information, Rexrodt and Velayati 
agree 
that both sides are interested in the further development of 
economic relations.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe drew the lessons 
learned from the European elections in the National Assembly 
this afternoon. Juppe observed that the debate over Europe was 
far from over. However, he is still working hard for the opening 
up of European Union [EU] membership to East European countries 
with the exception of Russia: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] This expansion of the EU seems to me 
necessary. It is necessary because we have promised it. For 
more than 40 years we have been telling these countries: When 
you have thrown the yoke of communism, once the Berlin Wall and 
the Iron Curtain have fallen we will welcome you into the 
European family that is yours. It would seem to me absurd and 
dangerous if we do not keep this promise. I would add this 
argument, which may be contested, but which I believe to be very 
strong: If we reject such a development the Franco-German 
partnership would not withstand it. What would the EU be if 
Germany took a different direction? This does not mean that we 
should follow anyone blindly, but it is about whether we 
continue to maintain Franco-German relationa as one of the 
cornerstones of the European construction. If the answer is 
yes, then we should -- for so many reasons and particularly for 
this one -- continue moving toward an expanded Europe. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Berlusconi Gets 3 Million Preference </F>
Votes"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Elected and rejected. Guess who is going 
to Strasbourg? The man with the most votes, Silvio Berlusconi, 
is not going there, despite almost three million personal 
preference votes in the five electoral districts in which he 
headed the list. As prime minister, Berlusconi cannot be elected 
to the European Parliament, but the plebiscite is nonetheless 
impressive. To give an idea, the second person is Gianfranco 
Fini, with two million preference votes (but the National 
Alliance leader received most of his votes in the South); while 
in third place we find PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
Secretary Achille Occhetto, for whom obviously 1,100,000 
personal votes obtained in three--not five--voting districts, 
were not enough to avoid his resignation yesterday. 
  Cut down in size but elected were all the other leaders, 
from 
Umberto Bossi [Northern League] to Mario Segni [Pact for Italy], 
from Marco Pannella [Radical] to Carlo Ripa di Meana [Greens], 
from Fausto Bertinotti [Communist Renewal] to Pierferdinando 
Casini, coordinator of the Christian Democratic Center, who, 
campaigning in the south under the Forza Italia banner, came 
immediately after Berlusconi with another 200,000 votes. Even 
more notable was the feat of Leoluca Orlando who had the 
satisfaction -- unique in Italy -- of beating Berlusconi in 
Palermo, the city of which the Rete leader is mayor. 
  Remaining with the mayors, the following have become members 
of the European Parliament: Marco Formentini of Milan (Northern 
League); Salvatore Tatarella of Cerignola (National Alliance); 
the brother of Deputy Prime Minister Giuseppe; and Giancarlo 
Cito of Taranto, the owner of the local TV6 television station, 
elected at the head of his own list, the Southern Action League. 
Also elected was Bologna's mayor Renzo Imbeni (PDS). [passage

  [Text] The government has won a vote of confidence from the 
Eduskunta on its policy aimed at obtaining membership in the 
European Union [EU]. The Eduskunta rejected the proposal by the 
Leftist Alliance of a vote of no confidence by 97 votes to 80. 
Sixteen representatives of the government parties abstained: 
nine from the Center Party, six from the Christian League, and 
one from the Swedish People's Party. The National Coalition 
Party unanimously supported the government. No representative of 
the government parties voted against the government. Of the 
opposition parties, one representative of the Greens and the 
sole representative of the Liberal Party supported the 
government. 
  Prime Minister Esko Aho interpreted the vote as meaning that 
there are no obstacles for the government to pursue its EU line. 
However, each government party must define its own stance on the 
matter. According to Aho, it was good that the results of the 
vote of confidence were clear. What was not so good was that 
the support from the government parties was not unanimous. 
  According to Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the 
Eduskunta's decision will calm the financial markets.

    [Editorial Report] According to a Finnish News Service 
report carried on page 7 of leading national daily Helsinki 
HELSINGIN SANOMAT on 23 May, the organization representing 
agricultural interests has decided not to support European Union 
[EU] membership in the referendum to be held on 16 October. Esa 
Harmala, chairman of the Farmers and Forest Owners' Federation 
(MTK), announced this decision of the governing board in an 
interview, asserting that the group would not "campaign for 
membership under any circumstances." Depending on the outcome of 
the ongoing argument over farm subsidies, however, the 
organization in the future might adopt "a completely negative 
position" or maintain this slightly more ambiguous stance of not 
recommending how its constituency should vote. Harmala, who 
prior to being elected to head the MTK in April, was chief 
negotiator for farm issues at the Brussels talks on Finnish 
entry terms. In the interview cited, Harmala accused the 
government of having broken many of its promises made to farmers 
about these same terms, especially relating to subsidy issues. 
  In contrast, Finland's largest labor union, the blue-collar 
Finnish Confederation of Labor (SAK), decided to back EU 
membership, as discussed by HELSINGIN SANOMAT reporter Jarmo 
Aaltonen in a story on 29 May. SAK delegates voted 79 to 19, 
with eight abstentions. In a second ballot demanded by an EU 
opponent in which the proposition was given more negative 
wording, the stand was confirmed by a 73-13 vote. Opposition was 
mainly concentrated in the Left Alliance Party (VL) with 
scattered support from Social Democratic ranks. Notable among 
opponents were leaders of some constituent unions, including the 
Merchant Seamen's Union (a Social Democrat) and the Electrical 
Workers' Union (a Left Alliance member). Opponents charged that 
membership would result in reducing the level of social 
services, destroying worker security, cutting wages, weakening 
the position of women in society, and ending Finnish 
sovereignty. One VL delegate repeated the familiar assertion 
that democracy would suffer when matters are settled in 
Brussels. 
  The government's decision of 26 May to continue high farm 
subsidies through a "domestic support package" over a five-year 
transition to the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy] was seen by 
Aaltonen as having cost some loss of support for membership. The 
SAK also adopted a "separate stand" on the agricultural package, 
asserting that this would lead to: "an insupportable excess 
production, and is an attempt by producers to preserve their 
special privileges until the year 2000." 
  In the end, the SAK leadership carried the day in a 
promembership resolution by asserting that the organization two 
years ago had voted to join the EU pending a favorable outcome 
in the entry talks, and that this had now been achieved. 
  In a Finish News Service report of 2 June on page 6, NTK 
chief Harmala stated that the government's agriculture package 
did not go far enough to justify a change of mind regarding the 
body's attitude on membership. He now said the MTK would not 
adopt a final position on the referendum until it received 
assurance about the level of the the national subsidy package, 
and that the EU Commission would approve it. Unless such 
assurance is received in good time, he said, "...farmers and the 
MTK will be forced into actively opposing membership. He 
attacked the EU for rejecting Finland's demand in Brussels for 
step-by-step adjustment to community food-price levels, and 
doubted it would accept this arrangement now."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis concluded the 
first round of his talks in New York and today will go to 
Washington for talks with U.S. Government and Senate officials. 
Mikhailidhis will meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott; U.S. presidential adviser George Stephanopoulos; 
Claiborne Pell, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee; and Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
  In New York the foreign minister had meetings with the 
representatives of all the UN Security Council members except 
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who was not in New York. He 
also had a working luncheon with UN official Marrack Goulding. 
  In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent in New York, Mikhailidhis said he was satisfied 
with his talks, adding that the Security Council members see the 
need for a new opening. He mentioned that he is starting to be 
optimistic that continuous involvement by the Security Council, 
either the entire council or just the permanent members, in 
efforts to find ways to change the basic problem--the lack of 
goodwill by the Turkish side--is an idea that is becoming more 
acceptable. 
  Referring to the talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's deputy special representative in Cyprus, and 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, Mikhailidhis said it is 
important whether Denktas has accepted the 21 March UN document 
in its entirety, not if he has accepted one or the other 
provision. 
  In his statement, the foreign minister said that all 
indications show that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
communication with the Security Council about the talks between 
Denktas and Feissel will be based on the report that Feissel 
will submit to him. Mikhailidhis said this report is expected in 
New York soon.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that if Greece 
unilaterally extends its territorial waters to 12 miles, this 
will lead to very great difficulties and conflicts. Demirel 
said: Faits accomplis always have very bad consequences. We 
hope that our neighbor Greece will refrain from making faits 
accomplis that will lead to situations with which it will not be 
able to cope. 
  The president observed the Sea Wolf-I 94 exercises and 
attended a briefing session at the Fatih frigate. Fleet 
Commander Admiral Guven Erkaya discussed the details of the 
exercise. 
  Replying to reporters' questions, President Demirel pointed 
out that if Greece extends its territorial waters to 12 miles, 
Turkey will not have access to the sea. He stressed that Greece 
should not disturb Turkey by means of certain faits accomplis. 
He pointed out that historical problems exist between Turkey 
and Greece, caused by the fact that they are neighbors. He 
added: One of them concerns the territorial waters, another one 
is the continental shelf, yet another one is the FIR [Flight 
Information Region] line. There are other similar problems. 
For the past 20 to 25 years, the two sides argue about these 
problems. Sometimes these arguments are harsh. I believe that 
if anything is to be resolved, or if one of the sides has 
anything to say, it should be done in peaceful ways. However, 
if Greece unilaterally extends its territorial waters to 12 
miles, this would lead to very great difficulties, to conflicts. 
It would lead to very great conflicts. 
  President Demirel stressed that faits accomplis always have 
very bad consequences. He added: We hope Greece will refrain 
from faits accomplis that will lead to unmanageable situations. 
This might be interpreted as a threat to Greece. It is not. 
The point is that Turkey is determined to resolve our conflicts 
with Greece in peaceful ways. I hope Greece will not force fait 
accomplis on Turkey in areas where Turkey is extremely 
sensitive, such as the territorial waters issue. The 
consequences would be bad. 
  Asked what the Russian reaction will be to the new sea 
traffic arrangements in the straits that start on 1 July, the 
president replied: I believe that Russia will understand what 
we want. 
  Demirel pointed out that Turkey is not violating the rights 
granted by the Montreux Convention. He stressed that great 
damage is being caused to Turkey because the ships sail through 
the straits in a disorganized way. He said: Had the accident 
which occurred in Bosporus a while ago taken place deeper inside 
the strait, Turkey would have incurred great losses. 
Inconceivable losses. No one has the right to cause such loss 
to Turkey. What Turkey is introducing now is discipline. I 
hope the Russian Federation will understand that. 
  In a speech during the briefing session, the president 
pointed out that every unit of the Turkish Armed Forces has high 
discipline and a high level of training. Turkey is not hostile 
to anyone, he said, and the Turkish foreign policy is not a 
hostile one.

  [Text] Luxembourg, June 14 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
has raised ECU300 million (about 345 million dollars) from EU 
banks for a ECU2 billion fund to boost investments, the European 
Investment Bank (EIB) said here Tuesday [14 June]. 
  EIB Chairman Sir Brian Unwin said the so-called European 
Investment Fund would generate guaranteed loans of ECU6 billion 
(about 6.9 billion dollars) immediately and nearly three times 
that much later on. 
  The money will be targeted on long-term pan-European rail, 
road and tunnel networks aimed at boosting economic growth and 
European competitiveness. 
  The EU has already identified 11 such projects on which it 
wants an initial ECU32 billion (about 37 billion dollars) 
invested by the turn of the century. 
  The EIF fund will also be used to fund subsidised loans to 
small- and medium-sized businesses. Unwin said the fund 
comprised ECU2 billion of subscription capital. 
  Of this, ECU1.4 billion comes from the EU budget and the EIB 
itself, ECU300 million from EU governments, and ECU300 million 
from 58 financial institutions -- some of them private -- in all 
12 EU countries. 
  "It's about getting sensible capital into worthwhile 
projects," he told a press conference. 
  The European Commission has scaled down ambitious plan to 
finance transport, telecommunications and energy projects 
networks originally estimated at ECU120 billion (about 138 
billion dollars) over 12 years. 
  Now the Commission is struggling to keep the skeleton of the 
programme intact in the face of unwillingness among many EU 
countries to spend public money on ambitious projects at a time 
of economic recovery. 
  The debate will feature high on the agenda of an EU summit 
next week on the Greek island of Corfu.

<F P=106> [Marc Paoloni report: "Alain Lamassoure Wants a Reform of </F>
the EU Commission"] 
  [Excerpt] At the European Union (EU) General Affairs 
Council meeting in Luxembourg, French European Affairs Minister 
Alain Lamassoure yesterday expressed the view that the 
Commission's existing status has "had its day," that it is "no 
longer tolerated by public opinion," and that it ought to be 
reformed with a view to "greater answerability." This statement 
comes 10 days before the European summit in Corfu, where the 
process of the EU's institutional reform will be launched, 
culminating in the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. 
According to Alain Lamassoure, this will require a new 
referendum. The Corfu summit, Alain Juppe stated for his part, 
ought to launch the preparatory work for this institutional 
meeting. The Council of Ministers, the Commission, and 
Parliament will be asked to draw up an assessment of the 
implementation over a little more than one year of the Treaty on 
European Union. These reports will serve as the raw material 
for a "think tank" which will be created in mid-1995 to prepare 
for the Intergovernmental Conference the following year. 
<H5>  No Details on Future Projects </H5>
  Yesterday, Alain Lamassoure seemed sensitive to the problem 
of "guiding" the European programs on large networks, which, in 
his opinion, rank as the "third biggest common policy exercise," 
alongside agricultural policy and structural policy. It is a 
program to which the Twelve will solemnly reaffirm their 
attachment at the Corfu summit on 24 and 25 June. However, they 
will limit themselves to approving the 11 priority projects for 
the construction of major transport infrastructures and the 
eight energy projects, the list of which was confirmed in 
Luxembourg yesterday by their foreign ministers. 
  Alain Juppe, apparently anxious to correct the impression 
given by the relative modesty of these initial investments, 
stressed the "determination" of the Twelve to implement the 
whole of the program envisaged. The same tone was taken by his 
European affairs colleague: "The Brussels decision to spend 
ECU20 billion per year has not been called into question," Alain 
Lamassoure said. The fact remains that no details have been 
given on the additional projects which might be implemented to 
move from an overall investment of less than ECU32 billion to 
the ECU200 billion mentioned at the Brussels summit six months 
ago. However, with regard to a program aimed at speeding up and 
consolidating economic growth, nobody can deny that the overall 
effect is not the same in the two cases. [passage omitted]

Brittan by Paolo Peluffo in Brussels; date not given: "This Is 
How I, a Conservative, Will Change Europe"] 
  [Text] [Peluffo] Sir Leon, you are officially in the 
running to head post-Delors Europe, a Europe that chose a 
center-right majority on Sunday [12 June]. Will it be a Europe 
in which market freedom or solidarity prevails? 
  [Brittan] It is wrong to set the values of the free market 
and solidarity against one another. In today's Europe, these 
two elements exist side be side. What is changing is the 
balance between them. In the seventies, the pendulum swung 
toward the idea that the individual had to be protected under 
any circumstances. We have now seen that excessive protection 
inhibits employers and discourages them from taking on new 
employees. So now the pendulum is swinging back, in Italy as 
well, and the idea of giving employers a free hand is taking 
over. Nevertheless, in spite of these oscillations, I do not 
believe that the solidarity element is going by the board, 
because unemployment is the only really major problem facing the 
European Union today. 
  [Peluffo] Is the Delors plan for boosting employment still 
credible? 
  [Brittan] The plan set out in the white paper is still 
feasible, and I hope that the Corfu European Council will adopt 
it in a few days' time. 
  [Peluffo] Do you not fear that the railroad networks and 
infrastructure works envisaged in the Delors plan will 
distinctly neglect the north-south axis in favor of its 
East-West counterpart? 
  [Brittan] Yes, this is an important point. The Commission's 
intention is certainly to develop an infrastructural grid that 
will be as fair as possible. And it is no mere coincidence that 
Christophersen [European commissioner responsible for economic 
affairs] has selected Milan airport as one of the priority 
projects. It is also true that the reintegration of East Europe 
is the greatest task facing the Union, but this must not come 
about at the expense of a strong, well thought-out policy on the 
Mediterranean area. 
  [Peluffo] The Maastricht Treaty is looking like its own 
ghost. Everyone is waiting for the revision conference scheduled 
for 1996. To do what? 
  [Brittan] The priority goal of the 1996 meeting must be to 
reform the European institutions to make them efficient and 
competitive even after expansion to 16 or 20 countries. The 
problem with the Maastricht Treaty is obvious. There were two 
parallel proposals. One was Monetary Union, which had a clear 
political objective and has worked well. The other, Political 
Union, had no specific objective and has produced less coherent 
results. 
  [Peluffo] In its first actual instance of application, the 
Bosnian tragedy, the Political Union has made a poor showing.... 
  [Brittan] I do not agree. The Bosnian issue is an ongoing 
tragedy that neither Europe nor the United Nations has proved 
capable of settling. But the Union has not been idle. We have 
effectively applied the economic and customs sanctions for which 
we received the UN mandate. We have exerted the maximum 
possible pressure on the warring parties, and the factions have 
been brought to the negotiating table. 
  [Peluffo] But people are still dying.... 
  [Brittan] The Union has never had the means required for 
military intervention. We have no magic formulae, but our 
experience -- of which Italian experience forms an essential 
part -- regarding that part of the world leads me to hope that 
we can make a real contribution to peace. 
  [Peluffo] Sir Leon, you were a respected minister in the 
government led by Mrs. Thatcher, the sworn enemy of European 
Monetary Union. Do you believe in the single currency? 
  [Brittan] I am certain that there will be a single currency. 
The timing may be in some doubt, but the single currency will 
come, I have no doubt about that. 
  [Peluffo] How can you be so sure? 
  [Brittan] The single currency is the necessary complement to 
a single market, it is the other side of the same coin. 
Moreover, if we have the single currency, European industry 
will gain from several points of view: It will lower the cost 
of transactions within the Union, we would have a world-class 
currency to work with, with all the benefits in terms of 
strength and power that this entails, small- and medium-sized 
businesses would be encouraged to trade across common frontiers, 
and so on. 
  [Peluffo] But there are the famous "convergence criteria" 
poised to pounce on all the member states. There is a risk that 
no one will be able to comply with them.... 
  [Brittan] The convergence conditions are important, if only 
because they force governments to adopt sound economic policies. 
Then the European Central Bank has a specific mandate that 
imposes monetary policies designed to lower inflation and keep 
it low. Of course, we still have a long way to go in this 
direction. 
  [Peluffo] Do you think Italy will make it? 
  [Brittan] We have to help Italy meet the convergence 
criteria 
and join the Monetary Union from the outset, as befits one of 
the founder members of the EEC. 
  [Peluffo] Do you have no fears of Europe becoming dominated 
by Germany? 
  [Brittan] The histories, traditions, and cultures of the 
individual European countries protect us against any type of 
hegemony, whether it be the economic hegemony of Germany, or 
cultural hegemony of the type that some see in the predominance 
of the English language. But enlargement to 20 states will put 
the German population, which is by far the largest, at one-fifth 
of the total. All things considered, it is not such a terribly 
alarming prospect. 
  [Peluffo] In Cernobbio two years ago, you made a heartfelt 
appeal to Italy to reduce subsidies to industry and to balance 
its accounts. How do you see the situation two years later? 
  [Brittan] You have made enormous progress since then. My 
address in Cernobbio followed that of Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, then 
governor of the Bank of Italy, and I echoed his appeal for 
sounder economic policies, for a reduction in the weight of the 
public sector. Since then, the reforms over which he presided 
as prime minister have begun to bear fruit. Inflation and 
interest rates have fallen in a really impressive manner. The 
cost of the public debt has been lowered. The first 
privatizations have got off to a good start. 
  [Peluffo] Are you optimistic about Italy? 
  [Brittan] Italy has turned a decisive corner. The change has 
also been psychological. This will enhance its real force. I 
believe that the feather bed that the state provided for a lot 
of major corporations will soon prove not merely useless, but 
damaging. The subterranean force of the Italian economy and the 
creativity of your entrepreneurs are truly outstanding. 
  [Peluffo] What is your assessment of the first steps that 
the 
Berlusconi government has taken in this field? 
  [Brittan] Removing the crushing weight of taxation (which 
was 
needed to sustain a debt-ridden public sector) will allow the 
live wires in the Italian economy to prove their worth. 
  [Peluffo] For years you were commissioner for competition, 
the European antitrust board. Does it not strike you that 
Italian capitalism is too concentrated? 
  [Brittan] Wherever there is a stock market dominated by just 
a few operators, it is more difficult to have stability. 
Whenever too few people are watching each other's moves, it is 
more likely that they will become inward-looking. In Britain 
this problem has been solved by privatization, which has 
increased the numbers of shareholders. 
  [Peluffo] [French] President Mitterrand has expressed 
concern 
over the concentration of television channel ownership and 
political power that has occurred in Italy. What is your view? 
  [Brittan] Television is certainly a powerful weapon, but it 
has always been recognized as such. For example, when General 
de Gaulle set about organizing how the broadcasting media were 
to operate in France, he took enormous care to keep television 
and radio under state control, because he felt that the 
newspapers were against the government and that this would 
guarantee a certain equilibrium. In the early years, television 
in all the European countries was controlled by the political 
authority. Then commercial television developed. Generally 
speaking, I think that this has been a beneficial process. 
  [Peluffo] As industry minister in the first Thatcher 
government, what do you think of our privatizations? 
  [Brittan] You still have the most important ones to go. The 
privatization of the telecommunications sector will constitute 
an extremely significant step.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Free-Trade </F>
Agreement With Lithuania Should Be Initialled Before End of 
Month"] 
  [Text] The third round of negotiations with a view to 
concluding a EU/Lithuania free-trade agreement led to 
"substantial progress" between the Community delegation (led by 
Mr. Guggenbuhl of DGI) and the Lithuanian delegation led by Mr. 
Grybauskaite of the Foreign Ministry. So much so that the 
agreement could probably be initialled before the end of the 
month. Defined, notably, were: the text of the draft agreement, 
the list of industrial products for which Lithuania will benefit 
from a period of transition, the provisions on textiles, 
processed agricultural products, customs cooperation and rules 
of origin. Moreover, the positions aligned more as to the 
reciprocal concessions for agricultural products and fishing, 
said a note from the Commission.

<F P=106> [Report by Keith Harper, Julie Wolf, and Seumas Milne: </F>
"Euro-court Extends UK Workers' Rights"] 
  [Text] A far-reaching European Court decision affecting 
the rights of millions of British workers threw the Government 
on the defensive last night over its failure to give employees a 
voice in their futures. 
  In a ruling variously interpreted as a devastating blow to 
the Government and a matter of little practical consequence, the 
European Court of Justice said that workers, representatives had 
a right to be informed and consulted about large-scale 
redundancies or when a business was transferred from one owner 
to another, including when it was privatised. 
  The European Commission said that Britain would have to 
change its legislation on workers rights. Padraig Flynn, the 
social affairs commissioner, said: "There is no question that 
change will have to be put in place to satisfy the Court ruling." 
  Mr Flynn would not say whether he thought the ruling would 
open the way to compensation claims by workers whose jobs were 
switched from the public to the private sector in the 1980's. 
  However, last night, Jack Dromey, the Transport and General 
Workers Union [TGWU] official in charge of public services, 
called on the Government to negotiate compensation for all those 
who had suffered as a result of compulsory competitive tendering 
-- or fight the unions through the courts. 
  He said the TGWU would take legal action against any local 
authority which tried to derecognise unions. "We believe this 
decision will put an end to derecognition in public services." 
  The Employment Minister, Michael Forsyth, said that the 
Government would have to consider the judgment, but its effects 
were extremely limited. Employers would not have to recognise 
unions as a result of redundancy and transfers, but workers 
would have to be consulted. 
  John Hendy, QC, chairman of the Institute of Employment 
Rights, said: "The significance of the decision is not the 
question of possible compensation, but a step towards democracy 
at the workplace." 
  The ruling led to a clash between John Major and Labour's 
environment spokesman, Jack Straw, during the European election 
press conferences yesterday. Mr Major said it was based on a 
European directive approved by the Labour government in 1975. 
  But Mr Straw insisted that the ruling was based on a law 
signed by the Government 13 years ago. "It is now going to be 
enforced to give British workers the same rights as those 
enjoyed by workers across Europe." 
  John Monks, the TUC [Trade Union Council] general secretary, 
described the decision as a "devastating blow" for the 
Government. "Once again British workers have been shown to be 
denied rights that are accepted in law in all other European 
Union countries." 
  The rulings came in two cases brought by the European 
Commission against the Government for incorrectly implementing 
EU (European Union) legislation. The first concerned the 
acquired rights directive -- known as Tupe in Britain -- which 
protects workers' wages and conditions in a sale or transfer of 
their enterprise. The second involved legislation protecting 
their rights in collective redundancies. 
  British unions have used Tupe to challenge the practice of 
worsening pay and conditions when public services are 
transferred to the private sector. A series of court cases, 
including a ruling involving binmen in Eastbourne, culminated 
last year in Government acceptance that Tupe covered 
privatisations. 
  The Commission brought its case on Tupe after a series of 
complaints from workers and unions. The Court upheld the 
Commission's arguments on almost every count. 
  The key part of its ruling was that the Government had 
failed 
to meet the requirement that employers consult and inform 
workers whose jobs were transferred. One aspect of this was the 
Government's failure to set up a mechanism for consulting 
workers when employers refused to recognise unions. The Court 
also ruled that the Government had failed to "provide for 
effective sanctions" against employers. 
  The ruling on collective redundancies also said that the 
Government had failed to legislate for consultation and 
information. In addition, Britain's definition of collective 
redundancy was too narrow.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Worries Over Tax Take"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 8 -- The fall in the tax take 
in the first few months of the year is currently the most 
worrying aspect of Italy's public finances as far as the 
European Union [EU] is concerned, the head of the European 
Commission's economic services Giovanni Ravasio said here today. 
  "The situation isn't easy to assess," he added on the eve of 
a visit to Rome during which he will meet the Berlusconi 
government's economics ministers as part of the multilateral 
European surveillance being applied to the Italian accounts 
under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  According to Ravasio, current thinking at Commission 
headquarters is that the Italian taxation system must be put 
into order, a topic that he said will be on the agenda during 
the EU summit on the island of Corfu at the end of the month. 
  "When a system is too complicated, it's unlikely to be 
efficient," he said, pointing out that far more taxes are levied 
on the Italians than on their counterparts in other EU nations. 
The complexity of the system also holds down the size of the 
tax take, he asserted. 
  Ravasio pointed out that the International Monetary Fund had 
also given Italy the same advice, adding that Treasury Minister 
Lamberto Dini seems "very active" on this front too. 
  Ravasio's mission is not linked to granting Italy the third 
ECU2 billion tranche of an EU loan granted to the Amato 
government to help tide over the public finance crisis. 
  "The Italian Government has still taken no decision on the 
issue, and no request has yet been received for the third 
tranche," he said. 
  The EU finance ministers are given the job of monitoring the 
European economies under the Maastrict Treaty to check whether 
they are making progress towards their convergence targets. 
Achieving them should culminate in turning the ECU into 
Europe's single currency. 
  "The objective is to reach the end of 1996 with a majority 
of 
the countries ready to adopt a single currency in 1997," said 
Ravasio. "The Commission's latest studies seem to show that this 
is not impossible."

Lockerbie Trial"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Libya wants a trial at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague for two of its 
citizens accused of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, Libya's 
ambassador to Rome 'Abd-al-Rahman Shalqam told Lower House 
Foreign Affairs Committee chief Mirko Tremaglia on Wednesday [8 
June]. 
  Libyan authorities will suggest that an all-Scottish jury be 
created for the trial of the two, wanted in Scotland and the 
United States on charges of having planned the bombing. 
  Two hundred and seventy people died when a Pan Am jet 
exploded in flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 
December 21 1988. 
  According to Tremaglia, the Libyan Government will send the 
Italian authorities "a written statement on their decision, 
which is aimed at finding a definitive resolution for the issue." 
  The Libyan ambassador argued that such a step would meet 
demands of successive United Nations resolutions on the 
question, Tremaglia said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to a BILD AM SONNTAG 
report, Russian Mafia organizations are in possession of the 
most important parts for building atom bombs and could use them 
to blackmail Western and Arab states. This follows from 
intelligence reports for the Federal Government that were 
discussed at the cabinet meeting on 8 June, the newspaper writes. 
  "There is the serious danger that criminal organizations 
could try to blackmail states by using such highly toxic 
radiation material. Therefore, it is time for us to act," the 
tabloid quotes Minister of State in the Chancellor's Office 
Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union) as saying. 
According to BILD AM SONNTAG, he also said that Western 
intelligence services are concerned that Mafia organizations 
before long could threaten to detonate smaller atom bombs or 
release highly toxic radiation material. 
  The Federal Intelligence Service (BND) will take part in 
planned U.S.-Russian cooperation against the nuclear Mafia. 
Schmidbauer said that BND staff should in the future be 
permitted by law to examine radiation material or bring such 
material to Germany for examination. Exact analyses are the 
prerequisite for assessing and warding off dangers, Schmidbauer 
said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
Chairman Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said that the last 
election Sunday [12 June] was a "very good day for the CDU and 
the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]." An important stage had 
been achieved but there was "absolutely no reason to give the 
all-clear signal," Kohl said after the meeting of the CDU 
Presidium and Executive Committee that discussed the results of 
the European and municipal elections. 
  The European election was "not a test election for the 
Bundestag election," the CDU chairman said. An additional voter 
turnout of 20 percent as expected for 16 October will lead to 
different decisions on the part of the voters. Nevertheless, 
the result of the European election refuted those who said that 
the CDU was on the decline. For the good results achieved by his 
own party, the election of the federal president played a major 
role for the motivation of the CDU supporters. The economic 
upswing that set in in the spring and the clinging to a clear 
European course have also been helpful. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] had banked on 
"pessimism and on trying to make the situation appear as worse 
than it is. The voters did not support that." Through its 
pessimism the SPD did not make any gains but, willy-nilly, 
helped the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the new 
laender. The chancellor described the Alliance 90/Greens as 
"profiteers of the weakness of the SPD." It was now time for 
the Social Democrats to clearly declare their support for an 
alliance between the SPD and Greens, the chancellor said. He 
said that the poor result of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] was a result of the low voter turnout. For him it 
was obvious that the FDP would be voted into the Bundestag 
again. The chancellor described as particularly encouraging -- 
particularly because of the effects abroad -- the poor 
performance of the Republikaner.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- The Christian Social Union [CSU] 
leadership assessed the election to the European Parliament in 
Germany as a "vote for Kohl." Before the beginning of the 
executive committee session of his party in Munich on Monday [13 
June], CSU Chairman Theo Waigel said that Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] challenger Rudolf Scharping had made the 
mistake of underestimating the chancellor. "Scharping does not 
look so good, this is an open secret." 
  Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber said: "It was 
certainly a vote for Kohl. The SPD has to decide whether it was 
also an anti-Scharping vote." 
  After the CSU's surprisingly good performance, Waigel called 
on his own party immediately to start the work for the Landtag 
and Bundestag elections in the fall. "We are not arrogant now." 
Bavaria's SPD, with its chairwoman Renate Schmidt, has been 
dampened. Schmidt does not have an answer to questions of the 
future and she is trying to divert the people's attention from 
it with cheap propaganda tricks, it was stated.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party

his party will have the strength of a parliamentary group in the 
next Bundestag. It is very likely that it will not be possible 
to prevent the PDS from entering the Bundestag again, Gysi told 
DPA on Monday [13 June]. 
  After the very good performance in the municipal elections 
in 
the east and the European elections, Gysi stated that the PDS 
will at least get three direct mandates, "but it might also be 
five to 10." The 5-percent hurdle can also be overcome. In 
Gysi's opinion, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
still has not been able to gain a foothold in the new laender. 
It does not have any relation to reality and to history in the 
east.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Alliance 90/Greens regard their 
success in the European election as signalling the wish of many 
people for a political change in the FRG. On Monday [13 June] 
Executive Committee spokeswoman Marianne Birthler and Executive 
Committee spokesman Ludger Volmer called on the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to declare itself in favor of 
a clear reform policy, in order jointly to replace Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's coalition in the Bundestag election. The chances 
for Red-Green in the government have not yet been missed, it was 
stated. 
  "We hope that the SPD will still make it," Volmer stated 
before journalists in Bonn. His party will continue to put 
pressure on the Social Democrats -- "Rudolf Scharping will not 
get rid of us." The Greens have finally established themselves 
as the third political force in Germany, he said. 
  It is true that SPD Chairman Scharping is the loser of the 
European election. However, Kohl continues to be the main 
opponent. He alone benefits from false promises and vague fears 
of the people. He does not have any recipes for overcoming the 
problems of the future. This has to be made even clearer to the 
voters in the next few months, also by the Social Democrats, who 
must not adjust to Kohl's policy any longer. "There is a need 
for a tough opposition to Kohl's government" -- if necessary, 
the Greens will "also fight for the SPD." 
  Claudia Roth, European frontrunner of the Greens, warned the 
Christian Democrats against taking the party of Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi into their European parliamentary 
group. In this way, the ban on the right-wing extremists by the 
democratic parties in Europe would be undermined, she said.

  [Text] Bonn June 10 (CTK) -- Some of the postwar decrees 
of Czechoslovak President Edvard Benes contradict international 
law embedded in the valid Czech Constitution, the Sudeten German 
Landsmannschaft (SL) says in a statement issued in Munich today. 
  The statement has come in reaction to a complaint recently 
lodged with the Brno-based Constitutional Court by a Czech 
citizen of German nationality living in Liberec, North Bohemia, 
who demands that some of Benes's decrees be revised and possibly 
rescinded. 
  Not mentioning the name of Benes, the SL's statement says 
that the legal order of a democratic state cannot be built on 
the "moving sands" of the decrees of a "self-styled president" 
that it says contradict international law. The Sudeten German 
Landsmannschaft would welcome it if the Czech Constitutional 
Court "demonstrate such a sovereignty," which is characteristic 
of the Constitutional Court in Germany, the SL says. 
  "The abolition of certain decrees would by no means 
destabilise the Czech Republic's legal system," the statement 
says. "The abrogation of the decrees on `forced labour,' the 
dissolution of the German University in Prague and the German 
Evangelic Church, the "recolonisation of the Sudetenland," and 
on "legalising crimes committed against the expelled," would 
mean a chance for a new fundamental beginning, the SL believes. 
  The abolition of these decrees would not automatically mean 
the renewal of the initial legal state, the SL says. It 
believes, however, that it is necessary that members of the 
"groups discriminated against thus far" -- and not only Sudeten 
Germans -- be able to participate in the Czech Republic's 
development as full-fledged citizens.

  [Editorial Report] The 19 May Paris weekly L'EXPRESS 
reported the results of an IFOP [French Public Opinion 
Institute] poll conducted on behalf of the magazine on 4 and 5 
May among 961 individuals over 18. Respondents were asked to 
express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction regarding the 
candidacy of various potential contenders for the presidency of 
the Republic. 
  Some 52 percent were satisfied with Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, compared with 45 percent who were not. Fifty percent 
were satisfied with European Union (EU) Commission President 
Jacques Delors, against 41 percent, and 47 percent liked Rally 
for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, against 50 percent 
who did not. Minister of Interior Charles Pasqua got a positive 
vote from 38 percent, compared to a negative vote of 57 percent. 
French Democratic Union (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing 
was approved of by 30 percent, compared with 66 percent who 
disapproved of him. Socialist Party (PS) leader Michel Rocard 
satisfied 30 percent of the respondents, compared with 65 
percent dissatisfied respondents, and Eurodeputy candidate 
Bernard Tapie was approved of by 29 percent, and disapproved of 
by 67 percent of the respondents. 
  Another question respondents were asked was: "If you had a 
choice between Chirac and Balladur, whom would you elect as 
president?" Overall, Balladur was chosen by 55 percent, Chirac 
by 35 percent, and 10 percent had no opinion. Among RPR-UDF 
voters, 58 percent picked Balladur, compared with 40 percent who 
chose Chirac, while 2 percent expressed no opinion. 
  With regard to the Left, respondents were asked the 
following question: "For which of these candidates would you be 
more likely to vote in each of the following cases?" In a 
Rocard-Chirac race, 40 percent would vote for the PS leader, 
compared with 60 percent who would choose Chirac, while 8 
percent had no opinion. In a Rocard-Balladur race, 38 percent 
would choose the former and 62 percent the latter, with 7 
percent expressing no opinion. In case of a Delors-Chirac race, 
47 percent would choose the EU Commission president and 53 
percent Chirac, with 6 percent expressing no opinion. Finally, 
in a Delors-Balladur race, 41 percent would vote for the former, 
59 percent for the latter, and 7 percent had no opinion.

<F P=106> [Article by Catherine Pegard] </F>
  [Editorial Report] Jack Lang is not talking about it, but 
is preparing for it. At a time when the idea of compelling 
[Socialist Party leader] Michel Rocard to drop out of the 
presidential race if his scores are bad in the European 
Parliament elections is attractive to all those who do not 
believe in him, many would like to push former Culture Minister 
Jack Lang onto the arena. He is receiving letters and telephone 
calls, and he is being pressured. For his part, Lang is 
reflecting. Seriously. He is traveling (he was recently in the 
United States), and is multiplying contacts to "acquire renewed 
energy," as he puts it. 
  The reasoning is simple: if [European Commission President] 
Jacques Delors persists in not returning to the French political 
game--the two men recently had a long conversation about the 
presidential election--Lang's popularity may be a trump card. In 
the latest PARIS MATCH/BVA [Brulle Ville Associates] poll, 41 
percent of the French said they trusted him (compared with 43 
percent for Delors, 28 percent for Rocard). Some of Lang's 
friends also note that Bernard Tapie reportedly affirmed that in 
this case, he himself would not run in 1995. Others are already 
outlining scenarios for the second round: they would prefer that 
Lang face [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur rather than [Rally 
for the Republic leader] Jacques Chirac.

  [Editorial Report] France's relations with Germany and 
the European Union (EU) were the subject of several commentaries 
and interviews in the 7 May Paris weekly LE POINT. 
<H5>  `Malaise' in French-German Relationship </H5>
  According to commentator Alain Dauvergne, while relations 
between France and Germany appear exemplary on the surface and 
their level of cooperation is "unprecedented" in Europe, 
problems do exist between the two countries. He claimed that a 
"malaise" has troubled the relationship for several years ever 
since German unification and Bonn's formulation of new ambitions 
and cited former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas as saying that 
"it is a euphemism to say today that things are not going well 
between the two countries." This "malaise" and the disagreement 
between the two countries stemming from the Bundesbank's 
interest rate policy has given rise to a "vaguely poisonous" 
climate. As an example of the difficulties in the bilateral 
relationship, Dauvergne cited Germany's ambition to have more 
deputies in the European Parliament to account for its greater 
population after unification. While the initiative was not 
"shocking," he questioned the way in which Bonn "literally 
imposed" East German observers on the Parliament immediately 
after unification. He also cited another German ambition, now 
openly advocated by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of obtaining 
a permament seat on the UN Security Council. Dauvergne 
maintained that such moves demonstrate that the Germans now feel 
"more muscular" and "speak louder" in an international context. 
  Dauvergne remarked that Paris has reacted negatively to the 
change in Germany's foreign policy style but is at a loss as to 
how to respond to Bonn's ambition to take a more assertive role 
in international affairs. He maintained Bonn is assuming the 
leadership in Europe because Paris has remained silent. 
According to Dauvergne, since the difficult Maastricht 
referendum, the French, across the political spectrum, seem to 
be "on the defensive" and incapable of playing their traditional 
role of "inventors" of Europe. 
  While expressing skepticism about Germany's intentions, 
Dauvergne recommended taking steps to escape the encroaching 
"malaise" in Franco-German relations. He commented favorably on 
Dumas' call for a "new bilateral start at all levels." 
Dauvergne said that such a process could begin at the 
Franco-German summit at the end of May, although it does not 
appear to be on the agenda. According to German Foreign 
Minister Kinkel, the summit will discuss enlargement of the EU 
to include East European states. According to Dauvergne, while 
the Germans insist they have no intention of "killing Europe," 
it remains to be seen whether their behavior may not lead to 
this very result. 
<H5>  EU Expansion Potentially `Disastrous' </H5>
  In an interview with Dauvergne, the chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Economic Affairs, Jean Francois-Poncet, expressed 
the opinion that expansion of the EU without first undertaking 
institutional reorganization might have "disastrous" 
consequences for Europe. Francois-Poncet maintained that the EU 
will be a 16-member organization functioning with a system 
designed for six, with few chances of meeting future challenges. 
Asked the reason for the "formidable pressure" applied by 
Germany on behalf of adding members, he said it should not be 
concluded that Germany has suddenly become anti-European but 
that, after unification, Bonn thinks that the EU no longer 
matches Europe's political and economic configuration. He also 
argued that Germans feel strongly that with the addition of 
Greece, Portugal, and Spain, the EU became "very Mediterranean," 
a consequence that the French had underestimated. To avoid 
"increasing paralysis," he expressed the hope that a "hard 
nucleus" of member countries will emerge within the EU, a 
subject that should be debated during the 1996 EU conference 
aimed at reviewing the European institutional system. 
  Francois-Poncet also commented on relations between France 
and Germany. He suggested that following the German 
parliamentary elections and the French presidential elections a 
Franco-German seminar be held to prepare for the 1996 EU 
conference and to begin planning for a revision of the 
Franco-German treaty. 
<H5>  Eurodeputy Criticizes German `Arrogance' </H5>
  A commentary by Catherine Pegard criticized Germany's 
lobbying effort in the European Parliament on behalf of EU 
membership for the Scandinavian countries and Austria. Claiming 
that the German efforts were "unprecedented," she wrote that the 
"entire panoply of persuasion" was used, from telephone calls to 
financial "blackmail." Certain deputies such as centrist 
Francois Froment-Meurice--"not a foe of enlargement"--were 
"frankly surprised." According to Pegard, Froment-Meurice said 
he had a bad reaction "when pressure reaches this level of 
arrogance" and warned that "our German friends--indeed, our 
German brothers--should not forge that arrogance may sometimes 
be their worst enemy." 
<H5>  EU Structural Problems Viewed </H5>
  A commentary by Alain Duhamel criticized the proposal to add 
four new members to the EU at a time when, he maintained, the 
Franco-German duo seems to be "short of ideas" and "rather 
devoid of energy." He warned that an increase in the number of 
member countries should not result in "diminished collective 
energy." Complaining that EU executive power is becoming 
increasingly "anemic," he claimed that the rotating six-month 
presidency of the European Council is devalued by imbalances 
that increase with every enlargement of EU membership. He 
insisted that these structural obstacles should be removed 
before the arrival of four new members. The 1996 conference 
that will attempt to tackle these issues will be four years too 
late, Duhamel maintained, adding that by then the EU's best 
defenders "will be writing their memoirs and growing the roses 
of retirement."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi, Bossi Disagree Over </F>
Vote's Significance"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi said here this evening that he sees the European 
elections on Sunday [12 June] as a "significant" political test 
for the government he formed only a few weeks ago. 
  But, in a speech in northern Italy, Northern League leader 
Umberto Bossi, one of the three allies in Berlusconi's 
conservative administration, said the European vote would 
"change not a comma" in the government's and the country's 
situation, whatever the result. 
  According to Berlusconi, he is hoping that the majority -- 
the Northern League, his own Forza Italia and the hard-right 
National Alliance -- would win sufficiently well to increase the 
government's authoritativeness. 
  Another hope he expressed on RAI, the public broadcasting 
corporation's "Electoral Tribune" series, was that the result 
may achieve a greater compactness in the government's ranks, 
which have often seemed riven by emerging dissent. 
  Apparently to further this aim, he told a news and chat show 
on one of the Fininvest channels that Bossi and the Northern 
League, like the judiciary, had played an important role in 
making Italy's change of the political guard possible. 
  In another nod in the League's direction, Berlusconi said he 
favours greater regional autonomy and a fiscal system that 
starts from the periphery. 
  In other points, he appealed to moderately conservative 
Catholics to join what he said was a "moderate majority." 
  In the RAI interview, Berlusconi said he hopes the Italian 
MEPs who go to Strasbourg will be able to represent the 
citizens' interests by pursuing continuity in renewal. 
  Bossi's speech stressed that Sunday's vote is important for 
creating a true "law-making" European parliament which will make 
"good laws" for Europe. He also accused the powers-that-be in 
Europe of wanting to avoid giving the assembly law-making 
powers. He also warned against voting for Forza Italia. "Anyone 
who votes for Forza Italia," he asserted, "knows perfectly well 
what's behind it. Let's stop being hypocritical. It's the old 
that is coming back." 
  In other points, he justified his alliance with Forza Italia 
and the National Alliance for the March 27 general elections by 
saying he was hoping to beat Berlusconi once he had gained an 
improved position. "We are guaranteeing governability," he 
said, "but we don't intend to be subordinate to anyone."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi on Selling Fininvest, </F>
RAI"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Premier Silvio Berlusconi has 
thought of selling off his vast retail-to-media empire Fininvest 
but is in a quandary about potential purchasers, the government 
chief said in a state television interview on Thursday [9 June]. 
  "I will not rule out, in the future, selling off my 
holdings," Berlusconi told the interviewer. "I confess I have 
thought of handing my company over to my five children and to 
those friends who have laboured with me to create it." But, 
said the premier, referring to opposition demands that he 
off-load his businesses, "I have to say that I would not know 
who to sell it to. It just is not that simple." 
  According to Berlusconi Fininvest is now run by others, and 
even his shares are in the hands of trustees, who have formed a 
de facto blind trust for his interests. "My business is now 
something which does not belong to me," the premier said. 
  Berlusconi was at pains to stress that his ownership of 
Fininvest, and particularly of its television interests, in no 
way interfered with his role as premier which, he said, he is 
involved in "one hundred per cent." 
  Fininvest owns three of Italy's eight television stations 
with licenses to broadcast nationally. Some of Fininvest's news 
and current events programmes have been accused of bias towards 
Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. 
  The situation within the Fininvest group is "absolutely 
clear", according to Berlusconi who said that "multiple 
guarantees" exist to safeguard public interests in the field. 
Listing the press, antitrust authorities, and the judiciary, 
the premier added that the best safeguard of all was his own 
conscience. 
  Chatting to journalists after the interview was recorded, 
Berlusconi returned to his recent statement on the RAI's 
allegedly anti-government stance which provoked an outcry. 
  "It did not even enter my mind that the government would 
want 
the RAI to be pro-government. That would have been squalid," 
the premier said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry Minister Vito Gnutti by Franco </F>
Locatelli in Rome; date not given: "Gnutti: Farewell to 
National Electric Power Board Monopoly" -- first paragraph is IL 
SOLE-24 ORE introduction] 
  [Text] A policy supporting industry, new rules for the 
utilities, privatization, reforms at the ministry: These are 
the cornerstones of the government program for Industry Minister 
Vito Gnutti, who explains them for the first time in an 
interview with IL SOLE-24 ORE. But our talk can only begin with 
the event of the moment: the latest eruption of the Sulcis 
[Sardinian coalmine closure] issue on Tuesday [7 June]. 
  [Locatelli] Minister, who has made you more angry? The 
miners demonstrating in front of Palazzo Chigi [government seat] 
for the implementation of the agreements, or Berlusconi when he 
contradicted you? 
  [Gnutti] Neither the miners, who deserve the respect owed to 
people who work, nor Berlusconi, who has concurred with the 
technical criticisms that I expressed on the Sulcis deal, 
regardless of the decision to honor a pact signed by the 
previous government, have made me angry. However, the final 
word has not yet been said. I shall be visiting the Sulcis area 
in person and, as stated in the cabinet memorandum, I shall 
ascertain whether or not there are alternative solutions to the 
gasification plan that will make for better use of public funds 
in promoting real development in the area concerned. 
  [Locatelli] The other surprise aspect of Tuesday's cabinet 
meeting was the lack of decisionmaking regarding the automobile 
industry. Why was that? 
  [Gnutti] The simple truth is that these measures have never 
been discussed at government level, and I personally shall keep 
quiet on the subject, because talking about it would only upset 
the market. All I can say is that we are seeing the first signs 
of recovery in the automobile market, which I find very 
encouraging. 
  [Locatelli] You claim that the best policy to adopt on 
industry at the moment is to remove the constraints rather than 
to provide financing. After the initial action taken by the 
government, what other measures are you thinking about? 
  [Gnutti] We shall do away with the pointless chores, the 
bureaucratic burdens, and the confusion that pervades the 
statute books so as to render the laws governing business as 
simple as possible. The first step addressed taxation. The 
second will address the labor market, and the third the 
environment, on which I shall submit a framework bill clarifying 
rights and duties. 
  [Locatelli] Is the removal of constraints sufficient to 
foster the growth of small businesses? 
  [Gnutti] Of course it is not sufficient, but it is 
essential. 
However, an all-round policy of support for small businesses 
will require a series of new financial measures ranging from the 
creation of a type of NASDAQ or local stock exchanges for small- 
and medium- sized enterprises to the launch of pension funds and 
closed funds. 
  [Locatelli] And to enhance the competitiveness of the few 
major corporations? 
  [Gnutti] The one thing that we cannot do, because in the 
first place Europe forbids it, let alone our free-market 
convictions, is to adopt a policy of aid and financial handouts 
to sectors of industry. But this does not mean that the state 
must take no action. Quite the contrary. It must foster the 
development of the infrastructure and services, reform the 
education and training system, safeguard the environment, and, 
more generally, make the country reliable, on an international 
level as well, so that companies can be a match for the best on 
the market. 
  [Locatelli] The government promises that privatization will 
be one of its battleships, but you have warned, with an eye to 
the public utilities, that there must not be a leap out of the 
frying pan of the state monopoly into the fire of private 
monopoly. Do you mean that new rules are needed for the grid 
utilities? 
  [Gnutti] That is exactly what I mean. We must learn from the 
most advanced experience acquired in other countries, and 
British experience in particular, and set out to create 
authorities monitoring standards of service, to espouse the 
price cap model for charges, to safeguard competition, and to 
adopt the golden share system as a means of guarding against the 
country's major grids being colonized. 
  [Locatelli] What sort of privatization does the government 
have in mind for STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]? 
  [Gnutti] The cabinet has not yet discussed the matter, but I 
think Berlusconi will call ad hoc cabinet meetings toward the 
end of the month to define the privatization strategy and to 
decide on the most appropriate solution for each individual IRI 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] company, for ENI 
[National Hydrocarbons Corporation], or ENEL [National Electric 
Power Board]. However, I can say that, without making an issue 
of it, wherever possible I favor the most appropriate form of 
the public company model. 
  [Locatelli] As far ENEL is concerned, you have long 
advocated separating its power generation, transmission, and 
distribution functions. Can you explain your idea in greater 
detail? 
  [Gnutti] It has to be realized that, in its current form, 
the 
ENEL monopoly is on the wane and that the only natural monopoly 
that makes any sense is one on power transmission lines. Both 
generation (as is already happening as a result of autonomous 
generation) and distribution (via municipal or private 
corporations) can be carried out by a variety of operators. 
This in no way prevents the continued existence of a strong 
body with the capacity to plan, modernize, and expand the 
national electricity grid, but it must be borne in mind that, in 
view of the direction in which Community policy is moving, it 
may not be long before that same body is obliged to rent out its 
lines, for a fair charge, to carry the power that the end 
consumer has purchased from the most competitive supplier. 
  [Locatelli] What will the implications be for ENEL? 
  [Gnutti] It will mean that our major electricity corporation 
will have to be restructured and that its business as a monopoly 
must be kept distinct from the business that it handles within a 
competitive system. It remains to be seen how the restructuring 
operation, provided the whole government agrees to it, can be 
coordinated with privatization. 
  [Locatelli] As regards IRI, on the other hand, it all looks 
easier, as you consider that it is now an empty box. It would 
appear that you would like a receiver appointed in place of [IRI 
Chairman] Prodi. Am I right? 
  [Gnutti] Nothing is further from my mind than the 
appointment 
of a receiver for IRI; what is needed is a chairman who will 
conclude the privatizations in the full light of day, without 
traumatizing the companies or the markets. Anyway, I did not 
invent the notion that IRI has outlived its historical purpose: 
It is a fact that no one can deny. 
  [Locatelli] One last question: You maintain that the 
Industry Ministry must cease to be a structure at the service of 
the minister and become a structure at the service of the 
business world. How do you mean? 
  [Gnutti] The idea is to computerize the entire ministry so 
as 
to create electronic centers throughout the country, probably on 
the premises of the chambers of commerce, to act as local 
ministry offices, and to speed up and clarify all the procedures 
for which the ministry is currently responsible, decentralizing 
the ministry's functions without depriving it of its 
coordinating role at national level; on the contrary, the local 
centers will keep it supplied with reliable, up-to-date 
information regarding the problems faced by the various 
industrial areas. As I see it, this is also what federalism is 
about.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government Presents Tax-Employment </F>
Package"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- A major package of tax 
reforms and measures aimed at boosting employment was given the 
green light in a lengthy cabinet meeting, Wednesday [8 June]. 
The government "aims to avoid economic recovery without more 
employment," explained Premier Silvio Berlusconi as ministers 
emerged to present the measures approved today. 
  "For the first time in at least a decade," he told 
journalists, "we have set ourselves goals which can be reached 
without adding to the state deficit; for the first time fiscal 
policy is not aimed at hiking revenue but at development; for 
the first time measures are tailored for all sectors of the 
economy, and not only for large-scale industry and for 
employees, but also for small and medium industry and 
self-employed workers." 
  The premier outlined a three-stage attack, with economyic 
and 
employment-boosting initiatives in the first 100 days of the new 
administration to exploit recovery which is already on its way, 
then the 1995 finance bill, followed by a sweeping 
reorganisation of Italy's byzantine tax system. 
  Berlusconi promised no new taxes or higher tax brackets in 
the finance bill, and said that the third stage would include 
major steps toward "fiscal federalism," or decentralisation of 
the tax system. He also pledged a shift from direct to indirect 
taxes, "gradually shifting the onus of levies onto luxury and 
non-essential goods and services." 
  Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti was given the job of 
providing a point-by-point explanation of the measures in the 
six-paragraph law decree approved by the cabinet today. A law 
decree goes into effect immediately, but must receive approval 
from both houses of parliament within 90 days, after which it 
becomes null and void, or has to be reapproved by the cabinet 
and presented to parliament once again. 
  According to a note from the Finance Ministry, the measures 
approved today will generate 450,000 new jobs by the end of 1996. 
  Presenting what he described as a decree with "a human 
face," 
Tremonti explained that young people under 32 years of age, 
unemployed people, the handicapped and those laid off from their 
jobs under government-sponsored schemes will be given tax 
incentives for setting up their own companies: in the first year 
of activity all forms of taxes and levies would be waived and 
replaced by a two million lire (1,250 dollar) all-inclusive 
payment, rising to three million lire for the second year and 
four million lire for the third. 
  Private companies, those in the catering field and 
self-employed professionals for the next three years will be 
allowed tax "credits" equal to 25 percent of the income paid to 
employees hired over and above the number employed at the time 
when the decree goes into force. Companies reinvesting more 
than the average ploughed back for development over the past 
five years will enjoy tax breaks of 50 percent of this extra sum 
in 1994 and 1995. 
  Stock market investors can now opt for a one-off 
all-inclusive tax on dividends of 12.5 percent, or else continue 
to add dividend earnings to other revenue which must be declared 
in yearly tax returns. Under the current system, all dividends 
have ten percent withdrawn at source, and are then declared on 
tax forms where the source payment can be deducted from the 
total amount of taxes owed. 
  In what Tremonti said was an effort to encourage greater 
transparency amongst companies, smaller firms are being prompted 
to seek stock market quotation in a measure offering a 16 point 
reduction of company taxes for the next three years. 
  The law decree approved today, Tremonti added, also does 
away 
with a number of levies described as "useless" by Premier 
Berlusconi. These include such taxes as the one on each 
refrigeration unit owned by catering sector companies, which 
bring a negligible amount into state coffers and provide 
bureaucratic nightmares for those who have to pay them. 
  Tremonti told journalists that the new law decree also 
marked 
a breakthrough in the way legislation is drawn up, with great 
care being taken to make the measures comprehensible to the 
uninitiated. The decree states explicitly that any contradictory 
norms on the law books are superseded. Ministers were at pains 
to stress that the new measures would have no negative effects 
on revenue and the public sector borrowing requirement. 
  Discussed but not approved in today's cabinet meeting, which 
ended slightly after 2100 (1900 GMT) this evening, was a decree 
introducing changes to enhance flexibility in Italy's labour 
market. The decree will be "approved in the next few days," said 
Tremonti. The cabinet is scheduled to meet next Tuesday [14 
June]. 
  This legislation will include measures to increase part-time 
work, encourage professional training, and introduce lower-paid 
contracts for employees taken on for training purposes. 
Approval of these initiatives, said Premier Berlusconi, has 
been suspended until after a meeting requested by unions. 
  Mooted initiatives to boost car sales, including a 
suspension 
of road tax for owners of new vehicles, which have received much 
coverage in the press recently, did not even come up for 
discussion in today's meeting, one cabinet member said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini by Marco </F>
Cecchini on 9 June; place not given: "No Increase in Fiscal 
Pressure"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Are you pleased? "Very pleased." The 
minister made a fist: The package introduced Wednesday [8 June] 
is a combination of "strong" measures, he said, which will have 
no repercussions on our financial situation, "for the simple 
reason that it is self-financing." 
  In other words, budgetary constraints "will be honored." 
True, there is a more general tendency for revenue to decrease, 
"because the effect of the various once only measures adopted by 
[former Prime Ministers] Ciampi and Amato is coming to an end." 
  But the government remains committed to "not altering 
overall 
fiscal pressure." He also talked about the response of the 
markets, Italy, the European Monetary Union, the lira, 
inflation, and coming moves on the public finance front expected 
at the end of the month. 
  Lamberto Dini covered the whole field, the day after the 
Berlusconi's first real test in finance and employment policy. 
The treasury minister reaffirmed his commitment to stringency, 
having been general manager of the Bank of Italy for 15 years. 
  He clearly reaffirmed his utmost attention to the problem of 
the debt, to inflation, and to Europe, without losing sight of 
the objective of increasing the levels of growth and employment. 
  Yesterday he met in Bonn with Theo Waigel, his counterpart 
at 
the German Finance Ministry. Italy's "innovations" were also 
broached at the meeting, which was described as "extremely 
cordial." 
  In this regard, Waigel displayed "the utmost interest, the 
utmost understanding, and no anxiety" with regard to the 
government headed by Silvio Berlusconi, the treasury minister 
revealed, while describing as "awesome but inevitable" the new 
government's program centered "on the deregulation of labor, 
privatization, and the reform of public finance." CORRIERE 
spoke to Dini after the meeting. 
  [Cecchini] Minister, are you really sure that the package 
will have the desired effect? 
  [Dini] This is both our hope and our belief. 
  [Cecchini] Are you really sure that it will not all 
ultimately place yet another burden on the state budget? 
  [Dini] Look, if the package does work -- and it will work -- 
the resulting higher growth and employment levels will generate 
the necessary resources to compensate for the initial reduction 
in revenue. If it does not work, there will be no reduction in 
revenue. From the budgetary viewpoint, the effect will in any 
case be neutral. 
  [Cecchini] But the markets did not respond with excitement 
to 
its announcement: The lira and government stock remained 
static, but the stock market actually weakened. 
  [Dini] It must be realized that we are in an era of 
globalization. The markets behave according to mainly external 
stimuli. What has happened recently? What has happened is that 
after months of falling interest rates, those active in the 
economy have realized that the scope for further reductions is 
becoming exhausted: Especially in the debentures field, capital 
is shifting to areas where there are greater opportunities for 
profits -- the United States, for instance. 
  [Cecchini] You inherited an unbalanced public finance 
situation from the Ciampi government. Taking account of the 
recession, there is a gap of at least 5 trillion lire in the 
1994 budget. Do you intend to bridge it by means of a possible 
additional package? 
  [Dini] We will have to see; I cannot rule it out as a matter 
of principle. Now we must draw up the new three-year economic 
and financial planning document, which we expect to do by the 
end of the month, but we will have to examine the figures. 
There is a fall in revenue at present, because the effects of 
the once-only measures adopted by Amato and Ciampi are coming to 
an end, and we want to keep overall fiscal pressure unaltered. 
We could take action on tax rates, but the tax pressure must 
remain the same. We will see whether we can bring forward 
measures connected with the 1995 Finance Bill, in which case 
that could bridge the 1994 budget gap. But the issue is still 
open. 
  [Cecchini] Meanwhile, the European Commission is waiting to 
hear whether we will use the third installment of the Community 
loan. 
  [Dini] This too depends on other factors. The European 
loan was negotiated in connection with Amato's three-year 
document in 1992 and is therefore subject to observance of that 
plan. Since then, however, the scenario has completely changed. 
There has been a recession in Europe and a recession in Italy. 
Amato's plan envisaged an initial advance of 100 trillion lire, 
no less, and was based on entirely unrealistic macroeconomic 
hypotheses of expansion. Now we must draw up a new plan and see 
how close we can get to the objectives agreed with Brussels at 
that time. After that we will present it to the Commission; if 
it is acceptable, we will use the third installment; 
otherwise.... 
  [Cecchini] Otherwise, what? 
  [Dini] We will not use it. 
  [Cecchini] You met with Waigel. Did he grant his approval of 
your economic program? 
  [Dini] It is not a matter of granting approval; we do not 
grant our approval to the Germans, and they do not grant us 
theirs. Waigel showed great interest in and appreciation of our 
plans, because these ideas move in the direction of European 
convergence and because, both with regard to the issue of 
employment and with regard to finance, they are in line with the 
pointers issued by all the international bodies, from G-7 to the 
IMF. 
  [Cecchini] With a lira exchange rate of 970 against the 
German mark, did you receive any pressure to rejoin the European 
Monetary System or for a revaluation? 
  [Dini] None. 
  [Cecchini] One last question: Italy has for some time been 
underrepresented in the international bodies; we lost over the 
issues of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development 
[EBRD] and the European bank for the East, and now the issue of 
nominations to the European Commission is about to arise and we 
await a decision on the World Trade Organization. What does the 
government intend to do? 
  [Dini] There has been a great deal of confusion about the 
EBRD: We did not lose; the issue of the deputy presidency will 
be discussed again in 1995. For the World Trade Organization, 
we have our sights set on Renato Ruggiero. As for the rest, our 
policy is to do our utmost to ensure that the country is 
adequately represented.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unions on Government Labor Market </F>
Proposals"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- The decision by the 
government yesterday to delay approval of a decree setting new 
rules for the labor market met with approval from the three 
major trade unions Thursday [9 June] but union officials warned 
they would not give ground on some measures now under study. 
  Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said CISL [Italian 
Confederation of Trade Unions] union leader Sergio D'Antoni, 
"showed wisdom" in deciding to meet the three union federations 
before putting the final touches on the jobs decree; "he 
acknowledged the role of the unions, which have good arguments 
to make." 
  But the head of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of 
Labor] federation, Bruno Trentin, said that Berlusconi's was "an 
electoral move" because "it would have been dangerous to face 
disagreement from the unions at this time. I think the 
government must take our observations into account." 
  Another CGIL official, Guglielmo Epifani, warned that 
Berlusconi "must say clearly whether he intends to take our 
requests into consideration or whether his (meeting unions) is 
purely a courtesy." 
  Trentin and other CGIL officials were all unanimous in 
rejecting the government's plan that would allow companies to 
pay lower wages to youths at their first job and long-term 
unemployed, saying that this would do away with the "equal work 
equal pay" principle and eliminate job security for thousands of 
workers. 
  D'Antoni also labelled the plan draft as presented by Labor 
Minister Clemente Mastella "a mess." 
  The plan for the first time would allow the creation of 
temporary workers' agencies. 
  Epifani said the unions do not challenge the principle of a 
flexible work force but that the same workers will have 
different wage brackets and rights: "It is unacceptable in a 
civil country, it will create conflicts in the work place and 
will undermine the negotiating rights of the unions, young 
workers will be permanently blackmailed." 
  In substance, he concluded, "we will have a more precarious 
and less qualified labor force, exactly the opposite of what we 
need."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mario Talamona: "The Tremonti Curve"] </F>
  [Text] There is no need to emphasize the importance of the 
decisions adopted by yesterday's Council of Ministers, which 
represent the initial nucleus of the "100 days" program of 
Silvio Berlusconi's government in the economic and social policy 
area. With the launching of Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti's 
promised tax decree, and with the forthcoming (but perhaps less 
easy) measures relating to the flexibility and functional 
character of the labor market in sight, the new government is 
demonstrating its intention of doing a serious job. 
  The objective that it is pursuing with determination, given 
its urgency -- that of simultaneously stimulating the recovery 
which is becoming visible, and the possible and necessary 
expansion of job opportunities -- is aimed at removing obstacles 
and hindrances to growth, which have for too long paralyzed 
Italy's economy. 
  Also in terms of method, yesterday's tax "package" has 
nothing of the chronic emergency approach, nor of the comforting 
but useless remedies to which bitter experience has too long 
accustomed us. And the consequences of which are visible to us. 
  Whilst representing solely a relatively limited "advance" on 
the tax reforms which the government intends to develop, over 
time, into a major edifice of simplification and efficiency, the 
measures which have been adopted can have a certain efficacy in 
the current economic situation. But right now, they touch, 
within a relatively short time frame, on certain key points of 
the functioning, or more accurately, the -- in the long term 
paralyzing and unbearable -- malfunctioning of the very 
structure of the Italian economy. 
  Moreover, the package consists, to a large extent, of 
provisions which together seek to create a (minimal) 
relationship of trust between the state and taxpayers. As first 
steps on the road toward rationalizing tax structures and a 
gradual shift of the tax burden from direct to indirect 
taxation, in particular in support of production and hence of 
jobs, these provisions mark out the route which the government 
will be taking. Moreover, not a few of the measures which have 
been adopted reflect the need to begin to move decisively toward 
a substantial modernization of the system in a European 
direction. To the immediate objective of providing incentives 
to improve companies' capacity to generate new productive 
thrusts, new employment, new income, and to providing immediate 
incentives to the formation of new entrepreneurship (also in the 
form of self-employment), is added to the partial detaxing of 
reinvested profits and the introduction of the "dry dividend 
tax" on stock exchange listed companies. 
<H5>  Tax Parity </H5>
  They are the first steps too in the direction of the 
essential tax parity of financial activities, in favor of 
companies and, more generally, of productive investment. One 
may wonder whether these initial measures, aimed at creating 
jobs, may not perchance threaten the other essential target to 
be attained: that of reducing the budget deficit and, 
indirectly, achieving monetary stability and the lowering of 
interest rates. 
  The conviction (and the commitment to ensure) that this will 
not happen, as a result of the increase in income and hence of 
the tax base as a result of the stimuli to expansion and the 
economic efficiency of the tax reductions contained in the 
government's measures, lead us to hope for the arrival, also in 
theory, of a "Tremonti curve" in place of the Laffer curve.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Sector Borrowing Requirement </F>
Declines in First Quarter"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Italy's public sector 
borrowing requirement [PSBR] declined by 18 percent in the first 
quarter of the year against the same quarter in 1993, the 
Treasury reported today and said the figure came to 42.399 
trillion lire (26.23 billion dollars), a quarterly PSBR nine 
trillion below the 51.657 trillion disclosed at the end of March 
last year. 
  Over the first three months of the year, spending came to 
132.032 trillion lire (81.7 billion dollars) against revenues of 
101.715 trillion lire leaving a net balance of 30.317 trillion 
to finance, plus 12.071 trillion lire generated by Treasury 
management operations. 
  The release of these figures today boosted cautious optimism 
on the prospect of lowering the PSBR also over the longer term. 
Yesterday, the studies center of the national manufacturers 
association, Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian 
Industry], estimated PSBR for the first five months of the year 
at 75.4 trillion lire (46.66 billion dollars), against 87,800 
trillion lire (54.33 billion dollars) for the same period in 
1993, but would not dismiss worries about exceeding the PSBR 
forecast for the full year. 
  The forecast deficit for 1994 drafted by the government led 
by Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is 159 trillion lire (98.39 
billion dollars) and this figure has been spoken of as reliable 
by the new economic team installed by Premier Silvio Berlusconi. 
  If the trend reported for the first quarter continues as is, 
the PSBR would come to 169.552 trillion lire by December 31, 
more than 10.5 trillion lire over target, but Treasury 
technicians said account must be taken of the range of variables 
on both the spending and revenues sides which condition budget 
management. Among the factors conditioning the figures for the 
first quarter were the virtual paralysis of public investments 
and the reduction of debt servicing thanks to falling interest 
rates. 
  Even taking these variables into consideration, said the 
Confindustria studies center, "rigorous conduct on the side of 
the public administration" could lead to a deficit for the full 
year of 152 to 154 trillion lire.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD: EU Single Currency All or </F>
Nothing"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Paris, June 8 -- "Either everyone or nothing" 
must be the rule for the creation of a single European currency, 
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said here today on the 
fringe of the OECD ministerial meeting. 
  "I think the single currency is a problem that must be 
treated as indivisible," said Martino, an economist by trade, of 
ideas that the currency could be introduced for some European 
Union [EU] countries before others. "Either it's single, or 
it's not." 
  Martino was speaking on the eve of a visit to Rome by a 
European Commission delegation with the task of reporting on 
Italian progress towards the targets set for launching the 
single currency. 
  According to Martino, whose views are generally strongly 
free-market, setting domestic finances to right is "obviously 
necessary and desirable," but he claimed it was a problem apart 
from the single currency. 
  "I don't believe in gradualism, which can be applied to 
divisible problems such as tariffs. These can be reduced 
gradually," he asserted. "In my view, the monetary crisis in 
September 1992 confirms the validity of the idea. You can't 
achieve a single currency by freezing exchange rates; it's 
unsatisfactory. My idea is that all those who are in the EU 
should be in (the single currency)." 
  Martino also said he does not agree with the idea that 
enlarging the EU may prove a hurdle to extending its political 
integration: "But if that were true, I think it is a price that 
would be worth paying." 
  On Italy's economic prospects, Martino said he sees "serious 
indications" of recovery and would expect effective government 
to be able to boost it without creating inflation. 
  He also claimed that Berlusconi found the public deficit in 
worse shape than expected, though he admitted that, in 1993, 
while the public debt had risen to 119.5 percent of gross 
domestic product, the public deficit was less than 10 percent 
and dropped about half a percent last year. "There is movement 
in the right direction," he commented. 
  According to Martino, the terms of the debate at the OECD 
seem to have changed, from considering employment in 
macroeconomic terms to a microeconomic approach. He also said 
that employment will be a major point on the agenda at the Group 
of Seven summit in Naples in July. 
  In other points, Martino said that, in the next few days, 
the 
Italian Government would make a linked series of proposals "to 
be discussed with our allies" on who should get which jobs at 
the summit of a series of international organisations. Due to a 
series of changes of the guard, the top jobs are becoming 
available at the European Commission, the OECD, GATT, or rather 
the World Trade Organisation that is to succeed it, and the 
Western European Union. The appointments should be considered 
"as a whole, not one name at a time," said Martino. 
  On the fringe of the OECD meeting, Martino met European 
Commission Deputy President, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the 
candidates to succeed Jacques Delors as the Commission's 
presidency.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Alitalia Management, Unions Unite </F>
on Recapitalization"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Agreement reached by 
Alitalia, the indebted Italian flagcarrier airline, and the 
trade unions came today as a unified call for fresh capital and 
"the recovery and development of Alitalia as a great carrier 
capable of competing on the world market," said a company 
communique issued today. 
  The understanding worked out late Wednesday [8 June] will 
clear the way for the resumption of negotiations for the merger 
of Alitalia and the airline's domestic subsidiary, ATI [Italian 
Air Freight Lines], and for returning flying personnel to their 
full schedules through to the end of the month. 
  On re-capitalization, the communique said the labor side is 
calling for at least 1.5 trillion lire (928 million dollars) and 
that both the unions and management agree that the idea of 
assigning Alitalia the status of a regional carrier should be 
dropped. 
  On the sensitive areas of excess staff and cost-cutting, the 
company referred to the unbreakable link between "recovery and 
development" and the need to "pursue the objectives" set forth 
in the three-year restructurization plan on reducing operation 
costs and boosting productivity. 
  In this area, industry sources reported today, the airline 
is 
insisting on curbing running costs by 12 percent, the workforce 
by 20 or some 4,000 workers, and hiking productivity by 25 
percent. All the while, Alitalia is committed to "re-defining 
organizational processes and optimizing all the group's 
resources," that is, said these sources, that the number of 
future layoffs will have to be agreed to by the unions. 
  Also coming into play will be such safety-net features as 
profession training to enhance mobility within the group, 
especially on the side of the administration. Also promised was 
that the Alitalia-ATI merger "will not have fallout in the 
Naples area," where the activities of the group will be 
transferred and that changes in work rules for flight personnel, 
hours in the air, rest period and the like will be dealt with in 
line with the wage pact agreement of July 1993, "taking into 
account the company's state of crisis." 
  Speaking for the labor side, Valter Cerfeda of the CGIL 
[Italian General Confederation of Labor] and Paolo Brutti of the 
FILT-CGIL said the problem of re-capitalization will have to be 
taken up with the government, "without forays aide from the 
individual ministers." The joint statement said the efforts of 
Alitalia management and the unions could be nullified if the 
right choices are not made by the government. "There can be no 
attempt to maintain a flagcarrier airline if sufficient 
resources for investments and development are not provided," 
said the statement.

<F P=106> [Report by David Marsh in London and Lionel Barber in </F>
Luxembourg: "Fears Raised Over Splits in EU Parliament"] 
  [Text] Governments across Europe yesterday expressed 
concern about the fragmentation of the European Parliament after 
elections that saw a strong shift to the right on the Continent 
offset by Labour's sweeping victory in the UK. 
  In the immediate aftermath of the results, Mr Achille 
Occhetto resigned as leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, 
the main Italian opposition party. And Mr Edouard Balladur, the 
French prime minister, signalled a possibly more nationalist 
stance by his government. 
  Polling last Thursday [9 June] and on Sunday was dominated 
by 
a mixture of protest voting and apathy in many EU [European 
Union] member states. 
  The new 567-member parliament, in which Socialist and allied 
parties look likely to form the largest grouping with an 
estimated 213 seats, will have increased powers. 
  But the record low turnout across Europe -- down to 56.5 per 
cent from 58.5 per cent in the last election in 1989 -- may 
constrain the parliament's abilty to play a fuller role as the 
EU's sole directly- elected institution. In spite of the strong 
showing by conservatives in Germany Italy, Spain, Netherlands 
and Denmark, co-operation among rightwing MEPs [members of the 
European Parliament] in the new parliament is likely to be 
hampered by bickering over the composition of the European 
People's party [EPP] group, traditionally dominated by Christian 
Democrats. 
  Fragmentation of the rightwing presence has been increased 
by 
the strong showing of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's 
Forza Italia movement, which won 30.6 per cent of the votes, up 
nearly 10 points from the general elections in March. 
  Mr Leo Tindemans, a former Belgian premier and leader of the 
EPP in Strasbourg, insisted yesterday that his grouping did not 
want to work with Forza Italia on account of the latter's 
coalition alliance with neo-fascists. 
  Meanwhile, senior German officials expressed concern about 
the risk of unpredictable factions in the parliament disrupting 
Bonn's plan to work closely with the newly-elected assembly. 
  They drew attention to the election of maverick French and 
Italian MEPs from the right which could leave between 80 and 100 
MEPs unattached to formal left or rightwing party groupings at 
Strasbourg. 
  Bonn's worries about co-operation with the parliament when 
Germany takes over the six monthly EU presidency next month took 
some gloss off the surprise victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
Christian Democrats in Sunday's poll. A confident Mr Kohl 
predicted yesterday he would win the country's general election 
in October . 
  In France, Mr Balladur voiced concern about the diversity of 
policies and parties represented in Strasbourg. "Fragmentation 
among too many lists threatens to weaken France at a European 
level," he said. He added that the poll, which resulted in a 
sharp swing to left and rightwing French dissident parties, had 
shown that voters wanted French interests to be better 
represented in Europe. 
  Elsewhere, ministers and officials warned about the twin 
dangers of voter indifference and the swing to anti-Maastricht 
parties. 
  Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister, said 
the low turnout was "really disappointing," while Mr Hans Van 
den Broek, the Brussels commissioner for external political 
affairs, said: "The credibility of the European union and our 
institutions are at stake." 
  It also emerged yesterday that Mr Kohl is playing a crucial 
role in trying to achieve a compromise over the succession to Mr 
Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. 
  Mr Berlusconi is to meet Mr Kohl in Bonn on Thursday in the 
Italian leader's first high-level European diplomatic meeting 
since assuming office a month ago. 
  Italy is being courted furiously by the contenders for the 
presidency job, including Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade 
negotiator, Mr Ruud Lubbers, prime minister of the Netherlands, 
and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier, who is being 
backed by France and Germany.

<F P=106> [Article by Pauline Green, leader of the UK Labour group at </F>
the European Parliament: "Parliament Must Play to Its 
Strengths"] 
  [Text] The votes have been counted. The new parliament 
starts work on July 19. Can it make the most of its new powers? 
Or will it sink into oblivion for the next five years? 
  The parliament has strengths and weaknesses, some not of its 
own making. It must play to its strengths and try to eliminate 
those handicaps that can be eliminated. 
  Some weaknesses are inherent. The need to work in nine (soon 
12) languages means that debates will never have the cut and 
thrust of the House of Commons. 
  Where the parliament does well, however, is in influencing 
legislation and carrying out the nitty-gritty of parliamentary 
scrutiny, shaping the budget and monitoring and questioning 
civil servants' actions. 
  Every year the parliament adopts thousands of amendments to 
draft legislation reshaping the laws that affect us in important 
areas such as consumer protection, environmental standards, 
social legislation, equal opportunities and banking. Through 
its budgetary powers it redirects spending to priority areas. 
  Even before Maastricht reinforced its powers, most 
parliamentary amendments ended up on the statute book in 
directives and regulations adopted by the Council of Ministers. 
Under Maastricht, important areas of legislation fall under the 
"co-decision" procedure and are adopted jointly by parliament 
and the Council. Parliament's influence on legislation can only 
grow. 
  In particular, the right to say "no" -- to veto draft 
legislation, to blow the whistle on behalf of our constituents - 
will be crucial for the parliament's public perception. 
  Some national parliaments act virtually as a rubber stamp in 
adopting legislation proposed by governments. In this respect, 
the European Parliament does better than many national 
parliaments. 
  National governments want parliament to continue with the 
ludicrous system of spreading its activities over three 
countries. Most parliamentary work is carried out in Brussels 
but once a month the whole show moves to Strasbourg for plenary 
sittings, and a large proportion of the secretariat is based in 
Luxembourg. 
  Brussels should be the single site of parliament's 
activities, close to the other institutions it has to 
scrutinise, and in the same town as the European press corps, 
representatives of interest groups and member states' embassies. 
  Another problem is that the treaties negotiated and ratified 
by national governments now include far too many complex 
procedures for involving parliament in European legislation. 
  The 1996 conference should seek to simplify and standardise 
these rules by applying a streamlined co-decision procedure to 
all areas where Council adopts legislation by a qualified 
majority. 
  The press, too, having frequently pointed to parliament's 
increased importance, must follow this up by increased coverage. 
  The parliament should also put its own house in order. A 
good start was made last year with a complete overhaul of the 
rules of procedure, allowing parliament to concentrate its time 
on more important matters where it has power, to limit 
possibilities for filibustering by small groups, and to improve 
management. 
  In the new parliament, the centre-right will be far more 
divided and fragmented, with an extreme right contingent 
introducing instability and even conflict. Handling this will 
present a challenge. Even more than in the past, the Socialist 
group will have to lead the parliament despite the absence of an 
overall majority for any group. 
  All in all, the new parliament has a good chance of using 
its 
new powers effectively. The big question is how national 
governments will handle the 1996 constitutional revision. We 
look forward to seeing how they face up to their 
responsibilities.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Arturo Guatelli: "Rethink Brussels"] </F>
  [Text] Right-wing Europe has defeated left-wing Europe, 
with the sole exception of the Labour Party's success in 
Britain. The winners are [German Chancellor] Kohl and [Italian 
Prime Minister] Berlusconi, as well as "outsiders" Tapie [French 
Radical Energy list leader] and Billiers [French "The Other 
Europe" list]. [Spanish Prime Minister] Gonzalez and Rocard 
[French European Solidarity list leader] have lost. Without 
exception, however, all have been defeated by European 
abstentionism, the worst on the market. 
  This result is unequivocal, and it affects almost every 
country in the European Union [EU]: More or less half the 
voters did not turn up at the polling stations, thus evading 
their right-duty to take part in the renewal of the European 
Parliament, whose legitimacy lies precisely in universal 
suffrage. What are the reasons for this betrayal? 
  Condemning -- with no right of appeal -- those who did not 
vote would denote a hypocritical and unreasonable attitude. If 
the European elections have been ignored, it means the citizens 
did not grasp the importance of what was at stake. The 
political forces failed to apply the necessary European 
pedagogy. None of them managed to explain the European 
Parliament's role and potential. The quest for support -- not 
only in Italy -- was mostly based on national-level messages. 
In other words, Europe has been betrayed more by its political 
class than by its voters. 
  No doubt the fact that the European Parliament has limited 
powers only, and the fact that Europe's helplessness is 
highlighted daily by the tragic events in the former Yugoslavia, 
with the social consequences of a prolonged economic crisis, are 
all eminently valid arguments to explain electoral desertion. 
However, explanations do not end here. We must go deeper, 
delve into psychological introspection in the attempt to 
understand why Europeans are so distant from Europe, why 
disillusionment is today the most widespread feeling. 
  During the cold war years, the need for a strong and united 
West Europe was never called into question. Different 
institutional models -- more or less federal in nature, more or 
less intergovernmental -- may have been advanced. General de 
Gaulle and Mrs. Thatcher may have had different views. But 
nobody ever thought of rejecting Europe, particularly in the 
knowledge that friendly relations between France and Germany -- 
an unquestionable peace factor -- were essentially the outcome 
of the European integration process. 
  The first doubts were experienced in 1989. The fall of the 
Berlin Wall, Germany's reunification, the end of East-West 
ideological confrontation, the collapse of the Soviet empire, 
did not, in the view of Europeans, highlight the need for a 
united Europe or indeed the need to speed up the integration 
process. On the contrary, these events released 1,000 different 
poisons, not the least of which was nationalism. In today's 
Europe, as [outgoing EU Commission President] Jacques Delors 
correctly said, all the dangers of 1920 are present. We know 
very well how that story ended. 
  Nationalism is a form of short-sightedness and closed 
egoism. 
If Europe proves unable to rid itself of this demon, it cannot 
fail to arouse disappointment among its citizens. If politics 
continue to be interpreted exclusively in a national key, 
without the necessary openness and generosity, the little there 
is today of Europe will eventually dissolve into nothing. 
  It is the European Parliament -- the EU's weakest 
institution 
-- which is now footing the bill for this situation. But the new 
European deputies should not have their wings clipped simply 
because the polling booths were deserted. They must continue to 
fight against national governments' absolutism, against their 
tendency to drift off course by marginalizing and often 
criminalizing European power, whether in Brussels or Strasbourg. 
A victim of disillusionment, the European Parliament can 
nevertheless contribute to restoring the necessary climate of 
trust to further the integration process. 
  In this respect, the massive abstention from the European 
elections must be interpreted as a sort of last warning issued 
to the political class. Politicians must understand that Europe 
cannot be built amid indifference from Europeans -- no kind of 
Europe, neither the continental supermarket the British want, 
nor the EU advocated by Altiero Spinelli from the benches of the 
European Parliament.

<F P=106> [Letter from Marianne Jelved, Danish Minister of Economic </F>
Affairs: "Denmark More Than Just an `Ally' in Fight Against EU 
Fraud"] 
  [Text] Sir, I was pleased that the FT [FINANCIAL TIMES] 
showed interest in the serious problem that fraudulent use of 
Community funds constitutes with your article: "A labyrinth of 
loopholes" (May 19). As more and more resources are being 
administered through the Community budget, the potential scale 
of the fraud increases. The removal of internal frontiers with 
the creation of the Single Market also poses new challenges in 
the fight against fraud. 
  However, the article needs some correction. It says concern 
about fraud is most strongly felt in Germany, which has found 
allies in the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK. 
  In my opinion Denmark has been more than just an ally. 
Denmark has played a very active role in enhancing the focus on 
the war against EU [European Union] fraud. The protection of 
the financial interests of the Community was spelled out by the 
Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 when it asked the 
Commission to present a strategic programme for reinforcing the 
fight against fraud by March 3994. 
  In addition, the Danish government published a note, "The 
Community Budget and Fraud," before the Ecofin [Economic and 
Financial] council meeting in May this year. In this note we 
suggest important additional elements to the Commission's 
anti-fraud strategy. The note proposed speeding up member 
states' reaction to the Commission's requests for control 
visits; the use of as precise and targeted instruments as 
possible; and the development of systems to analyse the results 
of various anti-fraud activities. 
  In addition, the note proposed more publicity to fight 
against fraud; and use by member states of more common standards 
of control. The Commission's control and auditing teams should 
to a larger extent be able to draw on national audits in 
connection with EU control visits in member states. And it is 
necessary also to focus on the problem that the country where 
the fraud is committed is often not the same as the country of 
which the swindler is a resident. 
  The Danish attitude is not only governed by economic 
interest. Misuse of public funds runs counter to vital 
principles of openness and democratic control. The fight 
against fraud is thus of utmost importance for the image of the 
Community with our populations.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. IP/94/517: "The Information Society and </F>
Employment"] 
  [Text] "Diffusion of new technologies will contribute to 
job creation in Europe," said Commissioner Martin Bangemann at 
the European Information Technology Conference -- EITC '94 -- 
organised by the European Commission on 6-8 June in Brussels. 
  "What is the alternative?" -- asked Mr. Bangemann. "Either 
we grasp the opportunities before us and master the risks, or we 
bow to developments, together with all the disadvantages this 
may entail. If the European Union would be late using new 
technologies, we undoubtedly would lose competitiveness and 
destroy employment. Job creation will occur mainly in new 
services and in the `content' industries such as information 
services and audiovisual programme production. At the same 
time, this evolution will help preserve the diversity of 
European culture." 
  The 1994 European Information Technology conference 
coincided 
with two important events: The launch of the fourth framework 
programme for Community research and technological development 
and the announcement of the report on "Europe and the Global 
Information Society" by the high-level group chaired by 
Commissioner Bangemann. 
  "We must keep up the momentum," said the Commissioner. 
``Three specific actions are expected to be developed on the 
basis of this report during the German presidency: Accelerate 
the current deregulation of telecommunications; prepare 
necessary European regulations on domains such as intellectual 
property rights, privacy and security; and promote experimental 
applications. 
  ``We are in the midst of a revolution. In such a situation 
of discontinuity, the costs of inaction are higher than the 
costs of action. It is for this reason that I look to the 
European Council meeting in Corfu on 24 June, as the occasion 
where the necessary mechanisms for action should be set in 
motion. 
  ``Action means: Adapting existing policies to change. That 
is what we have done for the area of information technology in 
the 4th R&amp;D framework programme. And now we must follow a 
similar approach for other policies.''

<F P=106> [Report by Philip Stephens and John Willman: "Tories Dealt </F>
Fresh Blow in Euro-Poll"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major's government suffered another 
humiliating electoral blow early this morning as the first 
results of the European elections suggested the Conservatives' 
representation in the Strasbourg parliament would be at least 
halved. 
  The Labour party registered strong gains in its target seats 
in the Midlands and southern England. But the divided 
opposition to the Conservatives in the south appeared to have 
saved the government from the electoral "melt-down" predicted in 
some opinion polls. 
  The protest vote against Mr Major's administration left 
Labour celebrating early victories in the symbolically important 
seat of Essex South, which embraces the Westminster constituency 
of Basildon, and in most of its top target seats. Mr Jack 
Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, said that the 
results had re-established, the party as the only real 
challenger to the Conservatives across the country. 
  Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats won their first ever 
seat in the Strasbourg assembly, but the early signs were that 
their share of the vote had fallen substantially since last 
month's local elections. 
  On the basis of BBC projections after 22 results, the 
Conservatives would have 29 per cent of the vote, Labour 43 per 
cent and the Liberal Democrats only 15 per cent. Labour, 
confident of winning more than two-thirds of the 84 British 
seats in the Strasbourg assembly, claimed that the election 
outcome marked the beginning of the end of the Conservatives' 
15-year grip on power at Westminster. 
  Despite the Liberal Democrats win, the surge in support for 
the party earlier this year was checked in the European poll by 
the strong rise in the Labour vote in southern England. That in 
turn allowed the Conservatives to retain control of some of its 
vulnerable seats. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat 
leader, acknowledged the shift with the comment that "Labour has 
saved the Tories." 
  Among the clutch of other early results the Conservatives 
held on to Wight and Hampshire South, one of the Liberal 
Democrats target seats. But it lost Somerset to the Liberal 
Democrats and Northants and Blaby, Norfolk and Leicester to 
Labour. 
  Earlier, even before the votes were counted, sharp divisions 
in the Conservative party over Europe and Mr Major's leadership 
re-emerged as the government braced itself for the anticipated 
defeat. 
  Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, signalled the start of a 
concerted cabinet operation to shore up Mr Major's premiership. 
Mr Hurd, who defended Mr Major's strategy in the European 
campaign, said it would be "absolutely crazy" for the 
Conservatives to think about changing leader for the second time 
in four years. He told BBC Radio: "We have someone whom I 
believe to be an excellent prime minister." 
  That view was echoed by Sir Norman Fowler, the party 
chairman, and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, as 
the cabinet prepared for a backlash from disgruntled MPs when 
they return to Westminster tomorrow after the Whitsun recess. 
  Characterising the European elections as the low point in 
the 
government's fortunes, Sir Norman held out the prospect that 
strengthening economic recovery would pave the way for tax cuts 
well before the general election due by mid-1997. 
  But hopes that the party's warring factions would maintain 
the fragile truce which held during the European campaign were 
shattered by outspoken criticism of Mr Major from both the right 
and left. 
  From the right the prime minister faced calls for a radical 
reshaping of the government's domestic policies combined with a 
toughening of the sceptical approach to Europe which featured in 
the campaign. 
  But pro-Europeans, in a warning that Mr Major would depend 
crucially on their support if he was challenged for the 
leadership, said he must stop "appeasing" the Tory Euro-sceptics.

<F P=106> [Report by Donald Macintyre and Colin Brown: "Tories Demand </F>
Tax Cut Lifeline"] 
  [Text] John Major yesterday held out the prospect of a 
wide-ranging Cabinet reshufffle next month as ministerial 
pressure mounted on him to bring forward tax cuts in the wake of 
the Tories' worst electoral performance this century. 
  The Prime Minister confronted his critics with a warning 
that 
he stood ready to "beat" any challenge to his leadership and 
that he would "stick to" existing policies despite a European 
election defeat which left the Tories with just 27.8 per cent of 
the popular vote. 
  Mr Major, who confirmed yesterday that there would be a 
reshuffle "not this week, not next week, but not never," has 
told close colleagues that it will be more than "mere tinkering" 
-- implying the dismissal as well as the transfer of some 
Cabinet ministers. 
  His firm declaration that he intended to fight the next 
general election as party leader, and on existing policies, came 
amid signs of an imminent and intense debate within the party 
over the desirability of early tax cuts to win back the support 
of defecting voters. Some ministers are expected to press for 
the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, to reconsider the second-stage 
increase in VAT on domestic fuel to 17.5 per cent next April, 
partly on the grounds that the gathering recovery will make the 
2bn pounds revenue gain from the rise less necessary. 
  In a marked departure of style, Mr Major chose to give his 
first public reaction to the Tories' drubbing in the European 
Parliament elections in the garden at No. 10 Downing Street at 
what he said would be the first of a series of ad hoc and 
on-the-record press conferences for political reporters. 
  His move came as a jubilant Labour Party celebrated gains in 
Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Hertfordshire and Kent which Jack 
Cunningham, Labour's shadow Foreign Secretary, said were a 
"watershed." He added: "Labour has won in areas where we 
haven't been successful since the 1960s and in some cases even 
farther back than that." 
  After clear hints of pre-general election tax cuts from Sir 
Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, following last week's 
by-election defeats, Mr Major reaffirmed he would "rather let 
people decide for themselves how to spend their money than we 
should decide on their behalf." 
  But he was guarded on the timing, adding: "If and when it is 
prudent to cut taxes in the future, our instinct will be to cut 
them." He was echoed last night on Channel 4 News by Mr Clarke, 
who said: "Taxation will come down when we can afford to lower 
taxation." 
  But in the most significant reaction to the election results 
from the right wing of the Cabinet, John Redwood, Secretary of 
State for Wales, acknowledged that Labour had had a "good night" 
and that its policy of criticising the Government had "paid off 
in the short term." 
  Mr Redwood added: "The Government needs to listen. People 
want a continuing recovery, which we intend to deliver and they 
want lower taxes which only the Conservatives wish to deliver 
when circumstances allow." 
  Although Mr Redwood's reaction scrupulously conformed with 
the letter of government policy, it will strike a chord with 
senior backbenchers such as Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 
Committee, who also stressed the importance of tax cuts, adding: 
"Let me just make this absolutely clear. John Major is our 
Prime Minister and he will remain so." 
  Asked if he foresaw a leadership challenge, Mr Major said: 
"I am still here. We have a mechanism if people wish to 
challenge in the autumn -- that's a matter for them. I don't 
expect one. I will be here waiting for it if there is one. I 
will beat it and I will be here through the general election." 
  Some advisers are urging Mr Major to appoint Michael 
Heseltine as chairman in the reshuffle -- a move designed to 
raise party morale and make it more difficult for the President 
of the Board of Trade to remain a potential contender for the 
leadership. 
  The Liberal Democrats declared themselves highly satisfied 
with winning their first two European seats -- in Somerset and 
Cornwall-- and Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, in an 
Independent article today, affirms that "the electorate remains 
stubbornly three-dimensional." 
  The one setback to an otherwise resounding victory for 
Labour 
yesterday was the capture by the Scottish Nationalist Party 
[SNP] of the seat for North East Scotland. The SNP secured a 
record share of 33 per cent of the Scottish vote. And in 
another significant result John Hume, the Social and Democratic 
and Labour Party candidate, saw his vote rise in the three 
member Northern Ireland seat from 136,000 to almost 162,000 
almost overtaking Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party MEP 
[member of European Parliament].

<F P=106> [Article by Kenneth Baker, MP and former Conservative Party </F>
chairman: "United Front Tories Must Now Give to Their Leader"] 
  [Text] One of the abiding lessons of British political 
history is that a party which is divided will be defeated. Once 
the perception of division gets around, it is extremely 
difficult to shake off. 
  The Conservative Party must shake it off. 
  Every party has a variety of views over Europe but, if we go 
on parading them as a great doctrinal divide, then we will go 
down the road to defeat. So a period of silence from the two 
extremes of Tony Marlow on the Right and Hugh Dykes on the Left 
would be welcome. 
  John Major laid down the line for the Tory Party very firmly 
-- and the party must unite behind him. 
  He wants to see a multi-layered, multi-track, multi-speed 
Europe. This is not only right, it's popular. That view was 
expressed in ballot boxes all over Europe. 
  John Major campaigned well and deserved a much better 
result. 
  In my own constituency in Surrey, the Liberals boasted of a 
landslide. But we found on the doorstep that John Major's 
speech had gone down well. We also found that people were fed 
up with tax increases. Ken Clarke, please note. 
  What his speech expressed was the positive approach to 
Europe, not the centralist dream of Delors of the all-powerful, 
bureaucratic and interfering government from Brussels and 
Strasbourg. The new Europe will be a looser association of 
nation states. This is not anti-Europe, it is pro-Europe 
realism. 
  It is now up to the Government to put flesh on these bones. 
It has the chance to do this in preparing for the 
Inter-Governmental Conference in 1996. 
  Our approach must be to contain the powers of the European 
Commission, to resist further qualified majority voting; and not 
to allow any more powers to be transferred from Westminster to 
Strasbourg. 
  The multi-layered approach is the heart of subsidiarity. 
That's the winning ticket. 
  The ultra pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party must not 
challenge that approach. I hope that Ted Heath will not divide 
the Tory Party by campaigning against John Major. 
  When he became leader he received the support of Alec Home 
and Harold Macmillan. More recently, Neil Kinnock fully 
supported John Smith. It is the job of the elder statesman to 
support the party leader. 
  The party that is in trouble over Europe is Labour. One of 
its successful candidates was crowing on television that the 
Strasbourg Parliament would make Westminster virtually 
redundant, a minor county council at the best. 
  That, of course, is what Euro-socialism is all about. But 
that is not in tune with the mood of the country. 
  The reason why the Liberal Democrats did so badly is that 
people had come to realise they wanted to surrender everything 
to Europe. 
  They didn't win the Euroseats in which their famed 
by-election victories of Christchurch, Eastleigh and Newbury are 
situated. Those Westminster seats will come back to the 
Conservatives at the next General Election. 
  The Liberal-Democrats' most bitter disappointment was not to 
win their target seat on the Welsh border of Hereford and 
Shropshire. There it was Labour that turned out the 
Conservatives. 
  Mr Ashdown knows that from now on it is downhill all the way 
for his party. He has to worry most about Tony Blair because 
Blair is a younger, more intelligent version of himself. Blair 
will go fishing in Liberal Democrat waters. 
  So what are the Conservatives going to do? 
  First there must be no question of dropping the pilot. John 
Major should and will remain the leader of the Conservative 
Party. 
  He has shown a certain dour resilience which is the most 
important quality to see a ship through a heavy storm. 
  If the Conservative Party went into a contested leadership 
contest, it would tear itself apart. 
  John Major must lay down the party line more clearly and 
crisply, exactly as he has done in the Euro-elections. It's up 
to the party to accept it and back him. 
  He doesn't need to have a General Election until April 1997, 
which is nearly three years away. That is a very long time in 
politics. 
  During that time, the Liberal-Democrats will prattle and the 
Labour Party will rattle. 
  They will be rattled over taxes, rattled over Europe and 
rattled over the reform of the Welfare State. Mr Blair is going 
to have to spell out his party's concrete policies for all of 
these issues. 
  At the moment, Labour's support is boosted by the 
unpopularity of the Government and the vacuum of Labour's own 
policies. 
  You do not win General Elections with a vacuum.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Backing Brittan"] </F>
  [Text] During Jacques Delors's long tenure of the European 
Commissions presidency, that office has become vastly more 
important to the daily lives of 340 million Europeans. It is 
therefore of utmost importance that his successor has a vision 
of Europe in tune with the post-Maastricht mood of its 
inhabitants. 
  The two leading contenders are Jean-Luc Dehaene, Prime 
Minister of Belgium, and Ruud Lubbers, former Prime Minister of 
The Netherlands. The contest has become more than just a 
question of competence, personality and political weight: it is 
now seen as the weathervane of the European Union's [EU] future 
direction. But the chances of agreement being reached by the 12 
heads of government at their forthcoming meeting in Corfu are 
not good. 
  To Britain's dismay, Mr Dehaene has been the favourite. 
Arguments claimed in his favour include his record of 
competence during last year's Belgian EU presidency, an ability 
to compromise, an outlook relatively free of socialist 
dogmatism. But he is also a federalist of the old order. Being 
Belgian, he will find it hard to distance himself from the 
Establishment of Brussels, and is ill-placed to respond to 
demands for regionalism, subsidiarity and a cutback in 
interference by unelected bureaucrats. Above all, he is the 
candidate that France and Germany have attempted to impose by 
diktat. 
  France has an unreasonable desire for another French-speaker 
at the head of the Commission at a time when it sees four 
naturally anglophone members are about to join; Helmut Kohl has 
turned against Mr Lubbers for no better reason than personal 
dislike. Even if Mr Delors's successor must be chosen by secret 
manoeuvring rather than open ballot, this degree of manipulation 
should not be accepted. Even more insulting is the open talk of 
compensation jobs -- not in any European leaders gift -- for 
defeated aspirants. 
  Mr Lubbers is better qualified for the job than Mr Dehaene. 
Support for him may prevent the immediate imposition of Mr 
Dehaene at Corfu. But it will probably lead only to stalemate. 
Of the other candidates, Peter Sutherland, a forceful former 
Irish Commissioner, has attracted considerable support. But Sir 
Leon Brittan, the EU Trade Commissioner, is without doubt the 
best qualified prospective successor to Mr Delors. A French 
speaker, a superb negotiator -- a GaTT treaty would have been 
impossible without him -- and a skilful diplomat who has 
re-established relations with southern countries upset by his 
firmness as former Competition Commissioner, he combines the 
liberal free trade ideas with commitment to a Europe that is 
open and decentralised. 
  Given the Prime Minister's reputation in Europe and the 
fiasco of Britain's performance over voting rights, British 
support for Sir Leon will not be enough. It is therefore up to 
other countries to recognise that he would best take Europe in 
the direction most of their voters want. The French have a 
critical role here; their divided government must ask itself how 
much it really want a president as federalist as Mr Dehaene. 
Though the tide in the European Community remains unfavourable 
for antifederalists, no opportunity to shift it a little nearer 
to thinking which could be embraced by French Gaullistes no less 
than British Euro-sceptics should be squandered.

  [Text] Bonn, June 14 -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel voiced his support on Tuesday [14 June] for Poland's 
motion to join the European Union (EU). 
  During his talk with Chairman of the Social Democracy of the 
Republic of Poland (SDRP) Aleksander Kwasniewski, now on a visit 
to Germany at the invitation from the German Association for 
Foreign Policy (DGAP), Kinkel stressed that Poland had to 
fulfill particular economic conditions. 
  The German foreign minister also emphasized the necessity to 
improve "membership abilities" in key fields and added that this 
also concerned other candidates. Kinkel promised Germany would 
deal with this problem during its chairmanship in the union, to 
start on July 1, 1994. 
  Kinkel approved of Poland's "fast and open" attitude towards 
the Partnership for Peace programme, saying that the partnership 
would change relations between the countries participating in 
the initiative and NATO. 
  Next, the foreign minister stressed Germany's readiness to 
support Poland in building market economy and pluralistic 
structures. 
  Also on Tuesday, Kwasniewski met with former German Foreign 
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President of the Bundestag Rita 
Suessmuth, Minister of Defence Volker Ruehe, Minister of 
Economics Guenter Rexrodt, head of the Free Democratic Party 
(FDP) faction Herman Otto Solms and deputies of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and of the Christian 
Democratic Party (CDU) Markus Meckel and Friedbert Pflueger, 
respectively. 
  The SDRP leader briefed the German politicians on the 
political and economic situation in Poland, emphasizing the 
consistency in implementing reforms. He also added that a 
greater stress on the social aspects did not mean the easing of 
the budget requirements and the weakening of anti-inflationary 
measures. Kwasniewski also said EU markets should open to 
Polish products. 
  The German defence minister confirmed his support for 
Poland's membership of NATO around the year 2000. He also 
stressed the significance of contacts between the German and the 
Polish armies for bringing Poland closer to Western defence 
structures.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
called on the union members and the shop stewards to advocate 
more part-time jobs in Germany. In Berlin on Tuesday [14 June], 
Kohl told the 15th Regular Federal Congress of the German Trade 
Union Federation (DGB) that this is a contribution to the 
reduction of unemployment. 
  The chancellor stressed that changing one's way of thinking 
continues to be the dictate of reason. The greatest challenge 
is securing existing jobs and creating new ones. 
  Kohl paid tribute to late DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer, 
calling him a "great patriot." At the same time, he offered the 
new DGB chairman "talks in the near future." The DGB congress 
will elect a new chairman on Tuesday afternoon. The only 
candidate is Metal Union Executive Committee member Dieter 
Schulte. 
  The 600 DGB delegates received Kohl with some hooting and 
booing, but also with applause. Labor Minister Norbert Bluem, 
who accompanied Kohl, was clearly hooted and booed at. 
  The chancellor expressed his conviction "that we will solve 
the social and economic problems in the new laender." He 
admitted that the adjustment of living conditions will take some 
years longer than he had expected. "I demand a clear priority 
regulation for investments in the new laender," even if there 
are problems in the west, the Christian Democratic Union 
chairman said. 
  Despite the incipient upswing, Kohl thinks Germany's 
problems 
as a business location have not been solved. The efforts to 
secure one's economic power must not slacken off, he said.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- Dieter Schulte, new chairman of the 
German Trade Union Federation [DGB], has outlined the trade 
unions' future policy. In his inaugural speech at the 15th DGB 
Federal Congress in Berlin, Schulte said the trade unions will 
press full steam ahead for social justice and social unity. 
Before the 600 delegates, he called at the same time for using 
reform to strengthen the DGB and its trade unions. 
  Schulte emphatically advocated long-term state-promoted 
employment in eastern and western Germany. It must be paid 
according to the wage scale, keeping to the principle of same 
wage for same work. He called mass unemployment the malignant 
tumor of industrial society. The nascent economic upswing 
cannot obscure the fact that there is a gulf between growth and 
employment, he said. 
  According to Schulte, the DGB and its individual unions also 
want to struggle for Germany as an example of democracy and 
tolerance. Extreme-right provocateurs and arsonists must not 
have a chance, he said. 
  In the afternoon, Christian Social Union Chairman Theo 
Waigel 
and Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens want to 
address the delegates.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Italian Forces Ready, </F>
Defence Minister Say"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Taranto, June 10 -- Italian troops are ready 
to leave for Rwanda, "as on other occasions," if the situation 
is clarified internationally and a programme for a peace 
intervention is drawn up, Italian Defence Minister Cesare 
Previti pledged here today. 
  Speaking at ceremonies and events for Navy Day, he said the 
UN had so far not approached Italy on the timing or modalities 
of an Italian contribution. "The only request we have received 
so far is for a C-130 transport plane, which we sent at once," 
he reported. 
  According to Previti, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino is 
pursuing policies whereby there will be a greater Italian 
involvement in peace operations. "Naturally," he added, "they 
could never be unilateral or fail to take account of the 
international context in which they are being promoted." 
  Previti also recalled that, at the Group of Seven summit in 
Naples, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will be proposing a UN 
task force for humanitarian missions such as those needed in 
situations such as Rwanda's. 
  "The idea is to rationalise the possible forms of 
humanitarian intervention the world can make in the most 
tortured situations of war and calamity," he asserted. 
  In other points, in his official speech and a later press 
conference, Previti said he would be trying to reverse the past 
trend towards defence cuts, saying the objective remains to 
modernise and re-shape the armed forces on the principle of 
"more quality, less quantity." 
  "The Cold War is over," he said, adding that the use of the 
Italian armed forces must now be only a "function of the 
country's international presence." 
  Previti also said military service would be reduced in 
favour 
of an increase in the number of volunteer servicemen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Refugees Receive </F>
Hospital Treatment, RPF Representative in Rome"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- A representative of the 
Rwandan Popular Front (RPF) flew into Rome Wednesday [8 June] to 
thank the Italian Government for bringing out 93 severely 
wounded refugees, and to urge further aid for his country. 
  The representative of the opposition group, Jacques 
Bihozagara, was met at the airport by Maria Pia Fanfani, 
president of the Insieme per la Pace (Together for Peace) 
organisation which managed to get the refugees, which included 
75 orphaned children and the Rwandan national soccer team, out 
of the war-torn country. 
  Bihozagara said he was in Rome "to thank the Italian 
Government and people, which have already done so much for 
Rwanda, but also to explain the situation in my country, and the 
need to get medicines, healthcare aid and food as soon as 
possible." 
  Fanfani said that her organisation was working with the 
Italian Government on plans to send aid ships to Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino </F>
by Robert Graham; place and date not given: "Sceptic With a 
Hint of Enthusiasm"] 
  [Text] It is a curious irony that the first European 
government to be headed by a media magnate should have an image 
problem. But the month-old Italian Government of Silvio 
Berlusconi is struggling to shrug off the negative international 
impact of containing five ministers from the neo-fascist MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]/National Alliance. 
  Much of the flak falls on the shoulders of Antonio Martino, 
the free-market economist and political novice who has taken 
over as foreign minister. 
  "We made a mistake in not paying sufficient attention to the 
foreign press (during the election campaign)," Mr Martino 
concedes. 
  Having just spent much of Monday [6 June] fielding queries 
on 
hostile comments made against the MSI by Mr Jacques Delors, 
president of the EU [European Union] Commission, and an Israeli 
junior minister, Mr Martino is remarkably sanguine. 
  He attributes the attacks on the neo-fascists to attempts by 
European socialists to score points in the run-up to this 
weekend's European elections. "We are in a pre-electoral 
atmosphere," he says. "After Monday, things should begin to 
quiet down." 
  Though feeling his way and distracted by having to convince 
Italy's international partners of the government's democratic 
credentials, Mr Martino clearly relishes the opportunity to put 
his ideas into practice. He is an economist trained in Chicago 
under Milton Friedman, who caught Mr Berlusconi's eye writing 
opinionated free market articles some 18 months ago. Right 
until the end of the campaign for the March general elections, 
he was Mr Berlusconi's economic adviser and looked set to be the 
next treasury minister. 
  Nevertheless, diplomacy runs in the blood. His father, 
Gaetano, was the Christian Democrat foreign minister who signed 
the articles of the Treaty of Rome, while his cousin, Ferdinando 
Salleo, is a career diplomat. 
  Mr Martino is the first Italian foreign minister since the 
Treaty of Rome to question the European ideal. It would be 
surprising if his forthright views do not shape new Italian 
policies towards the Union. 
  "In Italy I'm considered a Euro-sceptic; but in Britain I 
would probably be considered a Euro-enthusiast," he says of his 
membership of the Thatcher-inspired Bruges Group. A convinced 
Anglophile, married to an American, he champions a more 
pragmatic approach to the consolidation of the EU. "The 
Maastricht Treaty is not a bible." 
  Mr Martino is also critical of the Euro-socialist thinking 
behind the social chapter. "It may be motivated by lofty ideals 
but it produces some perverse results." He attributes Italy's 
high unemployment directly to unnecessary rigidities in the 
labour market, although the hire and fire laws were intended to 
protect the workers. 
  Yet he is by no means anti-EU: rather he is deeply critical 
of the unquestioning pro-Europeanism of previous Italian 
governments. "Italy said yes to everything but then was not 
necessarily able to implement," he says, citing Italy's 
inability to comply with milk quotas. 
  He dislikes the dirigiste aspect of Brussels. Governments, 
he says, should be free to determine their own regulations to 
avoid the kind of bruising national arguments over the 
`Euro-sausage' or `convergent size of condoms'. 
  "In the EU we have created institutions without strategies 
(for their use). ... It's like buying a computer without 
knowing how to use it. First you must choose the software, then 
the hardware.... If we believe in Europe we have to ask why." 
  Europe, he insists, must be demonstrably for the public 
good. 
He sees five elements of common benefit -- the single market, a 
common currency, a common foreign policy, a common defence 
policy, and the need for a genuine court of appeal/ombudsman to 
which citizens can resort. 
  He supports the single market but warns it must be able to 
make guarantees against protectionism among individual members. 
On the advantages of a common currency he is more sceptical. 
  "If -- and it is a big if -- I can have guarantees that the 
common currency will not be mismanaged, then I'm in favour." The 
common currency would be beneficial, he claims, because it would 
reduce the cost of transactions, help stabilise international 
currency markets and be an alternative to the dollar, while also 
acting as a symbol of European unity. 
  "A common currency is desirable although it is not 
absolutely 
essential for the single market.... It requires an indivisible 
solution -- ie: it cannot be done step by step." 
  On a common European foreign policy, Mr Martino is wary of 
forming axes within Europe such as that between France and 
Germany. An axis means a return to "conventional diplomacy with 
favoured partners." To counter the latest moves by France and 
Germany towards tightening their co-operation, he is aware Italy 
might be tempted to make common cause with the UK and Spain. 
  The first test of Italy's Eurodiplomacy will be the 
forthcoming choice of a successor for Mr Delors. Instinctively 
Mr Martino would prefer Sir Leon Brittan, the trade 
commissioner, or Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish candidate and 
GATT head. Such figures, or a compromise candidate, are needed 
to embody a new post-Maastricht approach to union. But the 
Italian Government has yet to make up its mind. 
  Italy, Mr Martino says, should be more prepared to be more 
opinionated on a range of issues. "One should say exactly what 
one feels about policy. In this I admire Mrs Thatcher, even if 
she may have overdone it on occasions." 
  This underscores the desire of Mr Martino -- and that of Mr 
Berlusconi -- to raise Italy's international profile. One 
problem here is that Italy, despite its size and membership of 
Nato, has poorly equipped armed forces. Successive governments 
when looking for spending cuts always turned to the defence 
budget, he laments. 
  "The Defence Ministry now spends less than the regional 
government of Sicily," he observes. If Italy is to play a 
bigger international role, it must have the military means -- 
"but I don't want to sound militaristic." 
  He is bitter at the way Italy has been left to play second 
fiddle over events in the neighbouring states of former 
Yugoslavia. Italy has been excluded from the contact group 
formed between the United States, Russia and the EU. "We cannot 
be answerable for decisions to which we are not a party," he 
says. 
  Behind this treatment of Italy lies a complex debate over 
whether troops should be sent to ex-Yugoslavia. Mr Martino lays 
down four conditions for this to happen: a peace plan must be 
accepted by all interested parties; this peace plan must be 
backed by the United Nations; the UN must request Italian 
troops; and the troops should then be under NATO command. 
  In all his answers, Mr Martino behaves as if he is master in 
his own house. "I think Berlusconi shares some of my 
Euro-scepticism. He trusts me and expects me to take care of 
this area of policy. As a businessman he is accustomed to the 
idea of delegating responsibility."

<F P=106> [Interview with Gianfranco Fini, chairman of the Italian </F>
Social Movement, by Daniela Horvath and Teja Fiedler; place and 
date not given: "Mussolini Was Not a Criminal"] 
  [Text] [STERN] Mr. Fini, is Benito Mussolini still the 
greatest Italian statesmen of this century for you? 
  [Fini] I never used this formulation. I said: Mussolini is 
one of the men in Italy who embody this century best. 
  [STERN] Your present formulation is not precisely reserved. 
Was the Duce a great politician or a bad dictator? 
  [Fini] Until 1938, until he put his signature on the racial 
laws and his alliance with Hitler, fascism in Italy met with 
broad agreement. Afterward, it was finished. What came 
afterward was totalitarianism. 
  [STERN] Mussolini attacked Ethiopia and Albania even before 
the "steel pact" with Hitler. 
  [Fini] At that time, other countries, for example, Great 
Britain, were as imperialist as Italy. Today, however, there is 
no longer room for it: neither for colonialism nor for 
totalitarianism. 
  [STERN] The hawks in your party, however, have not yet 
bidden farewell to classic fascism. 
  [Fini] These people are wrong. Fascism is no longer 
up-to-date today. 
  [STERN] It is not only in Italy that one gets the impression 
that its ideals are absolutely popular again. 
  [Fini] What is still valid are lasting values, such as the 
defense of the family and the love of one's country. 
  [STERN] And the idea of the social state of solidarity, 
which is allegedly supposed to take care of the poor? 
  [Fini] That, too, of course. 
  [STERN] These values are to be translated into reality arm 
in arm with head of government Berlusconi of all people, an 
industrial magnate who controls the course of tough economic 
liberalism? 
  [Fini] We are not against the free market economy. What we 
want is a social market economy like in Germany. 
  [STERN] The first thing that your government partner 
Berlusconi proposed was to cut pensions and to introduce lower 
wages in the Mezzogiorno, the anyway poor south of Italy, where 
your party got the most votes. 
  [Fini] As long as we are in the government, there will be no 
wages that are graduated according to regions. 
  [STERN] Your party friend and deputy head of government, 
Giuseppe Tatarella, said it quite clearly the other day: I am 
not a fascist. When will we finally hear this sentence from you? 
  [Fini] I see myself as a postfascist. 
  [STERN] What may we understand by that? 
  [Fini] This is quite simple: I have surpassed fascism, this 
ideology is no longer necessary. 
  [STERN] At any rate, you stated recently in an interview in 
a good fascist tradition that the question of the border with 
Slovenia and Croatia is still "open" for you. When do you 
intend to annex the Istrian peninsula? 
  [Fini] You should not only read the leftist press, which 
constantly quotes me incorrectly: For me there has never been a 
border problem. What we are interested in is the adequate 
protection of the Italian minority. 
  [STERN] That is to say, the borders are inviolable for you? 
  [Fini] Borders are never immovable, but if this is done, 
then only by negotiations, in our opinion. 
  [STERN] When did you actually discover the moderate fascist 
in yourself? 
  [Fini] When communism broke down in Europe with the fall of 
the Berlin Wall in 1989. Many people of my generation only 
became fascists -- in quotation marks -- because communism 
threatened our freedom. 
  [STERN] Not all members of your party seem to have taken 
part in this change. For example, the Italian Social Movement 
in Venice had a mass said in honor of Mussolini. And in the 
party organ of your party, SECOLO D'ITALIA, an article that puts 
homosexuality on the same level with rape, incest, and sodomy is 
being published now. 
  [Fini] Wait a moment: This was not an article by the 
editorial staff, but the polemic pleading of a guest author... 
  [STERN] ...which your paper printed in full without 
dissociating itself from it. 
  [Fini] Our party line on the topic of homosexuality is 
clear: Everyone can do with his body what he wants, as long as 
he does it in his private sphere. But it is also clear that 
homosexuality is not normal. 
  [STERN] And the memorial service for Mussolini? 
  [Fini] A memorial service for the dead is not an attack on 
democracy. 
  [STERN] If a mass were said today in honor of Adolf Hitler, 
the world would be topsy-turvy. 
  [Fini] After all, Hitler was a criminal. 
  [STERN] And the Duce? 
  [Fini] It was Mussolini's greatest error to get involved 
with Hitler. However, the difference is that there is hardly 
anyone in your country who grieves for Hitler today, while many 
Italians are still convinced today that Mussolini achieved a lot 
of good things. At any rate, he was not a criminal. 
  [STERN] What about the racial laws, the prosecution of 
political opponents? 
  [Fini] The racial laws were also a tragic error of 
Mussolini. 
  [STERN] Why did you, as the strong man of your party, not 
become a member of the government? 
  [Fini] For the time being, I want to take care of the party 
and explain our attitude toward fascism today to the world. 
  [STERN] Why do you not start in Bologna, where your European 
candidate Piero Buscaroli suggested internment camps for 
homosexuals? 
  [Fini] I do not believe that he said such a thing. 
Buscaroli is one of the most important musicologists in Italy. 
Hence, music and camps -- they do not go together. 
  [STERN] The concentration camp commanders liked to have 
Wagner and Beethoven played to them by the prisoners' orchestras. 
  [Fini] Wagner, but certainly not Rossini. 
  [STERN] You are not trusted abroad: Your ministers are 
booed at, people refuse to shake hands with them -- like in 
Belgium. Statesmen like Francois Mitterrand or newly elected FRG 
President Roman Herzog are warning against a right-wing 
development like in Italy. Is the Waldheim effect, Italy's 
isolation, imminent? 
  [Fini] The whole thing is a campaign before the European 
elections that is directed by the European left. 
  [STERN] Herzog is really not suspected of left-wing ideas. 
  [Fini] Your president certainly talks and acts with the best 
of intentions, but he clearly fell into the trap set by European 
socialists like Mitterrand or Papandreou; they are afraid that 
the right will win everywhere in the European election.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Justice Minister on Justice </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- The prospect of extending 
plea bargaining to help dismantle the backlog of business and 
political corruption cases, overcrowded prisons and the 
management of organized crime figures who have turned state's 
witnesses were the key issues discussed here by Justice Minister 
Alfredo Biondi in his first address to the full assembly of the 
Supreme Council of Magistrates (CSM). 
  On state's witnesses, the new minister stressed the need to 
strengthen the area of the law covering "the objective 
verification of their accusations aimed at guaranteeing (their) 
total reliability and, at the same time, avoiding tampering and 
discrediting." 
  For this purpose, Biondi reported to the self-ruling body of 
the nation's judiciary that in cooperation with the Interior 
Ministry, a panel had been formed for work on "judiciary 
initiatives necessary so that state's witnesses know the 
consequences they are facing" if their testimony sidetracks 
investigations or is slanderous. 
  In this connection, the minister said he intends to return 
to 
the Parliament a bill submitted to the Senate during the 
legislature just past for enhancing the defense of defendants 
facing criminal charges. This package includes new measures on 
the application of preventive custody and the use of the 
advisory warrant, sent out to formally notify the recipient that 
he or she is under investigation. 
  The minister said he would like to avoid having the advisory 
warrant, "an essential judiciary safeguard instrument, become a 
source of serious prejudice against the person investigated." 
  On the sensitive issue of attacking the mountain of pending 
corruption trials, without applying coats of whitewash, Biondi 
said, "The solution studied by my ministry is not a political 
solution, it is judiciary. This is a matter merely of expanding 
the concept of plea bargaining already provided for in our laws 
and already proposed by my predecessor, Giovanni Conso, in the 
preceding legislature." 
  He explained that the measures under examination would be 
applied strictly at the time of trial and that plea bargaining 
would be available to all defendants, not only the politicians 
facing trial. "So, there would be no unequal treatment and no 
requests of constitutional illegitimacy." 
  He said he had addressed himself to this issue in his 
statement to the CSM "to calm those who have shown worry about 
possible disparity of treatment of people." 
  Moving on to what he said was of special concern to him, the 
new minister cited "excessive overcrowding in the prisons" in 
the nation with a prison population of some 56,000 in facilities 
designed to accommodate 30,000 prisoners. 
  "The steep increase in the number of detainees is a complex 
phenomenon," he said and confirmed that it would be difficult to 
imagine a "spontaneous reversal of the trend" in the near 
future. "It is necessary, therefore, to act to curb this process 
and to make the structures of the penitentiaries administration 
adequate," he declared. 
  He also disclosed the government is weighing such steps as 
"extending the application of measures on the expulsion of 
foreign nationals" and replacing "detention in prison with 
alternative punishment for minor crimes" and for short terms 
remaining of sentences which have been almost completely served. 
  Biondi told the magistrates he intends to "strongly raise" 
in 
the cabinet the matter of a bigger budget for justice and will 
devote careful attention to the administration of civil justice. 
In this connection, he recalled that the colossal backlog of 
civil cases wending their slow ways through the courts has led 
to serious problems for Italy before the European Commission and 
the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. 
  Before the introduction of two changes pending, adding a new 
sector made up of justice of the peace and a revised civil law 
code, the minister said he intends to confer on the real 
prospects for the application of these reforms. For this 
purpose, he reported he will meet tomorrow with the National 
Association of Magistrates and the National Forensic Council. 
  He also promised to carefully assess recommendations 
recently 
drafted by the CSM on the elimination of a number of "useless" 
offices within the nation's judiciary.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Finances Better Than </F>
Government Forecasts"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Italy's public-sector deficit 
should have improved by the end of 1994 to the tune of about 5-7 
trillion lire, or 3-4.5 billion dollars compared to government 
forecasts earlier this year, Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry], the Italian business 
association said here today. 
  The association's bulletin of the latest economic 
information, CONGIUNTURA FLASH, said that a reconsideration of 
the parameters used by the Treasury recently shows a public 
sector borrowing requirement of 75.4 trillion lire in the first 
five months of the year, compared to 87.8 trillion in the same 
period last year. 
  As Industry Minister Vito Gnutti told a meeting of Roman 
Confindustria members that the Berlusconi government had 
inherited a "dramatic" situation from previous governments, 
Confindustria said a condition for turning in the better than 
forecast results was that controls on expenditure should remain 
severe. 
  According to Confindustria, the government's forecast of a 
10-trillion-lire fall in the tax take due to growth of only 1.3 
percent in gross domestic product should be scotched by events 
since growth should be more sustained and produce a tax take 
take 3-4 trillion lire higher than the government expected. 
  The analysis suggested that a few trillion lire in savings 
might also be achieved despite the costs of getting the 
railways, EFIM [Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial 
Company] and similar situations back onto track. According to 
Confindustria, these could be offset by revenue from 
privatisation. 
  The analysis suggested that savings on interest payments 
thanks to lower rates could rise as high as 30 trillion lire, 
with further advantages accruing in 1995. According to 
Confindustria, the official forecast of a deficit of 180 
trillion lire in 1995 would in fact leave space for a 
"significant increase in public expenditure." 
  Confindustria pointed out that international organisations 
are currently upgrading their economic growth forecasts, with 
Italy moving into economic recovery "with some uncertainty." 
  The analysis said that industrial production rose by 1.3 
percent in April, but fell again by 1.1 percent in May. Foreign 
demand remained strong, and domestic demand is showing signs of 
new life. But inflation was stuck at 4.1 percent, rather than 
falling further as expected. 
  Gnutti charged that governments of the last five years had 
failed to keep their promises as regards reining in the public 
deficit. He also claimed that the penalty for failing to make 
radical change in the way the economy is run would be to leave 
the European "area of competition and growth...for a model of 
underdevelopment." 
  He also argued against what he described as "still-born" 
investments, citing the EFIM debacle which he said had run up a 
consolidated debt of 20 trillion lire for 30,000 employees, 
giving a final loss of 600 million lire per employee. According 
to Gnutti, a large part of the public debt of 2,000 trillion 
lire consists of "so many EFIMs." 
  Confindustria Chairman Luigi Abete told the meeting that 
Italy's economic strategy must be based on: 
internationalisation, with a long look at emerging countries 
such as India and China; fiscal modernisation since the issue of 
growth and tax equity must be resolved together; and a market in 
which the rules are stronger and the lead actors stronger thanks 
to improved capitalisation. 
  He also urged rapid privatisation as a form of value added 
to 
competitivity.

<F P=106> [Article signed FZ/PI: "12 June Federal Polls: 57.3 </F>
Percent Against Swiss Blue Helmets -- Supporters Say an 
Opportunity Has Been Missed"] 
  [Text] Bern, 12 Jun (ATS) -- Switzerland will not have its 
own blue helmets. The people have rejected, by a 57.3-percent 
majority, the creation of a Swiss contingent for UN peacekeeping 
operations. The opponents, surprised by the widespread 
rejection, are happy that Switzerland's neutrality remains 
unaffected. For the supporters of the project, Switzerland has 
missed a chance to rise on the international scene. 
  The "yes" got the upper hand only in four cantons: Geneva 
(54.7 percent), Vaud (53 percent), Neufchatel (52.8 percent), 
and Jura (52.4 percent). Fribourg said "no" to the blue helmets 
with one of the lowest majorities against: 52.3 percent. The 
Valais rejected the idea with more determination: 60.6 percent. 
Participation was 46 percent. All in all, 1,203,870 people 
rejected the project while 898,925 approved it. 
<H5>  A Failure for the Federal Council </H5>
  Kaspar Villiger accepts the result from a military point of 
view: There will not be any Swiss blue helmets. In his opinion, 
most Swiss people did not want to engage financial means for 
this project. Mr. Villiger further says that this vote reflects 
a certain mistrust toward parliament. Flavio Cotti also 
stressed the financial situation of the Confederation and of the 
welfare state to account for this result. 
<H5>  Supporters: A Missed Opportunity </H5>
  Those supporting the creation of a corps of blue helmets -- 
namely the Radical Democratic Party (PRD), the Christian 
Democratic People's Party (PDC), the Socialist Party (PS0), the 
Liberal Party (PLS), the Independents' Alliance (AdI), and the 
Green Party of Switzerland (PES) -- have called this rejection 
by the people a missed opportunity. The causes of failure 
include the difference in funds plowed into the campaign and the 
people's feeling of insecurity at a time of recession and 
financial crisis for the Confederation. 
  Several groups in favor of the blue helmets idea are 
concerned that emotive arguments may have won the day. They 
stressed the need to promote the humanitarian missions to 
counter the negative image which this vote will procure at 
international level. 
<H5>  UDC: Loyalty to Armed Neutrality </H5>
  The Swiss People's Party (UDC) pointed out that the 
principle 
of armed neutrality remains deeply rooted in the Swiss people. 
The citizens reject any attempt to whittle it down. That must 
be taken into account in the future, the UDC stressed, noting 
that once again it is the only government party to represent the 
popular will. 
<H5>  Opponents: A "Marignano" for the Federal Council </H5>
  The Liberty Party (PDL, formerly Swiss Car Party) and the 
Swiss Democrats (DS) noted the popular result with satisfaction, 
relief, and great joy, although they were surprised by the 
extent of its clear-cut nature. The PDL felt it was a Marignano 
[1515 battle lost by the Swiss which entailed an oath of 
neutrality toward France, Milan] for the Federal Government and 
the parties supporting it. A "no" vote was the only proper 
response to the slice-by-slice policy leading toward UN 
membership, the PDL and DS said. 
  While the Swiss Officers' Association (SSO) was disappointed 
by the "no" vote, it stressed that this is not a rejection of 
the Army. The goal was not reached because it would have meant a 
proportional cut in the military budget. The Group for 
Switzerland Without an Army (GSsA) was not surprised by the 
result. The creation of such a military corps seemed in its 
eyes devoid of credibility. 
<H5>  United Nations: Switzerland Has Not Spoken its Last Word </H5>
  Vladimir Petrovsky, UN director general in Geneva, said the 
United Nations respects the Swiss people's rejection. The 
country is coming to grips with adapting to the new 
international environment. We know it is not easy and it takes 
time, the director general stressed, before expressing the hope 
that "this is not the last word Switzerland will utter on the 
matter."

<F P=106> [Article signed CC/TP: "Swiss Air Force To Be Modernized by </F>
Late 1990's"] 
  [Text] Bern, 8 June (ATS) -- The Swiss Air Force is going 
to modernize the Rapier air defense system by the year 2000. 
The goal is to make it less vulnerable to electronic jamming 
and to facilitate its maintenance, said the Federal Military 
Department (DMF). The cost of the operation is expected to be 
18 million [Swiss] francs [SFr]. 
  The Armament Group (GDA) has signed a contract with British 
Aerospace, which designed the system. The GDA has placed a SFr4 
million order so far. This modernization process will be 
presented to parliament in the framework of one of the armament 
programs of the second half of the decade. 
  The Rapier system was purchased in the early eighties. At 
the time, parliament voted an overall SFr1.39 billion credit. 
The system has been used in the Swiss Air Force since 1985. It 
makes it possible to fight targets flying at average altitudes, 
day or night, even in bad weather.

<F P=106> [Report by "mer": "DSP/PSD of Switzerland Founded"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Fribourg, 4 June -- The Democratic Social Party 
[DSP/PSD], which constituted itself as a Swiss political party 
in Fribourg on 4 June, does not see itself as a rival to the 
Social Democratic Party [SP], but as an alternative. For years, 
the party only existed in the form of cantonal organizations. 
One of its principles says that only a strong economic sector 
can guarantee social peace and progress. [passage omitted] 
  According to the statutes, the party seeks to create a 
social 
system that would permit all sections of the population -- 
particularly the socially disadvantaged and the economically 
weak classes -- to "lead a life worthy of human beings." In 
this context, the basic political statement says that the 
DSP/PSD addresses all those fellow citizens who not only think 
in democratic and social terms, but also intend to act in this 
sense and spirit. The DSP/PSD advocates a democratic and social 
state ruled by the law and the institutions of such a state, as 
well as the intellectual, economic, and military defense of the 
country. The DSP/PSD advocates a market economy marked by 
social justice, by respect and responsibility for man and the 
environment. In the implementation of its political goals, it 
will not be guided by "utopian political ideas," but will pursue 
realpolitik "through continuous reform." 
  To the surprise of everyone, not one president was elected, 
but three -- in the form of a copresidium. In the interest of 
maintaining the symmetry of the three cantonal parties, which 
are already represented in the government or at least in the 
cantonal parliament, Jules Grand (Basel city), Stefan Hosang 
(Graubuenden), and Jean-Bernard Repond (Fribourg) were elected. 
This organizational structure will be maintained until the next 
meeting of delegates. This meeting can agree on a change. For 
the time being, the party's office will be in Basel. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- North Korean Foreign Minister Kim 
Yong- nam stopped over in Berlin on his flight from Kiev to 
Pyongyang. On Friday [10 June], the Foreign Ministry in Bonn 
said the minister arrived on Thursday night and would continue 
his trip on Friday night. He had not asked for any talks and 
there were no plans for talks either. It was said that it was a 
transit stop for "technical" reasons. 
  The North Korean had visited the Ukrainian capital before. 
He was actually scheduled to go to one of the central Asian 
republics but changed his plans at short notice. His flight 
back to Pyongyang went through Berlin.

<F P=106> [Article signed SDC: "Bosnian Presidency Wants </F>
International Conference"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 8 Jun (BELGA) -- "The Bosnian presidency 
feels that it does not really make much sense to continue the 
negotiations in Geneva because these talks always end up in a 
vicious circle. Instead of these talks, there should be an 
international conference on the Bosnian issue," two members of 
the Bosnian presidency said Wednesday [8 June] at a press 
conference in Brussels. 
  Mirko Pejanovic, a Bosnian Serb, and Ivan Komsic, a Bosnian 
Croat, are both part of the Bosnian presidency and both took 
part in the peace talks in Geneva. 
  "The key question of how much territory should be given to 
the parties involved has ensured that the peace consultations in 
Geneva always end up in an impasse," they said. "Instead of the 
talks in Geneva, there should be an international conference 
with the five major powers (namely Russia, the United States, 
Great Britain, France, and Germany), the European Union, the 
United Nations, and the Conference of Islamic Countries," 
Pejanovic and Komsic said on behalf of the Bosnian presidency. 
Russia had already suggested organizing a similar conference, 
but the other partners were not interested for the time being. 
  "The idea of a federation with cantons must form the basis 
of 
a complete peace plan for Bosnia," Pejanovic and Komsic said. 
In order to stress that this is feasible, they pointed to the 
Washington Agreement whereby the Bosnian Muslims and Croats 
would set up a federation on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This federation has since been formed, a 
president has been elected, and a government is being put 
together. 
  "The international community must take care of the rest," 
Pejanovic and Komsic said: "The return of refugees, the 
setting-up of `miniprotectorates' around the most important 
cities along the lines of Mostar and Sarajevo, and the temporary 
control of the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Furthermore, the European Union should agree to the 
accession 
of Bosnia to the Union, according to Pejanovic and Komsic, 
especially with an eye on the economic reconstruction of the 
country, "which is currently a mess." In order to guarantee 
security, Bosnia must be able "to join NATO," they said. 
  Pejanovic and Komsic are in Brussels to hold talks with the 
European Commission. They will also be received at the Belgium 
Foreign Ministry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Martino Meets Ciller, </F>
Balkan Counterparts"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Istanbul, June 10 -- Bosnia and the risk that 
hostilities there could extend south was one of the central 
issues when Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino met here 
today with his confreres from Albania and the Czech Republic and 
with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 
  Official sources said later that Albanian Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi voiced "very deep concern" over the threat, 
urging a greater European commitment to the search for a 
negotiated solution. 
  Both Muslim countries, Turkey and Albania are concerned for 
the future of the Bosnian Muslims. Sources said Turkey, at 
least, looks kindly on proposals now emerging for a Bosnian 
truce next month, new proposals for the geographical division of 
the disputed ex-Yugoslav territory, and heavier sanctions 
against those who reject them. 
  The talks with Serreqi covered the whole arc of southern 
Balkan Europe in which the Bosnian war has come to be seen as a 
decisive threat. 
  One issue is Kossovo, the Serbian enclave where the ethnic 
majority is Albanian; another, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], whose recognition Greece is loth to 
grant because of its fears of future territorial claims; and a 
third, the Greek and Albanian ethnic minorities whose presence 
in the two countries has led to a sharp rise in tensions 
recently. 
  Speaking for one of a number of states on the edge of the 
Balkans, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec urged that the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] of which 
Italy holds the duty presidency should be given a peacekeeping 
capability. 
  Zieleniec asked Martino to move in that direction before the 
CSCE summit planned in Prague in December. Martino said he 
agrees to giving the organisation more agile and effective 
mechanisms. 
  The talks also covered bilateral ties. 
  Turkey's Ciller urged moves to right the trade balance, and 
Serreqi described Albania's moves towards a market economy, 
Martino offering words of encouragement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "OECD: Martino Illustrates Rome </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Paris, June 8 -- The Italian Government is 
determined to push forward and accelerate the liberalization of 
its economy and boost the number of jobs with a policy which 
coincides with global trends, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino, a trained economist, said here Wednesday [8 June] 
during the ministerial session of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  Speaking to the diplomatic chiefs and ministers for budget 
and foreign trade from the 25-nation OECD, Martino stressed how 
the commitment of the Rome government was "for greater economic 
freedom, not limited to just Italy, but one which will develop 
on an international level." 
  Yesterday, during the first day of the OECD ministerial 
session, Italy was singled out for its budget problems and told 
the best way out was through a reduction of taxes for lower 
level employment and greater flexibility in hiring regulations 
with the eventual suppression of a minimum salary. 
  Today, the OECD economic policy committee revised its 
economic growth forecast for Italy for the 1994-1994, predicting 
a 1.5 percent increase in the GDP for this year, close to its 
earlier forecast, while in 1995 the GDP is expected to climb by 
2.5 to 2.6 percent. 
  Unemployment in Italy was forecast to remain "just below" 12 
percent this year, while there should be a slight reduction in 
store for 1995. 
  In his address to today's session, Martino went on to 
underscore how "the program of the Italian Government expresses 
in an explicit way the readiness of Italy to operate for the 
enlargement of the European Union towards East Europe and to 
increase world trade relations, first of all with North America 
and the Pacific regions." 
  The Italian foreign minister then went on to add how premier 
Silvio Berlusconi believed that "nothing, in Italy's 
international trade relations, should be done which in any way 
fuels the protectionist spiral." 
  Martino also voiced his satisfaction for the agreement 
reached with Russia, also in view its agreements with the 
European Union, as well as the participation of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin at the July G-7 Naples summit. 
  In order to help support the transformation of the Russian 
economy, Italy last week took part in the renegotiation of the 
Russian foreign debt, taking on costs of close to a billion 
dollars. 
  Looking also at other countries which are evolving towards a 
free-market system, the Italian foreign minister said the 
current situation was difficult and was one to which the OECD 
had to adapt, by moving cautiously.

prospect of a new EU/Morocco agreement and the role of Morocco 
in the Mediterranean region were discussed. Mr. van den Broek 
said at the close of the meeting that Morocco was a pole of

agreement envisaged, he said that, for some aspects, there was 
already a broad basis of consensus, but that others seemed to be 
more difficult. EUROPE recalls that Morocco has submitted 
counter-proposals to the content of the new agreement, and that, 
before the opening of official negotiations, preparatory 
discussions are to be continued.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Austria Votes </F>
Massively in Favour of Accession"] 
  [Text] The 12 June referendum on Austria's accession to the 
European Union [EU] had as result a massive "yes" vote -- 66.36 
percent against 33.61 percent of "nos", with a total turnout of 
81.27 percent. Commenting on the result, Jacques Delors said: 
"That the Austrian people, very proud of their history and 
treasures, very proud too of their intellectual movement, of 
what people like Chancellor Kreisky and others were able to do, 
that this people wants to join the European Union, this a 
far-reaching event and demonstrates that the Austrians went to 
the heart of the matter. European construction has as aim to 
extend peace, mutual recognition, as well as making a Europe, 
threatened by decline due to global changes, radiate. The 
Austrians understood all this. It is therefore, I believe, a 
great lesson." 
  In Stockholm, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said that 
this clear victory of the "yes" vote was a "positive sign" for 
the referendum on accession planned by Sweden for 13 November, 
and in Finland, Minister for Trade Pertti Salolainen, who said 
he was "amazed" by this "crushing majority," also predicted 
positive effects "for Finland and the other countries" which had 
negotiated their entry into the Union (in Finland, the 
referendum will take place on 16 October).

  Introducing the communication Mr. Flynn said that "drug 
addiction and drug trafficking constitute a major threat to the 
citizens of Europe. This threat demands a coordinated response 
by the Community and the member states. This document provides 
not only a framework for the Union's future action to combat 
drugs but also an integrated action plan." 
  The Treaty on European Union provides a new framework for 
combatting drugs which considerably strengthens the Community's 
powers and enhances cooperation between member states. The 
Treaty offers new possibilities to consolidate existing 
Community achievements and promote the further development of 
union-wide strategies. The prevention of drug dependence and 
the fight against drugs are specifically mentioned in the 
provisions introduced by the Treaty on public health and 
cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs. The 
Commission wants to ensure that this new legal basis for action 
is exploited to the full in order to promote the highest 
possible level of cooperation and coordination. This will mean 
that the drugs scourge is tackled in the most comprehensive and 
effective way. 
  Commissioner Flynn pointed out that in line with the wishes 
expressed by the Brussels European Council of 10 and 11 December 
1993, the action plan provides a new framework for a drug 
control strategy covering three key elements: 

  -  prevention of 
drug dependency 
  -  reduction of drug trafficking, and 
  -  action at the 
international level. 

  Each of these key elements is examined in the communication. 
Measures proposed within the framework of the new union action 
plan are designed to consolidate existing Community achievements 
in these fields and take advantage of new possibilities opened 
up by the Treaty on European Union in the fields of public 
health (Article 129), common foreign and security policy (Title 
V), and cooperation in the fields of justice and home affairs 
(Title VI). 
  The communication also highlights the importance of 
coordinating anti-drug measures at national level and within the 
Union as a whole in order to enhance the overall coherence of 
the Union's actions. 
  Furthermore, in line with the emphasis given to the fight 
against drugs within the Union, drugs had been singled out as a 
priority of the common foreign and security policy. 
  Considering the heavy impact of the drugs problem on the 
political and socio-economic development of developing 
countries, drug control will be given a stronger emphasis in 
political discussions with developing countries including ACP 
states. 
  The action plan will also be supplemented shortly by a 
further and more detailed communication to the Council and 
Parliament concerning Community action in the field of drug 
dependence under Article 129 with a proposal for a decision on a 
programme of Community action in that field. 
  Commissioner Flynn expressed the view that the action plan 
"will provide an effective framework for the Union to fight 
against drugs and drug dependence in the foreseeable future."

  [Text] Brussels, June 15 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization issued an invitation to Russia Wednesday [15 June] 
for "immediate" discussions aimed at defining the terms of 
military cooperation between the two sides, a NATO spokesman 
said. 
  He said it was up to Russia to choose who should represent 
it 
at the talks, diplomats in Brussels or a delegation from Moscow, 
and added that the alliance was awaiting a response from Moscow. 
  The invitation was issued following a weekly meeting of 
ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member countries. 
  "The North Atlantic Council decided to invite Russia to 
begin 
talks in Brussels immediately," the spokesman said. 
  Russia and NATO sketched out last Friday the form their 
post-Cold War security relationship would take after months of 
maneuvering and confusion. 
  NATO said it was prepared to give Russia special leeway in 
negotiating the terms of military cooperation that would fall 
under the alliance's Partnership for Peace programme. 
  Twenty countries have already joined the programme, but 
Russia had been delaying its entry while it fought for special 
terms.

<F P=106> [Report signed GeWe: "Ukraine Agrees To Close Down </F>
Chernobyl -- Financing Unclear But Partnership Agreement Signed"] 
  [Excerpt] Ukraine is prepared in principle to close down 
all four blocks of the ailing nuclear power station in 
Chernobyl. However, it is unclear how much it will cost to 
decommission the plant and close the energy gap that will arise 
as a result. The Ukrainian Head of State, Leonid Kravchuk, who 
is currently in Luxembourg to sign the partnership agreement 
with the EU member states, believes that between $6-8 billion 
will be required. The European Commission, meanwhile, is 
talking of costs of about $1.5 billion, and wants other European 
states to contribute toward the expense. 
  Eight years after the Chernobyl reactor catastrophe, two 
reactor blocks are still in operation. By 1998, Ukraine wants 
to build another three nuclear power plants that are up to 
Western standards. Ukraine believes that the European Union 
should contribute toward the cost of building these plants by 
providing Euratom [European Atomic Energy Community] loans. The 
definitive closure of the Chernobyl power station will probably 
result in a 35-percent drop in energy supplies. Ukraine wants 
to avoid becoming dependent on energy supplies from abroad. In 
the Council meeting, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos 
had warned against the danger of a repeat catastrophe. 
  European Council President Theodoros Pangalos told the press 
that the closure of Chernobyl had not been made a precondition 
for ratifying the partnership agreement. On the other hand, 
signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty had been made such 
a precondition. 
  Among other things, the partnership and cooperation 
agreement 
signed yesterday, which still has to be ratified by the member 
states and the European Parliament, provides for most-favored 
nation status. Special agreements still have to be concluded 
for coal, steel, nuclear, and textile products. In the past the 
European Union imported goods worth only approximately ECU1 
billion from Ukraine, compared with exports worth more than 
ECU1.4 billion (0.3 percent of all EU exports). Within the 
framework of the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth 
of Independent States] program offering technical assistance to 
the members of the CIS, Ukraine received a total of ECU120 
million between 1991 and 1993 for the purposes of reconstruction. 
  After signing the agreement, Mr. Kravchuk said that it 
marked 
the inclusion of his country in the process of European 
integration, which would in turn boost the process of 
democratization. The agreement also refers to guaranteeing 
human rights. Pangalos approved the Union aid to help the 
transition to a market economy. European Commission President 
Jacques Delors described Ukraine as a link between East and 
West. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Erich Hauser: "Kinkel Appeals for Patience"] </F>
  [Text] Luxembourg, 14 July -- It might not necessarily be 
possible for the Central and East European countries to join the 
European Union [EU] by the year 2000. With this statement, 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a news conference in Luxembourg 
warned the governments in Prague, Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, 
Bucharest, and Sofia, which have associate membership agreements 
with the European Union, against too high expectations from 
Bonn's imminent EU presidency. Nevertheless, the Federal 
Government will do everything to lead the six associated 
partners "closer to the European Union," and knows that Paris 
and Madrid, which will take over the EU presidency in the first 
and second six months of 1995, respectively, will do the same, 
Kinkel said. 
  As far as the plans for nominating a successor to EU 
Commission President Jacques Delors are concerned, Bonn and 
Paris will "not ignore the opinion of the smaller member 
states." The fact that he will not comment on the plans of the 
two governments to nominate the Belgian Jean-Luc Dehaene at the 
upcoming EU summit on Corfu can be interpreted as "meaningful 
silence," Kinkel added cryptically. 
  At the summit meeting at the end of next week, one will also 
have to clarify whether two representatives of the Parliament of 
Europe and the governments of Austria and the three Scandinavian 
EU membership candidates will be involved in a "preparatory 
group" for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty, the minister 
said. Only Germany, Spain, Belgium, and the Netherlands have so 
far come out in favor of the participation of the Parliament. 
According to the four membership treaties, which will be signed 
on Corfu in a ceremony, the candidate countries will be entitled 
to participate in all EU Council sessions and in the EU 
Ambassadors' Committee with a "seat and vote." 
  Italy has raised objections in the EU Council of Ministers 
against preparing an EU associate membership agreement with 
Slovenia. Rome and Ljubljana must first settle compensation 
claims of Italian "expellees."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jerry Van Waterschoot: "Obstacles"] </F>
  [Text] Contrary to all expectations, the Dehaene government 
emerged strengthened from the European elections, at least in 
its Flemish wing. Even when it came to a fight at the ballot 
box for the European Parliament, voters did not make the most of 
their opportunity to give the CVP [Flemish Christian People's 
Party] and SP [Flemish Socialist Party] a drubbing. Whether or 
not this can be taken to mean that they approve of the 
government's policy is an open question. However, evidently 
voters were not totally indignant at the actions of the Dehaene 
government. 
  The most important event of the elections, namely, the fact 
that the renewed VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] failed to make 
a breakthrough, is a nonevent in Flanders. One may puzzle for 
weeks over why the blue [color of VLD] tidal wave never came 
about, but there would be little sense in doing so. No tidal 
wave materialized, except in the predictions made by the opinion 
polls. The citizens did not turn their backs on the message 
issued by the VLD. Indeed, unlike a number of politicians, they 
never went over to it in the voting booth in the first place. 
  If there is relief in the Flemish Government camp, then this 
is less true for the PS [Walloon Socialist Party] and PSC 
[Walloon Social Christian Party]. Some serious blows were dealt 
in comparison with 24 November 1991. Two years after it did so 
in Flanders, the far right has also made inroads in Wallonia, to 
the great dismay of a large number of Walloons, who thought they 
were immune to that virus, which they pityingly viewed as a 
Germanic phenomenon. 
  As was the case at the last European elections, [PS] Jose 
Happart succeeded in channeling a large number of dissatisfied 
citizens in his direction. The farmer and former mayor from 
Voeren is a populist maverick. An accident-prone individual who 
is looked askance on by the PS leadership, but who is tolerated 
on the party's list because he brings in as many 250,000 
write-in votes, a figure which represents as much as 13 percent 
of all Walloon voters. 
  So the government will find it heavy going on its Walloon 
flank. Not only are the PSC and the PS seeing their support cave 
in, but Happart's influence within the PS is also growing. He 
is already busily cashing in on it. Happart is threatening to 
become Voeren's mayor again. He is calling for a fresh "return 
of heart" by increasing minimum wages and minimum benefit 
payments. Happart can hamper the coalition. With the St. 
Michael accord, the government succeeded in putting the 
community pests on ice. They did so in expectation of the 
regional parliaments also being directly elected in the general 
elections at the end of 1995, and of calling upon the community 
energy at that time. 
  At the economic level, this government has just recently 
significantly scaled down its "return of heart," which the 
previous government had hastily embarked on. In a country where 
the end of the restructuring of the budget and social security 
is not yet in sight, and in a Europe where the meaning of 
minimum thresholds for the payment of wages and benefits is 
increasingly coming up for discussion, Happart certainly intends 
to row very much against the current. 
  The Dehaene government is not taking things as far as some 
other European countries, where left-wing or center-left 
governments are implementing a "right-wing" policy. In recent 
years, at the social and economic level, the coalition of 
Dehaene has set to work in an unmistakably "labor party" manner. 
However, at the same time, the policy falls within the logic of 
the restructuring process, and circumstances are resulting in 
the emergence of traits that can be described as liberal: 
privatization, flexibility, imposing responsibility, 
competitive companies. Perhaps that is why voters did not 
consider it worthwhile to defect to the VLD.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "A Vote for Nothing"] </F>
  [Text] Millions of European electors have just voted, 
testing their leaders and governments despite themselves, 
apathetic here, excited elsewhere, in elections which avoided 
many of the major European issues. The elections lacked emotion 
over the war in Bosnia, lacked correctness in a true debate on 
structural employment, and did not address the soul and contours 
of the current enlargement process. Commenting on the results, 
which leaders referred on Monday [14 June] to the Austrian 
decision to join the European Union (EU)? The Twelve now know 
they will become 13, and perhaps more on 1 January 1995. This 
event has not been stressed enough and has more importance in 
European history than a furtive and temporary snapshot of public 
opinion. 
  The paradoxical result of this non-European vote, unworthy 
of 
Europe's democratic tradition, is that it does not fundamentally 
change the Strasbourg parliamentary balance any more than it 
endangers European construction. 
  The Socialist group remains the leading political force in 
Europe, followed by the Christian Democrats. These two groups 
together hold the keys to all the pro-European votes in 
Strasbourg. Therefore European construction will not suffer from 
the emergence of anti-Maastricht votes like the Villiers list in 
France and the June Movement in Denmark. 
  However, it would be wrong to not reflect upon what has 
happened in France and Denmark. The two countries saw a 
significant rise in participation rates. This is not by chance, 
because they were the only countries, along with a more 
unanimous Ireland, to organize referendums to approve the famous 
European treaty. 
  Flattered that its views were asked, public opinion in these 
countries has become fired up, far more than elsewhere. Europe 
has been the subject of major debates, sometimes out of place 
but often legitimate. And it is these major debates which were 
so cruelly lacking in the other Europe, the one which voted so 
undecidedly, openly displaying its indifference when the vote 
was not obligatory.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Stable Relations in Luxembourg -- </F>
No Surprises at the Elections"] 
  [Text] The "Hei Elei" [Luxembourg Television] factor 
unintentionally produced an exciting election yesterday. 
  According to initial projections that were circulated in the 
early afternoon, the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of 
Luxembourg] was to suffer a crushing defeat and the DP 
[Democratic Party] was to record a landslide gain. 
  The sober verdict of the electorate was quite different. 
Both the CSV [Christian Social People's Party] and the LSAP 
suffered slight losses throughout the country, which cost the 
two governing parties one seat each, but the Liberals did not 
achieve the breakthrough they had hoped for--they merely 
consolidated their 12th seat, which Josy Simon's defection had 
already secured for them a year ago. 
  The "Greens" turned gray out of sheer disappointment when 
they received only five instead of the 10 to 11 seats they had 
hoped for. 
  The Communist Party and New Left were cast into the 
political 
wilderness where they join the National Movement. The ADR 
[Action Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], with its 
populist pension claims, achieved a reasonable success which the 
next government ought to build on in order to deal with this 
important question of basic justice. 
  Otherwise, it was a quiet election day in Luxembourg, one 
which caused the international agencies, in view of the 
perceived stability, to forecast a continuation of the present 
coalition. We must wait and see.

<F P=106> [Commentary signed LZ: "Government Policy Not Disavowed"] </F>
  [Text] In yesterday's elections to replace the Luxembourg 
Chamber of Deputies there was no landslide in the distribution 
of seats but only minor shifts. Just as the election campaign 
was a quiet affair, the results were equally unspectacular. 
  The first conclusion to be drawn is that the Luxembourgers 
are generally unwilling to engage in uncertain or even risky 
experiments. As before, they are playing safe, giving 
preference to the proven grouping of the large, traditional 
parties. 
  Second, the government's policy was widely sanctioned since 
none of the two parties who have governed together for 10 years 
was greatly discredited. The CSV [Christian Social People's 
Party] and the LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg] 
suffered only minor losses. 
  A third characteristic of these elections is the role played 
by the four minor parties in splitting the vote, despite the 
fact that the three major parties maintained their position. As 
a result, seats were lost by the parties capable of forming a 
government. It may be doubted whether this situation is of any 
advantage to the democratic power game in the state. 
  Since the electorate largely confirmed the government's 
policy, it did not expressly desire any political change, 
logically enough. So the gains of the DP [Democratic Party], 
which is still the third strongest party, can by no means be 
taken automatically as a plebiscite for taking over government 
business. Nevertheless, the DP's gains are clear enough to make 
this party the real, albeit modest, winner of yesterday's 
elections. 
  After the weak opposition and in view of the vague election 
program, however, the question was raised as to how the DP 
managed to make these gains and whether they are due more to 
protest votes rather than convinced supporters. It should also 
be borne in mind that this party reached a rare low point in 
1989 with only 11 seats. 
  The minor losses suffered by the governing parties are due 
first to the natural signs of wear and tear after 10 years of 
coalition politics. This government, which has borne the 
responsibility for such a long time and which has had to make 
many unpopular decisions during that period, came out of this 
remarkably well yesterday. The CSV in particular, as the 
leading party in government, is likely to feel that its policy 
and role have been vindicated, the respected figure of Prime 
Minister Jacques Santer having undoubtedly made an important 
contribution to this recognition. 
  The LSAP has profited less from this government bonus. Just 
like the CSV, it lost many votes to the splinter parties. 
Moreover, it has had responsibility for certain departments 
which have recently provoked extensive discussions and disputes, 
e.g., the health reforms, which have made many citizens feel 
unsettled. Moreover, the Socialist Party derived no benefit 
from pushing the ideological claims of its rabble-rousers to the 
center of the election campaign, thus jeopardizing the nation's 
internal peace. 
  The most annoying result for the major parties was 
undoubtedly that of the ADR [Action Committee for Democracy and 
Pension Fairness]. Nevertheless, the scandal that this party 
incurred, with the lies and smear campaigns concerning alleged 
party donations, was sanctioned retrospectively yesterday by so 
many voters via the polls that these people have been given five 
seats as a reward, believe it or not, and hence the status of a 
parliamentary group. What were these Luxembourgers thinking 
about when they made that decision yesterday in the polling 
booth? Were the shabby, nationalistic, anti-European slogans 
and the pensions policy used as a bait worth more to them than 
basic political honesty? 
  The fact that the Greens did not achieve the breakthrough 
many people thought they would is all the more surprising 
because many young people have become eligible to vote in the 
five years since the last election, and it is widely assumed 
that the Greens receive the greatest response and acceptance 
from this group. Although with five seats the GLEI-GAP [Green 
Ecologist Initiative List/The Green Alternative] will now be 
able to constitute a parliamentary group, this result cannot 
hide the fact that they have lost their original impetus, and 
the young voters have turned clearly to traditional parties, and 
not necessarily to the left either. On the contrary, taken as a 
whole, the left has not been strengthened by any means by 
yesterday's election. 
  The Communists and the New Left in particular were cast into 
oblivion. But they were not the only ones. The extreme right 
of the National Movement were also put in their place, and this 
against a background of an internationally increasing resentment 
of foreigners which seems to stop at Luxembourg's borders 
though, and after the second attempt to compete with the 
Democrats for seats in the chamber. 
  The Luxembourger's rejection of the really extremist forces 
may placate those who, after the relative success of the ADR 
built on demagogy and lies, have yesterday evening lost their 
faith in the good sense of some of the voters.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F>
Democracy's Demand for Cutbacks Puts Talks Under Pressure"] 
  [Text] The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 
is putting the "purple" coalition [comprising the VVD, the Labor 
Party (PvdA), and Democrats 66 (D66)] negotiations under 
pressure by demanding extra cutbacks on social security 
benefits. The PvdA opposes this measure and, in turn, is 
pushing for cutbacks in areas including defense and road 
construction, which the VVD finds difficult to accept. 
  The VVD regards cutbacks in the WAO [Law on Labor 
Disability] 
as unavoidable in order to find sufficient funds for a general 
reduction in tax levels. [VVD leader] Bolkestein suggested 
cutting back the level and duration of benefits. "We have gone 
through the central government budget in detail some three times 
now, and eventually you exhaust the possible ways of finding 
money there. That means that great emphasis has to be laid on 
social security. We are hoping to do that through quantitative 
measures, but if that is not successful, then we must reach for 
the ultimate weapon," he said. 
  On Tuesday [14 June], PvdA leader Kok repeated once again 
that such social security cutbacks were not on the agenda as far 
as he was concerned. "That is not my preference. And I will 
fight to the bitter end," he said. 
  But yesterday the negotiators succeeded in reducing their 
differences about how many extra billion guilders [G] of cuts 
still have to be found. On Monday, the VVD felt that another G2 
or G3 billion should be saved on top of the G7 billion regarded 
necessary by PvdA leader Kok. 
  But on Tuesday evening, VVD leader Bolkestein said: "If that 
were to be all, then I would say: That is totally inadequate. 
But Kok has explained that other elements must be included as 
well. Once again you can differ as to whether that is hard 
enough, but with it Kok clearly exceeds the G7 billion." 
Bolkestein referred to savings on the cost of civil servants as 
an example. 
  The PvdA and D66 want to wait and see what will be yielded 
by 
the far-reaching cutbacks in the WAO, that were decided upon by 
the current cabinet. Initial calculations are based on a yield 
of G750 million. The VVD doubts whether that is enough. The 
liberals are prepared to wait a year to see how the WAO costs 
evolve, but are now demanding a guarantee from the PvdA and D66 
that further cutbacks will not be ruled out. 
  The Central Planning Bureau (CPB) has calculated that the 
provisional proposals of the "purple" coalition would produce 
only disappointing job gains. This has also put pressure on the 
negotiation process between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66. The job 
gain forecast by the CPB is so small that the negotiators regard 
the results as improbable. Therefore they have asked the CPB 
for a more detailed explanation. 
  An example of one of these disappointing forecasts is the 
plan to allocate employers a fiscal deduction for workers 
employed on the minimum wage. This could increase employment 
opportunities for the unskilled. 
  The intended coalition partners would allow the measure to 
cost G1.8 billion. According to the CPB's calculation models, 
the financial commitment in this specific wage cost subsidy 
would produce only 8,000 jobs. 
  This result is all the more disappointing because the G1.8 
billion represents nearly half of the G4.1 billion put aside by 
the three parties to improve employment opportunities for the 
unskilled. The party specialists had calculated an eventual job 
gain of 100,000. 
  The CPB also estimated the job gain produced by other 
proposals would turn out far lower than the parties would like. 
The CPB would not give a forecast for some components, because 
the calculation model is not capable of doing so. 
  CPB director Zalm has often called for the policy of 
imposing 
collective labor agreements on industrial sectors to be 
abandoned, on the grounds that this would increase jobs. The 
same applies to more flexible redundancy rules. However, the 
CPB has made no estimate of the job gain if the "purple" 
coalition were to put these proposals into practice. On Tuesday 
Zalm was not available for comment.

  [Text] London, June 15 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) is vitally interested in an immediate end of 
war in its neighbourhood and will support every solution that 
might be freely agreed upon by the nations of former Yugoslavia, 
Serbian Parliament Speaker Dragan Tomic and Montenegrin Prime 
Minister Milo Djukanovic told British members of Parliament on 
Wednesday [15 June]. 
  The Serbian and Montenegrin officials were conferring in 
London with members of the British-Yugoslav parliamentary group 
which comprises representatives of all British parliamentary 
parties. 
  The international community must support political talks and 
not war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Tomic and explained that 
Yugoslavia upholds the latest European plan for [word 
indistinct] wracked Bosnia, as it provides for a countrywide 
cessation of hostilities as a precondition for a political 
settlement. 
  The world must, however, exercise its influence primarily 
with the Moslem side which is obviously seeking ways to prolong 
the war, said Tomic. 
  He informed the group that the U.N. Security Council's 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed because of the country's 
alleged involvement in the Bosnian war, have cost the country 
$45 billion and are a threat to the region as a whole. 
  Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanoviv said that with the 
sanctions, the world is punishing only those who wished to 
protect their country. The sanctions are impermissible also 
because they are based on the policy of force and threats, which 
cannot be the foundation on which to build the new world order, 
he said. 
  He explained that the sanctions are being implemented more 
strictly than the United Nations intended, and in illustration 
mentioned the problem of importing medicines, which are supposed 
to be exempt from the sanctions. 
  Djukanovic said it is paradoxical that Yugoslavia is being 
ignored by the world at a time when very powerful democratic 
processes, deeper than ever before, are under way in the country. 
  Tomic and Djukanovic condemned war crimes and those who have 
committed them. [words indistinct] vowed Tomic. 
  The hosts agreed with the Yugoslav officials that there is 
still no readiness in the world to help create the conditions 
for lasting peace by according equal treatment to all warring 
sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "Gulf Troops Were Ill-Equipped for </F>
Chemical Attack"] 
  [Text] British troops in the Gulf war might have had to 
face attack by chemical and biological weapons without adequate 
protection, it was disclosed yesterday. 
  In a report on the implementation of the lessons of the war, 
the Commons all-party Defence Committee said it was disturbed 
that at the start of the operation to free Kuwait, Britain's 
soldiers lacked chemical alarm detectors, biological warning 
systems, specialist decontamination equipment and a full range 
of medical counter-measures. 
  Iraq had built up a terrifying array of chemical and 
biological weapons, including mustard gas, nerve agents, anthrax 
and botulinum toxin by the time the war was launched in January 
1991. 
  But the Ministry of Defence [MoD] admitted protection was 
"inadequate" and the effectiveness of treatments against certain 
nerve gases was uncertain. 
  Older reconnaissance vehicles and armoured personnel 
carriers 
lacked seals and filters to protect those inside from 
contamination. No vehicles had chemical agent monitors to 
establish whether areas had been hit. 
  The committee called for Government action to ensure 
defences 
against chemical and biological weapons were kept fully 
effective. 
  It said: ``We are concerned that it was only when there was 
a 
real possibility that our troops would be subjected to the 
chemical and biological attack that a number of important 
deficiencies and gaps were identified and rectified where 
possible in the time available. 
  ``It is a matter of great concern that these deficiencies 
were not identified and corrected by normal peacetime 
procedures. Next time we may not have the time to put things 
right before hostilities commence.'' 
  The MPs were also critical of the Army's battle-readiness. 
They said the condition of Challenger 1 tanks sent to the Gulf 
from Germany in 1990 was "scandalous," and criticised attempts 
to develop an effective friendly identification system as "a 
debacle." 
  The availability of Challenger 1 tanks in Germany in 1990 
was 
so bad that 77 per cent were out of commission at any time. In 
the six months they had time to get ready in Saudi Arabia, 
availability had increased to 98 per cent, but at a cost of 279 
engines changed during Operation Granby, most stripped out of 
tanks remaining in Germany. 
  "We are pleased that the ministry is now taking steps to 
correct the situation but disturbed that what must have been an 
obvious problem was left unresolved until a crisis emerged," 
said the report. The committee was pleased that Vickers and the 
MoD had taken trouble to apply the lessons learned from 
Challenger l's shortcomings to the new Challenger 11's. 
  There were also problems with medical equipment, including 
the inability to send armoured ambulances to the Front. Some 
equipment was outdated and up to 40 per cent of stretchers could 
not be used in air evacuations. 
  "We are disturbed that normal peacetime training and 
exercises did not identify serious deficiencies in medical 
equipment," said the committee, recommending that the MoD 
investigate why the shortcomings went uncorrected until the 
threat of war galvanised it into action. 
  As to Britain's air strength in the war, the committee said 
it was surprised that the RAF [Royal Air Force] was so 
unprepared for offensive actions at medium altitudes: it had 
focused almost entirely on low-level attacks in Central Europe. 
  CRV-7 rockets had to he bought from Canada, CBU-87 cluster 
bombs had to be bought from the Americans for Jaguars, and Rolls 
Royce engines were not adequately designed for the Gulf heat. 
  On shortcomings in electronic warfare, the committee said it 
was not convinced that enough was being done in this area by the 
MoD, and it was particularly concerned about IFF (Identification 
Friend or Foe) equipment, the failure of which cost several 
British lives when they were mistakenly attacked by American 
aircraft. 
  "The shortcomings of IFF equipment must be addressed as a 
matter of the greatest urgency," said the report, noting that 
attempts to develop an effective system had been a "debacle" up 
to now, costing Britain 50 million pounds for a system abandoned 
before the Gulf war. 
  Contractors did well in supporting British forces in the 
Gulf, but the contrast between 14 weeks to get modifications 
done in emergency, and three years in peacetime, was so stark 
that lessons must be applied to save taxpayers' money. 
  The MPs blamed excessive secrecy by the Ministry of Defence 
for the lateness of their report. 
  The MoD had produced its own classified internal Gulf war 
evaluation by Air Chief Marshal David Parry-Evans in December, 
1991, but had refused to pass it to the committee despite the 
MPs' security clearance. It was only in late autumn last year 
that the MPs received a classified report prepared for the 
Pentagon and foreign nations in NATO. 
  "At best this decision demonstrates a failure on the part of 
the MoD to accept reasonable scrutiny by a Select Committee of 
the House of Commons, and at worst it could indicate that the 
ministry is concealing embarrassing information," concluded the 
committee.

<F P=106> [Report by David Brown: "EC Farm Policy `Strangling New </F>
Democracies'"] 
  [Text] Protectionist EC farm policy is stifling the infant 
democracies of East Europe and threatening the stability of the 
West, according to a report published today by the House of 
Lords. 
  Radical reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy are needed 
to prevent "economic decline and political instability" in 
Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and 
Romania -- the six Central East European countries -- it says. 
  The report, resulting from a five-month investigation by the 
all-party Lords Committee on the European Communities, 
concludes: "Unless the Community puts agricultural trade on a 
pan-European footing not only will these countries' efforts to 
join the Community be frustrated but their very exclusion will 
jeopardise stability in West Europe." 
  The failure of trade agreements to open up EC markets to 
greater amounts of agricultural produce from the six had led to 
"growing disillusionment with the political reform process." 
  The committee found "disturbing patterns" in the working of 
these agreements which resulted in a balance of trade moving in 
favour of the EC. 
  In many cases subsidised EC food was competing for sales in 
the poorer East European markets while the EC was offering very 
few concessions in return. 
  All this was happening at a time when agriculture 
represented 
a key share of national income. "Without the much needed 
foreign currency that agricultural trade can bring them, their 
economies will decline," the report says. 
  "Both in Hungary and Poland, the first to begin dismantling 
their centrally planned economies, the backlash is now evident. 
Influential farming lobbies, now represented in government, are 
now demanding more protection: a direct response to the 
Community's own restrictive policies. Efforts to meet these 
demands could bankrupt their economies." 
  While the EC had declared a year ago that these countries 
could join the Community when they satisfied the necessary 
political and economic conditions, "the trade agreements have 
not been altered to reflect this new objective," the report says. 
  "There is a dichotomy at Community level between the 
political desire to enlarge the Community and the resistance of 
EC agricultural interests to will the means," it says. The 
Common Agricultural Policy is, it claims, the biggest obstacle 
to the six joining the EC. 
  The National Farmers' Union said that some sectors of 
British 
agriculture would be "alarmed" by the report. While the 
political arguments were understandable it had to be remembered 
that the horticulture industry in particular was already 
suffering heavily from cheaper imports.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- A day before his visit to Bonn, 
Italian Government head Silvio Berlusconi has highlighted the 
joint economic interests of both countries. Italy was one of 
the first countries to be interested in a commitment to Eastern 
Germany, Berlusconi said in an interview in the Bonn daily 
GENERAL-ANZEIGER (Thursday's [16 June] edition). 
  His country is now one of the leading investors in the East 
German states. Over 40 Italian companies have already 
established themselves on the territory of the former GDR. This 
represented "a major flow of investment," which has also led to 
the creation of new jobs, the prime minister said. 
  Berlusconi defended the cooperation between his party and 
the 
neofascists of the National Alliance. This could not be 
compared with the right-wing extremist French Front National or 
the Republicans in Germany.

<F P=106> [Report by "mue": "Kinkel: Lead EU With Great Caution"] </F>
  [Text] Restraint and extreme caution are the motto Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel of the Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] has issued for the second half year in which Germany will 
hold the European Union [EU] presidency. Kinkel said in Bonn 
that, on the one hand, people expect the largest member country 
to bring its weight to bear in order to advance the reform of 
the EU and to outline the further course of European 
integration. On the other hand, the "most powerful" partner 
state was bound to create the suspicion of wanting to shape the 
community in its fashion, regardless of what it will propose, 
the minister said. 
  It is not least due to this concern that the Foreign 
Ministry 
head is anxious about who the Community will choose to succeed 
Jacques Delors as president of the Brussels Commission. The 
decision will be made at the Corfu Summit at the end of this 
month. Kinkel was optimistic, which probably means that Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, the head of the Belgian Government and the favorite of 
France and Germany, will win the race against his Netherlands 
colleague Ruud Lubbers. Yet diplomats in Bonn have been 
skeptical and assume that although a majority will support 
Dehaene in Corfu, there will not be the necessary unanimous 
support. Then it would be up to the Federal Government, as of 1 
July, to find the candidate who is acceptable to all EU members. 
  According to Kinkel, the German EU presidency, because of 
the 
pending referendums in the countries of EU candidates Finland, 
Sweden, and Norway, would be ill-advised to come up with 
proposals for far-reaching reform. Yet reform has been regarded 
as inevitable for a long time. In view of the number of member 
states, which will continue to grow in the long term, the 
community must retain its ability to make decisions. Yet 
changing the weight of the votes in the Council of Ministers 
and, for example, keeping the number of commissioners in 
Brussels within certain limits, would be bad for the smaller 
partner states, which are to a degree enormously 
over-represented. They will be joined by the new Nordic 
members. This is why the membership opponents there might use 
any ideas launched by Bonn as ammunition for their campaigns. 
  Kinkel's difficult situation is not made easier by the fact 
that any reform resolutions are not to be dealt with until the 
Maastricht II conference scheduled for 1996. The now 
consecutive half-year presidencies of Germany and France are 
regarded within the community as the phase of significant 
decisions in European policy. Diplomats in Bonn are facing 
great expectations from the neighboring Eastern European 
countries that expect, particularly from Germany, to be led 
closer to the EU. Kinkel would like to "get them to the table" 
as best as he can. New constructions, such as partial 
membership for the Eastern Europeans (for example in 
transportation, trade, and energy policy) -- something that has 
been discussed again and again -- have been rejected by the 
foreign ministers. 
  The Federal Government will probably not react to ideas that 
suggest that, first, an inner circle of member states might 
enter into a closer union. Therefore, it rejects the plan of 
French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure for a 
"convention of the new founders." However, Kinkel has not ruled 
out that an inner circle will emerge within the community at one 
point. Out of consideration for members who would then 
presumably have to remain outside against their own will, the 
Federal Government must not promote the "two-speed Europe," 
Kinkel said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Ian Mather; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Q: Would you like to see the Bundeswehr invited by 
Russia to play an active role in solving security problems in 
the former Soviet Union? 
  A: A solution to the acute security problems on the 
territory of the former Soviet Union is important, not only for 
Russia and the other directly involved states, but for all CSCE 
countries. In individual cases the stationing of peace-keeping 
forces in a conflict area as part of UN or CSCE peace efforts 
can be an appropriate step. 
  In this regard it is also feasible for Russian forces to be 
employed in co-operation with the CSCE. The principles and 
considerations laid down at the CSCE council meeting in Rome at 
the end of 1993 must apply in this case, including the 
recognition of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the prior 
agreement of the conflict parties, the multinational character 
of the force and a clear mandate for action. 
  Participation by the Bundeswehr on this basis would not be 
ruled out on principle, provided the constitutional debate is 
favourably resolved. Let me also point out that several 
Bundeswehr officers have already been involved in CSCE 
peace-keeping missions in Georgia. 
  Q: Would participation be under UN or Western European Union 
[WEU] auspices? 
  A: Participation by the Bundeswehr in peace-keeping missions 
would always be within the scope of a multilateral operation. 
The precondition would be a clear mandate from the UN or the 
CSCE as its regional arrangement. We would have to decide in 
each individual case to what extent the Bundeswehr would 
participate in missions under the auspices of other 
organisations such as NATO or WEU. 
  Q: Do you favour German military involvement in the Balkans? 
  A: No, for constitutional and historical reasons. That 
said, the Bundeswehr participates in numerous humanitarian 
measures, such as mercy flights to Sarajevo and air drops of aid 
over east Bosnia as well as helping to monitor the UN embargo 
against the Serbs in the Adriatic. 
  Bundeswehr soldiers form part of the crews of the NATO AWACS 
aircraft which monitor and indirectly enforce the flight ban 
over Bosnia and Herzegovina. But the federal government has 
repeatedly stated that, due to the special historical situation, 
Germany cannot make a greater commitment by sending more blue 
helmets to the former Yugoslavia. 
  This applies whatever the result of the constitutional 
debate 
on this issue. In any case Germany does share the burden of the 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia in that over 400,000 refugees 
have been admitted to Germany. 
  Q: Would you agree that because of its size and economic and 
political muscle Germany must be in the forefront of European 
defence as it evolves? Can this be reconciled with Germany's 
reluctance to participate militarily in operations outside 
Germany? 
  A: The federal government has never claimed a leading role 
in the European security and defence structures developing on 
the basis of the Maastricht treaty. For any of the partners in 
the EU [European Union] to make such a claim would be absurd, 
quite apart from the fact that the decision-making mechanisms in 
the EU and WEU do not allow for it. 
  On the contrary, our priority has always been to point out 
that the European Union's common foreign and security policy 
would not be complete unless it was complemented by a common 
defence policy. For this reason Germany has always seen itself 
as a catalyst for major steps towards security and defence 
integration in Europe. These include the creation of 
multinational formations, the Eurocorps and the consistent 
development of WEU into the EU's defensive arm. This in no way 
affects our firm conviction that the Atlantic alliance is and 
will remain our anchor of security and stability. 
  There has never been the slightest doubt concerning 
Germany's 
willingness to fulfil its obligations within the NATO area 
arising from the NATO and WEU treaties. This is in fact 
expressly permitted by our constitution. 
  However, there are differing views about the extent to which 
our constitution allows for the deployment of German armed 
forces for peacekeeping and peace-making missions outside the 
NATO treaty area. The matter is pending at the federal 
constitutional court. We expect a final decision at the 
beginning of July. 
  More than six months ago, the government parties placed a 
draft law before the Bundestag designed to create a clear 
constitutional basis for such deployment. The opposition has, 
however, continually prevented a consensus which would amend the 
constitution on this point. 
  Q: What will be the aims of the German presidency? 
  A: As I see it there will be four main aims: first, Europe 
must regain its economic dynamism. Only in this way can 
unemployment be reduced on a long term basis and Europe be able 
to hold its own as a base for business against other growth 
regions, especially Asia. 
  The instrument for achieving this will be the realisation of 
the Brussels European Council meeting's plan of action. By 
doing so we hope to ensure that Europe has a bright future. 
  Second, we must bring our neighbours in Central and East 
Europe closer to the EU. Subsequent admission of these states 
is one of our contractual objectives. We seek to give the 
Baltic countries the same opportunity. 
  Third, we need to make swift progress in co-operation on 
justice and home affairs so that we can solve the urgent 
problems facing EU internal security. This cooperation includes 
above all the fight against cross-border crime, the 
harmonisation of the material right to asylum and the 
formulation of a common immigration policy. 
  Fourth, we must make consistent use of the new instruments 
and mechanisms contained in the treaty on European Union. We 
want to see the subsidiarity principle put into practice in a 
way visible to the citizens in Europe, greater transparency and 
a Europe closer to the people. 
  Q: Are the countries of East Europe ready for EU membership? 
  A: Not even the possible candidates themselves claim that 
they fulfil the necessary preconditions. On the other hand, it 
cannot be right for us to call for decades upon the central and 
eastern European countries to join our western community of 
peace and freedom, and to say now that there will be no room for 
them in the European house in the foreseeable future. 
  On the contrary, bringing these states closer to the EU is 
an 
historic task. It is an aim we have always set ourselves and 
have always wanted to achieve. Therefore we will make these 
issues a focus of our presidency. 
  Q: Do you think German unification should have been handled 
differently? 
  A: There were no blueprints for reunification. The fusing 
of two different societies and economic systems which had been 
separated by the wall for more than 40 years is a unique feat in 
history. Looking back, we would have done many things 
differently. 
  Without a doubt our greatest error during reunification was 
the false assessment of the quality of the capital stock in the 
former GDR. 
  In fact, we found that industrial plant, infrastructure and 
the environment were in a much worse state than we had assumed. 
This resulted in much higher than expected spending on 
reconstruction.

<F P=106> [Report by "km": "Bonn Submits Offer for World Trade </F>
Organization"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 14 June -- The Federal Government on 
Tuesday [14 June] submitted its offer at the GATT headquarters 
in Geneva to establish the future World Trade Organization (WTO) 
in Bonn. Unless further offers are received by this Wednesday, 
Germany will be competing against Switzerland, which would like 
to keep the WTO in the current GATT building if possible. In a 
letter to GATT Director General Peter Sutherland, Federal 
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt praised the advantages of the 
German offer. It has been said that Bonn would be willing to pay 
for the expenses of moving the GATT Secretariat (400 employees) 
and not ask for any rent. So far, in accordance with Germany's 
share in world trade, Bonn has paid about 12 percent of the GATT 
budget (110 million German marks). The costs for the trade 
organization, of which no official estimates have been made yet, 
would have to be added. Due to its many tasks, the WTO, which 
will be established in early 1995 after the ratification of the 
Uruguay Final Act, is expected to employ more than 500 people. 
Moreover, Bonn would grant diplomatic status to more 
professionals and be generous as far as work permits for 
dependents are concerned. This offer is an indirect reaction to 
complaints by Geneva diplomats about Swiss restrictions. 
Nevertheless, it has to be assumed that Switzerland will make 
further concessions in addition to what it promised so far to 
keep the organization at the European UN seat in Geneva. This 
is all the more likely, since the country is increasingly 
beginning to isolate itself in Europe. The WTO preparatory 
committee, which includes the 123 GATT members, is expected to 
make a decision before the summer recess.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin S. Lambeck: "Ruehe Makes Concessions to </F>
the FDP Regarding Military Service"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian 
Democratic Union) is apparently prepared to accept Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] proposals to make the basic 
military service more flexible. In the future, it is to take 
nine to 13 months. This is shown by the answers to a catalogue 
of questions about his conceptual guidelines, which Ruehe passed 
on to the FDP for tomorrow's session of the coalition and the 
government. 
  It mentions a range of 10 to 23 months. Since Ruehe's model 
grants one month of leave to the conscripts performing basic 
military service, however, one can start from a net figure of 
nine months. 
  Ruehe's answer is as follows: "In order to make the young 
men flexible in planning their professional life in connection 
with military service, they are to be offered the possibility of 
serving voluntarily for a longer period than the minimum." 
  Moreover, the defense minister advocates that the 
alternative 
national service time of 15 months be left unchanged. The 
reason is that two months of standby readiness are added to the 
compact basic military service of 10 months minus one month of 
leave. The basic military service for the crisis-reaction 
forces is at least 12 months anyway. 
  According to Ruehe, the peacetime strength of the armed 
forces is to be 340,000 men. Although the minister concedes an 
increase to 370,000 men to the FDP at any time, the Bundeswehr's 
infrastructure, according to Ruehe's information, will be 
designed for 340,000 men in the future: "The structures of the 
armed forces will be cut to a peacetime strength of 340,000. 
The reduction of the volume will also be reflected by a 
reduction of the organizational elements, so that the objective 
of cost reduction will be achieved." The minister makes the 
need for a new debate on the closing or reduction of bases quite 
plain: "It is clear that the consequences for the deployment 
will only be ascertained in detail in the course of the planning 
process, and decisions will be made afterward and only be 
implemented in the following years. Here, the deployment in all 
FRG regions will have to be taken into account."

<F P=106> [Report by Guenter Stauch: "Crash To Be Feared"] </F>
  [Text] In the opinion of Luftwaffe Inspector General 
Hans-Joerg Kuebart, optimism and confidence have always been the 
real characteristics of the Luftwaffe. 
  The flying corps will have to stand the test in this respect 
in the future. The red pencil is still its main opponent 
following the end of the East-West conflict. 
  The "historic low" of the defense budget (Kuebart) of just 
under 48 billion German marks affects the 83,400 soldiers of the 
Luftwaffe most. Although, according to an internal paper of the 
Luftwaffe leadership, its "weight and importance are 
continuously increasing, in view of future national and 
international tasks," an austerity course is announced on all 
fronts: By the end of the year, almost 300 aircraft -- about 
two-thirds of the total stock -- will be mothballed or scrapped, 
more than 30,000 military and 5,900 civilian permanent posts 
will be cut, and 71 bases will be closed. 
  As Kuebart suggested menacingly, in the long run this cannot 
"be without consequences for the morale of the corps, the 
operation of the armed forces, and their operational 
capability." The savings are already a real drain on the 
resources, Luftwaffe generals complain. Because of Waigel's 
savings plan, Ruehe's fighter pilots operate the control stick 
for barely 180 hours per year -- this is NATO standard. A 
spokesman of the crews said: "The situation is becoming awful." 
In the opinion of the German Bundeswehr Association, the flying 
units have arrived at a critical stage because of the drastic 
cuts. "If further austerity measures in the field of training 
and exercises of jet crews are invoked, crashes are to be 
feared." 
  The Luftwaffe inspector, who at least demands safe planning 
from the politicians -- "going beyond one day" -- sounds the 
alarm increasingly often. Kuebart, who will retire from his 
office in the autumn, leaves a flying corps that is shaken by 
violent turbulence behind. However, without it, nothing works 
in the Bundeswehr. As a matter of course, the blue-uniformed 
soldiers do their duty in Falconara, Djibouti, Phnom Penh, 
Bahrain, or Belet Huen. For decades, Bundeswehr pilots have 
jetted around the world to help people. 
  In the opinion of some NATO alliance partners who are 
calling 
for a greater commitment, including combat missions, this is not 
nearly enough. For example, the Luftwaffe is to contribute at 
least a dozen combat aircraft squadrons to the international 
crisis-reaction forces who help allies in trouble. This is a 
major cost factor, particularly since their soldiers and 
equipment always have to be combat-ready, speedily transferable, 
and highly professional. 
  Moreover, the modification of the Patriot antiaircraft 
missiles to combat ballistic missiles -- currently the only 
realistic threat -- is on the Luftwaffe's list of wishes. The 
decades-old Hawk antiaircraft missiles have to be replaced by a 
new tactical air defense system -- which costs billions.

<F P=106> [Report by "deu./ub./csc": "SPD Chairman Scharping Rejects </F>
Committing Himself to Coalition With Greens"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn/Munich -- In the Bundestag election 
campaign, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will 
clearly point out the differences to the Federal Government but 
rejects committing itself to a coalition with the Greens. 
Following the defeat in the European election in favor of a 
coalition statement for the Greens, new appeals by individual 
SPD officials in the party's left wing found hardly any response 
in the party and the SPD Bundestag group. The Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP] is beginning to concentrate on the 
dispute with the Greens as its main competitor for the role of 
the party that can create a majority after the Bundestag 
election. 
  In an address to the SPD Bundestag group on Tuesday [14 
June], SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping admitted mistakes in the 
election campaign strategy and the image of his own party in the 
past few months that might have led to the defeat in the 
European election. "The SPD, and I, must deal with Federal 
Chancellor Kohl more offensively," Scharping said. To be able 
to do this, however, he must have his "back free." In the past 
few weeks, he was repeatedly forced into the role of arbiter in 
his own party. "This ties up forces preventing us from 
launching offensive attacks." 
  In Scharping's words, the Bundestag election in October is 
not at all lost, even though, after Sunday's defeat, the 
challenge is now "more difficult than before." The SPD chairman 
called for solidarity and asked to stop the debate about a 
coalition between the SPD and the Greens. The important thing 
is to get across the SPD's reform program to the voters. 
Scharping emphasized that "the SPD cannot delegate parts of its 
reform policy to other parties, hoping that it might benefit 
from it at a later stage." 
  Individual representatives of the party's left wing, 
including Deputy Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, had 
earlier called for a commitment to an SPD-Greens coalition as a 
result of the election result. However, the great majority, not 
only in the Presidium but also the Bundestag group, rejected 
this as "nonsense." "This would mean to fall into Helmut Kohl's 
trap, because this is exactly what he wants," said Peter Struck, 
parliamentary manager of the SPD Bundestag group. The tenor of 
almost all deputies was that the party must, first and foremost, 
clearly define its government program, which clearly describes 
the differences to the Federal Government, and get it across to 
the voters more dynamically and energetically. One has to show 
solidarity and "thrash" the Federal Government, said Gerd 
Andres, head of the "Seeheimer Circle" and group of deputies in 
the party's right wing. 
  Within the FDP, a discussion has been initiated on how to 
increase the support from the bourgeois city residents again. 
On the day after the disaster, FDP Executive Committee Member 
Gerhart Baum demanded in the Executive Committee that it must be 
made possible again to identify the issues of ecology and civil 
rights with the FDP. Despite the FDP's reduction to an 
"economics party," only the Christian Democratic Union 
/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] are benefiting from the turn 
of economic trends. Baum warned that the FDP must be careful 
and prevent the liberal bourgeois from completely wandering off 
to the Greens. Kinkel, too, described the Greens, which 
received twice as much support as the FDP in the European 
election, as the "main opponent" in the Bundestag election. 
Guido Westerwelle, a member of the FDP Executive Committee, 
told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the FDP and the Greens had long 
since become serious competitors among voters under 40, as far 
as lifestyle is concerned. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "DW": "Controversial Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- After the municipal elections in four new 
laender, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is partly 
prepared for cooperation with the Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS]. Yesterday, SPD Deputy Chairman Wolfgang Thierse no 
longer ruled out such a cooperation for his party in eastern 
German municipalities. The PDS representatives must not be 
treated like lepers and thus turned into martyrs, he said. All 
parties are obliged to cooperate in order to solve the pending 
problems. This is something completely different from 
coalitions with the PDS on the land and federal level, which he 
considers impossible. 
  First offers have already been made by the successor party 
of 
the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. For example, Wolfgang 
Methling, PDS frontrunner in Rostock, stated that the PDS does 
not want "to govern the city at all costs." Methling announced 
coalition talks with the Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD. 
According to the preliminary result, in the Hanseatic city the 
PDS gains 20 seats, the SPD 16, the CDU 11, and the Greens six. 
  In Thuringia, however, the SPD has basically opposed 
coalitions with the PDS. Last evening, the land executive 
committee of the party still wanted to discuss a recommendation 
to the district and local associations not to form any 
coalitions with the PDS on a local level.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "PDS -- `Test Case' for the </F>
Office for the Protection of the Constitution"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- According to the assessment of 
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, "extreme-left 
positions" are being taken in the successor party of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS], and "lively contacts" with 
revolutionary-Marxist organizations are being maintained. This 
particularly applies to the "Communist Platform" (KPF), which 
was founded within the PDS with its explicit approval and whose 
activists openly declare themselves in favor of the 
"revolutionary idea of the socialist alternative." According to 
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the 
Marxist-Leninist KPF regards itself as a bridge to other 
communist groups and it maintains close and regular contacts, 
particularly with the German Communist Party [DKP] and the 
Communist Party of Germany [KPD]. Thus, this association has to 
be assessed as a "test case" for the Office for the Protection 
of the Constitution. 
  In an interview with the DKP newspaper UNSERE ZEIT, PDS 
Chairman Lothar Bisky explains the PDS view on cooperation with 
communists in the election campaigns as follows: "A decision 
that communists are not to be put on PDS lists has not been 
made. I would also regard it as a loss." 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, the PDS is also not "afraid of coming into 
contact" with violent extremists. As proof, the 1993 report of 
the Office for the Protection of the Constitution quotes from 
the 17th edition of the PDS member magazine DISPUT, which says, 
among other things, the following: "The PDS has a good position 
in the scientific analysis of the fascist development. 
Consistently, however, it will have to bank far more on 
extraparliamentary actions and self-help. It would be stupid to 
leave autonomous groups alone in actions that would be worth 
supporting, for example, if the `concrete prevention of Nazi 
meetings' is at issue." PDS members also participated in a 
congress of leftist groups in Hamburg to which members of the 
terrorist scene had also come. 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, PDS members also participated in the 
"Socialist-Communist Action Unit," which is operated by the KPD 
and whose objective is the founding of a "uniform Communist 
Party of Germany."

<F P=106> [Report by "ank": "Schulte Elected New DGB Chairman"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Berlin, 14 June -- At the 15th Federal Congress 
of the German Trade Union Federation [DGB] on Tuesday [14 June], 
the delegates elected Dieter Schulte as the new chairman. The 
board member of the IG Metall Metalworkers' Trade Union was the 
only candidate to succeed former DGB Chairman Meyer, who died in 
May. Of the 565 delegates, 437 voted for Schulte. That is 75.7 
percent. [passage omitted] 
  In his inaugural speech, Schulte promised the trade unions 
that he wants to "lead and bring together." He said the major 
task of trade unions is to fight unemployment. They must manage 
to strengthen the DGB's ability to mobilize its members, while 
concurrently maintaining the ability to achieve compromises. 
[passage omitted] 
  Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP], also considered the employment situation the most 
important issue of European policy. The Liberals know what 
unemployment is, Kinkel said, even if they are frequently denied 
that knowledge by the trade unions. Jobs cannot be created by 
decree. That is why the FDP advocates a labor policy oriented 
toward a market economy. Kinkel also spoke of "deregulation, 
privatization, and cutting bureaucracy," which met with much 
disapproval from the delegates. The FDP chairman praised the 
trade unions for moderate wage agreements concluded this year. 
He said he hopes this standard will also be applied in the 
talks on privatizing the German Post Office. New, 
future-oriented technologies play a large role in creating new 
jobs, Kinkel said. He once more called for a simplification of 
the social system. It is a matter of restructuring, not 
abolishing, the welfare state. Regular jobs must be given 
precedence. The FDP will not accept blame for being "socially 
insensitive," Kinkel said. 
  A number of trade union chairmen contributed to the debate 
on 
the DGB's annual report. IG Metall Chairman Zwickel criticized 
the DGB for not having a clear social concept. Zwickel said 
this is no criticism of Engelen-Kefer, DGB's social politician, 
but trade unions should increasingly agree on common policies 
that are then to be made binding for all. "We will remain the 
haunted ones if we do not comment on major topics," Zwickel 
said. Media Trade Union Chairman Hensche also made the criticism 
that the trade unions are just drifting along, without 
developing their own political alternatives. "We are not 
exactly going from strength to strength," Hensche said. 
  Hensche very fiercely criticized the policy of the Federal 
Government. Constantly blaming the trade unions of fighting for 
possession means accusing "the possessions of those who do not 
have any." "This country is not heading toward a crisis because 
the poor have become too rich," Hensche sneered. Modifying 
[Immanuel Kant's] categoric imperative, Hensche coined a "social 
imperative." It should read: "Do not demand any sacrifices from 
others that you are not prepared to make yourself." 
Sarcastically, Hensche recommended that the chancellor should 
work in public service at 80 percent of the pay earned by the 
lower wage classes in western Germany. 
  Postal Trade Union Chairman van Haaren repeated his 
rejection 
of the second postal reform. Contrary to the "privatization 
ideologists," he fears that the privatization of the post office 
will destroy jobs instead of creating them. The Federal 
Government must keep the majority of share capital in the post 
office; the public tasks of the Federal Post Office have to be 
maintained, irrespective of its legal form; and the postal 
holding must maintain a clear responsibility for control and 
coordination. The conference adopted a motion calling on 
Bundestag deputies not to agree to the postal reform unless 
these conditions have been met.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The fight against unemployment 
remains the main goal of the Social Democrats at present. "We 
need a national employment pact in Germany," SPD [Social 
Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf Scharping stressed at 
the 15th DGB [German Trade Union Federation] federal congress in 
Berlin today. "Courage and political decisiveness" are needed to 
attract available money in Germany to finance jobs and not 
unemployment. It is not acceptable that 120 billion German 
marks [DM] are spent each year to finance unemployment, he said. 
Changed framework conditions for economic and taxation policies 
are now required. 
  Scharping again came out against the solidarity levy [to 
finance German unity], which is to be reintroduced next year. 
This is "socially unjust" and "economically questionable." If 
80 percent of those liable to taxation have to "dig deep into 
their pockets," then they will be forced to compensate for this 
deficit in the next pay round. The business world should also 
be aware of this fact. Instead of a "stream of ever new taxes," 
the government should finally commit itself to an active 
campaign against tax evasion and subsidy abuses at the big 
companies, the SPD chairman stressed, in light of the recent 
scandals at Baederkoenig Zwick or concerning the property 
magnate Schneider. 
  In this connection, the "dangerously high state debt" is 
alarming. It would have reached DM2 billion by the end of the 
year. That is equivalent to a per capita debt of DM25,000. Not 
least for this reason, higher earners should at last be turned 
to in order to finance German unity. Scharping was critical of 
the low level of state expenditure for research, which only 
makes up 1.5 percent of the federal budget. Only by means of a 
clearly expanded research and development program can an 
ecologically sound economy with international competitive 
advantages be achieved. 
  The SPD emphatically appealed for more rigorous action 
against the right-wing and tougher intervention by the police 
during violence. "If drunken idiots chase citizens, then the 
police must intervene and lock them up instead of releasing them 
before the state prosecutor sees them," and the ringleaders must 
be held up by the [land] parliaments. 
  The SPD leader offered the trade union federation close 
cooperation in modernizing the social welfare state. Many 
things in the public sector are too bureaucratic and too 
inflexible. With a view to the imminent postal reforms, he 
emphasized that purposeful privatization can definitely be put 
into practice more effectively if common responsibility for it 
is accepted.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DDP/ADN) -- The German Bundesbank is 
expecting the number of people out of work in western Germany to 
continue to rise in 1994. In its monthly report for June, the 
Bundesbank said the expected level of economic growth will not 
suffice "to prevent further limited growth in unemployment." In 
eastern Germany, however, the employment situation seems to be 
stabilizing, even though official and concealed unemployment 
remains "depressingly high." The Bundesbank said 2.6 million 
persons were out of work in western Germany at the end of May, 
360,000 more than the same time last year. The number of 
unemployed in eastern Germany increased during the same period 
by 63,000 to 1.16 million. 
  The overall state of the western German economy "clearly 
improved" during the spring, the report said. "Recessionary 
trends" have evidently been overcome. Counter to earlier fears, 
the GDP during the first quarter did not fall again but rose by 
a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent compared with the fourth 
quarter of 1993, and by 1.5 percent against the first quarter of 
1993. A "continuation of this moderate upward trend" is 
expected for the rest of the year. The main driving force here 
is currently foreign demand, showing that Germany's exporters 
have generally retained or restored their competitiveness. 
  The Bundesbank said there was a "clear continuation" of the 
upward economic trend in eastern Germany during the first months 
of the year. Output in the manufacturing sector, previously one 
of the eastern German economy's "weak points," "rose no less 
than 21.5 percent" over the first quarter last year. The report 
said this was apparently because more and more eastern German 
companies are recovering lost market shares and gaining a 
foothold in the western German market. However, exports have 
failed to recover. Eastern German companies have so far failed 
to secure in western export markets the success needed to make 
up for the loss of their East European export markets.

<F P=106> [Report by "hk": "Monetary Policy Has To Be More </F>
Intelligible"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- "It is of particular importance 
to inform the public about the reasons for monetary policy 
action and inaction," stressed Alexandre Lamfalussy, president 
of the European Monetary Institute (EWI), in a lecture delivered 
on Tuesday evening [14 June]. Information policy becomes all 
the more important if more flexibility is displayed in using 
money supply targets as an instrument. 
  Lamfalussy applied the statement to countries that are in 
the 
envious position of being able to pursue a monetary policy based 
on rules, while also establishing a money supply target because 
of a stable relationship between money and prices. However, the 
same also applies to countries that cannot set any money supply 
targets. "For them, the obligation to achieve price stability is 
of even greater importance," said the EWI president at the sixth 
"International Frankfurt Banking Evening." 
  Lamfalussy's impression is that things are developing in a 
positive direction with respect to the greater intelligibility 
of monetary policy decisionmaking, and he said the appropriate 
steps taken by the Bank of England were exemplary. Regarding 
the situation in Germany, he said: "As far as the Bundesbank is 
concerned, I have noticed a constant increase in the depth and 
breadth of the flow of information. The public is being 
informed about the interpretation of facts and numbers that 
affect decisionmaking as well as the reasons for the decisions 
that are made." 
  There is no question of the premature abandonment of the 
strategy of announcing money supply targets, stressed Bundesbank 
President Dr. Hans Tietmeyer, speaking at the same event. As 
long as there are clear indications of marked distortions in 
relation to excessive monetary growth, the strong expansion of 
the M3 money supply should not prompt inflationary fears. 
[sentence as published] The development of the money supply is 
not an indicator of future price trends, but of the danger of 
inflation: "As long as all other sources allow us to be 
confident that prices are developing in the right direction, a 
certain degree of pragmatism is justified." 
  A glance at the way in which the cost of living price index 
is evolving really does provide a basis for optimism. It is 
true that the latest figures do not correspond to the 
Bundesbank's ideas about price stability, but they show that 
things are developing in the right direction. Tietmeyer's 
actual words were: "According to all current forecasts, we will 
continue to make progress -- exchange rates, in particular, 
indicate that." 
  Of course, one has not disregarded the fact that current 
problems with directing the money supply have made it more 
difficult for the markets to assess monetary policy. The 
current way in which the monetary supply is developing does 
indeed place the Bundesbank under a great obligation to provide 
explanations and justifications, said Tietmeyer, confirming 
Lamfalussy's statement on intelligibility. Ultimately, the 
difficulties that exist can only be resolved through a gradual 
"deceleration," even if that might have to occur over a longer 
period of time.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "Voters Prefer Characters </F>
Like Waigel"] 
  [Text] In the spring, Bavaria's governing Christian Social 
Union [CSU] was at times worried that it would not get 5 percent 
of all votes cast in Germany and would have to leave the 
European Parliament in Strasbourg. During the election 
campaign, however, the prospects improved. Opinion polls showed 
that voters considered the CSU "competent" on European policy, 
and they honored this by giving the party almost 7 percent. 
Edmund Stoiber's criticism about "Brussels," about the flood of 
directives and expenditures, about the danger that, through the 
Community, France's bureaucratic centralism and interventionism 
would be spread throughout Europe, has apparently impressed 
people. 
  Thus Stoiber would have won the elections -- if Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union [CDU] had not been even 
more successful. Those who do not like the Community as it has 
developed in the past 30 years should not vote for the CDU in 
European elections, because this Community undisputedly is the 
product of the Christian democrats of the six founding 
countries; France, Italy, Benelux, and the Federal Republic. 
Logically, they hardly ever criticize Brussels. However, the 
Bavarian sister party is led by someone who has not entertained 
the public or the electorate with loud criticism, but has 
frequently adopted a certain tone in Brussels itself -- Theo 
Waigel. That is why he should be declared the winner of the 
European elections, even though there is no scientific basis to 
say so. No one will doubt that he is a convinced European. 
Nonetheless, in the Council of Ministers, he kicks against the 
pricks -- or, rather, against the zeitgeist -- time and again, 
and frankly tells his counterparts what Germany would consider 
good European economics policy -- self-imposed moderation 
instead of hunting for responsibilities, austerity instead of 
distributing subsidies in a self-important way, primacy of price 
and monetary stability instead of inflationary employment 
policy. In Brussels, by the EU, most ministers mean something 
else. However, that does not worry Waigel, and now it looks as 
if the elections had shifted the club of 12 in his direction. 
  For this direction, the term "subsidiarity" was introduced. 
In the new European Parliament, a clear superiority of 
Christian democrats and conservatives over social democrats and 
socialists has developed. The latter are working for a 
centralist and interventionist Community, because they intend to 
give employees in the EU equal, and the highest possible, social 
security, irrespective of the country where they work. For 
social democrats, this forms part of the solidarity in the 
Community and it forms part of the single market, which in 
theory is supposed to give employees mobility between Scotland 
and Sicily. The Christian democrats are equally dedicated to 
this goal. The conservatives, who have now risen to become the 
third force, tend toward a basically different policy -- 
competition between the systems. Brussels does not impose the 
system, but cultivates competition and makes sure the rules are 
respected. Solidarity and help for the weaker members have a 
place here. However, they are not the Community's most 
important task. 
  Following European elections, the economic policy helm in 
Brussels will not be turned abruptly, but will at best be 
slightly changed. According to economic expert Horst Siebert, 
the Community will only stay together if it learns to see itself 
as a competitive society.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "Europe Votes for `Europe </F>
Light'"] 
  [Text] In the early postwar days, "More luck than sense" 
could have been the (West) Germans' secret motto. The economic 
miracle and the return to the international community were 
brought about within a very short time. Today, following the 
European elections, the stress must be on "sense." It is true 
that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] are unhappy about their serious losses, 
but the whole of Europe can only be happy about the behavior of 
the German voters. The Germans have rejected the rat catchers 
and the terrible simplifiers more clearly than the voters in 
other countries. 
  The Republikaner (1990 -- 7.1 percent) are no longer in the 
European Parliament, the "German mark above everything else" 
party of Manfred Brunner got no more than 1 percent, and the 
National Democratic Party of Germany stays where it belongs -- 
at 2 per mill. Even the Christian Social Union [CSU], which 
conducted a hidden anti-European election campaign in a 
regionalist disguise, had 1.5 percent less than in 1990. The 
conclusion is that, in view of these election results, our 
friends' concerns about the "renationalization" of the Germans 
are unfounded. 
  The known fact that basically, the European elections are 
local elections of a national nature changes nothing about this. 
Even though the Germans (like all the others) have voted on 
themselves, the outcome is doubly good news for our neighbors. 
Helmut Kohl, the man with the large Europe button on his lapel, 
has been clearly confirmed and the Federal Republic has proved 
to be a model of internal stability, compared with France, 
Italy, and Britain. 
  The problem child rather is France, where the tickets of 
outsiders -- bankrupt people like Bernard Tapie, genuine 
reactionaries like Philippe de Villiers and racists like Le Pen 
-- have collected a total of 34 percent. If we add the 8 
percent of the communists, we have a 42-percent bloc of those 
who cannot be forced under one flag, but tell people with their 
ticket that they do not want this system. 
  Britain? It is true that John Major's Conservatives were 
defeated by Labour, but this is instability of the good kind. A 
change of power following 15 years of Tory rule is taking shape, 
which is no reason for concern for any sensible democrat to whom 
the permanent domination of any political party must be a thorn 
in the side. What is more, the strong enmity of the British 
left wing toward Europe has long ebbed away; a Tony Blair would 
not have to permanently soothe a powerful nationalist wing, as 
John Major must do. 
  Italy? The ominous fog over Rome has not yet cleared up. 
What is clear is this: Berlusconi has made considerable gains 
(10 percent), the neofascist voters do not show any remorse (the 
percentage of the Alleanza has remained the same), the old 
parties had substantial losses. Perhaps the 10-percent gains 
will make it easier for Berlusconi to bring the neofascists down 
to earth again. However, this would not change the general 
picture of Italy. With the confirmation of Berlusconi and 
company, a strong anti-European group is moving into the 
Strasbourg parliament. 
  Pars pro toto, this is also the 1994 European message: It is 
not the mild shift to the right, which is of importance, but the 
strengthening of the European sceptics -- in France and Italy, 
in Denmark and Belgium. This has also been indirectly confirmed 
by the low voter turnout -- 56.5 percent is the lowest ever 
percentage, which signals indifference. In the fourth direct 
elections, the Europeans have apparently seen how weak the 
parliament is, compared with those who really wield power -- the 
Commission and the Council of Ministers. 
  Formulating it more sharply, Europe's fate will not be 
decided by its parliament in the fourth legislative period 
either. What is more important is the larger field of forces. 
The strongest figure in the European structures is Helmut Kohl, 
but perhaps this is only so because the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union]/CSU has recently distanced itself one or two 
steps away from "Maastricht." In European policy, France, the 
"driving force of Maastricht," could block itself and thus also 
the German-French "tandem," which has seen itself as the 
spearhead of accelerated merger. 
  There is an additional decisive event that happened to 
coincide with the European Union [EU] elections -- Austria's 
audible yes to European membership. This will at first 
encourage the "imitators" in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, and 
subsequently, it will greatly advance the enlargement of the EU 
by the Eastern European reform states. Looking beyond the 
European horizon, Euro skepticism, the reluctance to go to the 
polls, and the EU enlargement may become a historic watershed 
behind which a light Europe emerges -- a larger but loose 
integrated system. 
  The more sovereign states seek to become members of the 
exclusive club, the more sovereign it will be. This is a 
natural law of international politics, and not even the best 
intentions can change anything about it. Classical federalists 
will deplore this. However, what is the alternative? An "axis" 
between Bonn and Paris? Small European special alliances? What 
the Six and Twelve failed to achieve in the Cold War, they will 
be even less able to achieve now. Moreover, following the end of 
the division of Europe, the principle should be -- "less with 
many" is better than "much with few."

  [Text] The cease-fire agreement for Rwanda was formally 
announced a moment ago during the closing ceremony of the OAU 
summit in Tunis. The agreement envisions dialogue and 
negotiation as the means to settle the conflict between the 
[Rwandan] Patriotic Front and the interim government. It should 
have taken effect immediately yesterday evening, but it appears 
that the fighting is continuing in Kigali. 
  Paris has taken note of this latest cease-fire agreement and 
expressed satisfaction with it, but the French Government 
condemned the massacre which took place in a church in the 
Rwandan capital, Kigali, which is reported to have resulted in 
30-40 deaths, according to the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Report by Henri Paillard: "European Debate in the National </F>
Assembly"] 
  [Text] After the election of the 87 French deputies who 
will take their seats in a European Parliament made up of 567, 
at a time when everybody is analyzing the purely internal 
implications of this election, the government yesterday tried to 
draw a European lesson from this election. It will probably be 
regretted that the European debate, opened by Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe, came a little late, because it would certainly have 
given some voters clarification about the European Union [EU]'s 
real problems, which were often only touched on during the 
campaign. On this subject, Jean Lipkowski (Rally for the 
Republic) regretted that the debate which had just taken place 
on the occasion of Sunday's [12 June] election was overly 
influenced by internal political considerations. 
<H5>  Dilution and Paralysis </H5>
  At the heart of this debate there were two issues which are, 
moreover, interrelated: expansion and institutional reform. 
Alain Juppe defined the problem by asking whether the EU "has 
not condemned itself to dilution by expanding." This is the 
fundamental question asked by Alain Juppe, who wondered whether 
Europe's expansion should be continued. His answer is yes, on 
certain conditions. The negotiations with the new members have 
been well conducted both for Europe and for France. 
  That leaves institutional reform which Alain Juppe admitted 
that it has not yet been implemented, adding that the June 1992 
Lisbon summit had not made it compulsory. This being so, 
various risks exist, the minister admitted. First, "a dilution 
into a free trade area and the disappearance of the common 
policies which make up Europe's identity," and second, a risk of 
"paralysis in the decisionmaking process." 
  The reform of European institutions must therefore be 
planned 
with care. The preparatory phase will take place in Corfu, with 
the establishment of a think tank. In order to ensure a 
"minimum" level of functioning of the EU machinery, Alain Juppe 
is suggesting a strengthening of the European Council; an 
increased role for the "general affairs" council; a change in 
the number of commissioners; and a better implementation of the 
subsidiarity principle, which will enable the institutions to 
operate more democratically, especially if the Commission's 
prerogatives and responsibilities are more clearly defined and 
if the national parliaments are more effectively involved in 
this approach. Moreover, this is what Philippe Seguin, as 
speaker of the National Assembly, is demanding. 
  Valery Giscard d'Estaing devoted a large part of his speech 
to institutional reform. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee asked: "What if the EU failed, either through 
rejection or through becoming bogged down." According to the 
deputy for le Puy-de-Dome, "the European campaign gave the 
measure of the disenchantment," especially through the success 
of negative ideas on Europe. 
  Institution reform must be "a vital precursor to any 
expansion. Without such reform, Europe will be powerless," he 
said, stressing his agreement with a number of the ideas 
developed by Alain Juppe. Valery Giscard d'Estaing invoked the 
dual spiritual inheritance of Robert Schuman and General de 
Gaulle in arguing his vision of Europe: An impotent Europe 
would have displeased the former, and a Europe disregarding 
France's rights would have angered the latter. 
  We therefore had to wait until two days after the election 
to 
finally have the outline of what could have formed the framework 
of a united line by the two majority parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Minister Delegate of European Affairs Alain </F>
Lamassoure: "From Blind Egotism to Enlightened Egotism"] 
  [Text] Mr. Maurice Allais does not deal gently with the 
European statesmen of the second half of this century. (Footnote 
1) (See the three articles by Maurice Allais on "Rethinking 
European Integration" published in the "Opinions" section on 26 
April, 3 May, and 9 May 1994.) In the belief that they had been 
won over to what he calls a "pro-free-trade" mentality, he 
regards them as "personally and directly responsible" for 
innumerable miseries, as the "heroes of a vast mystification," 
and as the "gravediggers of European integration." Finally, he 
says, even if they are "ignorant and thoughtless, they are 
nonetheless responsible and blameworthy." The context suggests 
that this is as applicable to de Gaulle, President Mitterrand, 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Helmut Kohl, Sir Leon Brittan, and 
Margaret Thatcher as to Jacques Delors. 
  The excessive passion of the author of this polemic should 
not be allowed to obscure the real questions this economist is 
posing. And his renown should not prevent us from answering 
these questions. As a contribution to this end, I would like to 
recall certain facts and pose certain questions. 
<H5>  Reestablishing the Facts </H5>
  1. None of the French leaders of the past 40 years, whether 
socialist or liberal, Gaullist or centrist, has defended a 
"pro-free-trade" ideology. They have tolerated the gradual 
opening up of our markets, parallel to the actions of our 
European partners, first of all, and those elsewhere 
subsequently. Where the Anglo-Saxons are concerned, the French 
view of international trade has always favored trade that is 
"free but fair." For us in France, freedom is differentiated 
from anarchy by the existence of rules, penalties, and judges. 
  2. The "free-trade" theory is the doctrine of the 
econometricians, whom Mr. Allais has indeed a right to attack, 
but the term does not reflect the real situation in current 
international trade relations. 
  From the origins of the GATT to the beginning of the Uruguay 
Round, or in other words from 1947 to 1986, only two issues were 
dealt with. They were the progressive lifting of import quotas 
and the reduction of the rates for the customs duties imposed on 
industrial goods. There many other obstacles and distortions 
that have as yet been dealt with only imperfectly, even within 
the single European market, and were only partially broached for 
the first time in the Uruguay Round. They include technical and 
health norms, national and local public markets, legal or de 
facto monopolies on imports, systematic recourse to 
counterfeiting, denial of the right to establish businesses in 
foreign countries, discriminatory subsidies or tax systems, 
foreign investment regulations, etc. 
  3. The GATT agreement remains incomplete and imperfect. But 
it marks a turning point in world trade policy, one particularly 
favorable to the interests of our country. 

  -  Not only does it 
not challenge Community preference, but, for the first time in 
the GATT negotiations, it recognizes its legitimacy. The 
mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) are valid, 
as is our French and European aid for cinematographic and 
audiovisual development ("the cultural exception"), as well as 
the subsidies we allocate to our least-favored regions or for 
technological research. 
  -  This agreement deals with several of the 
new trade distortions, beginning with counterfeit goods, on 
which penalties will be systematically imposed. Our protected 
regional designations of origin, our textile and clothing 
industries, and our luxury industries (47 percent of the world 
trade in this sector) will be the first to benefit from these 
measures. Also, the United States will no longer be able to use 
its system of federalism to justify its refusal to open up its 
public markets to European competition. Our public-sector 
businesses will be able to submit bids in Massachusetts or in 
California--and France is one of the "giants" in the 
civil-engineering sector. 
  -  The "family circle" of GATT members is 
broadening, as is the scope of its regulations. The newly 
industrialized countries, which have to date only participated 
to the extent of 20 percent of their trade, will henceforth have 
an involvement extending to more than 75 percent. And so, 
finally, our business will have access to the Asian markets 
where we have only been selling five percent of our 
exports. 
  -  Better still, the GATT, an Anglo-Saxon concept, will 
cease to exist, giving way to a veritable World Trade 
Organization (WTO) with a French concept and name for which we 
won acceptance against the initial American position. The member 
countries of this organization undertake not to have recourse 
within the organization to unilateral legislation like Section 
301, and in world trade, there will finally be a real judge--an 
independent authority protecting the weak against the abuses by 
the strong or the those willing to cheat. 
  -  Finally, this 
organization has already placed action on "ecological dumping" 
on its agenda. And we have also obtained the support of the 
United States itself for the inclusion on that agenda of the 
problem posed by the countries that refuse to respect the 
conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on the 
basic rights of workers. 

<H5>  An Armed Peace </H5>
  As we have no desire to ignore reality, we know that the 
commercial peace negotiated in this way will remain an armed 
truce for a long time yet. That is why we have further 
strengthened the capacity of Europe as a deterrent force by 
providing ourselves with a more flexible and efficient 
antidumping apparatus. Without waiting for the implementation of 
this provision, for example, we have already reduced the import 
quota for Chinese footwear by 40 percent, imposed antidumping 
fees of 100 percent on Japanese television sets, and persuaded 
the Americans to reject the "buy American" requirement with 
regard to the public- sector market. 
  All of this has been accepted by 117 countries. We did not 
have the power to force their agreement, but we were able to 
persuade them. Who could hope for more, in France or elsewhere? 
To the extent that we think within the national framework alone, 
alternative policies are possible, and insofar as we confine 
ourselves to the world of ideas, there is no limit on 
flexibility. To be sure, one can dream of a an imaginary 
republic--an administrative autarchy according import quotas on 
a discretionary basis to the more civilized or the more 
barbarian nations. However, harsh international realities force 
us to move from the realm of pure reason to that of practical 
reason. 
  Of course, we are not naive. We know that there are ulterior 
motives everywhere, and that goodwill is not universal. We are 
all too aware that the U.S. Congress is not enthusiastic. 
Everything will depend on the capacity of the Europeans to 
remain united in implementing the agreement, just as they were 
united in negotiating it, and on the determination of our 
governing leaders. Edouard Balladur's government will not flag. 
<H5>  The Debate on Jobs </H5>
  So much for the documents. Let me proceed to the questions 
we 
are all asking ourselves. 
  In the past 40 years, world trade has developed more rapidly 
than world production. Exports have been the permanent motive 
force behind growth, particularly for the European countries. 
  However, would trade with the countries characterized by low 
wages destroy jobs? Yes, unless we were capable of resisting 
this competition. But if that is the case, how can it be that 
our country has an enduring surplus with almost all of the 
countries with low income levels? 
  Even within the EEC, we have a surplus with Spain--more than 
15 billion! The same is the case with Portugal, Greece, and 
eastern Germany, while there is a serious deficit with western 
Germany, despite the fact that the wages there surpass ours by 
22 percent. 
  Let us turn toward the east. We have a surplus with the 
countries of Central and East Europe, whose deficits with us 
have even doubled in the past three years. 
  Let us look southward. Despite our purchases of hydrocarbons 
from Algeria, we have a surplus of eight billion francs in our 
trade with the Maghreb. 
  Turning to the Far East, we have a surplus, overall, with 
regard to the Asian "dragons," including South Korea. China, 
which boycotted our products for political reasons, is the sole 
notable exception. 
  And so, all in all, a reduction in our trade with the 
countries characterized by low wages would destroy a substantial 
number of jobs in France. Fortunately, the United States did not 
suffer in the 1950's from the blind egotism that is urged upon 
us today. At the time, the per capita income of a Europe in 
ruins was only a third the figure in America. After the 
protectionist misconstructions of the 1930's, the OECE 
[Organization for European Economic Cooperation] and the GATT 
brought about the rebirth of a more or less fair trading system, 
which proved of tremendous benefit to all the participants 
therein. 
<H5>  New Consumers </H5>
  Let us dwell for a moment on the position of America as the 
richest country in the world, one technically capable of 
producing everything better than the others can. If one were to 
follow the theory of sacred egotism, it could be claimed that 
the United States should not trade with any other country, since 
any imports would destroy jobs there. Obviously, this is absurd. 
Unless the term "ignorant and thoughtless" is applicable to 
Messrs. Bush and Clinton, who agreed to a free-trade agreement 
with Mexico, as did the members of the Congress who ratified it. 
  But how can it be, in fact, that with a given level of 
growth 
in production and/or foreign trade and/or the trade balance, the 
same apparent effect on jobs is not produced in all countries? 
Why is it that for 10 years, Switzerland, Sweden, West Germany, 
and more recently, Great Britain--all neighboring countries with 
economies comparable to ours, and equally open to the world 
economy, have had substantially lower unemployment rates? Why is 
unemployment among the young a specifically French malady? 
  Rather it would appear as if the changes in the job 
sector--the pairing of job elimination and job creation--depend 
on three main factors. On the one hand, there is technical 
progress, and on the other, the social and administrative 
rigidity that slows the adaptation of our productive system to 
this progress. And, finally, there are the changes in society 
itself that affect either the active population (rates of 
activity among young people or women) or the distribution of 
services within the market economy (meaning jobs for which the 
market provides remuneration), public intervention (meaning the 
jobs financed by taxes), and, finally, family solidarity 
(meaning activities outside the official economy). 
  If this is the case, how can one deny that international 
trade is one vehicle, among others, of progress? And that the 
emergence of Asia and Latin America from underdevelopment thanks 
to trade is good news for all of mankind, including ourselves, 
since it means hundreds of millions of new customers for our 
manufacturers of automobiles, trains, planes, telephones, and 
even luxury products, as well as for our highway, port, and 
airport engineers, and for our suppliers of banking and software 
services. In short, for everything that we do better than others 
do. 
  On one proviso, obviously a basic one. And that is that the 
trade conditions be equitable and fair. This is why we wanted 
the GATT replaced by the WTO. 
  When I was in grade school, the blue on the atlas indicating 
French possessions covered half of Africa, part of Asia, and 
could be found on all five continents. As a world power, France, 
like Great Britain--pink in the atlas--could dictate conditions 
to its trade partners, which occupied an inferior, indeed a 
subordinate, position. 
  Times have changed. There is just one world economy, and all 
of the partners are equal in dignity. The population of the 
planet has tripled in one generation. The leading motive dynamic 
force is no longer (for the time being?) to be found on our 
continent. Moreover, we need allies, even for the defense of our 
vital interests. This is indeed the leading purpose of European 
construction. Now, while we no longer control the economic game, 
it is a fact, on the other hand, that the institutions we have 
devised to regulate world regulations, beginning with the new 
World Trade Organization, are accepted as legitimate by all the 
actors on the stage. 
  Let us be wise enough to make the best use of this fact. Let 
us not blame the poorly-paid Polish worker for the miseries that 
are due first and foremost to our own very French rigidity. Let 
the demagogues claim that the ailment should be treated by 
making the germs illegal, and that the unemployment problem 
should be resolved by putting the agents who punch tickets back 
on the stagecoaches. Let us also leave to them the monopoly on 
invective toward the scientists and statesmen who are 
courageously pleading the case for progress, minor but 
essential, in human relations. Let blind egotism yield, little 
by little, to enlightened egotism.

  [Text] A big bang in the Socialist Party: Michel Rocard is 
prepared to put everything on the line -- his post as Socialist 
Party first secretary, and even his candidacy in the 
presidential elections. It should be said that since the 
Socialist Party's European election flop, criticism has been 
raining down on him from all directions. Marie-Eve Malouine 
reports from Rue Solferino, where a meeting of the Socialist 
Party bureau is taking place: 
  [Malouine] Michel Rocard is facing up to his 
responsibilities. The first secretary considers that he bears 
the major responsibility for the 12 June results. The Socialist 
leadership asked him to put a question mark over his candidacy 
in the presidential elections. He has agreed. It is the 
Socialists who will choose their candidate, but the time has not 
yet come. Anyone who so wishes can run, but these concessions 
made by Michel Rocard do not yet mean he is abdicating. 
  The very serious failure in the European elections, the 
first 
secretary said, is an individual and collective failure for the 
party. Renewal of the Socialist Party is imperative, and Michel 
Rocard announced that he will be the one to oversee it. He is 
to make these proposals at the first national council meeting -- 
very likely on 19 June -- at which he will ask for a vote of 
confidence, a way of regaining a certain legitimacy. This is not 
the most difficult challenge, however, as Michel Rocard goes for 
double or nothing.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "A Senate Report Stresses </F>
France's Difficulty in Deploying Its Long-Range Intervention 
Forces"] 
  [Excerpts] In a report, the Senate, which discusses the 
Military Programming Law on 14 and 15 June, notes that there is 
a discrepancy between the government's political desire to give 
France powerful "rapid deployment" forces and the resources it 
has allocated to this plan. According to Jacques Genton 
(Centrist Union sentor for le Cher), the report's author who 
approves the programming law's broad outlines, this ambition 
will nonetheless be difficult to achieve in view of the 
inadequacy of the budget. 
  France's decision to form units -- on the scale of three 
divisions -- which can be rapidly "deployed" over a long 
distance is an objective which is deemed "particularly ambitious 
and difficult to achieve" by the senators. This assessment, 
shared by many other deputies, is featured in a 300-page report 
commissioned by the Senate's foreign affairs and defense 
committees, which Genton focuses on the Military Programming 
Law which the Senate is debatting from Tuesday 14 to Thursday 16 
June. 
  Both the defense white paper and the draft 1995-2000 
Military 
Programming Law suggest the creation of interservice units known 
as "rapid deployment" forces, to deal with a series of scenarios 
for French military involvement overseas. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Between 120,000 and 130,000 Men </H5>
  The author of the Senate report notes that, according to 
current estimates, "the requirements in available rapid 
deployment forces have been assessed at between 120,000 and 
130,000 men, which seems to be a particularly ambitious 
objective and one which is difficult to achieve," because the 
aim is to have, in all, between two and three divisions 
"combining heavy resources, light resources, powerful air-mobile 
resources, and deep and accurate fire." France has learned the 
lessons of the Gulf War, when it had difficulty forming a 
division of some 15,000 men. However, the shortfall in 
equipment is far from having being resolved by the new Military 
Program Law submitted to Parliament. 
  Mr. Genton gives some examples of this in his report, which, 
however, welcomes the fact that the existing government has 
pledged to halt, as of 1995, the slow erosion in funds allocated 
to defense over the past 10 years or so. 
  First, the Army: In future it will only have eight divisions 
out of the 15 which it still had in 1981; its stock of armored 
vehicles will fall to 650 Leclerc tanks instead of 1,000 AMX-30 
tanks; its battle helicopters will ultimately consist of 215 
Tigre helicopters, compared with 340 Gazelle helicopters at 
present, and its level of professionalization -- which is also 
reflected in the number of officers or junior officers compared 
with the conscript forces -- is much lower than that of the 
allied armed forces. 
  Second, the Air Force: It will fall to 380 fighter planes, 
instead of the 450 of previous years, and it is not due to have 
its first six Rafale planes until the year 2001; its logistical 
transport capabilities remain modest and it lacks in-flight 
refueling planes; the reduction in its manpower between 1981 and 
1991 has affected career staff (down 4,554) more than the draft 
(down 3,012). 
  Finally, the Navy: In addition to the reduction in the 
number of ships, which has gone from 150 in 1985 to 115 in 1994 
and probably to 103 in the year 2004, there is the gradual aging 
of the fleet, which should reach an average age of 18 years in 
the year 2005; it is short of officers (between 5 and 6 percent) 
considering the increase in its missions. 
  In these conditions, Mr. Genton thinks that the prime 
minister and his defense minister are right to "resist the 
temptation to launch new programs," with the exception of a 
project for a missile fired with accuracy over a long range, and 
to "continue the existing equipment programs," for which large 
amounts of funds had already been spent. He nonetheless 
expresses his anxiety about the idea that the funding of 
research, which is the guarantee for the future, is suffering 
the "repercussions" of the financial effort devoted to 
operational equipment. 
  Aside from this observation, it is a fact that the military 
program includes the postponment of a number of initiatives 
until after 1997, because of the current financial constraints. 
This is particularly true of the Navy, which is still the main 
"vector" of a long-range action policy, with the postponement of 
any decision on a second aircraft carrier, on the NH-90 
logistical helicopter, and on the need to have three of four new 
landing craft transporters.

<F P=106> [Report signed "P.K.": "High-Speed Train: A Decisive </F>
Technology Transfer to Korea"] 
  [Text] After signing, in Seoul yesterday, an agreement to 
supply a number of high-speed trains to South Korea, the 
Franco-British group GEC-Alsthom would not comment much more on 
one aspect of the deal, namely the comprehensive technology 
transfer it entails. 
  Korea has ordered 12 billion francs worth of rolling stock 
and equipment. 
  However, only half this amount will flow to GEC-Alsthom, as 
the deal provides for 34 out of the 46 trains to be built by 
Korean manufacturers. 
  In other words, there is a significant technology transfer 
component which, by the end of the decade, will allow Korea to 
build and export a high-speed train similar to the "TGV 
Atlantique" developed in the early eighties and operated in 
France since 1988. 
  For Korea, this is a decisive first step toward becoming a 
manufacturer of high-speed trains. Nevertheless, GEC-Alsthom is 
trying to reassure those who fear that Korea might have obtained 
what it needs to surpass the Europeans within 20 or 30 years in 
this high-tech field, as has been the case for shipbuilding. 
<H5>  Heavy Investment </H5>
  Beside its technological lead, which it is vowing to 
maintain, the group indicated that it expects this transfer of 
technology, which is being paid for through license fees, to 
lead to cooperation, not competition, beyond 2000. 
  "We hope to be able to establish mutually beneficial ties," 
GEC-Alsthom says, "as has already been the case with other 
license holders, for instance Canada's Bombardier, which is now 
a partner." 
  Unlike car manufacturing, or even shipbuilding, the world 
market for high-speed trains is very limited: In 13 years, 
GEC-Alsthom has prevailed in all calls for bids, but those were 
not all that numerous: Spain, Texas, Northern Europe, and the 
Paris-London link via the Chunnel. 
  Of late, only two countries have been considering building a 
high-speed link: Canada and Taiwan. 
  Whatever the future of train transport may be, one can 
reasonably consider that demand will remain modest at the 
beginning of the next century. 
  In such a context, says GEC-Alsthom, one cannot see another 
country joining the already bloated club of manufacturers, all 
the more since doing so would require investing very heavily 
with no guarantee of future profitability. 
  It seems more likely that Korea insisted on technology 
transfer because it saw it as a way to improve its own 
techniques, such as welding, in order to apply them to other 
industrial sectors. 
  Let us wish for GEC-Alsthom's sake that it is so.

European Parliament [EP]? In the presidential contest which has 
just started in Strasbourg, the PDS' outgoing secretary's name 
is among six leading candidates, together with the two Belgian

are considered the favorites), Social Democrat John Hume from 
Northern Ireland, French center-right leader Dominique Baudis, 
and Spanish millionaire Abel Matutes. The election of the

  [Text] The first meeting of the Northern League's federal 
political secretariat ended shortly after midnight. During the 
meeting, matters pertaining to the organization and work of 
League leaders in national institutions were discussed. 
  The League confirmed its full support for the government. 
Institutional Reforms Minister Francesco Speroni also explained 
the meaning of the words laborism and independence. Laborism is 
understood as "nonconservatism" and independence as "a faction 
of constructive criticism" within the government, which 
"propels the League into goverment."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mancino Opens Up to Forza Italia: </F>
Together in Europe"] 
  [Text] Rome -- In Italy, not yet; in Europe, yes. Nicola 
Mancino, PPI [Italian Popular Party] floor leader in the Senate, 
is not opposed to Forza Italia joining the European People's 
Party [EPP] group in the European Parliament [EP], but believes 
that it would be better for there to be a prior understanding 
between Forza Italia and the PPI. 
  While Pier Ferdinando Casini, encouraged by the CCD's 
[Christian Democratic Center] election results, is starting to 
think about the establishment of "a new moderate and modern 
popular party," the PPI, having gotten past the European 
elections, is introducing a policy of conditional -- and for the 
moment only external -- collaboration with Berlusconi. Mancino, 
explaining that he was speaking in a personal capacity, said: 
"Membership of a party is one thing, and membership of a 
parliamentary group is another. I would not oppose membership 
in the EPP for parliamentarians elected on Forza Italia's lists. 
The British Conservatives are in it; I do not see why the 
Italian conservatives should not be in it. However, Forza Italia 
cannot usurp the PPI's position; there would need to be a prior 
agreement...." 
  "It seems a reasonable position to me," Buttiglione 
commented." The PPI's ideologue said: "Forza Italia is not 
fascist; nor can the National Alliance be described as fascist, 
plain and simple. A dialogue with the PPI could facilitate 
those forces' liberation from the vestiges of fascism...." He 
added: "If I were Kohl, I would ask Berlusconi to explain to me 
why he governs jointly with fascists or postfascists, rather 
than with the Popular Party. And, depending on his reply, I 
would express an opinion on Forza Italia joining the EPP group." 
  Buttiglione, who is convinced that "the defects of Forza 
Italia will sooner or later turn into opportunities for the 
PPI," expects that the congress will not be an easy one ("there 
will be some fists flying, and I hope that none of them hits 
below the waist.") Rosy Bindi said she is convinced that 
Buttiglione will not be the next PPI secretary. Meanwhile she 
is organizing -- together with Giovanni Bianchi, Raffaele 
Cananzi, and Alberto Monticone -- a conference focusing on 
Catholic concerns. It will take place on Saturday [18 June]. 
"Guests" will be given a questionnaire consisting of 10 points. 
The last is the most difficult: "Do you still have faith in 
the future of the PPI, and if so, why?" 
  Casini, the "cousin" in the government, issued an analysis 
that sounded like an appeal: "The elections have shown that 
there are centrist voters.... We shall have to see whether the 
PPI congress takes account of this development and expresses a 
preference for a moderate alignment or whether, on the contrary, 
it continues to conceal its preference for dialogue with the 
Left."

<F P=106> [Interview with Venice Mayor Massimo Cacciari by Roberto </F>
Bianchin; place and date not given: "A New Leader Right Away 
Would Be a Mistake!" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Venice -- The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] 
must not elect a secretary. At least, not for the present. 
This, because it would be a mistake to continue along the path 
of the past: "Another missed opportunity." This was said by 
Massimo Cacciari. According to the philosopher and mayor of 
Venice, the PDS must first hold a great convention of 
nonconfessional voters and the Catholic Left to prepare for the 
establishment of a new "left-wing democratic coalition." Only 
after that, in October, should the party congress elect a new 
secretary, on the basis of an "original" program and a "clear 
and precise" political proposal. Meanwhile, the PDS would be 
administered by a "committee of guarantors" comprising D'Alema, 
Veltroni, Bassolino, and Vitali -- all potential secretaries -- 
and presided over by Napolitano or Trentin. 
  Cacciari is not running either for the secretaryship of the 
PDS ("I do not even hold a membership card") or for the 
leadership of the future left-wing coalition. But he is willing 
to make his own "contribution," within the time limits imposed 
on him. "I work 12 hours a day for 4 million lire a month as 
mayor of Venice...." His office, on the first floor of Ca 
Farsetti on the Grand Canal, is full of faxes arriving from all 
over Italy, many from PDS members. Some people are insulting 
him because of his criticism of [outgoing PDS Secretary] 
Occhetto ("this is your last warning; stop it, or things will 
turn ugly"), while others grant him their unconditional approval. 
  "I have some respect for Occhetto and for what he has done," 
Cacciari said. "The decision to change the name and the face of 
the PCI [Italian Communist Party] was a historic and important 
one, albeit belated, necessitated by events but conducted in 
line with continuity with the past, with the old apparatuses." 
  [Bianchin] But you described him as a loser.... 
  [Cacciari] Why not? Who won? It was a fact that he would 
lose, and that the PDS was not proceeding quickly enough. Mine 
was a political criticism, not a personal attack. 
  [Bianchin] What about his resignation ? 
  [Cacciari] It permits the start of a phase--in preparation 
for the congress--within the PDS and a new phase for the entire 
Italian Left. This is good; but Occhetto was not the problem. 
The main problem remains the strategy that the PDS lacked, and 
still lacks, and that the Left as a whole -- and I say the Left, 
in a manner of speaking -- lacked, and still lacks. 
  [Bianchin] Why should the PDS not elect a new secretary 
right 
away? 
  [Cacciari] Because that would change nothing with respect to 
the past, irrespective of who is chosen. I am saying that a 
proper congress must be held for the entire progressive 
alignment, and every effort must be made to involve not only the 
nonconfessional Left but also the Catholic and European Left. 
The purpose of the congress would be to discuss the status of 
the Left and to devise a final option for federalism. It should 
be a great opportunity for debate, which is what the PDS wants, 
but it should involve the rest on an equal footing. This 
decision must be made very promptly, by the end of July, so as 
finally put an end to all the complaining, the attacks on the 
government, and boorish, affected antifascism. 
  [Bianchin] So no secretary for the time being? 
  [Cacciari] It would be a bad thing and counterproductive. It 
would mean electing a secretary just for the sake of doing so. 
He would be merely the secretary of the old PDS, even if he 
were God almighty. After all, there is no hurry, just a few 
months, there is the summer.... The party can be led by a 
committee of guarantors who will organize the convention and set 
the pre-congress machinery in motion so as to hold a congress in 
October, to discuss the result of the convention, to resume the 
political initiative, and to organize and formulate a program of 
its own at last, an original program. In this way the secretary 
would emerge from this group and would be the expression of an 
entirely new policy line. And it would be in his interest too 
to be elected by a congress rather than a National Council 
session. 
  [Bianchin] But some people say that the Left is already 
dead.... 
  [Cacciari] I am very optimistic. The political earthquake is 
by no means over and is still fully under way. It is necessary 
to display flexibility, cultural substance, and rapidity of 
movement. For instance, it is necessary to start drawing a 
distinction between party structures and the building of the 
left-wing democratic coalition. Because in order to govern it 
is necessary to form broad coalitions; it is necessary first to 
define the relationship between the structures and leadership of 
the coalition, which must be not a superparty but an electoral 
and government alliance, led by its own candidates, not by a 
coalition secretary. So it will be necessary to broach the 
crucial issue of the coalition, of relations with the Catholics, 
which means not negotiating with Segni or the PPI [Italian 
Popular Party] but issuing a strong, true, and winning appeal to 
those who really want to build a new policy. Because, despite 
appearances, this can be done now.

  [Excerpts] There was a huge anti-Mafia operation in Milan 
this morning. Hundreds of people were arrested by the police. 
The northern gangs of the Calabrese Mafia have been broken up. 
They managed a huge drugs trade. Details of the operation were 
given a short while ago in Milan by Milan's Chief Prosecutor 
Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Chief of Police Vincenzo Parisi, and 
Interior Minister Roberto Maroni. Paola Maria Anelli reports: 
  [Anelli] [Passage omitted] Dozens of people belonging to the 
gang of Giuseppe Mazzaferro, a very important member of the 
Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, were the target of the operation. For 
many years the gang had deep roots in Lombardy, in Como, Varese, 
Milan, and Brescia. [passage omitted] A total of 370 people -- 
100 of whom were in jail -- were served with preventive 
detention warrants in Lombardy, Apulia, and Calabria. They were 
charged with holdups, extortion, drug and arms trafficking.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Walter Veltroni: "Important Choices in Stormy </F>
Years"] 
  [Text] [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] 
Achille Occhetto's resignation is similar to his work over the 
years. There is the same generosity and the same impetuosity, 
without which the PDS would never have been born. Achille 
Occhetto is certainly no conservative, either in politics or in 
his life. Nor has he ever been attached to power. He likes 
pure politics, he likes to challenge conservatism of every kind. 
This cultural, even more than political, attitude has enabled 
him to make difficult choices at the right time. To look back 
now over the years of his secretaryship causes a feeling of 
seasickness, inasmuch as the waves were high and the navigation 
difficult. And yet at times of great difficulty Achille 
Occhetto succeeded in making the right choice. Some examples? 
The response to the bloodthirsty events of Tienanmen, the 
decision to "remain within" the institutional referenda, and 
support for the Ciampi government. Indeed, he has never lacked 
that rare gift in politics, courage, the willingness to take 
personal risks. As he did in November 1989 when he took prime 
responsibility for a task of political innovation that would 
have frightened anyone -- the transformation of the PCI [Italian 
Communist Party] and the building of the PDS. Occhetto and his 
youthful leadership group in Rome and throughout Italy devoted 
their best energies to that task. The fact that there is now a 
strong left-wing force is due to that courageous choice. And in 
subsequent years Occhetto acted on the basis of a correct 
motivation -- to build a modern Left capable of uniting and 
capable of governing. The course that was pursued was not 
always straight; the fact that there is now a strong left-wing 
force is due to that courageous choice. And in subsequent years 
Occhetto acted on the basis of the right motivation -- to build 
a modern Left capable of uniting and capable of governing. The 
course that was pursued was not always straight; there were 
errors and delays. But it was the right course, in a rough sea. 
And major successes were scored on the basis of that motivation 
-- in the 1989 European elections, the referenda, the municipal 
elections. The last two elections, however, have revealed a 
major difficulty within the Left, an inability to interpret the 
demands for change and innovation. 
  Of course, not all the responsibility lies with Occhetto. 
Nevertheless the PDS secretary has decided to facilitate the 
innovation of his party and of the Left with his gesture. But 
the main issue is not leadership. There are other more 
difficult, and certainly more worrying problems. For instance, 
how to initiate a process of genuine policy innovation, based on 
the ability to identify the major options of "innovation" on 
which to challenge the Right. I would cite, for instance, 
working hours and related issues, federalism, the regulations 
governing the media, and the strategic option for the so-called 
"information highways." Convergence must be developed between a 
government of the Left and a democratic Catholic center that 
must individually seek possible understandings on legislation 
and policy. The language and political forms of the Left must 
be rebuilt. The party must be reshaped, with a new and strong 
organizational network capable of inventing new forums for 
politics, new centers where citizens can gather according to 
their interests and professions. Finally, we must carry out our 
opposition to the right-wing government tactically -- not 
filibustering to prevent it from governing, but rather waging 
tough battle on issues and principles placed on the agenda by 
the progressive forces. That is no small matter. But it is 
urgently necessary, right away. If we want to grant the 
supporters of the Left and of the progressive forces new pride 
in their support and a new desire to win. Come what may, 
Achille Occhetto will contribute to this quest. 
  This is a "difficult time" for me; there are ties that bind 
people who have lived through the same experiences and the same 
political situations. These ties are created by days spent 
together, difficult moments, disappointments, enthusiasms, 
difficult tests, and courageous decisions. Disputes and 
solidarity. Ties that are not easily broken.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Indro Montanelli: "In the Name of `The </F>
People'"] 
  [Text] [Prime Minister] Berlusconi should confine his 
statements to monologues. Composed in advance, committed to 
memory, rehearsed over and over in front of the mirror, they can 
even seem spontaneous and impromptu. Press conferences -- where 
you really do have to be spontaneous in response to journalists' 
malicious and sometimes underhand provocations -- do not suit 
him. He showed this again the other day when he allowed himself 
to say that RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], being a 
public service of the state, cannot set itself against the 
ruling majority. This displays an alarming conceptual confusion 
on his part between state and government. 
  But this is not the worrying thing. What worries us much 
more is the fact that, in the face of a tide of angry responses, 
he said he was confident of having conveyed the thoughts and 
feelings of what he calls "the people," as is proved, he says, 
by opinion polls. We all know the unconditional trust that the 
prime minister places in opinion polls, and the fervent 
enthusiasm that the organizers of these polls grant him in 
return. But in this specific instance we are afraid that they 
did tell the truth: "The people" probably do like the prospect 
of six television networks (three RAI and three Fininvest) 
setting aside debates and disputes to praise the new regime and 
its "helmsman." 
  We are very well aware of where this path leads. This is 
particularly clear to members of my generation, who have already 
experienced it. But before sounding the alarm, we who work in 
the "mass media" should consider why "the people" prefer a 
single sector of the media, not too concerned about whether or 
not it is free. Have we so badly used, or rather abused, this 
freedom, since the allies returned it to us, as to make "the 
people" long for a return to censorship? We put this question 
chiefly to the left-wing forces, recalling the fierce 
sectarianism with which they persecuted whoever sounded a 
different note from them. 
  Some will say that it is not opportune to hold a trial on 
abuses of freedom at a time when freedom is in jeopardy. This 
is true, which is why we will not persist with it. But only 
these abuses can explain the indifference with which the 
so-called man in the street responded to the helmsman's remarks 
and justify his claim of having made them on behalf of the 
people and with their tacit consent. I was still in short pants 
when Matteotti [antifascist] was assassinated. But I still 
remember what people around me said about it. After six months 
of heated campaigning in the press (there was no television or 
radio at the time) in which nobody could any longer distinguish 
truth from lies, people welcomed with relief the 3 January 1925 
speech with which Mussolini gagged the press and announced the 
dictatorship -- that which, amid the forced silence of its 
opponents, led us to the racist laws and to the disaster of 
World War II. 
  Berlusconi is not Mussolini. He has no corpses on his 
conscience. And we see on the horizon no earth-shattering 
tragedies such as those into which fascism found itself drawn. 
But it is this very climate of fascism, of exemption not from 
problems (those, we have), but from the existential anxieties 
that make us receptive to the great principles, that could open 
Berlusconi's way to a "democracy by proclamation." Not of the 
Palazzo Venezia [fascist] kind, which would be too extensive for 
him. But that of the Casa Rosada, which permitted Peron to 
harangue the crowd as follows, "They say a dollar costs 10,000 
pesos. But when your wives go to the market to buy meat, do 
they pay in dollars?" and to win the applause of those same 
"people" whom Berlusconi now cites to argue, on their behalf, 
the subjugation of the entire powerful and influential mechanism 
of television to the interests of his majority. 
  He will succeed because the people are with him, and not 
with 
us. And when the people set themselves behind someone, the men 
of the media eventually support the people. I saw this happen 
at the start of my life. I never expected to see it at the 
close. But it seems that it must be so.

  [Text] The police discovered weapons and ammunition on 
board a yacht in Ibiza. This weaponry could have been destined 
for use by the Northern Ireland terrorist group, IRA. RNE in 
the Balearic Islands reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Customs officers and the Civil 
Guard intercepted a consignment of weapons on a yacht moored at 
the Marina de Botafoc leisure harbor in Ibiza. Four people were 
arrested during the operation: a Briton, an Irishman, a 
Canadian, and a New Zealand woman. Among the materiel seized 
were assault rifles and machine-guns, bullet-proof vests, and 
10,000 cartridges. The police have not revealed where this 
materiel came from nor where the yacht was headed. The yacht 
had been moored at Ibiza's leisure harbor for some days. 
Initial investigations point to a possible link between the 
four arrested and the IRA terrorist organization.

  [Text] Felipe Gonzalez has ruled out early general 
elections, and he does not think it is necessary to reshuffle 
his cabinet. He said this in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 
where the fourth Latin America summit closed last night. The 
prime minister also said that he does not think there are enough 
reasons at present to submit the goverment to a confidence vote 
in the Cortes although he would be prepared to do so were it 
necessary: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I do not rule it out, but I am 
not 
giving an immediate response to that problem because it is not 
an immediate problem. [end recording] 
  In statements made before starting his journey back to 
Madrid, Gonzalez described a possible alliance with the United 
Left as difficult, but said he is open to dialogue with the 
Popular Party although with the following warning: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] Responsibility for government 
will 
belong to the government's under all circumstances. If the 
government cannot discharge this responsibility then it will 
have to make other decisions but what it will not to do is 
abdicate its responsibility. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Defense To Save 690 Million"] </F>
  [Text] By next year, the Danish defense will be operated 
with 700 million fewer kroner. 
  This is stated in a previously secret report from Defense 
Minister Hans Haekkerup (Social Democrat) who, in this way, has 
set the stage for a political battle during the final stages of 
the election campaign. 
  The planned cuts consist of two items. In the future, 
expenditures on UN actions -- including the new international 
brigade of 4,500 men -- will be included in the normal defense 
budget. For next year, this figure is 390 million kroner. 
  Until now, these costs have been covered, by way of an 
exception, by the Finance Ministry. In addition, the defense 
minister wants to make a one-time saving of 300 million kroner. 
  Haekkerup has been so secretive so far that not even the 
spokesmen on defense matters from the three other coalition 
parties knew the plans in detail. 
  But CD [Democratic Center] chairman Svend Aage Jensen said, 
"Significant savings in the defense budget is not our cup of 
tea. We do not believe the time is right to cut back. But I will 
see if these figures can be verified." 
  The present defense agreement was reached in November 1992 
and it runs out at the end of 1994. It was signed by six 
parties, other than SF [Socialist People's Party] and the 
Progress Party. 
  Now Conservative leader and former Defense Minister Hans 
Engell believes that the government is setting the stage for 
"great uncertainty in the area of defense." 
  "We cannot go along. It is totally unreasonable to create 
uncertainty over the military's ability to plan for the future 
by suddenly pulling the rug from under it completely in an 
economic sense," Engell said. 
  His fellow party member, spokesman on defense issues Helge 
Adam Moller, is also attacking the defense minister for breach 
of agreement. He said that, according to Haekkerup, a so-called 
earned net interest of 107 million kroner would not be released 
in 1994, as expected, but would be carried over to 1995. 
  "This is totally unacceptable and will poison future 
negotiations toward a defense agreement." 
  "It will be totally impossible to maintain the combat 
capabilities of the military if there are cuts of 700 million. 
At the same time, this is in clear violation of a law passed in 
December on the purpose and mission of the military. This is a 
slap in the face to the parties that signed the agreement," 
Moller said. 
  The political battle will continue when a long-expected 
report from the so-called Advice and Analysis Group of the 
Defense Ministry is published today. 
  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has tried unsuccessfully to obtain any 
comments from Defense Minister Haekkerup.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Three Conclusions After the EU Election"] </F>
  [Text] Three main conclusions can be drawn from the 
election to the European Parliament [EP]. 
  The first conclusion is international and shows that the 
democratic deficit in the EU [European Union] is also to be 
found among voters. Not only were turnouts were low -- 
bordering on the insulting -- but it was also the case that in 
far too many places the European elections also played a 
domestic political role, even though the point of European 
integration is that is should be based on important 
international issues being put ahead of national 
narrow-mindedness. 
  The second conclusion is national. The voters' judgment on 
the Social Democratic Party proved to be a real punch in the 
nose, and its effects cannot but be both lasting and painful. 
The old wounds in the Social Democratic Party between opponents 
and supporters of the EU will open again, and new confrontations 
cannot but restrict the party leadership's freedom of movement 
and fuel Eurofears. 
  The third conclusion is that European integration must not 
continue being so laughable that not even a common election day 
could be agreed upon. The fact that Denmark waited until Monday 
[13 June] to count its votes while the other countries are able 
to make their results public on Sunday is a reflection of 
Denmark's fickle relationship with the EU. How it is possible 
to expect the voters to take part seriously in an election in 
which the counting of the votes depends on a country's 
willingness to pay its tellers overtime? Given that the running 
of the EP costs 5 billion kroner per year, we might envisage 
that the EP itself could take care of the cost of the European 
elections. Then we would at least be spared the spectacle of 
the timing of the announcement of individual countries' final 
results being dependent on misguided national thrift. 
  The issue of a common election day and a faster count is not 
new. Five years ago there was a similar debate, but the issue 
will be forgotten all too quickly once the EP gets back into its 
daily routine and there are another five years before the next 
encounter with the voters. 
  Just as the sixteen newly elected Danish EP deputies should 
make a common election date an issue -- albeit one with a lower 
profile -- our delegation ought also on its own behalf -- and 
that of its colleagues -- to turn the spotlight on the status of 
the European deputies. Too much of a gulf is created between 
the people and elected representatives by the fact that 
deputies' salaries, double mandates [the same person being both 
a national and European deputy], and tax-free benefits give 
rise to much more interest (and annoyance) than other pretty 
important issues on the European agenda. 
  The election was a personal triumph for the Conservatives' 
Poul Schluter and -- in relative terms -- perhaps an even bigger 
triumph for the Radical Liberals' Lone Dybkjaer, and a party 
triumph for the Liberal Party. The result shows that voters 
stuck to what they know, regardless of whether they know it from 
television or politics. 
  The election also produced a result which is very close to 
the prediction Gallup made on election day, 9 June. In relation 
to Gallup's prediction the final detailed count moved one seat 
from the June Movement to the Liberal Party. And despite a 
bigger divergence in percentage shares of the vote, the AIM 
polling organization had the correct distribution of seats. It 
is almost impossible to make more detailed predictions about an 
election result where seats are not only allocated according to 
votes for individual parties, but also according to electoral 
alliances. Several newspapers which are not reticent when it 
comes to making use of opinion polls and to voicing and 
commissioning political commentaries on the basis of these same 
opinion polls have been offended that opinion polls have been 
treated and commented on along with the results. Consequently 
they have aired the view that the politicians should remain 
silent until the final result is available. But this is 
rubbish. The politicians have a clear right to refuse to 
comment, but if they do choose to comment it is obvious to 
everyone that their views are based on opinion polls and not an 
actual election result. And also, the discussion of whether 
there is any justification for opinion polls will no longer be 
necessary when --it is to be hoped -- we have a common election 
day with the count taking place the same day as the election.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Over Half Dissatisfied With </F>
the Government"] 
  [Text] Although the government led by Prime Minister Esko 
Aho (Center Party) has increased its popular support, a majority 
53 percent of Finns are still dissatisfied with it. 
  According to an opinion poll conducted by Gallup of Finland 
for the [Oulu] newspaper KALEVA, less than one-fifth of 
citizens, or 18 percent, are satisfied with the government, and 
of these, only 2 percent said they were extremely well 
satisfied. 
  All told, the proportion of those satisfied with the 
government has risen by 4 percentage points since the December 
survey. 
  One-fourth, or 26 percent, of those interviewed said they 
were extremely dissatisfied. Another full one-fourth refused to 
state an opinion as to whether they were satisfied or 
dissatisfied. 
  The satisfaction of farmers with the government has risen by 
one-fifth since the previous poll. Of this occupational group, 
nearly half -- or 46 percent -- give the government a good 
grade. 
  Aho's own personal performance was also rated as 
satisfactory 
by around one-fifth of citizens. The prime minister's approval 
rating has risen by 4 points since December.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Olli Kivinen: "The Intolerable Problem in </F>
Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] The way that Esko Aho's cabinet operates has 
demonstrated that strengthening the role of parliament and the 
cabinet in conducting foreign policy is no simple matter. This 
cabinet's policy provides strong arguments for those who are 
opposed to to the partial transfer of the conducting of foreign 
policy from the president to the cabinet. 
  The real core of the problem is that the cabinet needs to 
govern and blaze the way if it is to be given additional 
authority in foreign policy. 
  The way that the cabinet has handled the situation that has 
arisen after the negotiations between the European Union [EU] 
and Finland has not been encouraging, but it underscores those 
very problems that are to be feared in the operations of future 
cabinets also. 
  The most important decision in our country's history that is 
to be made under normal conditions, after calm deliberations, 
i.e., the EU membership decision, has been badly confused with 
domestic policies and the inner turmoil within one political 
party. In addition to this, the way that the domestic subsidy 
plan has been dealt with is coming close to making the entire 
issue a labor market issue. 
  The reluctance of leading ministers of the cabinet, or, more 
accurately, of the Center Party, to commit themselves to the 
result they themselves negotiated, their sour expressions as 
well as evasive, sometimes even misleading statements have 
astonished even foreign ambassadors who have long tenure in 
Helsinki and are amicably disposed toward Finland. 
  The impressions gained by foreign countries can be corrected 
with precise statements. Finns are in a more difficult position. 
The citizenry has clearly expressed a desire for more 
information. The media organs are offering enormous amounts of 
it, but cabinet statements would push anyone at all into a state 
of uncertainty. The cabinet has not even voided the statement of 
its own negotiator, Esa Harmala, that Finland's domestic 
agricultural plan can be approved here only after the EU 
commission has approved it. This is not the case. The EU 
commission only makes statements to members and Finland is not a 
member. The details of a domestic plan are neither conditions 
for, nor obstacles to membership. 
  At its worst, uncertainty nourishes doubts expressed in 
tavern discussions that the cabinet is trying to use its 
waffling and confusing information to force wage earners into 
opposing the membership, thus making the entire membership 
project null and void. 
  Anyone at all can conceptualize endless hypothetical 
examples 
of the kinds of difficulties the country is faced with if 
foreign policy is demoted to be a part of an internal power 
struggle within one political party. As an extreme situation, 
one can even imagine a situation in which a national defense 
decision is postponed due to the inner conflicts within one of 
the leading governing parties. 
  Simply put: Foreign policy is a matter in which a small 
country cannot afford to play political bumper pool in the same 
way as with domestic income distribution issues or details of 
social policy. 
  The cabinet must define its objectives, realize them, and 
stand behind the results. Order must reign in foreign policy. 
Else, the country's credibility will waver. 
  Minister of Development Cooperation Toimi Kankaanniemi is a 
different matter altogether. He is a hostage of the cabinet so 
that his party cannot too seriously erode support for the bigger 
governing parties. He is opposed to the EU membership push, in 
other words, cabinet policy. His staying in the cabinet is 
assured by well-chosen words that do not prevent his preaching 
against integration. In conditions reminiscent of an ice hockey 
match, it is strange that one member of the team is trying to 
shoot in the opposite goal. 
  In addition to this, Kankaanniemi has become involved in the 
dispute about the status of Jerusalem, again contrary to the 
policy of the Finnish cabinet. The Middle East crisis is 
complicated enough without a noncomprehending and uninformed 
Finnish minister's becoming involved in a dispute on which 
Israel has not been able to get the backing of even its 
staunchest Western supporters. Continuing to hang on to 
Kankaanniemi as a cabinet member adds to the atmosphere of 
confusion. 
  The drafting of foreign policy has been made more difficult 
already by the emergence of new concentrations of authority. The 
president of the Republic has his own staff, so does the prime 
minister. The foreign ministry bunker is as old as the hills and 
will not change into anything else. Construction of yet a fourth 
fortress is well under way as the Armed Forces are making more 
efficient their operations in political wrangling over national 
defense policy. 
  The United States is a superpower and can afford the 
legendary vying for supremacy between the White House, the State 
Department, and the Department of Defense. Russia also recalls 
its greatness and absorbs two foreign policies, the president's 
and the military's. A small country cannot afford any confusion.

<F P=106> [Report by unnamed FINSKA NOTISBYRAN correspondent: </F>
"Differing EU Signals From Iceland"] 
  [Text] Reykjavik -- In an interview with an Icelandic 
publication Icelandic President Vigdis Finnbogadottir compared 
the Nordic countries' interest in the European Union [EU] to 
blind youthful infatuation. The publication, MANNLIF, 
interviewed the president on the occasion of the 50th 
anniversary of Icelandic independence. 
  "Our Nordic kinsmen are so deeply in love that they are 
completely forgetting the rest of the family and the fact that a 
great passion either cools, comes to an end, or ends in 
marriage," the Icelandic president said. 
  According to Finnbogadottir, the European debate in the 
Nordic countries has attached too much importance to material 
benefits. Everything else has been overshadowed in this 
discussion. 
  "There are other values which ought also to be taken into 
consideration. In the future too people will continue to think 
and write and will also need spiritual and cultural values." 
  The Icelandic president is not afraid that in its jubilee 
year Iceland will become isolated from the Nordic family or from 
European society. According to Vigdis Finnbogadottir, the 
Icelanders have no reason to have an inferiority complex. 
  "Before we reach important decisions about European 
cooperation we must weigh the situation as a people and as a 
nation. We have to be able first to strengthen our economy and 
make ourselves sufficiently strong so that we do not need to be 
afraid that people and resources will flee the country," the 
president said, referring to the economic crisis and the high 
level of unemployment in Iceland. 
  "We have to abolish expressions like `ministate' and 
`minipeople' from the Icelandic vocabulary," Vigdis 
Finnbogadottir said. These words have been used in Iceland's 
foreign policy debate. 
  "These words undermine a people's identity and 
self-confidence. The Icelandic people has no need to feel 
self-conscious," the president said. 
  But, taking a completely different approach , the Icelandic 
foreign minister has said that Iceland could perhaps apply for 
membership of the EU before the end of the year.

  [Text] The talks between UN officials and the Turkish 
Cypriot side on the confidence-building measures [CBM] package 
were concluded today. 
  President Rauf Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side 
has 
accepted all of the United Nations' requests and that now the 
requests of the Turkish Cypriot side should be accepted. He 
added that the rights granted to the Turkish Cypriot people 
should be included in the 21 March document. Denktas noted that 
the next phase will deal with the preparation of the draft 
agreement, adding that the ball is now in the court of the 
United Nations and of Greek Cypriot administration leader 
Kliridhis. 
  Denktas received Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's 
deputy special representative in Cyprus, at 1030 today and 
conferred with him for on and one-half hours. Also present at 
the meeting were Feissel's secretary; Atay Ahmet Rasit, the 
minister for foreign affairs and defense; Ozer Koray, under 
secretary of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministry; and 
presidential political advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Ergun 
Olgun. 
  In a statement given to reporters after the meeting, Denktas 
said the main problem facing the Turkish Cypriot side is to 
prepare and sign the agreement on the CBM's as a single text. 
Reiterating that the Turkish Cypriot side wants the rights 
specified in Vienna to be included in the agreement, Denktas 
said: We cannot accept any other alternative on the issue. 
Pointing out that the Turkish Cypriot side does not accept 
artificial proposals, such as letters written by the UN 
secretary general and approved by the UN Security Council, 
Denktas added: We are ready to conclude an agreement that will 
be formulated and prepared for signature through negotiations to 
be held with us. This is our right. This is what we promised 
our people. We cannot accept any other kind of agreement. At 
this point, we are defending our rights. 
  Denktas said that the United Nations wants the Turkish 
troops 
to withdraw 1 km from the Dherinia road and that the Turkish 
Cypriot side has accepted this request. He added, however, that 
Feissel was told that the withdrawal would place the troops some 
200 meters from the Greek Cypriots and that the correct and 
appropriate thing would be to remain in the middle. Denktas 
said: Our condition, however, is that the agreement be 
concluded as a whole. The agreement should be prepared for 
signature. Noting that the issue of the access road and the 
distance has thus been resolved, Denktas added that the Turkish 
police station east of the road will be relocated to the west, 
provided aid is extended for the construction of the new police 
station. He added that the Turkish Cypriot side has also agreed 
that the issue of Turkish troops crossing from the east to the 
west via the Dherinia road will be solved through negotiations 
to be held by the officers on finding a suitable route and 
method. 
  Denktas said: We have actually agreed to everything they 
requested. The only thing we want is to have a concrete 
agreement written as a single text. This shows that the ball is 
in the Greek Cypriot court. 
  In reply to a question on whether all the United Nations' 
requests were accepted and whether the United Nations had any 
additional requests, Denktas said: We believe that through the 
negotiations we have been holding for some time now at the 
request of the United Nation, we have secured concrete 
advantages for our people. We now want them to materialize. 
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Feissel said that 
the Turkish Cypriot side gave the necessary responses to the 
United Nations' requests and that he will convey them to the UN 
secretary general. In reply to a question, Feissel said that 
the UN secretary general will determine whether the Turkish 
Cypriot replies are satisfactory. He concluded by saying that 
he believes they are constructive.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis will meet UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York today. The 
meeting is considered decisive in light of the negotiations and 
decisions that will be made at UN headquarters on the future 
course of the Cyprus issue. 
  Last night, the foreign minister met in Washington with U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and U.S. National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake. In a statement, Mikhailidhis 
said the timing of his visit is most appropriate because it has 
been ascertained that the U.S. State Department is considering 
the next step in the Cyprus issue. He added that the United 
States would definitely want an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures; its firm position is to try to 
achieve something practical in the Cyprus issue. Mikhailidhis 
said the Cypriot Government fully agrees with the UN secretary 
general's evaluation that the Turkish side lacks political will 
and that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' moves are merely 
for show. 
  U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said the 
issue that is being raised now regarding the confidence-building 
measures is whether the views of the two sides in Cyprus can be 
incorporated within the framework of UN efforts to reach a 
general settlement of the issue. He said that many sides have 
dealt with this issue as an urgent and decisive issue, and that 
the UN Security Council is now searching for ways to proceed. 
Replying to questions on visits to Washington by Mikhailidhis 
and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher, McCurry noted 
that the Greek Cypriot side has accepted the UN proposals on the 
confidence-building measures made in March, while the Turkish 
Cypriot side has accepted the June variation.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that within the 
next few days he will give the reasons that led him to tell U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John Major 
that he may resign and declare early elections if the UN 
Security Council decides to continue the negotiations on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  In a statement after a ceremony to receive the credentials 
of 
the new Portuguese ambassador, Kliridhis mentioned that he 
expects Clinton and Major to reply to his letter. He added that 
he has some indications of the way the two leaders will react. 
  Commenting on the resolution that the UN Security Council 
adopted yesterday to renew the UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] 
mandate, the president noted that the resolution sends out the 
correct messages because it stresses the need to implement the 
confidence-building measures, not to continue the talks on them. 
He added it is important that a new, detailed revision of the 
Cyprus issue be made according to yesterday's resolution, and 
that all of the alternatives that are listed in the UN secretary 
general's report be examined. The president said he does not 
rule out that Butrus-Ghali's options will be simultaneously 
studied with the confidence-building measures procedure if 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas accepts the 21 March UN 
document.

confidence-building measures, despite the UN secretary general's 
clear evaluation that the Turkish side has no political will for 
a solution. [passage omitted] 
  Political observers yesterday interpreted Kliridhis' open 
warning as an answer to insistent efforts at the Security 
Council and in Cyprus -- with the continuous meetings between 
Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas -- to help the Turkish Cypriot side, even though the 
"agreement" on the 21 March document is set. 
  It must be noted that there has been no reply so far to 
Kliridhis' letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and British 
Prime Minister John Major. 
  Asked to explain the reasons that may force Kliridhis to 
resign, Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis clarified that 
this is a strictly personal issue for the president and noted 
the "inconsistency" of others, implying the United States and 
Britain. 
  Kasoulidhis mentioned that there are three hypothetical 
scenarios: a) Denktas accepts the 21 March UN document, and 
there is an agreement on the confidence-building measures; b) 
negotiations begin on issues other than the 21 March document; 
c) a dialogue begins and our side raises its objections. 
  Kasoulidhis said that in the first case we would have 
immediate agreement. The National Council's decision, to which 
the president is committed, clearly states that discussion on 
the confidence-building measures has ended. However, the 
president made it clear to National Council members that he has 
accepted the 21 March UN document, and if Denktas accepts it, 
even now, he will accept it too. 
  A serious issue would be created if talks begin on issues 
other than the 21 March UN document, because the UN secretary 
general's representatives told the president it was the last UN 
document. As a result, Kliridhis lifted his objections to reach 
an agreement. 
  In the third case, Kasoulidhis said reservations and 
objections would return to the negotiating table if we were led 
to an endless procedure. He added: Although we will also raise 
objections, our side will be in a very difficult position 
because the president has accepted the 21 March document. 
  The spokesman stressed that the president believes that, if 
necessary, he would make it easier for the Cypriot Hellenism to 
call for presidential elections in order for the new president 
to receive a public order without the obligation of accepting 
the document. 
  Commenting on an observation that Denktas may finally give a 
positive answer, the spokesman said: "Denktas supposedly has 
approached some UN positions, but not the 21 March document."

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has 
confirmed reports that the Cypriot Government has sent a letter 
to the UN Secretariat on the latest developments in the Cyprus 
issue. The Turkish Cypriot press is referring broadly to the 
letter, claiming that with this letter the Cypriot Government 
has destroyed the hopes for an agreement on the Cyprus issue.

  [Text] Asked to comment on a REUTER report last night that 
the governments of European Union states may ask the Twelve to 
take action if they believe the Turkish side is continuing to 
obstruct progress in the confidence-building measures, 
government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the Cypriot 
Government thinks that sanctions are one way to end the Turkish 
side's intransigence. Referring to the sanctions, the 
government spokesman said the most important measure is an 
embargo against the pseudostate's illegal exports, an issue on 
which a European Court decision is still pending.

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman has said that the stand adopted by the Greek Cypriot side 
demonstrates its intransigent intentions and approach to the 
confidence-building measures [CBM] process and to efforts aimed 
at finding a solution through negotiations. 
  In reply to a question on the issue at his weekly news 
conference today, Ataman recalled Greek Cypriot claims that the 
CBM process has been terminated. 
  Pointing out that the positive and constructive approach 
adopted by the Turkish Cypriot side has created an atmosphere of 
restlessness and uneasiness in south Cyprus, Ataman noted that 
the Greek Cypriot National Council has unanimously declared that 
it is out of the question to return to the CBM process. 
  Ataman recalled Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias' statement 
in Istanbul that the CBM process is dead, adding that, however, 
the British foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state 
made statements conveying that the process is continuing. 
  Ataman continued: 
  For some time now there have been reports in the Greek 
Cypriot press that the successful attitude of the Turkish 
Cypriot side is causing concern and that if the process 
continues the Greek Cypriot side will not hesitate to take a 
stand against the United Nations. Greek Cypriot leader 
Kliridhis' threat to resign has also been interpreted by the 
Greek Cypriot press as a form of blackmail against the United 
Nations. 
  As you can understand this interpretation shows that the 
stand adopted by the Greek Cypriot side demonstrates its 
intransigent intentions and approach to the CBM process and to 
efforts aimed at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem 
through negotiations.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan </F>
Papazyan by unidentified correspondent in Istanbul; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [TDN, TURKISH DAILY NEWS] What significance does it 
have for Armenia to participate in the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council's meeting? 
  [PAPAZYAN] Rather than dwell on any particular significance 
of Armenia's participation in these meetings, I want to 
concentrate on the outcome of the meeting that has just been 
held. It's well-known that some of the problems recently 
discussed are of special interest to Armenia. For example, the 
Karabakh problem had a place in the final communique of the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). It was stressed that 
the problem cannot be brought to a conclusion through force of 
arms but only in peace, through meetings and within the 
framework of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE). The emphasis put on this made us feel positive 
and happy. 
  [TDN] How would you evaluate the visit to Istanbul of 
Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev at the invitation of 
President Suleyman Demirel, and his meeting with the U.S. 
Secretary of State? 
  [PAPAZYAN] It is a mistake to put any particular 
interpretation on this. Everyone knows that there is the 
possibility of bilateral -- or multilateral -- meetings and 
discussions. This meeting has no special significance in our 
eyes. 
  [TDN] From time to time officials from the Armenian 
government are in Turkey for the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, 
NATO or other reasons. Have the meetings between the Turkish 
state and Armenian government officials helped improve 
Armenian-Turkish relations? 
  [PAPAZYAN] The normalization and development of 
Armenian-Turkish relations are as always a topic in our 
bilateral meetings. For example we spoke about this Friday [10 
June] in our meetings with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and 
Ozdem Sanberk. I am hopeful that there will be some 
developments soon. In Turkish-Armenian relations certain 
conditions have been imposed by the Turkish side. Naturally, 
efforts have to be made to put the problems which exist between 
the two sides behind us. Obstacles to improved relations do 
exist, but our meetings have taken place in an atmosphere of 
cooperation. 
  [TDN] Could you say that the Karabakh issue is the only 
obstacle to the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations? 
  [PAPAZYAN] Turkey ties the normalization of relations with 
Armenia, and the establishment of diplomatic ties between the 
two countries, to the solving of the Karabakh problem. That is, 
the difficulties that exist can be put behind us when progress 
is made towards a peaceful solution in Karabakh. However it is 
necessary to say that, from our point of view, linking the 
normalization of relations between our two countries to the 
Karabakh issue is a mistake. It's true that there are problems 
which have to be solved between the two countries and some 
continuing sources of tension. But we do not think it useful to 
make preconditions concerning the improvement of relations. The 
normalization of relations between us has important 
repercussions for the stability of the entire region. 
  [TDN] How do you perceive Turkey's having created a military 
post in Erzurum which is directed at Nakhichevan and Karabakh 
and that will be used in line with Turkey and CSCE's desire to 
contribute to peacekeeping forces in Karabakh? 
  [PAPAZYAN] We haven't received an official request 
concerning 
this desire. Our government will evaluate any such request 
whether from Turkey or any other country. 
  [TDN] It has been said for a long time in the Turkish press 
that Armenia has opened its arms to the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan], or supports the PKK, or shelters them. Although we 
know you have been asked this question very often, what can you 
say on this subject? 
  [PAPAZYAN] I'm sick and tired of having to make a statement 
on this topic. What I know is that my Turkish counterparts that 
I meet at all levels have been aware that this is simply not 
true. But what a pity it is that the Turkish press and media 
always fuel Turkish public opinion with groundless suspicions 
like this. In my opinion this hinders the normalization of 
Turkish-Armenian relations. I don't wish to believe that the 
Turkish press doesn't want the two countries to normalize their 
relations. I would say that this business is Turkey's own 
internal problem and that we have no intention of interfering in 
Turkey's internal affairs in any way. How Turkey reaches a 
solution on this issue doesn't interest us at all.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that, 
as in the case of terrorism, the difficulties in the economy 
will certainly be overcome and Turkey will become an economic 
superpower in the coming years. Ciller was addressing her 
party's assembly group meeting. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] As a democratic 
state of law, we are obliged to struggle against a separatist 
group in line with laws and moral values. We must comply with 
the requirements of democracy. We must remain unremittingly 
loyal to national and international commitments with regard to 
human rights. Despite this, we become the targets of human 
rights accusations leveled by internal and external circles, 
which serve as tools for the propaganda waged by the bandits 
through lies and deception. Certain foreign centers use the 
support to be provided to these separatist terrorists as a means 
of blackmail. They supply them with all kinds of assistance, 
both overtly and covertly. We must face all this without 
violating national and international law. We reached this 
current stage despite all these negative conditions. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the economy, Ciller reported that the U.S. 
currency rate, which soared to 40,000 Turkish lira [TL] on the 
eve of the 5 April decisions, has now stabilized at 
TL32,000-34,000. The Central Bank's overnight interest rate 
dropped from 800 percent to 30-70 percent. Interest on Treasury 
bonds also began dropping rapidly as of this week, she noted. 
  Pointing out that the monthly budget deficit, which stood 
around TL32 trillion, was reduced to 4.5 trillion, Ciller 
remarked that the government's target for this year's budget 
deficit is 107 trillion, as opposed to last year's target of 200 
trillion. She declared: For the first time in the history of 
the republic, we will halve the budget deficit. 
  The prime minister explained that the wholesale price index, 
which increased by 32 percent in the first month [following the 
economic decisions], decreased to 9 percent this month. She 
estimated the inflation rate between June and December as 20 
percent.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that all the 
targets envisaged by the 5 April economic measures have been met 
so far and the rate of inflation has started to drop fast. 
  The prime minister visited the Turkish Union of Chambers and 
Stock Exchanges and met with Yalim Erez, the chairman of the 
Union, and other officials. 
  In a statement before the meeting, Prime Minister Ciller 
said 
a large portion of the work envisaged by the 5 April economic 
measures has been carried out. She pointed out that the 
measures received great support, both from international 
organizations and from the domestic public. The first positive 
results are being received, she said, adding that the mechanism 
is now at work that will seriously improve the exports that had 
reached a deadlock and the current transactions deficit that was 
getting larger and larger. 
  As a result of a series of measures that had to be taken, 
Ciller explained that, on the one hand, while the capital and 
interest on loans are being paid, one the other hand, getting 
further loans is being kept at a minimum. In this way, she 
said,the amount of money paid in interest from tax revenues has 
dropped significantly for the first time since 1987.. 
  The prime minister pointed out that the budget deficit, 
which 
had reached 32 trillion Turkish lira, was 4.5 trillion lira last 
month. This drop will continue, she stressed.

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat 
Ataman recalled that Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish 
Democratic Party [KDP], and Jalal Talabani, leader of the 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], held a meeting in Silopi on 
13 June at the initiative of Turkey, and added: It was stated 
at this meeting that only the terror organization is benefiting 
from the current atmosphere of instability in the region. 
  Speaking at his weekly news conference, Ataman said Turkey 
found the opportunity to convey its views on Iraq to the parties 
that met in Silopi. He added that at the meeting the two 
parties also expressed their grief over the losses incurred as a 
result of the clashes. 
  At the meeting, Ataman pointed out, it was also stressed 
that 
the clashes between the KDP and PUK pose a danger to the people 
in the region. He continued: 
  We have drawn attention to the fact that the clashes between 
the KDP and the PUK adversely affect aid activities in the 
region. 
  Our policy on safeguarding Iraq's unity, territorial 
integrity, and independence was once again stressed tothe 
leaders. Within this framework, we once more stressed the 
importance we attach to the current northern Iraqi local 
administration's restraint from behavior that might shake the 
trust of the Turkish public. 
  Pointing out that the meeting in Silopi was a significant 
step toward solving the current problems through peaceful means, 
Ataman expressed satisfaction with this development. 
  Recalling the Iranian-Syrian-Turkish tripartite and the 
Turkish-U.S.-French-British quadripartite meetings held in 
recent months, Ataman said that, as was stated in the 
communiques issued at the end of these meeting, solutions to the 
problems in northern Iraq and the normalization of the situation 
in the region should be sought within the Iraqi framework. He 
added: 
  We, therefore, believe it is beneficial to establish a 
dialogue between northern Iraq and Baghdad. Our views on the 
issue have been conveyed to the leaders. We believe that both 
the administration in northern Iraq and the one in Baghdad 
should exert more efforts to overcome the current atmosphere of 
mutual mistrust. We also believe that all countries in the world 
should exert efforts in that direction. 
  In reply to a question on the elections in northern Iraq, 
Ataman said the elections, which have lately been frequently 
discussed by certain circles, should be assessed within the 
framework of the importance Turkey attaches to Iraq's unity, 
territorial integrity, and independence. Ataman concluded by 
saying: We have conveyed to the parties concerned our view that 
there is no reason to renew the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara -- Moderate Kurds and extremists are on a 
collision course as preparations to establish new parties reach 
their final stage. 
  According to political observers close to Kurdish sources, 
citizens of Kurdish origin who have no sympathies or links with 
the clandestine PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) are at the point 
of forming new political parties. They say that in the coming 
months such new parties and faces will emerge in the political 
arena. 
  However, they warn, the differences between these Kurdish- 
oriented parties will lead to an increase in political tension. 
According to some radicals, former social democrat Serafettin 
Elci's party will become the Motherland Party (ANAP) of the 
Kurds. The militant Kurds led by pro-PKK sympathizers have 
already condemned Elci's attempts to form a new political party. 
  There are important developments taking place on the left 
since various socialist groups have united and formed parties. 
  The Socialist Union Party (SBP), for example, was dissolved 
following a Constitutional Court decision on the matter. The 
former members of the SBP then set up the United Socialist Party 
(BSP) on Wednesday, after cooperating with certain socialist 
circles such as the Salvation, New Way and Socialist Policy 
groups. 
  Sadun Aren was elected chairman of the new party, along with 
the old communist Mehmet Bozisik, who is one of the founding 
members of the BSP. "All citizens have equal rights and are 
free; a classless society, with all its institutions and 
elements, in a world free of exploitation and war," sums up the 
program of the new party. 
  Elci's party has been harshly criticized by pro-PKK circles, 
which accuse it of pretending to represent the Kurds and charge 
Elci with receiving financial support from the government. The 
radical pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Ulke, in an article by 
Bedran Yilmaz, lambasted Serafettin Elci saying he had 
collaborated with the government for financial gain. 
  The paragraph on Elci ran: "Some remain quiet and witness 
the murder of a group. They can remain silent since they get 
credits from the government, while a systematic murder campaign 
has been launched against Kurdish partisans and businessmen. 
Crooks like Serafettin Elci `sit up and beg' for the money they 
receive from the government." 
  In the midst of such forceful political accusations, the 
formation of a separate moderate party by political circles 
known to be close to the "Kurdistan Socialist Party" (PSK) 
leader, Kemal Burkay, is considered important. 
  These political circles want to leave the Democracy party 
(DEP) and form their own party. It is not yet known what this 
party will be called, but it will soon make its appearance on 
the political scene. "We are not a Kurdish party. We are a 
`Turkic' party and Turkey needs our political views," said the 
speaker of the future party, Ibrahim Aksoy. 
  According to Aksoy, people from the Social Democrat People's 
Party (SHP) will also join their party. Aksoy identifies 
"constitutional citizenship" (national citizenship recognizing 
ethnic origin) as the most important principle guiding the party. 
  Although it is said that the new party will be a "Turkic" 
party, it seems that the majority of its members will be Kurds.

  [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that the Poised Hammer mandate has been extended, despite 
the fact that a majority of the people are against it. 
  Addressing the PP assembly group, Erbakan said the Poised 
Hammer forces are extending aid to the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] terror organization and to Armenia. He noted that 
these forces are stationed in Turkey not to defend northern 
Iraqis but to watch over U.S. interests in the Middle East. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] Some 70 to 80 percent of our 
citizens want these forces to leave Turkey. The administration 
is fulfilling the wishes of foreign forces, despite the will of 
the people and despite claims that there is democracy in Turkey. 
[end recording] 
  Commenting on the constitutional amendments, Erbakan said 
his 
party wants a laicism similar to that in Europe to be 
implemented in Turkey. Noting that constitutional amendments 
have been presented with the aim of covering up the 
deterioration in the economy, Erbakan added that the people 
want, above all, to be fed.

  [Excerpt] Turkish President Suleyman Demirel made new 
provocative statements today aboard the frigate from which he 
watched a Turkish military exercise in the Aegean. Mr. Demirel 
said: We wish that Greece would present Turkey with faits 
accomplis whose consequences Greece itself would not be able to 
address. 
  National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis talked this 
morning about Turkey creating a climate of artificial tension. 
  At the same time, in a letter to the Turkish president, 
President Konstandinos Karamanlis rejects his allegations about 
the training of terrorists in our country. Alkis Mallidhis has 
the following report. 
  [Begin recording] [Mallidhis] In his statement today, 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel raised the questions of 
territorial waters, the continental shelf, and even of the FIR 
[Flight Information Region]. However, he said that these 
questions should be resolved peacefully. Particularly on the 
territorial waters, Mr. Demirel claimed that if Greece extends 
them to 12 miles then Turkey would be cut off from the sea. 
Athens believes that Ankara is trying to create a climate of 
artificial tension for domestic reasons. 
  [Defense Minister Arsenis] We must not fall into the trap of 
those who want to create artificial tension between Greece and 
Turkey. It is well known that the Turkish Government has many 
domestic problems. These are their own problems and we should 
not play on their chess board. 
  [Mallidhis] At the same time, according to reliable reports, 
President Konstandinos Karamanlis today replied to the Turkish 
president's recent letter. President Karamanlis rejects 
allegations Mr. Demirel made in his letter about the training of 
terrorists in our country and points out that Greece condemns 
terrorism in whatever form it appears. Mr. Karamanlis further 
stressed that the creation of new problems between the two 
countries should be avoided so that a climate of mutual trust is 
created. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis will 
discuss with his U.S. counterpart defense aspects of Greek-U.S. 
relations and the question of air navigation in the Aegean which 
was the subject of recent remarks by the U.S. Secretary of 
State. Mr. Arsenis will begin a visit to the United States on 
Sunday [19 June] to attend an informal NATO conference. 
  The national defense minister stressed in a statement that 
Greek fighter aircraft, according to NATO regulations, must be 
armed if they intercept unidentified aircraft that violate the 
rules of air traffic in the Athens FIR [Flight Information 
Region] or violate national airspace. 
  On the subject of Mr. Warren Christopher's statement, the 
national defense minister said that anyone who wants the 
artificial tension that was recently created between Greece and 
Turkey to be defused should see who is doing the violations and 
infringements. 
  The national defense minister referred to the Turkish 
maneuvers Sea Wolf and Efes-94, which are being held in the 
eastern Aegean, as well as the efforts by the Turkish press 
because of these maneuvers to depict Greek-Turkish relations as 
tense, and he pointed out that these maneuvers were scheduled 
some time ago and, as is natural, they are being followed by our 
country as Turkey also follows the Greek maneuvers.

<F P=106> [The "Views" column: "Will We Learn?"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, being 
consistent with the always irreproachable U.S. behavior toward 
Turkey, said in Istanbul--on the sidelines of the NATO 
conference--that the Greek military aircraft, that are 
intercepting Turkish aircraft when they violate the Greek 
airspace, should be disarmed. 
  According to Mr. Christopher and the traditionally 
pro-Turkish U.S. policy, the continuous violations and 
infringements by Turkish military aircraft in the Aegean do not 
cause any problem but their interception by armed Greek aircraft 
does! Fortunately, he did not ask us not to intercept them 
either. 
  Of course--as the foreign news agencies reported--[Greek 
Foreign Minister] Mr. Karolos Papoulias told Mr. Christopher not 
to interfere in Greek affairs and said that "no such issue would 
be raised if the violations had not taken place." 
  As far as Mr. Christopher is concerned, it appears that the 
threats by [Turkish Prime Minister] Mrs. Tansu Ciller about a 
Turkish landing on the Greek islands do not cause any problem. 
According to U.S. policy, there is neither a problem with the 
Turkish occupation in Cyprus, nor is there any evidence of it 
regarding the oppression of the Greek minority in Albania, nor 
is there any actual problem with the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue. 
  Being aware of U.S. policy, which demands concessions from 
Greece, and being even more aware of Turkish provocative games, 
threats, and alleged retractions, we talk about "examples of 
detente" in the escalation, and the government spokesman says 
that "the government believes that the statements by Mr. Hikmet 
Cetin are expressed carefully and moderately." 
  However, the Turkish prime minister is neither careful nor 
moderate when MILLIYET confirms that 15 days ago she also 
reiterated the threats about landing on Greek islands. 
  After all, when will we learn that Turkey remains 
steadfastly 
intransigent and provocative toward Greece and, moreover, that 
this Turkish stance is encouraged by the U.S. policy? 
  We must learn this in order to stop believing in the 
so-called good offices of the American mediators and the other 
recommendations and "friendly" openings. Unless Mr. Andreas 
Papandreou is aware of other things that the other 
Greeks--people, parties, and press--do not know.... [ellipses as

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Greek Reaction"] </F>
  [Text] The Greek Government has so far been reacting to the 
increasing Turkish provocations with most enduring coolness and 
moderation, which give rise to doubts in a large segment of the 
public. This is because PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], 
when it was an opposition party, always criticized the 
nationalism of the ruling party and strongly condemned every 
moderate tactic regarding Ankara, even using such terms as 
"national underestimation," "betrayal of national rights," and 
so forth. 
  This column merely notes this inconsistency without, of 
course, impeaching the official opposition under the excuse that 
it does not follow the tactics of its basic political opponent. 
This is because our foreign policy must be charted and 
implemented over and above any party antagonism. In this 
specific case the motives and goals of the Turkish 
provocativeness are known. The Turkish Government is now facing 
a major domestic problem. The Kurdish uprising has developed 
into an endless civil war, whose casualty totals over the past 
decade have reached 12,000 dead! 
  During the same period the Kemalist element--that is the 
military establishment who consented to a controlled 
democratization of that country--has suffered a rapid loss of 
its strength and glory. On the other hand, the Islamic spirit 
has revived and expanded, as a result of which the 
trustworthiness and prestige of the official Turkish leadership 
is being doubted in the European and, more generally, the 
Western sphere... [ellipses as published] 
  Therefore, a faltering Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is 
anxiously seeking ways to rally the nation together and to 
create concord by resorting to well-known methods--that is, to 
create artificial tensions in the foreign policy sector and then 
embark on acts of bullying (in Turkish daylik) with regard to 
nonexistent threats against her country. Obviously, Mrs. Ciller 
and her associates feel that such "appropriate" tactics could be 
implemented in the most (internationally) painless and 
(internally) beneficial manner only in regard to the 
Greek-Turkish disputes. 
  In the foreign policy sector, coolness, wisdom, and 
tolerance 
result primarily from a feeling of supremacy. On the contrary, 
insolent provocativeness and pointless aggressiveness in most 
cases are an expression of weakness, despondency, or even panic. 
So, the extent to which the Greek reaction toward the Turkish 
provocations has developed, based on the above-mentioned facts, 
is certainly justified. It remains for this reaction to be 
proved right during the development and the outcome of this 
specific "crisis"....

<F P=106> [Paul Cambon article: "What Future for the Paris-Bonn </F>
Axis?"] 
  [Text] What are the prospects for the Paris-Bonn axis 
following the European elections? The Franco-German desire for 
harmonization remains intact, but the differences in approach 
persist with a view to the major date of the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference aimed at drawing up the initial 
assessment of the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  Are the very different results of the European elections in 
France and Germany likely to influence the strength of the close 
cooperation between Paris and Bonn? The question is 
interesting, but remains purely speculative. In any event Bonn 
is merely observing that the votes received by the parties 
supporting the European Union [EU] as stipulated by the 
Maastricht Treaty added up to a generally higher score (a veil 
is being drawn over the abstention rate) than that recorded by 
the "yes" camp in the September 1992 referendum. 
  However, German diplomatic circles note, the emergence of 
the 
De Villiers [head of anti-Maastricht list] phenomenon is being 
closely watched. Not so much with regard to its possible impact 
on EU policy, but especially with regard to its influence in the 
political game within the existing French Government majority. 
"It is easy to imagine the deputy for Vendee trying to 
influence a particular right-wing candidate in the presidential 
elections to give his major European options a more critical 
bent," a Bonn diplomat said. 
  We will have to wait and see whether this hypothesis can be 
verified. Franco-German relations, as they have been designed 
and have developed since the signing of the Elysee Treaty in 
January 1963, are a factor that cannot be ignored: The 
Paris-Bonn axis is a reality. Nobody on either side of the 
Rhine dares to cast doubt on it, because it has asserted itself 
and seems more vital than ever to meet the huge new challenges 
which have been facing Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
the emancipation of the East European countries, and the 
collapse of Communism in Moscow. 
  Despite occasional vicissitudes and frictions in relations 
between the French president and the German chancellor (which 
was the case between Georges Pompidou and Willy Brandt), the 
past has shown that the Franco-German accord on promoting 
European construction has generally worked well. Even if it has 
often been the subject of criticism which is at times fierce. 
"The French and Germans can sometimes achieve the impossible. 
And often they do not please anybody," one of Helmut Kohl's 
close aides commented half ironically and half bitterly, and he 
added: "Our cooperation is certainly not perfect. It is still 
exemplary." At the Elysee [presidential office], in Francois 
Mitterrand's entourage, the same tone is taken, stressing that 
"the convergence in Franco-German approaches is neither natural 
nor spontaneous." Clearly, any agreement between Paris and Bonn 
is the fruit of long and sometimes difficult negotiations, and a 
vital compromise. 
  From 1 July the Germans and French will have successive 
six-month terms as EU president. Even before the 12 June 
election, speculation was rife both in Paris and Bonn about 
achieving the greatest possible harmonization of the two 
presidencies. Some idealists or at all events extreme optimists 
talked of the possibility of a "joint presidency." The idea did 
not gain ground and it seems that each has returned to 
symbolically less spectacular but probably more effective ideas. 
However, there is one certainty: Many nuances and many 
differences remain between France and Germany on the major 
issues awaiting the EU, not in the immediate future but at all 
events by 1996, the year of the Intergovernmental Conference 
responsible for making the initial assessment and assessing the 
prospects for the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty. 
  These differences relate both to the nature of the European 
institutional reforms (although each recognizes the need for 
them), and the future of European construction, more 
particularly, its aims and its expansion plans toward East 
Europe which, of course, nobody disputes but which nobody at 
present sees very clearly. 
  Helmut Kohl is a highly convinced and unreserved supporter 
of 
European construction. For almost ideological reasons. As a 
Rhinelander, close to France, he experienced the sufferings of 
war as a child. As a German, having long suffered the division 
of his country, he could not conceive of Germany's new-found 
unity other than in the framework of the kind of free Europe 
desired and launched by Konrad Adenauer and General de Gaulle. 
Helmut Kohl is a fervent integrationist. His European 
convictions are also based on a fully egalitarian democratic 
concept. This remark applies to his concept of strengthening 
the powers of the European state institutions, namely the 
Brussels Commission and the Strasbourg Parliament. Paris' 
desire for integration is not in doubt, but, according to its 
present state of thinking, it wants to see the powers of the 
Council of Ministers strengthened and expanded. However, in the 
upper echelons of the French state, it is impossible to detect 
any very ardent enthusiasm for conferring a key role on the 
European deputies. 
  There is still some division between France and Germany on 
the currently rather abstract link being made between expansion 
and deepening. The French take a Cartesian attitude and more 
readily place the emphasis on the second element, whereas the 
Germans do not see any fundamental contradictions. Quite the 
reverse. 
  The fact remains that, over the past 12 months, the subject 
of EU expansion, not only to the Central and East European 
countries but also to Romania and Bulgaria and to the three 
Baltic countries and Slovenia, has taken on a scale which some 
people in France had clumsily underestimated. But even if the 
integration of these various countries which have come in from 
the cold is a matter of years, Germany, given its geographical 
position, anxious not to be the last country in the East to be a 
member of a military organization (NATO), very rapidly saw the 
risks of a "gray area" grouping several countries between West 
Europe and a Russia threatened with political and economic 
instability. This same concern is shared in Warsaw, Budapest, 
and Prague. To the extent that, over the last few months of 
last year, Poland and Hungary requested integration into NATO. 
They have done so in vain so far, but the future remains open. 
And these same countries have also officially applied for EU 
membership. 
  The facts are there, pressing. "France and Germany must 
consider a planned and coordinated action," the Quai d'Orsay 
[French Foreign Ministry] readily says. But for what Europe and 
for what expansion which, it is feared, may be synonymous with 
dilution? Such a serious question deserves a vast debate. A 
variable-geometry Europe or an all-European free trade area? 
Chancellor Kohl seems hostile to the second option. However, 
it is not certain that he is a warm supporter of the first. 
  However, French diplomacy seems to be "working" more and 
more 
on the basis of this variable-geometry Europe, a formula which 
is not new and which, at least in the monetary sphere, had 
supporters in Germany. At the time there was talk of a 
"concentric Europe." However, it is important not to confuse 
things. The challenges facing the EU are of several kinds: the 
common foreign and security policy, economic convergence, and 
monetary union. 
  Although it is clear, but not easy, that an expanded Europe 
must find the vital common denominator in the foreign policy and 
security spheres, it is equally obvious that the huge gulf which 
now separates the European Twelve or Sixteen from the fairly 
long-term candidates for membership is not about to be bridged. 
An illustration of this is that the per capita GDP among the 
Twelve is currently $18,600 per year. It is only $3,000 for the 
Visegrad group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) 
and $1,000 for Romania. And, according to expert forecasts, it 
will take these countries a good 20 years to achieve 75 percent 
of the EU's GDP. Provided that throughout this period the growth 
differential for these East European countries is 4 percent 
higher than the economic expansion recorded within the EU. 
  Expansion also implies a doubling of the Twelve's budgetary 
contribution. A country like Spain would become a net 
contributor. How can it be ensured that, faced with the scale of 
such a financial commitment, immediate national interests do not 
rapidly resurface? In Germany, for instance, during the election 
campaign for the European elections, a good number of people 
spoke out, especially among Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, 
demanding a review of the German budget contribution. The 
argument put forward is that Germany, the EU's leading net 
contributor, saw its annual per capita GDP fall from first to 
sixth place among the Twelve under the effect of reunification. 
"The thread of voluntarism must be taken up again," according 
to one of Francois Mitterrand's close aides, who also describes 
the "Maastricht Treaty as a forge for very tough metals." The 
Maastricht Treaty would therefore become "a formidable tool" for 
an ambitious plan. This is the conviction cherished by the 
French president and the German chancellor, who are its 
initiators. Once the parliamentary elections in Germany and the 
presidential elections in France are over, the future will say 
whether the Franco-German European faith is still as complete. 
We can hazard a bet: We do not expect it to be altered too 
much by the weight of reality and perhaps also the urgency to 
find a solution.

  [Begin Claes recording] The question of personalities has 
never interested us. What interests us most -- and here we have

second, has the means to conduct a monetary, budgetary, and

the economic reconstruction of the country to take place, having 
as its first aim to improve the lot of the Zairean people. [end

<F P=106> [By James Hardy, PRESS ASSOCIATION News lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] World powers will not bullied by threats of war from 
North Korea into backing down on international obligations, 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd warned tonight. 
  He denounced North Korean communist dictator Kim Il Sung as 
one of a brand of "unpredictable tyrants with chips on their 
shoulders" who threatened post-Cold War peace. 
  And he told foreign diplomats in London that unless a 
lasting 
peace was reached in Bosnia "in the next couple of months" 
United Nations troops--including the British ground force--might 
be forced to pull out. 
  In a grim assessment of world affairs, Mr Hurd gave a 
chilling warning that the cloudless summer of 1914 ended in the 
disaster of the First World War. 
  "This is not 1914, but it will not be an easy summer. Our 
skills, patience and resolve will be tested," he said. 
  But as North Korea lurched relentlessly towards violent 
confrontation over allowing inspection of its nuclear 
facilities, Mr Hurd warned that the international community 
would not be intimidated. 
  The United Nations Security Council would not be deterred 
from carrying out its international duties and would offer a 
"resolute response" to North Korean sabre-rattling. 
  "Security is only possible in a world where weapons of mass 
destruction are not widely available," he said at the annual 
Diplomatic Banquet. 
  "Unpredictable tyrants with chips on their shoulders must 
not 
be allowed to flout their treaty obligations--but this is 
exactly what North Korea has been doing for the last 18 months." 
  Britain would back Security Council measures to persuade the 
North Koreans to comply with their nuclear obligations. 
  "They should understand that compliance is in their own 
interests. But they should be under no illusion--we will not be 
deterred by threats of war from doing what is necessary, 
including extensive sanctions. Any unwise move by North Korea 
will be met with a resolute response." 
  Mr Hurd told the banquet held at the Foreign Office that 
North Korea was only one of a number of potential flashpoints 
across the world--and time was rapidly running out to reach a 
lasting peace in Bosnia. 
  The ceasefire was "fragile and threatened" by people who 
thought they could gain more from war than peace. 
  Britain and France remained deeply concerned for the safety 
of their troops as Russia faced pressures to give unquestioning 
support to the Serbs and the United States considered lifting 
its arms embargo. 
  The pressures at work were "understandable but dangerous" 
and 
had far-reaching consequences for the UN Protection Forces 
(UNPROFOR). 
  "They make it inevitable that Bosnia faces a fork in the 
path," he said. 
  "Either there is a settlement soon, in the next couple of 
months, or there is a real risk that the arms embargo will be 
lifted, weaponry will flood in to both sides, UNPROFOR's 
position will become impossible and will have to withdraw." 
  The war could then spread unchecked into neighbouring 
regions.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl praised the 
reconciliatory role of Moscow's State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
in Russian politics. According to government spokesman Dieter 
Vogel, during talks with Rybkin in Bonn Kohl also stressed 
Germany's "energetic interest" in the continuation of the 
democratic and market economic reform process in Russia on the 
basis of stable framework conditions. 
  The two politicians agreed "that bilateral relations are 
free 
from fundamental and insoluble problems." This positive 
starting point should be used and further developed in the 
interest of the two countries and all of Europe. The chairman 
of the Russian State Duma also plans to meet Bundestag President 
Rita Suessmuth and Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker 
today.

  [Text] Paris, June 15 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe called Wednesday [15 June] for the West to take a 
strong line with North Korea for its defiance over nuclear 
inspections, warning that the region was a "powder-keg." 
  Arguing that attempts at negotiation with Pyongyang had 
failed, he said: "We are insisting that the West unite behind a 
strong position because the risks are considerable. If we 
continue to let North Korea develop its nuclear arms potential, 
it risks destabilizing the whole of the Korean peninsula and the 
region," he said, after a meeting with the Foreign Affairs 
Commission of the National Assembly. 
  "Seoul is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the demarcation 
line, 
so there are all the elements of a powder-keg," he said. "We 
need a rapid and clear display of the determination of the 
international community," he said, adding that it could not "let 
North Korea continue to violate its international commitments." 
  He spoke as the United States prepares to present a 
resolution seeking UN sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] The UN Security Council this evening renewed the 
mandate of UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] and, at the same time, 
stressed the urgent need to implement the confidence-building 
measures. 
  Resolution No. 927, which was approved unanimously, stresses 
that the Security Council will proceed with a full review of the 
situation, including the UN role in Cyprus, within the framework 
of its examination of the secretary general's 31 May report. It 
also calls on all interested parties to be committed to a 
substantial reduction in the number of foreign troops in Cyprus 
and in the arms expenditures of the Republic of Cyprus, in order 
to further the restoration of trust between the parties and as a 
first step for the withdrawal of the non-Cypriot forces as 
stipulated in the [Butrus-Ghali] set of ideas. 
  The Security Council also notes in its resolution that it 
will continue to examine the secretary general's report and that 
additional information is expected. 
  The Pakistani delegate claimed in his speech, without making 
any reference to our side, that the Turkish Cypriot leadership 
demonstrated political will to make progress in the 
confidence-building measures on the questions of Famagusta and 
the Nicosia Airport as well as for an overall settlement of the 
problem. In order to support his views, the Pakistani delegate 
referred to the acceptance in principle by Rauf Denktas of the 
secretary general's report of July 1993. He referred to the 
agreement that Denktas concluded with the United Nations in 
Vienna under the condition that the agreement would be 
incorporated into the secretary general's latest report.

  [Text] Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat Ataman has 
expressed regret over the nuclear experiments being conducted by 
the PRC when work on a treaty banning nuclear experiments is 
gaining momentum. 
  Speaking at a news conference today, Ataman expressed 
Turkey's belief that it is necessary to sign a comprehensive 
international treaty banning nuclear experiments, which have 
many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the 
viewpoint of the future of humanity. 
  Ataman said: 
  We regret to learn that the PRC has, in the last few days, 
conducted another nuclear experiment when work on a treaty 
banning nuclear experiments is gaining momentum and when 
countries with nuclear capabilities are taking steps to make 
their unilateral decisions to halt these experiments permanent. 
  Turkey believes in the necessity of signing a comprehensive 
international treaty -- which will be a significant 
complementary factor in helping the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty attain its goals -- banning nuclear experiments, which 
have many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the 
viewpoint of the future of humanity. Turkey further notes that 
it is doing all it can on the issue and finds it beneficial to 
stress that it is deeply concerned and displeased about any kind 
of behavior that might endanger the promising work being 
accomplished on this path.

  [Text] The Belgian ambassador in Paris is trying to get 
clarifications on the French proposal for international military 
intervention in Rwanda aimed at putting an end to the massacres. 
However, Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has already 
defined the main lines of Belgium's position: There is no 
question of sending Belgian troops to Rwanda again. Belgium is 
hated by the Hutu extremists and the 10 Belgian paratroopers 
killed in April have not been forgotten. Nevertheless, Belgium 
could supply France with military and logistical aid. Our 
country is thoroughly familiar with the infrastructure of Rwanda.

<F P=106> [Article signed GH: "Belgium To Give 100 million Belgian </F>
Francs in Emergency Aid for Rwanda"] 
  [Text] Tomorrow [17 June] the cabinet will approve the 
earmarking of 100 million Belgian francs [BFr] to alleviate the 
misery of people hit by the Rwandan civil war. Naturally in the 
first place this will concern Rwandan refugees, but Tanzania, 
which has the largest refugee camp on its territory, can also 
count on aid. 
  The aid has already been approved in principle, but will now 
be paid out in practice. Four organizations (Doctors Without 
Frontiers, Caritas, the Red Cross, and Oxfam-Belgium) will 
assign the funds. Since they have already incurred considerable 
expenses before the money has reached their bank accounts, the 
government is also promising to reimburse any bank interest 
charges. 
  In addition to the large amount of BFr100 million in direct 
aid, it has also been decided to release BFr14 million in order 
to rebuild Tanzania's food stocks. These strategic stocks have 
recently fallen very sharply. The aim is to supply the 
equivalent of some 4,000 tonnes of grain which will be used for 
both the Tanzanian population and Rwandan refugees. 
  A similar amount will be spent to dig water wells in the 
regions where the refugees are located. By sending aid to the 
local population and the refugees, the organizations hope to 
avoid tension between the two groups. 
  The State Secretariat for Development Cooperation has 
announced that further emergency aid will be approved as soon as 
new project proposals have been received. The money will be 
taken out of the existing emergency aid fund (which increased to 
BFr500 million in 1994) and the structural aid fund to Rwanda. 
The State Secretariat believes that this trend toward increased 
emergency aid spending is regrettable, but that it can not be 
avoided at this moment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr Clarke's Optimism"] </F>
  [Text] The Chancellor of the Exchequer cannot have been 
displeased by the statistical auspices on the eve of his annual 
Mansion House speech last night. A raft of encouraging numbers 
shows unemployment down, inflation still subdued and wage 
increases in modest decline, after some months of worrying 
increase. These figures served to emphasise Mr Kenneth Clarke's 
message that a period of sustained noninflationary growth is now 
in prospect. 
  Every Chancellor must juggle two audiences -- the voters and 
the markets. Conventional wisdom holds that their interests -- 
and especially their ideas on public spending -- inevitably 
diverge. Last night, with several years to go before the next 
electoral reckoning, there was no doubt which audience Mr Clarke 
was looking harder at. Particularly after the recent turbulence 
in the world's bond markets, a man with a 38 billion pound 
deficit to fund cannot take chances with the City. Growth, he 
assured his listeners, will be responsible. Tax cuts were 
promised, but with strict qualifications: "low expenditure is 
the key to lower taxes"; taxes will be cut again "only when we 
can afford to do so and not before we can afford to do so." 
  Tax cuts are, of course, what many in his panicky party 
would 
most like to hear about, but the days are gone when a Government 
could buy easy popularity with a shilling off a packet of 20 and 
a penny off income tax. Over the past five years the public has 
had to relearn the hard way the lessons of the 1970's, that 
inflation and excessive deficits are painful and dangerous. In 
that sense, the gap between the financial markets and the wider 
world has narrowed. Tax cuts which the markets deem 
irresponsible would soon prove politically counter-productive. 
Yet it remains arguable that, unless the Conservatives can 
deliver or credibly promise some reduction in taxation before 
the next election, they will offer little if anything to 
differentiate themselves from a refurbished Labour Party. 
  The question for Mr Clarke, therefore, is how genuine scope 
can be found for reducing some of the extra imposts with which 
he and his predecessor have burdened us. On this, the 
Chancellor had little to say beyond reaffirming his aim of 
getting public expenditure back beneath 40 per cent of Gross 
National Product in the medium term. On present plans, that is 
not due to happen during this parliament. 
  Here, the spotlight switches to Mr Michael Portillo, Chief 
Secretary to the Treasury and darling of the tax-cutting Tory 
Right. Mr Portillo is in charge of public expenditure. He is 
also charged with carrying out "fundamental reviews" of various 
departments' spending -- including the massive 80 billion pound 
Social Security budget. If meaningful savings are to be found, 
they will have to come through these reviews. So far, ominously 
little has been heard of them, either officially or via 
anguished leaks from their targets. 
  In most respects, Mr Clarke's optimism last night was well 
founded. The economy is again growing reasonably strongly. 
Thanks to the supply side reforms of the past 15 years, we are 
better able than most of our European partners to face the 
changes and challenges that confront all developed countries. 
With a semi-independent Bank of England anxious to win its 
spurs, it should even be possible to keep inflation under 
control. But, if Mr Clarke wishes to present himself at the 
next election as the man who reduced taxes as well as increased 
them, he and Mr Portillo will have to show more mettle in the 
forthcoming public expenditure round than they have so far 
managed, and it is difficult to be optimistic that they will 
succeed.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with U.S. movie director Allan </F>
Francovich by Giovanni Porta in London; date not given: 
"Explosive Scenario"] 
  [Text] The skies over Lockerbie, Scotland, 21 December 
1988: A bomb hidden in the baggage compartment of the Pan Am 
Boeing 747 en route from London to New York explodes, destroying 
the aircraft. In the disaster 259 passengers and crew members 
lost their lives and 11 Scottish citizens were killed by the 
flaming wreckage. In 1990, after lengthy investigations, the 
Governments of Britain and the United States formally accused 
two Libyan agents of organizing the attack. The Libyan trail is 
still considered today as the only valid one supported by proof. 
Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's government, isolated by the 
international community's condemnation and subjected to an 
economic embargo by the United Nations, has always tried to 
prove its innocence. It does not appear to have succeeded in 
the attempt, despite millions of dollars spent on propaganda 
initiatives. 
  Today, a new initiative which can be traced back to the 
authorities in Tripoli proposes a disconcerting version of the 
events, which has already sparked a fiery controversy and looks 
set to unhinge many certainties. 
  The rendezvous was in a small Italian cafe in Soho, London, 
against a backdrop of blue-movie cinemas and small antique 
shops. Allan Francovich, an Italian-Croatian-American producer 
and director specializing in controversial investigative fims on 
the dark world of secret services -- "A Company Business," on 
the mysteries of the CIA; the TV series on Gladio, NATO's secret 
organization, broadcast by the BBC, which caused a huge stir -- 
chose this anonymous venue for the interview since it was safe 
from prying eyes and ears. For some weeks he has felt that he 
is in danger: The phones in the headquarters of Hemar 
Enterprises Inc., his production company, appear to have been 
bugged "by the British secret services"; the director's whole 
team of operators, analysts, and research people is apparently 
being followed by plain-clothes agents; he himself claims to 
have received death threats. 
  Allan Francovich's secret is sealed in a video cassette 
containing a new "startling" TV documentary on the Lockerbie 
disaster, with the vaguely literary title of "The Maltese Double 
Cross." This is a tape which nobody has yet seen -- "It will be 
ready in five weeks' time" -- but which is already at the center 
of a raging controversy in Britain and the United States: The 
government in London is threatening to ban distribution; the 
British TV Channel 4, which intended to broadcast the 
investigation, has unexpectedly severed all contacts with 
Francovich; the U.S. judicial authorities are on the trail of 
two of the director's closest staff, in hiding in West Europe; 
the families of the 270 people who died in the disaster are 
quarreling openly, split between supporters -- led by Briton Jim 
Swire, a relation of one of the victims -- and opponents -- 
lawyer Lee Kreindler, defending the interests of the U.S. 
families -- of the film. 
  The controversy exploded in November 1993 following a 
FINANCIAL TIMES report on the origin of the 633,000 pounds (some 
1.5 billion lire) allocated for the making of the film. It 
transpired that Hemar, a company set up on the British Virgin 
Isles solely for this purpose, was backed by a consortium with 
Libyan connections: the conglomerate Lonrho, controlled by the 
controversial finance mogul "Tiny" Rowland, and LAFICO, the 
Tripoli government's powerful holding company. 
  Allan Francovich did not want to reveal the "plot" of his 
film, "a preview screening of which will be shown to the 
relations of the British victims." But in the course of our 
conversation, he ended up by divulging the trails he followed in 
his investigations. The main sources he used for his 
"fieldwork" were: "The Trail of the Octopus," a book by Lester 
Coleman, a former U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA] agent, 
who is interviewed at length in the film; a 27-page confidential 
report (which PANORAMA was able to view) commissioned by Pan Am 
from a private investigation agency, Interfor Inc., owned by 
Juval Aviv, an Israeli citizen; "first-hand" information 
provided by Oswald Le Winter (alias Ibrahim Razin, alias 
Professor Sermit), a shady character convicted for false witness 
in the United States and a former international drug smuggler 
"on behalf of the CIA and Colonel Oliver North"; and 
confidential information "obtained by our contacts in the secret 
services of various Arab countries and West and East Europe."

  The complicated version which "The Maltese Double Cross" 
would have us believe goes something like this: The bomb which 
destroyed the Pan Am Boeing on 21 December 1988 was not shipped 
from Malta, via Frankfurt, by Libyan agents Lamine Khalifah 
Fahimah and 'Abd-al Basit 'Ali al-Miqrahi: The evidence 
gathered on the island against the two was apparently 
"skillfully fabricated." The device is said to have been 
identical to those hidden in certain tape recorders and 
electronic apparatus discovered by the German police in a base 
belonging to the PPLF-GC (Palestine Popular Liberation 
Front--General Command) in Duesseldorf on 26 October 1988. The 
bomb -- 300 gms of Semtex explosive with a timer manufactured by 
a firm called Mebo AG in Zurich -- was apparently placed inside 
a Toshiba tape recorder hidden inside an unaccompanied suitcase 
shipped from Frankfurt. The timer, an MST-13 manufactured by 
Swiss expert Edwin Bollier, may have been made available to the 
PPLF-GC by the East German security service Stasi, a theory put 
forward in a recent article in the weekly DER SPIEGEL. The 
suitcase was apparently part of one of the "controlled drug 
shipments" customarily organized by the CIA and the DIA between 
the Middle East and the United States in support of their own 
fifth columns in the Arab world and terrorist circles. The 
extremist Palestinian grouping led by Ahmad Jibril, with Syrian 
connections, appears to have discovered the existence of this 
traffic (tolerated by the German authorities, which did not 
subject the drug suitcases to the usual checks) and to have 
taken advantage of this knowledge to place the bomb; the action 
was apparently carried out, with Syria's assent, to the order of 
the government in Tehran in retaliation for the downing of an 
Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf by the U.S. frigate Vincennes 
on 3 July 1988. 
  Before the attack -- according to Francovich and his team -- 
the U.S. secret services received "at least 16 danger warnings, 
some of which were extremely detailed," from Israel's Mosad and 
another anonymous source. Nobody did anything to stop the Pan 
Am aircraft or to warn the passengers -- or at least the 
"ordinary" passengers: In fact, a number of important South 
African politicians were due to board flight PA 103 on 21 
December, "but they were obviously warned because they canceled 
their reservations at the last minute." 
  "The CIA's men were in Lockerbie a mere two hours after the 
disaster, frantically searching the wreckage," Francovich 
explained. "They were coordinated by Vincent Cannistraro, a 
well-known expert in disinformation operations and one of the 
originators of the plan to eliminate al-Qadhdhafi." Cannistraro 
"is still today at the head of the CIA team entrusted with the 
investigations, and he is one of the leading supporters of the 
Libyan trail." 
<H5>  New Backers </H5>
  Today, following the press leaks on the film's backers, 
Lonrho and its partners have apparently withdrawn their support 
and sold Hemar, along with the film rights. "I have been 
contacted by new backers," Francovich said, "bankers, men who 
have worked with Armand Hammer and Bernie Cornfeld and who want 
to take over. Director Oliver Stone is interested in producing 
the documentary." 
  "Our enemies," the director continued, "are afraid of the 
terrible truths which we have discovered and can prove." "The 
Libyan trail is certainly the most convenient and the easiest to 
get international public opinion to swallow," the director 
explained, "but we want to know why, in all these years, the 
governments which want to bring the two Libyan citizens to trial 
have never published the evidence they claim to have against 
them. No serious investigation has ever been conducted into the 
Lockerbie disaster. For the first time, our investigation 
reconstructs the events which led up to the Jumbo's explosion; 
it sheds light on the key characters involved in the attack, and 
on the men from the CIA, the DIA, and the German and Middle East 
secret services who have taken part in directing the scent 
against the Libyans." 
  If "The Maltese Double Cross" ever gets shown to the public, 
it certainly will not quench the desire for justice in the 270 
victim's relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Kai </F>
Diekmann and Paul C. Martin; place and date not given: "Mr. 
Berlusconi, What Do You Like About Germany?"] 
  [Text] [BILD] Prime Minister, what should the new Italy 
be like? 
  [Berlusconi] The new Italy will be a happy, more just 
country that is in a position to deal with its affairs better. 
Italians have an inclination toward the practical and can also 
imagine their future. That means they can dream with their eyes 
open. 
  In other words, the new Italy must demonstrate pragmatism in 
solving its problems, but at the same time, it cannot lose the 
ability to develop utopias and possess visions. 
  [BILD] Germany is the first country that you are paying an 
official visit to. 
  [Berlusconi] There is, of course, a special relationship 
between Italy and Germany. It is a question of deep ties, of 
established traditions, mutual contacts, and common cultural 
origins that have their roots in Christian values. 
  Our economic ties are striking proof of that: Ties between 
our companies are particularly intensive. Siemens has just 
bought 50 percent of "Italtel." There is also a significant 
Italian presence in the eastern German laender. 
  What links us above all is a common, firmly established 
belief in ideals and democratic patterns of behavior. That is 
how we triumphed over communism and that is what led to the 
reunification of Germany. These ideals and patterns of behavior 
have bolstered our determination with regard to intolerance, 
racism, and totalitarianism. 
  [BILD] What do you particularly like about Germany? 
  [Berlusconi] To my mind, the most attractive thing about 
Germany is the mixture of the old and the new. A great 
classical culture reflected in your exceptional countryside, 
your geographical landscapes, and your cultural greatness. At 
the same time, some of your cities are modern machines that 
produce work, prosperity, as well as science and technology at 
the highest possible level. 
  What has always impressed me about the speeches I have heard 
when I visited your country as a businessman or tourist is your 
sensitivity regarding the environment. One can see that this 
sensitivity has very deep roots. 
  [BILD] Why have you made neo-fascists ministers in your 
government? Reservations are also being voiced about that in 
Germany. 
  [Berlusconi] There are no neo-fascists in my government. 
The ministers from the National Alliance have nothing to do 
with fascism. It is enough to read their biographies and ideas. 
They are firmly anchored in democracy. The party they come 
from rejected a nostalgic attitude toward its roots years ago. 
  [BILD] There are problems with militant right-wing radicals 
throughout Europe. 
  [Berlusconi] Right-wing extremism is a problem that has 
nothing to do with the Italian Government. It is a serious 
problem and it worries me as well as the German chancellor 
  It is intolerable that 50 years after the defeat of European 
fascists, nationalism, racism, hostility toward foreigners, and 
anti-Semitism have appeared once again. 
  I hope that a new climate in Europe, developed by its 
leaders 
at the urging of the people, will cause these old ideological 
phantoms to disappear; phantoms that have been fed by the 
economic and social crises that we have experienced over several 
years.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Palombelli: "Berlusconi: Now the Target </F>
Is Bossi"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Clarification: a key word, borrowed, or 
inherited (with all the consequent ambiguity) from the First 
Republic. [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi called for this 
clarification, in his usual tone, which allows for no 
objections, acting since Sunday evening [12 June] like the 
leader of what will become the single party of the center-right. 
"There is only one thing that I can say: As things stand, 
there must be a clarification, first and foremost within the 
League," the prime minister replied to a journalist who tried to 
goad him with [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi's latest 
outbursts. In fact Berlusconi is aiming directly to separate 
the League's two leaders. On one side the "reasonable" 
[Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni, his deputy at the Palazzo 
Chigi [government seat] (and to think that until a few weeks ago 
he was averring: "Rather than allow a League member to become 
interior minister, I will drop everything..."). And on the 
other, the unpredictable Bossi. 
  An attack on the League for the sake of necessary 
"governability" and the essential "clarity" between government 
partners. This is Forza Italia's latest task. The successful 
attack will be followed by another strategy: first, an 
electoral reform to introduce a pure single-candidate system, 
(that is, without the 25 percent elected proportionally) with a 
single round; then, the building of the single party, led, of 
course, by supreme leader Silvio Berlusconi. Defense Minister 
Cesare Previti told LA REPUBBLICA: "I dream of seeing a great 
party united under the same name...." After the elections the 
members of the team have set to work. And the first step toward 
what Maroni described as "a three-way integration of Forza 
Italia, the National Alliance, and the League" is the exclusion 
of the restless Bossi. The prime minister's political adviser, 
Domenico Mennitti, explained: "The balance of forces has 
changed; the European elections obviously clarified any 
uncertainties about the identity of the majority's linchpin. In 
March we were blood donors, but now... The real problem is that 
the League has already performed its tasks: It has brought down 
the old system and brought federalism into Italian politics." 
  Mennitti's theorizing continued: "The fact is that the great 
political earthquake is still under way: The country's 
political geography has not yet been established. We will see a 
great many more changes both on the Right and on the Left... 
With a pure single-candidate system, the cake will be cut in 
two, and there will be many surprises." Could Bossi become a 
leader of the progressive alignment? "Why not? He has great 
political flexibility, but he is someone who has to operate on 
his own: He is irritated by negotiations, mediation; he is 
someone committed to struggle.... For the present, however, it 
seems to me that he is merely creating great ideological 
confusion: Liberalism and laborism are not the same thing. 
When he has clarified his ideas, we will all understand things 
better. At last we now have before us a year in which to 
ponder, a year without elections. But let this be clear: We do 
not want to reform a party, but to govern an alignment." To 
this end Mennitti is planning a conference and a magazine. 
  To govern an alignment. In which there will be room also for 
"Catholics, nonconfessionals, socialist-liberals." This idea 
horrifies League minister Francesco Speroni: "I would like to 
know from Mr. Berlusconi whether that gang of former Christian 
Democrat and former Socialist scoundrels that are trying to join 
with him are doing so on their own initiative or with his 
consent... But as far as we are concerned, he can be reassured: 
There has already been a clarification, and it is a positive 
one. If he is demanding it as government leader, he is entitled 
to do so. But it is incorrect for the leader of a political 
force to demand to know who is in charge in another party. He 
cannot ask whether Bossi or Maroni is in charge here." And yet 
this does indeed seem to be the question of the moment. This, 
as long as the two League leaders are not planning to share the 
roles, in the hope of causing difficulties for their allies, 
breaking free with a superlative "one-two." Those who know them 
well rule out the possibility of rifts between them. And 
yesterday the interior minister himself shelved the issue until 
Sunday [19 June]: "In Pontida [League rally venue] there are 
never any pauses for reflection for the Northern League. In 
Pontida there is always a return to the attack. The same will 
apply next Sunday... I think it will be a very interesting 
meeting, useful in order to see where the League will go in the 
near future." Some say, with Berlusconi. And others, such as 
the League's lower house floor leader, Pierluigi Petrini, see it 
"on the Left side" in the near future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on press conference by Northern League </F>
Secretary Umberto Bossi on 15 June; place not given: "Bossi: 
Who Cares?"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "Oh, yes? Who cares?" This is how [League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi dismissed [Prime Minister] Silvio 
Berlusconi's demand for a clarification of the League's policy 
line. And with regard to [Interior Minister] Roberto Maroni's 
proposal to federate the three allies of the Freedom Alliance 
into a single party, the League leader said: "That must be some 
journalist's invention. The League will never be a fragment of 
Forza Italia. I realize that there are some people who are 
accustomed to saying, `we are all men on horseback,' but we are 
not men on horseback; we are ordinary people who go on foot." 
  Yesterday was a tough day for Bossi. The decision, announced 
Tuesday [14 June], to make the League a workers' party by the 
end of 1995 prompted a great many responses both inside and 
outside the movement. Starting yesterday morning thousands of 
members telephoned their local officials to demand explanations 
and to protest the feared swing to the Left. Meanwhile, an 
unofficial poll in the lower house and the Senate showed that 
some 80 percent of members of the League's parliamentary groups 
agree with the present government and are in favor of the 
majority that supports it. These are two bad signs for the 
leader, who did not try to evade the issue of this minor 
earthquake, and spoke to journalists at length to explain his 
thoughts about a single party, the government, and the future of 
the League. And he altered his stance somewhat on some of the 
most controversial aspects. 
  The single party -- "So Berlusconi said that there should be 
a clarification within the League. Who cares? Let him 
concentrate on clarifying his own party. In any case, a prime 
minister should not interfere... Why does he not himself become 
absorbed into his `Forza-thing'? It is the facts that count, 
and the facts are that he wants to turn the Freedom Alliance -- 
which we invented -- into the single party. There can never be 
a single party, for ideological reasons, because of the values 
and traditions that divide us, and because of the issue of 
democracy." 
  The government -- "I spent three months in intellectual 
isolation before the Assago and Bologna congresses that chose 
the path of joining the government. Now there is no alternative 
to the Freedom Alliance, and it is bound to govern for at least 
a few years in order to ensure the country's stability, and to 
avert very serious confusion. An election in November would 
create confusion, and would entail a return to intellectual 
isolation. Instead, we must strengthen our option for 
differentiation within this alliance and within this government." 
  The League's role -- "Within this alliance and within this 
government we must represent the working class, on the basis of 
the values that are part of our tradition. We do not represent 
the papist and conservative component, and we can never do so. 
Forza Italia and the National Alliance, on the other hand, 
represent the conservative movement." 
  Flirtation with the Left -- "There is no flirtation with the 
Left, as has been said hitherto. If you like, there is a signal 
that we are issuing to the forces that are now on the other side 
and that are disintegrating, particularly following [Democratic 
Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto's resignation, to let them 
know that, if there is an acceptance of common liberal 
democratic and federalist values, there is a force within the 
alignment that is not conservative. In a few years' time we 
will see who the real working class is who and the elitist and 
superficial forces are. Meanwhile, Sunday I am going to 
Pontida, but I am certainly not going there to appear on 
television, as Berlusconi does."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Gianfranco Fini, secretary general </F>
of the National Alliance, by Yosi Bar in Rome on 15 June] 
  [Text] Ever since the Italian neofascist party joined the 
coalition -- which sparked sharp protests not only in Israel but 
also in Europe and the United States -- party leader Gianfranco 
Fini has been courted by numerous correspondents, including 
Israelis. Yesterday he granted YEDI'OT AHARONOT an interview. 
  Right at the beginning of the interview, Fini attempted to 
improve his party's image and to shake off the term 
"neofascist." "I am a rightist," he said. "I invented the term 
`postfascist' only to help the reporters out." 
  Before the elections, Fini scored a major success in 
improving his party's image by, among other things, giving it a 
new name, suggesting its dissociation from its fascist past. 
The trick worked, and the party (the National Alliance) scored 
a fine achievement in the elections, joined the coalition, and 
received five portfolios. 
  The Israeli Government was enraged and has decided to 
boycott 
the neofascist ministers in all forums until it is convinced 
that they do not support anti-Semitic and racist stands. 
Referring to this, Fini told YEDI'OT AHARONOT: ``I understand 
Israel. It is the only country in the world I understand very 
well, but my party members were elected democratically. 
  "I hope to pass the test put to us by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and the Israeli Government. It is only fair that 
Israel should scrutinize the rightist ministers of the Italian 
Government. It is your moral right. We will prove that we are 
not in the least anti-Semitic or racist." 
  The leader of the right wing, as he calls himself, condemned 
anti-Semitism, saying that Mussolini's racist laws were the 
cause of many "atrocities." According to him, he supported 
turning over Nazi criminal Erich Friebke who fled to Argentina, 
and, along with left-wing activists, he even signed a petition 
urging that Friebke be put on trial. He stressed that he has 
severed his ties with Le Pen, the leader of the French extreme 
right, and has reservations regarding the German Republikaner 
party, which he defines as a neo-Nazi party. 
  "I have many Jewish friends who voted for me," he said, 
adding jokingly: "How can I, with my crooked nose, be an 
anti-Semite"? 
  Fini believes that there is no fear of a new wave of 
anti-Semitism erupting in West Europe but cautions. 
"Anti-Semitic winds are blowing in from East Europe," he 
claimed. 
  Fini said that, as a child, he went with his parents to 
visit 
the Mauthausen concentration camp and witnessed the atrocities 
of the Nazi regime. He promises to use an iron fist to curb the 
extreme factions in his party. 
  "I can assure you," he said at the end of the interview, 
"that the fact that the right is part of the Italian Government 
will not impair its good relations with Israel. Previous 
Italian Governments supported you in word; we will support you 
in deed."

<F P=106> [Interview with Shmu'el Hadas, Israeli Ambassador to the </F>
Vatican, by Umberto de Giovannangeli; place and date not given: 
"Israeli Diplomat Says: `We Will Fight Together Against Racism 
and Anti-Semitism'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- "This is a message of hope which goes far 
beyond the political sphere: In fact, the beginning of full 
diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican represents a 
good antidote against the racist and anti-Semitic intolerance 
which is again emerging in Europe." Thus began our interview 
with Shmu'el Hadas, the new Israeli ambassador to the Vatican. 
  [Giovannangeli] What significance does the establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the Vatican have for Israel? 
  [Hadas] The conclusion of a long-drawn, difficult process 
which began with the birth of the state of Israel 46 years ago, 
as well as the beginning of a new relationship, based on 
solidarity and tolerance, between the Catholic and the Jewish 
worlds. 
  [Giovannangeli] Therefore, this agreement does not only have 
diplomatic significance. 
  [Hadas] Unquestionably. The agreement which has been reached 
can favor the development of a common initiative against the 
reemergence of racism and anti-Semitism. We have now launched a 
message of hope, underlying the very meaning of religious faith. 
Religions must unite people, not divide them. Israel and the 
Vatican did not merely decide to exchange diplomatic 
representations. If anything, this step is the logical outcome 
of a common process of rethinking many centuries of history 
which were often marked by divisions and hate. Today we have 
decided to put and end, together, to this sad chapter by going 
back to our origins, that is to say, rediscovering that common 
heritage of social solidarity and respect for diversity which 
lies at the heart of both the Jewish and the Catholic faith. 
The greatness of this diplomatic event lies, in the first 
place, in its ethical value. 
  [Giovannangeli] What is your opinion of the self-critical 
review currently undertaken by the German Catholic church on the 
responsibility incurred by Catholic theology in providing 
"religious pretexts" to those who persecuted the Jews? 
  [Hadas] The document in question represents an important act 
of courage which helps restore the historical, albeit bitter, 
truth. It has certainly promoted dialogue between Catholics and 
Jews, making possible further rapprochement. Admitting one's 
share of responsibility for such an enormous tragedy as the 
Holocaust is not only a gesture of respect for the millions of 
Jews who were exterminated by the Nazis. It is also a moral 
lesson offered to younger generations, who must be in the 
position to fully understand -- with no "gray areas" -- one of 
the most tragic periods in the history of mankind. 
  [Giovannangeli] In what ways can the understanding between 
Israel and the Vatican influence the development of the peace 
process in the Middle East? 
  [Hadas] The exchange of diplomatic representatives must be 
seen in the context of the new climate of dialogue which has 
come about in the Middle East with the peace agreements signed 
between Israel and the PLO. Thanks to his considerable moral 
authority, the pope has played and can still play a major role 
in permanently establishing peace in this troubled region of the 
world, where religions have always carried much weight, and not 
always in a positive sense. In the Middle East, hatred has been 
nurtured and wars have been fought "in God's name" for far too 
long. The "basic agreement" reached between Israel and the 
Vatican can help build a culture based on "listening to each 
other" among Israelis and Arabs, Jews and Muslims; a culture 
centered on man as an entity whose rights are "inviolable," 
independently of individuals' religious faith. 
  [Giovannangeli] However, Jerusalem is not included in the 
agreement. In your opinion, when will it finally become 
possible to tackle the question of the "holy city's" status? 
  [Hadas] Israel and the PLO have shown great political wisdom 
by deciding to postpone a rather difficult debate -- considering 
what Jerusalem means to everyone concerned -- until a second 
stage in the negotiations. A gradual approach has proven the 
best means of enabling a first agreement to be reached. This 
also applies to relations between Israel and the Vatican. As 
far as we are concerned, we will do everything in our power to 
ensure complete freedom of worship in a city which is sacred to 
Jews, Catholics, and Muslims alike. Jerusalem's historical, 
spiritual, and archaeological value belongs to everybody. As 
such, it must be safeguarded. Ensuring that the city's holy 
places can be "enjoyed" by everybody is a first, important step 
toward subsequently discussing the town's status.

    [Editorial Report] Two commentaries in the Portuguese press 
dealt with the issues of national sovereignty and whether to 
increase the authority of the European Union (EU). 
<H5>  "Antifederalists" Make EU Domestic Issue </H5>
  Writing in the 23 May Lisbon daily PUBLICO, Alvaro 
Vasconcelos, president of the Institute for Strategic and 
International Studies, credited "antifederalists" -- opponents 
of a more federated EU -- with bringing the EU issue to the 
center of the political debate in Portugal. This has ensured 
that the question will not be the sole purview of governments, 
Vasconcelos continued, and will contribute to the 
democratization of the European process and the increased 
ability of the Portuguese people to influence both governmental 
and EU decisions. To this end, however, the difficult questions 
linked to the goal of achieving a politically united Europe must 
be discussed and the debate must no longer be defined by the 
anti-Europeanists, Vasconcelos warned. Europeanists have 
avoided a debate on a federal EU because they believe that 
"Europe does not produce votes." It is difficult to understand 
this conviction, Vasconcelos wrote, given that polls show 
popular support for "deepening" the EU. The debate on the EU, he 
continued, is of "poor" quality because it has not focused on 
essential issues such as the EU's "democratic deficit" 
(shortcomings in providing democratic institutions) and the 
substantial powers to be granted to the European Parliament, the 
lack of transparency in making decisions, the participation of 
citizens, and the consequences of enlargement. In addition, 
Vasconcelos maintained, the economic debate should not be 
restricted to how to spend EU funds. It should include a 
discussion on the necessary measures to overcome the economic 
crisis and on the utility of the EU Commission's white book on 
unemployment. The security problems now confronting Europe, 
especially the resurgence of nationalism, should also be an 
important part of the debate. The question of lost sovereignty 
is endlessly debated at a time when "the danger is not `more 
Europe' but indeed `less Europe,'" Vasconcelos wrote. 
"Antifederalists" may well contribute to the reinforcement of an 
EU discussion on federalism by making Europe the center of 
Portugal's political debate, Vasconcelos concluded. 
<H5>  Sovereignty Issue Discussed </H5>
  To shed light on the European issue it is necessary to 
clarify the confusion surrounding the debate on national 
sovereignty, wrote Teresa de Sousa in the 23 May PUBLICO. While 
Portugal lost sovereignty when it joined the European Community, 
it also gained more power on the international scene and is now 
better able to defend its economic, diplomatic, and security 
interests, de Sousa maintained. The need to compete with Japan 
and the United States justified the transformation to a single 
European currency, De Sousa wrote. Given the globalization of 
the economy and the liberalization of the financial markets, 
countries as small as Portugal or as large as France will be 
unable to control the stability of their currencies. Thus 
monetary union between the various EU states, which demands a 
narrowing of the levels of economic development and a high 
degree of financial stability, would help the economic and 
social cohesion policy aimed at helping economically weaker 
countries such as Portugal. 
  Portugal does not lose autonomy with the Common Foreign and 
Security Policy (CFSP), de Sousa continued, because each country 
is free to pursue its own foreign policy correponding to its 
specific national interests. On the other hand, Lisbon's 
negotiating capabilities with third countries will increase 
significantly because of its EU membership. 
  With the abolition of the EU's internal borders, one of the 
arguments of EU foes has been that Portugal must receive East 
European immigrants while rejecting African or Brazilian 
immigrants, therefore limiting its autonomy in granting entry 
permits. In de Sousa's opinion, however, the restrictions 
applied to the entry of immigrants and refugees from former 
Portuguese colonies are fully Lisbon's area of competence.

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen and Henrik Qvortrup: "Center </F>
Democrats Make New Demands on Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] The Center Democratic Party (CD) flatly rejects a 
Social Democratic (SDP) or SDP-Radical Liberal (SR) government 
and if the CD participates in a government headed by the Social 
Democrats again it will step up its demands. CD group chairman 
Peter Duetoft has made that clear. 
  Like the Christian People's Party, the CD, which is a member 
of the government, now refuse to give Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen (SDP) a free ticket to continue as head of the 
government after the next Folketing election. 
  The CD have already decided two things: 

  -  The party will 
not support a Rasmussen government without participating itself: 
"We flatly reject both a minority Social Democratic government 
and an SR government because that would give us no control over 
the direction they take," said CD group chairman Duetoft, who 
will continue to make every effort to keep the Socialist 
People's Party (SF) from gaining influence. 
  -  And if the CD does 
participate in a Rasmussen government again the price will be 
higher than it was when the last government was formed. 

  Duetoft said that the CD ``will definitely make more 
demands. 
  ``And we want cooperation toward the right side of the 
Folketing and not the left,'' said Duetoft, pointing directly at 
the Conservative Party as a desirable partner for a Rasmussen 
government. 
  The new statements from the CD have further increased the 
pressure on Prime Minister Rasmussen. 
  The other small government party, the Christian People's 
Party, has long refused to guarantee continued loyalty. 
  Duetoft has announced that the CD will spend the summer 
deciding who the party will support after the coming Folketing 
election.

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller and Bent Winther: "Prime </F>
Minister's Local Forces Favor SF"] 
  [Text] If an opportunity for close cooperation among the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Socialist People's Party 
(SF), and the Radical Liberals arises it should be exploited, 
according to a number of prominent local Social Democrats. 
  Several local Social Democrats are tired of their government 
partners, the Center Democrats (CD) and the Christian People's 
Party (KrF,) and think the SDP should focus on cooperating with 
the SF. 
  This was shown by conversations BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has had 
with eight Social Democratic county chairmen. The statements 
were made after Radical Liberal Party leader Marianne Jelved 
said that she is having "increasingly close" talks with the 
Socialist People's Party. 
  Poul Oland, the SDP chairman for the capital district, said 
the Social Democrats now need to be "free agents" with a sharper 
profile. 
  "Personally I have absolutely nothing against the influence 
the SF could exert. I would not vote against a constellation 
with the SF and the Radicals," he says. 
  Elisa Pedersen, Funen County chairman and a member of the 
executive committee, said it would be "lovely" if the SF was 
included in a government. "The Socialist People's Party is 
closer to us than the KrF and the CD. If we fight for something 
it should not be for the CD. There is mounting dissatisfaction 
here and there about showing the small government parties so 
much consideration," she said. 
  North Jutland County chairman Bjarne Harder Larsen said the 
same thing: "Many people think that the small center parties are 
very difficult to drag around with us and that we are being 
pulled around by the nose. And I can well understand that. It 
would be better to do something with the Radicals and the SF." 
  At its Whitsun congress the SDP Youth League, DSU, will 
formulate a strong recommendation for cooperation with the SF. 
  "We should drop the CD at the first opportunity we get. Let 
us introduce a cooperation with the SF," said DSU chairman 
Henrik Larsen. "The CD and the Christians have constantly been 
extremely disloyal. It is painful to watch." 
  Ringkobing County chairman Bent Kruuse said the SF has many 
votes that "could be put to better use." And Copenhagen County 
chairman Grethe Blomberg "would have absolutely nothing against 
a government with the SF and the Radicals." 
  The Storstrom, Bornholm, and Roskilde County chairmen want 
to 
wait and see, while the chairmen in West and North Zealand 
recommended broader cooperation with the middle parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Solveig Rodsgaard: "The Long Election Period"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The politicians and the voters seldom see four 
years go by between elections. This is deplored by some, but 
majority support for fixed election periods is lacking. 
  The year 1994 will be a remarkable election year. It looks 
as 
if the four-year election period will be fully utilized except 
for a few months. Neither the voters nor the politicians could 
have foreseen this when the last Folketing election was held on 
12 December 1990, for Danes are not used to such a long time 
elapsing between Folketing elections. 
  However it gives the politicians ample opportunity to stress 
campaign positions and engage in political debate even though 
the date of the election is not yet known. In long interelection 
periods the last year is used almost exclusively for getting 
into position for the coming election. This can be clearly seen 
at the moment, and it is amplified by the fact that there is no 
major legislation up for discussion in the Folketing. 
  On the other hand it must be noted that during the long 
election period two notable popular referendums on European 
Union (EU) policy have been held, so the voters have been to the 
polls. 
  In the past 30 years the election period has been almost 
fully utilized only three times. The VKR 
[Liberal-Conservative-Radical Liberal] government came to power 
as a majority government after the Folketing election on 23 
January 1968. Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard called the next 
Folketing election on 21 September 1971. The government lost its 
majority and the Social Democrats took over. 
  The next time the election period was almost used up was 
under Poul Schluter's leadership. He called a Folketing election 
on 10 December 1984 when his four-party coalition government was 
voted down on the budget bill, and the next Folketing election 
was not called until 8 September 1987. The four government 
parties lost seats, but the coalition was reestablished. 
  When a Folketing election was held on 12 December 1990, the 
result was a KV [Conservative-Liberal] government under Poul 
Schluter. A little over two years later Schluter and the 
government resigned because of the Tamil affair, and Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen stepped into office. Now he is the one who must call 
the next Folketing government. Whether it is held in September, 
October, or November, the election period will have been almost 
entirely used up. 
<H5>  Short Election Periods </H5>
  Paragraph 32 of the Constitution states that Folketing 
members are elected for four years. But the paragraph also 
contains the provision concerning the prime minister's right to 
dissolve the Folketing: "The king can call a new election at any 
time with the effect that the existing Folketing mandates become 
invalid when the new election has been held." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Restricting Dissolution Right </H5>
  Lars Bille, associate professor of political science at 
Copenhagen University, says it would restrict the political 
system too much if fixed election periods that cannot be 
deviated from are introduced: 
  "I do not think that would be healthy. Situations can arise 
when it may be necessary to dissolve the parliament and call an 
election. But restricting the prime minister's opportunities to 
call an early election might well have a stabilizing effect on 
the political system." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Keep Dissolution Right </H5>
  Conservative Party leader Hans Engell does not think fixed 
election periods are something to work for: 
  "If fixed election periods are considered at all, it would 
require a major reform of our political system that includes a 
higher cutoff limit for parliamentary representation, among 
other things. They have fixed election periods in Norway and a 
higher cutoff limit, but that has not prevented Norway from 
getting into very difficult parliamentary situations in recent 
years when the political system has largely ground to a halt for 
long periods of time. They cannot call a Storting election, a 
minority government cannot get its policies approved, and at the 
same time the opposition cannot band together to overturn the 
government. In any case there is nothing to suggest that fixed 
election periods in Denmark, which has eight parties in the 
Folketing and where a minority government is almost always in 
power, would create greater parliamentary stability." 
  Engell says that the optimal situation for politicians, 
after 
all, is to try to make it through an entire election period: 
  "We have had some complete election periods too, you know, 
for example from 1984 to 1987 under Poul Schluter. We now have a 
complete period again, though we had a government change in the 
middle. This provides some stability, but it must be admitted 
that a government change without a Folketing election leaves a 
residue of political frustration among the voters, who would 
like a chance to express themselves before the government is 
formed. Our experiences from January 1993 until now have shown 
that it would have been a big advantage -- also for Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen, I think -- if there had been a real mandate to form a 
government." 
  Engell wants to keep the dissolution right: 
  "It provides a way to resolve a difficult parliamentary 
situation. The best thing is an unbroken election period in 
which the four years are utilized in a politically effective way 
by the government in combination with the Folketing. The next 
best thing -- if this cannot be achieved -- is that the prime 
minister has the authority to call an election." 
  The Conservative leader does not think the fact that no one 
knows when the election will come hinders the political debate 
in the last part of a long election period: 
  "The political debate is going full blast. It is one thing 
that the government cannot pursue its policy, but that does not 
hinder the debate from developing." 
<H5>  Radical Liberals </H5>
  Radical Liberal leader and Economic Affairs Minister 
Marianne 
Jelved says the Radical Folketing group will continue to work 
for the appointment of a constitutional commission and that the 
Radicals want fixed election periods, "in a moderated form." "We 
have discussed the German model where the prime minister has the 
right to dissolve the parliament, but with restrictions, and 
where it is also more difficult to overturn a minority 
government because they must assess whether there is a basis for 
forming an alternative government." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" article by Henrik Qvortrup: "A Defeat With </F>
Its Bright Sides"] 
  [Text] Poul Nyrup Rasmssuen probably was pretty 
disappointed yesterday. 
  Not even a Social Democrat of the superoptimistic variety 
can 
interpret the voters' searing blow in the European Union [EU] 
election as a victory for the prime minister, his party, or his 
government. 
  The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen was nevertheless not in full 
mourning is due first and foremost to the fact that the election 
result -- no matter how demoralizing it may be for the Social 
Democratic Party [SDP] -- nevertheless contains some encouraging 
elements for the prime minister. Or it does so at least if he 
performs the experiment of shifting the voters' judgment over to 
the Folketing election, which lies only a few months into the 
future. 
  Prior to this election the major unknown is: Will the 
Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress 
Party achieve an absolute majority? -- a question that the prime 
minister in particular can be expected to be much concerned with 
in the months ahead. 
  In the light of this it is probably not incorrect to assume 
that Nyrup Rasmussen and his advisers yesterday did some sums of 
their own. Like adding together the percentage support for the 
Liberal Party, the Conservative People's Party, and the Progress 
Party in the EU election. 
  The answer to this sum is 44.4 percent -- that is, a good 
way 
below 50 percent of votes. 
  So even if it is humiliating for the Social 
Democrats to be overtaken by their archrivals, the Liberals and 
Conservatives, in the European Parliament, there is hope for 
Nyrup Rasmussen. 
  In this context he can take pleasure in the fact that a 
large 
number of the lost Social Democratic votes went to parties and 
movements that either will not run in the Folketing elections or 
are to be considered "friends." 
  The Social Democrats have, therefore, every justification to 
expect that some of the Social Democrats who chose to vote for 
the June Movement or the People's Movement [Against the EC] will 
return "home" in the Folketing elections. 
  At the same time the EU election has acted as a sort of 
safety valve for Social Democrats frustrated by the EU: Now 
their dissatisfaction has been demonstrated and 
beginning with the Folketing elections it will again be domestic 
political issues that determine where they place their crosses. 
  Or this is what Nyrup Rasmussen hopes at least. 
  Nevertheless the election must give the prime minister one 
or 
two things to think about -- also from the domestic viewpoint. 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen must think not least about what is wrong 
with the Social Democratic election machine. 
  Before the EU election it was the general assumption that 
the 
Social Democrats' enormous machine would through an effective 
election campaign be able to win some of the doubters over into 
the fold. As we now know, the maneuver did not succeed very 
well. And this despite the fact that in the last weeks of the 
election campaign Nyrup Rasmussen invested all his authority as 
prime minister in it. Not even his confrontations on television 
with [Liberal Party leader] Uffe Ellemann-Jensen were much help. 
  This depressing fact must result in some wrinkling of the 
foreheads among the Social Democrats. For even if their list of 
candidates was not dominated by the great personalities, the 
inescapable question thrusts itself on party activists -- and 
partners in government: 
  If Nyrup could not give us a good election this time -- who 
says that he will be able to do so next time? And the fact that 
the Social Democratic Party's coffers are not exactly full on 
the eve of the Folketing elections must further contribute to 
the nervousness. 
  But the biggest worry for the Social Democrats is of course 
the gulf between the party's official European stance and its 
core voters' more than skeptical view of the EU. 
  And given the emphatic demonstration of the Social 
Democratic 
opposition to the EU Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will now be forced to 
adjust his policy in the European sphere. 
  Where the prime minister would have preferred much great 
freedom of action in the run-up to the decisive 
intergovernmental conference in 1996, his hands are in reality 
now firmly tied by the blow he received from the voters 
yesterday. To put it briefly: He has no option other than a 
particularly defensive European strategy. The voters' judgment 
on this point cannot be misunderstood. 
  Now the prime minister needs time to digest the signal. And 
then strategy must be adjusted accordingly. 
  In the light of this at least the Folketing election -- the 
date of which is still not known -- has not come any closer. 
And in addition, the prime minister has his own psychological 
reasons for wanting a very late election: 
  The odor of defeat that the EU election has inflicted on the 
Social Democrats must be gone before Poul Nyrup Rasmussen goes 
out to meet the voters in what will probably be the most open 
and decisive Folketing elections for many years.

<F P=106> [Report by Morten Fyhn: "EU Clarification in Good Time"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- All the outstanding problems between 
Norway and the European Union [EU] on the subject of 
agricultural subsidies will be solved before the end of 
September, the trade minister has said. 
  In good time before the EU referendum on 28 November, Norway 
and the EU Commission will have reached agreement on the content 
and size of all the support arrangements that will be given to 
Norwegian agriculture in the event of EU membership, Trade 
Minister Grete Knudsen promised in Brussels yesterday. In 
concrete terms this means that everything must be on the table 
before the end of September. 
  "Then we have both October and November to study everything 
so that people will know what the issues are," the minister said. 
  In the absence through sickness of the agriculture minister, 
who has had back surgery, Grete Knudsen yesterday met EU 
Commissioner Rene Steichen chiefly to discuss "the splendid 
map," as Knudsen put it. The map will show how large areas 
south of the 62d parallel will be covered by a new support 
system for so-called northern agriculture. All of Norway north 
of the 62d parallel is covered by subsidies to northern 
agriculture that faces difficulties. 
  "There is no great distance between us," the trade minister 
said after the meeting. She stressed that the Norwegian side is 
working on the basis of the existing subsidy zones in Norway, 
because they "are known quantities and something that people 
here at home are familiar with. The map must be seen as fair," 
she stressed. 
  According to the minister, there is not very much dividing 
Norway and the Commission if you measure in percent or in the 
size of areas. The problem is more to do with which areas. As 
an example of the Commission's thinking in the past at least, 
she mentioned two local councils -- Etne and Olen -- in her home 
province of Hordaland that have always been covered by the same 
support arrangements. Under the terms of the Commission's 
proposals suddenly only one of them would qualify for support, 
and that is something Norway will not have, she said. 
  The trade minister will have another meeting with the 
Commission in mid-July. At this meeting the Commission will 
respond to Norway's proposals.

  [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt regrets that 
[Minister of Environment and Resources] Olof Johansson has 
decided to resign. Carl Bildt answered the question at a news 
conference a little while ago as to whether Olof Johansson could 
be included in a new right-wing government. Bildt said: 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] You have to ask him that. The 
political prerequisites in general he should account for; but 
what he has already shown us is that they are not influenced. 
He is part of this government [laughs], has been part of this 
government, the Center Party is still part of this government, 
and all the political decisions, all the political principles, 
and the political engagements that the government stands for. 
But the question should by right be put to Olof and not me. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the Center Party could be 
part of a new right-wing government? 
  [Bildt] The Center Party is in a right-wing government, has 
been in a right-wing government, and is still in a right-wing 
government. This resignation is a very strong political 
statement from the Center Party in an individual matter. It is 
stronger than what I thought was necessary, but it is clear that 
it does not change anything in the sense that it was not a 
surprise. It was not something politically new today in the 
sense that the Center Party would have revealed a new political 
attitude. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister Bildt was firm that the 
bridge 
question did not need anymore preparations, as Olof Johansson 
has demanded. 
  [Bildt] If I had thought, or the other party leaders, that 
one or two, or maybe three, or whatever number of extra weeks 
had brought a solution to this question it is clear that we 
would have in that case used this extra time. We have used a 
very long time on this so we could have used a little bit more 
time, but no one who has heard Olof Johansson express himself in 
the fundamental bridge question can actually believe that this 
would have been the case. [end recording]

  [Text] A serious installation mistake has been discovered 
in the Forsmark nuclear power station during an overhaul, Radio 
Uppland reports. It is a so-called blast plate that has been 
installed incorrectly. The task of the blast plate is to 
explode if the pressure in the reactor becomes too high. 
Because the plate was incorrectly installed, it would not have 
been of any use if there had been an accident. According to Alf 
Lindfors, head of the Forsmark station, it is a serious matter 
that the fault was not discovered earlier.

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] The Cypriot Government submitted seven proposals to 
the United Nations on the future of the Cyprus issue. Foreign 
Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis is presenting this document during 
his U.S. meetings. According to reports, the foreign minister 
notes that this policy will create the appropriate climate for a 
solution, not the confidence-building measures as the United 
States is suggesting. 
  On the other hand, an effort by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktas to appear as if he is accepting the confidence-building 
measures fell apart following a statement-denial by Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus. UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali and the Security Council will decide whether 
Denktas' clarifications are satisfactory. Reports say that the 
occupation leader listed a series of conditions on the document 
that cancel out its acceptance. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed that a 
document has been sent to the UN Secretariat but avoided 
revealing its contents. Turkish Cypriot newspaper KIBRIS 
yesterday referred extensively to the document, and diplomatic 
sources confirmed to I SIMERINI its validity. The document 
reiterates Nicosia's decision not to resume talks on the 
confidence-building measures and Nicosia's warning that it will 
withdraw its support for the 21 March UN document and promote 
its own reservations. The seven proposals are as 
follows: 

  -  First: The demilitarization of the 
island. 
  -  Second: The issue of guarantees in a future 
solution. 
  -  Third: A UN Security Council reconfirmation that it 
will not accept any decision but one based on one sovereignty, 
nationality, and international image. 
  -  Fourth: An issue of 
demographic changes and a population census. 
  -  Fifth: The Turkish 
troops issue. 
  -  Sixth: An appeal for Turkey to return Famagusta 
according to UN Security Council resolution 550. 
  -  Seventh: An 
appeal by the five UN Security Council permanent representatives 
for European Union representation in the talks. 

  In any case, questions have been raised about yesterday's 
meeting between UN officials and Denktas. In his statement, 
Denktas appeared to have accepted everything. He said: "We 
have accepted the UN demands and they promised to incorporate 
what was agreed in Vienna into the document." Clarifying on 
which positions he had changed, Denktas referred to the issue of 
access to Famagusta's fenced-off area, which remained one of the 
basic obstacles. Denktas said he agreed to move the Turkish 
troops 1 kilometer according to UN wishes, but noted by doing 
this (the Attila) will approach the National Guard positions by 
200 meters. At the same time he agreed to move the "police" 
station from the eastern part of Dherynia Road and that the 
international organization will cover the cost. 
  New York will evaluate Denktas' clarifications (which 
Butrus-Ghali demanded) and decide whether these positions 
constitute an agreement for the talks to continue. In any case 
Feissel described Denktas' clarifications as positive, but as 
soon as his statements became known he was quick to say that it 
is Denktas' personal view that he has accepted the document. He 
even clarified that he made no promises. 
  Feissel had a telephone conversation with the president and 
briefed him on the meeting. According to our information, 
Kliridhis did not want to be informed about Denktas' positions; 
he only wanted to know whether or not he had accepted the 21 
March UN document. Yesterday the government spokesman said that 
Denktas' remarks do not constitute an acceptance of the document 
and added that our side was not told that Denktas' positions 
constitute satisfactory answers. 
  Yesterday, Feissel sent the UN secretary general a report on 
his meeting with Denktas.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis said that a 
picture has begun taking shape as to what the next steps by the 
United Nations on the Cyprus issue should be. In a statement 
after his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali this 
evening, Mr. Mikhailidhis added that the picture will be 
formulated as soon as Gustave Feissels' report on his latest 
meeting with Rauf Denktas arrives at the UN Headquarters. Asked 
to comment on reports that Denktas has accepted the 
confidence-building measures, the foreign minister said that the 
important thing is what Gustave Feissel will say to the 
secretary general and not what Denktas says. He added: The UN 
Secretariat is ready, as soon as it receives the Feissel report, 
to finalize the plan of action and suggestions with which it 
will apply to the Security Council. 
  The foreign minister further noted that he has the 
impression 
that the suggestions he made to the secretary general will be 
jointly assessed in formulating the positions of the UN 
Secretariat. 
  A press spokesman for the UN secretary general said that at 
the meeting they discussed all the aspects of the secretary 
general's good offices mission including the confidence-building 
measures and other questions of substance. The spokesman said 
that the United Nations continues to feel that the set of 
measures proposed is balanced with advantages for both sides. 
He was not in a position to comment on the latest Denktas 
statement and made it clear that he is waiting for Feissel's 
report. 
  In an interview with Voice of America, the foreign minister 
described the results of his contacts in Washington and New York 
as very satisfactory. He added: The suggestions by the Cypriot 
side for getting out of the current situation concern the need 
for a new approach to the Cyprus issue for the Security 
Council's involvement which would mean upgrading the dialogue 
and strengthening the whole effort as well as creating a new 
agenda. The foreign minister concluded: The Cypriot side's 
suggestions were listened to with care and interest and will be 
evaluated properly.

  [Text] Rauf Denktas, in a new maneuver, appears in a 
statement to have accepted all the points raised by the United 
Nations on the confidence-building measures. Speaking to 
correspondents after his meeting with Gustave Feissel today, 
Denktas said that Mr. Feissel must be satisfied now because he 
said that he gave Feissel all that he wanted. He further 
maintained that Feissel also gave the Turkish Cypriot side what 
it wanted. Denktas said that some changes will be made to the 
latest UN document of 21 March. He also noted that what is left 
now is to prepare the draft agreement for signing. 
  Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that Rauf Denktas has 
moved from some of his positions, but it has not become clear 
whether he accepts the 21 March UN document as is. Despite 
repeated questions from journalists, Mr. Feissel avoided saying 
whether the document had been accepted. He said: It is up to 
the UN secretary general and the Security Council to decide 
whether the clarifications given by Denktas today represent a 
development in the right direction. 
  Feissel confirmed that Denktas did not give anything in 
writing and added that today's meeting with him was the last. 
  The UN secretary general's representative has briefed 
President Glavkos Kliridhis on Denktas' clarifications. 
  In a statement made to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation] 
a short time ago, Gustave Feissel noted that what Rauf Denktas 
said about him having accepted all the points on the 
confidence-building measures is only the opinion of the Turkish 
Cypriot leader. Asked if Mr. Feissel really gave all that 
Denktas was demanding, as the Turkish Cypriot leader had said, 
according to REUTER, the UN official replied that this was 
inaccurate. Mr. Feissel made it clear that his mission was not 
to agree on anything. He added: My mission was to receive some 
clarifications, which I did and I will convey them to New York.

  [Text] Responding to a question on the latest statement by 
Rauf Denktas, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis noted 
that what Denktas says does not constitute acceptance of the 21 
March document. The spokesman stressed: Our position remains 
that we do not negotiate any further nor do we accept changes to 
the 21 March document. The spokesman added that the United 
Nations has not conveyed to our side that the new positions 
adopted by Denktas constitute a satisfactory answer. 
  The government spokesman also said that President Glavkos 
Kliridhis is committed to the unanimous decisions of the 
National Council and will resort to a people's verdict 
[referendum] on the confidence-building measures talks in the 
event there is a question of disagreement with the National 
Council. Mr. Kasoulidhis said: President Kliridhis will turn 
to the people in the event he is forced to continue the talks on 
the confidence-building measures despite the unanimous position 
of the National Council.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today 
stressed explicitly that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas did 
not accept the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building 
measures. Kasoulidhis said Denktas' claims, that he has given a 
positive answer on all points raised by the United Nations, are 
strictly his own personal evaluation. He said: Things will 
clear up after the UN Security Council's additional briefing by 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The spokesman added that if any change to the 21 March UN 
document would benefit either side, it would make the compromise 
unfair and unbalanced. He said: The March proposals constitute 
a compromise that the United Nations has described as fair and 
balanced. 
  The spokesman was replying to a statement by U.S. State 
Department Spokesman Michael McCurry, that the current pursuit 
is to combine the Greek Cypriot views, which have accepted the 
March proposals, and the Turkish Cypriot views, which have 
accepted a variation. Kasoulidhis noted that the March 
proposals do not conform to the positions of the Greek Cypriot 
side so there is no issue of merging with those issues that the 
Turkish Cypriot side have accepted in June.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kliridhis Not Bluffing"] </F>
  [Text] There is no reason to believe President Glavkos 
Kliridhis is bluffing in threatening to resign if the UN 
Security Council calls for talks to continue on the 
confidence-building measures. Many things have happened in the 
last few weeks to make Kliridhis' position difficult, even 
through we are not accustomed to politicians, and especially 
presidents, resigning over such, an admittedly, delicate matter. 
Then again, his resignation threat was probably the most 
effective way of emphasizing his objections to the continuation 
of discussions on the confidence-building measures, which he 
considers dead and buried. 
  Therein lies the president's miscalculation, for which he is 
prepared to give up his job. After the UN Secretary-General's 
report, which unequivocally blamed [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf 
Denktas for the failure to reach an agreement, Kliridhis assumed 
that the confidence-building measure chapter would be consigned 
to the dustbin of history, where so many other UN initiatives 
have ended up. Yet there had been warnings to the contrary. 
First, there was the Vienna meeting, at which U.S. and UN 
representatives met Denktas and a Turkish Foreign Ministry 
official in a last-ditch attempt to salvage the initiative. 
Second, in his report to the Security Council, the 
Secretary-General included the continuation of 
confidence-building measure discussions as one of five options, 
despite the earlier failure. 
  It became obvious that neither the United Nations nor the 
United States and Britain were prepared to abandon a whole 
year's work on the confidence-building measures, especially as 
they believed the few differences that prevented progress were 
not insurmountable. In the circumstances, it was unrealistic to 
expect the UN to abandon the measures and accept that a year's 
work had gone to waste, irrespective of Butrus- Ghali's report. 
And once Denktas had supposedly agreed to the main 
sticking-point, access to Varosha, there was no way the UN, the 
U.S. and Britain would abandon the process. To add insult to 
injury, the European Union observer's report on Cyprus, released 
earlier this week, also supported the continuation of 
discussions. In other words, all those countries and 
organisations that Kliridhis was relying on to condemn Denktas 
intransigence are, in no uncertain terms, backing the 
confidence-building measure process. 
  For an experienced politician like the president to declare 
the confidence-building measure talks dead, was more a case of 
wishful thinking then mistaken evaluation. Matters were made 
worse last week when the National Council unanimously agreed 
that the Greek Cypriot side would not agree to discuss the 
confidence-building measures again; and unanimous decisions are 
binding. Kliridhis had on the one hand committed himself to the 
UN on the confidence-building measures, and last week committed 
himself to not discussing them again. This explains his threat 
to resign. Admittedly, he made a serious miscalculation 
regarding the UN's and the United States' ability to bring 
Denktas round to their way of thinking. He did after all say 
before discussions had even begun that he did not expect the 
Turkish Cypriot side to accept the measures. 
  Then again, Kliridhis has good reason to feel aggrieved at 
the way things have gone. Unlike Denktas, he had cooperated 
constructively with the UN. Yet now the UN is helping the 
obstructionist get off the hook. It would seem that taking a 
hard line and being a difficult customer pay off in the end. 
Even so, the UN has no real grounds to believe Denktas will 
keep his word and go all the way on the confidence-building 
measures even if it has received assurances on the Varosha issue 
and discussion resume. Who can guarantee Denktas won't throw a 
spanner in the works once again? The preparedness of the UN, 
the United States and Britain to credit Denktas with good 
intentions defies logic and experience. 
  Kliridhis obviously feels his position has become untenable. 
But the UN and the countries involved cannot afford to let him 
carry out his threat, because that would be the end of the 
confidence-building measures. A new president, if things come 
to that pass, would not have any obligation to accept the 
confidence-building measures, in which case a year's efforts 
would go to waste. Perhaps the Secretary-General's other option 
of allowing a period of reflection for all concerned is in the 
circumstances the best suggestion for now.

the meeting lasted for one hour and, as always, it was held in a 
friendly atmosphere. 
  Mr. Papandreou briefed the president on the EU summit to be 
held in Corfu and the topics to be discussed. He also briefed 
Mr. Karamanlis on his intention to proceed with a government 
reshuffle which he scheduled for after the Corfu summit. 
  The prime minister also spoke to correspondents about the 
U.S. State Department's statement, according to which Greece is 
not entitled to a 10-mile national airspace but only six miles, 
the limit of its territorial waters. Responding to a question 
from a correspondent, the prime minister said that this has 
always been the U.S. position. Mr. Papandreou added: However, 
it has been historically established that we have a 10-mile 
airspace and not six miles, the limit of our territorial waters. 
This is something that is not going to change. [end recording]

  [Text] The Greek Government hopes the Turkish side will 
show goodwill so that tension in bilateral relations will be 
relieved. Commenting on a statement made yesterday by his 
Turkish counterpart, Ferhat Ataman, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Konstandinos Bikas said that Greece cannot consider it a 
goodwill move that Turkey is violating Greek national airspace 
with aircraft that do not carry missiles. Bikas stressed that 
the Greek Air Force must do its duty to defend the country's 
sovereignty by carrying the arms that it considers necessary. 
  Greek Ambassador in Washington Loukas Tsilas plans to lodge 
a 
demarche about U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry's 
statement yesterday questioning the extent of Greek national 
airspace. The airspace was set at 10 miles in 1931 according to 
a presidential decree and until 1974 was respected even by the 
Turkish side. Bikas explained that since 1931 Greece has 
extended its territorial waters to 10 nautical miles to define 
its airspace. He said: Our side, however, maintains its 
territorial waters at six nautical miles, although it is its 
sovereign right to extend them to 12 if and when it considers it 
necessary. 
  A short time ago, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos 
said that the U.S. State Department spokesman's statement was 
misinterpreted or was an off-hand handling of the issue. 
Venizelos reiterated that the Greek position on this issue are 
well known: they are non-negotiable sovereign rights. 
  Referring to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's statement 
about a possible Greek expansion of territorial waters to 12 
miles, the spokesman stressed that, although the Turkish 
president's remarks were calm compared to past ones, they do not 
stop recycling the well-known problem of artificial tension 
between the two countries.

  [Excerpts] Consistency in a politician certainly makes 
people feel sorry for him. The consistency of Konstandinos 
Stefanopoulos, who decided to dissolve the Democratic Renewal 
[DIANA] party--a decision that was implemented yesterday and was 
accompanied by his statement that he was leaving active politics 
as he had pledged to do before the [European Parliament, EP] 
election--certainly made many people, even more than those who 
voted for him, feel sorry. 
  DIANA yesterday ended its political life after nine years on 
the country's political scene. The party's Political Council 
and Executive Committee, who met yesterday under Stefanopoulos' 
chairmanship, decided by a majority vote to put an end to an 
effort which, if nothing more, was an example of consistency. 
  The Political Council and Executive Committee reviewed the 
EP 
election results as an extreme honor "and it constitutes a 
reward for DIANA's policy, which was consistent and in agreement 
with the general interest." [passage omitted] 
  A statement notes that the party's leading members "consider 
that continuing the party's efforts would be outweighed by the 
difficulties, of which the biggest are the lack of media 
coverage to promote the party's political platform and the lack 
of financial resources." [passage omitted]

Democracy Party [DEP] in the wake of speeches its leader Yasar 
Kaya made in Bonn, Germany, and Irbil, Iraq, and following his 
communique, entitled Peace Call, which was issued by party

DEP in accordance with Paragraph B of Article 101. 
  2. According to the final paragraph in Article 84 of the 
Constitution, the deputies listed below, who were party 
members on 2 December 1993, the date on which the suit to close

notification of the closure decision: Ahmet Turk, Ali Yigit, 
Sirri Sakik, Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Sedat Yurtdas, Selim 
Sadak, Orhan Dogan, Zubeyir Aydar, Naif Gunes, Mahmut Kilinc, 
Remzi Kartal, and Nizamettin Toguc. The deputyships of the 
deputies listed below have also been terminated because of their 
membership in the party at the time the suit to close the DEP 
was filed: Hazin Kilinc, Mahmut Alinak, Muzaffer Demir, Mahmut 
Uyanik, and Mehmet Emin Sever. 
  3. According to Article 107 of Law No. 2820, it was decided 
that all party assets will be transferred to the Treasury. 
  4. In order to implement the necessary steps in terms of the 
parliamentary status of the deputies, it was decided to send a 
copy of the decision to the TGNA. With regard to taking legal 
action, it was unilaterally decided on 16 June 1994 to send a 
copy of the decision to the Prime Minister's Office, the Supreme 
Court of Appeals, and the Office of the Chief Public Prosecutor 
in accordance with Article 107 of Law No. 2820. [end recording]

  [Text] On board Turkish frigate Fatih, June 16 (A.A.) -- 
President Suleyman Demirel said that the Turkish Armed Forces 
was ready to fulfill any duty assigned to itself. 
  On board the frigate Fatih during the Sea Wolf-94 exercise, 
Demirel said that a forcible solution on Cyprus would lead to 
turbulences on the island and would also reopen deep wounds 
between Turkey and Greece. 
  After the conclusion of the exercise, Demirel told a press 
conference that the Turkish nation felt great security because 
of its strong army. 
  `Our Armed Forces will fulfill any duty given to it by the 
people and the state,' Demirel said. `Both exercises were 
carried out excellently. Everyone can easily notice the great 
discipline and high-level of training the Army members have.' 
  Answering a question about Cyprus, Demirel said that peace 
was established on the island ever since the 1974 Peace 
Operation in Turkey. 
  `However,' he added, `a solution has been sought since then. 
A conclusion was not reached yet on a bi-zonal, bi-communal 
federated state based on political equality.' 
  `In fact,' he added, `the actual situation on the island is 
a 
solution. It has ended the bloodshed and the fighting between 
the two communities.' 
  He also stressed that the Greek Cypriot Administration in 
the 
south was recognized by the world as the Republic of Cyprus 
while the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC] was 
recognized only by Turkey. 
  `The 150,000 Turks in Cyprus are being treated by the world 
as if they were in a hostage camp in the eastern part of the 
Mediterranean,' he said. 
  Demirel went on to say that the world was still hostile 
against the Turkish presence in northern Cyprus. 
  `The per capita income in south Cyprus is 10,000 U.S. 
dollars 
while this figure is 3,000 dollars in the TRNC,' he said. 
  `It is necessary to seek a viable solution in Cyprus, rather 
than trying to impose a non-operative one,' he said.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, June 16 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin said on Thursday [16 June] that the regulations on the 
straits were under the authorization of Turkey and it will be 
put into effect on July 1 adding that giving up Turkey's 
sovereign rights was out of question. 
  Main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) Deputy Bulent 
Akarcali, speaking in the parliament, claimed that decisions 
against Turkey's sovereign rights were made during a meeting of 
International Maritime Organization where Turkish delegation 
also attended in London last month. 
  Akarcali said all Turkish sovereign rights on the Bosporus 
and Dardanelles were transferred to international organizations. 
  He said Turkish delegation had no proposals while Greek 
proposals were approved of with the support of Russian, Greek 
and Greek- Cypriot representatives. 
  Answering the ANAP deputy's claims, Cetin said the stories 
taking place in the press were not based on facts. 
  Cetin said the straits regulations were not discussed during 
the so-called meeting adding that traffic schemes were brought 
to that meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, June 16 (A.A.) -- Finance Minister Ismet 
Atilla said on Thursday [16 June] that there was 6.3 trillion 
lira extra revenue in consolidated budget in May as a result of 
the economic stability measures. 
  Atilla speaking to the ANATOLIAN Agency said the budget 
deficit was 4.4 trillion lira in January, 14.8 trillion lira in 
February and 32.1 trillion lira in May. 
  `However,' he added, `the budget deficit was drawn back to 
4.3 trillion lira.' 
  He declared the five-month budget expenses as 266.3 trillion 
lira and the budget incomes as 217.1 trillion lira. 
  `The budget incomes increased 91.3 percent when compared to 
last year,' he said. `The increase in budget deficit is 4.5 
percent.' 
  Atilla called the improvements after the practicing of the 
economic stability measures as `satisfactory.' 
  The measures, launched by the government on April 5 with the 
hope that it will bring stability to the economy, includes hikes 
on the price of oil, and taxes and a variety of sacrifices on 
the part of the people, as the only way to bring Turkey out of 
its deepening economic crisis.

<F P=106> [By Yalcin Dogan from the "Daily" column: "In the Grip of </F>
Poised Hammer"] 
  [Text] Poised Hammer officials could not care less. 
Poised Hammer officials and the Americans say: "In that case 
we would move to south Cyprus." Turkey, on the other hand, is 
being presumptuous regarding the Poised Hammer mandate. 
  Using Poised Hammer as a "trump card" was conceived when the 
United States was determined to decrease its aid to Turkey. The 
United States decided to cut the aid on the grounds that "Turkey 
is violating human rights." In reaction to this reasoning, 
Ankara declared that, in turn, it will not extend the Poised 
Hammer mandate, and went a step further noting, "if we want, we 
will reject all aid that is linked to conditions." 
  Ankara did not stop to argue whether or not human rights are 
actually being violated in Turkey. Nor does it turn inward and 
investigate "if human rights are really being violated." Maybe 
Ankara finds this an exercise in futility, because it knows that 
human rights are being violated in Turkey. Struggling against 
terrorism is one matter, and human rights violations are 
another. The easiest way out is to have a knee-jerk reaction, 
because these two issues are intermingled and because the 
administration's head is not clear on the matter. 
  What is tragic and comical at the same time is the fact that 
even this reaction is merely a show. Stating "I will not accept 
aid that is linked to conditions" is a cheap move. Can Tansu 
Ciller easily turn her back on the United States? The United 
States could not be deceived by this bluff on the part of 
Ciller, who owes her power to Clinton. It is as clear as day 
that this was meant for internal consumption. 
  Last week, on the day that Poised Hammer was raised as a 
trump card, the Americans conveyed their position to Ankara: 
  "In that case, we would move to south Cyprus. Much as 
Incirlik is a suitable place for supervising north Iraq, we can 
do the same from south Cyprus." Later, Washington added the 
following: 
  "We must cross Syria to fly from south Cyprus to north Iraq. 
We can obtain the necessary flight permit from Damascus. This 
can be done by us or by Talabani." 
  Poised Hammer has favorable relations with Talabani, who in 
turn has favorable relations with Damascus. Moreover, there is 
an ongoing dialogue between the United States and Damascus. In 
other words, if Turkey fails to extend the Poised Hammer 
mandate, it will not undermine the United States in any way. 
Therefore, as on many occasions in the past year, Ankara is 
once again making useless noise. 
  What is more, the U.S. Administration also said: 
  "When Turkey found itself in an economic crisis, Ciller 
asked 
President Clinton for help. Through the secretary of the 
treasury, Clinton called on IMF President Camdessus to support 
Turkey." 
  Nothing else need be said. This is what the United States 
wanted to say: "You cannot do much to us with Poised Hammer, 
but even if we do nothing, at the very least we can put a stop 
to IMF support." As things stand, therefore, Turkey, especially 
Ciller, do not have such power. 
  It is not so easy to govern a country merely by making noise 
for internal consumption. Last week's gesture is already 
wearing thin. Ankara is submissively deciding to extend the 
mandate of Poised Hammer. It is even determined to exert 
extensive efforts to this end. 
  This time, however, the problem lies with the Turkish Grand 
National Assembly. Although the National Security Council and 
the government decided in favor of the extension, it is 
difficult to gauge how effective this recommendation will be in 
the assembly. Not only the opposition, but members of the two 
coalition partners also believe that significant obstacles will 
emerge during the voting. 
  Even the last vote on the extension of the Poised Hammer 
mandate was a laborious one. Six months ago, the motion was 
adopted 194 votes to 160, while 87 deputies abstained. 
  Now, the Motherland Party is leaning toward negative votes 
and there are at least 25 Social Democratic Populist Party 
members who share the same tendency. This time, there are even 
those within the True Path Party who are opposed to Poised 
Hammer. Therefore, this will be an extremely critical vote for 
the government. 
  There is much agitation in Ankara now, and last week's 
bluffing has long been forgotten. Ciller is now exerting every 
possible effort to secure the extension of the mandate. If you 
do not know how to govern a country, this is the way you get 
your nose rubbed in it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Days With NATO..." -- punctuation as published] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ministers, diplomats, and military officials, 
who are able to decide on peace or war, met in Istanbul 
yesterday. The foreign ministers of 16 NATO countries met in 
Ciragan Palace and held bilateral talks. Meanwhile, the 
ministers of 20 countries that signed the "NATO Program on 
Partnership for Peace" were transported from Ataturk Airport to 
the Ciragan Palace. 
  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin was rather tense when he met 
his Greek counterpart, Karolos Papoulias. The Turkish and Greek 
foreign ministers agreed in principle the last time they met 
that "the sides should refrain from making provocative 
statements to the press and try to create a favorable atmosphere 
to inspire confidence." 
  The continuing clamor in the Greek press and the aggressive 
statements made by the Greek politicians placed the Greek 
foreign minister in a difficult position until recently. 
However, it was Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's turn to find 
himself in a difficult position this time. One of the Turkish 
newspapers quoted Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on its first page 
a few days ago as saying: "I will order troops to land on the 
Aegean islands within 24 hours of an initiative by Greece to 
extend its territorial waters in the Aegean Sea to 12 miles." 
  That was not a new development. Ankara's stand on that 
matter was established many years before Tansu Ciller was 
elected to serve as Turkey's prime minister. Greece was well 
aware of Turkey's approach. However, had Ciller made another 
mistake without any reason, particularly when preparations were 
being made for the NATO summit in Istanbul and the meeting of 
the Turkish and Greek foreign ministers? No, Ciller made that 
statement some time ago on the condition that it should not be 
published. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, the Greek foreign minister was informed of 
Ciller's warning. Consequently, that state of affairs had a 
bearing on his talks with his Turkish counterpart. 
  Greece has 3,049 large and small islands in the Aegean Sea. 
The military status of those islands has been established by 
international agreements. The most important among them is the 
Lausanne Agreement and that which was signed after World War II 
for the "demilitarization of the Dodecanese Islands." A move by 
Greece to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles will convert 
the Aegean Sea into a "Greek lake." Turkey disclosed in 1974 
that any attempt by Greece to extend its territorial waters 
would be regarded as a cause for war. Nevertheless, considering 
the Caracas Accord on the International Marine Law in 1982, the 
Greek officials have continued to reiterate their wish to extend 
their territorial waters. Greece, which has discovered oil 
close to Thasos in the northern part of the Aegean Sea, brings 
up the matter every summer and creates tension by arguing that 
it has the right to extend its territorial waters. In fact, 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias informed Turkish and Greek 
correspondents yesterday that he had nothing to add to what 
Greece has said on the matter in the past. 
  However, a move by the Turkish newspapers and Turkish 
Government officials to act in a more responsible way would be 
very useful. Several high-ranking officials make statements to 
the correspondents on matters about which they have little or no 
information at all. That state of affairs has created unexpected 
problems in Turkey's foreign policy. Their statements are taken 
seriously by Russia, Greece, and other countries from time to 
time. However, our newspapers are only concerned with the 
number of papers they sell. So, they exaggerate developments and 
disclose statements that should not be made public. 
  The following proverb is in order at this point: "The 
suffering of the nightingale is due to its tongue."

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley and Christopher Lockwood: "The </F>
Plot Thickens in EC Presidential Race"] 
  [Text] Britain could comfortably accept the appointment of 
M Jean-Luc Dehaene as EC president, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign 
Secretary, said yesterday. 
  Adopting a tone which will disappoint Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr 
Hurd defended the Belgian Prime Minister from attacks in the 
British press, saying he had "presided well" during Belgium's EC 
leadership last year. 
  M Dehaene has been depicted as an arch-federalist. Mr Hurd 
said that while he was not Britain's preferred choice, he could 
be acceptable. 
  Giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Mr 
Hurd said the Government was backing the candidacy of Sir Leon 
Brittan, former Home Secretary who is now the EC's external 
trade commissioner. 
  Until recently, Sir Leon was thought to be out of the 
running 
as other countries resisted the idea of a free-market British 
candidate. However, in recent days, he has received the backing 
of Italy's new Right-wing government and perhaps of Greece as 
well. 
  The decision may be made in Corfu on June 24. That evening, 
the EC's heads of government will dine there to discuss the 
candidates. 
  But diplomats believe there is also a growing risk that it 
will fail, occasioning the need for a second dinner in 
September, probably in Germany. 
  A few weeks ago, M Dehaene was starting to look like a 
certainty. He had the firm support of Paris, which liked him 
because he is a French speaker, committed to further European 
integration and, on past record, inclined to suspicion of 
unfettered free trade. 
  France managed to persuade the Germans to look favourably on 
him. One advantage M Dehaene had was that he was not Mr Ruud 
Lubbers, the Dutch Prime Minister. Mr Lubbers had upset 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by granting Britain opt-outs on currency 
union and the Social Chapter at Maastricht, by being hesitant 
over German reunification and by championing Amsterdam as home 
for the future European Central Bank. 
  Mr Lubbers's party lost elections last month and though he 
is 
likely to stay on as a caretaker, he is now available for the EC 
job. 
  Earlier this month, President Francois Mitterrand and Herr 
Kohl came near to annointing M Dehaene. That was a disaster. 
To choose him now is to admit that the 12 are run by France and 
Germany. 
  Suddenly, M Dehaene, who British sources were recently 
describing as "unstoppable," is looking distinctly stoppable. 
The Italians, Spanish, Greeks and British all incline towards 
other candidates. 
  If one or two of these can only pluck up the courage to say 
so to the Franco-German axis M Dehaene's candidacy would be dead.

<F P=106> [Article by Loic Bouvard, president of the North Atlantic </F>
Assembly and deputy speaker of the French National Assembly: 
"Russia in Turmoil"] 
  [Text] There are now fears that Russia might not sign the 
Partnership for Peace, the association proposed by NATO to all 
the countries of the former Warsaw Pact which seeks to take into 
account both the Central European countries' desire to join the 
Atlantic Alliance and Russia's reservations about seeing NATO 
expand and move eastward. 
  Why have we reached this deadlock situation when, at the 
last 
Clinton-Yelstin summit in Moscow, everything seemed to be going 
smoothly and in the right direction? 
  In my view, we should see in this much more the effect of 
Russia's domestic policy than any misunderstanding about the 
case of the ultimatum and the air strike in Bosnia. 
  Everything changed in Russia after the first free 
parliamentary elections on 12 December last year, which were 
clearly fair and which saw the victory of the extremists (right 
and left) over the center. 
  Indeed, the new Duma (Russia's national assembly) contains a 
slight majority of right-wing extremists (Zhirinovskiy and other 
nationalists) and left-wing extremists (Communist Party, "Women 
of Russia," and agrarians). 
  It is they who immediately decreed the release of Rutskoy 
and 
Khasbulatov, the defeated parties in last October's 
confrontation between President Yeltsin and the Assembly, which 
saw the White House, seat of the assembly, shelled and stormed. 
  It is they who oppose President Yeltsin's policy of 
rapprochement between Russia and the United States, between 
Russia and NATO. 
  These political forces, nationalists of all kinds, harking 
back to Greater Russia and the empire to be rebuilt, form a 
constant threat for the president, which he is forced to take 
into account. Hence his vacillations and about-faces, and those 
of his Foreign Minister Kozyrev. 
  Anything is a pretext for glorifying Russia, placing the 
emphasis on the humiliation it has suffered at the West's hands. 
For these people, NATO is the 45-year old enemy, which 
triumphed over the Warsaw Pact and with which no compromise is 
possible! The situation of the Russian minorities in the Baltic 
countries, NATO's alleged exclusion of Russia during the bombing 
raids around Gorazde, the Ukrainian claims to Crimea, anything 
is a pretext for attacking the government, calling for Mr. 
Kozyrev's resignation, and planning the 1996 presidential 
campaign against Yeltsin. 
  This is the situation. We are perhaps on the eve of the 
reawakening of imperialist Russia, taking up, through the CIS, 
the USSR's hegemony over its neighbors. 
<H5>  Nationalist Issue </H5>
  Belarus, which has never formed a state in the past, is 
already returning to the Russian fold. Ukraine, a country 
bigger than France inhabited by 50 million people, is 
floundering in economic depression and is close to 
disintegration, with the west (the former Westernized Galicia) 
opposing the east (Kharkov region, inhabited by Russians), and 
not to mention Crimea given to Ukraine by Khrushchev, himself a 
Ukrainian, which is inhabited mainly by Russians and which 
Russia is claiming. 
  The division of the Black Sea Fleet is raising apparently 
insoluble problems and is accompanied by the Russians' desire to 
occupy Sevastopol as a naval base within a network of some 20 
military bases in the nearby CIS countries. 
  The disparity in power between Russia and its CIS neighbors 
is such that it is difficult to see how the first can fail to 
collect its stake quickly and peacefully, unless Ukraine alone 
is reluctant. 
  Russia has asked the United Nations to give it a 
peace-keeping mandate in the countries of the former USSR, thus 
behaving toward the former Soviet republics, and especially 
Central Asia, in the same way as the mandate which could be 
given to NATO in Central Europe. 
<H5>  Partnership for Peace </H5>
  Russia, this very big country which remains a superpower 
with 
its 30,000 or so nuclear warheads and its 2 million men under 
arms, regards itself as a "Eurasian" power and not simply as a 
European power. Zhirinovskiy, who received 25 percent of the 
votes in December 1993, and 75 percent of the Army's votes, 
dreams of conquering the south and of access to the Indian 
Ocean. Others aspire to regain a foothold in the Baltic from 
Kaliningrad and bases in Latvia; yet others are looking toward 
Poland and Romania, via Moldova. 
  In short, Russia is in turmoil and, although it is true that 
the people are primarily concerned with feeding themselves and 
coping with the numerous problems of everyday life, the standard 
of living being only the equivalent of around 500 francs per 
month, the politicians are working to ensure respect for Russia 
and demanding for it preferential status in Europe in face of 
the Atlantic alliance. 
  This confrontational attitude merely strengthens the malaise 
and fear of the countries on the European fringes, former 
satellites of the USSR, which are now enjoying the taste of 
freedom. We should not be surprised at the fact that the former 
Communists, now back in power in Bulgaria and Poland, are 
demanding, like those of Romania and Slovakia, or like the 
moderate leaders of the Czech Republic or Hungary, immediate or 
almost immediate entry into NATO. As president of the NATO 
Assembly, I have met with them and they have all begged me to 
ensure that the Partnership for Peace, which they immediately 
signed, should be the first step leading to full integration 
into NATO, which Russia obviously does not want at any cost. 
  Scarcely five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
Europe 
is once again facing its old demons of extreme nationalism, 
xenophobia, wars of religion, ostracism, and rivalry based on 
the desire for power. 
  Bosnia, this terrible sore on the flank of our continent, 
will poison interstate relations for a long time. West Europe's 
inability to take action when there was still time, the 
spectacle of Europe's squabbling over Maastricht and expansion, 
mean that Europe is likely to remain a dwarf on the 
international chessboard and that, once again, as was the case 
for 45 years, the decisions are made in Washington and Moscow. 
  I draw two conclusions from that which strike me as crystal 
clear. 
  The first is that, in this dangerous world fraught with many 
threats, France is right not to drop its military guard and to 
propose a Military Programming Law which strengthens our defense 
and our ability to intervene. 
  The second is that France is right to make every effort to 
ensure that the European Union, on the basis of the 
Franco-German tandem, asserts itself economically, politically, 
and militarily and is capable of imposing itself as a factor of 
stability and security in Europe. (Footnote) (Loic Bouvard has 
recently made a trip to East and Central Europe, where he 
visited Prague, Bratislava, Warsaw, and Moscow.)

<F P=106> [Article by Wio Joustra: "Greeks Will Allow No Delays in </F>
Succession to Delors"] 
  [Text] Greece, which is currently assuming the presidency 
of the European Union (EU), wants the succession to Jacques 
Delors as president of the European Commission (EC) to be 
settled at the European summit in Corfu on 24 and 25 June. The 
Greeks are not expecting any postponement in the appointment or 
a veto from one or more countries against specific candidacies. 
  Pangalos, Greek minister for European affairs, spoke of 
Greece's position in The Hague on Wednesday [15 June], after a 
discussion with outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers and other 
cabinet members. Pangalos said that "the decision could not be 
postponed because of agreements with the European Parliament 
(EP), which has to ratify the European Council's choice." He 
added that "a long discussion about individuals would be 
fruitless and would have a negative effect on public opinion." 
  Pangalos said nothing about any Greek preference for one of 
the candidates. In any case, Greece will not put anyone forward 
at Corfu. Pangalos, who is traveling round the EU capitals in 
preparation of the EU summit, admitted there was a problem for 
the council of government leaders. "We do not know which is the 
best choice among three excellent possibilities," he said. 
  He referred to the candidacies of Lubbers, British European 
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene. Although the latter has not put himself 
forward as a candidate, he can count on the support of Bonn and 
Paris. In The Hague, Pangalos emphasized the neutrality of the 
presidency, which will be taken over by Germany on 1 July. For 
now, there is no consensus among members states on who should 
succeed Delors. There is little chance that the Christian 
Democrats, whose "turn" it now is, will make a choice between 
Lubbers and Dehaene before Corfu. 
  An attempt to mediate at the Benelux level by Martens, 
Belgian president of the European People's Party (EPP), seems 
doomed to failure at present. The EPP, which gathers together 
the European Christian Democrats, will meet in Brussels next 
Wednesday. Unless Lubbers or Dehaene withdraws, then the battle 
between the Netherlands and Belgian candidates will be decided 
at Corfu. 
  Despite the Greek aversion to any postponement, diplomatic 
circles in The Hague are taking real account of this 
possibility. In their opinion, postponement would become 
virtually inevitable if the Lubbers-Dehaene duel were to end in 
a narrow victory for one of them. To avoid loss of face for 
either camp, Germany, which will assume the presidency, could 
then decide to hold an extra summit in September. 
  Pangalos said that Greece and the Netherlands agreed that 
the 
decision of the EC presidency was not linked with "other 
international institutions or activities." But it was on 
Wednesday that rumors about the European jobs issue increased. 
  The names of former Netherlands Finance Minister Ruding and 
Van Rooy, Netherlands state secretary for economic affairs, 
suddenly appeared in the rumor mill. They were said to be 
candidates respectively for the secretary general position of 
the OECD and the WTO [World Trade Organization], which on 1 
January 1995 will take over from GATT. 
  The rumors are strongly denied in government circles. Ruding 
reportedly refuses to give up his job as second in command at 
the powerful American Bank Citycorp in New York. Van Rooy, who 
was second on the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] list of 
candidates in the parliamentary elections on 3 May, wants to 
deepen her experience in national politics. 
  The Netherlands supports Lawson, former British chancellor 
of 
the exchequer, for the OECD position and Mexican President 
Salinas for the WTO position. But The Hague is putting forward 
a top civil servant for a second-rank position in the WTO: 
Engering, director general of the Foreign Economic Relations 
Department of the Economic Affairs Ministry.

<F P=106> [Report by Chris Endean and Victor Smart: "Bold Berlusconi </F>
Aims To Exploit His Euro Power"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
exultant after his massive re-endorsement in the Euro elections, 
has begun a systematic campaign to assert his country's 
influence in European Union [EU] policy-making. 
  Other European leaders are now acutely aware that not only 
does Berlusconi have the freshest and most enthusiastic mandate 
of any European leader, but that he may not abide by the 
time-honoured rules of the old "European establishment." 
Although he clearly intends to keep other heads of government 
guessing about his true intentions, strong diplomatic signals 
emerging from Rome indicate that Berlusconi will play his cards 
ruthlessly in Italy's national interest. 
  Far from being able to write Berlusconi off as a 
non-politician who may have only temporary support and some 
uncomfortable neo-Fascist allies, Europe's established leaders 
have suddenly recognised that the populist chord he has struck 
may have implications for them as well. Most significant are 
the overtures made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to woo Berlusconi 
into the political mainstream. 
  After a meeting in Bonn with Kohl scheduled on 15 June, the 
tycoon-turned-politician can be confident that his maverick 
party, born only a few months ago from a network of football fan 
clubs, can count on a warm welcome into the political 
establishment. 
  With 27 Euro seats, Berlusconi's Forza Italia would 
constitute one of the most prominent national contingents within 
the dominant right-wing grouping at Strasbourg, the European 
People's Party (EPP). Traditionally this has been the home of 
moderate Christian Democrat parties across Europe. 
  Senator Livio Caputo, Rome's deputy foreign minister, told 
The European: "I know that Kohl is very keen on Forza Italia 
entering the EPP. Berlusconi wants to adhere to the EPP to 
maximise its power in Parliament, and so far we have received no 
negative signals." 
  Berlusconi's men would outnumber the discredited Italian 
Christian Democrats in the European Parliament by nearly three 
to one. And they would help close the gap at Strasbourg between 
the EPP and the Socialists, the largest single party. 
  Caputo explained: "With one-sixth of the Right's vote in 
Strasbourg, we carry a certain weight. The latest election 
result shows other governments and public opinion that 
Berlusconi did not win by chance but thanks to exceptional 
popular support. This will reinforce his position at next 
week's Corfu summit." 
  Bringing Forza Italia in from the cold, however, will throw 
up several obstacles. Certainly the biggest will be the 
necessity to accommodate the Italian government's new, more 
nationally assertive tone on European affairs. For many years 
Italy has been an uncritical supporter of the ideal of a federal 
Europe, inclined to press its own national interests within the 
EU only weakly. But that is changing rapidly, with some top 
ministers in Rome championing the EU predominantly as a 
free-trade zone. Antonio Martino, the foreign affairs minister, 
a founder member of the anti-federal Bruges Group, said 
recently: "We want a new direction on Europe -- something more 
market-oriented." 
  Since the EPP is an avowedly federalist party, to avoid 
embarrassment the Berlusconi forces may ally themselves rather 
than joining the group outright. This ploy was adopted in the 
last parliament by the British Conservative MEPs, who are 
expected to resort to the same tactic again now that British 
premier John Major has assumed a distinctly Eurosceptical tone. 
Caputo admits that Forza Italia is "likely to see eye-to-eye" 
with Britain's Euro-sceptics on several issues, notably the 
Maastricht treaty's social chapter. 
  "The social chapter must be handled with care," he said. 
"Excessive social policies, including more pensions and state 
handouts, could become a great burden in the future. Instead 
Europe must look to become more competitive vis-a-vis the United 
States and southeast Asia." 
  In a sign of its growing influence in Europe, Berlusconi's 
party is already being courted by contenders for the presidency 
of the EU Commission. Caputo makes it clear that the new Rome 
government will shed few tears when Jacques Delors leaves the 
post. "The new Commission will not be led by a socialist -- and 
I believe that the new European Parliament will oppose the 
dirigisme which has emanated from Brussels in the past few 
years," he declared. 
  Since its election in May, Berlusconi's administration has 
suffered a series of snubs from senior EU politicians worried by 
its alliance with the neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement]. 
Caputo dismisses this as a smoke-screen by the French socialists 
and the Belgians to mask their own domestic failures. 
  Even so, Forza Italia will not be allying with the handful 
of 
MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] the MSI is sending to 
Strasbourg. Before Forza Italia makes a deal with the EPP, both 
sides must be satisfied on institutional appointments. There 
are more than 40 top jobs to be handed out under a system of 
party patronage, and Forza Italia may argue it should have at 
least one key post.

  [Text] Holger K. Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist 
People's Party (SF), has issued a companion volume to Liberal 
Anders Fogh Rasmussen's topical book. The two are more in 
agreement than one might have thought. 
  SF chairman Nielsen declares that he is still a Marxist. 
Nevertheless he agrees with Rasmussen about many things and the 
respect is mutual. 
  Allow me to present the new Christiansborg [parliament

Party and superliberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen. 
  They disagree enormously politically, and their styles are 
unusually different. But at the same time they share so many 
attitudes and viewpoints that one ventures to make the assertion 
anyway: 
  Nielsen and Rasmussen are joined in a strange alliance. 
  In the next few months Danes will be able to see for 
themselves. The two will travel around the country on a joint 
lecture tour, and while the obligatory disagreements will 
undoubtedly be aired once again, the two politicians will also 
stress their favorite common themes to an equally large 
extent: 

  -  The political debate has become mushy. 
  -  Too few 
people today have the courage to take a clear ideological 
stand. 
  -  The Social Democrats are the worst offenders. 

  Before the tour of Denmark begins, BERLINGSKE TIDENDE made 
an 
appointment to meet the two politicians. To talk about visions, 
but also about their topical books: 
  Rasmussen's highly ideological book, Fra Socialstat til 
minimalstat [From Welfare State to Minimal State] came out 
last fall. And Nielsen's book of the same cast and appearance, 
but with a somewhat different final result, Frihed i 
faellesskab [Freedom in Fellowship], will be available in 
bookstores on Tuesday [26 April]. And you have to look closely 
at what is written on the book jackets because the two books are 
almost indistinguishable. 
  The two have the same publisher -- Samleren -- and the dust 
jackets are practically identical. And as if that were not 
enough, there is actually an advertisement for Rasmussen's very 
liberal book on the back of Nielsen's book. 
  Both authors now hope the books can be sold together as a 
kind of package solution. 
  Future purchasers of this odd book package can read about 
Rasmussen's frontal assault on the welfare state. And if the 
same readers then open the second publication in the package 
they can become acquainted with Nielsen's total repudiation of 
Rasmussen's social views. 
  Actually, Nielsen himself says he has written a Marxist 
book. 
  However that is not the point, both authors agree. 
  For if all the external trappings are peeled away, one thing 
remains: Both Nielsen and Rasmussen are full of praise for each 
other's work. 
  "Actually, you have written a pretty good book, Holger," 
Rasmussen says and continues: 
  "I notice that you bury the class struggle. Perhaps somewhat 
guardedly, but you do." 
<H5>  Marxism </H5>
  Normally this kind of praise -- especially when it comes 
from 
a Liberal -- would be somewhat doubtful for an SF man. And lest 
Rasmussen think a miracle has occurred, Nielsen makes sure to 
point out: 
  "I am a Marxist. Socialism may have a low status 
in many quarters, but it still exists in my mind." 
  But after that has been established Nielsen does not want to 
lag behind Rasmussen. The SF chairman also has praise for his 
political opponent: 
  "I like Anders' book because it is clear. I tried to prove 
that ideology is not dead. And Anders does the same. I like him 
for that," Nielsen says. 
  The easiest thing, of course, would have been to dismiss 
each 
other's book. Rasmussen could have zeroed in on Nielsen's 
continued profession of Marxism. Similarly, Nielsen could have 
focused exclusively on the Liberal ideologist's praise of 
private initiative. 
  Instead they have chosen to do almost the opposite. Of 
course 
they have to taunt each other, but each will also get the praise 
he deserves. 
  Rasmussen: "I make it a point to emphasize my agreement with 
Holger. I think people are tired of the brick wall that many 
political books run into. Surely we can afford to agree with 
each other even if we are political opponents. The most 
important thing is that political thinking occurs at all. So we 
should not go around sniping at each other's book." 
<H5>  The State </H5>
  Rasmussen likes the very title of Nielsen's book: 
  "Freedom in Fellowship brings back a lot of 
memories of my days in VU [Liberal Youth]. Our slogan was 
exactly the same back then. So that is definitely a good 
beginning." 
  Nielsen promptly repays the compliment: 
  "I would also like to praise you, Anders. In you and your 
book we see for once a politician who goes into depth about 
something ideological. That is also the reason why the book is 
so much fun to rebut." 
  And so he does -- the SF chairman. With the characteristic 
half-affectionate, half-teasing undertone that conceals great 
respect as a rule, Nielsen tackles Rasmussen's most central 
assertions: 
  First and foremost the one about the excellence of the free 
market mechanism. 
  "There is a difference between a market economy and 
democracy. Your view is just too primitive, Anders." 
  Rasmussen: "I attack the socialists because they believe 
that 
political management is faultless. I call for some humility 
there. The market economy is the only system that gives people a 
free rein to strive for the good life." 
  So much for the market economy, but there are plenty of 
points on which the liberal and the socialist speak the same 
language and understand each other. 
  Such as the question of the state, for example. In his book, 
Nielsen maintains that there are limits, after all, to growth in 
the public sector. 
  Rasmussen: "That is a very important realization, Holger. 
You 
should spell this out for your support troops. It is interesting 
and very encouraging that you come to grips with the concept of 
the state. You want to shift tasks from the state to `civil 
society.' That is what I call private initiative. But the words 
should not keep us apart." 
<H5>  Freedom </H5>
  The concept of freedom is another example of what they have 
in common: 
  Nielsen: "It is very important that SF not lose the concept 
of freedom to the nonsocialists. It must not be said that the 
Liberal Party has a monopoly on freedom, while we are left 
behind, representing everything authoritative." 
  Rasmussen: "The very fact that you found it necessary to use 
the word `freedom' in your title confirms that the socialists 
find it necessary to argue on liberal terms." 
  But probably the most important similarity is their strong 
shared belief in the value of always expressing standpoints 
clearly. 
  Both politicians loathe colleagues who shrink from 
ideological and long-range discussions in favor of the familiar 
Christiansborg pragmatism. Both Rasmussen and Nielsen fear that 
Danish politics will become a little boring with no one 
underlining clear standpoints. 
  "The kind of discussion where it is hard to tell if a Social 
Democrat or a Conservative is speaking is deadly. The whole 
thing becomes a confrontation between mush and mush." 
  Nielsen and Rasmussen agree that the Social Democrats are 
the 
worst -- the mushiest. 
  Nielsen: "With the exception of Ritt Bjerregaard there are 
no 
real thinkers in the Social Democratic Party. For them it has 
become a question of power for power's sake -- and otherwise 
they are indifferent to substance. There, in my opinion, they 
differ sharply from their fellow parties in Sweden, France, and 
Germany." 
  Rasmussen: "On this point I agree 100 percent. It is 
striking 
how all the political mush is found in the opposition -- among 
us and the SF people. The Social Democrats managed to create a 
welfare state in the course of a few decades and then came to a 
complete standstill in other respects. Today they regard 
defending what they once created as their sole and highly 
distinguished task." 
  The covers of both books display pictures of trees on green 
fields against a background of blue sky. But -- despite the 
similarity -- there are differences: 
  Nielsen's field appears to be more ecological than 
Rasmussen's, which primarily gives the impression of being very 
well watered. 
  And there is only one tree -- though a very lovely one -- on 
Rasmussen's book. Nielsen's book is decorated with several -- 
though they are hardly as resplendent. 
  What should we infer from that? 
  First Nielsen: 
  "Anders probably chose the single tree to show the 
possibilities of the individual. I would rather stress that the 
individual is connected with the community." 
  Rasmussen: "I must first note that Holger's group of trees 
looks somewhat bedraggled. That must say something about the 
fact that when trees -- or people -- shade each other they 
become small and somewhat stunted." 
  And they can continue in this way in the months ahead -- 
Danish politics' new fast friends, Holger K. Nielsen and Anders 
Fogh Rasmussen.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will focus 
on a new plan to help get the confidence-building measures 
accepted and implemented. A Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation 
correspondent reported from New York that according to 
well-informed sources, the UN secretary general will send 
letters to the two sides in Cyprus explaining the manner to 
implement the confidence-building measures and will refer 
extensively to the benefits for the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  According to the same sources, the UN secretary general will 
proceed with this move if he decides that Turkish Cypriot leader 
Rauf Denktas has given a positive reply to the 21 March UN 
document, based on the briefing by Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus. 
Denktas seems unwilling to accept this procedure, but 
Butrus-Ghali appears determined to send his letters. 
  During their meeting yesterday, the UN secretary general 
informed Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis of his intention. 
The Cypriot delegation at the United Nations is skeptical about 
the effectiveness of the UN secretary general's move and 
expresses the conviction that the impression that Denktas will 
accept the confidence-building measures is an illusion. 
  Mikhailidhis said it is crystal clear in the UN secretary 
general's mind that, despite the course of negotiations on the 
confidence-building measures, the substance of the Cyprus issue 
must be discussed without delay. The foreign minister added that 
the United Nations began forming a picture about the next steps, 
which will be finalized once Feissel's report on his latest 
meeting with Denktas is conveyed. 
  The foreign minister had a one-hour meeting with 
Butrus-Ghali 
in New York and later held separate meetings with the British 
and U.S. permanent UN representatives. Mikhailidhis left New 
York last night to return to Cyprus. He will be in London today 
where he will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
  The UN secretary general's spokesman, Joe Sills, said that 
all aspects of the Cyprus issue--including the 
confidence-building measures, other substantive issues, and the 
UN secretary general's good offices mission--were discussed at 
the meeting between Butrus-Ghali and the foreign minister. The 
spokesman added that the United Nations continues to feel that 
the confidence-building measures are balanced and offer 
advantages to both sides. 
  Asked if Denktas accepted the confidence-building measures 
during his meeting with Feissel, Sills said the UN secretary 
general is awaiting his representative's briefing.

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "The Greece-PKK Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--The tension between Turkey and Greece, which 
has been created as a result of the support Greek officials give 
to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] and the Greek intention 
to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean Sea to 12 miles, 
is continuing. Meanwhile, the support Greek officials have 
given to the PKK has come to light. In a report to the Prime 
Minister's Office some time ago, the officials explained how 
Greece uses the PKK to ax the Turkish tourism sector, which has 
become a serious rival to the Greek tourist industry, and the 
financial aid that country gives to the PKK sympathizers. Last 
week, President Suleyman Demirel sent a letter to President 
Konstandinos Karamanlis based on that report. He also furnished 
Karamanlis with an intelligence report on PKK activities in 
Greece. The report and the letter outline the names of the 
Greek Government officials who have contacted several PKK 
members, and discloses the dates those contacts were made. For 
example, the report revealed that Kharalambidhis, one of Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou's advisers, met with PKK leader 
Abdullan Ocalan some time ago and promised to establish a 
shipping agency in order to transport arms from Athens to the 
PKK. 
<H5>  Evidence </H5>
  The report outlined information on the support Greece gives 
to the PKK as follows: 
  1. Former Foreign Minister Andonios Samaras held secret 
talks 
with the PKK's ERNK [Kurdish People's Liberation Front] 
representative in Athens on 6 and 7 June 1991. 
  2. Following talks between the two sides, the Greek Ministry 
of Public Order instructed the immigration department, in 
writing, not to create problems for the PKK militants when they 
enter or leave Greece. In fact, 50 PKK militants entered Greece 
with no obstruction after they crossed the Maritsa River on 20 
July 1991. 
  3. Greek Deputies Mikhalis Galenianos, Elevtherios 
Verivakis, 
Elisavet Papazoi, Dhimitrios Vonatsos, and Elevtherios Verivakis 
met Abdullah Ocalan in Lebanon in October 1991. Speaking on TV 
Channel 29 after returning to Greece, they claimed that the PKK 
is not a terrorist organization and argued that it is waging a 
national liberation struggle. 
  4. Greece allows PKK militants to work as highly paid 
seamen. Some 25 percent of the wages paid to the militants is 
donated to the ERNK office. 
  5. In a statement to the Greek Cypriot daily O 
FILELEVTHEROS, Ocalan has claimed that the Kurds have reduced 
the strength of Turkey's threat to Cyprus and Greece. 
  6. Members of the PKK office in Athens cooperate with the 
EYP [Greek secret service organization]. They have infiltrated 
the Macedonian community in Greece to inform the EYP of its 
activities. 
  7. The first plan to hit Turkey's tourism sector, which 
grows every year, was drawn up in 1992. Several retired Greek 
officers, who work with the Greek secret service organization, 
met with the PKK members in Greece to draw up a plan to sabotage 
Turkey's tourism industry in that year. Their plan was put into 
effect in 1993. 
  8. PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] Deputies 
Verivakis, Kaloyianni, and Makhouris argued in a program on TV 
Channel 19 that Greece should support the PKK against Turkey. 
  9. Greek Deputy Alexandros Alavanos was arrested for trying 
to prevent the arrest of two members of a PKK group, which 
occupied the European Parliament during the ceremonies held to 
mark Nevruz in March 1992, by helping them to escape in his car. 
However, he was released because of his diplomatic immunity. 
  10. In a statement to the KURDISTAN REPORT, retired Admiral 
Andonios Nakhakis argued that the Greek people should cooperate 
with the PKK. 
  11. An account has been opened in the Greek National Bank's 
branch in Kaningos for the PKK militants in the camp on Lavrion 
Island. The account number is: 129/62639077. Two PKK 
militants, Samil Asmaad and Sinan Aslan, are taking care of the 
Kurdish people's affairs in Greece. 
  12. Under Secretary of the Greek Foreign Ministry Viryinia 
Tsoudherou claimed in May 1992 that the EC should support the 
Kurds. 
  13. The refugee camp on Lavrion Island, which is 70 km from 
Athens in the southeastern part of Greece, has been allocated to 
the PKK militants. The PKK maintains its activities through the 
Kurdistan Committee in Athens and the ERNK office. 
  14. The radio channel, which is known as the Voice of 
Kurdistan, is operated by the PKK. 
  15. Greek officials pay 30,000 Greek drachmas monthly to the 
ERNK members. 
  16. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides 
scholarships to 33 PKK members in Greece. 
  17. The mayor of Athens attended the Congress of Kurds in 
Bonn some time ago. The prime minister of Lower Saxony also 
attended that convocation. The Greek mayor argued that a 
Kurdish State should be established. 
  18. Deputies Dhimitrios Vonatsos, Elisavet Papazoi, Andonios 
Makhasis, and Kostas Dhimitris held a press conference in the 
ERNK office in Athens on 25 June 1993. A retired admiral held a 
news conference with several PKK militants on Kos Island on 8 
July. 
  19. Some 100 Greek drachmas are transferred to an account in 
the Ethniki Bank for the PKK militants. (The overall amount in 
that account is rather high) 
  20. A PKK delegation called on Minister of Public Order 
Stilianos Papathemelis on 14 October 1993. It asked that the 
officials facilitate the formalities for the PKK militants when 
they enter or leave Greece. 
  21. The ERNK office and the Kurdistan Committee are based in 
Athens. Their address is: 72/1 Ipokratis Avenue, Athens. 
However, the Greek Government has persistently denied their 
existence. 
  22. Kharalambidhis, who is one of Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's advisers, held talks with Abdullah Ocalan in the 
al-Biqa' Valley in Lebanon some time ago. He promised to see to 
it that a shipping agency is established in Greece to facilitate 
the supply of arms to the PKK. He also promised to help that 
organization acquire arms and explosives, establish an 
import-export company as a front for that purpose, acquire 
forged passports, facilitate the entry of its militants who are 
expelled from foreign countries, and provide ideological 
training for the Kurds. As a result of Haralambidhis' meeting 
with Ocalan, ideological training courses have been organized 
for the PKK militants in the camps in Athens and Piraievs. The 
militants are dispatched to the al-Biqa' Valley after receiving 
ideological training for six months. 
  23. A ship with a cargo of arms for the PKK was dispatched 
from Greece to the Port of Latakia in Syria in May 1992. 
  24. Former Foreign Minister Andonios Samaras instructed the 
donation of 10 million dollars from Greece's secret funds to the 
PKK. 
  25. Greece allocates 1 million dollars for the PKK in 
support of its campaign to prevent tourists from visiting Turkey. 
  26. A group of Greek deputies visited Lice some time ago at 
the invitation of the PKK. When Deputy Dhimitrios Vonatsos 
returned to Greece he said the following: "Had it not been for 
the PKK, the two army corps in Diyarbakir would have been based 
in the Aegean region." 
  27. A group of Greek deputies attended the Democracy Party 
Congress in Ankara some time ago. They promised to support that 
party.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "CSCE: High Officials, Experts To </F>
Move on Crimean Crisis"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 15 -- High-ranking officials from 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as well as 
experts in economics and constitutional affairs are to be 
dispatched to the Crimea in the hope of helping negotiations 
between Crimea and the Ukrainian authorities, a statement said 
here this evening. 
  Issued by the Italian Foreign Ministry because Italy is the 
CSCE's duty president, the statement said a meeting of the 
CSCE's committee of high-ranking officials in Prague decided 
that a top CSCE official would be sent to central Asia for a 
year on a "permanent liaison" mission. This posting and the 
mission to the Crimea were designed as an act of preventive 
diplomacy, the CSCE's "primary and qualifying" task, the 
statement here asserted. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, the permanent mission's 
aim was also to act as backup for the experts as they seek to 
ease talks between Kiev and the authorities in Simferopol, the 
capital of the Crimea which became an autonomous republic within 
the Ukraine in 1954. The aim of the talks is to improve power 
sharing and joint moves to improve the Crimea's economic growth 
prospects. 
  In the last couple of years, the Crimea, a peninsula on the 
Black Sea with a major naval base at Sevastopol and place names 
such as Balaklava and Yalta, has been seeking its independence, 
or at least closer ties with Russia from which its ethnic 
majority comes. 
  A major stumbling block has been the ex-Soviet naval bases 
at 
Sevastapol and other ports. Both Russia and the Ukraine have 
laid claim to the ex-Soviet Black Sea navy, but now negotiations 
to divide it seem to be on the right path. 
  Early this month, CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities Max 
van der Stoel was shuttling between Moscow and Kiev when Crimean 
and Ukrainian delegations were negotiating on the problems 
raised by an April referendum in which Crimeans voted by a large 
majority for closer relations with Russia, and by the approval 
in May of a 1992 constitution with apparently secessionist 
provisions, among them one allowing for dual citizenship. 
  "The ways and possibilities for finding a solution are 
sufficient, the only problem is to want to use them" said Van 
der Stoel, who was also full of praise for the Ukraine's policy 
on ethnic minorities. 
  Negotiations are still going on to reconcile the new Crimean 
constitution with Ukraine's, without touching Ukrainian 
territorial integrity, a basic principle reasserted today by the 
CSCE, which reiterated its commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty 
and territorial integrity and the inviolability of its frontiers. 
  According to the statement here, the CSCE also called on the 
Crimean authorities to avoid any act that could aggravate the 
situation and endanger negotiations. 
  The meeting in Prague also began preparations for the CSCE 
summit to be held in Budapest in December, an occasion to which 
South Korea will also be invited as an observer. 
  (Italian Ambassador Paolo Bruno, who chaired the meeting in 
Prague, told reporters there that other decisions and 
recommendations covered joint CSCE-Commonwealth of Independent 
States monitoring missions in Abkhazia and Nagorno-Karabakh as 
well as CSCE monitoring in Moldova and Bosnia.) 
  (He said the meeting also decided to return the missions to 
Voivodina and Kosovo.) 
  (The Vatican delegation asked for Serbia-Montenegro's 
readmission. The federated republic was suspended because of 
the Bosnian war.) 
  (The ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia was also kept in its 
status as observer due to Greek opposition to full membership.)

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "NATO Air Forces Participate in </F>
`Central Enterprise' Exercise"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 14 June (BELGA) -- NATO Air Forces in 
Western Europe began a major annual exercise on Monday [13 June] 
that will end on Friday, military sources report. 
  Known as "Central Enterprise," this maneuver involves 
German, 
Belgian, Danish, Italian, Netherlands, Spanish, and U.S. 
aircraft and pilots, the allied air forces' Ramstein 
headquarters in Center-Europe has announced. 
  France, which is not included in NATO's integrated military 
structure, is taking part in the exercise "in the framework of 
the normal training relations" it maintains with its allies, the 
same source stated in a communique. 
  This is thus the first time that nine countries are taking 
part in a "Central Enterprise," including Denmark (which has 
been part of the so-called Center-Europe region since 1 January) 
and Spain. 
  For the occasion, U.S. F-15 fighters have been dispatched to 
France, the first time this has happened since it withdrew from 
NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. These aircraft 
are based in Cambrai (north), a French Air Force spokesman 
indicated. 
  The NATO communique states that the exercise zone will 
extend 
over the Benelux countries, Denmark, certain areas of Germany, 
northern and central France, the Baltic, and eastern Great 
Britain. 
  Due to political and military change in Europe in recent 
years, "Central Enterprise" will involve significantly fewer 
daily flights than on previous occasions, the communique states. 
The communique ends by stating that planes will fly during the 
day only and the exercise should not mean any more activity in 
the air than during a normal training day. 
  Some 300 U.S. reserves and nine C-130 "Hercules" transport 
planes were dispatched to Chievres (between Mons and Ath) last 
Sunday for a period of almost two weeks ending on Friday. These 
pilots belong to the National Guard (reserve).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bank for International Settlements </F>
Sees Italy's Options as Limited"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Basel, June 13 -- The high ratio of 
Italy's primary deficit over its gross domestic product, 
together with its pension costs which will swell when the 
"baby-boomer" generation retires, leaves it little room to 
maneuver in order to benefit from automatic stabilizers, 
according to the latest report from the Bank for International 
Settlements (BIS). 
  These problems are also on the horizon for other 
industrialized countries, with the exception of Japan and 
Ireland, which over the past four years have eased public debt 
pressure on the GDP, but they are particularly evident in Italy 
where the deficit is far above the GDP and pension costs 
represent 21 percent of public spending, the highest among the 
Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized countries. 
  The pension question in Italy will become even more serious 
following last week's ruling by the Italian supreme 
Constitutional Court that even those with more than one pension 
could benefit from minimum pension treatment. A ruling that was 
retroactive to 1984 and could cost Italy as much as 10 billion 
dollars. 
  According to BIS calculations, the pressure of pension costs 
on the Italian GDP will double in 50 years, passing from 11 
percent in 1990 to 22 percent in the year 2040. 
  Italy, like many other countries, is seeking to raise the 
retirement age, reduce benefits and introduce retirement funds. 
These measures, the BIS pointed out, aim at defusing the pension 
"bomb" and give public budget more flexibility. 
  "Given the future pressure caused by the general aging of 
the 
population" the BIS report said, "and the pressure this will 
exert on public spending, a phenomena which has already hurt the 
credibility of economic authorities in the current recessive 
phase, many governments will have no choice except move towards 
tight fiscal policies which aim at consolidating the debt to 
ward off undesired effects on financial markets". 
  Last year, the BIS report recalled using OECD data, Italy's 
net deficit reached 112 percent of its GDP, up fro 96 percent in 
1989, greater than the average 10 percentage point growth among 
G-7 countries. 
  The BIS also warned about the "vulnerability" of public debt 
in connection with interest rates, stressing how "In Italy some 
65 percent of the deficit is at short-term rates or at an index 
adjusted rate. This makes it highly susceptible to rate 
fluctuation," as demonstrated in the 1992-93 currency crisis. 
  "The credibility of economic authorities and budget plans" 
the BIS report observed, "plays an essential role in determining 
changes in fiscal policies. Medium-term budget plans, in order 
to have an effect on the level of debt, public spending and 
interest rates, must generate positive expectations." [passage

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB/MPK: "Lubbers: Paris Prefers Dehaene </F>
To Succeed Delors"] 
  [Text] Paris/The Hague, 14 June (BELGA/ANP) -- "Paris has a 
slight preference for Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene to 
succeed Jacques Delors at the head of the European Commission 
(EC)," Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers stated on Tuesday 
[14 June] evening. 
  "French President Mitterrand is seeking a consensus; if 
there 
is not a consensus for Mr. Dehaene, then it could be someone 
else," Mr. Lubbers affirmed. "My candidacy does not pose any 
problems for President Mitterrand," he added following an 
hour-long meeting with President Mitterrand at the Elysee. 
  The head of the Netherlands Government nevertheless 
described 
his meeting with President Mitterrand as "good." Last week Mr. 
Lubbers met with French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. "This 
time, we discussed matters in more detail," Mr. Lubbers added. 
  Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou, 
Greek state secretary for foreign affairs, are to visit The 
Hague on Tuesday evening. They are due to meet with Mr. Lubbers 
and Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. 
  The issue of Mr. Jacques Delors' successor as EC president 
is 
to be discussed at these meetings. The visit is a routine visit 
which the Greek presidency of the European Union (EU) is making 
to all EU member states to prepare for the Corfu Summit next 24 
and 25 June.

<F P=106> [Article by Pertti Salolainen, Finland's foreign trade </F>
minister and negotiator on EU affairs: "Making the Union Truly 
Pan-European"] 
  [Text] In 1923, the Bohemian Count Richard 
Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote in his book Pan Europa: "To 
rationalise the European economy we have to create an internal 
European market. Only that way can Europe achieve high wages, 
low prices and great turnover." Already during those chaotic 
days after the Great War, economic convergence was seen by many 
as the only means to ensure lasting peace and prosperity. 
  Today a single market exists for the European Union [EU]. 
Additionally, we have created the European Economic Area, by 
which the single market is extended to the wealthier European 
non-EU countries. The EU has negotiated co-operation agreements 
with central and eastern Europe. 
  However, the real question is whether the European Union 
will 
some day become pan-European. I believe that the real 
Europeanism of the 21st century must embrace and extend the 
values of liberalism, pluralism, tolerance, and rationality 
throughout the continent. 
  A multi-track Europe is already more a reality than a 
threat. 
EU divergences are apparent. It is difficult to see how all 
the present member states could satisfy the criteria for the 
adoption of a single currency by January 1 1999. In the 
Visegrad countries, or the former Soviet Union, the picture is 
still more fragmented. 
  The EU should be genuinely open to all European nations that 
share the common ideals of peace and prosperity. The question 
of when and how steps to enlarge the EU should be taken has to 
be solved case-by-case. The Union must function efficiently and 
in a co-ordinated way. Our aim is to promote forward-looking 
co- operation. 
  Finland's membership of the European Union is a matter of 
stability and independence. Stability, because Europe needs the 
kind of stability that only integrated co-operation can produce. 
Independence because by joining the EU we can best influence our 
own destinies. 
  For Europe, Finland's membership will strengthen the EU's 
role as a political and economic anchor. 
  On October 16, we will be holding a national referendum on 
EU 
membership. Under the Finnish constitution, such a referendum 
is only advisory but the Finnish government will consider the 
outcome politically binding. 
  Sceptics must realise that in an interdependent world no 
nation can survive in isolation. That was also the lesson of 
the Austrian referendum result on Sunday, which I warmly welcome. 
  To preserve sovereignty, Finland needs a secure, equitable 
place in the decision-making process that will decide its future.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with European Competition Commissioner </F>
Karel van Miert by Paul Betts; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The fiasco over the European Commission's rescue 
plan for the steel industry has left Mr Karel van Miert, the 
normally genial European competition commissioner, in an angry 
and combative mood. It also seems to have stirred the Flemish 
socialist to pursue even more vigorously than his free-market 
conservative predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, competition abuses 
in the single market. 
  Mr van Miert feels he has been let down by governments which 
had originally asked him to draw up with Mr Martin Bangemann, 
the industry commissioner, a plan to cut European steel 
capacity. "I was asked to put together a steel plan but I was 
never `demandeur' (Originator). If the feeling is that we 
should put an end to it, I'm prepared to do so," he said 
defiantly in an interview with the FINANCIAL TIMES. 
  Although governments are now scrambling to salvage the plan, 
Mr van Miert suggested the moves were unlikely to succeed but 
designed rather to give the whole affair "a decent burial." 
  For Mr van Miert, the steel affair reflects the 
contradictory 
and often hypocritical position of governments that ultimately 
undermines the entire European Union process. "It's very 
frustrating when you have to discuss with governments about 
capacity cuts, about state aid, when they all have a veto. It 
doesn't work. I mean, it's like a referee in a football game 
where he has to ask the player if he please may give him a 
yellow or a red card. That's the position the Commission has 
been facing on steel," he said. 
  And then governments, not least the UK, adopt completely 
contradictory positions. "We will be told we are well paid, 
which is true, perhaps even over-paid Eurocrats, and not 
politically responsible, and things like that. But the British 
government will ask Mr Bangemann and me officially and formally 
to use Article 90 to liberalise the telecommunications sector 
without parliament, without the Council of Ministers. Isn't 
that a very strange attitude?" he asks, referring to Article 90 
of the Treaty of Rome, known as the nuclear option, a rarely 
used provision which gives the Commission the power to break up 
public monopolies on competition grounds. 
  In some more liberal quarters, Mr van Miert's appointment 18 
months ago raised fears he would take a soft approach to 
competition issues. Instead he is confounding his doubters by 
initiating a broad series of competition cases involving 
everything from mergers and state aid to price fixing in sectors 
as varied as consumer goods, cement production, carton board, 
telecommunications, airlines and banking. 
  He is proposing to block a controversial takeover of a 
German 
feminine hygiene products company by Procter and Gamble of the 
U.S.: only the second deal to be blocked by the Commission since 
it was given wider powers to vet large mergers more than two 
years ago. 
  Mr van Miert, a former transport commissioner who engineered 
European air transport liberalisation, is also planning to 
attack ground handling monopolies at European airports. He is 
keeping an eye on the French government's proposed FFr20bn 
(2.3bn pounds) capital injection into Air France, the troubled 
French national carrier, and is pursuing a complaint by the 
small Irish carrier, Ryanair, against Aer Lingus, the Irish 
state nag carrier, of predatory pricing. 
  Mr van Miert is extremely concerned by the French 
government's plan to inject FFr4.9bn of capital into Credit 
Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks, and writing off FFr40bn 
of bad debts. In a novel approach to EU competition 
investigations, he is planning to appoint a panel of eminent 
independent bankers to advise him on the case. 
  From the beginning, Mr van Miert has adopted a pragmatic 
approach to competition issues. Just as he felt that the only 
way forward for the steel industry was a flexible plan linking 
state aid to the decommissioning of capacity, even though this 
might have been in a strict legal sense questionable, he 
believes the state has a role to play in areas, including big 
infrastructure programmes, where private investors do not want 
to invest. 
  But he is also convinced that the cause of liberalisation in 
Europe has been won, even in his own country of Belgium. Under 
the Commission's state aid policy for flag carriers, state-owned 
airlines have been allowed one last injection of state funds to 
help them adapt to the new liberalised aviation market and 
restructure their operations. 
  "Sabena (the Belgian national carrier) made losses for many, 
many years. Now they have had to adapt in a dramatic way to new 
circumstances. So we thought it was fair enough to give 
carriers a new chance. But just once." 
  Privatisation is also the only way ahead for large sectors 
of 
previously state-owned industries, including steel, 
telecommunications, airlines, among many others. "There is no 
reason why they should be state-owned," Mr Van Miert said. 
  "It is utterly unfair if in a given member state companies 
not receiving state aid are being put to the wall by those 
continuing to produce quite happily although in trouble because 
of state support," he said, adding that national bankruptcy laws 
also risked further distorting the market. 
  For all these reasons, it was important to give the 
Commission the necessary instruments to monitor competition. 
"If we are not equipped we must admit that we are unable to do 
so and then leave it to the gods," he said. "Once you go for 
liberalisation, you need a strong central authority to make the 
rules, implement them and respect them." 
  Equally, it was important to take a long-term view of 
competition and overall industrial policy, added Mr van Miert, a 
close friend of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. "I 
believe you have remain far-sighted. One of great strengths of 
Jacques Delors is that he senses I perhaps much more than many 
other people what will might be needed in years come. I believe 
very much that the next president of the Commission should be 
that kind of guy." Mr van Miert recalled how Mr Delors asked 
him draw up a new transport infrastructure network for Europe 
when he first took over transport portfolio. "I still keep the 
map he gave me on which he drew various lines and at least one 
tunnel."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. MEMO/94/38: "Partnership and Cooperation </F>
Agreement Between EU And Ukraine"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  History to the Agreement </H5>
  In October 1992 the EC Council of Ministers adopted 
negotiating directives for the negotiation of partnership and 
cooperation agreements with countries of the former Soviet 
Union. In 1993, three rounds of negotiations with Ukraine were 
held on the basis of these negotiating directives. On 7 March 
1994, the EU Council of Ministers agreed to extend the 
negotiating directives in order to meet a number of Ukrainian 
requests, notably in order to reflect the prospect of future 
free trade agreement. The enlarged mandate has enabled both 
sides to conclude the negotiations and initial the agreement 
today. The partnership agreement will replace the trade and 
cooperation agreement of 1989 between the EC and the Soviet 
Union as far as Ukraine is concerned. 
<H5>  Details of the Agreement </H5>
  General principles: The agreement underlines the importance 
of democratic values, respect for human rights and the 
principles of a market economy as essential elements of the 
partnership established between the European Union and Ukraine. 
The parties also consider it essential for future prosperity 
and stability in the region of the former Soviet Union that 
regional cooperation should be continued and strengthened. 
  The agreement establishes the prospect of a future free 
trade 
area. In 1998, Ukraine's progress towards a market economy will 
be assessed in order to see whether negotiations can begin 
towards free trade. 
  The preamble to the agreement states that support for the 
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine 
will contribute to safeguarding peace and stability in Central 
and Eastern Europe and the European Continent as a whole. 
  Political dialogue: the agreement foresees an intensive 
political dialogue, opening the way for meetings at the highest 
political level whenever appropriate 
  Trade in goods: In addition to the prospect of eventual free 
trade, both sides will offer each other "most-favoured-nation" 
(MFN) treatment, giving each other trading terms as good as 
those offered to other trading partners such as those in the 
GATT. Quotas will be removed, in line with the Community's new 
commercial defence policy, while specific agreements will be 
negotiated for coal and steel products and trade in nuclear 
materials. An agreement on trade in textile products is already 
in force. 
  Labour conditions: The agreement calls on the parties to 
prevent discrimination between legally employed workers, and 
provides for cumulation of pension rights for Ukrainian workers 
legally employed in various EU member states. 
  Establishment and operation of companies: The agreement 
establishes a liberal regime with Ukraine, offering MFN 
treatment or national treatment (i.e. treatment as good as that 
offered to domestic companies), whichever happens to be most 
favourable, when EU companies establish and begin operations on 
Ukrainian soil, with limited exceptions. 
  Services: The agreement aims at a progressive liberalisation 
of the cross-border supply of services between the parties. 
  Maritime transport: Each side will offer the other national 
treatment for access to ports which are open to international 
trade, as well as for the use of infrastructure and auxiliary 
maritime services, related fees and charges, customs facilities 
and the assignment of berths and loading facilities. 
  Payments and capital: For trade in goods, each side 
stipulates that imports may be paid for in freely convertible 
currency. This important measure prevents European exports from 
being submitted to general requirements on the use of local 
currency. In the case of direct investment, companies will be 
free to repatriate their profits in freely convertible currency, 
and no new foreign exchange restrictions will be introduced 
after the agreement enters into force. 
  Competition: The agreement lays down a number of principles 
aimed at gradually increasing free and non-discriminatory 
competition. 
  Intellectual property: Regarding the protection of 
intellectual, industrial and commercial property rights, the 
agreement provides that Ukraine will bring its levels of 
protection up to EU standards within five years of the agreement 
coming into force. 
  Economic cooperation: The agreement lists 25 areas where 
both sides favour economic cooperation in future. They are: 
industrial cooperation, investment promotion and protection, 
public procurement, standards and conformity assessments, mining 
and raw materials, science and technology, education and 
training, agriculture and agro-industrial sector, energy, civil 
nuclear sector (including cooperatIon on the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster), environment, transport, space, 
telecommunications, financial services, money laundering, 
monetary policy, regional development, social cooperation, 
tourism, small and medium sized enterprises, information and 
communication, consumer protection, customs, statistical 
cooperation, economics and drugs. 
  Cooperation in these fields may be supported as appropriate 
by technical assistance from the EU through the TACIS [technical 
assistance to CIS] programme. 
  Institutional framework: The agreement finally establishes 
an institutional framework for future cooperation including a 
cooperation council that shall meet at ministerial level once a 
year, as well as a parliamentary cooperation committee.

<F P=106> [Report by Tyll Necker, president of the Federation of </F>
German Industries: "German Presidency has New Dimension"] 
  [Text] The German government assumes the six-monthly 
presidency of the European Union [EU] next month at the same 
time as the fourth directly elected European Parliament takes up 
its duties. It does so at at time when, in line with the 
Maastricht treaty, the decision-making and supervisory powers of 
the newly elected parliament have been enlarged. 
  EU policies have taken on a significance for Germany that in 
many spheres is equivalent to that of national policies. More 
than 60 per cent of the legislation affecting business and 
consumer affairs is now determined at a European level, and is 
thus dependent on the European Parliament's decisions. To give 
the parliament a broad democratic basis, German industry made 
clear during the campaign that it favoured a high turnout in the 
elections on Sunday [12 June]. 
  The German presidency and the new parliament will be 
starting 
their work at a time of great political and economic challenge. 
  After the large-scale upheavals which have taken place in 
Europe during the last few years, including the reunification of 
Germany, the task now is to press forward along the path of 
European integration. 
  The main item on the agenda is to strengthen Europe's 
position as a centre for economic activity by overcoming points 
of structural weakness and reducing unemployment. 
  Last December, the European Council drew up an action plan 
based on the Commission's white paper on growth, 
competitiveness, and employment. That provides the foundations 
for a successful common strategy during the medium term, which 
should reinforce companies' competitiveness and increase 
employment. 
  Broad-based investment and a clear reduction in unemployment 
can be attained only if companies are able to stand up to 
increasingly intense international competition. 
  To achieve that aim requires: a reduction in the burdens of 
taxes and other levies on European companies, which are very 
high by international standards; more flexibility in labour 
markets, deregulation and privatisation of many important areas, 
such as telecommunications, energy, and transport; improvements 
in infrastructure, making use of private as well as public 
sector capital; and promotion of innovation by means of 
well-coordinated and application-orientated research and 
development policies. 
  From the point of view of German industry, the German 
presidency of the EU should aim to press forward speedily and 
consistently with the aim of completing the single market 
programme. 
  Of the measures putting the programme in place, 95 per cent 
have now been agreed. However, across the EU, only 87 per cent 
of the measures have been placed on the statute book so the 
single market cannot yet said to be fully operational. 
  Moreover, only 50 per cent of the measures have come into 
effect in all 12 member states. Partnership and co-operation 
are necessary to ensure that single market rules are applied in 
an efficient and even-handed manner. That is the only way to 
overcome competitive distortions. 
  Consolidating the single market also requires harmonisation 
of tax policies and reduction of fiscal hindrances. Action is 
called for to end burdens on industry stemming from provisional 
VAT [value-added tax] rules. This would require a decision on a 
new system for country-of-origin VAT collection. 
  Fiscal barriers for cross-border capital transactions and 
corporate restructuring must also be removed. A 
well-functioning joint export control regime is also needed 
encompassing so-called dual use goods i.e. those capable of both 
military and civilian applications. 
  Another priority is cross-border environmental protection. 
Common policies are required to control and to prevent 
environmental problems, particularly with regard to waste 
disposal but also with recycling and with the re-use of 
materials. 
  There is further need for action in the European Union's 
external relations, of utmost importance for assuring 
competitiveness. There may well be important landmarks here in 
the application of the GATT Uruguay Round agreement, as well as 
in the establishment of the World Trade Organisation. The EU 
needs to assume a leadership role in this respect alongside the 
United States. 
  The Union's trade policy must be strongly geared to the 
principles of multilateralism and openness towards the rest of 
the world. The leading industrialised countries' trade policy 
will be credible only if they refuse to countenance one-sided, 
discriminatory measures or threats of sanctions. 
  A decisive point for Europe's external relations will be the 
extension of trade and industrial co-operation with the reform- 
minded states of central and eastern Europe. The German EU 
presidency should devote special energy to supporting these 
countries' economic reform efforts. 
  In line with the principle of "self-help," trade and 
economic 
co-operation can provide the right conditions to allow these 
countries themselves to generate the revenues needed to finance 
these reforms. 
  Another central issue for the German presidency will be 
preparing the conference to review the Maastricht Treaty in 
1996. Here I anticipate improvements on the details of the 
treaty as well as decisive steps towards developing European 
integration. In particular, we must meet the challenges 
associated with enlargement towards some of the EFTA [European 
Free Trade Association] states and further economic and 
political rapprochement with Central and East Europe. 
  It is important to extend the European parliament's 
co-decision rights. Such reinforcement forms an essential part 
of efforts to strengthen the EU's democratic structures and to 
increase further the parliament's involvement in the European 
integration process.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Biondi Advances Anti-Corruption </F>
Proposals"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) La Valletta, June 14 -- Italian Justice 
Minister Alfredo Biondi today proposed to his colleagues in the 
Council of Europe that a multi-disciplinary work shop be set up 
which tackles all the various aspects of corruption as well as 
its penal, civil and administrative ramifications. 
  Reference to Biondi's proposals was also made by the Council 
of Europe's ad interim secretary general, Peter Leuprecht, who 
in his opening address called on the organization's 32 members 
to collaborate more closely to both prevent and repress 
corruption "a phenomenon from which no European country is 
saved." 
  Biondi went on to argue how it would be "extremely 
opportune" 
that the workings of this group be also open, either as members 
or observers, to other international organizations or countries 
which are not members of the Council of Europe, so they can 
contribute their different experiences. 
  He also recalled how the theme of the conference here, on 
the 
various aspects and levels of corruption, as well as the role of 
the judiciary, was based on an initiative from the Italian 
Justice Ministry "born from the conviction that this argument 
cannot be an exclusive monopoly of one nation." 
  "But the search for individual responsibilities for judicial 
ends" Biondi stressed, "must in no way push into second place 
the need to respect the basic rights of the individual, 
guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights." 
  The problem of repressing corruption must be on the same 
level as efficiently preventing corruption, the Italian minister 
continued, "We must introduce into our legal systems all the 
judicial measures needed to prevent, as much as possible, the 
creation of `at risk' situations, in which corruption can 
germinate and blossom." 
  The conference here is slated to conclude tomorrow with the 
adoption of a number of resolutions and sees the participation 
of the justice ministers from almost all 32 of the Council of 
Europe members as well as observers from Russia, the United 
States and the Holy See.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Improves Record on Adopting </F>
European Union Laws"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, June 6 -- Italy has greatly 
improved its record of adopting European Union [EU] laws and 
regulations and, with an adoption rate of 89.9 percent, now 
ranks fourth among the Member States for turning European Union 
into national law, according to the executive European 
Commissioner for the Single Market, Italy's Raniero Vanni 
d'Archirafi. 
  Denmark ranked first for adopting European Union law for 
having made its own 96 percent of European legislature, followed 
by Portugal with a 91 percent rate, the Netherlands at 90 
percent and then Italy. 
  Observers pointed out how Denmark and Portugal, with 
sixth-ranked Britain, were considered the greatest 
"Euro-skeptics," while Germany, viewed as the locomotive for 
European integration was third to last in adopting European 
Union laws, at a rate of 83 percent, while France stood at 87 
percent, fourth-to-last. 
  In an address to ministers responsible for European affairs, 
for Italy Domenico Comino, Vanni d'Archirafi announced how the 
European Commission had decided to "go on the warpath" to speed 
up the transformation of European Union law into national law. 
The EU executive, he said, was considering adopting, from now 
on, penalties and sanctions for the delays, as provided for in 
the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.

<F P=106> [Report by David Gardner: "Strasbourg Set To Tilt to the </F>
Left"] 
  [Text] In spite of strong gains for the right across the 
Continent, the balance of power in the European Parliament has 
changed little. If anything, in the consolidation of power 
rather than in absolute number of seats, the Strasbourg assembly 
will tilt slightly towards the left. 
  The hitherto dominant Socialist group will have in the new 
567-member legislature proportionally much the same presence as 
in the outgoing 518-strong assembly. This assumes that the Left 
Radical list in France headed by Mr Bernard Tapie either sits or 
allies with the Socialists. 
  Centre-right and right-wing parties are numerically 
strengthened. But the right will be a highly fragmented force, 
with fault-lines subject to continual political stress facing a 
much more cohesive Socialist bloc. 
  As a result, the broadly bipartisan motor put together by 
the 
Socialists and Christian Democrats in the last parliament may be 
much harder to crank up. That could stall the parliament in the 
way it uses its growing powers. 
  "Negotiations (between the two blocs) this time are going to 
be that much more complex, because of this new situation on the 
centre-right," predicts Mr Julian Priestley, secretary-general 
of the Socialist group, tipped to take over as secretary-general 
of the parliament. 
  Strasbourg was invested with significant new "powers by the 
Maastricht Treaty," enabling it to negotiate for the first time 
as a near equal with the Council of Ministers. 
  Since Maastricht came into force last November, Strasbourg 
has begun demonstrating that for the first time it has a sense 
of priorities, and can apply its weight effectively for example, 
in winning pledges for a top-table seat for the 1996 Maastricht 
review. 
  The new parliament will have to struggle to maintain that 
momentum, at a time when the Council's cohesion will probably be 
strengthened. Germany, France and Spain will successively hold 
the EU's [European Union] six-month rotating presidency up to 
1996, and are co-ordinating efforts to run as seamless a 
management as possible. The seams on parliament's centre-right, 
by contrast, are highly visible. 
  The traditional Christian Democrats, mostly from the six 
founding member states, have been strengthened by Chancellor 
Kohl's victory, but have shrunk to a core group of around 130 
MEPs [members of European Parliament]. This section could grow 
in strength if alliances with other groups, including Britain's 
Tories and Forza Italia, are concluded. 
  But even if such coalescence took place, the federalist 
European People's party (EPP) would then contain within it a 
powerful Euro-sceptical force. The Christian Democrats share 
with the Socialists a commitment to Europe's social and welfare 
policies. A strengthening of Euroscepticism would contrast with 
the Christian Democrats' track record as assiduous drafters of 
proto-constitutions for a federal Union. 
  As debate on the EU's jobless crisis sharpens and calls grow 
for labour market deregulation, and as the 1996 review 
approaches, the EPP could find it hard to stay together as a 
broad church. 
  The earliest set-pieces defining the new balance of power, 
however, will be in the carve-up of the main parliament jobs. 
  The presidency, until now a role hovering ineffectually 
between figurehead and parliamentary speaker, will assume 
greater importance. 
  The Socialists say they will almost certainly put forward a 
candidate. But first they must sort out their own leadership, 
up to now the most influential position at Strasbourg. 
  Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the UK Labour MEPs, now by far 
the largest national grouping in the assembly, is clear 
front-runner, in competition with the German SPD leader Klaus 
Hansch. If Mr Hansch does not win, he has a plausible claim to 
his group's backing for the presidency, as does Mr Jean-Pierre 
Cot, outgoing Socialist group chief. 
  One other presidential candidate, Ms Elisabeth Guigou, 
European affairs minister in the last French Socialist 
government, is an outside runner because of lack of MEP 
experience. Ms Guigou is also likely to suffer from the poor 
showing of France's Socialist list. 
  The fragmentation of the French vote would make it difficult 
for any group to sustain a French candidacy for the top job. 
Hopes that French centrist Dominique Baudis, the mayor of 
Toulouse, might get the presidency appear to have evaporated 
since his UDF-RPR [Union for French Democracy-Rally for the 
Republic] list lost ground. 
  Either of the two former Belgian Christian Democrat premiers 
elected, current EPP leader Leo Tindemans and Mr Wilfried 
Martens, could stand. However, many on both sides of the house 
feel parliament should look to the future rather than the past. 
  Once the presidency is settled, an unseemly scrap could take 
place for control of the four most important committees: foreign 
affairs (probably absorbing trade); budgets; environment; and 
economic and monetary affairs. The Socialists currently hold 
the firs three and the Christian Democrats the last. 
  The growing influence of the committees in shaping and 
shepherding legislation had won them cross-party support 
irrespective of which group chaired them. But this bipartisan 
attitude could now be eroded. 
  Mr Ken Collins, the Scottish Labour MEP who heads the 
environment committee -- arguably Strasbourg's single most 
influential body -- wants to keep it. He could face challenge 
not only from the right but from Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, former 
EU environment commissioner elected for Italy's Greens, and, 
according to insistent rumour, from Mrs Glenys Kinnock, wife of 
the former UK Labour leader, and now newly elected in Wales. 
  Competition for the chair of the foreign affairs/trade 
committee will be even fiercer if the two are amalgamated. 
Currently occupied by Mr Enrique Baron -- former president of 
the parliament tipped as new head of the WEU [Western European 
Union], the Union's embryonic defence arm -- the foreign affairs 
job conceivably could go to Mr Fernando Moran, respected former 
Socialist foreign minister. But the Spanish Socialists hold few 
cards after their hammering by both right and left on Sunday. 
  Mr Piet Dankert, Dutch European Affairs minister and a 
distinguished former parliamEnt president, has his eye on the 
budgets committee. But this could be a prime target for the 
EPP, which because of its fragmentation is having difficulty 
settling on candidates. 
  One other important decision will be the parliament's choice 
of the MEP to elaborate its case for the 1996 review conference. 
On merit and experience, this job might go to Scottish Labour 
MEP David Martin, whose constitutional work prior to the 
Maastricht summit was widely respected and influential. 
  In the new, more fissiparous configuration at Strasbourg, 
however, the premium on consensus could give way to a more 
partisan struggle, for both spoils and control.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of speech by Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth </F>
Clarke at Mansion House in London on 15 Jun] 
  [Text] This time last year, there were widespread doubts 
about the sustainability of the recovery. The forecasts then 
were for growth of just over 1 per cent and inflation of about 4 
per cent at the end of 1993. That was not the worst that 
forecasters have ever achieved. To be fair, they got the 
nominal growth of output right, but the inflation-output split 
wrong. But it has reinforced the intention I already had, to 
treat forecasts with considerable caution and not to become too 
mesmerised by them. 
  We have actually seen in the past 12 months a strong 
recovery, with a better split between real growth and inflation 
and an earlier fall in unemployment than would have been 
expected, based on British experiences in earlier recessions. 
  I do realise there are still concerns in some quarters that 
we in Britain will throw away all these hard-fought gains again 
and that yet another recovery will not be sustained. I can 
assure you that as far as the Government is concerned, we will 
do no such thing. We have not created the conditions for the 
strongest recovery in Europe in order to throw it away by 
creating yet another boom followed by a bust. 
  I believe our economy is now strong enough to sustain the 
growth rates that everyone knows I would like to see. But the 
concerns are only too understandable, given our economic history 
since the war. I believe that we can avoid these problems of the 
past. 
  Tonight I would like to explain why I am confident history 
will not repeat itself and why I see the prospect of recovery 
being sustained. 
  The threats are all too clear. In my opinion, three major 
problems have derailed recoveries in the past: unsustainable 
public borrowing, which eventually required a sharp tightening 
of fiscal policy, a failure to keep inflation under control and 
prevent recovery turning into boom, with much the same result; 
problems on the supply side, reflected in bottlenecks, shortages 
of capacity and skilled labour, and burgeoning current account 
deficits. 
  If I am right and if history need not repeat itself, we have 
to face and to avoid all these risks in the present upturn. 
  First, public finance. The public finances were put on a 
sustainable footing in the 1993 budgets. The issue now is to 
stick to that prospectus and, above all, to maintain tight 
control of public expenditure. I set out the limits for the 
"new control totals" in my Budget. Those totals are ceilings, 
and my medium-term aim is to see general Government expenditure 
falling below 40 per cent of GDP once again. 
  The new control total approach allows us to keep much better 
control of public expenditure than we used to as the economy 
recovers. Low expenditure is the key to lower taxes. We will 
cut taxes again, but only when we can afford to do so and not 
before. The public are usually more sensible than politicians or 
the press. They will not put their confidence in a government 
that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control. 
  I am also determined that my second spectre of inflation 
does 
not return to haunt us. Three times in our recent history a 
burst in inflation has destroyed a recovery and taken us back to 
deep recession. The effects of inflation are insidious and 
affect us all. We should not lose sight of them. 
  Inflation breeds uncertainty. And uncertainty distorts 
business decisions, discourages investment and unsettles savers. 
That means a less efficient economy, less investment and less 
prosperity. Inflation is a silent thief that robs the elderly 
and cheats the saver. Low inflation is not an optional extra. 
It is the necessary condition for the steady and sustained 
growth that I want to see in the 1990s and beyond. 
  I often hear, sometimes from people in the City, the fear 
that politicians might still secretly hanker after a little 
inflation. After all, a little inflation leads to higher 
interest rates for savers, higher wages for workers and higher 
house prices for home- owners. What a temptation to ministers 
who need a "feel good" factor to go with the recovery. Speaking 
as a politician, I say that would be very bad politics. 
  A little more inflation is simply not an option for this 
Government. A little more inflation will not make savers, 
workers or home-owners feel good for long. A fraudulent 
inflationary "feel good" would soon turn to "feel very bad" as 
the bust followed the boom. As I have already said, our 
masters, the public, are usually more sensible than their 
politicians or the press. They feel good when they have 
recovery that is going to last, with low inflation. 
  I shall continue to set monetary policy to keep underlying 
inflation within the 1-4 per cent range, and to reduce it to the 
lower half of that band by the end of the present Parliament. 
  I decided that my prospects of success in achieving that 
target could only be enhanced by a properly informed, open 
debate about the causes of inflation, and the policy measures 
required to control it. In my opinion, the most important 
decision I have made in monetary policy so far has not been 
either of my interest-rate moves, but the decision to publish 
the minutes of my monthly meetings with Eddie George, the Bank 
Governor. You will see it every month, with only a short lag to 
allow the Bank time to carry out any operations I decide on. 
  On top of the Bank's quarterly inflation report, and the 
point- by-point explanations of interest-rate changes that we 
have also introduced in the past couple of years, that will add 
to the credibility of our monetary policy. I have deliberately 
created a system of decision-taking about interest rates in this 
country that is one of the most open and transparent in the 
world. I have given todays politicians and tomorrows 
politicians no choice but to pursue the path of low inflation to 
which we are so clearly publicly committed. 
  My Lord Mayor, long-term bond yields have been rising all 
around the world this year, but they have risen by more in the 
UK than in most countries. But, the markets seem to be 
schizophrenic. They appear to believe I am going to put up 
interest rates, but they also believe that inflation will rise 
out of its target range regardless. 
  The traders and investors who are demanding these high 
yields 
seem to be paying no attention to the analysts in the next 
office, most of whom are forecasting inflation to stay on 
target. I think it is the analysts who are right. And I am 
determined to prove that to the traders, and to others such as 
wage bargainers whose suspicions of higher inflation might 
themselves add to inflationary pressures. 
  I do not pretend that the increase in credibility will 
happen 
instantly. It will require proof that I can justify any 
decision I make on objective economic grounds alone. But the 
changes I have made to the conduct of monetary policy will help 
to ensure that nobody will be able to sell out our strong 
anti-inflation strategy. 
  But though low inflation and sound public finances are 
necessary, they are not sufficient conditions to achieve what we 
really want to see. My aim is a long period of healthy, 
balanced growth, which creates jobs and sees gradually higher 
living standards for all. Our ability to sustain satisfactory 
growth rates will depend on supply-side considerations. We have 
to ensure that increases in demand are translated into more 
growth, not more inflation. That means tackling our third 
historic failure and eliminating the skills shortages and 
bottlenecks that have blocked progress in the past. 
  It Is now a commonplace that the world is becoming an ever 
more competitive place. Given the pace of change in technology 
and business organisation, none of us can predict, with any 
confidence, the new industries of the future, nor where the new 
jobs will come from, nor what skills will be required to fill 
them. The most successful economies will be those that respond 
quickest and most wholeheartedly to new markets and new 
competition. Within economies, the most competitive companies, 
and the most successful individuals, will be the most flexible 
and adaptable. I believe this recovery will last because we are 
adding to the measures that created a modern dynamic economy in 
the 1980s, and are creating an ever more adaptable, better, real 
economy for the 1990s. 
  My Lord Mayor, this Government believes in the need for 
ongoing improvements to the supply side of the economy. This is 
why we place so much importance on the recent White Paper on 
competitiveness. One area that I believe is particularly 
important to the future strength of our economy is education and 
training. The UK entered this recovery with a workforce that is 
being far better educated than in the recent past. 
  Thanks to the supply-side reforms, Britain is also well 
placed to see growth this time balanced between consumer demand, 
investment, and exports. 
  There has already been strong growth in consumer demand and 
retail sales are at record levels. But there are now an 
increasing number of signs that this pick-up in consumer 
spending is being supported by exports and investment. Export 
growth is proving resilient to recession in continental Europe. 
And exports to non-EC countries are on a firm upward trend. 
  Investment activity has also picked up, with the modest 
recovery seen in the second half of last year being sustained 
this year. Forward-looking surveys show that this upturn in 
investment looks set to continue. 
  But the volume of investment is not of itself the key 
indicator. Structural policy must aim to create the conditions 
for profitable investment, and I would like to see the 
improvements in capital productivity seen in the 1980s built 
upon in the 1990s. More effective use of capital and labour 
will help us unplug the blockages that have resulted in high 
inflation and balance of payments problems, and ultimately 
derailed the economic recovery. 
  My Lord Mayor, in some ways, the most heartening feature of 
this year is that businesses have recovered their 
self-confidence. The ingredients and policies are in place for 
lasting success. That lasting success means our firms 
outcompeting and outfighting those of our friends and trading 
partners in Europe and elsewhere.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have emphasized the 
common ground in the policy of the two governments. Berlusconi, 
who arrived in Bonn on Thursday [16 June] on his first visit 
abroad since he became head of a government of a right-wing 
alliance, mainly pointed to the successes of his party, Forza 
Italia, and of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in the 
European election. 
  Kohl welcomed his guest with military honors in front of the 
Chancellor's Office, before withdrawing with Berlusconi for 
lunch and political talks. In his welcome address, Kohl mainly 
underlined the joint positions in European policy. He pointed 
out that the founding treaties of what was then called the 
European Economic Community were signed as "Rome Treaties" in 
the Italian capital in 1958. After the collapse of nationalism 
and fascism in Europe, Italy and the FRG established stable 
democracies, the chancellor said, adding that Italy's commitment 
to Europe has always been exemplary. 
  Italy and Germany always pursued the same course in Europe, 
"and we will continue to pursue the same course for Europe in 
the future, too," Kohl said. Berlusconi took over 
responsibility as Italian government head in an era of dramatic 
changes. "For this I wish you all the best, and may God be with 
you," Kohl said. 
  In his reply, Berlusconi told the unusually large number of 
journalists that, after the European election, it was a 
particular pleasure for him to be in Bonn "since the political 
forces that we represent" have done so well in these elections. 
The Italian government head, who is facing international 
criticism due to the participation of the neofascist National 
Alliance in his cabinet, referred to the joint heritage in the 
Christian tradition, which united him with Kohl. The work of 
his government will focus on the struggle for peace, against 
antisemitism, and for tolerance. 
  Berlusconi said he was very proud that Russia would 
participate in the summit of leading economic nations that he 
would host in Naples in early July. He called for a European 
task force, which should take military action whenever 
humanitarian principles were violated. There was no room for 
questions after the short statements by Kohl and Berlusconi. 
  Berlusconi's short visit to Bonn had caused some protest, 
mainly on the part of the opposition. The Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] and Greens had called on Kohl to distance 
himself from Berlusconi's neofascist coalition partner. In 
interviews in German media, the Italian prime minister and 
wealthy media tycoon defended the cooperation of the National 
Alliance in his cabinet. 
  Michel Friedman (CDU), member of the Presidium of the 
Central 
Council of Jews in Germany, on Saarland Radio called on the 
Federal Government to keep its distance from the Berlusconi-led 
government. In an interview with BILD, the prime minister 
resolutely rejected the accusation that members of his 
government alliance were fascists. "There are no neofascists in 
my government," he said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- During the first visit to Bonn on 
Thursday [16 June] by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl should clearly distance himself 
from Berlusconi's fascist coalition partners. This was 
requested by the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and 
Greens on Wednesday. 
  During his one-day visit to Bonn, Berlusconi will discuss 
bilateral relations. Other subjects on the agenda are the 
upcoming economic summit in Naples and Germany's European Union 
presidency. The visit will be Berlusconi's first trip abroad as 
head of government. 
  "The presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian 
Government is a disgrace for Italy and a danger to peace in 
Europe," Deputy SPD Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul said. 
The Federal Government must rule out any official contacts with 
them. 
  In the view of the Greens, Kohl will make himself an 
"accomplice of the European right-wing extremists" by receiving 
Berlusconi in Bonn. This would upgrade the profascist 
government internationally, Ludger Vollmer, head of the Alliance 
90/Greens, criticized. 
  The SPD and Greens have once more called on the chancellor 
and CDU chairman to prevent the acceptance of Berlusconi's 
party, "Forza Italia," into the Christian Democratic group in 
the European Parliament. 
  Meanwhile, the Bundestag Presidium has rejected a request by 
the Alliance 90/Greens to ask the Federal Government to 
elucidate in the Bundestag its position on the participation of 
the fascists in the Italian Government. The government was the 
result of the sovereign will of the Italian voters and has to be 
"neither commented on nor criticized" by the Federal Government, 
said Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
stressed Germany's vital interest in further reforms in Russia. 
On Thursday [16 June] during a meeting with Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the Russian State Duma, the chancellor paid tribute 
to his balancing role in Russian politics. According to 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, both agreed that the 
relations between Bonn and Moscow are free from basic and 
unsolvable problems. 
  At the beginning of his four-day visit to Germany, Rybkin, 
who is close to the communist agriculture party in the State 
Duma, also met with President Richard von Weizsaecker and 
Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth. In addition, talks with 
Cabinet members and the chairmen of the Bundestag groups were 
scheduled. Rybkin wants to visit Cologne and Berlin over the

  [Text] Munich -- The election of Michael Bashford as the 
new federal chairman of the Instead Party was declared void by 
the Augsburg Land Court on Thursday [16 June]. The eighth 
chamber of the court says in its ruling that there were grave 
procedural mistakes in the 4 June election by the federal 
convention. This decision sustained the claim by Munich law 
professor Bernd Schuenemann, the previous chairman. 
  Under the threat of an administrative fine of up to 500,000 
German marks, Bashford and party founder Markus Wegner were 
forbidden to claim that Schuenemann was voted down by the 
federal convention. The claim that Bashford is the new federal 
chairman must not be made or spread either. 
  At the meeting in Hamburg, Bashford had won a majority. The 
court's ruling states that some of the land organizations had 
not been invited. Although the Hamburg Land Court had ruled 
prior to the convention that the North Rhine-Westphalian land 
organization must be invited, the North Rhine-Westphalian 
delegates had not had the right to vote, speak, or submit a 
motion. This is a clear violation of the delegates' rights, the 
ruling says.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Dini on Court Ruling on Pensions, </F>
Spending"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Washington, June 12 -- Saturday's [11 June] 
ruling by Italy's constitutional court restoring pension 
minimums to as many as 600,000 retired persons for an estimated 
cost to the social security system of up to 16 trillion lire is 
"bad news" for the Treasury, said Minister Lamberto Dini. 
  The top treasury official spoke in an interview with ANSA 
during a visit here to meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen and Director General of the International Monetary Fund 
Michel Camdessus. 
  Dini called the decision "a potential element worsening the 
public accounts balance that the government will have to take 
note of during the preparation of the 1995 budget." 
  The Treasury Minister did not rule out the need for new 
budget adjustments soon to counteract the spending increase that 
ruling will entail. 
  Dini said his U.S. and IMF interlocutors, with whom he 
talked 
about topics that will be discussed during the July Group of 
Seven summit in Naples, had shown great interest in the 1995 
budget, "from which they expect to be able to evaluate the 
economic policy and strategy of the government."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Treasury Minister on Privatizations </F>
at Lower House"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 14 -- The government intends to 
move quickly on privatizations and the sale of share packages of 
STET [Tutin Telephone Finance Company], the IRI-controlled 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] telecommunications 
financial holding company, ENEL [National Electric Power Board], 
and the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] energy divisions 
"will depend, in the first place, on the fulfillment of the 
preparatory norms on privatization," said Treasury Minister 
Lamberto Dini. 
  In a question and answer session at the Lower House today, 
Dini disclosed that before the summer is out, the government 
will lay down the guidelines for the formation of privatization 
authorities in the services sector, one authority for each 
sector. Before this, however, the government must complete an 
"act of concession" for ENEL for the production and distribution 
of energy to prepare the board for privatization. 
  Responding to MPs worries about maintaining a public role in 
STET and ENEL, the minister explained, "The contents of the 
privatization decree correspond precisely to this concern. In 
fact, a golden share will stay in the state's hands and, look at 
this carefully, while the limit on the size of a single holding 
will expire in three years, the golden share will never be less." 
  On the point of protection of the rights of small 
shareholders, the minister said the executive will follow 
through on the idea of "slate voting" for the boards of the 
newly-privatized companies whereby majority shareholders and 
small shareholders and their representatives will run majority 
and minority slates. 
  Asked about the fate of IRI, Dini said, in substance, that 
it 
was too early to say. The privatization and liquidation of IRI 
companies will, however, be pursued "with maximum speed" and 
will always be accompanied by "relevant management activities." 
  The minister, who began talking while seated at the 
government bench and was then told by the duty speaker to stand 
when addressing the chamber, as is customary, also dismissed 
allegations of a conflict of interest between Premier Silvio 
Berlusconi's government duties and his ownership of Fininvest, 
Italy's second-largest private business enterprise. 
  "I would like to reassure the Parliament on this point 
because the number of filters between the premier's coordination 
center and the one where decisions are made are such as to stop 
any intermingling of interests." He identified the "filters" as 
"the panel of three ministers, Treasury, Budget and Industry, 
the consulting and guarantee committee on privatizations, 
chaired by the Treasury director general, the companies' boards 
of directors and, in some cases, the directors of the holdings." 
He went on to report that "national interests will always be 
taken into account" in the privatization process and pointed out 
that thus far 63 percent of the shares sold off have wound up in 
Italy. 
  The new government also intends to fulfill the promise of 
the 
past executive: that revenues from privatizations "must be 
deposited in a fund for the retirement of state securities for 
the purpose of reducing the volume of the public debt in 
circulation." 
  After affirming that plans for the privatization of STET 
will 
go forward "without any further thinking," the minister 
responded to a proposal from the opposition Communist 
Refoundation for a halt to this plan to prepare for the merger 
of the telecom holding company, RAI, the public radio and 
television broadcaster, the news agency ANSA, Olivetti, the big 
computer manufacturer, and IRI's Finseil. "If ideas of industry 
synergies among the telephone, television and information media 
sectors should emerge, account could be taken of this during the 
privatization program," said the minister. 
  On the hot topic of social security funds, following a 
calculation yesterday that a Constitutional Court ruling will 
cost the state an additional 30 trillion lire (18.75 billion 
dollars), Dini said the government is committed to legislative 
changes, "especially in the fiscal area." 
  These changes, he explained, will be aimed at furthering the 
growth of "financial intermediaries as required for the creation 
and development of broadly-based shareholding companies and to 
curb and rationalize social security spending."

Privatizations"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 16 -- Italy's privatizations will 
take place with full respect for European Union [EU] competition 
rules, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino reassured the EU 
commissioner for Competition, Karel van Miert, at a meeting here 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  A ministry communique said the meeting took place in a 
"cordial climate" and also covered a wide range of issues 
concerning European anti-trust and competition regulations, 
focussing on the new Rome government's "orientations" for 
privatizations. 
  Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini also met Van Miert and 
discussed state aid to industry, privatizations, regional aid 
and tax rules for payments made by employers for pensions and 
welfare, a communique said. 
  Van Miert urged Rome to prepare as soon as possible a list 
of 
areas that may be eligible for EU funds. Most of the EU funds 
set aside for development and infrastructure projects in 
southern Italy over the past several years have not been used.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flap on Berlusconi's Dismay With </F>
`Opposition' RAI-TV"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Opposition parties called 
today for mass mobilization in protest against Premier Silvio 
Berlusconi's criticism of the failure of the public radio and 
television broadcaster, RAI, to reflect the views of the nation 
as embodied in his rightist government. 
  In further reaction, the chairman of the Lower House 
Constitutional Affairs Committee [Gustavo Selva] urged the 
resignation of RAI management and the naming of a special 
commissioner and a former Lower House speaker [Giorgio 
Napolitano] spoke against government tampering with the 
broadcaster as members of the RAI editorial staff demonstrated 
and Berlusconi talked to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro about 
the RAI case. 
  Against the backdrop of headlines reporting the opinions of 
the premier, whose Fininvest holds the commercial television 
monopoly, the Democratic Party of the Left, Communist Renewal 
and other opposition parties met to push for mobilization "in 
defense of the right to information and as an immediate reply to 
the premier's exceptional infringement in the issue of the radio 
and television system," said a communique issued by these 
leftist alignments. 
  Also today, the public broadcaster's editorial staff staged 
a 
demonstration in front of the Lower House building on what they 
called, D-Day, or "the longest day." Leaflets handed out by 
about 50 RAI journalists said, "As opposed to what happened in 
Normandy, where the invaders brought freedom, there is today the 
threat of a new `occupation,' of the public service." 
  "Berlusconi lets it be known that RAI must get into line, 
otherwise he'll take care of things personally in a few days. 
So were the other premiers who personally `handled' RAI right, 
in degrading it professionally and loading it with debt?," asked 
the flyer. 
  With the arrival of MPs, the demonstration turned into an 
open-air debate, with some of the "stars" of the airwaves on 
hand, and then into a "happening" when protesting miners whose 
jobs are threatened were called over to join the show. 
  Inside, Constitutional Affairs Committee Chairman Gustavo 
Selva, of the neofascist National Alliance, said the 
"professors" who head RAI should have tendered their 
resignations some time back. "If they don't, approaching is a 
solution proposed by me for the naming of a commissioner for 
RAI." 
  He also said a "save-RAI" bill, a supplementary funding 
package for the heavily indebted broadcaster, should be rejected 
by the Parliament because RAI should not be allowed to have 
three sources of income, advertising revenues, annual fees paid 
by the viewing public and public funds to level off debt. 
  Selva applauded Berlusconi's remarks, made yesterday, and 
declared: "It is evident that RAI programs are anti-government. 
This is an anomaly. In Germany, France, Britain, the public 
broadcaster does not allocate an opposition attitude to the 
government as does RAI. This is an anomaly to correct. But 
perhaps the RAI editorial staff should do this," added the 
committee chairman. 
  Taking the opposite view was Giorgio Napolitano, the former 
Lower House speaker, who wrote a letter to the speakers of the 
two new houses in which he argued, "It is admissible for the new 
ruling coalition to demand the resignation of the RAI board, 
named on the basis of a law approved by the Parliament. Laws 
cannot be torn up like this." 
  He went on say he thought it correct to submit his views to 
Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, of Berlusconi's Forza Italia, 
and Lower House Speaker Irene Pivetti, of Northern League 
government ally, because of their roles "above the sides and 
their scrupulous balance." If the present government upsets 
recovery and revision under way in RAI, argued Napolitano, the 
result would be only the application of a new spoils system 
which would "deal the public service a death blow." 
  In conclusion, the former speaker said, "RAI must be 
reformed, as provided for in the law passed by the Parliament in 
June, and reform must define the way for naming a future board 
after the present one completes its mandate. But RAI cannot be 
manipulated in violation of the law and the constitutional 
principles which safeguard it." [passage omitted] 
  The premier, talking later in the day about the turn-out of 
RAI journalists, said, "This reaction conceals the usual 
disinformation of certain communications mediums which, thinking 
only of maintaining the status quo at RAI, evidently cannot even 
stand to have the problem brought up." After disclosing that he 
and the head of state had discussed the RAI problem, "seeing 
that this is disinformation," Berlusconi said that many 
newspapers had totally turned around the meaning of what he had 
said. 
  "I think I expressed a very balanced opinion, perhaps banal, 
and that is that I hoped that the public service would stay 
independent, autonomous, balanced and that it would look to 
government activities with a free spirit, talking well of it or 
badly, according to the time and what the executive does," he 
said. 
  In the meantime, Berlusconi's Forza Italia said the clamour 
raised in the newspapers today only shows "once again the 
prejudicial position against this government taken by most of 
the press." This communique also urged, as regards RAI news, "a 
return to the objectivity, independence and pluralism which 
takes into account that the greater part of the voters have 
determined the formation of the coalition ruling the country."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Alto Adige's Self-Determination </F>
Urged"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Vienna, June 10 -- Italy's German-speakers in 
the Alto Adige region will demand their right to 
"self-determination" if fascism advances in the country, "even 
if in a new guise and with new methods," according to the leader 
of the Suedtiroler Volkspartei (SVP) Siegfried Brugger. 
  Brugger, whose party has been the middle-of-the-road 
political vehicle representing a majority of the Alto Adige's 
German speakers in the Rome parliament since World War II, told 
a dinner in his honour here yesterday evening that the people of 
the South Tyrol had already experienced "what fascism was on 
their own skin." 
  The South Tyrol question is one of the older ones in 
contemporary European history. The seeds were sown at the end 
of World War I when Italy was handed an almost entirely 
German-speaking area strongly linked to the Tyrol and Austria. 
Under fascist rule, radical Italianisation brought the 
replacement of German education and place names, and major 
industries were also created in Bolzano and its environs to 
encourage immigration there by Italians. 
  The fascist regime's forced Italianisation plan failed 
however and, in 1939, Hitler and Mussolini decided to solve the 
dispute with an iron fist. German-speaking inhabitants of the 
region were required to choose between being German and Italian. 
If they chose the former, they were forced to emigrate to the 
Third Reich, if the latter they lost their cultural identity. 
  The history of self-determination for Alto Adige-South Tyrol 
has been spattered with extremist violence, and bomb attacks 
began again in the early 1980's after a lull lasting from 1972, 
when a long-negotiated autonomy statute went into effect, until 
1979. 
  The most hotly disputed part of the package, mostly by the 
Italian speakers who rewarded the neofascist Italian Social 
Movement, now forming the bulk of the National Alliance, in 
terms of votes for its pro-Rome stance, is obligatory 
bilingualism and the division of public employment, social 
welfare contributions and housing on an ethnic basis. 
  As the Berlusconi government was being formed, Brugger 
warned 
that the "dangerousness of the neofascists" had been shown once 
more by their electoral and postelectoral demands for a revision 
of post-World War II treaties. 
  Now, saying that the Berlusconi government includes five 
ministers and 11 deputy ministers who are "neofascists," Brugger 
warned that Italy is going to the right. If new elections are 
held in the near future as some people are speculating, Brugger 
said the right would advance again and the Northern League's 
decline would continue. 
  Brugger also voiced concern over the concentration of the 
means of information in Berlusconi's hands and his apparent 
attempt, together with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini 
to get the public broadcasting corporation, RAI, under his 
control, too. 
  Last year, an SVP congress in Bolzano, or Bozen as the 
German 
speakers call it, reasserted the demand for self-determination. 
  In the run-up to the March 27-28 general elections, the SVP 
filed suit against Italy's new electoral law. The argument was 
that the 4-percent threshold set nationwide for access to seats 
in the proportional section of the ballot would automatically 
rule it out because of its support is only local. 
  The constitutional court rejected the case, but said the 
government would have to move to ensure that the evident 
disparity of treatment was corrected.

<F P=106> ["hjs." report: "Liberals Criticize Direct Research </F>
Incentives"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- FRG Research Minister Paul Krueger 
(Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) has warned against incorrect 
conclusions in research and technology politics because of the 
stimulation of economic activity in the FRG. In the long run, 
economic growth and new growth markets can only be created on 
the basis of new technologies. Now the right course has to be 
set for it. 
  On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Group, Research Policy Spokesman Josef Vosen stated that, with 
the understanding for research and technology policies expressed 
in the FRG research report, economic, social, and ecological 
challenges cannot be met. "The formerly flourishing research 
landscape in Germany is drying up" Vosen said, and referred to 
the research budget's share of the federal budget, which 
decreased from 2.7 percent in the mid-eighties to 1.9 percent 
now. 
  Vosen again criticized the above-average cuts in the 1994 
research budget of 250 million German marks. On behalf of the 
SPD, Vosen called for the reintroduction of a tax incentive for 
research and the examination of all legal norms, to discover 
whether and how many obstacles to research and development 
activities are contained therein. A massive increase in the 
research budget is necessary. 
  On behalf of the CDU Group, Research Policy Spokesman 
Christian Lenzer stressed that the recession has shown where 
structural and organizational problems are burdening research in 
Germany and where entrenchment and lack of communication have 
made research heavy-handed. This should be understood as a 
"positive lesson" and the proper conclusions should be drawn. 
Proposals for an improvement by the CDU/Christian Social Union 
[CSU] Bundestag Group were already submitted a long time ago. 
Now speedy action, not regret, is required, he said. 
  On behalf of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], 
Deputy Juergen Timm stated that the situation is becoming 
dangerous for the FDP because the CDU/CSU and the SPD have 
basically the same research policy ideas. Politicians and 
officials in ministries overestimate their capacities if they 
pretend to know which fields of research are promising, which 
enterprises are competitive, or which markets exist for which 
products. The FDP neither believes in the functioning of an 
industrial policy, whatever it may be like, nor in the special 
advantages of direct research incentives, as compared to 
large-scale indirect incentive measures.

<F P=106> [Report by Rainer Nahrendorf: "The Free Democratic Party </F>
Wants the Solidarity Surcharge To Phase Out as Soon as Possible"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 15 Jun -- According to Economics Minister 
Guenter Rexrodt, the upswing should not lead anyone to postpone 
a solution to structural problems, which in the minister's view 
include high labor cost, high tax burdens, and the inflexible 
labor market. 
  Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt considers it possible 
that 
economic growth in all of Germany will be more than 1.5 
percentage points in 1994. He does not know by how many tenths 
percentage points higher economic growth might be, but it could 
be about 2 percent, he said in a HANDELSBLATT interview. 
  The upswing in the new federal laender is under way, and the 
flourishing landscapes are coming. Rexrodt is soon expecting a 
self-supporting recovery process. 
  Rexrodt considers it very likely that the price increase 
rate 
in 1994 will be less than 3 percent on an annual average. The 
minister also sees a good chance that the price increase rate 
will develop in the direction of 2 percent in 1995 -- however, 
with a GDP growth of at least 2.5 percent, it is likely to be 3 
percent. 
  The cyclical tail wind should by no means lead anyone to 
relax efforts to solve the structural problems of the German 
economy or even postpone a solution. The 1994 pay negotiations, 
which involved the renunciation of pay increases, have generally 
gone well, according to Rexrodt. The wage and salary 
settlements were in accordance with the situation. What was 
even more important, however, was the fact that the beginning of 
the flexibilization of working hours had been successful. 
Rexrodt said that a return to full employment required the 
comprehensive flexibilization of the labor market. 
  Commenting on collective pay negotiations in 1995, 1996, and 
1997, Rexrodt said that if economic development improved, it 
would not be economically possible or defensible for real 
incomes to decrease further. However, Rexrodt also assumes that 
the trade unions are aware of the changes in international 
competition. He hopes the trade unions have realized that there 
is no scope for redistribution, and the development of wages in 
the next few years must be strictly oriented at productivity. 
"If we deviate from the productivity-oriented course just 
because the cycle has improved a bit, Germany will miss the 
opportunity to improve the competitiveness of its economic 
sector." 
  To create more flexibility on the labor market, changes 
would 
have to be made in the pay agreements and legal framework 
conditions. An important element was the abolition of the 
Federal Employment Office's monopoly regarding finding 
employment. In addition, more flexibility should be introduced 
without extending standard working hours. Under certain 
conditions, it should also be possible to work on weekends. 
Compensation periods for average weekly working hours should be 
expanded. Over the long term, annual working hours would be 
required. This was the best way to balance seasonal 
fluctuations. Rexrodt also advocated abolishing the declaration 
of general application of collective agreements, and orienting 
collective agreements to a larger degree at the development of 
sectors, regions, and companies. He also called for revision 
clauses in collective agreements to allow companies to take a 
deterioration or improvement of the situation into account. 
<H5>  Taxes </H5>
  Rexrodt said the taxes and surcharges in Germany were too 
high and in some areas even prohibitively high. The Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] intended to reduce the tax burden. The 
liberals wanted the solidarity surcharge to be abolished as soon 
as possible. Rexrodt went beyond the decision on the solidarity 
surcharge that the FDP made at its party congress in Rostock. 
As economics minister, he would like to achieve agreement on 
the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge. In this context, a 
step-by-step reduction could be agreed upon. Such timeframe 
would be the right economic and political signal. The citizens 
would then believe the coalition that it considered the 
solidarity surcharge a special burden caused by the former GDR's 
old debt, and no new tax that was secretly imposed for an 
indefinite period of time. 
  In addition, such an agreement on the timeframe could 
produce 
a useful effect on the consolidation of public budgets, even 
though he recognized that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel 
was seriously working at the consolidation. Rexrodt admitted, 
however, that it was currently impossible to agree with the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] on 
the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge. 
  Reducing and finally abolishing the solidarity surcharge 
was also necessary to lower the whole tax rate, said Rexrodt. 
He said 1997 was a realistic and timely perspective for the 
abolition of the solidarity surcharge and a linear reduction of 
the whole tax rate. The leeway that would be created in the 
1996 and 1997 budgets should not be used to give in to new 
demands. 
  Rexrodt advocated the abolition of the trade capital tax and 
a 50-percent reduction of the trade income tax as well as 
abolition of the company capital tax. 
  If the Federal Constitutional Court were to declare the 
standard values unconstitutional, too high taxes on commercial 
or private real estate property should be prevented. Real 
estate investment should continue to be worthwhile. 
  Rexrodt said the reduction of the tax rate for business 
incomes, which was introduced with the law on safeguarding 
Germany as an investment center, should be extended to all 
incomes. The wage and income tax rate should be reduced. The 
FDP demands in its election platform that the high income tax 
rate be reduced to less than 45 percent over the medium and long 
term. 
  If the trade tax was abolished or reduced, the splitting 
system for private and business incomes would no longer be 
necessary, said Rexrodt. 
  The economics minister believes that the introduction of tax 
allowances for risk capital according to the example of Section 
16 of the former law promoting the Berlin economy should be 
considered. Under that law, funds that were made available for 
investment in Berlin were deductible. 
  However, Rexrodt also rejected new subsidies or tax 
allowances for medium-sized companies. Lower tax rates would be 
much more helpful for such companies, he said. Therefore, they 
should be introduced as soon as possible. Announcing subsidies 
and allowances would only cause investors to adopt a 
wait-and-see attitude, and was always connected with a steering 
of investment. Rexrodt: "The taxes must be reduced. This is 
the best way to promote medium-sized companies." 
  Rexrodt warned about changing the inheritance tax and the 
property tax. He said this would only deprive people of the 
success of their work. It would not serve investment and would 
frustrate people. 
<H5>  Ecology </H5>
  According to Rexrodt, ecological taxes can only be 
introduced 
in the European context. In addition, the introduction of an 
ecological component into the tax system would have to be 
connected with a net tax relief for companies and citizens. 
Only if these conditions were met, could ecological elements be 
introduced into the tax system to reduce energy consumption and 
the emission of pollutants. 
  He said the FDP advocated introducing market economy 
elements 
into ecological policy. A carbon dioxide tax would be such an 
element. Basically, this tax would reward those who helped the 
environment, and punish those who excessively burdened the 
environment. This would be a good and consistent approach. 
Rexrodt doubts, however, that an energy/carbon dioxide tax can 
be introduced in Europe by 2000 under the stated conditions. He 
said German politicians were working on this project. 
  In Rexrodt's view, the transition from car tax to petroleum 
tax should be linked to the introduction of a carbon 
dioxide/energy tax. It should not be touched prior to the 
introduction of that tax. Private and professional drivers are 
facing enough burdens already. With a view to the unavoidable 
energy tax, no more experiments should be made with the 
petroleum tax. 
<H5>  Consolidation </H5>
  Rexrodt said that the thorny path of general consolidation 
in 
public finances must be continued. This includes economizing in 
all fields of expenditure, including traditional subsidies. 
This Sisyphean task must be undertaken on drawing up each new 
budget. The coal subsidies will have to be further reduced in 
the medium term. However, this will not be possible until after 
the year 2000, when reductions set in. Shipping and shipyards 
in Europe also urgently require a general cut in subsidies. 
Anyone touching agricultural subsidies must be aware of the 
fact that this means attacking one of the pillars of a common 
Europe. Economically speaking, cuts in agricultural subsidies 
may be urgently necessary, but one should apply caution due to 
European aspects, Rexrodt said. The thorough screening of the 
entire budget does, of course, also include social items. 
  Each new subsidy must be limited in time and as degressive 
as 
possible. This also goes for subsidies in the new laender. 
Rexrodt admitted, however, that this principle could hardly be 
sustained in agriculture. 
<H5>  Postal Reform II </H5>
  Rexrodt fiercely criticized the behavior of the German 
Postal 
Trade Union in applying the social wage agreement under phase II 
of the postal reform. What he finds hard to understand is not 
only the behavior of the trade union, but also the resonance 
that the union has with the Social Democrats. In view of the 
German telecommunication industry's competitiveness, the postal 
union's behavior is irresponsible in the medium and long term. 
This behavior endangers jobs in one of the few growth sectors. 
Rexrodt fears that other postal companies will take over most 
of the business if the German post enterprises cannot operate at 
the same conditions as other private enterprises.

<F P=106> [Interview with Otmar Issing, member of the Bundesbank Board </F>
of Directors and professor of economics, by Sabine Richter; 
place and date not given: "Interest Rates Have Reached a 
Reasonable Level"] 
  [Text] [Richter] After many small steps, the Bundesbank 
has now decided on a surprisingly significant step with respect 
to interest rates. Does this mean that the bank is conducting 
economic policy? 
  [Issing] Monetary measures can, of course, influence the 
economic situation. However, we are not directly responsible 
for it. It is well-known that we have a medium-term concept and 
have enough liquidity in relation to the current economic 
situation. That is why there is no need for monetary policy to 
be used to stimulate the economy. 
  [Richter] However, the economy and stock markets in Germany 
and Europe could use a small boost from the interest rates. 
Will the interest rates continue to fall? 
  [Issing] Our opinion is that the Bundesbank interest rates 
have reached a level that is appropriate in the context of the 
present economic situation and current problems. 
  [Richter] The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised key interest 
rates once again. Will that block further decisions on the part 
on the Bundesbank? 
  [Issing] One cannot talk about blocking. Our decisions are 
generally based on the situation in Germany. The trend since 
the interest rates were raised in the United States and 
reductions in the interest rates were made in Germany shows that 
the interdependence is not as great as it is regularly made out 
to be. 
  [Richter] So, you are not concerned that the increase in 
U.S. interest rates will weaken the German mark? 
  [Issing] Much has been said about the German mark becoming 
weaker, but this has not in fact occurred. Confidence in the 
stability of the currency in the medium term is something that a 
central bank can and should supply. This kind of strategy also 
makes it possible for a currency to weather critical situations. 
We must remain cool and can be sure that, despite all the 
difficulties -- we do not dispute that fact -- we are on the 
right track. 
  [Richter] The money supply is growing much more rapidly than 
it should. Do you think this is dangerous? 
  [Issing] The figures on the money supply do indeed give us 
something to think about. We cannot be satisfied with the 
inflation rate, which was 3 percent in May and has thus reached 
the lowest level in years. In any event, the money supply 
figures have been affected by special factors since the end of 
last year. 
  [Richter] What sort of factors are they? 
  [Issing] For example, the lawmakers have included financial 
funds with accumulated interest in the tax on interest rates. 
This has led to a situation in which in December 1993 alone, 
German investors sold funds worth 25 billion German marks [DM]. 
The increase in interest rates that has come out of the United 
States and the higher degree of volatility in the financial 
markets have increased a tendency among investors to achieve 
higher liquidity. 
  [Richter] How long will it take for this excessive 
accumulation of liquidity to be eliminated? 
  [Issing] It will not happen overnight. However, I think 
that, from the point of view of time deposits, the growth in the 
money supply will slow down over the new next few months. 
  [Richter] Does the M3 money supply measure still provide you 
with reliable information for fiscal policy? 
  [Issing] The information that this indicator is furnishing 
at the present time makes some people wonder whether money 
supply definitions or the procedures for calculating the money 
supply should not be changed. However, at the present time, the 
growth in the M3 supply is not a problem that can be solved on a 
technical level. Other definitions also show that there is more 
than enough money. The problem is that excessive liquidity has 
to be eliminated. However, this should not happen through 
inflationary expenditure, but through long-term investment. 
  [Richter] In view of the public debt mountain and 
expenditure on interest that amounts to 20 percent of the 
budget, is there any room for maneuvering worth mentioning at 
all? 
  [Issing] If other areas at the macroeconomic level cannot 
contribute to stability, that will make things all the more 
difficult for monetary policy. However, I think that a new way 
of thinking has penetrated all areas. With the shock of German 
unity, fiscal policy did indeed come to grips with limiting 
expenditure far too late. Net new debt must be significantly 
reduced and there is a broad consensus on that. In the case of 
wage policy, there must be a clear improvement. This 
automatically means that things will be easier in the case of 
monetary policy, or, to be more exact, less difficult. 
  [Richter] How do you expect the economic situation to 
develop? 
  [Issing] There will be a clear improvement, but I think the 
present euphoria has gone too far. However, confidence also 
contributes to overcoming the recession. There has been a 
marked increase in foreign orders; the construction industry is 
as robust as before; even the problem child engineering is 
improving. There is a whole series of positive factors that 
allow one to expect a further improvement. 
  [Richter] What about private consumption? 
  [Issing] It is the biggest risk in the case of economic 
development. This year, after taxes, consumers will have less 
in real terms than a year ago. The prospects for next year are 
also not that rosy. Taxes and other deductions have reached a 
record level and will also rise next year. That applies to both 
private individuals and companies. This cannot be allowed to 
get any worse. Nowhere has the economic growth rate that we need 
been achieved with this level of taxation. 
  [Richter] Can one come to grips with unemployment with the 
current concepts? 
  [Issing] The problems that we have accumulated in this 
regard cannot be overcome with a one-shot wage freeze following 
the substantial wage increase of the past few years. We have to 
live for some time with this legacy. However, in conjunction 
with a whole series of measures aimed at achieving more 
flexibility, which has, for example, been the case with the wage 
settlements in the chemical and metal industries, it is a first 
step in the right direction. 
  [Richter] Despite strong resistance on your part, money 
market funds are in fact going to be permitted in Germany. Why 
has the Bundesbank given in? 
  [Issing] Following a substantial reduction in minimum 
reserve levels, we estimate that there is a danger that such 
funds will lead to the circumventing of our minimum reserves and 
that they will be of much less significance than in the past. 
We have, however, indicated our serious concern that the public 
purse is financing state debt on a short-term basis. That 
cannot and should not be the price for making Germany more 
attractive as a financial center. 
  [Richter] Would it become that by permitting new financial 
instruments? 
  [Issing] One should not believe in any wonders in this 
respect. Germany as a financial center is not something that is 
in itself desirable, but it should be attractive for German and 
international investors and secure investment should be 
possible. In particular, it should not make monetary policy more 
difficult from our point of view. 
  [Richter] Is that something that has to be feared? 
  [Issing] Yes, in the sense that money market funds can 
become substitutes for time deposits, for example, and they have 
be to added to the M3 money supply. One would have to consider 
whether investment in money market funds cannot be included in a 
new money supply measure. 
  [Richter] What risks to our financial system are concealed 
in the growing market for so-called derivative financial 
products? 
  [Issing] At first sight, in view of the ludicrous sums 
involved, derivatives financial products are ideally suited for 
scaring people away. Very few people realize that the risk 
potential in derivative financial products only accounts for a 
fraction of public money. They are not something terribly 
dangerous in themselves; what they are above all are instruments 
for providing security against risks. 
  [Richter] But they have always played a very big part in 
financial crises. 
  [Issing] There is not enough evidence for that with respect 
to the past. The main danger with these instruments is that 
people who cannot see or assume risks get involved with them. 
  [Richter] How fine is the dividing line between derivate 
products business and monetary policy? Do they make the federal 
bank's interest rate weapon ineffective? 
  [Issing] Until now, the relationship to monetary policy has 
been weak. That is why there is no new message for monetary 
policy from derivative products. However, if such products 
really will be used as investment instruments in Germany to a 
great extent, we will have to reconsider our monetary policy 
course. In any event, we must become better acquainted with 
this relationship and then draw the appropriate conclusions. 
The appearance of new financial instruments has concrete 
economic grounds. That is why it makes little sense to think in 
terms of prohibitions. 
  [Richter] With respect to Europe, it is not only the Germans 
who appear to be weary of Europe. 
  [Issing] The feeling of disillusionment is, of course, a 
reaction to the sometimes excessive euphoria of the past. The 
single market, Maastricht, the collapse of the Iron Curtain, 
initially created the impression that one could start 
immediately. Thus, "marry in haste, repent at leisure" can 
naturally be applied to the ambitious plans for establishing 
such close links between different nations. 
  [Richter] Is it not the case that integration seems to have 
become more difficult from the viewpoint of a timeframe as well 
as from that of the convergence criteria that have been adopted? 
  [Issing] The economic situation in Europe has changed. One 
could not have reasonably believed that the growth years would 
simply carry on without any problems. The convergence criteria 
clearly set out the homework that each individual country still 
has to carry out. That also applies to Germany. However, to 
conclude that the "Europe venture" has failed as a result is 
something that I consider just as premature as the previous 
euphoria.

<F P=106> [`pt'-signed report: "Schulte Calls For Expansion of </F>
Decisionmaking Rights"] 
  [Text] An investments program, a reconstruction program for 
eastern Germany, the introduction of a state industrial and 
scientific policy, and greater decisionmaking powers are some of 
the things Dieter Schulte, new chief of the German Trade Union 
Federation [DGB], called for in his inaugural speech. 
  The government has disregarded the trade unions' earlier 
readiness to share the burden of problems, said Schulte. "Now 
is the time for the strong to carry more than the weak, now is 
the time to finance out of the coffers what has too long been 
financed out of the pockets of employees," he said. "The social 
sphere cannot be cut any further." 
  Schulte criticized the Social Democratic Party of Germany's 
[SPD] announcement that it would investigate all social 
benefits. "I doubt whether it is a good idea for the SPD to seek 
agreement with the community of employers. After all, the SPD 
needs the votes of employees," he said. He warned the Christian 
Democratic Union against letting itself be dragged into a 
maelstrom of radical market forces. 
  Schulte reiterated his call for new rules governing the 
management of assets in the eastern laender and for a 
reconstruction program for that part of the country. He 
demanded an investment program involving economic growth and 
increased employment, and priority for public and private 
investments. A coordinated state industrial and scientific 
policy is a prerequisite for an ecological and economic renewal 
of the industrial society, he said. 
  "To reduce mass unemployment, which the trade unions still 
consider to be the cancerous tumor of a modern industrial 
society, it is essential to wage an educational campaign to 
improve the qualifications of workers and to share available 
jobs by shortening working hours," said Schulte. "Part-time 
work only stands a chance of success if a return to full-time 
work is possible and pensions are guaranteed." 
  Schulte countered the corporate concepts of lean production 
and lean management [preceding five words in English] with a 
call for greater voting rights by employees at all levels. 
"Employees should have greater rights to reach decisions 
concerning working time and conditions," said Schulte.

<F P=106> ["sm/jod"-signed report: "Telekom and France Telecom </F>
Establishing Worldwide Network"] 
  [Text] Bonn/Paris, 14 Jun -- German Telekom, France 
Telecom, and the U.S. Sprint Corporation are going to provide 
telecommunication services worldwide, Telekom's president of the 
board, Helmut Ricke, announced in Bonn. The cooperation between 
the two biggest providers of telecommunication services in 
Europe and the third-largest long-distance network provider in 
the United States will bring about an international market 
leader operating a worldwide network, Ricke pointed out. 
  Provided they get the necessary approvals, the two companies 
are planning to take two equal shares in Sprint totaling 20 
percent. Ricke said the entire share package is worth $4.2 
billion. This means that each of the two European partners 
would hold a portion of some 3.5 billion German marks [DM]. 
Telekom and France Telecom will have a seat and a vote in the 
most important decisionmaking bodies of their new partner 
company. 
  At a press conference held simultaneously in Paris, the 
chief 
of France Telecom, Marcel Roulet, stressed that in return for 
their investment in Sprint, the two partners will be given a say 
in strategic decisions. Asked about U.S. companies' access to 
the European market, Roulet said that all activities under the 
transatlantic partnership have been decontrolled. If the 
cooperation works well, Sprint might participate in France 
Telecom in the long run. 
  The alliance is the "logical continuation" of the intensive 
cooperation between Telekom and France Telecom that was agreed 
upon at the end of 1993. Under this cooperation, a joint 
venture will offer services worldwide as of 1995. It will be 
operating from Brussels and is expected to achieve a turnover of 
more than DM3 billion during its first year.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] For weeks now, indignation has 
been mounting across the world over the carnage in Rwanda. Do 
you believe that the intervention you have been advocating since 
yesterday can be of some use? 
  [Juppe] I hope so, with all my heart. We have been very much 
involved in the last few weeks, ever since this tragedy, which 
goes beyond the limits of horror, began. First of all, on the 
humanitarian front, you must know that there are already a 
number of nongovernmental organizations, the Red Cross, the 
UNHCR, with the help of France... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Excuse me, Mr. Juppe, but it 
is 
quite clear that humanitarian operations are not much use -- 
they are not, at any rate, sufficient... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] One moment, I would like to explain 
what we have done, because we cannot simplify things. We did 
this. We must remind people of this, we are still doing it 
today. There are people on the ground doing this, trying to 
evacuate young orphans from Kigali in order to get them to 
safety from the threat of extermination. Second, we have tried 
to obtain the dispatch of a United Nations force, and we had to 
fight for this in New York, but it is still not on its way. 
Finally, we tried to obtain a cease-fire. It was signed on 
paper yesterday in Tunis, thanks to all the diplomatic efforts 
we made. 
  [Correspondent] Yes, but it does not seem that it is being 
respected. 
  [Juppe] It is not being respected, and this is why today, 
faced with the impossibility of imposing a cease-fire, faced 
with the delays at the United Nations regarding the 5,500 men 
due to be sent to Rwanda, France has said: We are prepared to go 
in. We are prepared to go in because we have to put an end to 
the daily massacres. 
  [Correspondent] Very well: Is France prepared to go in 
alone? 
  [Juppe] No. We think that we have to go in with our European 
partners and with.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] With whom, then, since the 
Belgians today... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] Hang on, we cannot rush this, this is 
a 
serious matter... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting]. No, but this is an important 
issue, because we would like you to answer our questions. The 
Belgians today said that they were not prepared to go in -- 
logistic aid, perhaps, but certainly not men... 
  [Juppe, interrupting] You do know a lot, don't you? 
  [Correspondent] This is what we have heard from Belgium. 
Great Britain also says no. Can you name any countries? 
  [Juppe] If you allow me to say so, I would like to say that 
as soon as we broached this idea, without rushing into it, 
seriously of course, we tried to make some contacts. Those 
contacts were made this afternoon with our European partners, 
the Italians, the Belgians, the Spanish, and others, and we are 
currently examining what the response might be to France's 
initiative. 
  There must also be African countries taking part in this 
operation, and we have already received positive responses from 
several countries that I will not name because you must realize 
that this is a complex and dangerous operation, and a degree of 
discretion is necessary. 
  [Correspondent] By when do you expect results? 
  [Juppe] We have to move quickly, I think, but, I repeat, 
this 
operation is dangerous and it must be properly organized, in 
cooperation with officials in the Defense Ministry. This is why 
the president, the prime minister, the defense minister, and I 
discussed this issue yesterday, as soon as the idea had been 
broached with our partners. 
  [Correspondent] Do you envisage these soldiers being sent to 
Rwanda itself, or will they be based in neighboring countries 
for specific operations? 
  [Juppe] This is a humanitarian operation. We are talking 
about going in to save people. In your earlier report, we saw 
the survivors fleeing on the roads; others are surrounded, under 
immediate threat of extermination, and these are the people we 
would like to protect. 
  This is not a political intervention to separate one side 
from the other. It is a humanitarian operation to save people. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Even the Tutsi population, for whose 
protection this operation would be mounted, is not ready to 
welcome you. 
  [Juppe] I perfectly understand this reaction. The massacres 
and the horror were such that a good dose of passion and 
misunderstanding resulted. We have to remove this 
misunderstanding. We are talking to Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] officials in Brussels and Rwanda at this very moment to 
try to clarify the situation with them. I heard this RPF 
official saying that we are going to occupy Rwanda. As I 
explained to you a short while ago, it is quite the contrary. 
We are not about to mount a political operation in favor of one 
side or another, but on the contrary, to protect the entire 
population, the Tutsi population, first and foremost, when it is 
threatened. I hope that in clarifying this, we are talking 
about the same objective. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that in this country, where an 
unimaginable level of barbarism has been reached, humanitarian 
work can be done without the backing of a military operation? 
  [Juppe] Yes, obviously, it depends on what we do. We should 
know what we want. Forty-eight hours ago, or three or four days 
ago, France was accused of not doing enough. Today, we are the 
only country to say we are ready to go in there and we are still 
being told this is not enough. I think the decision -- which is 
a proposal, I must stress -- should be coordinated with our 
partners, with the green light from the United Nations, for a 
limited period of time and on the basis of clear objectives. We 
are not going to war in Rwanda, that is not the objective, let 
us be serious. We are going to mount an operation to save lives 
within the framework I described earlier. France is the first 
to make such a proposal; I think this deserves to be taken into 
consideration. If everyone says no, then everyone will assume 
their own responsibility. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] A final question, on Bosnia. Will our troops 
be back soon, has a date been set for their return from Bosnia? 
  [Juppe] Everybody knows that if nothing happens this summer, 
we will have to draw the necessary conclusions. People mention 
only the negative aspects of the conflict at the moment, in the 
vein of: What if it does not work? I would like to stress one 
point. A cease-fire has been holding for 10 days now. It took 
effect on 10 June and it has been observed. Some insignificant 
skirmishes have taken place here and there, but generally, peace 
has been restored, or at least the cease-fire is holding. 
Sarajevo is living again. The European Union has been busy 
laying down conditions for rebuilding the town of Mostar, 
devastated by war, with police forces working under the banner 
of the Western European Union. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] So our troops will remain there for the 
moment? 
  [Juppe] Yes, our troops will remain there. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The French Foreign Ministry has denied the report in 
the 17 June issue of the Brussels daily LE SOIR, which hints 
that two members of the French armed forces were involved in the 
attack in which the president of Rwanda was killed. The French 
Foreign Ministry describes this as a ridiculous allegation, 
recalling that previous unfounded rumors have circulated 
implicating foreign countries. 
  In Kigali the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the rebel 
movement of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, has just seized 
control of the Sainte Famille Church. It was held by the 
government forces and Hutu militias until now.

  [Text] French industrialists have for a long time been 
wanting to renew commercial ties with Iraq. With this in mind, 
a CNPF [National Council of French Employers] delegation will go 
to Baghdad on 24 or 25 June. Some 20 companies will be 
represented, among them Renault, Citroen, Alcatel, Schneider or 
EDF [Electricite de France]. Officially, however, Iraq remains 
under UN embargo. Olivier Dalage: 
  [Dalage] Everyone these days thinks that the lifting of 
sanctions is only a question of time, only months perhaps. 
French companies, like many others, are taking their places at 
the starting block to be ready to sign contracts the moment the 
UN Security Council lifts the sanctions. The first to do so 
were the oil companies, Elf and Total, who were on the scene in 
the months after the defeat of Iraq -- discreetly of course, but 
with the blessing of the French authorities. 
  Before the Gulf war Iraq was an important market for France. 
Since then, the United States has taken most of the Gulf 
markets. Only Iraq remains, if of course the embargo is lifted, 
but also if the French companies play their cards right against 
the competition. The French note that American managers have 
been much in evidence in Baghdad lately. These French-Iraqi 
contacts, which started off very discreetly, now take place in 
full daylight.

<F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure </F>
by Renaud de Chazournes; place and date not given: "Maastricht, 
Union or Community, Reforms: Alain Lamassoure Explains His 
Views" -- first paragraph is LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction] 
  [Text] In the aftermath of the European elections, European 
Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure analyzes for LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS the issues of European integration. He argues for a new 
founding document of a "Union" which has returned to being a 
"Community": fundamental reforms which, according to him, ought 
to be approved by referendum. 
  [De Chazournes] The Maastricht Treaty was approved by 
referendum. Could we return to a simple European Community by a 
simple amendment during the 1996 intergovernmental conference? 
  [Lamassoure] This could only be done by altering the treaty. 
Maastricht made provision for an update in 1996. What will be 
needed then is a far-reaching reform which, in my view, should 
be a new founding document for Europe to simplify the 
institutions and to ensure that Europe can welcome, in 
particular, the Central and East European countries. Among the 
measures which strike me as desirable is this change of name. I 
think that the name "Community" more effectively expresses the 
originality of European integration, better than "Union," which 
is more banal. What we are building is indeed a community of 
nations which maintain their sovereignty but which need to act 
together in a number of spheres. This does not resemble any 
other known model of political union. 
  [De Chazournes] The notion of community inevitably engenders 
an impression of a backward step. 
  [Lamassoure] It is not a backward step, it is a return to 
our 
roots. At the beginning, this community was only economic, and 
then it became political too. That is why it is a community. 
  [De Chazournes] But the European Union [EU] encompassed the 
achievements of the Treaty of Rome and the Single Act, to which 
were added economic and monetary union, the common foreign and 
security policy, internal affairs, and justice. Returning to a 
community could suggest that these three pillars of Maastricht 
are being abandoned. 
  [Lamassoure] This is obviously not what I am proposing at 
all. The Maastricht Treaty, in these spheres and in others, has 
led to complex solutions. Indeed, there is both the Community 
as it remains, and which is the only one to have a legal 
existence, to which is added a political union, which is 
competent in the new spheres which are foreign policy and 
questions of justice. I am naturally in favor of maintaining 
these areas of authority, but they must be developed and made 
more precise. To give two examples: The common foreign policy 
will be one of the fundamental dimensions of European activity 
in the coming years. Similarly, the policy of controlling 
immigration must now be conducted among 12 countries and in 
future among 16. To exercise this set of responsibilities, I 
repeat, the word "community" better reflects the originality and 
spirit of what we want to do. 
  [De Chazournes] You think that Europe must be "refounded and 
reinvented." How is it possible to have this ambition without 
renegotiating Maastricht? There can no longer simply be a 
revision of the treaty. 
  [Lamassoure] The treaty itself makes provision for its own 
adaptation and hence its own renegotiation in 1996. 
  [De Chazournes] So you do not reject the principle of 
renegotiation? 
  [Lamassoure] It is in the treaty. Everybody agrees on that. 
Of the 20 lists of candidates standing in the European 
elections, there was not one which rejected the 1996 conference. 
It will not then be a question of just minor adaptations in the 
European institutions, but a new founding document. We will 
therefore have to put the issue to the French people, because 
only the people can change what the people have done. We must 
also put the question of confidence to all our partners. 
Primarily, to our German partner, because European integration 
is still an edifice built on Franco-German foundations. 
  [De Chazournes] There will therefore be another referendum 
after the 1996 conference. 
  [Lamassoure] Precisely, and if this procedure can be 
generalized to all the countries concerned, so much the better. 
But that depends on each of them. 
  [De Chazournes] You have just reaffirmed your preference 
for a multispeed Europe. Does this notion have a limit? 
  [Lamassoure] A distinction must be drawn between an "a la 
carte" Europe and a multispeed Europe, which strikes me as 
inevitable and even desirable. An "a la carte" Europe would 
mean everybody taking from Europe what interests him and leaving 
the rest. That would be the opposite of solidarity. A Europe 
with several speeds means that, in the new agreement which will 
be signed in 1996, we must all agree on the Community's 
responsibilities. In other words, we must clearly redefine what 
subjects we want to handle jointly. But we can accept that some 
countries might need more time to achieve some objectives. This 
has already been accepted in the Maastricht Treaty with regard 
to monetary affairs. 
  [De Chazournes] But this goes further because Britain is 
exempt from it, if it so wishes. 
  [Lamassoure] This exemption must be called into question. We 
cannot accept that a country should remain indefinitely outside 
on such essential issues as the social policy or the single 
currency. These different speeds are the only method of enabling 
those who want to go further and quicker to advance without 
being held back by the slowest vehicle in the convoy. The 
policies for which different speeds can be accepted are, in 
addition to monetary policy, the common defense policy, the 
elimination of internal borders, and immigration policy. 
Conversely, the economic rules of the internal market and 
competition are subjects which will continue to be binding for 
all member countries. 
  [De Chazournes] Faced with the success of Philippe de 
Villiers' [anti-Maastricht] list, are you not tempted to 
moderate your European convictions? 
  [Lamassoure] Not at all. I expressed the principles of a new 
founding contract and a multispeed Europe during the election 
campaign. The truth is that the European debate has been 
caricatured between a vision of a little federal Europe, which 
was that of the founding fathers 20 years ago, and a Europe of 
nations. It is a European Community which is neither federal nor 
confederal which we are building.

<F P=106> [Article by Erich Inciyan: Five Priority Missions for the </F>
Police] 
  [Excerpt] Charles Pasqua's "law of orientation and 
programming regarding security" provides for a programming 
effort comparable to the Joxe plan for investments (materiel, 
equipment, furnishings), while assuring recruitment of 
administrative personnel and a package of more important 
categories of measures. 
  The government is assigning five "priority missions" to the 
police for the next five years: safety of persons and goods, 
control of immigration and the fight against clandestine labor, 
the fight against major criminality and drugs, protection 
against "external threats and terrorism," and the maintenance of 
public order. The message Charles Pasqua addressed to "his" 
police is clear: in these five priority sectors the police must 
obtain results at the level of effort agreed upon by the 
governmental security policy in a period of budgetary 
restriction. 
  The draft law, containing twenty-six articles, is 
accompanied 
by two appendices which define the government's security policy 
and the programming of means for the national police for the 
years 1995-1999. 

  -  Police, gendarmerie, customs officers: 
With authority over the entire country, the police and the 
gendarmerie have the "obligation" to cooperate with regard to 
equipment, technical and scientific police, the creation and use 
of files, and exchanges of information. The draft law also 
establishes their "obligation to share their allocations with 
each other and to rationalize geographic installations." The 
customs office sees its role recognized in combatting 
trafficking, especially of drugs, and fighting clandestine 
immigration and labor, without the customs officers becoming 
officers of the judicial police (OJP). Finally, a "reserve 
situation" is envisioned for those who have completed their 
national service in the police force; they will be recruited by 
the creation of a specific competitive entry examination. 
  -  Powers 
of police chiefs: In order better to coordinate the activities 
of decentralized services and forces dependent upon the state, 
the representatives of the state receive general authority for 
activities in crime prevention. In Paris, the chief of police 
coordinates the activities of the Ile-de-France police chiefs to 
"prevent or confront events which disrupt public order when they 
involve Paris and other departments of the region." 
  -  Municipal 
police and security agencies: The draft law recognizes the 
contribution provided by mayors to "the mission of public 
safety." The missions of the municipal police are limited "to 
activities which derive from the authority of the mayor." A 
draft law specific to the municipal police will be submitted 
"this summer." Another draft law will define the legal status 
and missions of guard agencies, money transporters, and 
investigative agencies. 
  -  Demonstration police: In order to 
protect the officials tasked with the maintenance of order, it 
is proposed to "prohibit the carrying and transport of material 
which could endanger the safety of persons and goods during 
demonstrations," as well as to permit "vehicle searches and the 
seizure of these materials." Also envisioned is "a supplementary 
punishment of prohibiting the participation in a demonstration 
at the same location to persons who have already been found 
guilty of violence during previous demonstrations." 
  -  Video 
surveillance and security measures: A legal framework will be 
established for the use of surveillance cameras on public 
streets and in places open to the public (stores, railroad 
stations). The general principle according to which the 
"security aspects" must be taken into account in laws and 
regulations "whatever the subject" is stated: large 
administration and construction programs (stadiums, housing 
projects) must include the security dimension. 
  -  Special status 
for police officers: In addition to the creation of three 
police corps, the minister declared that police officials will 
be granted "special status." The OJP status is granted to 
officers and commanders of the national police, which is in 
accord with the fusion of "uniformed" and "plainclothes" 
officers. 
  -  Ten billion francs over five years: Seven billion 
francs are allocated for police equipment and materiel (an 
increase of 71 percent over 1990-1994). Pasqua claims that this 
will permit a doubling of the effort devoted to transmissions 
and to computers, to furnishings and housing, while increasing 
the credits for weapons, clothing, and means of protection by 30 
percent. In addition, between now and 1999, 5,000 positions for 
police administrative and technical agents will be created (1.9 
billion francs). Measures for personnel (1.15 billion francs 
over five years) focus in particular on the establishment of a 
premium granted to "approximately 30,000 to 35,000 officials 
posted in difficult zones" in Paris and areas coming under city 
contract. [passage ommited]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian 
Democratic Union) has expressed the hope that Germany and Italy 
will work closely together within the framework of the European 
Union [EU], also under the government of new Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The task of the two countries is to 
guarantee a common future in Europe, Kohl said in Bonn today. 
  At the start of the short visit by Berlusconi, the 
chancellor 
said that the Italian prime minister has taken over 
responsibility for government at a time of "dramatic changes" in 
Italy as well as throughout Europe. Kohl also recalled that 
Germany and Italy have established stable democracies following 
the collapse of National Socialism and fascism. 
  Berlusconi gave the assurance that his government will 
respect the principles of freedom and tolerance. All forms of 
racism and antisemitism have to stay part of the past. 
Berlusconi pointed out that Italy and Germany currently have 
similar problems, such as unemployment, which they should tackle 
together. The Italian head of government called for a greater 
role for Europe in international relations. In this connection, 
he suggested the establishment of a European `Task Force' which 
should "intervene anywhere in the world where human rights are 
being violated." 
  According to the government, the focus of the concluding 
talks will be the outcome of the European elections and 
preparations for the German presidency of the EU in the second 
half of the year. Berlusconi plans to return to Rome this 
afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, the Central Council of Jews in Germany has called 
on the government to distance itself from the Italian 
Government. on Saarlaendischer Rundfunk, Michel Friedman, 
Presidium member of the Central Council, pointed to the presence 
of neofascist ministers in the new Italian cabinet. Contacts 
with these ministers should be limited to the "absolutely 
essential," Friedman demanded.

  [Text] Just after he arrived in Bonn, his first visit 
abroad, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi submitted a proposal: 
Italy wants to create an autonomous task force to defend human 
rights against suffering. But Prime Minister Berlusconi's visit 
has also given rise to controversy from the German Left on the 
presence of neofascist ministers in the Italian Government. 
Giovanni Masotti, our correspondent, reports from Bonn: 
  [Masotti] Silvio Berlusconi is making his first visit 
abroad, 
to Bonn, and the prime minister is again under pressure over the 
delicate matter of National Alliance ministers in the 
government. The controversy has been reopened by the German 
Social Democrats who are in serious difficulty following their 
defeat in the European elections and by the Greens. The 
left-wing opposition is asking Chancellor Kohl both to distance 
himself from Berlusconi and to stop Forza Italia from joining 
the European People's Party in the European Parliament. The 
accusation of having opened the door of government to the 
neofascists is rejected by the prime minister in an interview 
published today in the Bonn daily newspaper GENERALE ANZEIGER. 
Berlusconi says that the National Alliance party fully accepts 
and respects the Italian Constitution and the laws of the 
democratic state. It has nothing to do with Le Pen or the 
German extreme right-wing. The first goal that my government 
has set itself, Berlusconi stresses, is that of realizing and 
respecting the state of law. A press conference will be held in 
the afternoon by the prime minister. He will then immediately 
leave for Rome.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: "Intervening in </F>
Rwanda"] 
  [Text] The terrible tragedy which has struck Rwanda is one 
of the most murderous conflicts of the end of the present 
century. The horror of the massacres and the distress of those 
who have escaped overwhelm even the most indifferent. It would 
be too simple to explain the succession of dramatic events by 
some "fatal African penchant" for violence. 
<H5>  1. Crisis Has Both Political and Ethnic Origins </H5>
  Let us remind ourselves of what Rwanda was before President 
Habyarimana's assassination. After years of ethnic tension and 
of struggle for political power, there was some hope: The 
president, the moderate Hutus and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] had accepted talks and envisioned a sharing of power, 
thereby renouncing the temptation of military confrontation. 
The Arusha accords of 4 August 1993, to which France had 
contributed by persuading the Rwandan head of state to open up 
the political system and by organizing the initial contacts 
between the authorities and the RPF, are proof of this. Those 
who, in both camps, did not want these accords, precisely 
because they left a chance for peace and ruled out a military 
solution, did everything possible to delay their implementation. 
Everything, including the irreparable act: The assassination 
of the president who had accepted the voice of moderation. 
  Today Rwanda is confronted with a conflict which is both 
ethnic and political. We have to use the word genocide, as the 
active militia in the government zones are indeed intent on 
killing Tutsis -- men, women, children, the injured, and 
religious -- by the sole virtue of their ethnic origin. But at 
the same time, a merciless fight for power is being waged, in 
which the moderates have been the first victims of the Hutu 
extremists and in which the RPF's military wing has opted for 
total victory without concessions. 
<H5>  2. International Community Has Demonstrated Culpable </H5>
Passivity 
  None of this is tolerable. And everybody involved in this 
chaos carries his share of responsibility. France, people are 
quick to say, but not France alone. The policy which our 
governments have carried out for a number of years in Rwanda is 
certainly not infallible. The hundreds of thousands of victims 
in Rwanda for whom we weep today demonstrate the tragic limits 
of this. But one cannot tolerate any suspicion of the spirit in 
which French diplomacy worked in Rwanda. 
  France has never supported one Rwandan tribe against 
another. 
It has not ceased to hammer home one self-evident fact: There 
can be no military solution in Rwanda, nor can there be a 
political solution which consists of one single party 
confiscating power from all the others. This was true for 
President Habyarimana's party and still applies just us much to 
the RPF. There will be no durable settlement outside a sharing 
of power. This position of principle runs counter to those who, 
in both camps, dream of governing alone and without dialogue. 
If we did indeed manage to convince President Habyarimana to 
accept this compromise, the extremists in his clan did not 
intend things to be this way and acted to prevent the president 
from seriously implementing the Arusha accords. 
  But had the international community sought sufficient 
assurances that these accords would be implemented? I do not 
believe so. A year ago, France diplomacy led an intense 
campaign to enhance awareness, calling for the sending in of a 
UN force as provided for in what were to become the Arusha 
accords. Let us say it: International indifference toward 
Rwanda was at that time total. It took months for the United 
Nations to take up position on the Ugandan border, and then to 
set up the first UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) and 
have it leave for Kigali. Where are we today? Have the states 
involved (Security Council members, countries of the region) 
really learned the lessons of the drama which is being played 
out in Rwanda? I would like to believe so. The strengthened 
UNAMIR is not yet in the field. Let us not accuse the United 
Nations: This requires soldiers, and if African countries have 
answered courageously to the call, they have to be equipped. 
The French Government has released 20 million francs [Fr] for 
this purpose. I hope that other countries will follow suite and 
will act quickly. Nothing should be allowed to hold up the 
deployment of blue helmets, which is the one thing which will 
make it possible to save lives. 
  3. French Diplomacy Favors Political Settlement 
  It is not enough to call for the presence of one's United 
Nations in order to give oneself a good conscience. One must 
act. France was the first country to mobilize substantial aid, 
which has today exceeded Fr30 million, and to get it to those to 
whom it is destined: air lifts, support to the Red Cross, the 
UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees], to NGO's 
[non-government organizations], sending infrastructures to 
refugee camps, setting up an antenna of the world SAMU [Medical 
Emergency Ambulance Service]. No means, no channel has been 
neglected in order to come to the assistance of the civilian 
populations. 
  But humanitarian aid without a political program is quickly 
limited. We have successfully presented our views on a solution 
to the Rwandan crisis to the Security Council. We have also 
spelled it out to the countries close to Rwanda, by sending 
Jean-Michel Marlaud, our ambassador to Rwanda, whom I had 
personally mandated for this essential mission, to meet with 
their authorities. At the OAU meeting in Tunis, France urged a 
meeting of the heads of those African states which are the most 
concerned, which finally happened. 
  If France declared itself in favor of a rapid meeting of the 
heads of states neighboring on Rwanda, it is because interaction 
between the countries of the region and the permeability of 
borders are a reality which cannot be ignored and which can 
either play a pacifying role or which, on the contrary, can 
contribute to a general conflagration. Right now Tanzania and 
Burundi are being subjected to flows of refugees, and for these 
countries, the risks of destabilization are high. It would be 
particularly unjust if the sense of responsibility which has 
been demonstrated by Burundi's leaders since the outset of the 
crisis were to breached by contagion from extremists. With 
regard to Uganda and Zaire, it is essential that their leaders 
demonstrate the same constructive spirit and take every 
necessary measure to avoid the conflict being fueled from their 
territories. A mandatory arms embargo has been voted by the 
Security Council with our full support. It should be respected 
by everyone. 
<H5>  4. Rwanda's Future Requires Us To Support Moderates in All </H5>
Parties 
  What will be the future for Rwanda? A cease-fire and an end 
to the massacres must come before anything else. It will also 
be necessary to create the conditions for a return of the 
refugees. The United Nations will be able to make a major 
contribution here. Then there will be the need to pick up the 
political dialogue again, whatever the military situation on the 
ground. I hope that the desire for peace will win the day, and 
with it the concern for national reconciliation between Rwandans 
of goodwill. This naturally excludes those who have committed, 
encouraged, or provided cover for massacres. Above everything 
else, they must be identified in order to exclude them from any 
negotiations on the future of a country which they have 
contributed to destroying. France will show no good will toward 
the murderers or those who gave them their orders. France, 
which is the only Western country represented at ministerial 
level at the extraordinary session of the Commission for Human 
Rights at Geneva, demands that those responsible for these 
genocides be tried. 
  France will support those moderates who, despite the 
persecution which they have been subjected to, have survived -- 
and, France is proud to say, in many cases with our help -- and 
are ready to play their part once the conditions have once again 
been created. They will not be able to achieve this on their 
own. It is the duty of the international community to protect 
them, to support them, and to make sure that their voice is 
heard, and that the voice of every extremist is silenced. 
  Ours is a genuine duty to intervene in Rwanda. It is no 
longer enough to deplore the massacres with our arms folded, but 
it is time to take initiatives. The urgent need for 
international intervention should lead us to demonstrate 
imagination and courage. If the UNAMIR is slow in arriving in 
Rwanda, why not use a part of the 18,000 blue helmets which are 
still in Somalia, and which could reach Kigali quickly? I have 
proposed this plan to the UN secretary general, who is in favor 
in principle. We are working actively on getting it implemented 
via our permanent representative in New York. 
  If all this proves insufficient, France is ready, along with 
its main European and African partners, to prepare an 
intervention on the ground in order to put an end to the 
massacres and to protect the populations threatened with 
extermination. 
  No solution should be ruled out in order to bring the 
Rwandan 
tragedy to an end. France should play its full part in this 
effort.

<F P=106> [Report by Heinz-Joachim Fischer: "Conspicuously </F>
Berlusconi's First Foreign Trip Is to Bonn"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The new Italian prime minister, Berlusconi, 
will meet Chancellor Kohl during a brief visit to Bonn on 
Thursday [16 June]. It is Berlusconi's first foreign visit 
since he led a three-party center-right coalition to victory in 
the parliamentary elections in March, formed his cabinet on 10 
May, and then received a vote of confidence from the Senate and 
the Chamber of Deputies. Berlusconi's visit has thus highlighted 
Germany's importance for Italy as a partner of the highest order 
within the European Union as well as Kohl's significance for 
personal and substantive issues involving Europe's states 
against the background of the Commission in Brussels and the 
conferences that will take place on Corfu and in Naples over the 
next few weeks. 
  However, there is an element of excitement about the visit. 
Since the billionaire and media businessman Berlusconi decided 
to enter politics at the end of January, challenging the Left 
and winning the elections, and since accepting the postfascist 
National Alliance as a coalition partner, he has been the target 
of hefty criticism both in Italy and abroad. Reporting by some 
of the Italian media stems from unfriendly to hostile. Rome has 
noted with regret that the German media in particular have been 
launching attacks against the Italian Government, and the 
fierceness of the attacks is out of proportion to their content. 
To spare the guest from Italy a furor, it has been decided not 
to stage a general news conference in Bonn. It has been 
announced that Berlusconi will only be available to a few 
journalists at the embassy. In considering the pros and cons 
regarding Berlusconi, it should be borne in mind that his 
opponents do not necessarily represent a majority of the 
electorate. In contrast to Kohl, Berlusconi has successful 
national elections behind him; both of them can congratulate 
themselves as victors in the European elections. 
  Speaking to this newspaper, Foreign Minister Martino set out 
the government's field of activity. That the center-right 
coalition should encounter fierce opposition is no surprise. As 
head of Forza Italia, Berlusconi, along with his allies in the 
Northern League and the right-wing National Alliance, has 
started to change the corrupt party and state systems. He has 
been charged with doing so by a majority of the electorate. It 
is understandable that there are forces that oppose. Providing 
an example, Martino mentioned that since 1978, what was at that 
time the communist party and is now the opposition left-wing 
democratic party backed 95 percent of government budget policies 
and thus unrestrained state expenditure. 
  At that time, all the parties bought the support of voters 
with public expenditure. Now, the Italians have to expose the 
costs of that wastefulness, reduce costs, and be given an honest 
pay for their work. 
  The 52-year-old Sicilian Martino talked openly about the 
problem of fascism and fascists. He said that in his opinion, 
fascism was something entirely different from what appeared in 
Berlusconi's government program. As a liberal economist, he 
only joined up with Berlusconi because Berlusconi wants to 
reduce state intervention in the economy and society -- a 
difficult task in Italy, because of the high level of state 
involvement in the economy and an extravagant social system that 
cannot be financed. Both these phenomena stem from the fascist 
period, but have been stubbornly defended by the parties over 
the past few decades. The program is being supported by the 
five National Alliance ministers, because they are not fascists, 
said Martino. In his opinion, the polemics about fascism will 
die down. Martino did, however, concede that representatives of 
the National Alliance had made unnecessary, damaging statements: 
The lack of wisdom about those statements was balanced out by 
statements in a similar vein on the other side. On the other 
hand, the advantage of these exchanges of differing views was 
that greater clarity had emerged. He described his meeting with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Peres on Monday [13 June] as "cordial 
and friendly," and "friendlier than would have been the case if 
certain statements had not been made." 
  Regarding policy on Europe, Martino and the Berlusconi 
government share the chancellor's view that content and the 
joint goal are more important than the timeframe. This 
indicates that he is a supporter of a free market and does not 
think much of Brussels dirigism and unnecessary EU intervention 
in national sovereignty. "Intervention from above justifies 
division, harms interests, and restricts free trade," said 
Martino. This also showed that the foreign minister was in tune 
with the feelings of his voters, who do not appreciate being 
told what to think by politicians and made to display enthusiasm 
about Europe. There is no doubt in Martino's mind that Italy 
will seek to fulfill its European duties. Martino has a 
consolation ready for the Christian-Democrat chancellor in Bonn, 
who will no longer be able to speak to an Italian 
Christian-Democrat head of government. Berlusconi's "Italia" is 
a "recovered Democrazia Cristiana," a popular party of the 
center, which is open-ended in the case of voters on the Right 
and whose limits on the Left are the competing opposition 
parties.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Lower House President Rita 
Suessmuth and her Russian counterpart Ivan Rybkin have advocated 
greater cooperation between the two parliaments. Rybkin 
emphasized in Bonn today that the industrial-cultural exchanges 
are to be stepped up. The Russian parliamentary president, who 
had also met Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Federal 
President Richard von Weizsaecker, reviewed his talks 
positively. He emphasized: "We Russians and Germans cannot live 
without one another." 
  Kohl paid tribute to Rybkin's conciliatory role in Russian 
politics. At the same time, the chancellor underlined Germany's 
"vital interest" in the continuation of the democratic and 
economic reform process in Russia on the basis of stable 
framework conditions, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said. 
He also said that the politicians agreed "that bilateral 
relations are free of fundamental and insoluble problems." In 
the interest of the two countries and of the whole of Europe 
this positive starting position should be put to use and 
developed further.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the Bundesrat </F>
session in Bonn on 20 May: "Great Expectations"] 
  [Text] We are going to use the period of Germany's 
European Unity [EU] presidency from 1 July to further 
consolidate the European dimension of German foreign policy. In 
particular we want to do this with France, which will take over 
the presidency from us. We have agreed that as part of the 
troika, in which we will find ourselves for one year, we will 
tackle important European tasks in close partnership and 
cooperation. The French foreign minister and I concur that the 
German-French partnership remains a firm condition for European 
unity and further integration. 
  Four features will characterize our EU presidency. First, 
Europe needs a stimulus for modernization to enter the 
information age, if we are to create future jobs in global 
competition with North America and Asia. We Europeans will only 
survive the changes if we change ourselves. 
  The rapid and determined implementation of the action plan 
of 
the Council of Europe in Brussels will be quite high on the 
agenda of the Council of Europe in Essen. Therefore the 
government considers it a priority matter to overcome the 
obstacles to private initiative and self-responsibility among 
citizens, especially in view of the difficult budget situation. 
We must also not make citizens in Europe dependent solely or 
primarily on the state. 
  Second, the prosperity gap between us and the countries of 
Central Europe must be overcome, and our eastern neighbors must 
be brought closer to the western zone of stability. During the 
election campaigns, especially the European election campaign, I 
have been trying to provide a single example that illustrates 
what we are concerned with. An hourly wage in Leipzig and 
Dresden, and I deliberately mention cities in the new laender, 
is equal to half a day's wage in Budapest, a day's wage in 
Poland, and a monthly wage in Kiev. That illustrates the 
problems. 
  I will continue to inform our European partners that we 
cannot suddenly tell the countries of Central and East Europe 
that there is no room for them in our European home after we 
have been telling them for decades to abandon communism and 
their system and join the Western community. 
  Third, if we do not want to lose the support of our citizens 
for Europe, we must urgently achieve progress in expanding 
Europol and formulating a common refugee, asylum, and 
immigration policy. That will be a decisive test for Europe. 
  Fourth, we must do everything we can to consolidate the EU 
during our presidency and, in this respect, prepare for the 1996 
government conference. We are dealing with more than just an 
ideological dispute about whether the EU should consolidated or 
whether it should be expanded. We are dealing with an issue 
that will affect the future European Parliament, and with 
justification. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, during our EU presidency we Germans 
want to provide good examples. Many eyes will be fixed upon us 
from 1 July onward, and there will be great expectations of us. 
That concerns everyone, both the federation and the laender. 
Therefore we must commit ourselves fully and perform our task 
with zest. 
  The presidency's task will be to establish top priorities 
that serve the interests of the community. These priorities 
need not always converge with national priorities, but it has 
been proved again and again that German interests are best serve 
when they are implemented together with our partners. National 
and European interests are always closely linked. That applies 
to the French and Dutch no less than it applies to us, and that 
will be the most important signpost for our presidency.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- On the occasion of the 41st 
anniversary of the popular uprising in the German Democratic 
Republic [GDR], Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to all 
German democrats "resolutely to oppose the enemies of freedom." 
Anyone playing down the Socialist Unity Party of Germany regime 
today was jeopardizing the "fundamental antitotalitarian 
consensus" in Germany, Kohl said in Bonn today. The same 
applied to those who sought to suppress the crimes of the 
national-socialist tyranny. Kohl added: "Left-wing and 
right-wing radicalism is shameful for our country." 
  The chancellor emphasized that remembering the popular 
uprising in the GDR of 17 June 1953 remained topical even after 
German unification. It united all democrats in the belief that 
there should never be another dictatorship. History has proved 
those right who at the time had "worked courageously and 
selflessly for freedom and German unity." Kohl recalled that 
the peaceful uprising in Berlin, Jena, and many other industrial 
centres of the former GDR was "brutally put down by the 
communist power apparatus."

<F P=106> ["C.G."-initialled report: "FDP Rejects Alliances With PDS"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The FDP [Free Democratic Party] has rejected 
local alliance with the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism] 
following their successes in the local elections in eastern 
Germany. Responding to an announcement by SDP Deputy Chairman 
Thierse that the SPD was ready to form coalitions with the PDS 
at the municipal level, FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Solms said 
in Bonn on Wednesday [15 June]: "That would be out of the 
question for the FDP." The FDP will not cooperate with the PDS 
at the local or any other level, just as it will not cooperate 
with the Republikaner. FDP General Secretary Hoyer accused the 
SPD of evidently wanting to assist the SED [Socialist Unity 
Party of Germany] successor party to achieve respectability with 
its "tendency toward expressions of friendship." 
  On Tuesday evening, the FDP Bundestag Group debated for 
hours 
about its poor performance in the European elections, but there 
were no demands for personnel changes or changes of directions. 
However, like the party's federal board, the group also 
expressed concern that the FDP's image as "an independent force" 
is only perceived in a blurred way as a result of numerous 
compromises with the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU 
[Christian Social Union] coalition partners in Bonn. The FDP 
must place more emphasis on its independent character in the 
election campaign. On Wednesday, Solms justified the agreements 
within the coalition: "It would have been much worse to reject 
compromise and thus be unable to make any decisions in German 
politics." 
  As a result of the "inevitable" Bonn compromise, supporters 
of the FDP voted for the CDU, said Solms. "The FDP lent votes 
to the CDU/CSU" and the FDP will get them back. The FDP will 
make it clear that the coalition cannot be continued if the FDP 
is not strengthened. The FDP will hold discussions with the 
Greens and show that the FDP still represents views based on the 
rule of law state, even if those views are not currently the 
focus of attention. The Greens cannot pretend to be a modern FDP. 
  Speaking to this newspaper, board member Baum said: "What 
we, essentially, have once again is a debate about direction." 
The CDU/CSU has "shifted to the right." That has affected the 
FDP's politicians specializing in economics. Left-wing liberals 
have not gone to the CDU/CSU, but to the Greens, and they must 
be won over again. The FDP must ask itself: "Where are the 
voters -- are they to the right or left of the center?" The 
only answer can be to seek lost territory to the left of the 
center. That is something that economic liberals, out of 
concern for their seats, have recognized: "Many would most of 
all like to carry Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
like a monstrance in front of them and immediately drop her 
after the Bundestag elections."

<F P=106> [Interview with Lothar Bisky, chairman of the Party of </F>
Democratic Socialism, by Wolfgang Huebner; place and date not 
given: "Five Percent Is Not a Distant Goal Any More"] 
  [Text] [Huebner] The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] 
has stopped short of moving into the European Parliament. What 
does that mean for this Parliament? 
  [Bisky] It means that the European Parliament will lack a 
clear left-wing opposition voice. There will be no opportunity 
for contact with other left-wing parties in Europe. Nor will 
there be strong opposition to the Maastricht Treaties. 
  [Huebner] Will the PDS give up its interest in European 
policy? 
  [Bisky] No, we are considering setting up a Europe office in 
Brussels. We will examine this closely. We do not, by any 
means, intend to neglect contacts with left-wing parties of 
other countries and are seeking cooperation with them. 
  [Huebner] You missed the 5 percent for the European 
Parliament, but achieved remarkable results at the communal 
level. What do you consider more important? 
  [Bisky] The election results have caused amusement rather 
than concern in the PDS. The results of the communal elections 
are excellent. It has become clear that Brandenburg was no 
exception, but we have achieved major gains in all new federal 
laender, above all, in the big cities. This is an important 
sign of approval for our candidates, who had a difficult 
election campaign. 
  It is a bitter thing that we lack 0.3 percent for Europe. We 
must state this clearly. We missed our goal by a narrow margin. 
However, with 4.7 percent, we almost doubled our 1990 Bundestag 
elections result, when we got 2.4 percent on an all-German 
basis. This is a very hopeful sign, indicating that we can 
overcome this very narrow margin and reach 5 percent in the 
Bundestag elections. In addition, the upcoming Bundestag 
elections will be marked by other characteristics. We still 
think that 5 percent for the PDS in October is a realistic 
estimate. 
  [Huebner] The PDS certainly profited from a relatively low 
voter turnout on 12 June, which you cannot expect in October. 
  [Bisky] That may be partly true. But it is not true that 
only the low voter turnout led to such a result. In Berlin, for 
instance, we won 40,000 votes in absolute terms, compared with 
communal elections in May 1992. This shows that we not only 
live on our traditional voters, but can also win over new voters. 
  [Huebner] Is the east exhausted for the PDS, or is it still 
possible to get many more votes there? 
  [Bisky] I do not know whether we can get much more. But in 
any case, there is still a certain potential among non-voters; 
and among the non-voters, there are also people who have a 
leftist orientation and would fully accept our policy programs. 
Some of them are prejudiced against the PDS because they 
believe perhaps that the party still has something to do with 
the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. 
  [Huebner] Has the PDS lost the European elections in the 
west? 
  [Bisky] Yes, certainly, even though we have also made gains 
in the west.... 
  [Huebner] Minor gains. 
  [Bisky] We had twice as many votes as we had in 1990 in the 
west. 
  [Huebner] However, in 1990, the party hoped to gain a 
foothold in the west by the end of this election period. This 
has not materialized. 
  [Bisky] You are right. Nonetheless, and for this very 
reason, we will intensively continue our election campaign in 
the west. I think we have a chance of getting a million votes 
in the old federal laender. 
  [Huebner] The PDS is attempting to become an all-German 
party; its election results say just the opposite. 
  [Bisky] This is partly attributable to the fact that the 
results in the east are continuously improving. I do not 
deplore this. The reason we got so few votes in the west is the 
fact that it is extremely difficult to be accepted there. The 
people there have very strange ideas about the PDS. We are a 
somewhat unknown party there; we can do nothing but go there, 
organize meetings, and inform people. 
  [Huebner] The PDS started at zero in the west in 1990. If 
the party has not made much progress since then, should you not 
have a closer look at the way you were trying to expand to the 
west? 
  [Bisky] I do not dispute this. But if I knew a better way 
to gain a foothold there, I would make use of it. We do not 
have the ideal method guaranteeing prompt success. Therefore, 
we have to pursue the difficult road. 
  [Huebner] Following the European elections, what is more 
realistic for the Bundestag elections -- to overcome the 
5-percent hurdle, or get at least three direct seats? 
  [Bisky] At any rate, the direct seats. We see this in east 
Berlin where we had excellent results in the three promising 
constituencies, and in a number of other cities. However, with 
4.7 percent on a republic-wide basis, the 5-percent hurdle is no 
longer a distant goal.

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Looking toward the anniversary 
of 17 June [1953 uprising in East Berlin], CSU [Christian Social 
Union] General Secretary Erwin Huber has called for a "decisive 
examination" of the "legacy of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of 
Germany] regime." If the successor party PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialism] could get 25 percent of the votes in the 
local elections in the states of former East Germany, this is a 
serious danger for stability and internal peace in Germany, 
Huber said in Munich today. 
  Huber called on the SPD [Social Democratic Party] to clearly 
dissociate itself from the "SED-PDS." Any cooperation with this 
"left-wing extremist organization" has "to be taboo for a 
democratic party." The CSU will never let the "demons of 
dictatorship" again threaten the freedom of people in Germany.

  [Text] Vienna, June 17 (AFP) -- A convention on the safety 
of civilian nuclear power plants was adopted in Vienna on Friday 
[17 June] by an international conference grouping 
representatives of 84 countries. 
  It is to be signed here next September, on the sidelines of 
the annual general conference of the Vienna-based International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The agreement is based on the principle that safety of 
nuclear plants is within the sole jurisdiction of the countries 
maintaining them, and it does not provide for any inspection 
mechanism to ensure required safety standards are met. 
  The standards laid down by the conference relate to sites, 
construction plans, installation maintenance, control systems 
and measures to be taken in case of emergency.

<F P=106> [Francoise Varenne report: "Chirac: `A Military </F>
Intervention Is Needed in Rwanda'"] 
  [Text] New York -- Taking advantage of his brief visit to 
New York, where he attended, as a jury member, the announcement 
of the winners of the Japanese Imperial Prize (the Japanese 
equivalent of the Nobel Prize for artistic disciplines), Jacques 
Chirac visited UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  During a meeting which lasted 45 minutes, the former prime 
minister informed his interlocutor of the "anxiety and horror" 
he feels at the Rwandan tragedy which is "a veritable genocide." 
  "It is absolutely vital to react," he said, holding the view 
that "the Western nations, in close liaison with the African 
nations, under UN influence, ought to intervene now," and he 
said he is convinced that France would participate in this 
action. 
  Jacques Chirac suggested to Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the 
18,000 blue helmets currently in Somalia should be sent to 
Rwanda. "At all events, a military intervention is necessary," 
he said, adding that he had the impression that his interlocutor 
"was definitely of the same view." 
<H5>  Drugs: Taking Action Where They Are Produced </H5>
  In addition, just as he had lengthy discussions on the drugs 
problems with President Clinton during his visit to Paris last 
week, Jacques Chirac argued for a "right of intervention at the 
initiative of the United Nations and under UN control" which 
would have the aim of destroying crops in the producer 
countries. "These initiatives should be taken in agreement with 
the countries concerned, who are seeing a growing consumption of 
drugs inside their own borders, while making provision for 
compensating the farmers," the Rally for the Republic president 
explained. 
  "Aside from prevention and repression," he explained, 
"action 
should be taken at the site of production," adding that this 
production, and especially that of hard drugs, is increasing in 
a dramatic way, "with the consequences with which we are 
familiar for individuals, and especially for young people, and 
also for the spread of AIDS. We also know the effect on wars, 
because it is the money from drugs which enables the purchase of 
weapons which are ever cheaper and which are then used to fight 
all kinds of ethnic confrontations. Finally, it is drugs which 
finance terrorism. If nothing is done, we will witness the 
destabilization of the whole world." 
  Jacques Chirac, who, in agreement with Bill Clinton, has 
decided to set up a working group to study the means of 
eradicating the scourge, intends to continue his awareness 
campaign. "This naturally depends on a mobilization of the 
United Nations without which," he said, "nothing can be done on 
this scale, and in close liaison with the Americans, who consume 
almost half of the world production."

was carrying, two of them British military experimental 
satellites. (Dominique Andre), you were at the launch [from 
Kourou space center in French Guiana] and you are now at 
Arianespace headquarters in Evry [south of Paris] 
  [Andre] Yes, and Ariane is back in action again at last. The 
European rocket completely succeeded in its 64th mission this 
morning by putting into orbit the Intelsat telecommunications 
satellite, as well as two small satellites for the British 
Ministry of Defense. 
  This flight has put the smile back on the faces of the 
Ariane 
engineers. This success is the first of the year, after the 
failure in January and the false start at the beginning of June, 
but now they are going to have to move quickly, or rather well 
and quickly, to quote the head of Arianespace, in order to stick 
to the new program--in other words, eight more launches this 
year. The Ariane team based in Kourou is going to be beefed up 
with technicians and engineers. The next launch is due to take 
place on 8 July, in three weeks' time. Dominique Andre in Evry

  [Text] It is no secret that European and African states are 
rather reluctant to intervene in Rwanda. Today, Paris has 
multiplied its efforts to persuade them by stressing the purely 
humanitarian aspect of the operation. In Brussels the Western 
European Union [WEU] has been considering French proposals. WEU 
Secretary General Willem van Eekelen explains: 
  [Begin van Eekelen recording] Everyone agrees that the 
situation in Rwanda is tragic and that we must see if European 
countries can do something. The WEU will now consider how it 
could coordinate extra contributions from European countries 
under the aegis of the United Nations. Our planning cell has 
been allowed to get in touch with capitals to see which 
capabilities, which means, could be placed at our disposal and 
closely to follow developments. This is a start, and now a 
possible scenario must be assessed, we must then see which 
countries will be able to contribute. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Ph. L." report: "Alain Lamassoure Calls For Reduction of </F>
European Commission Powers"] 
  [Text] An aftershock of the European election? An 
acknowledgement of the supposed hostility of some 23 percent of 
right-wing and extreme-right-wing French voters (those who chose 
the de Villiers and Le Pen lists) toward "Brussels' 
technocrats?" In any case, since recently, French officials 
have appeared rather forceful in their determination to take 
advantage of the 1996 intergovernmental conference on EU 
political and institutional reform to reduce the powers of the 
European Commission. 
  "The status of the Commission as de facto exempt from any 
answerability" (in theory the European Parliament can censure 
it, but it has never seriously considered such a move) "is 
outdated, it is dead, it is no longer tolerated by the public," 
French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure told 
journalists on Monday 13 June. Speaking on the occasion of the 
meeting of the Twelve's Council of Ministers, Mr. Lamassoure 
explained that he did not mean to have the slate wiped clean, 
that there was much to preserve in the way the Community works, 
including institutionally, but that the current system had 
become unbearable, that it was obsolete, and that -- "a true 
innovation" -- the Commission must be made answerable both to 
the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. 
  This would not be the only reform, and the Commission's 
powers would be reduced even further. The French have been 
thinking of establishing, through the Council of Ministers, 
another authority which would be in charge of the Union's common 
foreign and security policy and would be headed by a personality 
with real powers and a clear brief. According to Mr. 
Lamassoure, the new treaty to be developed in 1996 as a 
replacement for the one devised in Maastricht should be 
subjected to a new referendum. "Only a referendum can alter 
what the people have instituted by means of a referendum; the 
idea is self-evident."

<F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Baudouin Bollaert: "RPR </F>
Members of European Parliament Go It Alone"] 
  [Text] Despite the commitment made at the beginning of the 
European election campaign, the 14 RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
members elected as part of the Baudis [majority's "Union"] list 
will not join the European Peoples' Party (EPP) group in 
Strasbourg. Rather than embracing the largely federalist 
Christian Democrat family, they decided to create a new, 
independent parliamentary group, modeled on the RDE (Rally of 
European Democrats), whose president in the previous Parliament 
was Gaullist Senator Christian de la Malene. 
  This decision was made two days ago, that is, even before 
Dominique Baudis and other elected list leaders were scheduled 
to meet with [French Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur at the 
Hotel Matignon. LE FIGARO has been told that the RPR 
Eurodeputies will team up with seven Fianna Fail members 
(Ireland), three Portuguese MP's belonging to Mr. Monteiro's 
center-right Nationalist Party, and two or three Greek MP's 
close to Mr. Samaras and "New Democracy." 
  In total, according to reliable sources, 26 to 27 deputies 
will advocate a Europe of Nations as opposed to a supranational 
Europe. The same source adds that the 14 RPR deputies will 
defend "France's position in Europe" while attempting to update 
the "Gaullist message." Neither the new group's name (the RDE 
acronym may be retained) nor the name of its president are known 
yet. All this will become official during the new Parliament's 
first session, to be held from 19 to 22 July in Strasbourg.

<F P=106> [Article by David Barroux and Eric Chol: "Opening to </F>
the East: Europe No Longer Has a Choice"] 
  [Text] Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians are knocking at the 
door of the European Union [EU]. The Twelve in principle favor 
expansion to the east, but the Union's difficulties are forcing 
them to delay its implementation, even if this means 
accumulating risks and resentments. 
  Politics? It is the object of Jirina Hinnerova's ridicule. 
Like all Slovakian youth, she retains an exalted memory of the 
events of the autumn of 1989. "We were all in the street 
demanding that the government resign," she says. The Berlin Wall 
was coming down, and the Iron Curtain was parting all the way 
from Budapest and Bucharest to Prague and Warsaw. "We did not 
know much about Europe and the West, but we thought everything 
would go forward rapidly," the young Slovakian woman recalls 
today. Five years later, Jirina has succumbed to skepticism. 
"Nothing has really changed where the economy is concerned," she 
says. "We will have to wait another two or three years to join 
the European Union." That may be a self-gratifying illusion, 
inasmuch as the member states--which following the Copenhagen 
summit in June 1993 embraced the principle of a greater 
Europe--expect that it will be at least another 10 years before 
the countries of Central and East Europe join the EU. Although 
Germany is seeking to accelerate the process, the consensus is 
to proceed slowly. This cautiousness, however, could prove to be 
disastrous, because the opening to the East is an urgent 
necessity for the continent as a whole. 
  It goes without saying that the opening to the East is an 
urgent necessity for the countries involved. Weakened by the 
transition that is taking place in their respective economies, 
they are also worried about the resurgence of Russian 
imperialism and about the problems of ethnic minorities inside 
their own borders, given that the end of the Cold War has 
revealed many wounds that have not completely healed. They view 
an accelerated rapprochement with the EU as a means to obtain 
the guarantees they need. "Why add partners who are so different 
from us, when we already have difficulty managing a 12-nation 
Union?" the EU "realists" counter--but they are forgetting three 
things. First of all, EU membership for the countries of the 
East--from Lithuania to Romania--is the concept cited at the 
very beginning of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome. Second, 
Europe encouraged these countries to rid themselves of Soviet 
tutelage and therefore can hardly play the role of a Pontius 
Pilate today. "In 1989 we aroused a feeling of euphoria in these 
countries," notes Pierre Lellouche, diplomatic adviser to 
Jacques Chirac and a fervent advocate of the rapid integration 
of the countries of East Europe. "We no longer have the time to 
play legal games," he explains. Lastly, the EU's opening to the 
East represents an insurance policy for Europe itself--provided 
it is not delayed, because the opportunity that arose in 1989 
with the collapse of the Berlin Wall could one day be lost, 
inasmuch as Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and Balts perceive the 
Russian threat to be much greater than we do. Moreover, the 
threat of an economic recession would inevitably exasperate the 
problems of minorities and therefore provoke a demographic 
afflux to the West that is in fact just over the horizon. "In 
any event, we shall either integrate the East politically or 
integrate it demographically," says Patrick Devedjian, RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] deputy and mayor of Antony, who is one 
of the most active parliamentary supporters of the concept of 
Greater Europe. 
  The opening to the East is also a factor for stability, in 
that it represents an economic opportunity for the Union--a 
market of 70 million to 100 million consumers to satisfy; a 
market for the rebuilding of factories; and a geographically 
proximate area whose capacity for imports is growing more 
rapidly than its ability to export. "In less than one 
generation," Patrick Devedjian concludes, "the problems relating 
to adaptation will be solved and these countries will become new 
markets. We have the opportunity to open our doors to new 
markets that we can win and that are culturally close to us. Let 
us aid these markets." 
  There remains the question of how to aid them. The obstacles 
encountered during the negotiations for expanding the Union to 
include the Scandinavian countries and Austria--which are 
prosperous and democratic nations--bear witness to the 
resistance to be overcome. "Europe must be prepared to cease 
being a club [preceding word in English] of rich people," Pierre 
Lellouche warns. Quite frankly, a Europe consisting of 20 or 
more countries will be unable to function on the model conceived 
by the signatories of the Treaty of Rome. Not just the economic, 
institutional, and political aspects but the entire complex of 
Community mechanisms is in danger of flying into pieces, thereby 
putting an end to a very French concept of European integration. 
Conscious of the sacrifices to be made and the disputes to be 
resolved, Europe is moving forward hesitantly. Are its fears 
justified? 
  In the economic area, it is doubtful that these fears are 
justified. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the countries of the 
East would probably not be the only beneficiaries of a 
free-trade zone. As exporters these countries are lightweights, 
inasmuch as they account for less than 4 percent of Community 
imports. For the immediate future, no tidal wave of exports from 
the region is expected to occur, because the EU is already 
taking between 50 and 75 percent of its exports, which--for a 
broad range of products--still come into conflict with Western 
quality standards. 
  Although the East's sales to the West jumped 56 percent 
between 1988 and 1992, trade in the other direction registered 
an even sharper rise of almost 90 percent. The EU--which in 1990 
recorded a trade deficit of 957 million ecus with the 
East--posted a surplus of more than 4 billion ecus for the first 
three quarters of 1993. In the case of France, the trade balance 
went from a deficit of 245 million ecus in 1989 to a surplus of 
650 million in 1992. This imbalance, however, was nothing 
extraordinary: deprived of Western products ever since 1945, the 
consumers and manufacturers of the East are making up for lost 
time. "The balance is so heavily in our favor that it is 
becoming almost awkward," a European official acknowledges. 
  At Bercy [Finance Ministry], the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign 
Ministry], and Brussels it is emphasized that the association 
agreements have already brought progress. Signed between 1991 
and 1993, they have made it possible to ease trade restrictions 
with a view to creating a free-trade zone five to 10 years from 
now. Unfortunately, these agreements do not cover certain 
sectors that are vital for the countries of Central Europe but 
that are "sensitive" sectors for the West--the agricultural 
sector (which is totally excluded except for a few concessions) 
and the textile, clothing, and steel sectors, for which 
additional time is allowed for implementation--and fail to 
include clauses that would provide safeguards and antidumping 
restrictions. These sectors are indeed vital for the countries 
of the East, inasmuch as they account for 40 percent of the 
East's exports to the West. Indignant at being accused of 
practicing a form of "disguised protectionism," the Commission 
counters that Europe has made efforts that are unmatched by the 
other developed countries. In private, however, the opening is 
acknowledged in Brussels to have been a modest one. In 
1991--when the association agreements were being prepared--the 
commissioner then in charge of the dossier, Frans Andriessen, 
tried unsuccessfully to obtain a more generous mandate. 
<H5>  The Opening Would Require an Additional 45 Billion Ecus for </H5>
the Structural Funds 
  This is a sensitive issue among the various national 
constituencies, especially in France. First of all, the 
countries of the East frighten European farmers. "Even though 
they do not compete with us today, they are potential rivals in 
markets that are saturated," explains former Agriculture 
Minister Francois Guillaume. However, was not the end of French 
agriculture predicted when the negotiations for Spain's 
admission to the Community were taking place, whereas Spain has 
actually become a market for--and net importer of--agricultural 
products? 
  Employment has become another cause for concern, because of 
the relocations to the East that are feared by Senator Jean 
Arthuis. It has not been proved conclusively, however, that the 
balance in respect to employment is unfavorable for the West. A 
study made by the economist Claude Vimont concludes that trade 
relations with the countries of East Europe translate into a 
positive balance in terms of jobs. While acknowledging the 
effort at adaptation that is necessary, UDF [French Democratic 
Union] Deputy Willy Dimeglio argued in a recent report that 
these relocations will not lead to a loss of jobs in France, 
because the companies that are currently involved in relocation 
are maintaining and developing activities in France which have a 
high added value. 
  The financial and institutional questions are considerably 
more sensitive. If the EU opens up to the countries of the East, 
it will have to revise its operations and its policies from top 
to bottom. The structural funds--which are dedicated to the 
development of disadvantaged regions--would require a trifling 
45 billion additional ecus per year. That would break the 
European budget, which has already reached 73.5 billion ecus in 
1994. All in all, the European Commission believes that the 
budget for the structural funds and for the Common Agricultural 
Policy would have to be doubled if the countries of the East 
were to be allowed the same criteria for aid as those granted to 
the countries of southern Europe. Are the member states prepared 
to make such a financial outlay? Although the Germans are the 
ones most agreeable to the opening, they complain that they are 
putting too much into Europe's common pot at a time when the 
rebuilding of their new laender has not yet been completed. The 
solution--which would entail the exclusion of the newest members 
from the aid provisions--is politically unfeasible. The 
expansion accordingly involves a proportional reduction in the 
amounts of the structural fund packages, in order to make room 
for the newcomers without overloading the boat. Spain, Portugal, 
and Greece--which are major beneficiaries of the Community's 
ecus--remain to be convinced. 
  The threat of a paralysis of the European institutions may 
be 
even more difficult to avert. "Already, with 16 member states, 
just going around the table will take at least 3 hours," an 
adviser to Edouard Balladur emphasizes. In order to work with 20 
states, the Europeans will be unable to limit themselves to 
remedies that are merely cosmetic. The entire complex of 
decision-making mechanisms will have to be revised, but the 
expansion now under way has already given rise to disputes over 
the respective powers of the large and the small countries. 
Strengthening the authority of the European Commission would 
inevitably complicate the problem. 
  Aware of the difficulties, the Twelve would rather push back 
the deadlines. To be sure, initiatives designed to prepare for 
the rapprochement are being presented. The Commission has given 
the former Socialist minister of agriculture, Henri Nallet, the 
task of preparing a report on the Common Agricultural Policy 
vis-a-vis the countries of the East. The Phare aid program 
should undergo a lifting [preceding word in English] and be 
endowed with a mechanism for investment and training. It is also 
a matter of associating--in the near future--the countries of 
the East with certain common policies on energy, communications, 
transportation, and the environment. The real difficulties, 
however, will not be attacked until 1996, the date of the 
intergovernmental conference that is on the Maastricht calendar. 
Preoccupied with the applications of the Scandinavian countries 
and Austria, the Twelve are--for the present--satisfied to take 
temporary expedients. 
  The final difficulty is the security problem. Desirous of 
joining NATO, the countries of East Europe have had to be 
patient and accept the concept of Partnership for Peace, for 
want of anything better. Disappointed, these countries are 
turning toward Europe in the hope of obtaining a place within 
the Western European Union (WEU), the future military wing of 
West Europe. "No responsible government is ready to accept their 
total admission to the WEU," is the off-the-record comment at 
the Quai d'Orsay. Explanation: the WEU provides for automatic 
intervention in the event of aggression against one of its 
members. Are the French or the Italians ready to die for Riga? 
By way of a response, the Twelve are suggesting to the countries 
of the East that they accept the status of WEU "associates." It 
is a symbolic decision that imposes no obligation. Still another 
European initiative is the conference on stability that will be 
held in Paris from 26 to 27 May. It will bring together the 
foreign ministers from East Europe and the Baltic states, with 
the intention of promoting good-neighborly relations among them. 
According to one of Edouard Balladur's advisers, the conference 
should be the occasion for a strong political signal, provided 
it is followed by negotiations. In the final analysis, however, 
West Europe's responses with respect to security do not meet the 
East's expectations. 
  "We will of course participate in all the initiatives that 
the Union sends our way," a Polish diplomat comments, "but what 
we want are guarantees." In other words, what they want are the 
rules of the game, and a timetable. 
  West Europe coolly calculates that the negotiations for WEU 
membership cannot begin before the end of the century. "We 
backed into the East European case," says Jean Pisani-Ferry, 
director of the Center for International Public Opinion and 
Information Research (CEPII). "There is a lack of imagination 
and a lack of political will," adds the East Europe expert 
Jacques Rupnik, who is disturbed at the wave of disillusion 
currently sweeping over these countries. 
  The proposal that the Community has made to the countries of 
East Europe to the effect that they strengthen their mutual ties 
within a framework of regional cooperation cannot satisfy them; 
they are afraid not only of forming a new CEMA [Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance] but also of creating a purgatory 
that would indefinitely delay their entry into the EU. Given 
these commercial, financial, and political constraints, could 
Europe move any more rapidly? No, its leaders reply, for they 
seem to believe they have all the time in the world to take 
action. By burying their heads in the sand, however, the Twelve 
risk being overtaken by history and forced to make agonizing 
reappraisals without having had time to prepare for them. 
<H5>  [Box, p 65] </H5>
<H5>  Reciprocal Trade in Textiles </H5>
  East Europe's share of the West European clothing market 
rose 
to 13.3 percent in 1992 from 8.8 percent in 1989. France's trade 
balance with the East in the clothing sector continues to show a 
large deficit (of more than 1.5 billion francs [Fr] in 1992), 
but this deficit is partially compensated by our favorable trade 
balance of more than Fr500 million in the sector of textile 
products that are used in the manufacture of clothing. 
  This phenomenon is the same in all of the countries of West 
Europe, because in order to profit from the reduced customs 
duties the East European manufacturers must in practice use EU 
textiles. 
  Georges Jolles, president of the Union of Textile 
Industries, 
is also not overly worried. "In our view," he says, "it is a 
less serious threat than that posed by the Asian countries. We 
will suffer if these [East European] countries do not genuinely 
open their markets, but if they do, the relocations will be a 
positive factor and will enable us to sell more products that 
have a high added value." 
<H5>  [Box, p 66] </H5>
<H5>  Brussels Redoubles Its Vigilance With Respect to Steel </H5>
  The customs barriers against the steel products of the East 
European countries will come down in 1996. The entry of these 
new suppliers into a market that is increasingly open disturbs 
those Community steel producers who are fully involved in 
restructuring. Trade in steel has benefited the East European 
countries, inasmuch as their trade surplus rose from 382 million 
ecus in 1988 to 817 million in 1992. 
  The competitive prices of these countries are frightening. 
"How can they justify steel prices that are 30 percent below 
those of the market?" asks Francis Mer, the PDG [CEO] of 
Usinor-Sacilor. Mer says the real costs of production 
(transportation, energy, and raw materials) are not factored 
into the price of their steel. 
  Brussels has not remained insensitive to the calls for help 
from its steelmakers, and penalties were assessed in 1992 
against steel from Czechoslovakia. For even though customs 
duties are being lowered, the Community has recourse to clauses 
that provide safeguards--and antidumping clauses--with which to 
defend itself. Above all, however, it is the volumes of trade 
involved that should reassure the steel producers, for only 4 
percent of all steel imported by the Twelve comes from the East 
European countries.

  [Excerpt] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres arrived in 
Vienna on an unofficial visit Tuesday [14 June]. The highlight 
of a short meeting with [Chancellor Franz] Vranitzky was Peres' 
statement: "We have no problems at all with Austria, relations 
could not be any better." It was not always like that, and it 
might become different with Italy. However, regarding questions 
in this connection Peres said that Prime Minister Berlusconi and 
Foreign Minister Martino were great friends of Israel. As far 
as the neofascist government members are concerned, one would 
have to wait and see. Peres appeared to be as optimistic as 
ever about the progress in the peace process, even though a 
severe controversy about Jerusalem flared up in the past few 
days. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Against Contempt for Democracy"] </F>
  [Text] The motto of the meeting of the Social Democratic 
Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Council in Vienna, "There is 
much at stake, Austria is at stake," is no coincidence. One 
week after the referendum on European Union membership, the SPOe 
wants to use the impetus of the European elections for the 
forthcoming Nationalrat election campaign. In his speech which 
lasted almost one hour, SPOe Chairman Vranitzky yesterday 
reminded the 300 delegates that the issue "on 9 October" is 
"approval for a course of economic prosperity and social 
security." And addressing Haider: "The SPOe intends to turn 
its election movement into a large-scale campaign against the 
new edition of contempt for democracy." 
  The SPOe chairman did not leave any doubt that he wants to 
continue bearing the coalition partner in the government. With 
the unanimous adoption of the electoral program (150,000 
additional jobs) and the list of candidates, the course was set 
to bring this about. Vranitzky himself is the top candidate on 
the federal list and also on the Vienna [provincial] ticket. 
The SPOe top candidate in Burgenland is Health Minister 
Krammer, in Carinthia Deputy Anton Leikam, in Lower Austria 
Social Affairs Minister Hesoun, in Upper Austria SPOe Economic 
Spokesman Nowotny, in Salzburg SPOe Deputy Harald Hofmann, in 
Styria Heidrun Silhavy, in Tirol Walter Guggenberger, in 
Vorarlberg SPOe Federal Councilor Herbert Boesch. Banker Rene 
Alfons Haider is also running for the Nationalrat: on the 
promising 25th place of the SPOe's federal ticket.

the Social Democratic Party, by Christoph Kotanko in Vienna; 
date not given: "I Represent Austria in Accordance With the 
Rules of the European Union"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kotanko] Mr. Chairman, 
Nationalrat elections will be held in about four months. What 
is your goal for the elections? Do you want to become so strong 
that you no longer depend on the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] 
as the junior partner? 
  [Vranitzky] Such a goal must always exist. Of course, one's 
sense of reality sets certain limits. We have a coalition 
agreement with the OeVP, which is valid until the last day of 
the legislative period. Anything else must be discussed after 
the elections. 
  [Kotanko] Have the Greens become more predictable, more 
serious for you as a result of their changed attitude toward the 
European Union [EU] membership treaty? 
  [Vranitzky] I admire people like Johannes Voggenhuber, who, 
despite their anti-EU conviction, accept the clear decision of 
the people after the referendum as Voggenhuber did [he said that 
he will vote for the EU membership treaty in parliament as a 
result of the positive referendum]. However, that does not yet 
build any bridge for a future coalition. [passage omitted] 
  [Kotanko] Many people expect a "duel" between Vranitzky and 
Haider in the election campaign. The Freedom Party chairman 
wants to gather the "real patriots" around himself. 
  [Vranitzky] I believe there is a difference between "real 
patriots" and patriots. And, after all, Haider does not look so 
glorious now, after the referendum. He has suffered an enormous 
defeat and then called this a climax..

<F P=106> [Report by Magdalena Rauscher: "Haider's All-Out Attack in </F>
`the Thin Air'"] 
  [Text] The beginning of the election campaign a la Joerg 
Haider: Overflowing with self-confidence and cynicism, he 
started an all-out attack against political opponents and 
critics from within his own ranks at the Freedom Party of 
Austria [FPOe] federal congress in Linz. 
  The aftermath of the defeat in the European Union [EU] 
referendum was severe. Haider's criticism of the declared EU 
advocates in his party was veiled but unmistakable. During the 
FPOe's "steep climb to a fascinating summit" the air has already 
become thin and "some" people's "hearts have started to flutter 
and they are afraid" as a result. However, the FPOe does not 
need fearful persons and egotistical functionaries. 
  Erwin Hirnschall, a president of the Vienna provincial 
legislature, who had celebrated together with the 
Industrialists' Association on the evening of the referendum, 
received verbal slaps from Haider and the secretary generals -- 
which he returned during the discussion in the afternoon. 
Hirnschall: A continuing massive anti-EU course is a 
"dangerous path" for the FPOe. 
  Back to Joerg Haider: He does not see any EU advocates 
anymore. The people are "not pleased" about this vote. 
  Political opponents were showered with verbal abuse: The 
Social Democratic Party of Austria has left a "heap of 
sociopolitical shards" with its policy. The Austrian People's 
Party [OeVP] is "degrading its own president." He even called 
OeVP Chairman Busek a "self-styled coalition idiot." 
  When the chairman was elected in the evening, Haider's 
unambiguous call for cohesiveness showed effect: He was the 
only candidate and was reelected with 96.6 percent of the 
delegates' votes. Following his own proposal, he now has five 
deputies: Edith Haller (80.2 percent); Hans Achatz (81.8 
percent); Karl Schnell (86.5 percent); Michael Schmid (86.9 
percent); Susanne Riess (78 percent). 
  An interesting aside: Haider asked Erwin Hirnschall to chair 
the election campaign-- "because he brings me luck."

<F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Attacks Before the FPOe Congress"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna/Linz -- Just in time before the beginning of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] congress, with which Joerg 
Haider wants to take the offensive again, new accusations 
against the FPOe chairman were disseminated on Friday [17 June]. 
Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Federal Manager Josef 
Cap quoted from an article in the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU which 
accuses Haider of contacts with a group that is classified as 
right-wing extremist in the FRG. 
  U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli -- the Democratic 
representative from New Jersey is the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee and involved in human rights issues -- has 
warned his 434 colleagues in the House of Representatives 
against meeting with FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider. In a 
memorandum Torricelli pointed out that Haider had praised the 
employment policy of the Third Reich. He should "not be honored 
by a visit to Congress." 
  Haider did not comment on this matter. FPOe officials are 
surprised that a visit to Congress is supposed to be prevented, 
which Haider neither intended nor had asked for. Rather, his 
visit to the United States next week is aimed at meeting 
Austrians living abroad in New York and talks with U.S. foreign 
policy experts about a potential Austrian membership in NATO. 
  This goal of the FPOe is to become both the topic of the 
party congress and the central issue in the election campaign, 
FPOe Secretary General Karl-Heinz Grasser told DER STANDARD. 
The congress, at which Haider wants to propose one or two new 
deputies, should also engage "a bit in coming to terms with the 
past." He will mention Erwin Hirnschall's "behavior that was 
damaging to the party." Hirnschall had rejected Haider's offer 
to present his arguments in favor of EU membership during 
Haider's own appearances and had, instead, criticized the party 
line in the "Press Hour" television program.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Vienna: 5.7 Kg Enriched Uranium </F>
Discovered"] 
  [Excerpt] In a search of the home of 39-year-old Croatian 
Ilja M., on Museumstrasse in Vienna's Neubau district on 
Wednesday [15 June] morning, police discovered 5.7 kg of 
enriched uranium in metallic form -- in three pieces. Alfons 
Burtscher, of the Seibersdorf Nuclear Research Center, who 
examined the metal, said that this material is usually used for 
containers for radioactive substances, yet after extended 
radiation with neutrons in nuclear power plants one might even 
extract small quantities of plutonium from it. In the form in 
which the uranium was found, it did not pose any danger to the 
neighborhood. Burtscher said that the radiation was 10 millirem 
per hour. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Triads From China and Mafia Members </F>
From the Balkans"] 
  [Text] The Russians do not have a monopoly. In China and 
Hong Kong, too, there are Mafia-like structures -- the so-called 
triads. They are primarily organizing the smuggling of people. 
  How the gigantic profits are invested was cautiously 
indicated by Interior Minister Loeschnak in his book 
People From Abroad, Refugees, Expellees, Guest 
Workers: 
  "At the moment 346 Chinese restaurants are registered in the 
trade register in Vienna alone.... Even though I do not 
overestimate these findings and know that there are many `good' 
Chinese, the security authorities are of the opinion that these 
Chinese restaurants form the pillars of a dynamic, rigidly 
organized, perfectly and professionally working, cohesive 
system." 
  The Chinese do figure prominently in money laundering and 
these restaurants are excellently suited for that purpose. 
  Money laundering always works where there is a large and 
sophisticated network of restaurants. 
  Just like Turkish-Kurdish organizations, the Chinese triads 
also benefit from the extortion of protection money. 
  Over the past few months criminals from the former 
Yugoslavia 
have repeatedly come under the heading of "mafia." The 
expression "Yugo Mafia" is, however, exaggerated, Josef Dick, an 
official of the Interior Ministry, says. "Even though there is 
organized crime, there is no large network of gangs in the 
background, such as in Russia or China." Over the past years the 
"Yugo Mafia" has primarily attracted attention because of its 
activities in connection with the acquisition of weapons, but it 
also earns money with prostitution. Almost the entire scene 
red-light district of Vienna is in its hands.

<F P=106> [Report signed O. Al. and E.S.: "Belgian Navy Will Be </F>
Commanded by a Netherlander"] 
  [Text] Efficiency: That is the objective of the "close 
cooperation" agreement between the Belgian Naval Force and the 
Netherlands Royal Navy which Belgian Defense Minister Leo 
Delcroix is due to sign on 30 June with Ter Beek, his 
Netherlands counterpart. This project is likely to produce some 
irritation in Belgium. Indeed, although the two Naval Forces 
should prove more efficient by the implementation of this 
agreement, some people will not fail to regret the organization 
of this binational force. 
  Contrary to the methods used in the Eurocorps for instance, 
(a rotating command among the countries involved), the 
Netherlands, according to the Naval Force internal memorandum 
which LE SOIR has been able to procure, will permanently hold 
the operational command. The Benelux admiral will see his 
responsibilities extended in peacetime to operations outside 
Belgian-Netherlands territorial waters. The Belgian rear 
admiral would always be the deputy and the replacement for his 
Netherlands colleague. Indeed, this is an extension of a 1951 
agreement which makes provision for giving command to the 
Netherlands in time of war. 
  However, the Belgian ships could, under Belgian operational 
command, participate in national missions, or even international 
missions. 
  The agreement should also make it more difficult to carry 
out 
another drastic reduction in Belgian and Netherlands naval 
staffing levels, which have been subjected to stringent 
reduction plans in recent years. 
  The memorandum also takes up some points which will be 
consolidated. For instance, there will be no question of one of 
the two partners in the Belgian-Netherlands force specializing 
in one sector or another. Each of the forces will as far as 
possible maintain a "general" role. The ships will also 
continue to be based at the same home port. Thus, although the 
joint headquarters will be based in Den Helder, in the 
Netherlands, the ships currently based at Zeebrugge or in 
another Belgian port will remain there. 
  In the logistical sphere, the "close cooperation" will 
relate 
to the maintenance of ships and equipment, and a joint purchase 
and acquisitions policy. And, finally, there will be a 
harmonization of new construction programs. In this sphere, 
Belgian-Netherlands cooperation has just met with a failure: 
The Netherlanders have refused to participate in the program to 
develop new Belgian minesweepers. 
  The Belgian Naval Force will also be able to maintain its 
relations with other navies, as it is currently doing with the 
French National Navy, which maintains the weapon systems on 
Belgian frigates. 
  Finally, the agreement makes provision for the bilingualism 
of the Belgian Naval Force to be maintained. It therefore 
remains for the Netherlands admiral to prove that he knows more 
French than the motto of the Netherlands royal family: "I will 
uphold."

  [Text] Representative of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
in Brussels have called on Rwandans to mobilize against France. 
The call, he said, concerns Rwandans in the country as well as 
those throughout the world. Mobilize to defeat the French 
treason plan, Jacques Bihozagara -- who is a member of the RPF's 
political desk -- said. You have to live or die in Rwanda, and 
nowhere else, he said. Today, I quote, France, completing its 
plan, is flying to the aid of the executioners in their 
desperate plight. 
  The RPF delegate also warned those African countries which 
might be tempted to take part in the French-led intervention, 
and called on the international community not to be accomplice 
to a project over which it was not consulted.

Jacques Santer To Form a New Government -- Santer Will Poll This 
Afternoon the DP and LSAP Before the CSV National Assembly 
Tonight Decides Which Coalition Partner Will Be Selected -- 
Coalition Negotiations Will Start on Saturday"] 
  [Excerpt] As expected, the Grand Duke yesterday (Tuesday) 
appointed Prime Minister Jacques Santer, who had tendered his 
resignation, to form a new government. This decision, which was 
made around 4 PM [1400 GMT] during an audience in the Villa 
Vauban [residence of the Grand Duke], had been preceded in the 
morning and in the afternoon by separate consultative 
discussions between the Grand Duke and the party chairmen Ben 
Fayot (LSAP) [Socialist Workers' Party of Luxembourg], Charles 
Goerens (DP) [Democratic Party], and Robert Mehlen (ADR) [Action 
Committee for Democracy and Pension Fairness], and with Jup 
Weber (GLEI-GAP) [Green Ecologist Initiative List/The Green 
Alternative]. 
  This very afternoon Jacques Santer is holding exploratory 
talks first with the DP and then with the LSAP. Early this 
evening he will then convene the expanded CSV [Christian Social 
People's Party] national council in the metropolitan "Carrefour" 
(Convict Center) in order to decide which of the two parties is 
to be invited to enter into coalition negotiations. On Friday 
[17 June], the day after tomorrow, the Prime Minister will 
submit an interim report on the development to the Grand Duke, 
after which the actual coalition negotiations could start as 
early as Saturday. Despite certain timetable obligations on the 
part of various government members, these could be pushed ahead 
swiftly and brought to a conclusion towards the middle of July.

With the LSAP Following the Parliamentary Elections on 12 June

  [Excerpts] After nearly three hours of consultations at an

conference center], the national council of the Christian Social 
People's Party (CSV) resolved yesterday evening, with an 
overwhelming majority (there were only two abstentions, made for

  Tomorrow, Friday [17 June], Prime Minister Jacques Santer,

the political development following the elections on 12 June, 
after which the first coalition negotiations are likely to take 
place as early as Saturday morning, the day after tomorrow. 
They will be conducted swiftly and completed toward the middle 
of July. To this end, and in order to prevent any delays, 
working groups are to be used to deal with various matters if no 
ordinary meetings can take place next week because of the 
national holiday in Luxembourg and the European summit meeting 
on 24 and 25 June on the island of Corfu in which both Prime 
Minister Jacques Santer and Foreign Minister Jacques Poos will 
take part. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham and Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Excerpt] The murder of six men in a village pub by 
loyalist terrorists was condemned as "inhuman savagery" by 
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew today. 
  He pledged the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] would never 
give up their hunt for the masked killers who struck last night 
as customers at O'Toole's Bar in the hamlet of Loughinisland in 
Down Patrick, Northern Ireland, watched the Irish team in their 
winning opening match against Italy in the World Cup on the pub 
television. 
  Sir Patrick said that in their grief and horror he offered 
all his sympathy to the families of the dead and injured and 
"denounce the inhuman savagery and injustice of this act. The 
moral squalor of those who perpetrated it is beyond description." 
  The cheering stopped suddenly mid-way through the second 
half 
to be turned to screams of terror and pain when two killers from 
the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force burst in and opened fire 
indiscriminately. 
  They opened fire and kept firing into the crowd of 24 packed 
into the tiny pub. Five men died instantly, another a short 
time later in hospital. All were Catholics. 
  Among five men injured in the shooting one was today 
critically ill. The four others were described as ill. 
  Sir Patrick said he had faith the Province was going to put 
behind it "the foul madness and sectarian murder perpetrated by 
so few. One thing is certain: it will achieve no political 
purpose, no concession, no blackmailer's reward no matter how 
long it continues. Let this revolting massacre now, therefore, 
mark the end of it from whatever quarter." 
  He appealed to anyone who knew anything, or suspected 
anything, to help the police catch the murderers. [passage

  [Text] Britain protested strongly today over the detention 
of up to 50 aid workers, including some Britons, in a 
strife-torn region of Angola. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said the relief workers had been 
detained at Huambo, in the country's central highlands, since 
Wednesday [15 June] by UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebels. 
  He was unable to say how many British charity workers were 
being refused permission to leave the UNITA stronghold but said 
there was no evidence that any had been harmed. 
  "We have registered our strong concern and protest to the 
UNITA delegation in Lusaka," he added. "We view any restriction 
on non-governmental organisation's freedom of movement very 
seriously and would want UNITA's assurance that it would be 
guaranteed." 
  Angola's state-run daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, said 
UNITA had been holding 56 aid workers but "in unclear 
circumstances." 
  But UNITA spokesman Jorges Valentim, quoted by Reuter in the 
Zambian capital, Lusaka, denied any involvement and said 
continued bombardments in the Huambo area had left people 
stranded. 
  He said Aranda da Silva, head of the United nations 
humanitarian unit in Angola, had travelled to Huambo with eight 
other aid workers on Wednesday without telling UNITA leaders. 
  Valentim said they had run into "complications" which led to 
the eight aid workers being left behind along with others who 
had been due to be picked up at Huambo. 
  The Foreign Office said the workers were employed on 
humanitarian relief missions in the area and the Government was 
hoping for a swift response from UNITA. 
  Reuter quoted aid director Philippe Borel, in Angola, as 
saying: "The situation is extremely, extremely tense, confusing 
and difficult."

British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, with whom he discussed 
the latest developments in the Cyprus issue following UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report. The meeting 
took place in Oxford, Hurd's electoral district, where the 
British foreign secretary was handling other business. 
  Speaking after the meeting, Mikhailidhis said that the two 
ministers exchanged views on the issue of the promotion of the 
confidence-building measures and on new developments following 
the latest Butrus-Ghali report. They also exchanged more 
general views on what the next steps should be. The foreign 
minister said he stressed that Cyprus will not participate in a 
dialogue to amend the 12 March document. Mikhailidhis also said 
that he briefed the British foreign secretary on the Cyprus 
Government's belief that there must be a new approach to the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis also said that during the 
meeting they discussed Cyprus' membership in the European Union 
[EU], as it will be considered during the upcoming EU Summit in 
Corfu. Mikhailidhis described his meeting with Hurd as very 
useful. The foreign minister will return to Cyprus this evening 
via Athens.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Countries in crisis such as Iran, 
Iraq, Syria, and Libya are trying to build up their arms 
stockpiles with nuclear, biological, and chemical [NBC] weapons 
by the extensive use of agents. Information from the German 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution obtained by the 
Cologne EXPRESS newspaper (Sunday [19 June] edition) reveals 
they are increasingly trying to obtain "sensitive" goods 
necessary for the production of NBC weapons. 
  The documents say that employees of the former Soviet KGB 
secret service have expanded the range of their spying 
activities in Germany. The goal is not to acquire know-how but 
to exert direct influence on firms and associations. Eastern 
secret services have also increased their activity through 
former Stasi agents who have not yet been detected.

  [Excerpt] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl has warned Germany against going its own way in Europe and 
the world. Faced with future security challenges, it will be in 
Germany's interest in the 21st century to continue its policy of 
Western ties and international integration, the chancellor said 
today while accepting this year's Konrad Adenauer Prize from the 
Germany Foundation in Munich. This also means that Germany 
should not stand aside when tasks and operations aimed at 
preserving and reestablishing peace in Europe and the world are 
at issue. 
  Hence, the issue of the Bundeswehr's deployment is at the 
heart of united Germany's future alliance and partnership 
capability, Kohl added. Anyone opposing bloodshed should also 
help prevent or end it. If Germany fails in this, then it is 
"justifiably" losing international respect and its own dignity, 
but also the confidence that it needs and on which it depends to 
a greater extent than do other countries. "A people no longer 
willing to work with its partners for peace and freedom has also 
morally given up," the head of government said. 
  Kohl once again emphasized the significance of Europe's 
political union for safeguarding peace. Nobody should believe 
that the specter of nationalism in Europe is endemic only to the 
Balkans. On the other hand, Germans should also resist the 
temptation to despise patriotism just because that notion was 
abused during the Nazi period. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["afk" report: "Laender Finance Ministers Determined To </F>
Save Money"] 
  [Text] Dresden, 17 Jun -- At their annual conference in 
Dresden on Friday [17 June] the finance ministers of the laender 
stated that they are willing to save money. At the same time 
they called on the Federal Government to stay "lastingly and 
clearly" below the growth rate of 3 percent in the coming years, 
which was recently recommended by the Financial Planning 
Council. The laender are willing to stick to the limitation of 
3 percent. 
  As Brandenburg Finance Minister Kuehbacher (Social 
Democratic 
Party of Germany) said, when new laws that are linked with 
expenditures are adopted, the Federal Government must also 
consider where the money needed can be saved. Kuehbacher cited 
as an example the new insolvency law for the benefit of 
consumers, which entails considerable costs for the judiciary. 
The figure of 3 percent is also to be understood as a guideline 
for the wage negotiations. Despite the will for saving, the 
ministers estimate that the deficit of the old laender -- 
because of the new regulation for the redistribution of 
financial means and the predicted losses in tax revenues -- will 
amount to about 30 billion German marks [DM] in 1995, thus being 
higher than ever. Next year almost one out of five marks from 
tax revenues will be spent on paying interests. Therefore, it is 
necessary to reduce the state's tasks, to reduce the number of 
personnel, and to conclude wage contracts, which are oriented 
toward the growth rates. The communities cannot expect any 
further help or easing of their burdens. Because of the 
recession, tax revenues will remain lower for years longer than 
it was expected last year. Saxony's Finance Minister Milbradt 
said that this and next year the losses in tax revenues will 
amount to about DM10 billion. The ministers rejected a tax 
increase beyond what has already been decided. A decision about 
proposals for a profound tax reform in 1996 has been postponed 
to November. 
  The ministers called on the Federal Government to make sure 
in the European Union [EU] "that the German net contribution is 
again reduced to a level appropriate in relationship with the 
net contributions by the other member states." Doubling the 
German net contribution between 1990 and 1992 to about DM22 
billion is in gross contradiction to the reduced capacity of the 
united Germany and poses an additional burden on the public 
budgets. The Federal Government must urge strict budget 
discipline in the EU, reject the desires for loans by the EU 
Commission, which are aimed at "circumventing budget 
discipline," and channel more structural subsidy funds to 
Germany. The ministers advocated the view that a revision of 
the EU's system of contributions, "including the question of 
discounts on contributions," should be initiated "as soon as 
possible," if these efforts do not bring about a sufficient 
reduction of Germany's net contributions.

<F P=106> ["bue" report: "Bonn's Wishes for European Agricultural </F>
Policy"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 Jun -- The Federal Government intends 
to use its presidency in the European Union [EU] Agriculture 
Ministers' Council during the second half of 1994 to simplify 
European agricultural policy and to create larger regional 
leeway for the implementation of the agricultural reform. This 
is the precondition for greater acceptance by farmers and 
administrations, a memorandum presented by FRG Agricultural 
Minister Jochen Borchert in Brussels says. In addition, it is 
difficult to make the detailed provisions for implementation 
compatible with the principles of subsidiarity and 
reasonableness. The memorandum adds to the German 
recommendations of April 1993, some of which have already been 
taken up by the Council of Ministers. Borchert stresses that he 
is not striving for a "reform of the reform." 
  In addition to technical and administrative simplification, 
his 10-point list includes, however, also various changes of 
substance. Thus, Bonn is advocating the abolition of the 
limitation of premiums for feeder cattle to the first 90 animals 
of an enterprise. The premium, which has been paid in two 
installments so far, is to be paid as a one-time lump sum in the 
future and is to be raised accordingly. In addition, the quotas 
for individual companies regarding the premiums for breeding 
suckling cows and sheep should be replaced with regional upper 
limits. Bonn's initiative promises success only if the European 
Commission adopts the German ideas and presents corresponding 
proposals for changes to the Council of Ministers. However, the 
Commission is skeptical about Germany's wishes, because it fears 
a renewed expansion of production and greater problems with 
checking the figures for subsidies.

<F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Stihl Demands Tax Reform and New </F>
Social System"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 16 Jun -- In the coming legislative term, 
Germany as a business location will need a new tax reform, as 
well as privatizations, deregulation, and a restructuring of the 
social security system, the president of the Federation of 
German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], Hans Peter 
Stihl, told Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a meeting of the 
German foreign trade chambers in Bonn. 
  Stihl praised the chancellor for showing, over the past few 
years, how important he considers Germany's foreign trade 
interests, not least during his visits abroad. Stihl said he 
sees no point in calling for more state involvement in times of 
difficult economic conditions, but he expects politics not to 
make life unnecessarily difficult for industry. This should 
start at home. Good framework conditions in Germany are the 
best promotion of foreign trade, the DIHT president said. 
  The FRG has made good progress in this respect lately. The 
economy is gradually recovering. This is partly due to the 
corporation tax reform, this year's moderate wage agreements, 
and the enormous amount of rationalization and restructuring 
carried out by companies. Yet, one must not forget that Germany 
as a business location has to cope with permanent structural 
challenges, Stihl said, directing his words in Kohl's direction. 
  In Stihl's view, markets will interlink at an increasing 
speed due to the enlargement of the European Union [EU] and the 
successful conclusion of GATT. It is important now that GATT is 
put into practice as quickly as possible. Free world trade must 
not be threatened by new criteria, such as environment and 
social standards. 
  In front of the 700 participants of the DIHT event entitled 
"Out of Dullness, Fit for the World Market" Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl called on the EU to conduct an internationally open 
trade policy and advocated basic international employees' 
protection rights to be more widely observed. This must, 
however, not serve as a pretext for new protectionism, the 
chancellor added. Increasing integration of the Central and 
East European states in the big market of the European Economic 
Area is a foreign-policy aim of the German EU presidency that 
starts on 1 July 1994. 
  Kohl decisively rejected calls for direct export and 
investment subsidies. In the chancellor's view, protectionism 
and trade barriers in view of ever increasing international 
competition are short-sighted measures. First, free world trade 
is essential for an export-oriented country such as Germany, and 
second, an upswing of the economies of Germany's eastern 
neighbors means political stability and an insurance against 
relapses and old contrasts, Kohl said. 
  Stihl announced that German industry will open new 
delegates' 
offices in Shanghai, Singapore, and Hanoi. The Warsaw and 
Ankara offices are to be upgraded to Foreign Trade Chambers.

<F P=106> ["cr"-signed report: "Specialists for Joint Ventures"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 16 Jun -- The Federal Government wants to 
start a joint training initiative together with the People's 
Republic of China. At the first German-Chinese conference for 
medium-size companies in Bonn, where more than 200 German and 
Chinese firms discussed possibilities of improved industrial 
cooperation, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that Bonn's 
offer aims at "making the successful German training system also 
available to the Chinese partners." 
  Speaking to Beijing Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Shi 
Guangsheng, Rexrodt expressed his interest in introducing the 
dual system in fields where it could prove particularly 
effective in connection with German joint ventures. The 
combined training in schools and industry is to bring about 
skilled workers for the joint ventures with Germany. The major 
part of this program shall be funded by the German Financial 
Cooperation Program with China. The proposal is expected to be 
finalized when Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng visits Bonn at the 
beginning of July. 
  Rexrodt said it is no coincidence that China is of 
particular 
importance for Germany in political, cultural, and economic 
terms. For German industry China is the biggest market for 
investment goods in East Asia and the biggest trading partner 
among the developing countries worldwide. Last year, trade 
between Germany and China amounted to 24 billion German marks. 
At the same time, Rexrodt warned against further Chinese trade 
balance surpluses in the billion marks range. This calls for 
new ways of increasing companies' capital and financial powers. 
  The government in Bonn wants to expand cooperation with 
China 
as "a trustworthy, reliable, and economically important 
partner." Medium-size companies are expected to play a major 
role in this. Yet Rexrodt demanded that the Chinese Government 
provides favorable framework conditions. Beijing could give 
fresh impetus to the German economy via fiscal policy, Rexrodt 
said. 
  Rexrodt's reference to an upcoming simplification of laws 
and 
regulations in Germany in the current legislative term was an 
unmistakable hint to the Chinese. This would strengthen 
medium-size companies. Rexrodt voiced satisfaction with the 
growing globalization of medium-size German companies and 
pointed out that the opening of markets in order to create new 
fields of activity is an important task of politics. In this 
context, Bonn advocates China joining the GATT and the future 
World Trade Organization, which the Federal Government wants to 
be based in Bonn. 
  To intensify German-Chinese cooperation among medium-size 
firms, the Federal Government has raised funds for sending a 
delegate of German industry to Shanghai. He will be 
particularly concerned with making contacts with medium-size 
firms from the growth regions of Shanghai/Pudong and the Yangtze 
Delta. At the moment, medium-size companies already do nearly 
half of all business with China. But the number of 400 German 
projects in China can certainly be increased. 
  A precondition for a stronger capital transfer to China is 
state guarantees for German foreign investment. That is why the 
Hermes credit guarantees should be used by medium-size companies 
in particular, Rexrodt said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian physicist Anatoliy Dyakov, head of </F>
the Moscow Center for Arms Controls, Energy, and Environment, by 
Andrzej Rybak; place and date not given: "Nonsense!"] 
  [Text] [Rybak] Six grams of plutonium 239, used in nuclear 
weapons, has been seized in Germany. Might it have come from a 
Russian military arsenal? 
  [Dyakov] That cannot be ruled out. But controls over 
radioactive components in Russian military nuclear facilities 
are still quite stringent. The quantities of plutonium that 
have appeared on the black market and can be used in weapons are 
very small. No one can make a bomb out of that. 
  [Rybak] Can plutonium for use in weapons be obtained during 
the process of dismantling warheads? 
  [Dyakov] Russia destroyed some 2,000 warheads last year. 
This took place under strict supervision. 
  [Rybak] In that case, where are the loopholes? The theft 
and smuggling of radioactive substances is reaching frightening 
proportions! 
  [Dyakov] The situation is fully under control in all the 
facilities under the authority of the Nuclear Ministry. But 
because the wages of most employees are not enough to subsist 
on, many of them try to earn extra money. Unfortunately, one 
way of doing that is by stealing and selling radioactive 
substances. 
  [Rybak] Can one not control the handling of these substances 
more stringently? 
  [Dyakov] That is very difficult. Noone knows exactly how 
much plutonium and uranium are produced in civilian reactors. 
That does not apply only to Russia. In the entire world there 
are no exact figures, just estimates. 
  [Rybak] Weapons-grade plutonium is still being produced in 
Russia. When will the military reactors be shut down? 
  [Dyakov] Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in three 
reactors in Russia. The press claims that they will be closed 
down this year. That is nonsense. These reactors also produce 
electricity and provide heating for the neighboring cities of 
Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk. Only when there is an alternative can 
they be shut down. That is out of the question before the year 
2000. But we are prepared to place under intentional control 
every gram of plutonium we produce. The relevant document has 
already been drafted. 
  [Rybak] Could the West offer more effective help? 
  [Dyakov] The Americans have already promised us lots of 
money just to dismantle the warheads. Now they want to provide 
us with gas-fueled power stations in exchange for the shutdown 
of the nuclear ones. I am skeptical about that, because so far 
we have only received a smidgen of this loudly proclaimed 
assistance.

as the leading political force in Saxony, it received fewer 
votes at the municipal and district elections, as well as at the 
district and town council elections of cities that do not form

result, the CDU received 38.1 percent of the votes, compared to 
44.6 percent in 1990. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS], and Alliance 90/Greens registered a 
clear increase in votes. The SPD received 21.6 percent of the 
vote (14.7 percent in 1990), the PDS 16.3 percent (11.6 percent 
in 1990), and Alliance 90/Greens 7.7 percent (4.5 percent in 
1990). The Free Democratic Party received 7.5 percent of the 
votes, compared to 6.3 percent in 1990, With 0.1 percent of the

<F P=106> ["UR" report: "Scharping Accuses Kohl of Cheating Voters"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has condemned the Federal Government's 
renunciation of a tax concept for the next election period as an 
"attempt to cheat the voters on a large scale." The Federal 
Government must explain to the public and to the Bundestag why 
it does that, he said in Bonn's SPD Press Service on Friday [17 
June]. After all, the tax concept was announced in January in 
the government's annual economic report, which is an official 
document. 
  Scharping sees primarily one reason for the renunciation: 
"Chancellor Kohl does not have the courage to tell the people 
that the government coalition is planning considerable tax 
increases." It has obviously already been decided that the tax 
lie of the previous Bundestag election will be repeated, 
Scharping asserted. 
  Even after the debacle at the European elections, SPD 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping does not want to change anything about 
the program and the basic line of the election campaign. A few 
days before the election party congress in Halle (22 June) he 
announced that the SPD will "increase mobilization, make the 
will for a change clearer, and improve its reform profile." The 
election of the candidate for the chancellor's office is to be a 
secret ballot. "I do not want an acclamation." 
  Even though he pointed out that he is not responsible for 
every poster, Scharping admitted that he shares responsibility 
for mistakes. Thus, the western German way of thinking was 
transferred to the east, where it was not understood. He 
himself "has done clearly too much during the past half year; 
concentration is slipping." 
  Scharping still sees a chance to win the Bundestag 
elections. 
Yesterday Sharping did "not" want to "discuss publicly" 
personnel reshuffles in the election campaign team and in the 
party apparatus. He did not confirm Federal Manager Guenter 
Verheugen's announcement that the shadow cabinet will be 
presented at the end of July. Instead, he gave the second half 
of August as the date. 
  The focal issue of the congress in Halle, which was 
deliberately scheduled immediately before the Landtag elections 
in Saxony-Anhalt, is the election program with 230 motions for 
amendments. Guest speakers are new DGB [German Trade Union 
Federation] Chairman Dieter Schulte as well as the prime 
ministers of Spain and Norway, Gonzalez and Brundtland.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Mafia Gangs Are Founding an </F>
Increasing Number of Cover Firms"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- According to findings by German 
security authorities, the number of cover firms that are 
operated by international criminal organizations to cover up 
illegal activities is rising in Germany. These include, among 
others, import and export companies, travel agencies, bus 
companies, restaurants, trucking companies, used-car dealers, 
leather goods and textile shops, as well as foodstuffs and fish 
wholesale companies. 
  In their investigations police discover the establishment of 
business structures in almost one out of two cases of organized 
crime. Security experts say: "Legal business structures are 
the ideal foundation for illegal deals, including money 
laundering." 
  This is particularly true for drug trafficking: Thus, last 
year authorities noticed, for instance, that one cartel was 
selling its drugs via a "pizza service." Orders by telephone -- 
under cover names -- were filled promptly. The Italian Camorra 
prefers leather shops run by straw men to service the German 
drug market. To camouflage heroin transports from Turkey, 
Kurdish dealers are using travel agencies, companies producing 
car bodies, trucking companies, and bus companies. However, an 
"advertising company" founded in South America has also been 
used for cocaine deals. 
  Original ideas to cover up its varied and highly criminal 
activities were used by a gang of pimps, who expanded their 
commercial empire by a "security company." 
  Over the past months authorities have noticed increasing 
boldness among organizations for smuggling people, which have 
established virtual "bus passenger services." Smuggling tours 
are declared to the border authorities as "tourist trips" or 
"transports of guest workers." In the FRG it is primarily 
restaurants, laundries, cultural associations, or temples that 
are used as contact points for the man-traders. 
  Popular logistical bases for car smuggling gangs are car 
workshops and used-car companies. So as not to attract the 
attention of the authorities, the provisions of the Trade 
Inspection Office are followed and plausible tax statements are 
presented.

<F P=106> ["hal"-attributed report: "Law on Construction of </F>
Rapid-Transit Link Passed"] 
  [Text] With the votes of the coalition, the Bundestag has 
passed a planning law for the magnetic levitation vehicle link. 
It was necessary to pass this law to begin construction of the 
already agreed upon "Transrapid" magnetic levitation vehicle 
link between Hamburg and Berlin. The opposition and the 
environmental organizations have criticized this rapid-transit 
link as superfluous from the point of view of communications and 
environmentally hostile. Therefore it is doubtful whether the 
Bundesrat, in which the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
has a majority, will vote for the planning law. Transportation 
Minister Wissmann (Christian-Democratic Union) described the new 
link as a future-orientated transportation system that is an 
effective contribution to the problem of solving increasing 
transportation needs in an environmentally friendly manner. The 
construction of the first stretch of the magnetic levitation 
link is essential primarily to secure export chances of the 
technology involved. On the other hand, the SPD criticized not 
just the magnetic link itself, but the planning methods used. 
SPD Bundestag deputy Wetzel said the planning law is full of 
inconsistencies, and that citizens did not play an adequate part 
in the planning process. The construction of the magnetic link 
is to cost 8.9 billion German marks [DM], with the federation 
contributing DM5.6 billion to the construction of the route. 
The finished link is to be run on a private basis by the German 
Federal Railroad and Lufthansa, and is to be completed by 2005.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt 
(Free Democratic Party) believes that buoyant forces are 
increasingly gaining the upper hand in the German economy. 
Introducing the monthly economic report, Rexrodt said in Bonn 
today that the economic revival is strengthening in western 
Germany. With growth of 2.1 percent, the GDP in the first 
quarter of 1994 has for the first time in a year surpassed last 
year's figure. Around half the loss in overall production which 
occured during the preceding recession was made up as a result 
of the latest increase. In general, a further strengthening of 
the upward trend in the west can be expected. 
  The rate of recovery in the eastern states is particularly 
strong in industry. Thus, incoming orders in the manufacturing 
industry in the first quarter are nearly 20 percent higher than 
last year. The construction industry is also expanding rapidly. 
According to the ministry, orders in the construction industry 
exceeded last year's results by 31 percent in the first quarter 
of 1994. 
  The consequences of the recession on the labor market in the 
west are still in evidence. In general, however, unemployment 
seems to have bottomed out, said Rexrodt. Seasonally adjusted, 
the decline in employment and rise in unemployment has slowed 
down noticeably.

<F P=106> [`fk' report: "Bundesbank Issues Statement on Interest </F>
Rates"] 
  [Text] With its interest rates policy, the Bundesbank sees 
itself caught in a trap between the improving stability on the 
economic front on the one hand and the unsteady developments in 
the financial sector on the other hand. With the latest 
reductions in the discount and Lombard rates, "the interest 
rates horizon should be clear for the time being," according to 
the Bank. 
  "Unlike in the United States, the climb in the value of 
German securities does not reflect any definite inflation 
trends," says the Bundesbank's June report. "Foreign confidence 
in the stability of the mark remains unbroken. This is also 
visible on foreign currency markets, in which the mark even 
managed to gain in value against the dollar for a short time." 
  The Bundesbank attributes the rise in German long-term 
interest rates over the past few months to the financial vortex 
coming from the United States. In the meantime, short-term 
interest rates are sinking. On account of the closer link 
between interest rates in recent years, worldwide uncertainties 
have materialized in the form of a "high-risk premium" for 
long-term investments. 
  Bundesbank President Tietmayer is confident that a credible 
financial policy, supported by a financial and wages policy, 
"will eventually serve to overcome any unjustified rise in 
long-term interest rates," although the Bundesbank report also 
says that the interest on capital sums, which sank to as little 
as 5.5 percent at the beginning of the year, was underestimated. 
  The unexpectedly strong drop in interest rates on 13 May, 
involving a fall in the discount rate from 5 to 4.5 percent and 
a fall in the Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6 percent, was "quite 
compatible with the concept of money quantity control," 
according to the Bundesbank. 
  According to the June report, the strong increase in the 
amount of money in circulation over the past few months (a 
15.4-percent increase on an annual scale) has resulted in a 
great reluctance to save money over a longer term. But the 
latest drop in interest rates should encourage people to keep 
less cash on hand and create more savings, says the Bundesbank. 
  Between January and April, total capital sums amounted to a 
mere 40.8 billion marks [DM], so that the increase in 
medium-term investments amounted to 6.5 percent between these 
months, representing a 4 percent increase on an annual scale. 
The total value of savings certificates in the nonbanking 
sector fell by DM15.8 billion, while fixed-term savings plans 
valid for more than four years received strong subsidies (DM22.9 
billion). 
  The increase in credits between January and April was far 
greater than last year, DM65.9 billion compared to DM45.7 
billion. The Bundesbank attributed this increased demand for 
credits to forthcoming reductions in tax concessions for 
property. Nevertheless borrowers, fearful of higher long-term 
interest rates, still tried to secure more favorable terms.

<F P=106> ["df"-signed report: "German Fiscal Policy Is on the Right </F>
Track"] 
  [Text] Dusseldorf, 16 Jun -- In its monthly report for 
June 1994, the Bundesbank indicates that fiscal policy is on the 
right track. Significant progress has been achieved in the 
consolidation of public funds. Yet, this progress has mainly 
resulted from an increase in taxes and rates, which is quite 
problematic, considering that the burden is already extremely 
high by international standards. 
  A strict expenditure regime is absolutely necessary to 
reduce 
the public share in the national product and the tax and rate 
burden. The growth rate of public expenditure should come to 
remain below the normal rate of increase of the GNP. 
  The Bundesbank expects the 1995 expenditure ratio to be some 
45 percent of the GNP, compared with 42.5 percent in 1989, and 
40.5 percent in 1990, the year of the tax reform. The framework 
conditions for economic growth require that the tax and rate 
burden be gradually reduced again in the future. Taxation of 
companies will be of particular importance in this process, the 
Bundesbank report says. 
  In the view of the Bundesbank, the 1994 deficits of local 
authorities will be roughly the same as in 1993 (some 135 
billion German marks [DM]). Although the economic trough is 
expected to be overcome soon, the tax yield will remain modest 
at an expected increase of 5 percent. Without the increase in 
petroleum tax, which will finance the railroad reform, the 
growth in tax revenues would be just under 4 percent. This 
forecast is based on the assumption that in 1994 the German GNP 
will increase by 1.5 percent in real terms, and by 4 percent in 
nominal terms. 
  The 1994 deficit of the local authorities will also include 
the expected DM6 billion deficit of the newly established 
federal railroad structure, but it does not include the Trust 
Agency deficit, which will reach DM44 billion. The local 
authorities' net credit requirement for 1994, including that of 
the Trust Agency, will be some DM175 billion, which is 5.5 
percent of the GNP. 
  The 1995 tax revenue estimation is based on the assumption 
that the German GNP will grow by 4.5 percent in real, and 2.5 
percent in nominal terms. Compared with a previous estimate of 
May 1993, which had expected 6-percent and 3-percent growth 
rates, the 1995 tax estimate has had to be lowered by DM21 
billion. 
  The Bundesbank says: "Since the new projection mainly 
adjusts costs downwards, and not so much expectations of real 
growth, this does not have such a big impact on the state's 
fiscal situation as might be suspected at a first glance at the 
new tax estimation." 
  As the Trust Agency in its present form will cease to exist 
at the end of 1994, the enormous Trust Agency deficits will no 
longer be included. "In this comprehensive view, the coming 
year might see a considerable step towards consolidation," with 
all its consequences, including those of slowing down the growth 
of money supply. 
  The national pension insurance is expected to achieve a 
DM4-billion deficit in 1994, which would be only half the 1993 
figure. For funding, the pension insurance can fall back on its 
fluctuation reserves, which will have reduced to DM31 billion by 
the end of 1994. A west-east transfer of some DM13 billion is 
expected within the pension insurance in 1994. 
  The financial situation of the Federal Employment Office is 
slowly beginning to improve, although there is still a high 
deficit. In 1994 the Federal Employment Office will face a gap 
of some DM18 billion, which will have to be filled by government 
funds. In terms of the federal budget, this means that the 
burden will ease by DM6.5 billion compared with last year. 
West-east transfer in this field is DM15 billion.

<F P=106> ["bsc" report: "Economic Development in Eastern Germany </F>
Tangibly Recovering"] 
  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- In the view of the Bundesbank, 
the economic development in eastern Germany is tangibly 
recovering. In particular the processing industry has recovered 
-- by 21.5 percent during the first quarter compared with the 
same period last year. In its monthly report for June the 
Bundesbank assesses this as a sign of the increasing 
competitiveness of eastern German products -- but only on the 
domestic market for the time being. There, however, orders by 
German customers have risen by 26.5 percent within a year, 
because foreign business has not yet been able to find a 
replacement for the losses on the markets in East Europe: The 
share of export business in overall turnover has shrunk to about 
10 percent. 
  According to the Bundesbank, the construction sector remains 
an essential factor of economic recovery: Not only in the 
public and industrial sector but also in housing construction 
has there been a strong expansion in building activities. At 
the moment, new buildings are also being ordered in increasing 
numbers, in addition to the improvement and renovation of 
apartments. 
  The guardians of the currency see a glimmer of hope for the 
working people: Despite the still "alarmingly high" 
unemployment of 1.16 million people at the end of May, the 
reduction of personnel in the processing industry has come to a 
standstill. However, apart from structural problems, a "wage 
policy that is little appropriate for the actual conditions" has 
so far worsened employment prospects, the Bundesbank notes 
reproachfully. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Helmut Maier-Mannhart: "From First to Second </F>
Gear"] 
  [Text] The economic recovery during the first quarter of 
this year was stronger than generally expected. The increase of 
the GDP by 2.1 percent compared with the same period last year 
in western Germany was the first increase in the annual 
comparison since 1992. However, this result needs to be 
interpreted, because it could easily lead to incorrect 
conclusions. Of course, following the deep valley of recession 
of 1993, such a figure is primarily good news, because it makes 
clear that the recovery has intensified and has gained ground. 
The danger of a relapse, which was hanging over the German 
economy like the sword of Damocles for the past months, may now 
be considered finally banished. 
  However, things get problematic if one takes the growth rate 
at face value and even extrapolates it, because there is no 
doubt that it exaggerates the actual development. This is 
primarily due to the fact that this 2.1 percent refers to an 
extremely low statistical base. During the first quarter of 
1993 the recession had reached its absolute low point. This 
means that, for instance, the corresponding rate for the second 
quarter will be considerably lower, because during the 
comparable period last year the economic development had already 
stabilized a bit. By the way, the development of the GDP also 
shows that the recovery is progressing a bit more slowly. 
Compared with the fourth quarter of 1993, the overall output of 
the German economy during the first quarter increased only by a 
moderate 0.5 percent. 
  However, this does not change anything about the fact that 
one may revise the forecast for the entire year 1994 slightly 
upward against the background of the figures of the quarter. 
The Ifo Institute has just done that; the economic researchers 
from Munich now expect an increase of the real GDP in the west 
by 1.5 to 2 percent in contrast to the 1.5 percent mentioned in 
the spring report of the research institutes. In the new 
laender, where the institute expects a strong increase of 
investments to 160 million German marks [DM], an overall 
economic growth of at least 7.5 percent is considered possible. 
However, here, too, it is important that the considerably 
better result this year will form the platform for a further 
growth next year, which could then reach 3 percent or perhaps 
even a bit more. 
  Unfortunately, all this has hardly any effect on the labor 
market. According to Ifo, the number of unemployed in the west 
will once again grow by 300,000 to 2.6 million on annual average 
this year; in the east it will probably go up by another 50,000. 
The current decline in May to 2.5 million (west) and 1.15 
million (east) is largely seasonal; practically no stimuli by 
the economic development are felt as yet. 
  And what does this growth process consist of? The main 
elements still come from abroad. This is shown, first, in the 
foreign trade balance, where goods exports skyrocketed to DM61.2 
billion in March (February DM50.7 billion). Even though imports 
also increased strongly -- to DM53.8 billion following 44.9 
billion -- the surplus in foreign trade rose to DM7.4 billion 
(previous month DM5.8 billion). The order statistic, too, still 
shows an excess in foreign orders. In the two-month comparison 
of March/April with January/February orders in the processing 
industry rose by an average of 6 percent. Germany contributed 
an increase by 5 percent to this and other countries an increase 
by 8 percent. However, the April figures indicate that the wind 
might be changing. In April orders increased by 0.6 percent 
compared with the previous month, whereby domestic orders were 2 
percent higher and foreign orders declined by 1.5 percent. 
Still, such a monthly result is not yet a guarantee that 
domestic orders are recovering, but it would certainly 
correspond to the usual pattern of the economic development if 
the export orders, which have increased for quite some time, 
would soon give rise to more orders also at home. As a result 
of the increasing number of orders received, industry has 
switched to the next higher gear in output. In April output 
rose by 2.5 percent compared with May and by 4.1 percent 
compared with last year. 
  There are two circumstances that are irritating at the 
threshold to the economic summer. First, the companies' 
inclination toward investments is still not very high and, 
second, interest rates have been rising for some months. An Ifo 
poll has shown that industry is planning a nominal plus in 
investments of only 0.5 percent, which probably means a real 
minus of about 2 percent. This reflects the fact that the 
companies still have considerable reserves in capacity and that 
one still needs a certain time in upswing before investments in 
expansions are ordered. As regards private consumption, on the 
other hand, it has developed far better than predicted. While 
one rather had to expect a decline because of the declining real 
income as a result of higher taxes, private consumption rose by 
1 percent during the first quarter of 1994 compared with the 
last quarter of 1993. This shows that the citizens want to 
maintain their standard of living even if incomes go down and 
that they rather accept a declining savings quota instead. 
However, in April retail trade suffered a virtual slump with a 
decline of 9 percent. Nevertheless, there is the prevalent 
opinion that, even though private consumption will not be able 
to make a contribution to the upswing in this period, it will, 
on the other hand, at least not cause any damage to the economic 
development. 
<H5>  Interest Risks </H5>
  In contrast, the rise in the capital market interest rate to 
more than 7 percent now does not quite fit the situation. The 
economic development has by far not reached a stage at which it 
would be appropriate to make long-term money, which is essential 
for investments, more expensive. This is all the less so since 
the development of prices over the previous months has led 
downward; in April the inflation rate was 2.9 percent, thus 
being below the 3- percent mark for the first time in three 
years. Certainly, the interest rate is still below the long-term 
average, but the signal given by the rising interest rate is 
problematical. Even though the Bundesbank is doing everything 
possible to push short-term interest rates downward, one can see 
once again that its arm is not long enough to reach the end. 
  Despite all assumptions to the contrary, it is obviously not 
possible to decouple the development of the capital market in 
Germany from that in the United States. When the interest rate 
is still at least 0.5 percent higher and keeps rising, this is 
certainly appropriate to the situation in view of the U.S. 
economic development, which is in full swing. In our country, 
however, this could brake the upswing, which would be anything 
but desirable in the coming months. 
  What applies to Germany also applies to the international 
economy as a whole: The recession has been overcome, but 
climbing out of the valley is difficult. The only exception is 
the United States, where the economy is currently growing at an 
annual rate of 5 percent. Japan, on the other hand, still has 
difficulties. The high exchange rate of the yen is an enormous 
brake on the recovery, the domestic programs for stimulation 
have not yet had an effect. Therefore, a considerable increase 
of the GDP is expected only for next year. In West Europe, 
Great Britain and Norway are the pacemakers of the economic 
development. In total, the HWWA [Hamburg Archive for World 
Economy] expects an increase in the GDP of the West European 
states by 1.5 percent, with accelerating growth during the 
second half of the year. In 1994 the volume of international 
trade will probably rise by 5 to 6 percent and thus reach 
approximately the speed of expansion it had during the second 
half of the 1980's.

<F P=106> [Report by Jutta Roitsch: "DGB Demands Signal From Kohl </F>
Even Before the Election"] 
  [Excerpts] Berlin, 16 Jun -- The Federation of German 
Trade Unions [DGB] Congress in Berlin on Thursday [16 June] 
noted that its trade unions are determined to practice 
solidarity with the unemployed. The trade unions promise "that 
one of the focal points in wage policy will be the fairer 
distribution of available work." In return, they have demanded 
from the Federal Government a "program for economic impulses" 
even before the Bundestag election in October. 
  "When it is true that there is enough work in this society, 
then it has to be organized," Hermann Rappe, chairman of the IG 
Chemie, the trade union of the chemical industry, said by way of 
explaining a notice of motion. Then it must be decided how and 
where the work is done and how this work should be paid. The 
Federal Government must show its determination to do something 
against mass unemployment this year. "If it does not, if there 
is no initiative to fight unemployment, then the trade unions 
can call for political change," Rappe, who is also a Bundestag 
deputy for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], said. 
  The employment signal which the DGB expects from the Kohl 
government also includes, among other things, that public 
investments, particularly in the spheres of transport, 
environment, and energy, be made earlier than planned. [passage 
omitted] 
  A premiere, which was much applauded by the delegates, took 
place on Wednesday afternoon. The DGB Congress was for the 
first time addressed by a spokesman for the Alliance 90. Ludger 
Volmer praised the "productive relationship between closeness 
and distance" and said that he was hoping that talks would 
continue under the new DGB chairman. One of the last 
politicians to convey a greetings message on Thursday afternoon 
was Gregor Gysi, of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]; 
when he took the floor, the delegates of the IG Chemie left the 
room in protest. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Postal Companies Act Against Warning </F>
Strikes"] 
  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main, 17 Jun -- Negotiations in 
connection with the conflict over wages for postal employees 
continued in Cologne on Friday [17 June] at noon. According to 
the German Post Trade Union, the issue to be discussed in 
Cologne primarily was the adjustment of income and old-age 
pensions for postal employees in eastern Germany. The talks 
were accompanied by mutual accusations of the parties to the 
wage negotiations and by warning strikes of the employees in 
many cities. 
  On Friday morning about 8,000 employees went on strike in 63 
post offices and 44 telephone offices. As a result, the postal 
companies applied for injunctions against the warning strikes. 
Mr. Goerts, the chief negotiator of the employers, issued a 
statement saying that, by doing this, the postal companies are 
acting in the interests of their customers. "In particular now, 
during the vacations, thousands of applications for visas, 
airplane tickets, and other documents are stuck at the post 
offices." 
  In a letter to Mr. Van Haaren, the chairman of the Post 
Trade 
Union, Post Minister Boetsch pointed out on Wednesday that the 
backlogs created by the strikes in the postal services have 
risen to 63 million letters. The trade union strikes have 
reached a scope that cannot be described with the term "warning 
strike" anymore. He, Boetsch, and "other people not directly 
involved" get the impression that the Post Trade Union is 
pursuing the wage negotiations "not in the usual way, that is, 
not oriented toward results and goals." Boetsch met with Van 
Haaren in Berlin late Thursday evening. 
  Goerts announced that the companies have suffered damage 
running into three-digit million sums. Many customers are 
defecting to the private competition. Goerts accused the Post 
Trade Union of continuing its "political strikes" despite the 
latest rapprochement. Over the past days good results have been 
achieved regarding the integration and the protection of east 
German employees against dismissal. 
  Mr. Heidorn, the chief negotiator of the Post Trade Union, 
accused the employers in Cologne of pursuing "political 
negotiations." By delaying and protracting the negotiations 
they want to postpone the talks until the planned decision about 
the postal reform in the Bundestag on 29 June. The trade union 
will think about extending the warning strikes. The prospects 
for coming to an agreement at the negotiations in Cologne on the 
weekend are "zero," Heidorn added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "A Future for Kim"] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt that Jimmy Carter is the 
appropriate man to support the cause of his late successor, 
current President Bill Clinton. His spectacular meeting with 
North Korea's dictator Kim Il-song, however, gives rise to 
questions about Washington's inner workings, about the "Friends 
of Bill" ("FOBs") in Clinton's White House. 
  First: Did Carter travel without a mandate as a private 
scout or did he have an assignment to mediate if he were 
successful? And second: What role does the current President 
play in U.S. foreign policy, among whose most urgent tasks today 
is coping with the North Korean challenge with covert or 
simulated nuclear armament? Does Clinton prefer being 
represented by his congenial predecessor in difficult situations 
over being represented by his secretary of state? 
  The use of high-ranking unofficial emissaries, in particular 
of the "elder statesmen," is a trick of high-level politics. 
Again and again they are stepping onto the international stage 
when it is necessary to signal interest in an arrangement or to 
get involved. Carter has a reputation as the protector of peace 
between Israel and Egypt. 
  During the Gulf conflict in 1990, he went to Iraq without 
George Bush's approval to personally ask Saddam Husayn to 
release his hostages, just as Brandt, Waldheim, and Heath did. 
At that time, Carter and his colleagues rather contributed to 
confusion and, with his trip to Baghdad, Carter confirmed the 
Iraqi dictator's intention to refuse to withdraw from Kuwait. 
  Undertakings such as the latest talks serve to satisfy the 
needs for prestige of those who rule by force, to preserve face 
for withdrawing from untenable positions -- but also to 
gradually lift the international isolation of an opponent. In 
any case, however, they are useful for not letting former 
statesmen be forgotten. Kim Il-song, too, may see a future for 
himself -- perhaps offering his good services to Baghdad or 
Tripoli?

  [Text] Regarding the French proposal to intervene in 
Rwanda, Paris is still awaiting the backing of the UN Security 
Council. A draft resolution is to be presented next week to the 
United Nations. This morning, President Francois Mitterrand 
spoke in Paris at a UNESCO conference. He supported the idea of 
French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. The French 
president said the situation requires urgent measures, even if 
the United Nations does not give its blessing to the operation: 
  [Begin Mitterrand recording] We can no longer wait. Everyone 
can see that. There remain a few hospitals, churches, some 
sites where not everyone has been massacred. It is therefore 
the extreme urgency of the situation which pressed Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe to say that without waiting for the arrival 
of the UN force, France, together with those of its European or 
African partners who might be willing to help, is prepared to 
send a humanitarian protection force aimed at ensuring the 
security of the civilian population which has so far avoided 
extermination. 
  This is being organized, it is now a matter of hours or 
days. 
This is the point we have reached. I must say that two or three 
African countries have replied positively, and we are still 
waiting for firm responses from European countries. Whatever 
happens, we'll do it. I repeat: every hour counts. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick de Saint-Exupery: "French Initiative </F>
Breaks Lethargy"] 
  [Text] [Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe has dared to take the 
first step. For the first time since 1945, a Western country 
has recognized, through the mouth of its foreign minister, the 
existence of a "right to intervene" in the case of genocide. 
  Until now, one intervened "charitably," more to placate 
public opinion troubled by the images of the world's misfortunes 
on its TV screens than in the name of a "moral and political" 
imperative. But in calling publicly for such a step, Alain 
Juppe has broken a taboo and encouraged a number of states which 
were until now too pusillanimous. Belgium's Defense Minister 
Leo Delcroix welcomed the initiative, which "breaks the 
lethargy" of the international community. 
  Among Alain Juppe's entourage, nobody is hiding the fact 
that 
this decision was made rapidly. It is also admitted that media 
pressure played a major role. "It is obvious," a senior official 
from the French Foreign Ministry recognized, "that last 
Saturday's [11 June] massacre of 160 orphans acted as a 
catalyst. It was too much!" Finally, one does not hide away 
when certain observers accuse France of seeking to "make good 
past mistakes." As the same official commented: "We were slow 
in reacting, but does that mean we should do nothing?" 
<H5>  Many Questions </H5>
  Now it is time for action, or rather reaction. Because it is 
very late. The massacres began on 6 April. Reports and eye 
witness accounts flowed in. Unanimous conclusion: A genocide 
was under way and, far from hiding away, those responsible for 
this monstrous act were claiming credit for it. 
  The silence of the different states became deafening and had 
to be broken. This has been done. But, in practical terms, 
this does not resolve anything. Moving from symbol to action 
raises a host of questions. 
  First of all, about the form. Like Francois Mitterrand 
traveling to Sarajevo without warning his European counterparts, 
Alain Juppe moved ahead without consulting his partners. UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali was warned by telephone, 
but Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the 
Italians...were all caught off guard. London, Brussels, and 
Washington appear to reluctant to the initiative. Only the 
Italians and Spaniards appear to be ready to consider action 
with the French, who have become veritable "snipers," according 
to one of Juppe's close colleagues. 
  With regard to substance: The French Government is starting 
out with a severe handicap, due to its blind support, since 
1990, of a now totally discredited regime. A senior diplomat 
summed it up: "We have to get the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
to understand that we are not against it. We have no intention 
of intervening to stay. We are looking to push forward a 
reconciliation initiative." 
  This is where the ambiguity lies. How far is Paris ready to 
go in the name of "reconciliation?" Is it ready to discuss with 
those responsible for the "genocide," or should it distance 
itself from the former regime in order to construct the future 
with the few moderates, Hutus and Tutsis alike, who have managed 
to escape the massacre? 
  Despite its precipitousness, Alain Juppe's initiative 
represents a deliberate political choice. The time limit which 
the foreign minister has given himself before deciding, if 
necessary, on a purely French intervention, will therefore be 
very short. His entourage is specific: "In a few days, a week 
perhaps, if nothing has moved forward from an international 
viewpoint, a decision will be made." 
  Alain Juppe is playing for high stakes. Africa, too, whose 
leaders this time have been able to merit Western interest in 
its fate. A few days ago, Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary 
general of the Organization for African Unity (OAU), recognized 
at the Tunis summit that "the tragic lesson we have to learn 
from events in Rwanda is that Africa must prepare to assume its 
responsibilities. We need to have the courage to criticize our 
mistakes."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe by </F>
correspondent Claire Chazal, in Paris -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Chazal] Good evening, Mr. Juppe. You returned 
less than an hour ago from Africa. Can you tell us whether you 
think the United Nations Security Council will vote on Tuesday 
[21 June]? 
  [Juppe] [break in transmission]...oppose such an initiative. 
I am confident about the first stage in establishing this 
difficult and dangerous operation. 
  [Chazal] In any case, France cannot go it alone? 
  [Juppe] To stress the humanitarian and international nature 
of this operation we hope to go in with others. You were saying 
that I have just come back from Africa: I visited Cote d'Ivoire 
and then Senegal. Senegalese President Diouf confirmed that he 
was ready to establish a contingent of Senegalese troops 
alongside the French ones. 
  The unanimous reaction among African countries--I managed to 
see all our ambassadors in the region--is favorable. We are 
finding support on that principle among European countries. I 
hope that in the next few days we will manage to convince our 
partners to join with us. 
  [Chazal] Could France go in even if no other European or 
western country went in with her? 
  [Juppe] We hope that other European countries will come with 
us. Italy has said that it will put itself at our disposal. In 
the next few hours or days we shall exercise our diplomatic 
activity to try to convince those who recognize that something 
has to be done--the pictures we have just seen demonstrate 
this--and that France, of course, cannot do everything by itself. 
  [Chazal] Concretely, once the decision has been taken, how 
long will it take to send the troops, and how many men can be 
sent there? 
  [Juppe] I am sure you will understand that I will not give 
you details of a number of issues: how many men, or what the 
procedures will be, for an operation which, even its aim is 
exclusively humanitarian, is an operation which is putting 
soldiers' lives at risk. A certain amount of discretion is 
needed. So all this will be arranged if the resolution is 
passed on 21 June, or 22 June at the latest, and if we manage to 
get our various partners to move, I think things can move very 
fast, sometime next week. 
  I would like to stress that we are making a lot of effort to 
convince the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] that the operation is 
not directed against them. This week we shall have contacts 
with the Rwandan prime minister appointed by the Arusha accords, 
in other words the one recognized by everyone. We also have 
contacts on the ground--the person we have just seen, Mr. 
Larome--who heads the crisis unit of the Foreign Ministry, is on 
the ground, to try to get our humanitarian aid through. We 
shall also have contacts in New York, and again in Paris, with 
RPF officials. 
  [Chazal] If France sends soldiers to Rwanda, those troops 
will likely have a difficult mission. The rebels on the ground 
are hostile to the arrival of French troops. They accuse France 
of having helped the regime of President Habyarimana--who was 
assassinated on 6 April--for four years. [passage omitted] 
  [Chazal] Mr. Juppe, it is true that this mission appears 
particularly difficult in this context. 
  [Juppe] It is difficult, but I am astonished to see the 
number of lies you can read in the press about what has happened 
over the past few years. France is blamed for having supported 
President Habyarimana, as if he were responsible for what is 
happening today. I would like to remind you of a simple fact: he 
is dead. He was assassinated. Now we have the extremists, whom 
he was actually holding back, and on whom he had managed to 
impose the Arusha accord of July 1993--which was welcomed by 
everyone as an accord for reconciliation including by the RPF; 
it was thanks to him that this was done. 
  I think that this way of assuming the worst about France, 
accusing it of being responsible, directly or indirectly, for 
what is happening, is intolerable, and has nothing to do with 
reality. 
  [Chazal] Is it too late to intervene now, several months 
after the beginning of this terrible crisis? Could we have done 
it earlier, or have demanded this intervention before? 
  [Juppe] First of all, throughout 1993, as I have just said, 
we gradually brought about the reconciliation process of July 
1993. Then there were French troops preparing for the arrival of 
the RPF in Kigali to join the government--this has been 
forgotten. This all seemed to be working. Reconciliation was 
under way, power was being shared out. This assassination 
happened about two months ago and threw everything into turmoil. 
We reacted immediately with humanitarian aid, trying to get a 
cease-fire brought about by the major states of the region, and 
asking the United Nations to bring a force of 5,500 men. What 
did we see? That nothing happened. That the cease-fire was not 
respected, that the UN force was not coming. It was at that 
point that we said to ourselves: We can't go on waiting for 
these decisions to be implemented, France must set an example. 
  People are saying it is too late. Who has done it before us? 
Who today is claiming to move faster than us? Not many people 
in the international arena.

  [Excerpts] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has said 
that between 1,000 and 2,000 soldiers would be needed to carry 
out a French humanitarian operation in Rwanda. [passage 
omitted] Alain Juppe was interviewed in the Ivorian capital by 
Jean-Karim Fall: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] We have said very clearly that our 
intervention should be given the green light by the United 
Nations. We are examining the type of UN resolution that could 
give a mandate to member states to intervene to save the 
population, which is the prime concern. 
  Several European countries that we have contacted have told 
us, some publicly, that they approve of the principle of the 
operation. I spoke to my Italian, Spanish and British 
colleagues, and other contacts have been made in Paris. Several 
African countries have also expressed their support in 
principle. We are now examining the concrete modalities of the 
operation, the duration of which should be limited; it should 
have precise objectives and should be exclusively humanitarian. 
The aim is to save people who might be killed within the next 
few days. The operation should be carried out by several 
countries. To avoid any ambiguity, France does not wish to go 
it alone. 
  [Fall] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] is opposed to any 
French presence in Rwanda. Could this mollify your 
determination to intervene? 
  [Juppe] No. This does change our determination, but we would 
like to convince the RPF of our intentions. I understand that 
some extremists want to solve the problem through a complete 
military victory. This will solve nothing. One day a 
reconciliation process to share power will have to be reached, 
enabling Hutus and Tutsis to live together in Rwanda. France 
tried to obtain this kind of settlement, most notably through 
the Arusha Agreement. 
  We will continue our contacts with RPF officials. I would 
like to stress that we obtained their agreement to let a 
humanitarian convoy through to Kigali; 30 tonnes are on the way. 
I believe that it is possible to explain better what we are 
doing. 
  [Fall] You told the daily LIBERATION that you are in favor 
of 
judging those responsible for this genocide. Are you in favor 
of an international tribunal? 
  [Juppe] Yes. Such a tribunal will probably have to be set 
up. It is out of the question to reinstate extremists with so 
much blood on their hands when we sit around a table in an 
attempt to find a peace agreement. They will have to be 
identified and punished. 
  [Fall] Many observers consider that Hutu extremists started 
this genocide. Do you share this view? 
  [Juppe] It is indisputable that the day after president 
Habyarimana -- who was able to maintain a balance for years, who 
agreed to the Arusha process -- died, extremists from his camp, 
militias, initiated massacres which I myself called genocide, in 
the proper sense of the word, namely: To exterminate a 
population on the ground of its ethnic characteristics. There 
is not any doubt about this. Massacres by the other side took 
place when the RPF troops advanced: This is also obvious. 
  [Fall] You also said in LIBERATION that French policy in 
Rwanda had not always be faultless. On which precise point do 
you believe that France made mistakes? 
  [Juppe] Who can pretend to be infallible? Rather than stress 
mistakes I would rather stress what we have attempted to do in 
Rwanda. I will gladly mention it, since this process was partly 
initiated before April 1993. As I said earlier, our aim was 
reconciliation and power-sharing. [passage omitted] 
  I cannot accept the accusation of bias or of France's 
support 
for one side against the other. This is not what happened. I 
repeat that what we tried to do was to help the population -- 
who will have to cohabitate one day or another -- live together.

  [Excerpts] The situation in Rwanda has mobilized the French 
authorities. [passage omitted] France has called for a meeting 
of the UN Security Council in order to set up a humanitarian 
mission. This mission has just been confirmed, following a 
meeting at the Prime Minister's Office, which was attended by 
Edouard Balladur. In Kigali, the rebels have once again 
expressed their hostility to any French military intervention. 
Arnaud Lapeyre takes stock of the situation: 
  [Lapeyre] [passage omitted] France already has troops in the 
Central African Republic. These troops could be carrying out a 
mission in Rwanda very soon, but this intervention would only 
take place within a specific framework. Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard comments: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] Two things are ruled out: First 
and foremost, for us to go there on our own, and second, for us 
to be there for a long time. There are two prerequisites: We 
must have a mandate from the international community and we must 
be helped by other countries, including African countries. [end

  [Excerpts] France is putting the final touches to its plan 
for humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  French efforts to explain the plan do not seem to be finding 
much response among the Rwandans. The prime minister appointed 
by the Arusha accord, Faustin Twagiramungu, wonders why France 
wants to intervene in Rwanda. He is against this intervention. 
Assane Diop contacted Mr. Twagiramungu by phone in Montreal: 
  [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] My position is very clear. 
I imagine it is the same as that of most Rwandans. Given the 
involvement of France in the Rwandan conflict since 1990 up 
until the signing of the peace accord, France should not 
intervene, even if the resolution is presented to the UN 
Security Council. 
  Second, you yourself know that the second UNAMIR [UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda] now exists, in accordance with UN 
Resolution No. 9-18. This resolution should be implemented. 
  What we might rather ask of France is to supply the 
logistical material so that the 5,500 troops that have been 
agreed on can (?come) to Rwanda. 
  [Diop] In other words, even if the United Nations votes for 
the French resolution to send 1,000 French troops, you will not 
accept a physical presence of French troops? 
  [Twagiramungu] No, indeed. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] A Belgian newspaper, LE SOIR, revealed that the 
dual assassination of the presidents of Burundi and Rwanda, 
which was behind the unleashing of violence in Rwanda, was 
carried out by two members of the French armed forces who are 
reported to have shot down the plane carrying the two heads of 
state as they were landing in Kigali on 6 April. 
  There was an immediate denial from French Cooperation 
Minister Roussin and from the Foreign Ministry. The Belgian 
journalist who reported this is with us live from Brussels: 
  Good afternoon, Colette Braeckmann, can you confirm what you 
wrote in your paper this morning, in other words that, although 
you are using the conditional tense, you have good reason to 
believe, according to your information, that it was indeed two 
French soldiers who carried out this dual assassination? 
  [Braeckmann] Yes, a source which I consider to be a credible 
one, which comes from Kigali and which groups together other 
pieces of news in my possession, establishes that it was two 
Europeans, two French nationals, who fired the missile which 
shot down President Habyarimana's plane. What I do not know is 
within what framework they may have acted. 
  [Announcer] Here you are saying two Europeans, but in your 
paper it said two French soldiers. Was it two Europeans, or two 
French soldiers? 
  [Braeckmann] Two French soldiers, but I do not know within 
what framework they may have acted. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] As you can imagine, this is a serious accusation 
which is categorically denied in France. How did they act? 
According to the accounts you have heard, they fired a missile 
didn't they? 
  [Braeckmann] Yes, according to all the eyewitness accounts, 
two rockets were fired, shooting down the Rwandan president's 
plane. The precision of this rocket fire was such that all the 
sources assure me that the Rwandan military did not have the 
necessary technical training to carry out this kind of operation 
with such success. 
  [Announcer] How can one be sure that not a single Rwandan 
soldier could use such weapons? 
  [Braeckmann] The source comes from...[Braeckmann pauses] 
military cooperation assistants and experts in the Rwandan army 
have given assurances that it is virtually out of the question 
for a member of the Rwandan Armed Forces to have been able to 
carry out this kind of operation and that specialists of another 
country must have been called on to do it. 
  [Announcer] It is perhaps a delicate matter for you as a 
journalist, but I must ask nevertheless: Are these sources which 
are all in agreement with one another, to which you refer, 
really serious sources, in your opinion? 
  [Braeckmann] They are serious, and I cannot say more about 
the source, which comes from Kigali, because as you know the 
situation is dangerous out there and people's lives are not 
worth much. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Belgian newspaper LE SOIR wrote this morning 
that President Habyarimana's aircraft might have been shot down 
on 6 April by two French soldiers wearing Belgian uniforms and 
acting on behalf of Hutu extremists. Belgian officials 
immediately said that this possibility had been rejected by 
their investigation committee. French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe, currently visiting Abidjan, brushed aside these 
accusations: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] From what I gather, the author used 
the conditional tense in his article. He reports allegations 
according to which the French were wearing Belgian uniforms, and 
so forth. I shall not expand further. According to my 
information this seems to be pure fabrication. I have no more 
comments to make. An investigation under the aegis of the UN 
secretary-general is currently underway to establish the truth. 
All these rumors are obviously baseless. I regret that such 
accusations are being made using the conditional tense. Either 
one is certain of the facts, and has evidence or one keeps 
quiet. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The Socialist Party this evening is looking for 
a new prodigy able to embody its ideas and to remotivate the 
electorate less than one year before the presidential elections. 
[passage omitted] The bitterness of Mr. Rocard and a strange 
day, as related by Ghislaine Chenu and Roland Sicard: 
  [Sicard] This is the first picture of Michel Rocard as a 
rank-and-file member of the Socialist Party. He has just been 
beaten, he is no longer the first secretary. His immediate 
reaction: 
  [Begin Rocard recording] This morning I suggested to the 
Socialist Party national council that it should go beyond 
factionalism. I suggested we should build a political movement 
which could meet the demands of the French people. Finally, I 
suggested that a team of gifted and sincere young politicians -- 
including Martine Aubry -- should join the national leadership. 
All this was rejected. This is why I resigned. It is now up 
to members to express themselves. As for me, I remain, I still 
am a fighter for hope. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Great excitement in the Socialist Party: Michel 
Rocard found himself in the minority and resigned as first 
secretary. Things were not dragged out, since Henri Emmanuelli 
was elected first secretary of the Socialist Party ad interim. 
[passage omitted] 
  The departure of Michel Rocard has opened up a new crisis in 
the Socialist Party. In order to overcome it as soon as 
possible, the National Council this evening elected Henri 
Emmanuelli first secretary, but in an acting capacity, until the 
next congress, which will be held in the autumn. Henri 
Emmanuelli, aged 49, is the former speaker of the National 
Assembly. In his first statement he paid tribute to Michel 
Rocard: 
  [Begin Emmanuelli recording] I should like, first of all, to 
praise the way in which Michel Rocard, the outgoing first 
secretary of the Socialist Party, has faced up with dignity to 
this day, which has passed off calmly, in a relative mood of 
fraternity -- I say relative because, when people are separated 
by the way they vote, there is always a degree of antagonism, 
but it has been calm. 
  To the activists I say that I hope that from now on we will 
be able to act in such a way as to recover the confidence of the 
men and women of the Left, who over these past months, sometimes 
over these past years, have felt that the Socialist Party was 
either not speaking out for their interests, or not speaking out 
for their hopes. [end recording]

  [Text] The Senate by a very large majority approved the 
1995-2000 Military Programming Law yesterday. Only the 
Communists voted against it. Since no amendment was retained, 
the law has now been definitively adopted. Answering questions 
with regard to the 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] freeze in the 
equipment budget (Fr1.9 billion) and the operating budget 
(Fr0.630 billion), Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that 
"France is engaged in a formidable economic war." Nevertheless, 
the defense minister hopes that this freeze will not lead to 
cancellation, as is feared by the Armed Forces, which saw their 
budget slashed already by Fr630 million in March.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen del Riego: "Aznar Warns That Government </F>
Should Take People's Party Into Account in Important Decisions"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The main conclusion that Aznar drew 
from the general [as published] election's outcome, addressing 
the People's Party [PP] Executive Committee yesterday, is that 
"nothing is the same," and the government must not scorn the 
public's wishes, "because you must not show disrespect for the 
polls," and so he warned that henceforth "no important decision 
should be taken in Spain that does not take the PP into account." 
  The analysis made by the PP leadership is that with the 
results of the European elections, "we are fully justified," and 
so now "we have greater strength to negotiate with the 
government, which must listen to us now." 
  As an instance of this, it was made clear at the PP 
Executive 
Committee meeting that the government cannot continue the 
completion of the autonomy map with the transfer of areas of 
responsibility to various communities "without the PP's taking 
part in that plan, because the PP's votes are sufficient for it 
to have to give its opinion on that configuration." Other 
instances of the matters on which, in the People's Party's 
opinion, the government will be unable to take decisions without 
taking it into account are the renewal of the institutions, 
without changing the majorities necessary for their election, or 
laws such as those on trade or cable television. 
  In his address to the Executive Committee, Jose Maria Aznar 
stressed that the PP should be pleased but not euphoric, and 
that the success achieved "should be used only to be improved 
on. It is a matter not of resting on our laurels, saying how 
well we have done to have won, but of seeing where we have 
failed in order to improve." 
  The PP has therefore set itself the aim of launching an 
offensive of putting forward specific proposals and drawing up 
sectorial programs in order to confirm the PP's ability to 
govern. Aznar set the party to work on this, not allowing it to 
rest and convening his main colleagues early in the morning, as 
on every Monday, in the so-called matins. In the afternoon, he 
convened the Executive Committee, because, as party leadership 
sources explained, "we have a great deal left to do, and we must 
be prepared for anything," referring to the possibility that 
Felipe Gonzalez may soon decide to call an election. 
  Nevertheless, it was not all work at the Executive Committee 
meeting, which received with loud ovations both the PP chairman 
and European candidate Abel Matutes and candidate for the 
Andalusian Junta [autonomous government] Javier Arenas. 
  Heeding the spirit expressed by Aznar, the PP, with the 
prospect of attaining power in the not too distant future, will 
begin this very week to put forward specific initiatives on the 
country's main problems, which in many cases will be a 
repetition of proposals that have already been put forward but 
that have not produced a sufficient response among the public or 
in the political sphere, since the PP has not been viewed as an 
immediate government alternative. It believes that this will 
change, "because after what happened Sunday [12 June], they will 
have to listen to us." 
  Aznar will meet with the parliamentary group Wednesday in 
order to analyze these initiatives, and Thursday the PP intends 
to submit a law on government. Next Monday, the PP chairman 
will convene the Executive Committee, with the intention of 
presenting an alternative economic blueprint to that of the 
government, "in order to tackle the economic crisis." 
  The conclusion conveyed by Jose Maria Aznar to the People's 
Party leaders is that it is the government that "must make a 
move" with respect to its future, and so a strategy of harassing 
the government with the possible submission of a censure motion 
is not being considered for the present; "rather, performing 
constructive work with respect to society," irrespective of 
whether or not there are resignations, cabinet reshuffles, or 
other initiatives that Gonzalez could undertake as a result of 
the election results. 
  As the same sources explained, the aim is to "to show that 
we 
know how to lose and know how to win, and that we are interested 
not in the country's faring badly but in making the state work," 
because, they add, "we must not disappoint the Spanish people 
now." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Paz: "PSOE Acknowledges That Its Voters' </F>
Punitive Vote Is Not Superficial or Short Term"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] acknowledges that the punitive vote that its voters cast 
Sunday [12 June -- in European Parliament elections], mainly 
thorough abstention or support for other political parties, "is 
not short term" or a simple warning, but a "much more serious 
and profound" reaction that will require changes and corrections 
in the government's policy and, in particular, in the 
Socialists' stances, as several leaders of the party told LA 
VANGUARDIA. 
  This conviction that the shift in the vote was more 
far-reaching than expected and hence the punishment "was not 
superficial" yesterday led the PSOE Executive Committee Standing 
Committee to decide to begin a process of internal reflection 
that will result in a "very rigorous and very realistic" 
analysis of the election results, without evading the true scale 
of its defeat last Sunday. 
  The Socialists believe that this is the only way to find the 
real causes that have led their voters -- "those who brought us 
to power," they say -- to deprive them of their support, and the 
only way to get right the corrections that they must henceforth 
tackle. 
  This more rigorous analysis of the defeat will be made next 
Monday at the Socialist Federal Executive Committee's plenary 
session. 
<H5>  Gonzalez Recommends Calm </H5>
  At the meeting held at the Moncloa Palace, shortly before 
Felipe Gonzalez left for Colombia, where he will be taking part 
in the Ibero-American summit, the prime minister recommended 
"calm" to the Socialist leadership in order to study the reasons 
for the debacle and not to make hasty decisions that could be 
wrong. Even so, one of those attending the meeting explained to 
this newspaper that "calm does not mean passivity." At that 
meeting, which was attended by all the Standing Committee 
members plus Andalusian premier Manuel Chaves, a superficial 
approach was made to analyzing the causes of the defeat, which 
was attributed to the fact that the public still does not notice 
the economic recovery, the corruption cases, and the internal 
discord. 
  But as well as accepting the electorate's "severe warning," 
it was made clear at the meeting, as Secretary for Organization 
Cipria Ciscar later explained, that the party "is united around 
the government's activity and Felipe Gonzalez' leadership." 
  In that initial urgent analysis, nobody raised the need for 
changing the policy of pacts with CiU [Convergence and Union], 
although some PSOE leaders believe that that alliance with the 
Catalan nationalists could have influenced the results in 
Andalusia. 
  In fact, the electoral setback in that autonomous community, 
which has been a traditional Socialist fief, is the reason that 
leads the PSOE to believe that the punishment by its voters was 
not short term but represented a much more serious voting shift 
"because," they say, "they have punished us where it could hurt 
us most," especially since in Andalusia the electorate could 
have opted for punishing the Socialists in the European 
elections but supporting them in the regional government. 
  Some of the possible solutions to this situation were also 
raised at the meeting, always trying to guarantee political 
stability. These included the possibility of Felipe Gonzalez' 
undergoing a confidence vote in parliament, an option that the 
Socialists do not rule out, although their CiU partners 
explicitly reject that possibility. In the Socialists' opinion, 
a confidence motion would be a gesture to society that they have 
understood the message, and would avoid giving the impression of 
passivity or of their believing that "nothing has happened." 
Whether or not to present one is a decision that the prime 
minister will have to take over the next few days, on his return 
from Colombia. 
  However, nobody raised the possibility of immediately 
calling an early election, an option that is on the agenda but 
that terrifies the PSOE, because it believes that in these 
circumstances it would mean "giving away victory to the People's 
Party." 
  Perhaps for this reason, Ciscar reiterated yesterday the 
Socialists' pledge to continue to promote political stability, 
as well as to apply "the necessary corrections and regain the 
public's confidence." To that effect, he also emphasized the 
party's and government's pledge to end corruption and "clean up 
political life, not just through legal measures but through 
ethical attitudes." 
  In the background to this debate, the Socialists are 
considering whether society now views them as an exhausted and 
outdated option, and what measures would make it possible to win 
back the support of an electorate that has been loyal to them 
for years and that has now mostly opted for abstention, with the 
aim of winning the next election. 
<H5>  Talk With All Political Forces </H5>
  The Socialists believe that one of the most immediate 
requirements of their electoral defeat is to begin a serious and 
calm dialogue with all the political forces, especially those 
such as CiU, which give them their parliamentary support, in 
order to analyze together the domestic situation created by last 
Sundays's election results, but they believe that those talks 
should also extend to the People's Party, not only in order to 
conduct that appraisal of the new political situation but also 
in order to discover what will be its stance in the near future. 
For the present, the Socialists are firmly maintaining the 
image of internal unity in the face of the electoral setback, 
but in private the different emphases that each of the sectors 
places on the consequences of the defeat are taking shape. Thus 
the Guerraists believe that their voters are demanding, as they 
did 6 June 1993, a "leftward shift," and certainly a cabinet 
reshuffle to strengthen the country's political leadership and 
end the impression of the government's lack of a political 
steady hand. The renewalists attribute the defeat both to the 
economic crisis and unemployment and to the recent corruption 
cases, which have damaged the Socialists' credibility and sown 
suspicions about their honesty and their readiness to combat all 
forms of unlawful conduct.

<F P=106> [Report by Xavier Ventura: "Pujol Confirms That CiU Will </F>
Not Alter Support for Government Despite PSOE's Defeat"] 
  [Excerpt] Jordi Pujol stated yesterday evening that CiU 
[Convergence and Union] will not alter its support for the 
government despite the poor results achieved by the PSOE 
[Spanish Socialist Workers Party], as long as there is a program 
understanding on autonomy and economic policy, and emphasized 
that the victory in Catalonia represents "endorsement" of the 
policy that CiU has carried out in Spain over the past 12 months. 
  The nationalist coalition's first victory over the Catalan 
Socialists in elections other than autonomous community 
elections confirms, according to Jordi Pujol, the "upward trend" 
that CiU experienced in the last general election, within the 
line of the coalition's "systematic and gradual" growth since 
the beginning of the eighties. This growth, the Democratic 
Convergence of Catalonia chairman continued, is more significant 
since the turnout was not what Pujol had wanted, having turned 
much of his campaign into a moral appeal to the Catalan people 
to vote. 
  Jordi Pujol was emphatic in asserting that unless the 
political circumstances in Spain change -- that is, if the PSOE 
stands fast and is not affected by this defeat, or the People's 
Party does not succeed in eroding its work -- Felipe Gonzalez is 
assured of CiU's support, since "our availability for the 
state's stability depends not on the European election results 
but on the government's continuing with a policy that will make 
it possible to tackle the country's problems with a chance of 
success." In this connection, Pujol reiterated that the 
economic policy is crucial if CiU is to continue its support for 
the government, although he pointed out that changes in autonomy 
policy are also necessary. 
  The CiU leader said that the coalition will not use the 
PSOE's defeat -- of which he said that it was "a very serious 
warning" to the government -- in order to "introduce" elements 
that would hamper relations between CiU and the Socialists, 
since the proposals that the Catalan nationalists will continue 
to make will be of "general interest." Despite this, Jordi 
Pujol emphasized on several occasions that these results could 
affect Spanish politics and hence have repercussions on CiU's 
stance, although he pointed out that this depends not on CiU 
itself but on the government's continuing to retain the majority 
that it needs for its activity: "Felipe Gonzalez has 176 
deputies after these elections; the same as he had yesterday and 
the same as he will have tomorrow," and so there will be no 
changes in Spanish politics unless "internal forces" in the 
Socialist Party or external to it change the current situation, 
since "stability depends on the PSOE and the People's Party -- 
not on us." Pujol also deemed a government confidence motion 
"neither necessary nor desirable," pointing out that the current 
legislative term is much more effective than the previous one 
with respect to the struggle against the economic crisis in 
Spain. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Italy is the European country that has said most 
clearly that it is ready to intervene in Rwanda, but on 
condition that the intervention is not a unilateral or 
multilateral one, but it takes place under an international 
umbrella. Here is Defense Minister Cesare Previti: 
  [Begin Previti recording] We can take part in international 
humanitarian and peace operations. If we reach agreement to do 
something, we are ready and we have already said so. Reaching 
the agreement is the problem. We have tried to speed things up 
through the WEU [Western European Union]; there will be another 
meeting on Tuesday [21 June]. The French are insisting on a 
unilateral operation in which we have no intention of taking 
part, I believe. [end recording]
