  [Text] Copenhagen, June 22 (AFP) -- The United Nations has 
installed radar stations in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to 
pinpoint assailants, the Danish defence minister said Wednesday 
[22 June]. 
  Hans Haekkerup said in a written reply to parliament's 
Defence Committee that "these radars were set up in Tuzla, 
Sarajevo, Bihac and Mostar, after Tuzla airport was shelled on 
May 17." 
  At the time, Denmark had complained that the UN Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] had not responded to requests for air support 
by the Danish contingent, which was being attacked, had made. 
  The radars, which have a 30 kilometre (19 mile) range with 
20 
metre (66 foot) accuracy, can pinpoint the location of guns and 
canon and thereby enable the United Nations to riposte.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham and Dh. P. Dhimas from Washington] </F>
  [Text] Athens could continue the Greek-Turkish dialogue at 
a low level and on issues that would not concern the Aegean, 
based on the inactive 1988 summit agreements between Athens and 
Ankara -- specifically the "Memorandum of Vouliaymeni of 1988" 
-- signed by Karolos Papoulias and Mesut Yilmaz. 
  Yesterday, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis proposed this 
to his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, who was quick to express 
the hope that the Greek Government will deal with the tension in 
the Aegean with "care and sensitivity." 
  Athens appears to be well-aware that the U.S. Government 
wants to: 
  a) promote its economic, political, and military penetration 
in the Balkans and, 
  b) support Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's government. 
  The U.S. Government wants to play a "catalytic role" in the 
settlement of Greek-Turkish differences. Without wanting to 
stir up Greek-Turkish relations, the Greek Government does not 
want an isolated U.S. mediation role. According to government 
sources, it wants to point out that the Greek-Turkish dispute is 
also a problem of the international organizations, i.e., NATO. 
Arsenis told his U.S. interlocutors that Greece also has a NATO 
responsibility to protect the Aegean airspace (area 41) [not 
further identified] and called U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's statement about disarming fighter planes in the 
Aegean "disproportionate." 
  The Greek side reiterated its firm position that it cannot 
abandon its sovereign rights in the Aegean and that an attempt 
to resume Greek-Turkish dialogue through the "hot" issues will 
immediately lead to a deadlock. 
  It is unknown whether the U.S. side has accepted or 
understood the Greek position on the Aegean, but it appeared 
receptive. 
  Arsenis also expressed Greek views and plans about 
broadening 
cooperation with the United States, even military cooperation in 
the Balkans within the framework of prospects of the 
"Cooperation for Peace" treaty. Reviewing the situation, he 
showed particular concern about border incidents between Serbia 
and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. 
  The Arsenis-Perry meeting gave the two sides the opportunity 
to briefly outline the agenda of the talks they will have in 
Athens during the U.S. defense secretary's official visit in 
July. 
  According to informed observers, Arsenis passed the 
"message" 
that during Perry's visit to Athens, the Greek side wants talks 
on establishing a headquarters in Larissa. Its said that the 
Americans received "contradictory messages" from Greece on this 
issue, because of Deputy Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris' 
opposition. 
  Specifically, according to U.S. military sources, Kouris 
removed from the agenda of the bilateral defense talks, which 
were held in Orlando in January, the issue of the establishment 
of a headquarters in Larissa. The topic was included at the 
U.S. initiative. 
  Earlier, in December, the U.S. received an "Arsenis message" 
through Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou that the 
Greek side wanted to begin talks on the headquarters issue. The 
distance of views resulted in U.S. accusations about "Greek 
double-talk" on the headquarters issue. 
  Before meeting Perry and John Shalikaskvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Arsenis had breakfast at the Greek 
Embassy with U.S. presidential adviser George Stefanopoulos, 
immediately after arriving in Washington.

  [Text] Ankara, June 22 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said today that Turkey was to continue initiatives 
and efforts so that U.S. aid is given in line with Turkey's 
views. 
  Ataman told his weekly press conference that Turkey would 
not 
accept the linking of the U.S. aid to any precondition. 
  He also recalled that the House Appropriations Committee has 
not approved the proposal passed by the House of Representatives 
to suspend 25 percent of the aid to Turkey. 
  `In return the Senate committee decided to include a clause 
in the text under which U.S. military material sold and 
transferred to Turkey will not be used by Turkey for domestic 
security and police purposes,' he said. 
  Ataman said that that decision was to be put before the 
Senate. 
  `Since there is a difference between the text of the House 
and the Senate, the committee has to review the issue,' Ataman 
said. 
  `If the committee agrees on a conciliating text, this will 
then be voted separately in the general assembly of the Senate 
and the House and submitted to the approval of the president,' 
Ataman said. 
  `However, if a conciliation is not reached,' he said, `it 
was 
likely that the previous practices on extending aid to Turkey 
might prevail.'

<F P=106> [Joint interview with French President Francois Mitterrand </F>
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by unidentified WORLD MEDIA 
correspondents; place and date not given: "Unification -- An 
Issue of War and Peace for the 21st Century"] 
  [Excerpts] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French 
President Francois Mitterrand granted a special joint interview 
to the WORLD MEDIA network, of which LIDOVE NOVINY is a part, on 
the occasion of the commemorations held to mark the 50th 
anniversary of the Normandy landings. [passage omitted] 
  [WORLD MEDIA] The anniversary of the landings has also 
brought to mind the impressive entry of the United States onto 
the European scene. What kind of military role should the 
United States be playing in Europe now? 
  [Kohl] The connection with the North American democracies 
and the U.S. presence in Europe are visible symbols for 
Europeans of the values shared on both sides of the Atlantic, as 
well as the basis for defending peace and security in Europe. I 
am pleased, therefore, that, at the recent NATO summit, 
President Clinton renewed the commitment to maintain 100,000 
troops in Europe. An active transatlantic alliance, along with 
the European Union, is a fundamental condition for ensuring that 
the new European democracies can be brought into the Western 
community. 
  [Mitterrand] The vitality of the connection between the 
United States and Europe is a basic element of our security, and 
the U.S. military presence in Europe illustrates this 
connection. Therefore, during the current discussions on NATO's 
development, I always defended the view that nothing should be 
done that would divert the alliance from its fundamental task of 
being a security guarantee for its members. Of course, this 
should not prevent the Europeans from creating a common defense. 
We have made progress here too. I had the feeling at the 
recent Atlantic summit that our overseas partners understood 
that strengthening the Western European Union [WEU] is not aimed 
at weakening NATO, but that it represents Europe's desire to 
accept the responsibility for its own security and defense and 
that it leads to it being able to provide long-term guarantees 
in harmony with the preamble to the North Atlantic Treaty. 
  [WORLD MEDIA] France and Germany have agreed to establish a 
joint military force, a "European Corps." In your opinion, is 
this the nucleus for a future European army? 
  [Kohl] By creating a European unit, President Mitterrand and 
myself wanted, from the very beginning, to give a European 
aspect to close Franco-German cooperation. Since then, our 
invitation to the WEU states to take part in units has been 
accepted by Belgium, and Spanish membership is being discussed. 
The European unit will operate in 1995, and it already 
represents a successful model for European military structures. 
It is strengthening both the WEU and European involvement in 
NATO. It may also be a prototype for further European units 
within the increasingly closer Union. I am especially pleased 
that President Mitterrand has invited German, French, and 
Belgian units to Paris for a parade on 14 July. 
  [Mitterrand] My answer is clearly, yes. Will the embryo 
grow and will a European army be born from it? Time will answer 
this question. I believe, however, that the progressive 
establishment of a truly European defense body, supplied with 
the necessary equipment and serving common aims will, at the 
appropriate moment, be a real gauge of the European Union's 
success. 
  [WORLD MEDIA] The recent commemorations reminded us that the 
United States plays a significant role in European politics, 
culture, and society. How does this role appear to you? Does 
it symbolize current relations between the United States and 
Europe? 
  [Kohl] The transatlantic bridge that links us firmly with 
the United States and Canada had, primarily, a security 
significance during the Cold War. Now, we must make this bridge 
more passable and intensify cooperation in spheres such as the 
economy, culture, and science. First and foremost, the 
intensity of the exchanges between young people, who could 
reinforce friendship across the Atlantic, is important. 
  [Mitterrand] The United States has an important position in 
Europe on all levels. This is given by its qualities, dynamism, 
and creativity. It is also given, of course, by its economic 
strength and the size of its market. Our most major competitors 
are here, which is intensified even more by our nonuniformity. 
Despite this, we in Europe have at our disposal considerable 
creative potential in technology, science, culture, art, and so 
on. As far as I am concerned, I consider this fact to be one of 
the other reasons for strengthening the European Union and this 
may then enhance the dialogue between Europe and the United 
States.

  [Text] Brussels, June 22 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization issued a summary Wednesday [22 June] 
outlining its partnership programme with Russia, a deal it said 
would correspond "to Russia's size, importance and capabilities." 
  The one-page document was released as Russia completed an 
historic turnabout by signing NATO's Partnership for Peace 
programme of military cooperation. 
  The document was titled "Summary of Conclusions of 
Discussions Between the North Atlantic Council and Foreign 
Minister of Russia Andrey Kozyrev." 
  Herewith are the four main points as outlined in the 
release: 
  1. Both the Alliance and Russia have important contributions 
to make to European stability and security. Constructive, 
cooperative relations of mutual respect, benefit and friendship 
between the Alliance and Russia are therefore a key element for 
security and stability in Europe and in the interest of all 
other states in the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe) area. 
  Both the Alliance and Russia welcome the progress already 
made in their relations, including within the NACC (North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council), and seek to strengthen them 
further. 
  2. The signature of Partnership for Peace by Russia opens a 
further important opportunity to develop relations through 
practical cooperation in the fields included in the Partnership 
for Peace Framework Document. 
  The Alliance agreed to develop an extensive Individual 
Partnership Programme coresponding to Russia's size, importance 
and capabilities. 
  3. They agreed to set in train the development of a 
far-reaching, cooperative NATO/Russia relationship, both inside 
and outside Partnership for Peace. This relationship, aimed at 
enhancing mutual confidence and openness, will be developed in a 
way that reflects common objectives and complements and 
reinforces relations with all other states, and is not directed 
against the interest of third countries and is transparent to 
others. 
  4. The Alliance and Russia agreed to pursue broad, enhanced 
dialogue and cooperation in areas where Russia has unique and 
important contributions to make, commensurate with its weight 
and responsibility as a major European, international and 
nuclear power through: sharing of information on issues 
regarding politico-security related to matters having a European 
dimension; political consultations, as appropriate, on issues of 
common concern; cooperation in a range of security related areas 
including, as appropriate, in the peacekeeping field.

  [Text] [Announcer] In statements made to this radio station 
Javier Solana, Spanish foreign minister, said Spain was willing 
to contribute to the logistics of the French intervention in 
Rwanda as soon as the UN Security Council has given the go-ahead 
for this military operation. Javier Solana. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Here is the latest information. 
This morning -- local time in New York -- the UN Security 
Council will pass a resolution allowing a multinational force to 
distribute humanitarian aid along the Rwandan borders to Rwandan 
citizens who are being expelled. It will not be deployed in 
Rwanda. 
  Spain's role: Spain will vote in favor of this Security 
Council resolution. It not only supports this resolution, Spain 
was the first country to suggest that such an initiative had to 
be taken. 
  Secondly, what kind of aid are we going to contribute? Spain 
will not deploy armed forces in the field. We will lend 
logistical support to the whole operation which will be run by 
the French. The French already have troops deployed in Africa 
and they will be in charge of the operation. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Up until now the French have received support 
from the members of the Western European Union meeting today in 
Brussels.

<F P=106> [Report by Fotis Kafarakis from Corfu--recorded statements </F>
in English with Greek subtitles] 
  [Text] The first foreign delegations began arriving at 
Ioannis Kapodhistrias Airport in Corfu around 1800 today. More 
than 800 people were expected to arrive in Corfu today. These 
were the heads of the European socialist parties and their 
delegations that will participate in the European Socialist 
Party conference. More than 2,500 people are expected to arrive 
in the next few days. These are the delegations of the twelve 
European Union [EU] members, the four new members, Russia, and 
Cyprus. 
  [Begin recording] [Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring] I 
hope 
there will be lots of agreements in Corfu. Also, I would like 
to congratulate the Greek presidency on the work it has done in 
the past six months. We have the signing of the agreements with 
the EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries tomorrow, 
which is a major progress for the European Union. We also have 
the signing of the cooperation agreement with the Russian 
Federation, which is in everybody's interest in Europe. We 
obviously have the question of the succession of Jacques Delors. 
This matter will be discussed. I would hope we can make 
progress, but we will obviously know tomorrow afternoon or 
evening. 
  [Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky] It is true that we 
ended up with a very good result at the Austrian referendum for 
a country joining the European Union. I think the explanation 
for the very good result was that the Austrian Federal 
Government and the so-called partners and the universities and 
many many others joined forces in showing to the Austrian people 
that joining the European Union is more or less a logical step 
for Austria, because it has been linked and integrated with the 
Twelve for so many years or even decades that it means more or 
less formalizing a logical step. Well, from my point of view, 
the Greek presidency actually deserves the respect of a country 
that negotiated its entry into the European Union taking into 
account that we finalized our negotiations under the Greek 
presidency and we finalized our negotiations especially from the 
point of view that we came through with our own interest, 
without being in conflict or controversy with the European Union 
and its members. So, the Greek Presidency served as a very 
important and efficient catalyst for our own negotiations. [end

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos has said 
that at the Corfu summit the Greek Presidency will promote the 
beginning of negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the European 
Union [EU]. He described the recent EU Council of Foreign 
Ministers's evaluation as particularly encouraging. According 
to the evaluation, the Twelve blamed Turkish intransigence. EU 
Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek reiterated this position in 
Ankara. 
  Venizelos said it is becoming a common view that the 
procedure for Cyprus' accession to the EU and the speed of this 
procedure cannot be held hostage by the Turkish occupation of 
the island and by Turkish Cypriot and Turkish intransigence. 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will meet European 
Commission President Jacques Delors and Cypriot President 
Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow night.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de </F>
Marco by Reinhold Brender in La Valletta on 20 June: "`Malta 
Wants To Be Bridge Across the Mediterranean'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Malta -- the biggest island 
gave the state its name -- sees itself today as part of Europe 
and, by its geography and culture, feels qualified to be a 
"bridge" across the sea to the Mediterranean's southern shores. 
As Foreign Minister De Marco said in an interview with 
FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Malta can strengthen the European Union 
[EU]. De Marco is hoping that negotiations on his country's 
accession to the European Union will start at the end of this 
year or in early 1995. [passage omitted] 
  After the conservatives took power from the Labor Party 
seven 
years ago (the electoral law had meanwhile been changed, so that 
the party that received the most votes also got a majority in 
parliament), they submitted a membership application in July 
1990. In June 1993, Brussels noted that Malta fulfilled the 
conditions for EU membership, but posed certain conditions: The 
economy, which was oriented along socialist models under the 
preceding Labor rule, had to be modified through comprehensive 
reform. 
  De Marco, who is also deputy government head, believes that 
important conditions have been fulfilled now and that the 
question is no longer whether Malta will join, but when it will 
do so. To prove this, the foreign minister refers to efforts 
for economic opening: Important business branches have been 
liberalized, manufacturing industries restructured, services 
promoted. According to official figures, 4.5 percent of the 
population who are fit to work are without jobs, and a 
considerable economic growth was achieved last year. At the 
beginning of next year, Malta will unilaterally lift duties 
toward the EU, compensating for the loss in revenues by a 
value-added tax, which has not existed on Malta so far. Under 
these conditions, negotiations should "not be very complicated," 
De Marco said. Even today, three-fourths of the country's 
foreign trade is with the EU. 
  It is widely assumed that EU membership would seal Malta's 
departure from the officially nonaligned and neutral, yet in 
fact sometimes fickle and anti-Western, course that was pursued 
during the 16 years of Labor government. Under Prime Minister 
Dom Mintoff, Malta concluded cooperation agreements with Moscow, 
Beijing, and even Tripoli, with which it used to cooperate 
temporarily in the military arena. [passage omitted] 
  Even though, according to government calculations, economic 
advantages will outweigh the disadvantages (fishery and some 
industrial branches are regarded as problem areas), Malta is 
trying to take this step mainly for political reasons. De Marco 
says the concept of nonalignment was "outdated" after the end of 
the East-West antagonism. [passage omitted] To be firmly 
anchored in the EU will offer Malta security, while neutrality 
without any affiliation can be dangerous. A few days ago, when 
he was the first representative of his country to have the honor 
to address the Western European Union in Brussels, the foreign 
minister said about the defense organization of the Europeans: 
"We accept this responsibility not only as another element of 
the common set of laws, to which all Europeans have to be 
committed, but also as part of the political finality that we 
share with our European partners." 
  Even though a small country, Malta is of strategic 
importance, Marco said in the interview. Cooperation between 
the North and South, and thus the "question of the 
Mediterranean," are shifting into the center of international 
politics. Malta has been one of the first countries to point 
out that European security is inseparably linked with the 
Mediterranean. Malta is taking part in the dialogue between the 
countries on the southern and northern shores of the 
Mediterranean, it is pursuing the objective of a Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean (CSCM), to be 
modeled after the CSCE, as well as a Mediterranean Council, 
modeled after the Council of Europe. "The Mediterranean will 
determine Malta's future as it has determined its history." 
  The foreign minister is convinced that Malta's voice will be 
heard in the EU. [passage omitted] De Marco said he understood 
that the EU must first "digest" Austria's accession and -- after 
positive referendums in those countries -- those of Finland, 
Sweden, and Norway before it will be Malta's turn. Finally, the 
minister emphasized that "positive signals" from Brussels could 
strengthen his government's dynamism aimed at EU accession. 
Contrary to the government party, the Labor Party is against 
Malta's EU membership and has called for close ties. In the 
view of the Labor Party, such ties should permit the country to 
benefit from cooperation with Europe while it would not have to 
fear the disadvantages of EU membership.

<F P=106> [Alexandra Schwartzbrod report: "Eurosatory Show Opens -- </F>
Arms Manufacturers on War Footing"] 
  [Text] In a context of declining arms sales and growing 
European cooperation in equipment manufacturing, the Eurosatory 
land-based weapons show opens in Paris today. It will be 
attended by over 500 manufacturers hoping to find new markets. 
  While the bloody conflicts still racking Rwanda and the 
former Yugoslavia remain in the media, the Eurosatory land-based 
weapons show in Le Bourget welcomes over 500 arms manufacturers, 
mostly from Europe, but also, for the first time this year, from 
the United States and Canada. Expected at the show (which the 
general public is not allowed to attend) are 50,000 professional 
visitors, including more than 400 politicians and officers from 
some 81 countries. [French Defense Minister] Francois Leotard 
is expected to announce today that the next show will be open to 
manufacturers from all over the world (Russians included). 
There may be a degree of disruption this year as the Greenpeace 
organization is for the first time launching a broad awareness 
campaign on the danger of antipersonnel land mines. 
  The show will enable arms manufacturers to find out whether 
their surprising optimism for the coming years is justified. 
Evidence of such optimism can be found in a survey published by 
the [French] Association of Land-Based Weapons Manufacturers. 
True, the sector can hardly know tougher times than it already 
has over the last four years. Since 1990, the French land-based 
weapons industry has lost 30 percent of its work force and 31 
percent of its revenues. Exports will not save it, as 
international markets appear to be totally saturated or 
"complicated" (e.g., Saudi Arabia) until at least 1995. 
Salvation may come in the form of industrial restructuring and, 
above all, European cooperation projects, which seem to be more 
than mere pipe dreams this year. The main event announced at 
Eurosatory will be the significant agreement in the field of 
wheeled armored vehicles entered into with Germany's Mercedes 
Benz and Krauss Maffei by GIAT Industries; the latter has 
indisputably been chosen by the French authorities as their 
"champion" in the field of land-based weapons. This agreement 
seems to indicate that the next battle tank, if there is to be 
one, will at worst be built by France and Germany, and at best 
by several European manufacturers. 
<H5>  Hope of Market Recovery </H5>
  The Franco-German agreement is largely motivated by the 
existence of the Eurocorps, which is scheduled to take part in 
the 14 July parade on the Champs Elysees. According to the 
"TTU" [expansion unknown] confidential letter, the French and 
German Defense Ministries requested Siemens and Thomson-CSF to 
merge the computer-aided command systems they had been offering 
separately into a single system. As for restructuring measures, 
while European missile manufacturers seem intent on keeping a 
low profile this week, they will only do so because most of them 
are currently in the process of finalizing mergers: Matra with 
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale with Germany's DASA [Deutsche 
Aerospace]. 
  Not that mergers should be considered as a panacea. To wit 
the difficulties encountered by Eurocopter, born of the merger 
of DASA and Aerospatiale's helicopter operations. For arms 
manufacturers, salvation will mostly come from market recovery. 
Hence the Balladur government's decision to increase equipment 
credits for the French Armed Forces by 0.5 percent annually over 
five years as stipulated in the Military Programming Act 
recently passed by Parliament. 
  France, Great Britain, and Germany make up about 70 percent 
of the European defense industry's production capacity and work 
force.

<F P=106> [Report by Conor O'Clery: "Taoiseach Foresees Cross-Border </F>
Authority"] 
  [Text] Boston -- A form of cross-Border authority with 
executive powers is being sought by the Government in 
negotiations with Britain as a quid pro quo for dropping 
Articles 2 and 3 from the Constitution, the Taoiseach [Irish 
Prime Minister], Mr Reynolds, has said. 
  In an interview in Boston yesterday with THE IRISH TIMES, Mr 
Reynolds said it was futile to talk in isolation about removing 
the constitutional claim to the North and that there had to be a 
balanced constitutional agreement. Spelling out for the first 
time what this means, Mr Reynolds said: "Institutional links 
between North and South will have executive powers. That's the 
type of overall framework we're looking to." 
  He said there was still a "fair bit of work to be done" in 
the talks between officials from Dublin and London, but he was 
hopeful he and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, could 
achieve their aim of agreement by mid-July. 
  Mr Reynolds was in Boston to receive the Christian A. Herter 
Memorial Award from the World Affairs Council of Boston for his 
role in the peace process. 
  President Clinton sent a message of congratulations to Mr 
Reynolds who, he said, had earned the respect and admiration of 
world leaders for his contribution to peace. 
  In his acceptance speech, Mr Reynolds laid stress on the 
need 
for a balanced constitutional accommodation. New arrangements, 
he said, "must provide a clear and explicit institutional 
framework for the development of the necessary North-South 
co-operation and co- ordination in areas of mutual benefit." 
  Expanding on this in his interview, Mr Reynolds said there 
had to be an even-handed approach in the negotiations with 
Britain and therefore the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and 
Articles 2 and 3 should be on the table "for negotiation both 
ways." 
  "That's the Act that set up partition in the first place, 
but 
it also had the intentions of the British Government at the time 
to move on towards eventual unity of Ireland, and that (in the 
meantime) intermediate steps would be taken," he said. 
  Asked if he was seeking a quid pro quo involving some type 
of 
cross-border authority with executive powers in return for the 
dropping of Articles 2 and 3, Mr Reynolds said: "Those are the 
type of areas we are exploring between the two governments at 
the moment. What I'm saying is institutional links between North 
and South will have executive powers. That's the type of 
overall framework we're looking to, but that emanates clearly 
from the contents of the Downing Street Declaration." 
  Mr Reynolds acknowledged that unionists might view this as a 
form of the Council of Ireland which they had strongly rejected 
in the past. 
  In the declaration, "we make it clear that there has to be a 
wider settlement involving other relationships, internal 
relationships in Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and 
an institutional framework to reflect the diversity of the two 
parts and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain." 
  On the role of the United States, Mr Reynolds said the 
message from the United States to the nationalists was: "We're 
here to support you but we're not here to support any 
continuation of violence. Give up the violence and you can rely 
on us for our support to see that the cause is not ignored and 
that whatever commitments are given will be implemented." 
  Mr Reynolds continued: "That's a very important guarantor 
situation for the United States and the people in the United 
States to have taken up." He said he now expected a response 
from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street Declaration by "the early 
days of July, if not before."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
(Christian Democratic Union) has welcomed Russia's joining the 
NATO Partnership for Peace program. In Bonn, the minister spoke 
of a "historical milestone in a process, which gives Europe more 
stability and thus safeguards peace." With this, NATO has very 
quickly taken up the proposals presented by Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev in Brussels on 24 May and turned them 
into a future-oriented project. The NATO program is proving to 
be a flexible mechanism, which permits living up to the 
participants' individual interests in the spirit of the common 
whole.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) has also welcomed the Russian 
decision to join the Partnership for Peace. The agreement to 
build partnership relations with Russia, which has now been 
made, is an important building block in the efforts to establish 
cooperative security structures for all of Europe, Kinkel said 
in Bonn. The goal is to interlace closely the existing 
institutions and structures. In a network of relations, all 
institutions -- NATO just as the CSCE, Western European Union, 
and European Union -- can contribute their respective, very own 
advantages, the minister said.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Claes: Paris Wants To Create a </F>
`Safe Area' in Rwanda or Zaire"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 21 Jun (BELGA) -- Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes reaffirmed Tuesday [21 June] that Belgium would not 
provide troops for the two-month humanitarian operation Paris 
would like to launch in Rwanda with the help of African 
countries in order to protect the people from massacres while 
awaiting reinforcements from the blue helmets. 
  The Belgian foreign minister also let it be understood that 
the aim of French intervention was to create a "safe area" in 
western Rwanda (which is still controlled by the Rwandan 
Government Army) or in Zaire to protect the people. Claes told 
the press, however, that this operation could lead to a "massive 
evacuation" of Tutsis to neighboring countries, most likely 
Zaire, to shelter them temporarily from the massacres, with the 
hope of subsequently returning them to Rwanda. 
  "We will not provide troops, but we are prepared to provide 
logistical support," Mr. Claes said, referring to food aid and 
telecommunications support. 
  According to the minister, sending Belgian troops, or even 
civilians, within the framework of the International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC), to Rwanda has been ruled out as long as 
the anti-Belgian campaign continues in Rwanda. This campaign 
has been fed by Hutu extremist radio stations which accuse 
Belgium of being responsible for the death of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana last 6 April in a mysterious plane accident. 
  Mr. Claes stated, however, that "Belgium was expecting Paris 
to give it a list of what it wants. The United States is also 
prepared to provide logistical support," he noted. 
  The minister also called on France not to underestimate the 
"military risks" of a direct confrontation with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) during the operation for which it is 
currently trying to get the go-ahead from the UN Security 
Council, despite the opposition of certain French politicians, 
the OAU, and the RPF. 
  According to Claes, it is to avoid such confrontation that 
the French Government has chosen to operate out of Goma, a 
Zairian town located on the Rwandan border and alongside lake 
Kivu. 
  Claes added that ``Paris has initiated informal contacts 
with 
the RPF in several countries to try and convince the rebel 
movement that its initiative was genuinely humanitarian and was 
aimed at saving Tutsis who are still in the area controlled by 
the Rwandan Government Army. 
  ``I do not think that the French, who in my opinion, are 
acting under pressure from French public opinion, have an 
interest in consolidating the positions of the government 
Army,'' Mr. Claes added. 
  Claes went on to explain that the maximum duration of two 
months for intervention was set by France to await the 
implementation of UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] by 
the United Nations. UNAMIR-II should primarily be composed of 
African blue helmets.

<F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Overseas Development </F>
Administration: "Britain To Help Rehabilitate Villages in 
Northern Iraq"] 
  [Text] Britain is to provide an aid grant of 1.6 million 
pounds to help rehabilitate villages in Kurdish areas in 
northern Iraq. This was announced today in Geneva at the United 
Nations donors conference on Iraq. 
  Since 1975 the Government of Iraq has been destroying 
villages in northern Iraq and moving survivors into collective 
villages. Some 4,600 villages and their agriculture have been 
destroyed. 
  The grant will help "Save the Children Fund" rehabilitate 
216 
villages and provide shelter for 700 families. The project 
includes a voucher system whereby villages can exchange vouchers 
to obtain goods worth 410 pounds. Agricultural inputs and 
livestock will also be provided to help meet basic human needs. 
  An official from the Overseas Development Administration 
[ODA] visited northern Iraq in March and was impressed by the 
commitment of the villagers to return to their villages and 
start farming again. 
<H5>  Note for Editors </H5>
  The ODA's total expenditure on humanitarian aid to Iraqi 
civilians is over 66 million pounds since April 1991. This 
includes at least 4 million pounds to Save the Children Fund for 
a variety of projects.

  [Text] Bonn -- Economic growth, the fight against 
unemployment, and internal security will be the central issues 
during Germany's half-year European Union [EU] presidency, 
beginning 1 July. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt (both Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
informed the press on Wednesday [22 June] about relevant talks 
that were held in the Federal Cabinet. On Thursday, Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Klaus Kinkel will go to the European 
summit on the island of Corfu, which will end the Greek 
presidency. 
  In terms of external affairs, Bonn wants to speed up the 
"common foreign and security policy." This will include the 
project of securing the Ukrainian nuclear power plant at 
Chernobyl, which experts say is facing another catastrophe. 
Germany and France are planning a joint program to secure the 
three blocks that are still in operation and to concrete over 
the fourth block that exploded in 1986. Without renewing the 
Block Four "sarcophagus," costs are estimated at some 1.5 
billion German marks. So far, the EU partners have, however, 
hardly shown any interest in that project. 
  According to Kinkel, internal security will involve a 
harmonization of the asylum and immigration laws. He said he 
will continue to point out that Germany has taken in double the 
number of refugees of all the other 11 EU partner countries put 
together. 
  During its presidency, Germany will also make efforts to 
move 
the Central and East European states closer to the European 
Union by means of agreements on closer cooperation. As a kind 
of starting point, Russia's President Boris Yeltsin will 
participate in part of the Corfu Summit. On 24 June, he will 
initial the partnership agreement with the other heads of state 
and government, which will practically grant Russia 
most-favored-nation treatment in trade with the EU countries. 
For the first time, this will include services as well. 
  The Corfu Summit will also see the signing of the membership 
agreement by the four heads of government and the foreign 
ministers of the future members Norway, Sweden, Finland, and 
Austria, although the enforcement is still subject to 
referendums in some of these countries. The Federal Government 
considers the entry of the four new members particularly 
important. Diplomatic circles are hoping for a strengthening of 
the "northern" interests within the community. Economics 
Minister Rexrodt announced the introduction of an information 
system in which the states will monitor each other in observing 
a strict budget discipline, thus speeding up the progressing 
convergence of the individual economic and financial policies, 
including the ceilings for public debts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italian Agenda for </F>
Corfu Summit"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, June 22 -- Italy will try to delay 
the election of a new European Commission president and will 
raise objections to financing proposed for the so-called Delors 
Plan on jobs at the summit of EU [European Union] leaders in 
Corfu, Greece, this weekend, Foreign Undersecretary Livio Caputo 
told reporters Wednesday [22 June]. 
  On the election of a new EU executive chief, to replace 
resigning president Jacques Delors, Italy will ask that a 
special summit be called in September because a unanimous 
decision "is impossible today" and forcing a decision at the 
Greek summit may cause rifts within the Union. 
  Germany and France have endorsed Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene but Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 
seems undecided between Dehaene and Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers. Two other candidates are also in the running for the 
Commission presidency. 
  The two top items on the agenda at Corfu June 24 and 25 are 
the signing of a cooperation accord with Russia and the signing 
of membership treaties with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway, 
which would join the Union in January 1995 if the governments of 
all 12 member states ratify the treaties in time. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Andrew Marshall in Brussels and Colin Brown: "EU </F>
Heads for Deadlock on Presidency"] 
  [Text] Deadlock on the choice of a new president for the 
EU [European Union] Commission is all but certain at the Corfu 
summit this weekend, with the two main candidates both refusing 
to pull out of the race. 
  John Major would be relieved to postpone the decision until 
a 
special summit under the German presidency. The Prime Minister 
would face a storm of criticism from his anti-European right 
wing if the Belgian Prime Minister lean-Luc Dehaene, wins. But 
the Government does not expect to be alone in seeking a delay. 
  Foreign Office sources hinted that they were hoping for a 
"white knight" to emerge as an acceptable candidate during the 
next six months. Peter Sutherland, the former Irish EU 
Commissioner, now the head of GATT, is one option Britain would 
be prepared to consider. 
  As European Union leaders drawn from Christian Democratic 
parties assembled in Brussels last night, Ruud Lubbers, the 
Dutch Prime Minister, discounted the idea that he was about to 
defer to Mr Dehaene. "No. Not at all, of course not," said the 
Dutchman testily. 
  At their meeting last night the Christian Democrats failed 
to 
agree on a consensus candidate. 
  Mr Lubbers' irritation has grown as France and Germany have 
tried to make his opponent's selection seem a foregone 
conclusion. Mr Dehaene, accused by British Euro-sceptics of 
being a Euro-federalists in the Delors mould, only formally 
entered the race last week and is not likely to back away now. 
The two met last night in a frosty encounter. Both will also 
be at the two-day summit starting in Corfu tomorrow. 
  Germany's Helmut Kohl, also a Christian Democrat, has 
annoyed 
several EU leaders by appearing to settle the matter when he met 
Francois Mitterrand in Mulhouse earlier this month. Now the 
Italians are saying that they see no reason why a decision needs 
to be taken immediately; the British concur; the Portuguese are 
miffed; and it is more than likely that there will be no 
decision. 
  In London, senior ministers fear the Prime Minister has been 
boxed into a corner by reports of his intention to use the veto 
against the allegedly Euro-fanatical Mr Dehaene in Corfu. They 
fear he would lose credibility and face a rebellion by the Tory 
right wing if he accepted the Belgian, even though, in truth, 
the Government has no particular objection to him. 
  Germany takes on the EU presidency next month, and it has 
already considered the possibilities for a special summit to 
settle the question in September. Britain is still supporting 
Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's trade commissioner, for the 
president's job. But his chances are slim; it seems more likely 
he will get an extension of his role to cover more foreign 
policy issues when Commission portfolios are sorted out later 
this year. 
  If there is no decision in Corfu, a "dark horse" might be 
preferred to break the deadlock. 
  Mr Sutherland is not yet the preferred candidate of the 
Irish 
government, which wants to keep Padraig Flynn in situ as a 
Commissioner in Brussels. But the Irish government accepts that 
if he became a serious contender for the president's job, it 
would have to back him.

<F P=106> [Interview with EC Commissioner Leon Brittan by Fabio </F>
Squillante; place and date not given: "Brittan: If Rome 
Supports Me, Axis With London Will Be Born"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The 12 leaders of the European Union 
[EU] will meet in Corfu on Friday [24 June] to decide, among 
other things, who is to replace Jacques Delors as head of the 
European Commission. One of the leading candidates is Sir Leon 
Brittan, a "heavyweight" of the Commission since 1989. But 
France and Germany oppose him, and Brittan desperately needs 
Italy's support. However, Sir Leon has countered Italy in 
matters ranging from steel to milk, and in 1991 he prevented 
Alenia's purchase of De Havilland and defended the British side. 
Just after the European elections, Brittan rejects his 
anti-Italian label and puts forward his vision of Europe -- a 
union of right-wing forces in parliament, an Italian-British 
axis, and limits on the Commission's decisionmaking powers. 
  [Squillante] The European elections brought losses for the 
Socialists and a fragmentation of the Right, with the entry onto 
the scene of the anti-Europeanists. The only exception to this 
was London. What is your assessment? 
  [Brittan] Your analysis is correct. The Left was weakened, 
but the Right is more fragmented. The Right's capacity to 
resist the Socialists therefore depends on cooperation among its 
various parts. Personally, I am in favor of a rapprochement 
among the groups of the moderate Right -- and I stress, moderate. 
  [Squillante] What role would you assign, as president, to 
the 
Commission? 
  [Brittan] The Commission must respond to public opinion and 
acknowledge that in Europe now those who are unenthusiastic 
about the speed of integration do enjoy some support. We must 
involve the public and national parliaments more and tackle the 
real tasks of EU, without becoming involved in the ordinary 
lives of businesses and individuals. The first problem to tackle 
is unemployment. The second is to extend the Union to the 
countries of Central and East Europe -- and not only them -- 
without causing a slowing of the Union as a result. 
  [Squillante] Without a joint executive, can the governments, 
exposed as they are to changes on the part of the electorate, 
guarantee a continuous leadership of a Europe that will perhaps 
have 20 members in the future? 
  [Brittan] The distinction between intergovernmental and 
Community action was made in the Maastricht Treaty, and it will 
not be substantially modified. With the membership of new 
countries, it will be necessary to give careful attention to all 
the Union's institutions and to consider how they might function 
with 20 or 25 member countries, what changes need to be 
introduced to ensure their proper functioning. 
  [Squillante] [Former French President] Giscard has again 
suggested the idea of a "European president." Can this be 
considered? 
  [Brittan] It is certainly an interesting idea, but I doubt 
whether it could be accepted by everyone. 
  [Squillante] Britain has always advocated a "free trade" 
Europe rather than a federal union. Some people in Rome share 
this philosophy. Is it possible to envisage an Italian-British 
axis? 
  [Brittan] At present there is a broad range of common 
interests, but this was so with previous governments too -- for 
instance, in the negotiations for the Maastricht Treaty and in 
common defense policy. These interests must be supported 
increasingly in other European countries too, and I think that 
Britain's and Italy's ideas will become increasingly important 
in the Europe of the future. 
  [Squillante] Italy will be crucial in the election of the 
president of the Commission, but you have made a reputation for 
yourself as Rome's stubborn adversary... 
  [Brittan] This is not true. Italy is a country to which I 
feel very close, but I draw a distinction between the interests 
of certain sectors of industry and the interests of Italian 
consumers and taxpayers. When I was responsible for competition 
I tried to reduce state aid to industry, which at the time 
constituted 28 percent of your budget deficit. If I had 
succeeded, one of the main financial problems would have been 
considerably reduced, and Italy would have had a better chance 
to share in the single European currency. 
  [Squillante] Pardon me, but Mr. Berlusconi controls a large 
proportion of the advertising and television market and has 
interests in construction, commerce, and finance: Why should he 
support somebody like you, who has adopted free competition as 
his philosophy? 
  [Brittan] I do not want to enter into domestic political 
matters. If anyone thinks that Europe's laws have been 
violated, he must address the Court of Justice and prove it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Delors on Italian </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Brussels, June 21 -- European Commission 
President Jacques Delors said he would be happy to hold a 
bi-lateral meeting with Italy's Premier Silvio Berlusconi at 
this weekend's Corfu summit, but was waiting for Berlusconi to 
propose it. 
  Speaking at a press conference on the Corfu summit, Delors 
said that "being of a rank lower than that of prime minister... 
it is not up to me to propose a meeting, it is up to him. If he 
does so, I would be most happy to hold bi-lateral talks on the 
sidelines of the summit." 
  Delors also dwelt on his recent negative reaction to a 
statement by Gianfranco Fini, leader of Italy's rightist 
National Alliance, who alleged that the American landings in 
Europe in 1944 marked the end of Europe's own cultural identity. 
  Denying that his remarks amounted to interference in Italy's 
domestic affairs, Delors said "if Fini makes statements which I 
believe to be not good or worrying, I respond, and this is a 
dialogue between him and me. I have never judged, and I never 
intend to judge people's intentions, and I do not interfere in 
Italy's domestic affairs." 
  Asked who should head the World Trade Organisation, the body 
which will replace GATT, the EU [European Union] executive chief 
said "there is an Italian candidate, and he certainly has all 
the right qualities for being an excellent director." The 
reference was to Renato Ruggiero, a one-time diplomat and former 
foreign trade minister.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy Unhappy With Milk Quota </F>
Compromise"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Luxembourg, June 21 -- Italy is not 
satisfied with a European Union [EU] compromise document which 
fixes milk quotas and farm prices for the coming season, an 
Italian spokesman said as EU farm ministers met here Tuesday [21 
June] for the second day of their price marathon. 
  "There is confirmation of Italy's production quotas for 
milk, 
but we are not satisfied with proposals on milk derivatives, 
citrus fruit, tobacco, olive oil, beef and rice," said the 
spokesman. 
  In an interview this morning with the Euronews TV channel, 
Italy's Agriculture Minister Adriana Poli Bortone said "there is 
a 50 percent chance that the issue will be brought up at the 
Corfu European Council summit." 
  Italy has threatened to bring the issue up at the summit 
should its demands not be met in the Luxembourg marathon. 
Complicating today's talks, however, is a Greek demand to 
triple its milk quota to 300,000 tonnes a year. The compromise 
document approves Italy's request to hike its quota from nine 
million tonnes to 9.9 million tonnes per year. 
  "We don't want to be perpetually subjected to the blackmail 
of the milk quotas," Poli Bortone told her colleagues here. 
"Italy has recognised the mistakes it made on the quotas, and 
now it does not want to be judged for a sort of original sin," 
she said. 
  The minister described the situation as "unsustainable" 
given 
that Italy is only 60 percent self-sufficient in milk and 
imports around 9 million metric tons each year. 
  Poli Bortone pointed out that "our requests on future prices 
and measures to manage markets are all zero-cost," regarding 
tobacco, rice, olive oil, beef, citrus fruits, and the famous 
cheeses of the Po valley like parmigiano and grana. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by John Carvel: "Britain Watches as EU 11 Act on </F>
Workers' Rights"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg -- Britain was in a spectator role 
yesterday when ministers from the other European Union [EU] 
member states legislated for the first time under the Maastricht 
social protocol to increase the rights of workers in 
multinational companies. 
  With David Hunt, the Employment Secretary, sitting out 
because of the British opt-out, they approved a directive to 
establish European works councils in transnational companies 
with at least 1,000 employees in the community outside Britain. 
  The law is designed to ensure that workers are consulted 
about strategic corporate decisions which could affect their 
livelihood, such as changing technology, shifts in production 
from one country to another, or large-scale redundancies. 
  Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, said the 
decision was an historic breakthrough after 23 years of 
argument. He claimed the law could improve the competitiveness 
of business by strengthening its most important asset -- good 
relations between managements and their staff. 
  "We have reaffirmed in a dramatic way the commitment of 
member states to maintain social progress at the same time as 
other policies," he said. 
  But Mr Hunt said the decision to establish "trade-union 
dominated works councils" was a dreadful mistake which would 
"impose unnecessary costs and bureaucracy on companies at a time 
when the overwhelming need is to reduce costs and increase 
employment." The measure was opposed by every employers group 
in Europe, he said. 
  Up to 100 of the largest British-based multinationals might 
be affected by the legislation because they have more than 1,000 
employees in the EU outside Britain and meet the threshold of at 
least 150 in two or more of the other 11 member states. 
  They will be obliged to set up works councils for their 
continental and Irish employees. "But they will be free to 
decide for themselves what arrangements they have for consulting 
and informing their staff in Britain," Mr Hunt said. 
  He presented this as a benefit of the opt-out, but this 
interpretation was disputed by Norbert Blum, the German labour 
minister, who said: "Modern entrepreneurs must have a system of 
informing their employees if they are going to make headway. 
This is all about motivation and we can't have the standards of 
the last century." 
  Mr Flynn said the evidence from company boardrooms was that 
they intended to apply the directive right throughout the EU. 
"De jure this legislation covers the 11, de facto it will be 
applied across the 12," he said. 
  He estimated that 1,500 multinationals would be affected in 
the EU as a whole, of which 15 to 100 would be based in Britain. 
  John Monks, general secretary of the TUC [Trade Union 
Council], said yesterday: "I regret the British government 
opt-out means some British workers will be denied rights that 
obtain elsewhere, but I am confident that many of the 
British-based companies concerned will take the sensible course 
and apply the same provisions to their British operations." 
  The legislation agreed yesterday is expected to pass through 
the European Parliament in September and to receive a second and 
final approval from the Council of Ministers before the end of 
the year. The 11 member states then have up to two years to 
transpose it into their national law. 
  The directive is designed to encourage managements to agree 
arrangements with their trade unions for consulting employees in 
the way which best suits the style of the business. Its 
legislative bite lies in a fall-back procedure which imposes 
works council machinery if these negotiations fail. 
  On a proposal from the French government, the allowable 
negotiating period was extended from two to three years. This 
means no compulsory machinery can be established before the year 
2000, but Mr Flynn believes there is now the incentive for firms 
to start negotiating immediately. 
  Another amendment approved yesterday was to restrict the 
legislation to firms with at least 150 employees in two or more 
member states, instead of 100. 
  The social affairs council gave final approval for a 
directive to prevent the exploitation of young workers, 
including a controversial exemption to allow 14 and 15-year-olds 
in Britain to continue to work more than 12 hours a week. 
  Mr Hunt said this was a "UK opt-out" which would protect 
British schoolchildren's traditional right to earn pocket money 
by delivering newspapers and gaining work experience from a few 
hours work at weekends. 
  Mr Flynn said there was a temporary concession, but no 
opt-out. Britain would have to legislate to comply with the 
directive within the next six years because the exemption would 
automatically expire unless the European Commission proposed its 
renewal, which it would never contemplate.

<F P=106> [Report by Owen Bowcott: "Loyalists Use Savagery as </F>
Political Weapon"] 
  [Text] The pools of blood mingled with beer on the floor 
of O'Toole's bar is further evidence that the hard core of 
Northern Ireland's working-class loyalists is increasingly 
alienated and ready to resort to acts of savagery. 
  Protestants are convinced they have most to lose from the 
Downing Street declaration, and loyalist hardliners believe the 
IRA has proved that violence gains polltical advantage. 
  The result has been a surge in loyalist killings. Peace, 
seen through the distorted logic of paramilitary calculations, 
equals war. Despite the declaration's promises of 
reconciliation, paramilitary gunmen have killed 10 more people 
in the province in 1994 compared with the same period last year. 
  The rise reflects, in part, the volatility caused by the 
resurgence of the INLA [Irish National Liberation Army], which 
has concentrated more in recent months on retaliatory attacks on 
loyalists. Underlying such shifts in republican paramilitary 
tactics, however, is the fundamental alienation of the loyalist 
community. Their sense of betrayal was sharpened by the 
Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, which formally gave Dublin a 
consultative role in the affairs of Northern Ireland. 
  Much of the current loyalist paranoia is also linked to the 
growing fear that the Catholics' higher birth rate will soon 
undermine Protestant numerical dominance of Northern Ireland's 
six counties. 
  The results of the 1991 census appeared to reinforce such 
anxieties. Catholics were estimated as forming between 41 and 
43 per cent of Northern Ireland. That represented a 
considerable advance on the figures of 10 years' earlier, when 
many republicans refused to take part in the headcount. 
  Proof that such calculations feature prominently in the 
loyalist paramilitary imagination came earlier this year with 
the release of a doomsday plan for repartition to ensure a 
permanent Protestant majority. 
  Using maps published 10 years ago as part of an academic 
study on political options for the province, the UDA [Ulster 
Defense Association] suggested the establishment of an 
ethnically-cleansed Protestant homeland, which would involve the 
surrender of the equivalent of least two counties to the Irish 
Republic. 
  Although the plan chillingly contemplated "expulsion, 
lnternment or nullification" of those Catholics on the Wrong 
side of the redrawn borders, the Democratic Unionist Party 
leader, Ian Paisley MP, welcomed it as a "very valuable return 
to reality." 
  The document also exposed class divisions. Hardline loyalism 
is predominantly the creed of an impoverished Protestant working 
class, which feels isolated in its ghettoes. "Sinn Fein's 
theory that a last-minute deal can be put together with the 
middle and upper Protestant classes should not be ignored," the 
report warned. "lt does have validity." 
  Anecdotal evidence of Protestant farmers being shot or 
intimidated out of their land along the border in Fermanagh and 
Armagh is also persuasive. 
  The result has been a growing conviction that neither the 
Government, police or army can be relied upon to deal with the 
republican menace. Clashes between the authorites and loyalist 
paramilitaries have become more frequent and violent in recent 
years. 
  Earlier this month, the UVF [Ulster Volunteer Force] 
threatened to extend its paramilitary campaign to the British 
mainland for the first time. Its targets would be republican 
activists and Irish officials living in London. 
  John Hume MP, leader of the predominantly Catholic Social 
Democratic and Labour Party, claimed his increased vote in the 
European elections was proof of growing support for the peace 
process and the Downing Street declaration. 
  The immediate evidence of Saturday night [18 June], however, 
lends greater support to those Unionist leaders who have been 
sounding alarmist warnings that the province is slipping slowly 
into civil war.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Articles of Poor Faith"] </F>
  [Text] The remarks made by Albert Reynolds in yesterday's 
IRISH TIMES about the constitutional relationship between Ulster 
and the Republic of Ireland were grimly overshadowed by the 
funerals of the six Catholics shot dead by Loyalist 
paramilitaries on Saturday [18 June]. The brutality of the 
Loughinisland massacre -- which claimed the life of an 
87-year-old man watching the World Cup on television -- will not 
be quickly forgotten. Yet the Taoiseach's [Irish Prime 
Minister] words were no less symbolic of the problems that face 
the province than the pall-bearers' march. 
  In the interview, Mr Reynolds demanded a cross-border 
authority in return for rescinding Articles 2 and 3 of the 1937 
Irish constitution which assert the Republics historic claim to 
the North. He and his deputy, Dick Spring, have always made 
clear that the constitution would be changed only in the context 
of a broader settlement. Yesterday the Taoiseach came closer to 
spelling out the conditions which the South would try to exact 
from the British Government and the Unionist community. He 
expected "institutional links between North and South" which -- 
crucially -- would have "executive powers." Though still vague, 
this demand moves far beyond the existing structures of 
Anglo-lrish diplomacy and cross- border co-operation. It would 
involve major amendment of the 1920 Government of Ireland Act. 
  This proposed bargain should be rejected by British 
ministers. Articles 2 and 3, which were recently declared a 
"constitutional imperative" by the Irish Supreme Court, are an 
outrageous anachronism rather than a legitimate bargaining chip. 
For Ireland to claim territorial rights over part of another 
European Union member state also makes a mockery of its 
high-minded aspirations as a European nation. There can be no 
question of a deal in which Eamon de Valera's articles were 
dropped in return for the partial transfer of executive power in 
the North to Dublin. 
  Joint authority, in any case, is the least satisfactory of 
the various constitutional options open to Ulster. Its 
superficial attractions are obvious, particularly to a 
generation of politicians and diplomats who have grown used to 
the institutions set up by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and to the 
meetings of the British-lrish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Under a 
system of joint authority, the Republic would not have to 
shoulder the entire cost of the province but would assume a veto 
over all key decisions in the North. The British Government 
would be able to claim that it had responded to nationalist 
demands for self-determination without abandoning the Unionist 
community. 
  In practice, such a system would stand little chance of 
succeeding. The blurring of sovereignty would create more 
problems than it solved. The Unionist parties would be very 
unlikely to participate in any administrative structures which 
gave Dublin "executive power." Though the constitutional 
nationalist parties would welcome joint authority, the IRA would 
regard it as only a staging-post on the way to reunification. 
For the same reason, Loyalist violence would probably increase. 
Run by fractious committees, the province might soon become 
ungovernable. 
  The deal set out by Mr Reynolds yesterday epitomises the 
delusions of Anglo-lrish diplomacy in the past nine years. In 
the wake of the weekend s murders, it should be clear that 
constitutional horse-trading between London and Dublin is no 
solution to the suffering of Ulster. Imaginative security 
measures and swift devolutionary reform would contribute far 
more than the spent rhetoric of the Downing Street declaration. 
Six months on, the refusal of the two governments to recognise 
the need for a change of strategy is no longer excusable.

  [Text] Bonn -- The cabinet, chaired by Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, laid down objectives and priorities for the German 
European Union [EU] presidency on Wednesday [22 June]. According 
to Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel, the cabinet also adopted 
the Berlin-Bonn Law and compensatory measures for the Bonn 
region. 
  As compensation for the parliament and government's move to 
Berlin, Bonn will be allocated 2.81 billion German marks [DM]. 
The agreement on funding Berlin as capital, which was initialed 
last week, provides for DM1.3 billion in funds to pay for 
infrastructure over a 10-year period. 
  The Cabinet also agreed to provide 50 trucks as material 
help 
to the United Nations for its peacekeeping efforts in former 
Yugoslavia. In addition, Germany will send 16 experts to the 
Bosnian airport of Tuzla, where relief flights are to land once 
it has been reopened. The Bundeswehr also wants to participate 
in these flights when the airport is reopened. Furthermore, 70 
police officers will be sent to the city of Mostar as part of a 
civilian action. Mostar is the city where Hans Koschnick 
(Social Democratic Party of Germany), the former mayor of Bremen 
is acting as EU administrator.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- With Germany and France, Italy will 
contribute to the development of the European Armament Agency 
with equal rights right from the beginning. This was agreed by 
FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) 
and Italian Defense Minister Cesare Previti (Forza Italia) in 
Bonn on Tuesday [21 June]. French Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard, who had arrived on the previous evening, also agreed to 
it, Previti said at a joint news conference with Ruehe. Both 
ministers welcomed Russia's signing of the NATO Partnership for 
Peace, planned for this Wednesday in Brussels, as a "historic 
event." 
  Ruehe paid tribute to Italy's cooperation in the development 
of the European Armament Agency. "There is still a very long 
way to go. What matters is who advances things," he said. 
Major armament projects can no longer be carried out on a 
national level. Germany and France have already cooperated very 
closely in standardizing armament systems, above all by their 
joint Eurocorps. Previti said that Berlusconi's government 
insists on Italy bringing more authority to bear in this respect. 
  He is convinced that in the next few months an international 
task force will be formed by Italy, France, and Spain. Then it 
will be possible to employ it within the framework of NATO or 
the Western European Union. Referring to Italy's possible 
participation in a military action in Rwanda, Previti affirmed 
Italy's known position: Italy will wait for the UN decision and 
then decide. The condition is an international supreme command 
and a humanitarian objective. Italy will not participate in 
France's individual actions. 
  During his first visit to Bonn, Previti was received with 
military honors. Ruehe paid tribute to the good cooperation 
exhibited during the first German UN mission in Somalia.

  [Text] Bonn -- According to Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, 
the European countries must cooperate more closely in the field 
of armaments. At a hearing of representatives from the German 
arms industry, Ruehe said in the Bundestag Defense Committee on 
Thursday [23 June] that in view of the armed forces in Europe 
becoming increasingly multinational, it is neither sensible nor 
worthwhile for states to make single-handed efforts at equipping 
their armies with modern material. The minister demanded that 
minimum capacities be preserved in the German defense industry. 
  Ludolf von Wartenberg, the main manager of the Federal 
Association of German Industry (BDI), demanded that the arms 
industry be given security of planning and a "clear 
orientation." The committee agreed that a "defense technology 
basis" must be preserved in Germany. Ruehe pointed out that the 
German arms industry must maintain its capacities for the 
construction of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, submarines, for 
the production of modern ammunition, and in the field of 
electronics for modern weapons. 
  The minister said Europe simply cannot afford several 
competing weapons systems of the future generation. All 
countries need fewer and different weapons, and they have less 
money and over capacities in the arms industry. According to 
Ruehe, almost 100,000 people in Germany have lost their jobs in 
the arms industry since the beginning of this decade. The 
current employment figure of some 140,000 could be further 
reduced by 30,000 to 40,000. 
  In order to keep the Bundeswehr modern and operational, a 
sound relationship between operating costs and investment is 
necessary, Ruehe emphasized. The share of investments in the 
defense budget, which has dropped to almost 20 percent, must be 
increased toward 30 percent again. The German armed forces must 
cut down on personnel costs and use all possibilities of 
rationalization. The crisis reaction forces must be given 
priority with equipment. The deficit is to be removed gradually 
in this field, Ruehe said.

  [Text] Berlin -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has 
called for a revitalization of the traditionally good economic 
relations with Saudi Arabia. According to the prereleased text 
of his speech held at the opening of the two-day conference of 
the bilateral economic commission in Berlin on Thursday [23 
June], Rexrodt told Saudi Economics and Finance Minister Shaykh 
Muhammad al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl that he hopes to get some 
information on future cooperation opportunities. The 
commission, which was established in 1975, held its last meeting 
in Riyadh in late February 1992. The conference will end in 
Potsdam on Friday with the signing of a final protocol. 
  Rexrodt said he regrets that German investment in Saudi 
Arabia is still very modest in volume and that it has not gone 
up over the past few years. The reasons for this are not only 
to be sought in Germany. Creating favorable conditions for 
investment is also important for Saudi Arabia, Rexrodt said. 
  Rexrodt went on to express concern over the fact that German 
exports to Saudi Arabia dropped by almost 15 percent in 1993, 
while German imports only went down 1.1 percent. German exports 
were at a high of 8.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1982. In 
1993, the figure was DM3.6 billion. Imports from Saudi Arabia 
amounted to some DM2 billion in 1993. The main products 
imported were petroleum, fuels, and lubricating oil. 
  According to the Saudi Industrial Ministry, there are some 
70 
German-Saudi joint ventures. The German Society for Technical 
Cooperation (GTZ) has arranged for over 100 experts to provide 
training and consultation for Saudi institutions. Cooperation 
in science and technology concentrates on the use of solar 
energy for hydrogen production.

  [Text] Halle (DPA) -- According to Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union), Germany needs a 
performance elite. Without such an elite, the country can have 
no future, Kohl said. "We need initiative, responsibility, the 
courage to undertake ventures, the readiness to make personal 
sacrifices, and patience in pursuing great goals," the 
chancellor said at the annual meeting of the German Research 
Community (DFG) in Halle on 21 June. 
  Even though Germany was holding an international top 
position 
in important fields of research, it had lost ground in 
competition, which had become sharper on the world markets. 
Kohl said that research results should, therefore, be put into 
practice more swiftly. "In the research laboratories and 
scientific institutions of today, decisions are made on our jobs 
of tomorrow," he told an audience of approximately 500 
scientists and guests of honor at the DFG festive meeting. 
  The chancellor said that in the important areas of high 
technology and biotechnology, industry largely depended on the 
swift and smooth transfer of research results. To this end, 
borders had to be more permeable. In addition, more joint 
ventures between industry and research and a closer dialogue 
with broad sections of the population were required. The 
country of poets and thinkers should not become a country of 
doubters and hesitaters, said Kohl. 
  His most important concern was to increase and improve the 
dialogue between industry, science, and the state. Kohl said 
that, without intending to patronize research, he held the view 
that its structures had to be reviewed. They had to be revised 
where they had become entrenched and were dominated by thinking 
in terms of entitlements. 
  The chancellor struck a favorable balance on the development 
of universities and research in the new laender. He said they 
corresponded to international standards and compared well with 
facilities in the new laender. Kohl stressed that the 
universities in eastern Germany could stimulate the renewal of 
the university system throughout Germany. 
  Earlier, DFG President Professor Wolfgang Fruehwald was 
unanimously confirmed in office for another three years. With 
its meeting in Halle, the German Research Community paid tribute 
to Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, which 
celebrates its 300th anniversary this year.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl has 
rejected employers' demands for social cuts as well as drastic 
cuts in the social network. In the SAT-1 program "Let's Get 
Down to Business, Chancellor," Kohl said on Wednesday [22 June] 
that he does not at all share the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl, 
president of the German Industrial and Trade Association (DIHT), 
who had advocated drastic social cuts, among other things. 
Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of Employers' 
Associations, had taken up this demand and suggested cuts in the 
social benefits for welfare recipients who are able to work. 
  In the television program, however, Kohl advocated that 
abuse 
and the "propagation" of social benefits "according to the pork 
barrel principle" be eliminated. Social benefits are reserved 
for those who are really poor, Kohl said. His proposal to 
introduce more part-time work must not be misunderstood as a 
panacea for the elimination of unemployment. The chancellor 
advocated that apprentices immediately get a part-time job after 
they have concluded their training if it is not possible to 
immediately employ them permanently. 
  Kohl promised to reconsider the 20-percent investment 
allowance for enterprises owned by former GDR citizens. It is 
conceivable for him that this allowance will not be completely 
abolished, but it might be degressively shaped. 
  The chancellor explicitly paid tribute to the attitude of 
the 
employers and trade unions when the latest collective 
negotiations were concluded. "In the past few weeks, we 
received very wise and reasonable collective agreements," he 
said. After an economic decline, there is "a tendency" toward 
an upswing. Moreover, he expects an increase in the gross 
national product that exceeds the forecast of 1.5 percent.

  [Text] Weimar (DPA) -- The Bundestag Group chairmen of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] and the Christian Social Union 
[CSU] have called on the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] federal party congress in Halle "to dissociate itself 
clearly from cooperation with the Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS] at all levels." In a statement by the Bundestag Group 
Chairmen's Conference in Weimar on Tuesday [21 June], the 
successor organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany 
[SED] is called extreme-left and a danger to democracy. The 
chiefs of the CDU and CSU groups demanded that political action 
be taken against the PDS with all democratic means. 
  The declaration, which was unanimously adopted in Weimar, 
says that the PDS has to be combated in the same way as the 
extreme-right Republikaner. The SPD is particularly requested 
to do this. "It is part of the SPD's historical omissions that 
it does not dissociate itself from extreme-left forces clearly 
enough." The SPD merger with the Communist Party of Germany 
into the SED in eastern Germany in April 1946 had disastrous 
consequences for many upright Social Democrats, it was stated.

  [Text] Halle (DPA) -- The Presidium of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] on Tuesday [21 June] met in 
Halle to prepare for the extraordinary SPD congress. Headed by 
SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, the party leaders want to set the 
final course for the one-day congress on Wednesday. 
  Before the meeting, leading Social Democrats expressed the 
conviction that the party congress will put the SPD on the 
offensive again after the defeat at the European elections. 
Chairman Scharping, who is to be officially elected as the 
SPD's candidate for the chancellor's office in Halle, will be 
strengthened for entering the conflict with Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen. "I expect the 
party congress to give a strong signal that we accept the 
challenges and dare a new beginning for a policy of reforms and 
renewal." The European election is over; the struggle for the 
majority in the Federal Government is starting only now. 
  The party leadership also expects with excitement 
Scharping's 
speech on Wednesday, with which he wants to motivate the SPD 
again for the struggle for the change in government in Bonn. In 
addition to Scharping's election, the approximately 500 
delegates intend to adopt a government program. If the party 
leadership has its way, a coalition debate will be avoided at 
any cost, even though delegates have announced motions for an 
alliance with the Greens. 
  After the Presidium meeting, the Executive Committee and the 
Party Council will meet in Halle in the afternoon. In the 
evening, the SPD top politicians plan to intervene in the 
Landtag election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt by holding several 
rallies. A new parliament will be elected there next Sunday.

  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- According to Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenter 
Verheugen, "Kohl" belongs "in a museum." The population cannot 
be expected to bear another four years of Kohl. The SPD is 
missing its historical task if it does not manage to bring about 
a change of power in the autumn because of its own problems. 
"Attack is the command of the hour. Up and at 'em!" Verheugen 
said during the discussion. 
  Thomas Westphal, chairman of the Young Socialists, openly 
came out in favor of committing the party to a red-green 
coalition, but he remained clearly in the minority with this 
proposal. Brandenburg Social Affairs Minister Regine 
Hildebrandt said it is incomprehensible and unacceptable that 
many people in the east still vote for Helmut Kohl, despite all 
the social cutbacks imposed by the coalition. 
  [Lower Saxony Minister President] Schroeder stated that, 
with 
its new program, the SPD has a good basis to win the Bundestag 
elections. After the "failure of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany," the SPD must make sure that it does not give up 
liberal principles in domestic policy and that it does not fall 
into the trap of FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther's rigid 
ideological concepts.

  [Text] Halle -- Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has sworn his party in for a change of 
power at the Bundestag elections in October. "We want to win. 
I am not counting on a place, but on victory," Scharping said 
in his policy statement at the special party conference in Halle 
on Wednesday [22 June]. 
  The Social Democrats are prepared to take on government 
responsibility again. To achieve this aim, the SPD will have to 
make an effort during the next few months. "The change will not 
come about automatically; it has to be fought for." After the 
disappointing results of the European elections, all Social 
Democrats must realize that they have to fight with even more 
clarity and determination. "You cannot look ahead if you hang 
your head," he told the 500 delegates in Halle. 
  Scharping said that directions will be decided at the 
Bundestag election. "The decision will be whether wariness, 
lack of solidarity, and irresponsibility will keep spreading 
like mildew, or whether the opportunity for change is used to 
return to reason and tolerance." Scharping accused the Federal 
Government of having changed the social climate through 
selfishness and recklessness. A strong Social Democratic force 
is also necessary to ward off nationalism and right-wing 
extremism, Scharping said. 
  He said he is sure that Chancellor Kohl's policy of "going 
on 
the same way as ever" cannot be sustained until October. A big 
majority in unified Germany wants to see a change toward new 
politics. This is only possible with an SPD-led government. 
Instead of a coalition debate, the SPD has to conduct a reform 
debate. "We will counteract conservative restoration with a 
policy of reforms. To achieve this, we are looking for wide 
alliances with all groups of our society." 
  He cannot promise that a government led by him will 
immediately solve all problems, said Scharping, who is to be 
elected candidate for chancellor at the end of the one-day party 
conference. "But we promise that we will give the people 
courage again, we will strengthen the feeling of solidarity, and 
open politics to reforms." An SPD government will immediately 
embark upon cutting unemployment step by step. It will not 
increase the tax burden and lower taxes and rates in those 
fields where they impair growth and employment. The SPD will 
make sure that the unconstitutional taxation of the minimum 
subsistence level will be stopped as of 1996 and that a child 
benefit of 250 marks is paid for each child. 
  Another priority of an SPD government will be an ecological 
modernization of industry. This will require a tax reform that 
promotes environment-friendly measures and levies taxes on 
behavior that harms the environment. The SPD will maintain its 
objective of withdrawing from nuclear energy in the medium term. 
Scharping warned against leaving the competence in 
environmental matters to the Greens. The welfare state must 
also be restabilized. The welfare state is not "the ambulance" 
of society, but a clear constitutional mandate, Scharping said.

  [Text] Halle (DPA) -- New DGB [German Trade Union 
Federation] Chairman Dieter Schulte has harshly criticized the 
Federal Government's policy. Never before have there been so 
many social welfare recipients and unemployed in Germany, he 
said on Wednesday [22 June] in a speech at the Social Democratic 
Party [SPD] congress in Halle. The country will not be able to 
bear this course in the long run, a change is urgently 
necessary, he said. 
  He appealed to the Social Democrats to struggle with the 
trade unions against further social cuts. Schulte offered a 
close dialogue to the Social Democrats. The SPD government 
program forms an "excellent basis" for such a dialogue. Schulte 
credited SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping with having committed the 
party to important priorities of Social Democratic policy. The 
SPD chief will find fair partners in the DGB, he said. 
  In another speech Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's Social 
Democratic head of government, stressed that her party stands 
side by side with the German Social Democrats. As common goals 
she cited full employment in Europe and a just world order. 
That is why one needs strong Social Democrats in Germany, she 
stressed. 
  Reinhard Hoeppner, the SPD's top candidate for the Landtag 
elections in Saxony-Anhalt, expressed optimism that his party 
will achieve a good result on Sunday. This will also provide 
support to the Social Democrats for the Bundestag elections on 
16 October, he said, speaking to 500 delegates. Hoeppner 
accused Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) of 
having turned the stroke of luck of unification into a problem 
case with his "disastrous policy." 
  The delegates unanimously adopted proposals by the east 
German SPD for an immediate program for the first 100 days of an 
SPD-led federal government. The focus is special protective 
measures for tenants, pensioners, and farmers in the former GDR.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Because of opposition opinions within 
the coalition, it has become questionable whether the 
constitutional reform that has been prepared in years of work 
will actually be passed before the Bundestag election. This 
became clear on Tuesday [21 June], following the coalition 
meeting chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The second and third 
reading of a reform package to amend the Basic Law was scheduled 
for next Thursday in the Berlin Reichstag. 
  As has been learned, there are disagreements between the 
Christian Democratic Union /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and 
the Free Democratic Party [FDP] in particular about the 
expansion of powers for the laender. There is also disagreement 
about the acceptance of minority protection and equal rights for 
married and unmarried couples as well as the current form of 
animal protection. On the other hand, there is no dispute about 
including the protection for handicapped people in the 
constitution. 
  According to CDU/CSU circles, the FDP is calling for an 
entire package of measures and opposes adopting those individual 
points that are not disputed between the coalition parties. 
This makes the situation difficult, the CDU/CSU group leaders 
said. From the CSU, it was heard that under these circumstances 
it might become difficult to achieve a decision at the Berlin 
Bundestag session next week. The strengthening of the laenders' 
rights, which they want, might be postponed to the next 
legislative period.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Martino on Foreign Policy"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 21 -- European monetary union 
cannot be achieved in phases, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio 
Martino warned here today in testimony to the Lower House 
Foreign Affairs Committee in which he also urged the European 
Union nations to avoid haste in naming a successor to European 
Commission President Jacques Delors. 
  In a wide-ranging foreign policy briefing in the run-up to 
the EU's [European Union] Corfu summit and the G-7 summit in 
Naples on July 8-10, he also said that he would be seeking to 
give Italy a higher-profile foreign policy. 
  Other points in the briefing included a proposal to debate 
the Bosnian crisis at the G-7 summit where he said he hoped to 
see an acceleration in Russian involvement. Bosnia, said 
Martino, "can usefully be brought into the sphere of political 
cooperation in the G-7 plus Russia, not only at the summit 
itself, but as an appropriate forum for permanent political 
consultation." 
  On the EU's plans for economic and monetary union, Martino 
said that he sees the present procedures introduced to achieve 
the economic convergence needed to create a common currency as 
"excessively laborious and potentially ineffective, especially 
where they don't take account of the deeper logic of market 
forces." Monetary union, he added, would have to be based on a 
monetary constitution to be put into effect "instantaneously" by 
all the participants: "Put simply, if you want a single currency 
for Europe, it will have to be achieved at one go." 
  These apparent criticisms of one proposed aspect of European 
integration were matched by arguments advanced by Martino in 
support of submitting some joint EU policies more systematically 
to the winds of global competition, a development already under 
way for the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP], whose subsidies 
are to be largely dismantled under the Uruguay Round. 
  In Corfu, Martino urged, the EU leaders should decide on 
ways 
of achieving lower costs by opening Europe to competition from 
the rest of the world. He also claimed that the CAP had 
favoured rich farmers and middle-men. In similar points, he 
said supplementary EU funding for infrastructural and other 
projects outlined in the Delors White Paper should not distort 
the European capital market nor create additional expense for 
the EU budget. 
  Looking forward to a common European foreign policy, the 
Italian diplomatic chief urged the creation of a new institution 
on the lines of the European Commission, "with the power to make 
proposals to the political authorities and the means to execute 
and maintain actions." 
  In other foreign policy areas, Martino reiterated that Italy 
has "no territorial demands" against Slovenia or Croatia and 
that ongoing negotiations should resolve remaining bilateral 
questions such as minority rights and compensation for 
confiscated property. He also said that Rome favours Slovenia's 
gradual movement towards its goal of membership in the EU, but 
urged it to adopt an "open and constructive" attitude towards 
Italy's legitimate expectations, "in line with EU principles." 
In particular, he said Italy is demanding free access to the 
Slovenian real-estate market for Italians born in ex-Italian 
territories now forming part of Slovenia, in line with EU 
regulations on free circulation. He said he expected similar 
solutions with Croatia. The diplomatic chief then added how 
Rome favored Slovenia moving "slowly" closer to the European 
Union in pace with Ljubljana meeting Italy's legitimate demands 
which "are based on Community principals," such as open markets 
and free circulation. 
  As to the naming of a new Commission president, Martino said 
that all the present candidates have the political 
qualifications to become "potentially excellent presidents," but 
he also repeated the view that the appointment should form part 
of an agreement on the whole package of international 
appointments now falling due. 
  Among these are the candidacy of ex-Foreign Trade Minister 
Renato Ruggiero to head the new World Trade Organisation, which 
will succeed the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. "We 
are examining this question in all its ramifications," said 
Martino. He also linked the issue of international appointments 
to his moves to give Italy a more high-profile foreign policy, 
which he said must be "coherent and recognisable" to be credible. 
  Saying that domestic uncertainties had meant a loss in 
international prestige, he said the government would be seeking 
to rebuild Italian participation in international 
decision-making processes by "making the most" of its current 
duty presidencies and working for a two-year stint on the UN 
Security Council. This, he said, now looks a virtual certainty 
because Sweden has withdrawn its candidacy and because of the 
"assurances we have received." 
  On Rwanda, Martino voiced the hope that a joint action plan 
would be adopted in Corfu and said that Italy was ready to play 
its part, even through the use of its armed forces. He also 
warned that, if two European countries -- for example, Italy and 
France -- were to intervene instead of the UN as a whole, the 
operation would be seen as "neo-colonialism." 
  In other points, he reiterated Italy's plan to use the G-7 
summit as a forum for proposing the creation of a small rapid 
intervention force -- "a small task force," he specified -- for 
immediate intervention in small crises. Looking at the costs of 
Italy's participation in international operations, Martino said 
the time had come for the budget to include ad hoc allocations 
for peace-keeping expenses. 
  Martino's foreign policy briefing also included reference to 
his recent meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
who he said was totally satisfied over the political evolution 
in Italy and confirmed the traditionally excellent relations 
between Italy and Israel.

  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 22 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino will carry out a mission to Sarajevo, Zagreb and 
Belgrade on June 27-28 to further Italian efforts to achieve a 
peaceful settlement in former Yugoslavia, the Foreign Ministry 
announced this evening. 
  Martino will be the second Italian foreign minister to 
travel 
to Sarajevo since the start of the Bosnian war. Emilio Colombo 
visited on February 3, 1993, meeting with UN commanders and 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic after talks in Zagreb with 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  Martino's trip will come after the Corfu EU [European Union] 
summit and before the Naples G-7 summit, two occasions on which 
Bosnia will be one of the top agenda items.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda: Martino on Conditions for </F>
Sending Troops"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, June 22 -- Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino, speaking during a break in a Senate Foreign 
Affairs Committee hearing this morning, specified the conditions 
under which this country would consider sending troops to an 
international peace force to Rwanda. 
  The United Nations would have to vote a request for peace 
keeping forces under the command of the Western European Union 
[WEU] or of NATO, Martino said. And to guarantee that force's 
effectiveness, it would have to be based on an accord among the 
national forces being deployed, the Foreign Minister added. 
  "Under those conditions we may even consider sending troops, 
but if those conditions do not hold, we will end up with a 
unilateral initiative," Martino added. 
  The decision taken Monday [20 June] by the WEU in Brussels 
to 
send French troops backed by "logistical support" on the part of 
Great Britain, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg "is a move in the 
right direction," the Foreign Minister said. 
  "It involves international coordination, which gives us the 
guarantee this is not a unilateral initiative but a multilateral 
effort that puts the emphasis on the humanitarian aspect of the 
mission," he told reporters, adding he thought it was possible 
the WEU-sponsored mission "could put an end to the massacres." 
  "What we were worried about was a unilateral move that would 
have had a neocolonialist flavor and would have aggravated 
rather than reduced tensions." 
  The Italian government had urged the broadest possible 
participation among WEU nations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Defense Minister </F>
Asked To Appear Before Senate"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 23 -- The chairman of the Senate 
foreign affairs committee, Raffaelle Bertoni of the opposition 
Progressive group, has requested that Defense Minister Cesare 
Previti respond first to parliament before any decisions are 
made concerning the eventual deployment of Italian troops in any 
mission in Rwanda. 
  "The government must inform Parliament before any decision 
is 
made on a military intervention in Rwanda" he said, adding "this 
is the only seat where the (mission) objectives can be fully 
examined as well as the risks for our troops which could derive 
from decisions made in haste or without due reflection." 
  "Thus Minister Previti, who for some time has promised to 
illustrate to the Senate defense committee the guidelines of his 
policy" Senator Bertoni added, "should now quickly fulfill this 
commitment, to communicate the government's intentions regarding 
the conflict in Rwanda." 
  "It is inadmissible" he concluded, "that Parliament must be 
limited to only information relayed through the media and not 
put in the position to express its views on such an important 
question through a meeting with the minister." 
  Defense Minister Cesare Previti confirmed later that Italy 
could participate in an eventual humanitarian mission on the 
condition that it be multi-national and for peaceful purposes. 
  Speaking to the press before entering a cabinet meeting, the 
minister told the press how such a multi-national peace mission 
would have to be commanded by an authority which was above any 
national level or interest. 
  Italy, Previti added, "is taking part in diplomatic 
negotiations" for such a solution and that his defense minister 
was raising no objection to such a project. 
  The United Nations Security Council last night gave its 
green 
light to a French-led humanitarian mission. 
  Opposition Progressive groups in both the Senate and the 
House have asked that Previti appear in their competent 
committees to illustrate the new defense model. In a joint 
statement issued today, Senate Progressive whip Cesare Salvi and 
House whip Luigi Berlinguer and the respective committee 
chairmen Loreto and Ruffino, also asked that the matter also be 
subject to a floor debate. 
  The Progressives went on to point out how the new government 
has been in power for some six weeks and has yet to illustrate 
its policies to parliament for discussion. "This becomes even 
more subject to criticism" they stated, "given that during the 
confidence debate the government dealt with security and defense 
policies in a generic and brief way." 
  In reference to statements made by Previti on Rwanda, the 
Progressives underscored how "Even on such topics the minister 
did not feel it was opportune to inform the parliament committee 
of his intentions. Such behavior is not adapted to our 
parliamentary democracy."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Patriotic Front </F>
Warns Italy on Intervention"] 
  [Excerpt] (ANSA) Brussels, June 23 -- The Rwandan Patriotic 
Front, the armed Tutsi opposition in Rwanda, has warned Italy 
against participating in the French-led intervention in that 
African country. 
  "If Italy, as it would appear, does send 400 men to 
reinforce 
the French invaders, then it will do so on its own risk," Jam 
Rwego, a spokesman for the Patriotic Front said here on Thursday 
[23 June]. 
  "In any case," he added, "Italy must make certain that the 
aim of the French intervention is truly and uniquely 
humanitarian. Should this not be the case, we will be forced to 
consider the Italian soldiers as enemies with all the military 
consequences this would apply." 
  Italy has yet to make an official decision on whether to 
join 
the French-led effort which was given a green light by the 
United Nations Security council last night. The conditions 
which the Rome government has set for Italy's eventual 
participation include that the mission be only for humanitarian 
purposes, that the command be above any national interest and 
that other nations also take part, especially from Africa.

<F P=106> [Report signed VF/JR: "Bern Adheres to the UN Sanctions </F>
Against Haiti -- Switzerland Will Enforce an Extensive Trade 
Embargo"] 
  [Excerpt] Bern, 23 Jun (ATS) -- Bern has decided to 
implement the new UN sanctions against Haiti that entered into 
force on 22 May. The federal counselor approved an extensive 
trade embargo and restrictions in the field of air and maritime 
transportation. These measures add up to those already taken by 
Switzerland on 30 June 1993. They enter into force on Thursday 
[23 June]. 
  In addition, the individuals who took part in the 1991 coup 
d'etat as well as their relatives will not be allowed to enter 
Switzerland until further notice. This restriction also applies 
to the members of the government in power since 1991 and to the 
members of the Haitian police and Armed Forces. In a joint 
communique released on Thursday, the Federal Department of 
Foreign Affairs and the Federal Department of Public Economy 
announced that a visa would be mandatory for the holders of 
diplomatic or special passports. 
  The Swiss trade embargo against Haiti now applies to all 
imports and exports between Switzerland and Haiti. However, 
medicines, food stuffs, and publications such as newspapers, 
periodicals, or books are excluded. Bern has been banning the 
sale or the export of weapons, oil, and oil products for one 
year already. 
  Swiss ships are no longer allowed to navigate in Haitian 
waters and the use of the Swiss or Haitian airspace by aircraft 
[not specified] is prohibited. This measure does not apply to 
international flights. The freeze on the funds and capital

applies to the assets of individuals who are under the direct or

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
intends during the German presidency of the European Union [EU] 
gradually to achieve majority decisionmaking in foreign and 
security policy. Speaking to the press in Bonn today, Kinkel 
also called for the "interlocking" of the EU with the Western 
European Union (WEU) defense alliance to be pushed forward. A 
common European foreign policy is particularly necessary in view 
of the events in former Yugoslavia, Kinkel said. 
  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) criticized the European Commission's white paper at the 
news conference, saying that "a series of interventionist 
principles" can be identified in it. Rexrodt argued by contrast 
for private initiative to be given priority over state activity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer by </F>
Susanne Krispin; place and date not given: "In Small Steps 
Toward the Five-Liter Car"] 
  [Text] [Krispin] What is your main goal in environment 
policy for Germany's presidency of the European Union [EU], 
which will begin in July? 
  [Toepfer] We understand the German EU presidency as a 
comprehensive task. At the same time, I have taken over, on 
behalf of the FRG, the chairmanship of the UN Committee for 
Lasting Development. In March 1995, we will hold a conference 
in Berlin of the states that have signed the convention on 
climate protection. And it is a matter of course that we are 
acting in the EU and in Germany toward the goal of achieving a 
lasting development. This includes the energy problem, because 
70 to 80 percent of the environmental problems are linked with 
energy consumption. Therefore, we will adopt this as a central 
goal of environmental policy. 
  [Krispin] Are there already specific concepts for the Berlin 
climate conference? 
  [Toepfer] We have a climate convention, which is binding 
under international law. In addition, the EU has committed 
itself to achieving a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions 
at the level of 1990 by the year 2000. In particular during 
Germany's EU presidency, we will have to work on that, because 
some states, such as Spain, will still increase their carbon 
dioxide emissions. Only if several states reduce their emissions 
will we be able to stabilize the values in Europe. Germany has 
to prove that we are able to clearly reduce the emission of 
carbon dioxide, which we have already been doing. 
  [Krispin] A total of 15 percent of the reduction is due to 
closing down industry in the east. In the west the absolute 
value is stable, which means a negligible reduction of the per 
capita value given the increase of the population in the old 
laender. However, Germany wants to save 30 percent. Where is 
the other 15 percent supposed to come from? 
  [Toepfer] We will reduce the use of brown coal for 
electricity production, because brown coal is the most difficult 
energy source regarding carbon dioxide. We will manage this 
with new coal-fired power plants with a high efficiency, such as 
in Jaenschwalde or at Schwarze Pumpe. This means a considerable 
challenge regarding jobs, which we confront by means of 
improvement measures in brown coal strip mining. In the west we 
must act in the field of energy supply to our households and in 
industry. For this purpose, we must correspondingly amend the 
decree on the use of heat. This means, above all, for the old 
laender that waste heat is to be used more efficiently, for 
instance via power-heat coupling. In the new laender, existing 
district heating plants are to be preserved, but are to be 
restructured for power-heat coupling. 
  [Krispin] Where can we save most? 
  [Toepfer] The greatest potential for reduction lies in the 
field of private households, followed by energy supply and 
industry. Smaller but still important potential can be found in 
small businesses and in the use of renewable energies. 
Regarding the increase in traffic, it is necessary to stabilize 
the carbon dioxide values. 
  [Krispin] How do you want to do that? 
  [Toepfer] During our EU presidency, we want to pass a 
decree, according to which the average consumption of newly 
registered cars must gradually approach five liters [consumption 
per 100 km] by the year 2005, because the cars that are 
registered nowadays will still drive for another 10 years. 
Their consumption is about 7 liters. The average consumption 
of the overall number of cars is considerably higher. In early 
1993 the EU should have presented such a decree. Unfortunately, 
it did not do that. Now we will urge a change. The other 
approach is a carbon dioxide energy tax. Over the past 
three-and-a-half years it has only been discussed in the EU, but 
has not been adopted because there is considerably resistance 
against it in the EU. We will try to make our legal and tax 
concept in the EU quite clear to bring about a decision. 
Furthermore, the FRG must make it clear that it has found a 
realistic approach to achieving its self-imposed goal of a 
30-percent reduction in carbon dioxide. 
  [Krispin] The German Institute of Economic Research (DIW) 
has now stated in a study that the FRG could introduce an energy 
tax on its own without suffering any economic disadvantages. 
  [Toepfer] I believe that the arguments in this study are 
very one-dimensional. 
  [Krispin] Why? 
  [Toepfer] Because the structural effects are not 
sufficiently taken into account. The DIW report is correct in 
stating that changes in the tax burden are also linked with 
dynamic technical developments, which are considered to be an 
advantage for Germany as a business location. However, we 
should do everything to get a general consent in the EU 
regarding the tax developments. 
  [Krispin] According to the study, energy-intensive 
industries, such as the chemical and steel industries, would pay 
higher taxes and the service sector would pay lower taxes. 
  [Toepfer] But the question is how we can achieve the goal of 
full employment simultaneously with foreign trade stability and 
environmentally compatible growth. I do not believe that we can 
suddenly change from a structure that is also characterized by 
industry to a structure that is solely oriented toward services. 
We agree with our French colleagues that in those places where 
we make exports we should take fewer national measures. In 
those places where we have regional markets, such as in many 
services, we can act on our own more easily. However, German 
chemical industry, for instance, must stand on its own in 
international competition. 
  [Krispin] What about the structural change? 
  [Toepfer] Of course, we must support structural change in 
the spirit of an ecological-social market economy. However, 
what should be the speed of implementation and how can 
ecological changes be made without entailing social imbalances? 
We are in a situation of upheaval and we have to implement the 
transformation of a planned economy into a market economy 
system. We are making progress with that. The economic growth 
rates in the new laender prove that.

<F P=106> [Article by "H.M.": "Tietmeyer Warns Against Excessive </F>
Haste"] 
  [Text] Gotha -- The current stage of preparations for 
European monetary union entail laying the appropriate economic 
foundations. The turmoil in the European Monetary System [EMS] 
over the past few years has made it perfectly clear that the EU 
[European Union] requires extensive economic and economic policy 
convergence to achieve stable monetary union. That is what 
Bundesbank President Tietmeyer stated at a business conference 
in Gotha staged by the Bavarian and Thuringian Governments in 
conjunction with the EU Commission. Karl-Heinz Wessel, chairman 
of the Bank Association, rejected criticism that the banks were 
being too cautious in eastern Germany. 
  Tietmeyer asserted that the strict fulfillment of the 
convergence criteria contained in the Maastricht Treaty must 
take priority over the time-frame that has been envisaged. 
Until the completion of monetary union, exchange rate movements 
must be possible, because monetary union can only be successful 
in the long term if there are reasonable exchange rates at the 
outset. There is too much of a danger that a monetary union 
that is commenced with excessive haste and overlooks actual 
facts will turn into a inflationary community that will 
ultimately collapse. 
  With regard to preparations for monetary union, Tietmeyer is 
of the opinion that at the present time the credibility of the 
monetary, economic, and fiscal policies of member states is 
being put to the test. European integration will only proceed 
if all the countries display the right degree of political will 
and create the necessary economic conditions. Only a lasting 
convergence geared toward stability within the EMS can, in 
conjunction with progress in political integration, create sound 
foundations for monetary union and, at the same time, act as a 
pointer for the future European central bank. 
  Conscious of their central importance for the economy and 
society, west German banks were very quick to set themselves the 
task of restructuring the east German economy. That was how 
Karl-Heinz Wessel, president of the Federal Association of 
German Banks, responded to the criticism that the banks were too 
cautious about issuing loans in the new laender. By the end of 
1995, over 6 billion German marks [DM] will have been invested 
in 1,100 east German businesses; 21,000 employees have found 
modern, well paid, and secure jobs in the new laender. The 
figures for the loans issued also speak for themselves. By the 
end of 1993, the total credit volume amounted to almost DM100 
billion. The west-east transfer of capital of DM37 billion 
contained in these figures does not even take into account the 
loans directly granted to east German companies by west German 
branches. According to Wessel, loans granted to companies 
amounted to DM57 billion at the end of 1993; in 90 percent of 
the cases, the loans were unsecured. 
  Another factor checking development is the low level of 
equity on the part of east German companies and the banks have 
also become active in this field. Parallel to developing their 
credit business, the banks have also extensively acquired stakes 
in firms. By the end of 1993, they held stakes in 189 
companies. In addition, the banks are under obligation to use 
their share of the "bank billions" to acquire stakes in 
medium-size companies. This undertaking will be realized by the 
end of the year.

<F P=106> [Article by "nh": "Gaddum: Germany Is Following the Path </F>
of Convergence"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 18 Jun -- Despite the current 
difficulties, Germany, together with other countries, is in the 
process of fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for convergence 
within the appropriate period. However, it is already clear 
that, in view of the two potential dates for entering the third 
stage of the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], the later date 
of 1999 seems more realistic, Bundesbank Vice President Johann 
Wilhelm Gaddum said at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in New 
York. The monetary side of the Maastricht Treaty is an 
absolutely solid basis for a lasting and stability-oriented 
monetary policy in a monetary union. If one takes into account 
that a European central bank can influence exchange rate policy 
far more than any central bank at the moment, some public 
expressions of dissatisfaction with the Maastricht Treaty are 
more difficult to understand. At the moment there is no reason 
to doubt that the antiinflation consensus of the member states 
will be consolidated. 
  Gaddum stressed that the economic advantages of monetary 
union are not exhausted with eliminating exchange rate risks and 
avoiding transaction costs. Of far greater importance is the 
promotion of economic cooperation, which emanates from the 
contents of the Maastricht Treaty and the anticipation of its 
introduction. In making an economic evaluation of the European 
integration project, one must not overlook that the only 
alternative, namely staying at the current status quo, would 
certainly not be without problems and tension. The 
globalization and professionalization of the money and capital 
markets will continue to pose considerable problems and demands 
for the central banks. A purely national orientation cannot 
necessarily be seen as a viable strategy for the future, Gaddum 
said.

  [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- The coalition crisis in 
Berlin has been resolved. Following separate meetings of the 
CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] parliamentary groups making up the coalition, 
governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen (CDU) told journalists today 
that the two sides agreed that in the interests of the capital 
they will continue their cooperation until the end of the 
legislative period in the fall of 1995. 
  The differences of opinion over Interior Senator Dieter 
Heckelmann (CDU) however have not been fully settled, it was 
stated. The SPD still objects to the senator's behavior in the 
affair concerning the contacts maintained by his spokesman, 
Hans-Christoph Bonfert, with right-wing groups. 
  According to Ditmar Staffelt, the SPD's regional and 
parliamentary leader, the SPD will not, however, submit a formal 
no-confidence motion in the [Berlin] House of Representatives. 
The majority of the SPD parliamentary group will abstain in the 
vote on motions of no-confidence brought against Heckelmann by 
the Alliance 90/Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party]. 
  The coalition compromise allows Heckelmann to remain in 
office. However the regional Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution is to be separated from the Interior Ministry and 
placed under the jurisdiction of the governing mayor. [passage

    [Editorial Report] Berlin N-TV in German at 1010 GMT on 22 
June carried a live relay of the 77-minute speech delivered by 
Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] to the SPD congress in Halle. 
  Scharping opened his speech by commenting on the huge 
expectations from the speech itself, regarded by some as the 
make-or-break speech for Scharping. He then stressed his 
support for the people of eastern Germany and strongly 
criticized the effects of 12 years of Kohl's rule on the people 
throughout Germany, particularly with regard to the welfare 
state. He said that following the defeat in the European 
elections the party has to fight more clearly and resolutely 
than before. He stressed that he is determined to win the 
election rather than come in second. 
  Scharping congratulated those who contributed to German 
unity, including the east European states. Referring to the 
achievement of the Social Democrats under Willy Brandt with 
regard to East-West relations, he stressed that Germany needs a 
new policy of the people and must take its international role 
seriously, bringing the people of Europe closer together. 
  Scharping then moved on to the subject of coalitions saying 
that his party intends to concentrate on its own policies and 
not on coalition speculation. He said that environmental, 
economic, and social policies must be considered in tandem and 
his party is not content to hand responsibility for one of these 
areas to, for example, the Greens. He then emphasized that he 
will seek to shake off his reputation for being characterless. 
  Moving onto the subject of taxes, he reiterated that high 
earners should not complain about high taxes and should never 
forget the poor. He said his party must go on the offensive and 
remove Helmut Kohl from government. Appealing to the east 
Germans never to forget what Kohl has done to them, he accused 
Kohl of deceiving people about the state of the economy and 
appealed to the people of the east not to vote for the Party of 
Democratic Socialism out of disillusionment. He added that his 
party wants an economic upswing, but not false optimism. 
  Stressing that his party wants tax exemption for those 
living 
on the poverty line, he said that the government has sacrificed 
people for the sake of competitiveness. Any upswing has to be 
accompanied by sound environmental policies and has to be in the 
interest of all. He added that the right wing will not be 
allowed to flourish under the SPD and condemned attacks on 
foreigners. 
  In conclusion, he stressed that the SPD wants a unified 
Germany that is strong economically, has good ecological 
policies, and lives up to its responsibilities to Europe and the 
world. 
  Scharping received a standing ovation at the end of his 
speech.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Heribert </F>
Prantl and Martin E. Sueskind; place and date not given: "Kohl? 
The Man Has No Idea of What the Future Is!"] 
  [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Scharping, are you a 
bad loser? 
  [Scharping] No, but I prefer to win. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Three months ago you said: "The 
greatest risk to our victory in the Bundestag election is that 
too many people assume the Social Democratic Party [SPD] will 
simply win the next election and lead the next Federal 
Government." This risk no longer exists. What now? 
  [Scharping] I also said that he who is too arrogant will 
have to watch out. After the fine victory in Lower Saxony we 
have sometimes reanimated bad old habits instead of 
concentrating on formulating a reformist policy. I am speaking 
of a policy that benefits the people in Germany and improves 
their living conditions. We have to implement the triad of 
reform in Germany -- fighting unemployment, social justice, and 
protection of the environment and nature. And we must link the 
necessity for reformist policy to the need for security. There 
is a good old statement that is even more true today than at 
many other times: He who wants to live in security tomorrow 
must fight for reform today. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Half a year ago the general feeling 
still prevailed -- even in the media -- that the time was ripe 
for a change of power. Yet now the winds have turned.... 
  [Scharping] Time remains ripe for a change in power. Yet, 
those who look at things only from the perspective of the 
election to the European Parliament do not see everything. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Have you not noted the change in 
mood, which one can feel so strongly? 
  [Scharping] I have, too, and it is true that a lot has 
changed as far as the mood is concerned. And the cartel for 
preserving the conservative power works and it also involves 
certain media. I never expected Helmut Kohl to relinquish power 
without a fight. This is exactly why I warned against assuming 
we would win automatically. He who wants to enforce his policy 
and gain the necessary power must be determined and concentrate 
his arguments on what is politically essential. We have not 
exactly managed to do that in the past three months. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] There is something the voters have 
against the SPD. Can you imagine what it is? 
  [Scharping] No, I think that the premise of your question is 
wrong. In the European election we did not manage to mobilize 
the voters. In the Bundestag election this will be completely 
different. I admit that some have become more skeptical about 
whether the SPD really wants the change and whether it can do 
it. However, starting with the party congress in Halle, this 
will be different. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is it a matter of time to emerge from 
the low or does the SPD, does its chairman, its chancellor 
candidate have to think of something very special? 
  [Scharping] People will not put up with the chancellor's 
complacency until 16 October. When I speak of the challenges of 
reformist policy, then I have to point out one thing: The 
Federal Government announces that, contrary to what it had 
promised so far, it will not provide a tax policy concept for 
the remaining years of this decade. As usual, it does not keep 
its promise and, as usual, it refuses to give answers. Just as 
in 1990 it is telling lies again on the tax issue, because it is 
planning to raise taxes after 16 October. Yet in the media this 
is not playing any role at the moment. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does this mean that the media are to 
blame for the current atmosphere and the bad image of the SPD? 
  [Scharping] No. Nevertheless -- and I say this ironically 
-- there are too many people in your trade who have found Kohl 
too hard a nut to crack. One example is all that talk about 
economic recovery. I wish it would come, as does any reasonable 
man. Yet, unfortunately, this does not change the fact that 2.3 
million households are on welfare in our country -- more than 
ever before, that we are short of 5 million jobs -- more than 
ever before, that public debts have reached 2,000 billion -- 
more than ever before -- and that a wave of bankruptcies is 
rolling across the country -- also unprecedented in the postwar 
era. The real situation is, thus, contradictory. It will only 
turn into a recovery for everybody when the slight recovery of 
the economy is made into something more with great 
determination. Politics must formulate hopes but it must not 
play around with those hopes for the purposes of party politics. 
Yet, this is exactly what the Federal Government is doing at the 
moment in an irresponsible way, as it did in 1990. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If things were the way you have 
said, then the question still remains whether you, whether the 
SPD has underestimated the chancellor. 
  [Scharping] I have not. Yet, when the SPD or some of its 
members argue about the speed limit, a dispute that was 
absolutely irrelevant, then the SPD's clear objective of a 
policy for ecological reform is thrust into the background. The 
establishment of an energy policy that is compatible with the 
environment, phasing out nuclear energy, the promotion of solar 
technology, preventive ecological work instead of repair -- 
these are the issues that are at the center of our policy. When 
the SPD says that it will put through equal child benefits and 
make sure that the living wage is not taxed -- and, at the same 
time, conducts artificial coalition debates, then these 
artificial things will always get more public attention than 
anything substantial. Or when the SPD says that it will cut 
ancillary wage costs, modernize state activities, and limit 
state debts -- and, at the same time, starts a public debate on 
certain rates -- then this is bound to irritate people. I want 
the SPD to focus on its own policies and the resulting dispute 
with the CDU. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Vague voices have spoiled the clear 
course, so to speak. Do you see no reason at all to be 
self-critical? 
  [Scharping] I have certainly also made mistakes, worked too 
much in certain areas, thus losing concentration. This will 
change. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Slogans from the sphere of security 
used by the SPD in the European election campaign were 
attributed by listeners in a radio survey to the Republikaner 
and the Christian Social Union [CSU] rather than to the SPD. 
Does this bother you? 
  [Scharping] I have noticed one thing: In 1972, the SPD 
conducted an election campaign for reform and enforcing its 
ostpolitik. One slogan at the time was: "Germans, you can be 
proud of your country." 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So you have not jumped on the 
bandwagon of nationalism? 
  [Scharping] On the contrary. In any public speech I 
campaign against nationalism and promote an open-minded society 
that is being held together by freedom and social 
responsibility. In connection with internal security I would, 
therefore, like to point out the following: Taking a tough 
position on organized crime is a struggle for freedom and the 
integrity of democratic institutions, which are indispensable 
for a law-governed state. Those who fail to understand that 
should look toward Italy. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The SPD helped the government 
coalition to surmount parliamentary hurdles on some substantial 
issues. Has this been worth the trouble for you? 
  [Scharping] The SPD has carried its point, which is 
something completely different to helping the government 
surmount some hurdles. This happened in the case of the pension 
reform and the health reform. On the issue of the nursing-care 
insurance, we achieved a compromise, which, from my point of 
view, was necessary for two reasons: First, to help the people 
affected; and, second, to eliminate the suspicion that the 
politicians have become absolutely unable to make any decision 
at all. As far as the asylum law is concerned, we made a joint 
decision. I wonder what the situation would be like in Germany 
today if things had not been changed. And the suspicion that we 
only shifted the problem to our neighbors, such as the Poles or 
Czechs, was and is wrong, as I could see first hand in both 
these countries. We did not remove any controversial points but 
carried our point, albeit sometimes by moderating our demands. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Somebody said that the SPD was 
"flirting" with the coalition government. 
  [Scharping] But then we would have to agree to the 
coalition's anticrime law in the Bundesrat, which we will not. 
The reason that we are not doing it is that this law is 
incomplete in substance and will remain ineffective. Nobody 
must think that DM80-100 billion in "sales" achieved by 
organized crime each year remains hidden somewhere in a sock or 
under some criminal's pillow. All of it is pumped into the 
economic system, building up a power that may ultimately be 
fateful for the economy and for politics. And if the accusation 
were right that we wanted to eliminate the controversial points 
with the coalition, then we would now have to assume a cowardly 
position and agree to everything the coalition wants. Yet, this 
is exactly what we do not want. This applies to many issues, 
particularly the Bonn government's blatant disrespect for the 
social matters of the citizens in eastern Germany. In light of 
the accusation that we are "flirting" with the government, how 
could anyone still understand the other accusation, namely that 
we are obstructing work in the Bundesrat? Both accusations are 
wrong. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Your policy vis-a-vis the government 
so far has often been described thus: Rudolf Scharping is a 
power tactician! 
  [Scharping] At the conclusion of the Wiesbaden party 
congress, I referred to major features of my personal conduct 
because I felt very clearly that some persons were deliberately 
spreading that suspicion, I mean the suspicion whereby I am not 
a man who acts according to an internal clock or compass. I 
consider that a denunciation. My participation in the first 
large peace demonstration in 1981 was linked to an attempt to 
throw me out of political office and thus intimidate me. I was 
not impressed by that. Instead, I was frightened that something 
like that could happen. But my attitude has not changed. A 
second example: When work was started on the construction of 
the Nuelheim-Kaerlich nuclear power station in 
Rhineland-Palatinate right at the beginning of the 1970's, the 
entire social democratic sector, not to mention the whole of 
German public opinion, was in favor of nuclear energy. Less than 
50 people spoke out against Muelheim-Kaerlich. I was one of 
them. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why should Helmut Kohl be voted out 
of office? 
  [Scharping] One can answer with a question and a sentence. 
The question is: Does anyone seriously think Germany will reach 
the year 1998 or even 2000 in a better condition with Helmut 
Kohl at the helm? Does anyone seriously think this man has any 
idea about the future? The man has no idea about the future. 
He thinks he can have another attempt. Is that enough? Never! 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You suspect him of downright egoism? 
  [Scharping] In any case, the kind of egoism that is 
established in society. Social responsibility and a feeling of 
compassion have shrunk under Helmut Kohl's administration. 
Elitism is assessed purely on the basis of one's wallet. 
Anyone who confuses elitism with a high income must include 
Messrs Schneider or Zwick among the elite. I do not do that. 
And anyone who thinks that productivity rises in line with 
income ignores the real producers in this society. Apart from 
the responsible, innovative, and creative enterprises, these 
producers include those who, working in factories, hospitals, 
the police, and other places, see to it that society remains a 
society. We are facing a decisive question: Do we want to 
constitute a society, in which case, to put it in casual terms, 
we must keep the business running by means of a common 
conception of the dignity of the individual, his social rights, 
and mutual social responsibility? Or should society, according 
to Schaeuble's way of thinking, be kept together by means of 
national pathos and nationalist slogans? 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You have answered the question why, 
and very energetically. The question how is probably even more 
important. What conditions and what kind of party alliance 
should Chancellor Kohl abandon on 16 October? 
  [Scharping] I have never seen a coalition on any ballot 
paper for a Bundestag election. I have only seen parties. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In that case do you consider a 
black-green alliance possible after the Bundestag elections? 
  [Scharping] I hear rumors about such a possibility in 
Saxony, but I cannot imagine it on a federal level. The SPD as 
a whole must take greater care that the debate is held with all 
parties, primarily with the CDU/CSU, about the federal 
government's policies. But one must not forget that, for example 
in eastern Germany, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] 
represents a danger to the possibility of pushing through a 
reform policy in Germany. One also cannot forget that the 
Greens are affecting people's acceptance of reform policy with 
their partially irresponsible suggestions, for example the 
avalanche of levies they suggest or the clear nonsense they have 
uttered concerning foreign policy. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Then who is to blame for the fact 
that 
the PDS has become so strong and has risen to become the third 
strongest force in the East? 
  [Scharping] The Federal Republic's policies are to blame. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE] Are the Greens on the way to becoming a party 
of the people? 
  [Scharping] No. They evidently want to take the FDP's place. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has the political battle with the 
Republikaner already been won? 
  [Scharping] No. It is a good thing that we were able to 
prevent the Republikaner from entering the European Parliament 
at the elections. It is enough that there are neofascists in 
the Italian Government. But one should make no mistake. The 
rightist radical and nationalist part of the Republikaner has 
not been beaten yet. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You said recently: We need the 
entire party to be much stronger than over the past three 
months. Be more precise! Has a section of the party left you 
in the lurch? What section was it, which persons? 
  [Scharping] The SPD has developed a greater team spirit than 
one year ago. Lately this team spirit has fluctuated somewhat, 
but after the Halle congress it will be different again, and 
then everything will move forward. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But is it wrong to ask whether 
Gerhard Schroeder has been helpful for the chancellor 
candidate's election campaign? 
  [Scharping] He will be helpful. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Last weekend, he accused you of 
having a wrong election campaign concept, and he even said you 
would have to get "clearly" more than 40 percent of the votes on 
16 October. Is that helpful? 
  [Scharping] Schroeder did not put it this way. But I see we 
also have problems with public impressions. It remains a clear 
goal -- a policy of reform, which is specifically aimed at 
improving conditions for the people, will only be possible if 
the SPD is at the front. So we want to become the strongest 
party, and there is a considerable potential for reaching this 
goal. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is it true that the SPD is in a deep 
communication crisis? 
  [Scharping] Not within the party itself. But outside the 
party, there are certain barriers. The journalistic cartel in 
the surroundings of Helmut Kohl works relatively well. It is 
unconstitutional for the Federal Press Office to use public 
funds for covertly launching derogatory comments on the SPD 
chancellor candidate. Moreover, the fact that some of the 
information on the government's work is withheld -- a case in 
point is the Federal Government's tax policy concept -- means 
that precisely the same method is being employed as in 1990, in 
other words, the method to withhold the truth and act according 
to the motto: Vote for Kohl first, and collect the money later. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In this election campaign, you will 
probably not repeat the mistake of marching at the top alone. 
What will be your team in the Bundestag election campaign? We 
would like to hear names. 
  [Scharping] You will have to wait. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] How long? 
  [Scharping] Until 31 August at the latest, but presumably 
not as long as that. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] But will there be a team? 
  [Scharping] First, there will be a suggestion of how a new 
federal government could work in an efficient and modern way. 
This means that the number of ministries will be reduced, and 
the number of state secretaries will be drastically reduced. We 
will thereby demonstrate how public administration can be made 
leaner and more efficient, so that the state does not have to 
impose new taxes or surcharges on the citizens whenever a new 
project is to be implemented. Second, clarity will be created 
on who will be in charge of which ministry in such a federal 
government. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] If it is not or cannot be you, by 
whom would you want to be governed? 
  [Scharping] Are you honestly expecting an answer to this 
question? 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] By what type of federal chancellor 
would the citizen Rudolf Scharping want to be governed? 
  [Scharping] By a federal chancellor who combines economic 
competence and social responsibility, has a clear idea of the 
future, and knows that Germany can only live in peace with its 
neighbors, if tolerance and living in peace with one's neighbor 
are appreciated to a larger extent again. By a federal 
chancellor who never forgets that people who work their way up 
have an obligation toward those who have not been able to do so. 
And by a chancellor who never forgets that the strong countries 
on the earth must assume an existential obligation for the 
weaker ones and for their development. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Why does the public know so little 
about Rudolf Scharping as a private person? This is at least 
our impression. 
  [Scharping] Because preserving the private sphere requires 
us not to agree to every deprivatization, and because 
demonstrating publicly what is on one's mind ultimately leads to 
equating policy with lifestyle. The substance of policy is not 
determined by the way you dress or spend your vacation. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When did you really feel at ease in 
the last 12 months since you were elected party chairman? 
  [Scharping] Repeatedly. I have had many wonderful 
experiences in this time. One of them, which is to do with 
politics, was the great initiative of pupils under the motto 
"Pupils Help Others Live" for the benefit of refugee children in 
the former Yugoslavia. There are also wonderful private 
experiences. I have seen children who are self-confident and 
show regard for others. Such self-confidence includes respect 
for self-confidence, which means rejection of the 
commercialization of children. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are you a religious man? 
  [Scharping] I am a Christian. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What does this mean to you as a 
politician? Is being a Christian a private matter, or is it 
more? 
  [Scharping] I think it is more. If you have a certain inner 
attitude, it will also influence the way you act in public. 
Those who out of private conviction or faith speak about 
charity should act accordingly in political life. Let me 
illustrate this by an example. I said some time ago that it 
would not be bad if the salaries of the members of the Federal 
Government were frozen for some time. I earned gloating remarks 
because the Rhineland-Palatinate Government is bound by the 
Civil Service Remuneration Act, just as every civil servant is, 
including those who work only on a temporary basis. I found it 
extremely unpleasant to publicly demonstrate my private 
attitude. Since I have been a member of parliament -- in this 
particular case, of the Rhineland-Palatinate Landtag -- I have 
always told myself that now I am in a relatively good position, 
should think about my own career, and help those who have to 
finance university studies, bridge unemployment, or must 
overcome some other difficulty. I have done so since 1975, 
without publicly talking about it. I made available my salary 
increases as minister-president for charitable purposes. 
However, it embarrasses me to publicly demonstrate my private 
behavior, in order to be able at all to act credibly as a 
politician. I consider it much more important that the 
political parties that call themselves Christian have largely 
given up the social contract, which is based on charity and 
solidarity. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Does a politician who is a Christian 
have to advocate retaining the church tax? 
  [Scharping] He does not have to, but he may. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Should the church-state relationship 
in our country be maintained in the current form and 
characteristics? 
  [Scharping] Not in every respect, but basically, it should. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] One of the bases is church tax. 
  [Scharping] I would not consider this a basis, but a 
characteristic -- however, one that makes sense. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Are there any personages, possibly 
examples, that have coined or impressed you, from whom you are 
trying to learn? 
  [Scharping] The first figures in whom I was politically 
interested were John F. Kennedy, Willy Brandt, and Martin Luther 
King. I have gradually come to orient myself at 
characteristics, not individual persons alone. However, I still 
hold the view that -- to mention two social democrats -- the 
vision and steadfastness of Willy Brandt and the clarity and 
efficiency of Helmut Schmidt are exemplary characteristics. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Has there ever been a point in your 
political life at which you considered giving up this job? 
  [Scharping] Yes. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What was that? 
  [Scharping] Being aware of the high risk of being defeated 
in the 1987 landtag elections and the possible consequences, I 
had made arrangements to promptly resign from politics, if 
necessary. Independence is important to me. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Can we draw conclusions from this for 
the Bundestag elections on 16 October? 
  [Scharping] No, we will win the Bundestag elections. Nor 
would anyone take over a task such as that of party chairman for 
fun, even less so if there were the prospect of having to give 
it up after two years. In this respect, you need a firm, inner 
conviction and the ability to go through difficult times and 
conflicts. 
  [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] One does not take it over for fun. 
Is it fun, nevertheless? 
  [Scharping] On the whole, it is. I like this task, and I am 
doing it with great inner commitment. Otherwise, I would be 
unable to hold such an office.

<F P=106> [Article by "Jl": "Federal Government's Debts Soaring to </F>
Astronomical Heights"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 21 Jun -- By 1997 the Federal 
Government's debts will rise by at least another 220 billion 
German marks [DM], probably to approximately DM907 billion. 
This can be seen in the 1993 annual report by the Federal Debt 
Administration. The supreme federal authority for financial 
administration bases its information on the 1994 budget law as 
well as on the medium-term financial planning. Even though by 
1997 new debts are supposed to be halved, compared with 1993, to 
DM38 billion, annual repayments will at least triple to DM215 
billion because of the preceding high loans. The burden of 
interests will rise by DM22 billion to about DM69 billion. 
Measured by the overall budget expenditures, this means an 
increase in the interest burden from 10 to almost 14 percent. 
  The long-term overview of the Federal Debt Administration 
shows that, over the past few years in particular, the 
liabilities of the Federal Government have been soaring to 
astronomical heights. During the 20 years from 1950 to 1970 
they rose from DM6.1 billion to DM45.5 billion. During the 
following 10 years federal debts quintupled to DM230 billion. 
During the next 10 years (until 1990) liabilities rose clearly 
more moderately, but, with DM542 billion, they exceeded the 
limit of DM0.5 trillion for the first time. By the end of 1993 
this amount rose to DM685 billion. At the same time, the year 
1993 was the climax (so far) of annual gross borrowing with 
DM149 billion. The same goes for net borrowing (gross borrowing 
minus repayment): With DM78.5 billion, the Federal Government's 
new debts were about three times higher than in 1980. 
  At the end of 1993 the Federal Debt Administration 
administered financial debts by the Federal Government and its 
special funds amounting to a total of DM943 billion. The 
overall debts of the public budgets (including railroads and 
post, plus laender and communities) is estimated at almost DM1.6 
trillion. This would correspond to a 50-percent share in the 
overall (nominal) GNP in 1993. In 1980, for instance, this debt 
quota was 32 percent in western Germany, in 1970 only 19 
percent. In 1970 the debt burden had a share in the GNP of not 
more than 17 percent. Thus, the debt quota has practically 
tripled within the past 30 years or so. In international 
comparison, too, Germany has deteriorated considerably. 
  According to the Federal Debt Administration, the financial 
debts of the Federal Government's special funds reached DM309 
billion last Year, which is almost twice as much as in 1990 and 
11 times as much as in 1970. The largest chunks go to the 
Bundespost, the federal railroads, and the "German Unity" Fund. 
In addition, there are the liabilities of the European Recovery 
Program special fund, the Hard Coal Equalization Fund, the 
so-called Loan Repayment Fund, and the financial debts of the 
East German Railroads. The Federal Government holds about half 
of the overall debts of the public budgets, which amount to 
almost DM1.6 trillion; the special funds hold one-tenth, the 
laender (west and east) one-quarter, the communities, railroads, 
and post one-tenth. The Federal Debt Administration points out 
that, because of the railroad reform, in 1994 it has to take 
over the so far not administered railroad debts, which is 1,200 
loans against notes of the federal railroads amounting to about 
DM26 billion. 
  The Federal Government financed almost two-fifths of the 
gross borrowing of DM149 billion last year by issuing loans. 
About one-third were federal bonds, 12 percent federal treasury 
notes, and 9 percent each federal treasury letters and financial 
assets. Depending on their terms, about two-fifths each go to 
loans over nine years and to liabilities between two and five 
years. Approximately 10 percent of the loans each have terms of 
five to nine years or up to two years. Almost half of the 
portfolio of DM685 billion goes to loans, about one-fourth to 
federal bonds, and about 10 percent to federal treasury notes.

  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops were flown to 
the borders of Rwanda and Zaire overnight at the start of a 
UN-mandated mercy mission to protect thousands of minority 
Tutsis, military officials said Thursday [23 June]. 
  France said that 8,000 Tutsis were surrounded by 
Hutu-dominated government troops in southwestern Rwanda. 
  The officials said none of the French soldiers had yet 
crossed into Rwanda, where up to 500,000 people, mostly ethnic 
Tutsis have been killed in an ethnic carnage unleashed by the 
death of the president of Rwanda, a Hutu, in an unexplained 
plane crash on April 6.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council will certainly vote 
tonight on the French proposal for military intervention in 
Rwanda. Without waiting for the resolution to be adopted, the 
French army has already started to deploy men in eastern Zaire. 
Our special correspondent in Goma is Jean Helene: 
  [Helene] Some 50 French soldiers who arrived by Transall 
[aircraft] this morning, probably from Bangui, are waiting at 
the edge of the tarmac, next to the Goma airport terminal. Some 
of them are surveying the runway, which is 3,200 meters long: 
ideal for large transport planes. 
  The detachment arrived with only two jeeps. No heavy 
materiel is to be seen around, but large transport planes are 
expected in the next few hours. According to reports heard in 
the town, French planes are also said to have landed troops in 
Bukavu, 200 km further south. The runway of that airport, half 
the length of the one in Goma, can only take fully laden Hercule 
C-130s, though Transalls with 11 [metric] tonnes of freight can 
land. 
  In town the market is as busy as usual. There is just a hint 
of excitement among the security forces. Opposition supporters 
are frowning, explaining that the French operation will benefit 
President Mobutu. The people of Goma are worried that a 
French-UN intervention, virulently criticized by the rebels of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front, may bring troubles to the town. 
Some are even afraid the Rwandan conflict may spill over to 
this side of the border. 
  Jean Helene, Goma, RFI 
  [Announcer] Various rumors, denied by the French Government, 
spoke of some French troops already being present on Rwandan 
soil, sent as scouts to prepare a possible intervention. 
  The intervention will not be easy, and is already creating 
serious problems to the UN peacekeepers in Kigali. [passage 
omitted] 
  Major Plante, the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 
spokesman in Kigali, explains. He is interviewed by Assane Diop: 
  [Begin recording] [Plante] The commander of the force 
decided 
to rotate personnel, a measure to take these people, about 40 in 
all, and take them to Nairobi. We are going to collect about 40 
of our military observers who are currently in Nairobi and bring 
them here to replace them. This will be done today. 
  [Diop] You say there were various signs that made you think 
these African soldiers were not welcome in rebel territory? 
  [Plante] Perhaps so, or perhaps it was a decision made here 
that it was better from a security point of view, that those 
people should go and work at the Nairobi (?mission) for the 
moment, and come back later. 
  [Diop] But isn't it connected to the fact that these 
countries -- Senegal, Congo and others -- are supporting the 
French intervention plan, an intervention to which the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] is opposed? 
  [Plante] Don't make me say things I don't want to, and that 
I 
can't say. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Major Plante, the UNAMIR spokesman in 
Kigali. 
  In Brazzaville, the Foreign Ministry announced yesterday 
evening that Congo will not after all send troops with the 
French force in Rwanda. But Congo does agree to take part in 
Unamir, the UN force, and to send men, but in the very clear 
framework of the deployment in Rwanda of the extra 5,500 
peacekeepers. 
  But in Senegal yesterday the cabinet confirmed its 
willingness to send troops to Rwanda in the framework of the 
humanitarian operation initiated by France, which is raising 
quite a lot of questions among the Senegalese public. Nicolas 
Balique [reports]: 
  [Begin Balique recording] Forty-eight hours after the 
agreement in principle announced during the French foreign 
minister's visit to Dakar, President Abdou Diouf has in fact 
confirmed the firm yes from his country to the humanitarian 
intervention in Rwanda. The communique published after the 
cabinet meeting speaks -- I quote -- of a contribution to 
stopping the massacres, and reestablishing peace and accord. 
  If nothing has been agreed about the number of men 
committed, 
and the precise modalities of their participation, the 
authorities are recalling that their agreement remains linked to 
the decision of the UN Security Council. Nor has there been any 
comment on the departure from Kigali of the 40 or so Sengelese, 
Togolese, and Congolese observers. 
  At a time when the massacres in Rwanda continue, the press 
is 
asking questions. Yesterday the daily LE TEMOIN carried as a 
front page headline over five columns: "What sauce are our 
djambars [soldiers] to be served up with?", speaking about 
Senegal's hasty -- I quote -- yes to France. The daily WAL 
FADJRI thinks that this support seems to be precipitate. 
  Nicolas Balique, Dakar, RFI. [end recording] [passage 
omitted] 
  [Announcer] France does not despair of convincing the RPF of 
the validity of the operation. The Foreign Ministry 
spokesperson reported that there have been contacts in Paris 
with representatives of the RPF starting this morning. Muriel 
Pomponne: 
  [Begin Pomponne recording] Yes, Jacques Bihozagara, the 
representative of the RPF in Europe, was in Paris this morning 
at the invitation of the French authorities. He had a long talk 
with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, and an hour and a half of 
more technical discussions with representatives of the 
Cooperation, Foreign, and Defense ministries and at the office 
of the president of the republic. The conclusion of the RPF 
representative: Our position remains unchanged. We reject the 
idea of French intervention in Rwanda, whatever its timeframe 
and whatever its size. 
  The proposal not to intervene in zones controlled by the 
RPF but to maintain permanent contact with the RPF headquarters 
did not succeed in softening the position of the rebel movement. 
However, the RPF is not opposed to France putting its financial 
and material means at the disposal of UN forces who could 
intervene in the framework of UNAMIR-2, though of course French 
soldiers should not take part in the force. 
  Alain Juppe is reported to have told Jacques Bihozagara that 
he noted his position. 
  Paris therefore now has two other mediators in contact with 
the RPF in Uganda: they are Ambassador Jean-Michel Marlaud 
[French ambassador to Rwanda] and the deputy director of African 
affairs. So French pressure continues, but the RPF appears to 
be inflexible for the present. [passage omitted] 
  The former French minister for humanitarian action, Bernard 
Kouchner, has just returned from Rwanda. He considers French 
intervention is, in his words, a terrible solution but a 
necessary one.

  [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- Planned French military 
intervention in Rwanda would last for at most two months, French 
government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said Wednesday [22 June] 
after President Francois Mitterrand held talks with top 
ministers. 
  The UN Security Council was preparing meanwhile to vote on a 
controversial French proposal to deploy up to 2,000 troops and 
lead an operation to protect civilians from the ethnic bloodbath 
in the central African country. 
  Sarkozy said the operation would have "a maximum duration of 
two months" and would entail "comings and goings from the place 
where our soldiers will be posted." 
  A small contingent of French elite troops has gone to Goma 
in 
Zaire close to Rwanda's northeastern border on an evaluation 
mission and military sources said that Bangui, capital of the 
Central African Republic, would be the "operational base." 
  Sarkozy said the views expressed in Wednesday's meeting 
formed a "broad general consensus and consisted in explaining 
the essentially humanitarian reasons for intervention in Rwanda." 
  Mitterrand met with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, Defense Minister Francois Leotard and 
Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin, the chief of general staff 
Admiral Jacques Lanxade and the president's personal military 
aide, General Jean Quesnot. 
  Sarkozy denied speculation that there has been disagreement 
among top French leaders on the planned intervention, which has 
brought warnings that it would be considered an invasion by 
Rwanda's mainly Tutsi rebels and only lukewarm support from the 
international community. 
  "I deny that totally," he said. "An operation of this kind 
can only be carried out amid total understanding." 
  In another development, a foreign ministry spokesman said 
representatives of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) on 
Wednesday had "contacts" here with the French government, which 
they accuse of backing the Hutu majority regime in Rwanda and 
being indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of 
thousands of Tutsis. 
  "Contacts are continuing in Paris with RPF representatives," 
the spokesman Richard Duque said, but he gave no details. 
  On Tuesday, a top RPF official, Jacques Bihozagara, called 
off a planned visit from Brussels to Paris, saying that he 
wanted to meet a "competent political decision-maker with regard 
to military intervention." 
  Sarkozy said the government believed the RPF "cannot 
reproach 
us for saving members of a community they themselves belong to, 
or they will have to explain that to the international 
community." 
  Balladur plans to address the French national assembly on 
Rwanda later Wednesday during the regular session of questions 
to the government.

  [Excerpts] While waiting for the decision by the UN 
Security Council that is to be made this evening, France is 
still determined to intervene in Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  The subject was naturally raised this afternoon at the 
Assembly during a session of questions to the government on 
current issues. The prime minister insisted on coming in person 
to explain France's position. Edouard Balladur said: 
  [Begin Balladur recording] This is an operation where force 
can be used, but with a solely humanitarian aim. This force--I 
repeat clearly--is not a buffer force, but a force to protect 
civilians. We will act together with the forces joining with us 
in such a way that we can contribute from the borders to the 
security of the people under threat and can enable them to 
receive help from aid organizations. 
  Under no circumstances will our forces intervene deep inside 
Rwandan territory, and the operation will be of limited 
duration. It will end at the end of July. Humanitarian 
intervention by France in Rwanda is a difficult operation. No 
one is pretending otherwise--the government least of all. 
  This decision is a serious one. Everything will be done to 
ensure that French soldiers will not be put in situations where 
they do not have the means to ensure their own safety. [end 
recording] 
  So France has really and truly decided to intervene in 
Rwanda. Defense Minister Francois Leotard even announced this 
evening-- without waiting for the decision of the UN Security 
Council--that the operation is to start tomorrow. And, Luc 
Lemonnier, preparations have been continuing throughout the day: 
  [Correspondent Lemonnier] Yes, Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard confirmed a few moments ago that the operation would 
start tomorrow, implying by the same token that the vote of the 
UN Security Council was a foregone conclusion. This is 
certainly not jumping the gun, since it is true that it is hard 
to see how-- despite the reticence of the OAU--the Council could 
refuse to support Paris' humanitarian commitment, and even less 
that one of the five permanent members would use its veto. 
  So we already know that Operation Turquoise--that is its 
code 
name--will mobilize 2,500 men: 1,000 from France and 1,500 from 
contingents already stationed in Gabon and Djibouti. It is 
known that experts have been studying routes between Zaire and 
Rwanda for more than 24 hours, especially landing possibilities. 
  Two Russian cargo planes arrived in Bangui today, in the 
Central African Republic, with French military equipment, and 
sand-colored military vehicles were seen on the runway of the 
airport, as well as a refueling plane. 
  Finally, the French defense ministere was keen this 
afternoon 
to deny reports claiming that French troops entrusted with 
preparing the mission had already arrived in Rwanda. For the 
moment, everything is happening on the borders while the UN 
Security Council vote is awaited.

  [Text] Speaking to the Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Commission on Thursday [23 June], Alain Juppe rejected the idea 
that France is alone in its intervention in Rwanda. The foreign 
minister said that the United States, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and 
Portugal could give logistical support. "Senegalese troops will 
be at our side, and discussions are underway with Guinea 
Bissau," he said.

  [Excerpts] After the UN Security Council squeezed through 
its authorization of the French military and humanitarian 
mission in Rwanda, troops are continuing to arrive, in 
particular in Goma in Zaire. [passage omitted] The man appointed 
prime minister just after the Arusha agreements last year, 
Faustin Twagiramungu, who was very wary about the principle of 
intervention a few days ago, appears more willing to accept it 
today, as he told Assane Diop: 
  [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] The French program must be 
(?undertaken). I did not meet with only the UN ambassador 
Jean-Bernard Merimee; I also met the secretary-general of the 
United Nations and other ambassadors. They all told me that it 
was a matter of stopping the Rwandan tragedy, and that, 
therefore, no one should oppose it. If the content of the 
resolution is simply to stop the tragedy and not to drag us into 
another conflict where France would come up against the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] on the ground, I think the resolution 
should be accepted. 
  As far as I am concerned, I think I have a duty to make 
contact with the RPF; to discuss and see what is positive in 
this resolution; to agree, of course, that we should continue to 
work to stop the massacres and put an end to the tragedy; and 
also to ask France to stick to the content of the resolution 
adopted by the United Nations. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Balladur was asked at the National Assembly in Paris who was 
supporting France in this matter, and this is what he answered: 
  [Begin recording] [Balladur] In Africa, Senegal, with whom 
we 
have long been comrades in arms, will supply one unit. 
Discussions are underway with other countries. The political 
support of a large number of African states -- French speaking, 
Portuguese speaking, and English speaking -- which has been 
expressed to us directly, is encouraging. In Europe the 
operation has the support of the Western European Union and 
several member countries of that organization have told us they 
are available to give logistic support: I can name Portugal, 
Spain, Italy, and Belgium. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard and </F>
Jacques Bihozagara, Rwandan Patriotic Front official in charge 
of international relations, by correspondent Patrick Poivre 
d'Arvor; Leotard is in the studio; Bihozagara's location not 
given--live] 
  [Text] [Poivre d'Arvor] Defense Minister Francois Leotard 
is here with us in the studio. France is trying to appear 
reassuring, but the OAU has said it is not in favor of French 
intervention in Rwanda. The same applies to a number of foreign 
countries, as well as to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. We 
have the impression that France is very much alone in this 
initiative. 
  [Leotard] I do not think we can say that. You see, we waited 
for the Security Council resolution, which was just adopted a 
few minutes ago. We, of course, began preparations earlier, but 
we would not have intervened--and this must be quite clear--if 
there had not been a resolution from the United Nations. We are 
not organizing a national, a French, action. We are there to 
apply a resolution--which has just been approved by the United 
Nations and which we had wanted--allowing us to put an end to a 
number of massacres and atrocities. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Having been given this green light, will 
the 
operation get under way tomorrow morning at dawn? 
  [Leotard] The operation will begin on the morning of 23 
June. 
It will begin--in order to demonstrate what our intentions 
really are--near a small zone that is just across the border on 
the other side of Bukavu, at a place called Cyangugu, where 
several thousand Tutsis are currently threatened. This is to 
show quite clearly that we will save whoever we meet, whatever 
ethnic group they might belong to, whatever nationality they 
are, if they are foreigners. 
  We will continue from this point, having at our disposal the 
most thorough possible information, looking at those places 
where there are children, civilians, possibly religious 
communities--as we learn things little by little--places where 
people are victims of these massacres. This is France's 
intention. A limited action, a humanitarian action. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] The idea being not to go as far as the 
capital, Kigali? 
  [Leotard] We want to act on Rwandan territory as little as 
possible, and we do not want to take part in the current 
conflict in any way. I say this quite clearly to those who are 
currently tearing themselves apart. It is not our intention, 
our aim, to take sides. What we want to do, in the name of the 
United Nations, is to save human lives. So we will see where we 
can do this, in the light of the information we will have as 
early as tomorrow morning, and in what way we can do it--for 
example, by going to a certain place to collect children whose 
lives are threatened. These pictures are so horrific for the 
international community that France feels this is not acceptable. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] So are there geographic and also time 
limits 
to the intervention? 
  [Leotard] There is a time limit. The prime minister this 
afternoon at the National Assembly--after we had discussed the 
issue with the president--very clearly spoke about the end of 
July. We asked the United Nations to accelerate the process of 
the intervention of UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda]--the force the United Nations will deploy on the 
ground--to ensure that it could immediately take over from the 
French operation. If we had just waited for the United Nations, 
we might, alas--as you know-- have waited for several months 
more. That would have meant thousands more deaths. We are, 
therefore, preceding the UN force, in a way, which will wear 
blue helmets and which I hope will intervene during the summer. 
In the meantime, still under the mandate of the Security 
Council resolution, we will intervene in the coming weeks to try 
to save a maximum number of these poor people from the situation 
in which they find themselves. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You spoke a moment ago about the president 
and the prime minister. Were there not two lines in this 
affair: one which was a hard line from the president and the 
foreign minister, and a more cautious line from the prime 
minister and yourself? 
  [Leotard] We deliberated very carefully on this issue, but I 
always expressed my concern that it be restricted to a very 
limited time frame and to make sure that French forces did not 
end up being considered international policemen who might 
intervene all over the world. This is neither my aim nor the 
concept I have of the use of the French Army. 
  Under this circumstance, however, we have the specific 
demand 
of the United Nations, of Mr. Butrus-Ghali. We have the means 
to do it, since we have troops in the region. We turned to the 
Europeans and the Africans, for it is quite normal that the 
Africans should, first and foremost, take this crisis in hand. 
We have also obtained the agreement of the Senegalese and the 
Guineans, who will intervene with us, and then of a few 
Europeans--too few, alas. I think that you will see, however, 
with the first child that is saved--for this is the issue--then 
you will see international support appearing. Our aim is to save 
children. I do not know who can disagree with this aim. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You know that this is a high-risk 
operation. 
  [Leotard] Of course, but there is no military operation 
without risks. French soldiers are sufficiently trained, 
sufficiently responsible, equipped, determined, enthusiastic for 
this kind of mission, because they know that they are serving a 
humanitarian cause. There are not many better things than to 
save people whose lives are threatened. 
  I think we must stress that the instructions they have been 
given are that they should not come into contact with the RPF's 
forces, that they should not come into contact with the people 
who are currently tearing each other apart. You will see that 
they will carry out this mission with a great deal of 
responsibility and mastery of the force they have at their 
disposal. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You are talking about the RPF. We have 
Jacques Bihozagara with us live, who is in charge of 
international relations for the RPF. 
  Having just heard Francois Leotard, having heard Alain 
Juppe--with whom you met just now--are you still convinced of 
the validity of this operation? 
  [Bihozagara] We think that the operation to rescue people in 
danger had been organized and planned at the level of the 
Security Council. To that end, the Security Council had adopted 
a resolution, Resolution 918, which broadened the UNAMIR 
mandate. We cannot see why France should rush in now. So we 
still oppose this, for the reasons we have always given--namely, 
that France was in Rwanda in 1990 allegedly to protect foreign 
and French citizens, but afterwards we saw that France began to 
support the existing government, and it took three years for 
France to leave Rwanda. Now France is returning to Rwanda for, 
it is said, a humanitarian action. Well, we think there are 
reasons other than humanitarian ones. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] You think that the real reason is for Paris 
to try to maintain the current regime at any price? 
  [Bihozagara] Why not? Because France has never shown us 
anything different. So the regime that is carrying out 
massacres today has been aided, supported, and armed by France. 
Now we believe that the current French action is precisely to 
continue its aid to the regime that is retreating in disarray. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Francois Leotard, you have facing you the 
representative of a ethnic group that you want to save, and he 
is not in agreement. 
  [Leotard] There is no such intention. I would like to say 
this, with all due respect to Mr. Bihozagara. He met Mr. Juppe 
this morning. I think the talks were frank--we explained what 
our aims were. I repeat: The instructions that have been given 
to the French forces is for them never to come into contact with 
the RPF, which Mr. Bihozagara represents. In other words, they 
are not to try at any time to become involved in this conflict. 
  I do not see how we can be reproached for saving people 
who--if I have understood things properly--are Tutsis, in the 
first place, the people in Cyangugu whom we want to protect. I 
really do not see how anyone can doubt our good faith in this 
matter because there are no other intentions. I am telling Mr. 
Bihozagara this very forcefully and with a great deal of 
conviction. Experience will prove it. I hope he will wait for 
the next few days. We will remain in contact with the RPF. In 
fact, we intend to remain in contact in order to inform them 
daily, regularly, hour by hour, of our intentions, of our 
positions--to show clearly that never, at no time, do we have 
any belligerent intentions in this matter. Never. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Mr. Bihozagara, you are Tutsi, in the 
minority there. Do you, nevertheless, think that all possible 
forms of help must be given to avoid the genocide that is now 
going on? First, can you confirm the preliminary figures that 
have been given. The German foreign ministers has spoken of 
500,000 dead. Are we on that scale of values, if I can put it 
like that? Second, what can be done to stop this genocide, if 
there is no foreign intervention? 
  [Bihozagara] You know, let me repeat that it is wrong to say 
that France is going to help the Tutsis or save the Tutsis. 
This is because in this conflict, in this genocide, it is not 
only the Tutsis who are the target, but everyone who does not 
speak the same language as the regime that France supported for 
reasons that, I repeat, we cannot understand. 
  So now France wants to return to Rwanda, allegedly to save 
the Tutsis. You know very well, however, that Rwanda has, in 
fact, lost more than 500,000 people. Out of the 500,000 people, 
I would say that 95 percent are, of course, of Tutsi origin. 
Two-thirds of the Tutsi population inside the country has been 
wiped out, while the Hutu intellectual elite of the moderate 
opposition has been 80 percent wiped out. Now, I think that if 
France were to return there that first, it is too late, and 
second, we think that the French intervention is more likely to 
complicate the situation and to set the whole region on fire. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Mr. Leotard, would you like to comment, 
since we were talking just now about the Africans? Marshal 
Mobutu was not a favorite in western capitals. Here he is 
giving you a helping hand with his airports. 
  [Leotard] We asked Zaire to allow the planes to land at 
Zairean airports, so that was a normal contact between one 
government and another in order to use our landing platforms. 
This is completely normal, if you will remember, I repeat, that 
our aim--and I recall the strong feelings you quite rightly 
aroused on your network--our aim is to save human lives. 
  I do not see how it can be that a week ago all the 
nongovernmental organizations and you, quite rightly--and a lot 
of international observers--told us: What are you waiting for? 
You must go in. Now that we have embarked on the process, 
people are saying: Why are you going in? 
  I repeat: It is not we who are going in. It is not the 
French Government. It is the United Nations, which is asking 
the French Government to undertake this humanitarian action 
while waiting for a larger force--of more than 5,000 men, in 
fact--to come in UN uniforms to protect the people. 
  We were not obliged to do it, that is quite true, but we are 
doing it. I can assure you that it is a difficult and 
burdensome operation that, indeed, is not without risk. We are 
doing it, I think, because we have a specific concept of our 
international responsibilities, of France's role with its 
African friends, because France does have a role to play, of 
course, with our African friends. These friends include 
Rwandans of whatever ethnic group. 
  There you are. It is as simple as that. I am sorry that 
people are forgetting today, from what I hear, that there was a 
resolution by the UN Security Council a few moments ago. 
  [Poivre d'Arvor] Right. So I will add that France is 
calling on its European and African partners to participate in 
this intervention in Rwanda, an intervention we will follow hour 
by hour and which--as the defense minister has just 
confirmed--should begin tomorrow morning on the frontier of 
Zaire and Rwanda. 
  Thank you, Mr. Leotard. Thank you, Mr. Bihozagara.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zaire, Rwanda's neighbor, will 
serve as a base for the French troops for Operation Turquoise. 
The Zairean ambassador to France, Baya Ramazani, explained to 
Luc Lemonnier why he entirely approves of France's intervention: 
  [Begin recording] [Ramazani] This is not an intervention 
against one ethnic group or another, but to end genocide. It is 
easy to moan and wonder who is criminal and who is not, but the 
problem we are facing clearly is to put an end to genocide. 
  [Lemonnier] Do you think France is suited to lead this 
intervention? 
  [Ramazani] I don't think there is one country better than 
another to end this genocide. It is up to the international 
community to do something. We cannot observe passively what is 
going on. Zaire has agreed, within the framework of this 
intervention, to put operational bases at the disposal of the UN 
forces. I don't think it will be an easy operation, but it is 
necessary. Should we continue to denounce the genocide and do 
nothing? [end recording]

  [Text] France will fund half of the budget (in other words 
250,000 francs out of 500,000 francs) for a "humanitarian radio 
for Rwanda," which will be set up shortly by Reporters Without 
Borders, the journalists' rights defense organization, Lucette 
Michaux-Chevry, the minister-delegate for humanitarian action, 
announced yesterday. 
  "This radio will provide a useful counterbalance to the 
`Mille Collines [one thousand hills] Radio,' whose devastating 
influence is well-known," the minister said in a communique, 
referring to the radio controlled by the Hutu extremists and its 
calls for violence. According to Mrs. Michaux-Chevry, this 
radio, "serving nongovernmental organizations," could provide a 
valuable service, for instance by broadcasting information about 
displaced persons, those who have disappeared or are being 
sought, advice on travel, security, access to medicines, 
drinking water, and so forth.

  [Text] Paris, June 22 (AFP) -- French rail workers 
protesting job cuts went on strike on Wednesday [22 June], 
seriously disrupting train services across most of the country. 
  High-speed trains serving the south and west of the country 
were hit, with one train in three running between Paris, Lyon 
and Marseille, and one train in two working Atlantic routes. 
  But the high-speed service linking Paris with Lille in the 
north was not affected. 
  Regular mainline services were also severely hit in the 
western, south-western and south-eastern regions, but operated 
normally in the north and east. Suburban Paris services were cut 
by a third or a half. 
  Railway workers are protesting plans by the state-owned SNCF 
rail company to cut 5,900 jobs in 1994, after doing away with 
6,000 jobs in the previous year. The strikers, who began their 
action Tuesday night, go back to work on Thursday morning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi by Mario </F>
Pendinelli; place and date not given: "Jews Our Elder Brothers"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pendinelli] From the day you 
decided to enter politics you have gone from triumph to triumph. 
So are there no regrets? 
  [Berlusconi] I have had, and still have, some regrets. The 
greatest was caused to me by the mistrust shown by some Jews 
toward my government. For me relations with Israel are of more 
than diplomatic importance. As you know, I am a Catholic and, 
many people may not know, I am still capable of being moved. I 
still hold in my heart the words that Pope John Paul II 
addressed the Jews during his visit to Rabbi of Rome Professor 
Elio Toaff: He called them "our elder brothers." The memory of 
the Holocaust weighs on the conscience of the whole of Europe. 
  We must banish forever all forms of anti-Semitism and 
racism. 
We must explain to children that Israel is not only a crucial 
stronghold of peace in the Middle East, but also a symbol of 
struggle against and resistance to fanaticism and barbarism. My 
government regards Israel's security and development as 
essential. This is an issue that must be taken up by all the 
Western democracies, especially those of Europe, since Israel is 
ideologically part of Europe. 
  [Pendinelli] With regard to Europe, some people say that 
your 
foreign minister, Antonio Martino, is a member of the 
"Euroskeptics" club. 
  [Berlusconi] That is nonsense. Antonio's father was one of 
the men who helped to build Europe. Euroskepticism resulted 
from the errors of the old class of European leaders. People 
have attached to the idea of Europe a merely economic, sometimes 
even unrealistic, significance. We need to proceed once more 
from the principle of ideological and political unity, without 
reducing it to an exaggerated and elitist dream. Nor must 
people dream of building an isolationist Europe, hostile or 
indifferent to its vital relations with the U.S.. In this 
regard [German] Chancellor Kohl's success in the European 
elections will certainly yield fruit. His government in Germany, 
like ours in Italy, represents a factor of stability and the 
basis for imparting a new boost to Europe. 
  [Pendinelli] You maintain good relations with Kohl, but your 
relations with the present leaders of our own Popular Party seem 
very bad. You have been accused of trying to conduct a takeover 
campaign within its ranks, and also of having promoted, through 
your television networks, a culture of egoism, consumerism, and 
personal success. Is this too a source of regret for you? 
  [Berlusconi] Some of them do presume a monopoly on 
solidarity 
and every other Christian value. Others still talk about 
capitalism as a sin requiring atonement and fail to realize that 
the market economy is not an ideology but the most effective 
means of organizing production. It is up to us to ensure that 
this means producing widespread wealth, lower unemployment, and 
efficient services. In order to do this it is necessary to cut 
wastage, to eliminate the patronage system, and to make people 
feel responsible for themselves. 
  Anyone who really identifies with Christian humanism cannot 
fail to know that his first duty is to combat the most flagrant 
injustice of our time -- unemployment. And this struggle is 
linked to another -- that of defending the family as the vital 
unit of society and of the development of democracy. I want to 
state clearly that I share the pope's anxieties: There is no 
real democracy without a defense of the family. This is Forza 
Italia's stance. 
  As you can see, this is as far as can be imagined from the 
unprincipled consumerism that we in fact oppose. And if some 
members of the Popular Party have not yet realized this, their 
voters do. 
  But we are not plannning any takeovers. What we want, 
rather, is a calm dialogue. And we are waiting to see how the 
Popular Party meets the challenge of its congress. 
  [Pendinelli] Let us move on to another possible cause for 
regret -- the constant sarcasm of [League Secretary] Bossi, who 
still accuses you of recycling the "old." 
  [Berlusconi] If by the "old" Bossi means the old system of 
party domination, associationism, state control, he is entirely 
mistaken. We are the force that is making the crucial 
contribution to demolishing all this. And the League ministers 
are making an intelligent and loyal contribution to this task. 
If, however, by the "old" Bossi means the roots of the great 
culture of liberal democracy and Christian humanism with which 
we identify, he is making a serious mistake, because those roots 
are neither old nor new, but eternal. 
  [Pendinelli] Do you think that the controversy over the 
fascist threat in Italy is over now? 
  [Berlusconi] I hope so. But there is something that I would 
like to add to that. I think that what has died is so-called 
antifascist unity, a term that in political jargon was intended 
to ennoble associationism. Antifascism is not dead, however, 
because it is one aspect of the struggle against every form of 
totalitarianism, so it cannot and must not die. 
  [Pendinelli] We have not discussed the most talked-about and 
delicate issue: you and television. 
  [Berlusconi] Actually I no longer concern myself with 
Fininvest. And soon I hope to succeed in separating, formally 
too, my political future from the future of the business that I 
created. I have embarked on a new career, a difficult but 
exciting task. I believe that I have offered the Italian people 
the chance to extricate themselves from a future without freedom 
or prosperity which seemed predetermined. They have rewarded me 
with their trust. I am sure that I will show that I deserve it.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlo Maria Santoro: "Farewell to Little Italy"] </F>
  [Text] The country has neglected its international affairs. 
It can now play the role of a medium-sized power focusing mainly 
on Europe. The author of this article is a professor of 
international relations at the University of Milan's Department 
of Political Science. 
  Foreign policy is back in the news after a long hiatus. 
Immersed as we have been in the collective psychodrama of the 
change of political system, the elections, and the new 
government, the external world seems to have disappeared. When a 
political system collapses and a new coalition is formed, with 
new political forces, it is natural for attention to be focused 
on domestic policy. 
  This is so true that the sole controversy to arise during 
the 
brief period of the forming of the Berlusconi government 
concerned the designation of the minister of interior rather 
than that of the foreign minister. On the other hand, the 
tendency to neglect its foreign policy and concentrate on its 
domestic policy is part of the Italian tradition dating back to 
the postwar era. During that period, however, there was the 
bipolar international system, which marginalized the role of the 
weaker players and in any case guaranteed Italy's security. But 
today, things are radically different, and for at least two 
fundamental reasons. First, because Italy has a government made 
up of a new political elite that has yet to demonstrate its 
ability to project itself to the outside world. And second, 
because the others are watching us, and frequently voice 
criticism. 
  Regarding the first point, there is nothing to say or do but 
await the testing of the new government, then evaluate its 
performance. On the second point, however, there is much to be 
said. It seems to us, in fact, that the reactions of some of our 
allies and friends, in Europe and even across the Atlantic, have 
been at the same time lively, somewhat conformist, but above 
all, exceedingly of alarm. 
  The prime minister did well in Rome, as did the foreign 
minister in Brussels and Washington, to reassure them and 
emphasize the continuity of and the government's adherence to 
Italy's alliances. Even so, it is evident that the new 
government will have to change some things in foreign policy as 
well. Not so much in substance, which seems to be the fear of 
some abroad, as in style, which does not mean a nation's 
external manners, but rather the synthesis of its political 
behavior, or more precisely the image presented to the outside 
world by a nation. 
  The style of Italy's foreign policy during the postwar 
period 
was essentially characterized by a low-profile approach; that 
is, an approach lacking initiative or imagination. In substance, 
its style expressed a way of being on the scene that was 
conformist and flatly aligned with the decisions of its major 
allies. This approach, rooted in ideology, translated 
frequently into imitative decisions, and sometimes into flights 
from reality. 
  Europe, for example, as an institutional plan of 
unification, 
is and remains, together with NATO, one of the two cornerstones 
of Italian foreign policy. No thinking person today could make a 
case for being against this concept of Europe, just as, for 
years now, no political party except Communist Renewal has been 
opposed to NATO. Indeed, the polls indicate that Italians are 
the most Europe-minded of all. Why, then, should anyone be 
worried? To succeed in changing for the better, it is probably 
necessary to revisit some key concepts that have been buried in 
oblivion by the dominant ideologies. The first of these should 
be that of national interest, an indispensable prerequisite for 
any European policy. Then there is the international role of a 
country that has always confused its role with rank; that is, 
settled for second best. And lastly, there is need to reflect on 
the concept of Italy as a medium-sized power; that is, as a 
national player operating in a geopolitical and regional 
economic context in which, by the force of things, it will be 
compelled to take a position. By habit, dating back to a distant 
past, Italian foreign policy has been characterized 
alternatively by either the frustrated and fanciful ambitions of 
a great power, or the fears and excessive bashfulness of a small 
power. To update its foreign policy, therefore, Italy needs to 
recognize the fact that it is a medium-sized power, that it is a 
player operating within a grid of international alliances made 
up of autonomous actors, just as France, Great Britain, or Spain 
are. 
  In other words, Italian foreign policy must recognize the 
fact that, with the United States in the process of 
disengagement, Germany aiming at a political rebirth, and a 
Europe partly in trouble, Italy cannot once again decline to be 
present in those areas in which none of its allies are 
interested. It is therefore neither a question of contesting 
alliances or revising boundaries, nor one of continuing the old 
way of choosing ideologies, whereby political adversaries are by 
definition mortal enemies to be demonized. 
  If these premises are taken as a basis, the principal lines 
of Italy's future foreign policy can already be outlined. If its 
style is made more incisive, and if the compass indicating the 
direction of Italy's foreign policy points, as it always should 
have, toward our national interest and recognition of our role 
as a medium-sized power operating in a predetermined context of 
alliances, it will no longer be necessary to respond to the 
captious questions of our allies, and to the less elegant 
caveats of our neighbors to our east and south.

<F P=106> [Interview with Francesco Speroni, minister for </F>
institutional reform, by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not 
given: "Speroni: Reforms -- Yes, But With the Opposition" -- 
first paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] "Reforming the regional electoral systems is the 
first step toward federalism." Francesco Speroni, minister for 
institutional reform, is off, and he has no intention of 
stopping. The start was a very fast one, with the majority 
expressing immediate agreement on his bill. 
  [Caviglia] It must have been hard to persuade your 
government 
allies. 
  [Speroni] Not at all. As far as federalism is concerned, the 
National Alliance is still putting up a fight, but I see no 
insuperable difficulties. 
  All that was needed the other day was an hour's discussion, 
more by way of clarification than anything else. The only 
annoying thing was that I had to get up at six in the morning to 
get to the meeting. 
  [Caviglia] Can the double ticket of federalism and 
presidentialism bring everyone into agreement? 
  [Speroni] It would be fine with me; I have always been a 
presidentialist. But let us get something straight: The direct 
election of the presidents of the regions does not mean 
presidentialism. It is the same system used to elect mayors. 
  [Caviglia] Now that you have taken the first step, will you 
tell us which ones you intend to take next? 
  [Speroni] The next step is definitely the appointment of the 
panel of experts whose job it will be to revise the 
Constitution. What we have just agreed on is nothing more than a 
partial bill on the regions, a portion of the constitutional 
reform that is being brought forward so that the 1995 elections 
can be held under the new system. The rest will come with the 
reform of the Constitution along federal lines. 
  [Caviglia] Who will be the members of this panel? In recent 
weeks there has been talk of the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] constitutionalist Augusto Barbera, as a gesture of 
goodwill toward the opposition parties. 
  [Speroni] Unfortunately, Barbera cannot be on it because he 
is tied up all summer with a lecture tour in England, but he is 
willing to help. I still want to widen the debate to include 
the opposition parties. Federalism is a heritage shared by all 
who believe in it, not a matter of majority and opposition. 
  [Caviglia] And what about Miglio [of the Northern League]? 
  [Speroni] Miglio will not be involved, but only because he 
has declined the offer, twice since the government was formed. 
I can hardly go down on my knees and beg him. 
  [Caviglia] How long do you think it will take to complete 
the 
federal reform? 
  [Speroni] Well, it is definitely not a matter that can be 
settled in three months. The only one who managed that was de 
Gaulle, but he did it by going over parliament's head, and I 
have no intention at all of doing that. The new Constitution 
must not be the constitution according to Speroni or Berlusconi; 
it must be what all the Italians want.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Guidi Swims Against the Tide"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Europe is preparing to close immigration 
gates even further, but the Italian family and social affairs 
minister [Antonio Guidi] is speaking of broadening the criteria 
used to consider immigrants. While, in Luxembourg, the Twelve's 
ministers were deciding to tighten the screws, Minister Antonio 
Guidi was in fact in Casal di Principe (Caserta province) 
attending a meeting organized by the CNEL [National Council for 
Economy and Labor] on non-Community immigration into the south. 
Here, in one of the areas with the highest proportion of 
immigrants, the minister announced his intention to deal with 
legal and illegal immigrants into Italy. 
  For Guidi the problem is a general one, namely, how to 
safeguard the rights of immigrants "whether regular or 
irregular." Irregular immigrants, the minister remarked, also 
"generate wealth, because they work and produce an income: They 
must therefore have the same rights and the same duties. 
Immigrants from outside the Community must be safeguarded as 
people and, as such, considered centers of rights and duties." 
  Guidi recalled that "organized crime is the connective 
tissue 
for the exploitation of immigrants from outside the Community." 
This situation had to be considered more closely and seen as 
part of "the broader problem area of safeguarding immigrants' 
rights." According to the minister, priority measures must 
include providing health care for all immigrants, although he 
warned against demagogy: "I want to implement a gradual policy, 
but one which will mark a turn for the better. This is a 
serious problem, and we cannot perform miracles." 
  In Caserta province, up to 20,000 foreign workers throng to 
take part in the fruit and tomato harvest every summer. Guidi 
stated that his own presence in the area indicated the 
government's "concern and commitment." Initially, the minister 
will propose setting up a "working group" with regional and 
local government representatives "in order to verify how the 
funds earmarked for aid and counseling centers were used 
throughout the country." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Riccardo Franco Levi: "The First Test"] </F>
  [Text] The stock market has sounded the alarm with a 
4-percent drop in a single day, but the government, via the 
treasury minister, has responded only in part. In an official 
statement released during the evening, Minister Lamberto Dini 
for the first time undertook to launch "a corrective maneuver 
that will impinge on the current year's deficit and, to an even 
greater extent, on trends for 1995," and announced that the hole 
which the recent Constitutional Court verdict had dug in the 
INPS [National Institute for Social Insurance] accounts would be 
addressed separately and covered "with specific revenue-raising 
measures." However, he did so only after referring to the 
"boosting measures undertaken by the government" and without 
quoting any specific figures at all for the salvage operations, 
although by now there is little doubt that this year's 
"supplemental budget" will have to bring in about 5,000 billion 
lire, whereas the real operation, scheduled for 1995, will have 
to achieve about 40-45,000 billion lire (INPS excluded). 
  Crowned with their double election victory, Silvio 
Berlusconi 
and his ministers had taken the wheel on a boat that was sailing 
with the wind and carrying a cargo that, though heavy, gave the 
impression that it was well distributed and made fast in the 
hold. Indeed, the recovery, which was export-led, was running on 
an even keel, while the public debt represented less of a 
threat, thanks mainly to the lower inflation rate, which had 
reduced interest costs. 
  Then the boat suddenly began to list, it encountered head 
winds, and the cargo began to shift. The lire, state bonds, and 
the stock market endured repeated buffeting, and interest rates 
raised their ugly head again, adding to the public debt. In 
spite of all this, the boat suffered hardly any damage and 
continued on much the same course. True, there was the terrible 
INPS accident, but, apart from the fact that it had been 
inherited from the past, taken on their own, the 30,000 billion 
lire involved hardly justified the sudden squall. 
  Indeed, there was more to it than that: There was 
uncertainty as to the new crew's navigational skills and, to an 
even greater extent, its intentions. Basically, it was a matter 
of confidence and credibility, and as the sore point was the 
balance of payments, the officer who has had the weightiest 
responsibilities thrust upon him has been the treasury minister. 
  And Lamberto Dini has begun to do his bit, albeit with 
something approaching timidity. It is true that it will be up 
to the government collectively to set the pace of recovery. 
Nevertheless, in view of the commitment that the "revenue 
minister," in other words the finance minister, has already made 
to keep the burden of taxation at its current level, it will be 
up to him, the "spending," to take on the most difficult job, 
that of curbing spending and ensuring that targets are met. He 
should, therefore, have put out a strong, specific message 
regarding the public debt, even if it means forcing his hand, so 
as to enable the Community to release the third portion of the 
European loan immediately, to reassure the markets, and to 
trigger a beneficial cycle of recovery, investment, and growth. 
  Although the financial markets are not given to patient 
waiting, the Treasury Ministry still has time. Lamberto Dini 
enjoys the requisite personal prestige. What is more, no one is 
better than he is at creating a climate of confidence and 
calming fears of a further rise in inflation, and nothing can 
help him more than a Bank of Italy rendered fully credible by 
its independence. The Bank's director general is due to be 
appointed in a few days. The wisest decision that Dini can make 
will be to allow Governor Fazio complete freedom of choice.

<F P=106> [By Bruno Bartholoni] </F>
  [Text] Vatican City, June 21 (AFP) -- The Vatican on 
Tuesday [21 June] urged world governments and arms manufacturers 
to rein in the escalating trade in deadly weaponry, saying 
traditional arguments in favour of arms sales were morally 
unjustifiable. 
  In a 36-page document on conventional weaponry, experts from 
the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace chaired by Cardinal 
Roger Etchegaray firmly rejected the argument that "if one state 
refuses to provide arms another will." 
  Such a stance was "without any moral foundation." 
  The Vatican recognised the right of states to legitimate 
defence, but "the fact that a state can legitimately possess 
arms and hence implicitly transfer or receive them brings with 
it serious obligations." 
  "Arms can never in any way be treated like other goods 
exchanged on world or internal market," the council said in the 
report entitled "The international arms trade, an ethical 
reflection," calling on governments to resist economic pressures 
to increase arms sales. 
  Acknowledging the economic disruption that could be caused 
by 
job losses in the arms sector, such difficulties "cannot 
legitimate the maintenance of an arms industry simply because of 
the risks involved in readjustment or in order to preserve jobs." 
  It insisted that governments had a duty to ensure the 
retraining of workers affected by military conversion. 
  The document denounced illegal arms sales which notably led 
to the re-arming of Iraq, condemning the use of false documents 
and the violation of arms embargoes. 
  "This same severe judgement also applies to companies that 
transfer components or dual-use products when they are well 
aware of the probability of their being used for hostile 
purposes." 
  The council warned that selling arms to all-comers could 
expose countries to war on their own territories, and said that 
the "arbitrary" sale of weapons to poor countries posed the most 
serious threat to peace. 
  ``In some developing countries, military expenditures are 
higher than those for health and education combined. 
  ``This is particularly tragic in those countries where 
people 
are unable to meet their basic needs because war is destroying 
their very means of subsistence,'' the report said. 
  Without waiting for completion of a code of conduct being 
worked on by the five permanent nations of the UN Security 
Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States 
-- the council recommended that competent bodies negotiate 
limits or a ban on certain categories of weaponry. 
  It suggested that landmines, "which cause unacceptable 
damage 
to civilian populations long after the cessation of 
hostilities," and other "excessively injurious" weapons could be 
subject to such restrictions. 
  It also called for international norms and sanctions to 
curtail the activities of arms traders who were "always ready to 
offer their services."

<F P=106> [Pekka Kostamo report: "Austrian `Yes' Strengthens the </F>
Front"] 
  [Text] Austria's massive yes to the EU [European Union] 
strengthens the pro-EU position in all three other candidate 
countries. This delighted comment came from Foreign Trade 
Minister Pertti Salolainen (Conservative Party) on Monday [11 
June] as he learned about the outcome of the Austrian referendum. 
  Salolainen was convinced that the Austrian result will have 
a 
positive impact at least on the undecided members of the Finnish 
parliament and on other citizens. The Austrians have, in fact, 
fought the same kind of battle as the Finns over billions in 
subsidies. 
  A negative result in Austria would have been, according to 
Salolainen, a "dreadful shock." 
  "The referendum result has once again made a mockery of the 
opinion polls," Salolainen added joyfully. The referendum in 
Austria also accelerates the forthcoming disintegration of the 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association] and EEA [European 
Economic Area] base. Austria's decision to join the EU breaks 
up the base of mutual arrangements between the EFTA countries.

  [Text] According to Admiral Jan Klenberg, commander in 
chief of the defense forces, the implementation of disarmament 
agreements between the superpowers is causing a military 
build-up in northern Europe. Russia is transferring more troops 
to areas near Finland because of the Conventional Forces in 
Europe Treaty, and the implementation of Start II is making the 
Northern Fleet the most important nuclear weapons center for 
Russia. 
  Klenberg was explaining the military development of the 
Calotte area in Rovaniemi today. Klenberg said that there are 
no changes in the military situation in northern Europe despite 
the upheavals in Central Europe. 
  Klenberg also reiterated the defense forces' negative stance 
toward new road and railway connections to areas that are 
important from the military point of view. However, the 
Ministry of Communications is continuing to plan the Salla 
[northeastern Finland] railway line. Experts evaluating the 
profitability of the Salla railway line have recommended that 
one-third of the financing come from share capital and long-term 
transport agreements. The rest would be financed with loans 
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The 
Ministry of Communications is to have talks on the project with 
the Russians at a ministerial meeting planned for the autumn.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Iceland Hits Out at Norway in </F>
Fisheries Conflict"] 
  [Text] Reykjavik -- The Icelandic Government decided at a 
cabinet meeting yesterday "to condemn in the strongest terms" 
the Norwegian coast guard's methods used against Icelandic 
fishing vessels inside the so-called protection zone around 
Svalbard. 
  A press statement from the Prime Minister's Office says, 
among other things, that instead of taking the Icelandic boats 
into port and bringing Icelandic seamen before Norwegian courts 
-- or taking the Svalbard conflict before an international court 
-- the Norwegian coast guard is resorting to the same methods 
which have so far only been used by Greenpeace. 
  This was a reference to the international environmental 
organization's at times militant methods at sea. 
  At the cabinet meeting the government also decided to ask 
foreign experts in international law to evaluate Iceland's and 
Norway's legal positions in the so-called protection zone off 
Svalbard. 
  On the basis of their investigation the Icelandic Government 
will reach a decision on a possible complaint to the 
International Court in The Hague. 
  The decision for a legal investigation, the statement goes 
on 
to say, was made because so far the Norwegian Government has 
refused all negotiations about Iceland being granted fishing 
rights off Svalbard. 
  The Icelandic Government also promises to assist those 
fishing boat companies which want to bring actions against the 
Norwegian authorities for the loss of fishing equipment off 
Svalbard because Norwegian coast guard vessels have cut trawl 
cables. 
  The Icelandic Foreign Ministry will, for example, help the 
national association of fishing boat companies, LIU [expansion 
unknown], to employ a lawyer to prepare the cases.

<F P=106> [Report by Yngve Hellestol and Aslak Bonde: "FAFO: EU </F>
Choice Not So Dramatic"] 
  [Text] According to FAFO [Trade Union Center for Research, 
Investigation, and Documentation], the effects of a yes or a no 
to EU [European Union] membership are less dramatic than many 
people would like to suggest. 
  The "No to the EU" organization is considering preparing a 
counterreport before the LO [Trade Union Confederation] 
congress. But first it will take a good look at the FAFO report. 
  "The EU's importance for the trade union movement is 
exaggerated. The gloomy pictures that are painted both if we 
remain outside and if we join the EU are incorrect. There is 
much confusion in the debate. Many people engage in the 
discussion as if the EEA [European Economic Area] does not 
exist," FAFO research chief Jon Erik Dolvik said. 
  Yesterday, alongside researchers Arild H. Steen and Dag 
Stokland, he made public the FAFO report on the consequences of 
EU membership which the LO secretariat had commissioned. This 
EU report will form the foundation for the LO's discussion of 
the EU question in the run-up to the extraordinary LO congress 
on 22 September. Yesterday LO leader Yngve Hagensen remained 
unwilling to signal what is his view of EU membership. The LO 
leader contented himself by saying that the LO congress in 
September will reach a clear decision for or against. 
  As far as the trade union movement's working conditions and 
trade union rights are concerned, the report concludes that 
these will not be undermined in the event of EU membership. 
  "There are no formal reasons preventing the continuation of 
the Nordic model of working life, and Norway will be included in 
the same set of rules in both the EEA and the EU," the FAFO 
report states. 
  For the Norwegian economy the effects of EU membership are 
more uncertain, in FAFO's view. There is uncertainty about 
whether the economic growth resulting from EU membership will be 
so high as to meet the increase in spending resulting from 
membership. FAFO estimates net spending in the state budget at 
6.5 billion, something that would necessitate an increase in 
growth in GNP of 0.15 percent per year over a 10-year period. 
  For industry FAFO takes the view that competition for 
private 
industry and service companies will largely be the same in the 
EEA and the EU. The exception is the food industry. In FAFO's 
view, EU membership will give rise to tougher conditions and 
reduced employment for agriculture-based industry and 
agriculture, while fisheries-based industry on the other hand 
could experience more exports. 
  Per Ostvold and Kjell Iversen, respectively leader and 
secretary of "No to the EU," said that Jon Erik Dolvik is 
extremely biassed in his presentation of the FAFO report. 
  "He used most of his time to engage in polemics against the 
arguments of the no-organizations. I did not hear him arguing 
against a single yes-argument. In addition, he also said a 
number of things that were downright wrong -- among other things 
he rejected the suggestion that the EU's white book and the 
guidelines from the meeting of the EU's finance ministers will 
lead to bigger differences in wages," Ostvold said. 
  Both Ostvold and Iversen stressed that they acquired copies 
of the report at the press conference. They could therefore 
only speak about the presentation. 
  "But if the report is as it was presented we cannot rule out 
the possibility that `No to the EU' will produce a counterreport 
before the LO congress," Iversen said. 
  The central no-sayers in the LO did not comment on the FAFO 
report yesterday. The spontaneous reactions of "No to the EU," 
however, indicate that the report will not be accepted as a 
neutral base for debate by the most active no-sayers in the 
trade union movement. 
  The self-confessed yes-sayers who were present at the press 
conference yesterday were unable to understand the no-side's 
reaction. In the presentation it emerged, for example, that EU 
economic union is not suited to the Norwegian economy. The FAFO 
people in no way supported the government's claim that EU 
membership will give economic growth -- even if they did not say 
the opposite. It was also pointed out that fewer people will be 
employed in agriculture and the food industry as a result of EU 
membership. 
  These are points that the yes-side does not usually make.

<F P=106> [Report by Kaa Eneberg: "Opposition Greater Than Expected"] </F>
  [Text] The Social Democratic movement will recommend its 
voters to vote yes to the EU [European Union] in the referendum 
on 13 November. This was the expected result when the Social 
Democratic "Europe congress" yesterday voted by a two-thirds 
majority on the position the party will adopt. 
  The whole congress, a continuation of the spring's 
unfinished 
32d party congress in Goteborg, was a two-day arrangement that 
was lacking in drama. 
  Both sides were energetically addressed as good party 
comrades and the "winning duo," [party leader] Ingvar Carlsson 
and [party secretary] Mona Sahlin, were careful to declare that 
the congress had not created either winners or losers. 
  Even in the toughest battles -- between no-sympathizer Soren 
Wibe and yes-supporters Goran Farm and "finance minister" Goran 
Persson over economic policy, for example -- warm smiles were 
exchanged when there were handovers on the speaker's rostrum, 
Mona Sahlin noted with satisfaction. She called for continued 
"sensitive" and objective EU debate in the election campaign, 
which should however, be directed chiefly toward toppling the 
Bildt government. 
  Ingvar Carlsson pointed out that the EU "is neither a Social 
Democratic nor a nonsocialist project." 
  "We want Social Democrats to view membership as an 
opportunity," Ingvar Carlsson declared. He and several 
yes-sympathizers in the debate described how Social Democratic 
ideas will win a sympathetic hearing and greater currency in the 
EU as a result of Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria joining. 
  This was contradicted by the no-side. For example, Sten 
Johansson declared that the Social Democratic side in the EU 
will increase by a mere 0.5 percent in the event of enlargement. 
No one questioned this claim. However, afterward Mona Sahlin 
said that she predicts that the nonsocialist domination in the 
EU will decrease. 
  "This fall we are hoping to win the election here at home 
and 
several countries are waiting for elections which could go in 
the same direction," she said. 
  In the vote 103 delegates voted against the yes-line, while 
the party leadership won the support of 232 votes for the 
yes-line. Last week the party executive backed the yes-line by 
33 votes to zero -- something that caused some surprise among 
grass roots. According to the opinion polls, including one in 
Sunday's DAGENS NYHETER, around half of Social Democratic 
sympathizers are undecided about or are opposed to the EU. 
  At a press conference Ingvar Carlsson said that he does not 
believe in opinion polls. He mentioned the landslide victory 
for the yes-side in Austria as an example of how they can be 
proved wrong. 
  "If I were to believe them I should take a vacation up to 
the 
election on 18 September," he said at the press conference 
alluding to all the polls recently which have pointed to a 
majority of their own for the Social Democrats in the fall 
election. 
  The congress decision was welcomed as a clear message to be 
pushed in the election campaign. Without naming names Ingvar 
Carlsson attacked opposition politicians who had been hoping 
that the Social Democrats would be deeply divided on the EU 
issue. 
  Ingvar Carlsson believes on the contrary that the congress 
decision has shown a fairly united and strong party that is 
giving its backing to Social Democratic ideas. 
  The criticism that the congress delegates were not elected 
simply for their positions on the EU issue was described as a 
strength. The delegates were chosen for the regular party 
congress and have a responsibility therefore for the whole of 
the party's program and not simply the view taken of the EU. 
  Prime Minister Carl Bildt welcomed the Social Democratic EU 
decision. 
  "I warmly welcome the Social Democratic party congress's 
decision to say a clear and unambiguous yes to the agreement 
that has been negotiated and to Swedish membership of the 
European Union," the prime minister said in a statement 
immediately after the Social Democratic congress decision, 
according to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBYRA.

  [Text] Today, Sunday, the delegates to the Social 
Democrats' extraordinary congress are expected to say an 
unambiguous yes to EU [European Union] membership. 
  But among Social Democratic voters interest in the Union 
remains cool -- only 23 percent are in favor, while all of 51 
percent are against. This is shown by DAGENS NYHETER/Temo's 
June opinion poll on the EU. 
  The result is not significantly different from the previous 
poll. In the whole of the population the no-side clearly has 
the upper hand with 43 percent against the 31 percent of those 
who support EU membership. 
  For the time being at least the bodies of public opinion on 
the EU seem to have stabilized at these levels. 
  The Temo figures square well with the recent poll by the 
Central Bureau of Statistics. 
  The Temo poll was carried out between 8 and 15 June, and 
1,012 people were asked by telephone what decision they would 
reach in a referendum today on EU entry. 
  The number of those who are undecided is still large -- 26 
percent. 
  A majority, 52 percent, among those who vote for the four 
government parties would vote yes to the EU today. This is a 
slightly lower level than in May, when the figure was 56 percent. 
  The yes-side has shrunk a little among Moderates and Center 
Party supporters, but increased among Liberal Party supporters. 
  In June, 27 percent of those who vote for the nonsocialist 
parties would vote no. The Center Party and the Christian 
Democratic Community Party still have a majority of opponents of 
the EU among their voters. 
  Among Social Democrats and supporters of the Left Party a 
majority -- 53 percent -- would vote no. 
  However, the yes-side has increased by 4 percentage points 
since May. 
  Among Social Democrats the yes-side has increased from 18 
percent in May to 23 percent in June. The no-side has increased 
from 49 to 51 percent, while the proportion of those undecided 
has fallen by 7 percent. 
  The proportion of undecided voters is somewhat higher for 
the 
Social Democrats plus the Left Party than for the nonsocialist 
parties -- 26 percent against 21 percent. 
  Men remain much more positive toward the EU than women -- 37 
percent of men say yes against 25 percent of women. But women 
are also more undecided than men. 
  Of the different age groups the youngest, 18- to 
29-year-olds, are most negative toward the EU -- a total of 55 
percent say no. 
  The only age group which has a majority for EU membership is 
45- to 59-year-olds. There the positions is 40 percent for and 
34 against. 
  Those who have made up their minds for or against the EU 
were 
asked a follow-up question about how firm they are in their 
choice. 
  Among EU supporters 86 percent are firm in their choice, a 
marginal decrease since May. 
  Among opponents of the EU, 91 percent are firm in their 
choice -- a figure that has increased somewhat over the most 
recent polls. 
  The proportion of firm noes among those interviewed is 
clearly bigger than the proportion of firm yeses -- 39 percent 
against 28 percent. 
  In May the figures were 37-27.

    [Editorial Report] According to Swedish political 
observers, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] predominance in the 
polls -- currently over 50 percent to 21.8 for the Moderates -- 
can either be an advantage for the government or an 
insurmountable lead. Quoted in an article by Mats Knutson in 
SVENSKA DAGBLADET on 3 June, Peter Esaiasson of the Central 
Statistical Bureau points out that no party in history has ever 
overcome such a deficit. His colleague Soren Holmberg believes, 
however, that the lead might be an advantage for the government, 
enabling it to campaign as the de facto opposition, "something 
that is always easier in a campaign." He believes that the 
Social Democrats would also have an easier time mobilizing their 
own supporters if they had a slightly smaller lead. Holmberg 
claims that the government's reelection chances will be better 
if the Christian Democrats clear the hurdle needed for 
parliamentary representation but the Left Party and the Green 
Party do not; all are hovering around the 4-percent cutoff. 
"Then the margins between the government [Moderates, Liberals, 
Center, and Christian Democrats] and the Social Democrats will 
be only a few percentage points."

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today 
in Corfu--where he is staying in light of the EU summit--that 
the Greek Government is dealing calmly with statements by 
Turkish officials who are cultivating a climate of artificial 
tension; our Government wants to cool it off. Athens' message 
to Ankara is clear: There can be no form of bilateral dialogue 
as long as Turkey continues to make provocations in the Aegean. 
In any case, no possible dialogue can be held on the so-called 
overall Greek-Turkish relations, because Athens firmly believes 
that the only difference is on the limits of the continental 
shelf and referring it to the European Court in The Hague. The 
spokesman said: Everything else involves unilateral Turkish 
pursuits, violations of Greek national airspace and the Athens 
FIR [Flight Information Region], or violations of international 
law. If there are issues needing discussion outside this 
framework, they are welcome. 
  The spokesman confirmed that the Greek ambassador in Ankara 
recently lodged demarches with the Turkish Government because of 
violations by Turkish aircraft in the Aegean. He said: There is 
no Muslim minority issue. Greece fully respects the Lausanne 
Treaty. Venizelos noted that mutual respect for this treaty 
could be the only issue of discussion. 
  New Democracy Vice President Ioannis Varvitsiotis asked 
Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou to raise the issue of Turkish 
provocations at the EU summit. Varvitsiotis said: Greece's 
borders are also European borders. Papandreou must not let this 
opportunity go to waste. He must finally realize that he must 
forestall events, not follow them. The issue of Greek-Turkish 
relations cannot tolerate any additional wrong moves. He 
stressed that lately, Turkish provocations have peaked 
dangerously with the tolerance of the Greek Government, which is 
taking the path of guilty silence. The violations of Greek 
national airspace exceed those of the past. Greek reaction 
against the armed Turkish fighter planes is leniently subdued, 
if not nonexistent. Varvitsiotis concluded: Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller recently confirmed in the most provocative 
manner the Balkan countries' fears that the mission of the 
Turkish troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina is to support the Muslims. 
This fact is really explosive for the Balkans.

unidentified correspondent at the official dinner for the 
European Socialist Party leaders at the Imperial Palace Hotel in 
Corfu--live] 
  [Text] [Papandreou] One of the issues will be the [European 
Parliament] elections and each country's experience. But, as a 
party--we are conferring as a party--the European Socialist 
Party has internal problems, work to do, topics, and internal 
issues. Therefore, this evening is mainly an internal affair. 
Tomorrow we will talk about the real problems of Europe and our 
positions. We must always consider our positions. Our goal is 
development and support for the workers, and a Europe of the 
people not a Europe of the bankers. Our classical position 
remains. The issue is how much we are ready to do. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] One of the significant issues 
of 
the summit will be European Commission President Jacques Delors' 
succession. The information that is available so far indicates 
that there is no unanimity. Are you optimistic about the 
outcome? 
  [Papandreou] I hope there will be. I am not sure, but I hope 
so. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
declared that linking U.S. defense aid to Turkey to certain 
conditions does not conform with the Turkish-U.S. alliance, and 
the Turkish people will react to this. Yilmaz concluded his 
contacts in the United States and returned to Turkey. TRT 
correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington: 
  [Begin recording] [Yorulmaz] [passage omitted] In a news 
conference at the end of his contacts, Yilmaz said that public 
opinion and lobbies have gained importance in the United States 
in recent years. He said that Turkey should be more active with 
regard to lobbying activities. As two allied countries, Turkey 
and the United States have mutual responsibilities, Yilmaz 
pointed out. He noted that in pursuing these relations, Turkey 
takes into account world peace as well as the interests of the 
two countries. Yilmaz cited the Korean and Gulf wars as 
examples. Yilmaz remarked that linking the defense aid to 
Turkey does not conform with allied relations. 
  [Yilmaz] Given the seriousness with which Turkey has treated 
its alliance relations with the United States and the sacrifices 
it has made to fulfill these relations, Turkey has the right to 
expect the same understanding and, if necessary, the same 
sacrifice from its U.S. allies at a time when it is facing 
certain temporary difficulties. 
  [Yorulmaz] Pointing out that the Turkish people will react 
against conditional military aid, Yilmaz said: If the current 
government accepts this aid under these conditions, it will 
contradict the will of our people. Yilmaz remarked that the 
weight of Congress, public opinion, and lobbies is increasing in 
the United States, and Turkey should take this development into 
account in its relations with this country. He noted that 
anti-Turkish lobbies are currently emphasizing the human rights 
issue. 
  Yilmaz reported that, during the talks, he expressed the 
view 
that terrorism and the human rights issue should not be confused 
with one another. The Cyprus problem was also raised during the 
talks, Yilmaz explained, adding that he stressed the importance 
of the United Nations acknowledging the conciliatory attitude of 
the Turkish Cypriot side. 
  Pointing out that the Turkish economy is increasingly being 
damaged by the embargo imposed on Iraq, Yilmaz said that he 
conveyed to the U.S. Administration that this situation must be 
rectified without losing more time. He added: The only hopeful 
indication I received was that the U.S. Administration will 
support the UN procedure to renew the flow of oil in the oil 
pipeline. 
  After his news conference, Yilmaz left the United States for 
Turkey. [end recording] 
  The ANAP leader was received at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by 
party leaders and members.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has reacted strongly to 
the U.S. Senate's condition that U.S. military aid to Turkey 
"must not be used for internal security purposes." She said: 
"We could reject the aid package." Ciller said she would 
contact President Clinton on the issue and stressed that Turkey 
will regard the condition on the aid package as a U.S. request 
to "abandon the struggle against terrorism." 
  In a statement to HURRIYET yesterday, Ciller asserted: "The 
U.S. aid can be subject to no condition. It will be very wrong 
if the aid is reduced and linked with the condition that it must 
not be used for internal security purposes. As far as human 
rights are concerned, Turkey is waging a just struggle. We are 
waging a struggle against terrorism. If the United States says 
we `cannot use its military aid for internal security purposes,' 
then we will take that to mean that `we must not wage a struggle 
against terrorism.' If the aid is reduced and made conditional, 
then it will mean that the United States does not approve of our 
struggle against terrorism. But the whole world knows that 
President Clinton supports our struggle. The Senate 
Appropriations Committee's decision is confusing. The mistake 
must be rectified. I will call President Clinton when I return 
to Ankara to confer with him on the reduced and conditional aid 
package. We could reject the aid if necessary."

  [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Under Secretary 
Ozdem Sanberk left Ankara today for Baghdad to conduct contacts 
on the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline. 
  Tomorrow, Ambassador Sanberk will proceed by land from Amman 
to Baghdad, where he will meet with Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary al-Qaysi. [name as received] 
  In his news conference today, Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman announced that Sanberk is also expected to meet 
with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz and other 
government officials. 
  Recalling that Sanberk previously held contacts on the 
subject in Paris, Washington, and New York, Ataman remarked that 
these meetings focused on resolving the issue at the UN Security 
Council with a technical resolution. 
  Ataman noted that Sanberk will brief and exchange views with 
the Iraqis on the elements of such a resolution. 
  Pointing out that Turkey has not received any official 
information with regard to Iraq's stand on the matter, Ataman 
said: 
  "We hope that the oil pipeline, which constitutes a valuable 
and important investment, will be salvaged, and a humanitarian 
contribution will consequently be made to the Iraqi people 
within the framework of the United Nations."

  [Text] Ankara--The establishment of a base for Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) observers to 
Nagorno-Karabakh is in no way similar in mandate or structure to 
Provide Comfort II, an allied force stationed in Turkey to 
protect Kurds in northern Iraq, a high-level Turkish official 
said Sunday [19 June]. Riza Turmen, the Foreign Ministry 
director responsible for ties with the CSCE, told reporters that 
the "base" in Erzurum would serve as a supply center for the 
CSCE observers who would be placed in the region to supervise a 
cease-fire between Armenians and Azeris. 
  The base in Erzurun would have a staff of 10 civilians, 
Turmen said. 
  Turmen also said that the first group of 34 people was 
planned to be sent to the Caucasus as soon as a cease-fire was 
established. Two weeks later, another 64 would be dispatched and 
the number of CSCE observers would be increased to 350. Four 
Turks will also be participating in the CSCE mission, Turmen 
said. 
  The mandate of the mission will be to supervise the 
cease-fire as well as the return of refugees. 
  "This large group will need back-up facilities, and Erzurun 
was selected to be the suitable spot for such a base," he said. 
Various press reports have called the CSCE operation a "Poised 
Hammer for the Armenians," drawing parallels between the Erzurum 
base and the allied force stationed in the Southeast to deter 
Baghdad from attacking the Kurds. The Foreign Ministry has 
categorically denied any similarities.

  [Text] Ankara, June 22 (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman 
Ferhat Ataman said today that the Amnesty International report 
showed once more that it has mistaken on the situation of human 
rights practices in Turkey. 
  Ataman told his weekly press conference that the image which 
the organization attempted to portray about Turkey did not 
reflect the facts. 
  Ataman said that parliament, independent justice, and a free 
press were functioning in Turkey which has been a member of the 
democratic Western community for half a century. 
  `It is a fact that the significant fall of terrorism leads 
to 
significant improvements in human rights practices,' he said. 
  Ataman also recalled that Article 8 of the antiterror law, 
which was criticized by Amnesty, was at present discussed at 
parliamentary commissions. 
  `Turkey is a transparent democracy. Anyone may visit any 
place, like a recent visit by Western ambassadors to the 
southeast,' he said. 
  In an annual report, the human rights group singled out 
Colombia and Turkey as being particularly aggressive violators 
and said they appear to be using U.S. military aid for torture, 
military attacks on civilians and other abuses.

  [Text] Ankara/Brussels--Six Turkish Parliamentarians of 
Kurdish origin announced in Brussels on Friday [17 June] that 
they would not return to their home country for fear of 
persecution by Turkish authorities. They said they would 
continue political activities abroad and could even consider 
asking [for] political asylum. Diplomatic sources said that 
with the closing down of the country's only Kurdish-based party 
and the possible defection of elected members of parliament, 
Turkey's international human rights record was expected to 
receive a serious blow. Friday's development came a day after 
the Constitutional Court permanently disbanded the Democracy 
Party (DEP) and ordered the seizure of all its assets and 
properties. The decision was taken unanimously by members of 
the supreme court after approximately ten hours of debate. 
  "Turkey, by closing down the DEP, has shown that it is not a 
democratic judicial state," a statement issued by the deputies 
in Brussels said. "We will stay and be the voice of our 
imprisoned friends and of our disbanded party," added Remzi 
Kartal, deputy for Van province. 
  The party's attorney Hasip Kaplan and Turkish Human Rights 
Association (IHD) chairman Akin Birdal said in Ankara on Friday 
that Thursday's verdict was of a political nature. "The right 
of Kurdish people to express themselves in the Turkish 
Parliament has been snatched out of their hands," both said. 
The verdict caused an immediate reaction among human rights 
activists around the world as the closure decision was taken 
only because of two speeches made by a former party official and 
a written statement issued by DEP. 
  Late Thursday evening, a court official told journalists 
that 
the verdict was based on speeches made by DEP former chairman 
Yasar Kaya in Bonn, Germany and Irbil, northern Iraq. The final 
reason for the closure was a statement titled "Appeal for Peace" 
issued by DEP last year. All were deemed as violations of the 
Constitution and the Political Parties law. 
  Kaplan told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS on Friday that although 
the verdict was related to the two speeches Kaya had made, the 
former DEP leader was still on trial for the same speeches and 
had not yet been found guilty. 
  According to the verdict, a total of 13 members of 
parliament 
from the now-defunct party are to lose their parliamentary 
status as soon as the decision is published in the Official 
Gazette. 
  The decision opens the way for an immediate prosecution by 
the State Security Court of eight DEP deputies out of which only 
two remain in Ankara. Hours before the verdict was announced, 
six members of parliament moved to Brussels. Five are still in 
prison since early March, waiting to be indicted after their 
immunity was lifted on March 2 by Parliament. 
  According to the constitution, Turkey would have to hold 
by-elections if 24 out of the 450 seats in parliament are 
vacant. Currently there are eight vacant seats but this will go 
up to 21 once the court verdict is published in the Official 
Gazette. 
  Kaplan and the two free DEP deputies Selim Sadak (Sirnak) 
and 
Sedat Yurttas (Diyarbakir) argued Friday that this was one 
reason why the court had not included four other former DEP 
deputies in its verdict. "They were members of the party when 
the case was launched but now they claim they were not. This is 
being done only to avoid by-elections and show that the case is 
a political case," Kaplan said. 
  Currently DEP deputies Hatip Dicle (Diyarbakir), Orhan Dogan 
(Sirnak), Sirri Sakik (Mus), Ahmet Turk (Mardin) and Leyla Zana 
(Diyarbakir) are in prison waiting to be put on trial--all to 
face a prosecutors demand for capital punishment related to 
opinions they have expressed in written and verbal form. DEP 
deputies Naif Gunes (Siirt), Remzi Kartal (Van), Mahmud Kilinc 
(Adiyaman), Nizamettin Toguc (Batman), Ali Yugit (Mardin) and 
Zubeyir Aydar (Siirt) are in Brussels. 
  Only one of the four deputies formerly related to DEP, 
Mahmut 
Alinak of Sirnak province, is in detention but he as well as 
Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer Demir (Mus) and Mahmut Uyanik 
(Diyarbakir will maintain their parliamentary seats. Next week, 
the DEP deputies who have sought asylum in the West will start 
to apply to international bodies against the Constitutional 
Court decision. 
  According to the party's lawyers, they will first apply to 
the Strasbourg human rights court and will be making their 
application on three grounds. First they will argue that the 
decision was based upon the 1982 constitution which is the 
product of the Sept. 12. 1980 transition regime and thus a 
military constitution and that the verdict completely depended 
on crimes of opinion. Secondly, they will argue that the party 
was closed down owing to statements made by its former chairman 
and that according to the individuality of crime, 13 members of 
parliament are being "punished" for crimes committed by another 
individual. Thirdly, they will demand compensation. 
  According to Kaplan the party had previously applied to the 
court asking for a postponement of the verdict pending the 
result of a parliamentary effort to amend the Turkish 
constitution. 
  Kaplan said Thursday's decision showed that this petition 
had 
been rejected but that the court had not even given an 
explanation. On Wednesday all deputies, provincial and district 
executives of DEP had submitted their resignations to avoid 
being banned from founding or heading a new party for at least 
ten years.

  [Text] Diyarbakir, June 23 (A.A.) -- Regional Emergency 
Supra-Governor Unal Erkan said on Wednesday [22 June] that the 
separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization was abducting children rather than the adults. 
  `The terror organization has massacred 4,000 citizens in 10 
years,' Erkan said. `A thousand of these have been women and 
children.' 
  Erkan arrived in Mus to receive information on the problems 
of the region. After being briefed by Mus Governor Ahmet Refik 
Tekerek, he visited the mayor in his office. 
  Proceeding to the Varto township, Erkan chatted with the 
residents. 
  Addressing citizens gathered at a coffee house, Erkan said 
that they will eradicate the terror organization. 
  `Do not let the collaborators of this organization survive. 
A single collaborator can bring turmoil to the whole place. Do 
inform the state whenever you see one,' he said. 
  `The separatist organization is dragging children, not 
adults 
to mountains. It has so far massacred 4,000 people here. Is 
this the state they are promising?' He said. 
  `The state will construct 12,000 houses in this region this 
year for the citizens fleeing terrorists,' he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Yilmaz] </F>
  [Text] Ankara--Although there is a temporary hush over the 
Kurdish region of northern Iraq, it belies the tension that 
continues to simmer between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) 
and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Until the 
cease-fire between the KDP and PUK was signed earlier this week, 
violent clashes erupted dividing the two groups and creating an 
atmosphere of instability in the area. All the while, the 
separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed in 
Turkey, had been stepping up its own efforts to seize the 
initiative in the region. 
  In fact, Turkey is worried that the PKK might be 
manipulating 
the conflict by providing aid to the PUK. This fear reportedly 
led Turkish officials to warn the PUK not to collaborate with 
the PKK during the KDP-PUK meeting held in the Turkish border 
town of Silopi on Monday [6 June]. 
  Despite Turkish worries, the PKK has maintained that it is 
making considerable efforts to end the clashes between the 
feuding Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. Yet it is clear that 
the PKK has been exploiting the instability caused by the 
clashes to expand their activities and influence in the region, 
by holding meetings, making declarations and distributing 
propaganda in favor of the organization's separatist ideology. 
Their targets are the Turkish fugitives that supposedly fled 
the fighting in southeastern Turkey to find safer havens in the 
border towns of northern Iraq. The PKK apparently sees the 
Turkish refugees as a valuable resource and potential force to 
be tapped into in the future. Sources close to the PKK have 
confirmed this view, saying that the refugees could later join 
in the PKK's struggle against the Turkish state. 
  PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, trying to draw attention to his 
organization, asserted that the problem of the Kurds is now an 
international problem and added that the establishment of peace 
in the region depended on the resolution of the Kurdish problem 
in Turkey. He also claimed that the people of the "North" and 
those of the "South" had united following the migration of 
Kurdish-origin Turks to northern Iraq. 
  Taking his vision of a united "North" and "South" one step 
further, Ocalan introduced the concept of a "Greater Kurdistan" 
and reportedly contacted the KDP and PUK in an attempt to 
interest them in the idea. 
  After the emigration of approximately 20,000 Kurds from the 
regions of Turkey close to the border, neutral observers say 
that these emigrants might join in the clashes in the future. 
"These people, who fled when their villages and their houses 
were burnt down, are already living through a war. Most of 
their children are among the guerrillas and they might join in 
the fighting too," say the sources. Whether they do or not 
remains to be seen, but it is obvious that Turkey will have some 
difficult questions to answer when international talks on the 
20,000 emigrants begin. 
  The PKK aims to gain strength in the North with the 
migration 
to Northern Iraq. All the migrants are people whose houses and 
villages had been demolished in military operations and who are 
claimed by Turkish officers to be supporters of the PKK. It is 
most likely that such people will be force into the arms of the 
PKK. 
  The PKK is in a difficult situation after the destruction of 
the villages from which the organization obtains most of its 
logistic support. Its declared aim of concentrating its 
activities in areas known as "pilot regions," fits with the 
strategy of a "Greater Kurdistan." 
  It is known that the PKK is in agreement and collaboration 
with the PUK and that the KDP is much concerned by this 
collaboration. Turkey shares the same feelings as the KDP, as 
the Peshmergas of the KDP are not skilled in warfare. Indeed, 
the PKK has a clear superiority over both the KDP and the PUK in 
this sense and this is the underlying reason for all the 
anxiety. In addition to this, the Turkish military faces 
problems in initiating operations in Northern Iraq as the PKK 
shifts its forces there. The migration of people from border 
regions to deep inside Iraqi territory will make matters even 
worse. It is even predicted that the UN might intervene with 
the situation in such a state of confusion. 
  Another development that gives encouragement to the PKK is 
the interest shown by certain groups within the KDP towards the 
PKK. It was stated that the Peshmergas that were sent to the 
Turkish border began cooperating with the PKK 2-3 months later 
and that the situation deteriorated as more Peshmergas arrived 
in the region. Rumors said that around 600 families were to 
emigrate from Halepce to Turkey because of the clashes between 
the KDP and the PUK. Even though they have not been 
ascertained, these rumors are in accord with Ocalan's 
declarations. Ocalan says, "There are Northerners who went to 
the South. The North has already united with the South." This 
statement reflects the primary condition of the PKK for the 
application of the strategy for a "Greater Kurdistan." The 
important thing for PKK members is not the action taken by the 
leaders or the organizations but the relations between peoples. 
Significantly, the PKK have left a door open to the KDP. "We do 
not want everything for ourselves. The important thing is the 
harmony between the ideals for Kurdistan. We would even support 
Barzani if he achieves this. The important thing is unity," 
they say. The PKK hopes to profit from the situation created as 
the groups in the KDP that regard the PKK with sympathy put 
pressure on Barzani. 
  The PKK claims that the establishment of peace in the Middle 
East depends on a solution to the Kurdish problem, now assuming 
the dimensions of an international issue. For that reason the 
PKK is trying to seize the initiative in Northern Iraq. 
However, if we consider that four large countries--Turkey, 
Iraq, Iran and Syria-- are involved in this issue, we can only 
wait and see whether these efforts will succeed or not. We 
ought to deliver PUK leader Talabani's message: "Do not fear 
our collaboration with the PKK." The region continually gives 
birth to new developments. In Turkey one hears the words, "PKK 
members are also our children." Could this be interpreted as a 
good omen?

<F P=106> [Report by Baran Dural: "A Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian </F>
Alliance!"] 
  [Text] As was the case before the concept of the new world 
order was launched, the Middle East continues to be a region 
where the superpowers struggle to establish their own areas of 
influence. During the Cold War years, the United States and the 
Soviet Union struggled for hegemony over that region. Now, the 
Middle East has started to gain a new status. In line with the 
concept of the new world order launched by the United States 
after the Gulf war, new balances are taking shape in the region. 
Israel, too, is doing all it can for the success of the 
autonomous Palestinian administration which has been 
established, in the first stage, in Gaza and Jericho. When the 
White House pushed for a solution in line with the new world 
order, Israel and the Palestinians, who had been enemies for 
many years, sat at the negotiating table, and the smell of 
gunfire which had seeped into the region began to disperse. 
  The thing is, however, that these countries that are 
interested in the Middle East with its rich oil reserves and 
important geographical position, have not stopped playing to 
their own hands as well. One wing of the U.S. Administration 
posits the green belt project against Tehran, which wants to 
export the Islamic revolution and which seems to have had 
relative success as we can see in Lebanon, Egypt, and the 
occupied territories in Israel. This wing calls for a "moderate 
Islam" in certain Middle East countries, including Turkey, 
against the fundamentalism of Iran. 
  Germany, which emerged as the strongest power in Europe 
after 
it united with its "communist half," is trying to join with Iran 
and Iraq against its rival, the United States. Japan comes up 
with attractive offers to expand its existing markets. Starting 
to act in line with the nationalists headed by Zhirinovskiy, who 
was victorious in the elections, and also in line with the 
"imperial" demands of the former Red Army, Russia aims at 
returning to the Middle East which it had left for the United 
States. 
  As for Israel, which has military and economic advantages, 
it 
wants to assume a role as an independent force in the regional 
balance and to find new allies to suit the conditions. 
  The developments taking place in the Middle East are so 
interesting that the strategists thinking about the area get 
lost among the large number of possible combinations every new 
rapprochement brings. 
  With the establishment of the Israeli-Palestinian peace, a 
Palestine waiting to be built and several giant projects 
emerged. The fight to take a bigger share of the Middle Eastern 
market now makes it necessary to set up new power unions and 
this turns into a multipolar struggle for balances. The 
formulas posited to change the economic and political balances 
in the Middle East are based in particular on the premise that 
Iran and Iraq each take a smaller share of the cake. You can 
expect a struggle among the Western allies who will share the 
cake, and you can also expect the struggle to eliminate some of 
the allies and replace them with others. Consequently, it should 
not be surprising if the first internal confrontation among the 
Western allies of the new world order era takes place in the 
Middle East. 
  Actually, the forces inside and outside the region realize 
that reconstruction is essential. Israel remains alone among 
its neighboring Arab states with its advanced technology in the 
industrial and agricultural fields, with its qualified cadres, 
great foreign trade volume, sound economy, and superior military 
power. Aware of its position, Israel prefers to be an active 
factor in the Middle East market, and not an important pawn of 
the many allies -- headed by the United States and Germany -- in 
the continuing struggle to share the cake. Israel plans to set 
on its path with "powerful allies" so that it can succeed in its 
strategy that is bound to disturb the United States in the long 
run. 
<H5>  New Horizons </H5>
  Israel has carefully selected the countries wooed for 
partnership. Now that it has brought the Palestinian issue up 
to a certain point, Israel wants to explore new horizons. These 
new horizons include Turkey and Egypt. Israel has practically 
secured Turkey's cooperation. Agreement was reached between the 
two countries to cooperate in several fields months before the 
colorful Israeli-PLO autonomy agreement was reached in Cairo on 
4 May, during Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin's visit to Israel as 
well as during the successive visits to Turkey of Israeli 
President 'Ezer Weizman and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  The Israeli media is also speculating on the possible 
targets 
and nature of future cooperation. The LINK magazine, which is 
known for its close contacts with intelligence sources, 
allocated 10 pages to Turkey in its May 1994 issue. In its 
articles entitled "New Administrations in the Eastern 
Mediterranean," "Risk Versus Reward," "Turkey: Its Potential 
and Problems," and "Natural Partner," the magazine studies the 
current and possible future state of bilateral economic, 
commercial, and political relations. The introduction to the 
study notes: "Geopolitical considerations establish a direct 
link between Turkey and Israel, the key allies of the West 
located on the edge of the Mediterranean. Turkey has the heavy 
industry to build the body of F-16's, and Israel can supply high 
technology in aeronautics. The two economies complement one 
another. Turkey, with its Euphrates and Tigris Rivers, holds 
the key to the water resources in the Middle East. Israel, 
which utilizes water most effectively, on the other hand, also 
has high agricultural technology. There are obstacles to the 
south and north (Syria) of the two countries. However, the two 
countries must enter the global market and act in accordance 
with the new conditions created in the eastern Mediterranean in 
the wake of the Cold War." 
<H5>  The Common Enemy </H5>
  The studies appear to have been carefully written by Michael 
Eilan and Jonathan Fedler. In his article, Eilan frequently 
refers to Weizman's views on Turkey and proposes an alliance 
against a common enemy: "We have entered a process of 
realignment in the Middle East. This process forces certain 
sides to strengthen their relations and undertake joint action. 
The contacts conducted with Turkey so far have demonstrated 
that both sides favor closer cooperation in the economic as well 
as political fields. The fact that Turkey and Israel failed to 
establish closer ties until now on the basis of political 
reservations undermines the interests of the two countries. 
Given the possibility that the confusion in the Middle East 
could lead to new threats of war at any moment, it is becoming 
clear that forces whose interests converge should leave old 
prejudices aside." 
  Against what and whom will this alliance be formed, an 
alliance which Israeli officials dwell upon at every 
opportunity? Later on in his article, Eilan discusses this 
issue. He charges that radical Islamic forces are gradually 
beginning to take control of the balances in the Middle East and 
that Iran-backed movements such as Hezbollah, Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, and Hezb-e Eslami are 
continuously gaining strength. Eilan claims that Turkey and 
Israel should form an alliance against radical Islam and assume 
a decisive role in the region. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, in a statement to the 28 May issue of HURRIYET, also 
remarked that a stability triangle to be established by Turkey, 
Israel, and Egypt is necessary. Referring to this trio, Rabin 
noted that "it can act against all kinds of nationalist, 
religious, Islamic, or other terrorist organizations attempting 
to overthrow legitimate governments or to change borders." 
  On the basic principles of the proposed tripartite alliance, 
Eilan expounds as follows: "The officials of the two countries 
concede that their countries are not established in a peaceful 
oasis. Syria, Iran, and Iraq are daily increasing the dose of 
political pressure and commercial obstacles. Our adversaries 
have a military mentality and it is necessary to establish a 
deterrent unity of force against them. In this context, Turkey 
and Israel seem to have discovered the importance of deterrence. 
The Turkish and Israeli Armed Forces must undertake a union 
against forces that support radical Islam." 
<H5>  Common Goal: Fundamentalism </H5>
  After positing the above proposal, LINK cannot but proceed 
to 
underline an extremely sensitive point. Pointing out that 
Israeli and Turkish officials fear the reaction of their own 
radical groups if they put their thoughts into practice, the 
magazine notes that the two countries can receive a satisfactory 
share of the Middle East cake only if they act together. The 
practical cooperation between the two countries is not 
sufficient to achieve the necessary plan, the magazine remarks, 
adding that Egypt must constitute the third flank of the 
alliance. 
  The theory proposed by Eilan with regard to the outcome of 
the Turkish-Israeli alliance is quite interesting: "Turkey is 
currently in the process of settling accounts with the 
separatist Kurds. The state is engaged in a ruthless struggle 
against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Israel, in turn, 
is waging the same struggle against the Hizballah. Providing 
logistics support to both organizations is Syria. It is 
certainly not a coincidence that Turkish leaders briefed Weizman 
on the Southeast Anatolia Project [GAP] and took him to visit 
the region. Syria is concerned about GAP's success. Turkey, if 
willing to undertake the risk, can block a significant part of 
the water flowing to Iraq via Syria. This would ruin Syria. 
Military cooperation between Turkey and Israel would dispel 
Turkey's fear of taking a risk." Claiming that Syria should 
definitely be disciplined, Eilan believes that a 
Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance would certainly eliminate the 
"Syrian threat." 
  Is the rise of Islamic fundamentalism the only factor that 
forces Israel to form an alliance with Turkey? Or, does Israel 
-- a U.S. ally -- want to take some steps outside the Green Belt 
project imposed by the Pentagon? While it is known that Israel 
differs from the United States on certain issues, it is also 
clear that Israeli leaders will not suddenly attempt to take 
radical steps. Israeli bureaucrats believe that Ankara, which 
is cooperating with Tel Aviv, will secure a rapprochement 
between Israel and some Arab countries. Israeli officials, who 
stress that countries other than Turkey, Israel, and Egypt 
should also receive their fair share of the Middle East cake, 
believe that Turkey will build the bridge which will extend to 
the Central Asian Turkic republics. 
<H5>  The Plan To Restrain Iran </H5>
  No doubt, Israel attaches great importance to the newly 
independent Turkic republics. Israel, which is unable to reach 
out to these republics because of Iran's influence over the 
region, is hoping to overcome the Tehran obstacle through the 
alliance it wants to establish. Israeli businessmen, who until 
now managed to carry supplies to the Caucasus using Turkish 
firms as brokers, faced difficulties when Iran, becoming aware 
of the situation, imposed new quotas on Turkey. In addition to 
the new quotas, Tehran increased the transit fee from Turkey 
through Iran from $400 to $810 and also imposed an additional 
$250 service charge. Israel, which realizes that it cannot get 
through to Iran by itself, wants to create pressure on the 
Tehran administration through the new alliance. 
  Israel's alliance proposal will also act as "a young and 
lively regional pact" in the Middle East. This new possible 
alliance, which some strategists describe as "the common market 
of the Middle East," will also turn into a principled economic 
power in due course. LINK outlines the basic guidelines of the 
Turkish-Israeli economic cooperation project using the words of 
Turkish businessman Uzeyir Garih: "Skilled and unskilled work 
force. This is the most important factor bringing Turkey and 
Israel together. There are many skilled workers in Israel. 
Turkey, in turn, is the paradise of unskilled manpower. 
Joining these two work forces will serve the interests of both 
countries." 
  In actual fact, Israel did not merely prepare the manifesto 
of the alliance it plans to establish. In a statement he issued 
recently, Weizman also revealed the economic base of the 
Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian alliance. Emphasizing that PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat realized that he must sit at the negotiating table 
with Israel if Palestine's interests are to be protected, 
Weizman declared that the newly autonomous Palestinian 
territories will act as the economic center of he alliance and 
that Palestinian leaders have acknowledged this idea on 
principle. 
  Given the fact that Turkey and Egypt will maintain close 
relations with Islamic countries and that the alliance of these 
three countries will force Iran, Iraq, and Syria, which 
constantly create problems in the Middle East, to reassess their 
current policies, it is understood that U.S. leaders will not 
oppose this alliance -- at least not at the beginning. 
Furthermore, it is suggested that the United States, which 
knows that Israel has its own independent plan, will want to 
"supervise" the Israeli Administration by means of Turkey and 
Egypt. 
<H5>  The Attitude of the United States </H5>
  The picture presented so far is very rosy, but Israel 
harbors 
serious concerns with regard to Turkey. Like the West, Israel 
also wants Turkey, at the very least, to resolve its Kurdish 
problem and implement the democratization measures promised by 
the government. In his statement to HURRIYET, Rabin said: "We 
are granting autonomy to the Palestinians. We support other 
countries' (including northern Iraq) autonomy plans as well." 
Rabin was indirectly conveying the message that the Kurdish 
problem must be solved. 
  Apart from political problems, Israeli businessmen who trade 
with Turkey repeatedly stress that Turkey is a great economic 
risk. According to Israeli businessmen, who note that Turkey, 
Israel, and Egypt have not yet reached a level where they can 
finance one another, the Turkish Government should find a 
solution to the problem of inflation. If Turkey restores order 
in its economy and utilizes its water resources in a rational 
manner, and if the Egyptian Administration does not ignore 
Israel's appeal, then a very strong and promising union can 
emerge in the Middle East. 
  One does not have to be a prophet to guess that this union 
will be faced with a fierce diplomatic offensive particularly 
during its initial stages. This new alliance, which will 
disturb especially Russia and Armenia, will be forced to 
struggle against the schemes of these two countries on the one 
hand, and against the United States and the Germany-Iran-Iraq 
bloc, on the other.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Interior Minister Franz </F>
Loeschnak and Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin by Robert 
Stoppacher in Vienna on 22 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Stoppacher] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
crime has risen dramatically in the successor states. Organized 
crime is a particularly serious problem. About 2,000 to 3,000 
gangs specialized in extorting protection money, illegal deals, 
and speculation are now active in Russia. According to the 
Austrian Interior Ministry, money of the so-called Russian mafia 
is also reaching Austria. This problem was also a major issue 
that was discussed during the working visit to Austria by 
Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin. 
  Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak and his Russian 
counterpart 
mainly discussed drug trafficking, economic crime, and 
immigration problems. The two officials are resolved to take 
joint action, particularly in the fight against organized crime. 
An intensive exchange of information should help stop criminal 
activities by Russian gangs. The Russian mafia -- a term that 
Loeschnak's opposite number does not like -- is to be stopped. 
Austrian authorities have received information recently that 
enormous sums resulting from Russian crime are being invested in 
Austria through the establishment of various companies that 
specialize in trade and the procurement of goods. 
  Interior Minister Loeschnak spoke of companies that 
obviously 
serve organized crime. 
  [Loeschnak] In addition, there are individual cases of 
companies in Austria and in Russia that have only one or two 
employees and an office with a telephone, but which have a 
turnover of hundreds of millions of schillings. Thus, one must 
ask whether there is something fishy about these companies, and 
whether the money that is being deposited has been earned in 
noncriminal activity. There have been several such cases in the 
past few months. Thus, in the event of dubious deals, we will 
increasingly investigate, with the support of the Russian 
executive bodies and on the basis of the existing banking laws 
in Austria, where the money comes from. 
  [Stoppacher] Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin reported 
the following on the structure of organized crime in Russia. 
  [Yerin] The connection between economic and everyday crime 
is 
typical of organized crime. Moreover, these groups are bribing 
public employees. Thus, you can rest assured that we will 
inform you fully on their activities after a full investigation. 
  [Stoppacher] Thus, the Russian mafia, international drug 
trafficking, and the smuggling of refugees is to be fought 
together with the Austrian authorities. Viktor Yerin also 
stressed that nobody needs to be afraid of a wave of emigration 
to Austria, involving millions of Russian, as has repeatedly 
been mentioned by the media. The situation has already 
stabilized to a certain extent in Russia. Numerous Russians 
even want to return to home.

  [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun (BELGA) -- Russia officially signed 
the Partnership for Peace program [PFP], which provides for 
closer cooperation with NATO, on Wednesday [22 June]. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev signed the PFP, 
implementing 
the NATO-Russia cooperation agreement, mainly in the military 
sphere, which the alliance proposed to other European countries 
and especially to its former Cold War enemies. 
  Addressing the ambassadors of NATO's 16 member countries at 
the alliance's Brussels Headquarters, the Russian foreign 
minister stated that "the preparation of an important 
Russian-NATO cooperation program has been launched. We have 
agreed on a large and profound dialogue as well as cooperation 
on issues in which Russia could make a substantial and unique 
contribution, corresponding to its importance and its 
responsibilities as major nuclear power in Europe and in the 
world." U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher attended the 
signing ceremony.

  [Text] Brussels (DPA) -- The heads of government and party 
chairmen of the christian democratic parties in the European 
Union [EU] are meeting in Brussels on 22 June to coordinate 
policy for the forthcoming EU summit. 
  Their talks will be focused on a successor to European 
Commission Chairman Jacques Delors. The two most promising 
candidates for the top office, which will be vacant in January 
1995 -- Belgian Premier Jean-Luc Dehaene and Netherlands head of 
government Ruud Lubbers, both of them Christian democrats --will 
take part in the meeting, as will Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Observers are hoping for a preliminary decision by the 
Christian democrats, which form the European People's Party 
group in the European Parliament. The socialist Jacques Delors 
will have a Christian democratic successor, who will be selected 
by the EU heads of state and government at their summit meeting 
on the Greek island of Corfu on 24 and 25 June. 
  Kohl's preferred candidate is Dehaene, who is apparently 
backed by the majority of the "Twelve." If the leadership of 
the European People's Party opts for one of the candidates, this 
vote will be decisive for the EU summit. The possibility has 
not been ruled out, however, that no vote will be taken, in 
order to avoid a conflict. Both candidates are considered 
"highly qualified" for the top position at EU headquarters. 
  The European People's Party leaders will also discuss the 
outcome of the EU parliamentary elections.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German cabinet today approved 
sending 70 German police officers to the town of Mostar, which 
was destroyed in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According 
to government spokesman Dieter Vogel, the police will take part 
in a civilian operation by the Western European Union [WEU], 
which is also to be supported by the administrative authorities 
in Mostar. 
  The WEU police contingent will be made up of a total of 200 
police officers. The cabinet approved Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel's view that a stronger international police element was 
necessary for the success of the European Union [EU]-appointed 
administrator, SPD [Social Democratic Party] politician Hans 
Koschnick, Vogel said. 
  The precondition for the start of the EU's administration in 
Mostar and sending the police was the complete demilitarization 
of the town under the supervision of the UN Protection Force, 
Vogel said. The police would only work "in safe surroundings." 
If the security situation did not meet the strict requirements 
of the EU, then the administration would be suspended and the 
personnel withdrawn. 
  Germany will make 50 new 20-tonne low-loaders available to 
the United Nations for "urgently required" heavy goods transport 
in war-torn Yugoslavia. The United Nations will also be given 
16 German experts to deal with the opening and starting up of 
the airport in Tuzla. The German Government is also willing to 
get involved in aid flights with Bundeswehr aircraft once the 
airport is open.

  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France launched its 
UN-mandated mercy mission to protect minority Tutsis in 
southwestern Rwanda overnight, flying in troops and equipment to 
the Rwandan-border, military officials said here Thursday [23 
June]. 
  The operation started hours after the UN Security Council on 
Wednesday gave lukewarm support to a two-month mission by 
French-led troops to stop the ethnic carnage in the central 
African nation. 
  French officials said none of the 2,500 French soldiers 
assigned to Operation Turquoise had yet crossed into Rwanda, 
where up to 500,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis have been 
killed since the April 6 death of the president of Rwanda, a 
Hutu, in an unexplained plane crash. 
  The UN Security Council authorized the mission, expected to 
comprise 2,500 French troops and some Senegalese, to use all 
means necessary to assure the protection of displaced people, 
refugees and civilians in the African state. 
  The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, 
which 
controls about two-thirds of the country, accuse France of 
backing the government and have warned that they would consider 
any French intervention as hostile. 
  The French officials said French forces were being ferried 
to 
the Zairean military bases of Goma and Bukavu near the Rwandan 
border while French Air Force Jaguar planes were flown from the 
Central African Republic to Kisangani airport in northeastern 
Zaire in a support role. 
  French General Jean-Claude Lafourcade, who commands 
Operation 
Turquoise, left Paris late Wednesday to join his expeditionary 
force, which includes 1,000 troops from France and 1,500 
stationed in Gabon and Djibouti. 
  France said Wednesday that its soldiers would cross the 
Rwandan border from Zaire starting Thursday morning on a 
strictly humanitarian mission. 
  Thursday afternoon, between 500 and 600 men were to deployed 
on Goma and Bukavu and the foray into the soutwestern Rwandan 
region of Cyangugu will then be envisaged. France said 8,000 
Tutsis were surrounded by Hutu-dominated government forces in 
that region. 
  The UN Security Council also obliged the troops to be 
impartial in the battle between majority Hutus and minority 
Tutsis that erupted 2-1/2 months ago. 
  The vote was 10-0 with five countries abstaining: Brazil, 
China, Nigeria, New Zealand and Pakistan. 
  The force would be deployed for a maximum of two months to 
protect civilians from massacres until the arrival of 
reinforcements for the UN Mission in Rwanda, which now has 500 
soldiers and military advisers. 
  The Security Council last month passed a resolution 
approving 
the expansion of the UN mission by 5,000 peacekeepers. But a 
lack of equipment and logistical support has delayed their 
deployment.

<F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Ahtisaari's Group Not a Vote </F>
of No Confidence in Government"] 
  [Text] President Martti Ahtisaari does not think that he 
trespassed on the government's territory and overstepped his 
powers when he appointed his own working group to discuss 
employment. 
  Ahtisaari himself gave prominence to his working group as 
his 
most important message at the press conference he arranged 
yesterday at Tamminiemi. Remarkably enough in his introductory 
remarks he made no mention of the historic decision made an hour 
earlier to grant the authority to sign the EU [European Union] 
agreement. 
  Ahtisaari dismissed the suggestion that the appointment of 
his working group can in any way be seen as a vote of no 
confidence in the government. In a somewhat irritated tone he 
rejected suggestions that this means that he is dissatisfied 
with the government. 
  He said that he wanted to arrange a clear link with the 
government by appointing the Labor Ministry's administrative 
director as the group's general secretary. 
  The president did not allow himself to be drawn into any 
discussion of the constitutional aspects of the matter -- 
something on which criticism has concentrated. Asked his view 
of the criticism he simply replied: "I have not heard anyone 
who is unemployed saying this." 
  He justified his move by saying that the reduction of 
unemployment down to a tolerable level is a major national issue 
which not even the president can disregard. 
  "It is as important as the relocation of the evacuated 
population and the payment of war compensation were in their 
day. Perhaps we were successful then because there was national 
unity," he said. 
  The group includes Matti Pekkanen, the retired director of 
the Central Association of the Forestry Industry, Nokia managing 
director Jorma Ollila, director Jukka Pekkarinen of the 
Employees' Research Institute, Maj-Len Remahl, the chairman of 
the retail workers' trade union, Labor Ministry administrative 
director Pertti Sorsa, and Professor Antti Tanskanen. Pekkanen 
acts as the group's chairman and Sorsa as its general secretary. 
  According to Ahtisaari, the goal should be that before the 
end of the century unemployment should fall to 200,000. "I have 
assumed that temporarily at least we should dare to also adopt 
exceptional, even radical measures," the president said. 
  The working group will present a report to Ahtisaari before 
the end of September. He is unwilling to anticipate at the 
present time what will happen then. 
  President Ahtisaari admitted that the Center Party congress 
did have some effect on the fact that the authority to sign the 
EU agreement was granted yesterday. "For me it did not matter 
whether is happened on Friday or on Monday -- as long as it 
happened in good time before the meeting (on Corfu next 
weekend)," he said. 
  Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen has 
criticized the government for not reaching a decision on the 
authority to sign the agreement last week and instead putting 
the decision off until after the Center Party congress. 
  Ahtisaari will also travel to Corfu along with the 
government's representatives, and he himself will deliver 
Finland's five-minute address to the meeting. 
  He gave no firm answer when asked whether the legislation 
covering the national support package should be completed by the 
Eduskunta before the EU referendum -- a condition laid down by 
the Center Party. 
  "This depends entirely on whether people manage to give full 
consideration to the laws in time. But I do not think that 
anyone wants to slow them down," he said. 
  According to Ahtisaari, the question of whether the support 
package is a precondition for joining the EU should be decided 
by each party individually. However, he is also hoping for 
broad national consensus on the support package. "I have not 
met a single Finnish politician who would have said that there 
is no need for a support package. There may be differing views 
about the details -- for what length of time the package's 
measures should remain in force, for example," he said. 
  Asked about the EU Commission's position on the support 
package Ahtisaari said that the Commission's consideration of 
the package has not even begun yet, but that he had not heard 
that anyone had said that the package is absolutely unacceptable. 
  Ahtisaari said that this fall he himself will make a number 
of public appearances in the context of the EU question, at a 
UKK seminar on 3 September, for example. But in the field of 
foreign and security policy he does not intend to express any 
new ideas during the course of the fall. 
  "We have made our position known and it has been accepted by 
the EU. If the Finnish people decides that we should join, we 
will have a lot of time next year to discuss and prepare 
ourselves for the intergovernmental conference in 1996. Then we 
will also be able to see more clearly how thinking on these 
issues is developing in Europe as a whole. There is no need to 
have this discussion this fall," he said. 
  Ahtisaari also revealed that last week he ate lunch with his 
predecessor, Mauno Koivisto. He hopes to be able to meet 
Koivisto again later this summer, perhaps on the volleyball 
court at [presidential summer residence] Kultaranta. 
  Ahtisaari traveled out to Kultaranta yesterday afternoon.

  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has described the 
plan to converge the Greek economy with the economies of the 
European countries as achievable and one that takes into account 
social circumstances. Papandreou made his statement upon 
arrival at Corfu Airport. The direction of the economy does not 
concern me, he said. We are not magicians but we have a 
convergence plan that can be achieved and that takes into 
account social circumstances, Papandreou stressed. The prime 
minister said there will be an amendment to the Maastricht 
Treaty in 1996 and that perhaps we will see significant changes 
in the direction of the economies of many European countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Rauf Gerz: "Officials Fear Aircraft From Romania </F>
Transporting Arms to Yemen"] 
  [Text] Cargo planes from Romania are believed to have 
transported large quantities of arms to north Yemen since the 
outbreak of the war in Yemen. Cargo planes fly from Romania to 
Yemen through Turkey's airspace twice every night. The flights 
and the weight of cargo have led officials to consider the 
possibility that arms are being supplied from Romania to Yemen. 
  Gigantic Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo planes have taken 
off 
at night from Otopeni Airport in Bucharest to fly to Sanaa in 
north Yemen for the past 20 days. The next day they returned 
empty. The aircraft reportedly obtained permission to transport 
vegetables through Turkey's airspace. The aircraft maintained 
the same flight route. They entered Turkey's airspace from the 
"Rixan" air corridor over the Black Sea and left it over 
Antalya. The Ilyushin-76 aircraft, the largest cargo planes in 
the world, fly at 24,000 feet (8,000 meters) when they cross 
through Turkey's airspace, although that altitude is not 
economic for such aircraft on long-distance flights. 
Considering the planes' altitude, military aviation experts 
have said they may be carrying arms. An expert said: "Cargo 
planes may fly at a higher altitude even if they are fully 
loaded with tomatoes. I do not believe the cargo they transport 
exceeds 150 tonnes. A cargo that heavy can only be made up of 
arms." 
  Turkey has no right to place the cargo aircraft under its 
control, because there is no UN ban on arms to Yemen. But the 
Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe gives it the right to 
search any aircraft in its airspace that it believes to be 
carrying a cargo of arms.

afternoon and at 2000 will be received by President Glavkos 
Kliridhis. The spokesman also said that UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali had a telephone conversation with President 
Kliridhis last night and announced his intention to send Clark 
to Cyprus. Kliridhis, the spokesman added, asked Butrus-Ghali 
whether Clark would be carrying any letter. Butrus-Ghali said 
Clark would not. The government spokesman added that tonight's 
discussion at the presidential palace will concern the UN 
secretary general's report, which was submitted to the Security 
Council on 30 May, and particular emphasis will be placed upon 
Butrus-Ghali's proposals. 
  The spokesman repeated that the Greek Cypriot side's 
position 
remains clear: Discussion of the confidence-building measures 
has ended and we remain committed to the 21 March document. 
Answering a question, the government spokesman stressed that 
our side will not yield to pressure from the United States and 
Britain. 
  Finally, the spokesman said that President Kliridhis will 
leave for Corfu tomorrow morning on board a private plane 
instead of this afternoon as scheduled.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis departed this morning 
for Corfu, where this evening he will have a private meeting 
with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Following that 
meeting, Kliridhis and Papandreou will meet EU Commission 
President Jacques Delors. 
  Replying to questions prior to his departure from Larnaca 
Airport regarding last night's meeting with Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative on Cyprus, President 
Kliridhis said that Clark conveyed a series of messages from the 
United Nations and received a series of answers. The president 
said that the Greek Cypriot side's positions remain the same. 
Our side, he stressed, insists on the 21 March document and we 
do not accept anything other than that document. The UN's 
desire, Kliridhis added, was to see whether it would be possible 
for us to accept what was agreed upon in Vienna in the absence 
of the Greek Cypriot side, and they got a very clear message 
that something like that will not happen. President Kliridhis 
also said that he discussed with Clark all options included in 
the UN secretary general's report. However, he added that Clark 
was not authorized to say which option would be preferred by the 
Security Council members or which option the UN secretary 
general would suggest. 
  Called on to comment on British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd's statement, that the two sides in Cyprus have come close 
to agreement, President Kliridhis said that he had not realized 
that we were very near an agreement. The president added that 
there is an attempt to cultivate such a climate. There is an 
attempt, he said, to create the impression that the differences 
regarding the 21 March document are so small, that somehow a 
solution would be found. Our view, he said, is that the 
differences between the two sides are substantial. 
  Asked whether he is more optimistic or pessimistic following 
his meeting with Clark, President Kliridhis said that his 
position remains firm, that he insists on the 21 March document 
and if [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas finds a way to 
accept it, then his optimism will be realized. If Denktas, he 
concluded, does not find a way to accept the document, then his 
pessimism will be realized. 
  In a laconic statement after his meeting with President 
Kliridhis, Clark noted that during his meetings he examined the 
situation following the submission of the UN secretary general's 
report and there has been no discussion of anything new.

between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, at the 
Presidential Palace. 
  In a statement after the meeting, government spokesman 
Ioannis Kasoulidhis said an interesting discussion was held and 
Clark surely understood the Greek Cypriot side's positions. The 
spokesman said he believes the goal of Clark's visit is to help 
the UN Security Council formulate its decisions. The Security 
Council will discuss the UN secretary general's report. He 
said: We discussed nothing other than the 21 March document and 
we explained the reasons we do not agree with a continuation of 
the procedure.

  [Excerpts] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative in Cyprus, arrived this afternoon and will meet 
President Glavkos Kliridhis tonight. [passage omitted] 
  Clark said there is a feeling that the entire effort was 
never devoted exclusively to the confidence-building measures 
[CBM's] and that it has always been, in the UN's judgment, an 
essential way to begin the resolution of more substantive issues. 
  He denied that he was unwilling to take over the new mission 
in Cyprus, saying: I had a difficult schedule in Canada, to 
which I will return permanently in one month, and it was 
difficult to get away. He added, however, that he wanted to come 
to Cyprus and he hopes he will have constructive talks. 
  He avoided giving details of what he will discuss with 
Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas. He also 
avoided commenting on UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's 
reference to the need to find alternative ways of promoting a 
Cyprus solution. He added that we need goodwill from all sides 
to get some movement on the issue. [passage omitted] 
  A DIKO [Democratic Party] statement on Clark's arrival in 
Cyprus mentions that this is another effort to find a formula 
that will represent Ankara and Denktas as accepting the CBM's. 
DIKO calls upon the UN secretary general, the British, and the 
Americans look to Ankara and Denktas for a just solution instead 
of pushing us to make concessions to the Turkish positions and 
demands. DIKO said it is angry about this stance and concerned 
about the course of developments on the national issue. The 
party reiterated its adamant opposition to the 
confidence-building measures. 
  A Socialist party EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus] 
statement expresses concern at the continuing activity by UN 
envoys regarding the CBM's. On Clark's visit, EDEK mentions 
that this does not aim to find a new procedure but to modify the 
measures to help the Turkish side and put pressure on the 
Cypriot Government to accept an amendment to the 21 March UN 
document. In its statement, EDEK says it is time to declare the 
CBM's dead and to turn our attention toward convening an 
international conference to discuss the substance of the Cyprus 
issue on the basis of international law.

  [Text] The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] 
Council of Ministers has expressed concern that any move by 
Greece during the EU [European Union] summit in Corfu to push 
the issue of the Greek Cypriot side becoming a European Union 
member may have adverse effects on the negotiation process in 
Cyprus. The Council of Ministers met today under Prime Minister 
Hakki Atun and discussed various issues, including the latest 
developments in the Cyprus problem. Foreign and Defense 
Minister Atay Ahmet Rasit informed the correspondents while the 
meeting was still in progress that the Council of Ministers had 
assessed the developments that may take place on the Cyprus 
problem during the EU summit in Corfu. He said the following: 
  [Begin Rasit recording] The TRNC Council of Ministers feels 
there is a need to issue a statement on the 24 June EU summit on 
Corfu. The statement is as follows: 
  We are worried that the furthering of the issue of the Greek 
Cypriot side becoming a full EU member during the EU summit may 
have adverse effects on the negotiations process in Cyprus. The 
Greek Cypriot side does not represent the legitimate government 
of the whole of Cyprus, nor can it act on behalf of the Turkish 
Cypriot people. The treaty oaf 1960 clearly stipulates that 
Cyprus cannot be a part of international organizations in which 
Turkey and Greece, which are the guarantor powers of Cyprus, are 
not members. The Turkish Cypriot people's separate consent is 
required for Cyprus to become an EU member. That fact is 
outlined in UN documents. The Turkish Cypriot people are 
opposed to Cyprus becoming a member of the EU, in which Greece 
is a member and Turkey is not. Such a development, which can be 
interpreted as enosis [union with Greece], will have negative 
effects on the negotiation process. 
  Considering the continuing talks on the confidence-building 
measures in Cyprus, the intensive effort that has been made to 
further the Greek Cypriot side's application to become a full EU 
member conflicts with the initiatives that have been made to 
establish mutual confidence on the island. The Turkish Cypriot 
side has done its utmost with regard to the confidence-building 
measures. It is prepared to sign the agreement on the 
confidence-building measures if the points that were agreed upon 
in Vienna some time ago are included in it. It has the 
political will for that purpose. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Liberals" column: "Obliged to Say `No'"] </F>
  [Text] We will doubtless find ourselves in front of painful 
dilemmas, especially under the weight of great pressure. Events 
have played a direct role as they have occurred, outlining 
irreversible and ill-omened developments. These developments are 
linked with the package of confidence-building measures as far 
as we know it and are also associated with critical changes. 
The result is: 
  The already one-sided content of the confidence-building 
measures package is becoming even worse for our side; it is a 
starting point for Turkish goals. As a result, it acts against 
us in a dangerous and catalytic way. Something like this, and 
especially with our own consent, will accelerate the crisis. 
  Everything that has happened and all the backstage and 
visible efforts have come together. Things cannot be otherwise, 
because instead of condemning the Turkish side after blaming it 
for its intransigence (leading to measures to implement the UN 
decisions), we finally see "clarifications" adopted to balance 
the UN document! This was the document they asked us to accept. 
Indecently, we accepted it. 
  In light of positions that tend toward a new framework that 
overturns every condition laid down by the Security Council's 
big powers, our side must search for the most preventive 
strategy and tactic so that it will not find itself trapped in 
irreversible processes and frameworks that will lead to 
recognition [of the north of the island]. 
  No matter how difficult our position and no matter if we are 
the weak part in an oppressive and bad situation, we are obliged 
to resist unorthodox solutions, even if they are adopted by the 
United Nations. We are obliged to do that, even if these 
attempts are promoted by the centers of power and decision, 
simply because we have few options. But this does not mean we 
are abandoning realistic approaches and awareness of the need to 
compromise. On the contrary, we realize that, which is why our 
side always stresses that it accepts the 21 March document.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Has Units Ready for UN </F>
Duties"] 
  [Text] New York, 22 June -- The Netherlands has offered 
units from all sections of its Armed Forces to the United 
Nations. These units could carry out duties anywhere in the 
world with a one to four weeks' notice. 
  Defense Minister Ter Beek announced this yesterday at the UN 
headquarters after long talks with Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  A total of 3,500 military are involved in these forces, 
which 
include two frigates, two minesweepers and a support ship, a 
battalion of marines, and a Navy PC3 Orion reconnaissance 
aircraft. The Land Forces involved include an infantry battalion 
with armored vehicles, a command unit, and an engineering 
company for mine clearance and road repair. The Air Force would 
be able to supply a squadron of 18 F-16 fighter aircraft and two 
F-27 transport planes. Fifty military policemen could be 
deployed for police tasks. 
  Ter Beek said the units would fit in a UN organizational 
system enabling the secretary general to know at a glance what 
troops were available in the world, how long it would take for 
them to arrive, their specialities, and equipment. The 
Netherlands is the 18th country to follow Butrus-Ghali's call 
for a pool of military personnel for peacekeeping duties. 
  Ter Beek explained that the units could only be deployed if 
the Netherlands' Cabinet gave its approval to the UN mission and 
after the Netherlands' Parliament had been consulted. In 
addition to these units on standby for UN tasks, the Netherlands 
would also supply other troops and material for implementing UN 
peacekeeping duties at any time. 
  During his talks with Butrus-Ghali, Ter Beek repeated that 
the Netherlands did not want to send any troops to Rwanda. Ter 
Beek said that Butrus-Ghali showed understanding for the 
Netherlands' position that Netherlands soldiers looked too much 
like the Belgians, the former colonial power, and therefore 
would run extra risks. But the Netherlands would supply a 
transport plane to fly freight and military personnel for air 
traffic control into Rwanda's neighboring countries. 
  Butrus-Ghali praised the Netherlands' military efforts in 
Bosnia and Croatia. He was happy with the cabinet's intention 
to relieve the troops in Bosnia on 1 July with the 12th 
Battalion of the Airborne Brigade. "A purple coalition will not 
change this," Ter Beek said. 
  During the talks the secretary general declared that he was 
having great difficulty in carrying out UN peacekeeping duties. 
Sometimes there are not enough soldiers, often they have 
inadequate equipment, and if they are offered equipment from 
another member state then they first have to be trained in its 
use. This way precious months can be lost and the United 
Nations is unable to implement the peacekeeping decisions made 
by the Security Council. 
  He said he was very happy with the Netherlands' initiative 
to 
make a number of units permanently available. "If that could be 
done on a wider scale, Butrus-Ghali could decide quicker which 
soldiers were to be sent out, because finally he knows what he 
has in store," Ter Beek added.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Thomas Klestil by Alfred Worm: </F>
place and date not given: "Departing From the Rule in Special 
Cases"] 
  [Text] [Worm] Mr. President, we ask you for an authentic 
interpretation. According to Article 65 of the Constitution, 
the president represents the republic internationally. 
  [Klestil] The article also states: He signs state treaties. 
However, I have never left any doubt that I will delegate this 
authority. 
  [Worm] The Constitution says: According to the proposal of 
the president. 
  [Klestil] That is right. This is the power to sign state 
treaties. After all, the Constitution is the basis of our 
democracy. I have sworn an oath on it. 
  [Worm] Your predecessors have never stressed this aspect of 
the Constitution. 
  [Klestil] I know that the practices of my predecessors are a 
strong element in the assessment of a political situation. I 
have always made it clear that I will delegate this power. I 
have already done that. All other details were discussed with 
the chancellor. 
  [Worm] Why was there so much wrangling among the political 
parties after the referendum? 
  [Klestil] During the campaign for the vote, I stressed that 
I 
would assume a nonpartisan role. This is what I would like to 
signal to the European Union [EU] with my trip to Corfu. My 
presence is designed to underline the historic significance of 
the signing of this treaty. 
  [Worm] You will not sign the treaty in Corfu but you will 
make a speech. 
  [Klestil] That has been agreed. 
  [Worm] What about the European Council? 
  [Klestil] Everything that is to be implemented politically 
must be done by the government. Thus, it is quite natural for 
the chancellor and the foreign minister to represent the 
government in this body. 
  [Worm] The European Council will convene in Germany in 
December. Will you participate in this meeting? 
  [Klestil] No, I will not. 
  [Worm] Can you think of an event that might induce you to 
attend a meeting of the European Council in 1996 when the new 
security structures are adopted and when you might act as the 
supreme commander of the Austrian Army, for example? 
  [Klestil] Let me repeat once more: Basically, this will be 
the task of the government because it must implement the 
decisions. However, there might be very special occasions 
permitting a departure from the rule. 
  [Worm] What will be the "rule?" 
  [Klestil] That the chancellor and the foreign minister 
represent Austria. 
  [Worm] Are you annoyed about the refusal of the Austrian 
People's Party to allow State Secretary Brigitte Ederer to sign 
the treaty? 
  [Klestil] I have left no doubt that I will delegate the 
authority to sign the treaty. Theoretically, I would have 
considered it possible to suggest the signing of the treaty by 
two persons -- the chancellor and the foreign minister. Bearing 
in mind that Leopold Figl was the only person to sign the State 
Treaty, one could have asked only Foreign Minister Mock to sign 
the treaty with the EU. However, the government submitted a 
different proposal. 
  [Worm] Did you express surprise? 
  [Klestil] I talked with the chancellor to avoid any 
friction. 
One should not inform the other side via the Austrian Press 
Agency. 
  [Worm] Do you understand Ms. Ederer's situation? 
  [Klestil] During a discussion with her, I did not have the 
impression that she was upset. She showed great commitment 
during the negotiations. Thus, it would have been normal for 
her to sign the treaty as well. However, the parties made a 
different decision. In my view, a smaller group of persons who 
held the talks would have corresponded to the weight of the 
occasion.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ett": "Pressure for Stricter Emissions </F>
Norms; Restrictions Also for Cars From East Europe"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- After joining the European Union [EU], 
Austria will advocate the reduction of emissions from cars. 
Yesterday, Wednesday [22 June], Transportation Minister Viktor 
Klima (Social Democratic Party of Austria) made a corresponding 
statement at a press conference in Vienna. 
  His specific plans: In addition to the already valid 
regulations, unified "ecological minimum standards" -- also for 
cars from East Europe -- are to be introduced. Already at the 
next EU transportation ministers' conference on 22-23 July he 
wants to become active on the "emissions front." 
  Austrian preparations for EU membership provided the 
occasion 
for the press conference by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Klima, 
and European Affairs State Secretary Brigitte Ederer in Vienna 
yesterday. In autumn a government white paper -- similar to the 
EU white paper -- is to be presented. Its contents: economic 
and structural policy activities so as to contribute Austria's 
ideas "at the touch of a button" already at the state of 
discussions in the EU. 
<H5>  Against Unemployment </H5>
  For the time being, these are just declarations of intent. 
Ederer cited the following key concerns after joining the EU: 
strengthening European employment policy, including a more 
intensive struggle against unemployment; efforts to raise 
environmental standards in the EU; final negotiations on the 
EU's regional subsidies; a "peace policy" in the form of social 
and economic policy integration; use of Austria's experiences as 
an intermediary for East Europe. Ederer's motto for Austria's 
role in the EU: "Small but important." 
<H5>  Air Traffic Control in Vienna? </H5>
  Klima announced further specific activities. One of the main 
concerns refers to air traffic: Vienna would like to get 
superivision of air traffic control for southeastern Europe. 
  Klima is also trying to further develop Austria as an 
international business location. Agreements, which have already 
been concluded with individual countries, are being transformed 
into "Euroagreements." Regarding subsidies, the main focus will 
be on technology and innovation.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Excerpt] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Russia takes a 
major step toward integration with Western Europe here Friday 
[24 June] when President Boris Yeltsin signs an historic 
partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union 
[EU]. 
  The signing ceremony opens a two-day EU summit at which the 
12-nation bloc will also formally sign up new members Austria, 
Finland, Norway and Sweden -- its first enlargement since Spain 
and Portugal entered in 1986. 
  Speaking on his arrival at this Mediterranean island on 
Thursday, Yeltsin thanked the EU for leading the way in "ending 
the discrimination" traditionally accorded to Russia. He said 
Moscow and Brussels were becoming "equal partners." 
  The agreement will greatly increase Russian trade access to 
the EU, open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free trade zone 
after 1998 and provide for wide-ranging political dialogue. 
  It is the latest in a flurry of initiatives to bolster 
reform 
in Russia by binding it more closely to western political, 
economic and military institutions. 
  Two weeks ago Russia signed a cooperation agreement with the 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  On Wednesday it joined the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation's partnership for peace programme of military 
cooperation with the countries of the former Soviet bloc. 
  And next month Yeltsin will join in political consultations 
of the G-7 group of industrialised nations -- the United States, 
Japan, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- at a summit 
in Naples, Italy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mirella Kalostipi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Many senior officials arrived in Corfu today. 
All European Union [EU] leaders are expected to arrive on the 
island by late tonight. French President Francois Mitterrand 
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are expected late tonight. 
  Tonight, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will host an 
official dinner for the twelve EU leaders, the four new 
partners, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Russian president arrived in Corfu at noon today 
accompanied by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin 
and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Cypriot President 
Glavkos Kliridhis arrived earlier. Spanish Prime Minister 
Felipe Marquez Gonzalez's plane landed in Ioannis Kapodhistrias 
airport around 1400 today. [passage omitted] 
  Kliridhis said the differences with the Turkish Cypriot side 
have essentially increased and said he hopes that negotiations 
on Cyprus' accession to the EU will begin soon. 
  In a statement, Churkin referred particularly to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said: We will give all sides a last 
chance to reach a peace agreement. If they do not accept these 
proposals, which are extremely detailed and serious, I am afraid 
they will get into serious trouble. The Russian deputy foreign 
minister feels that the parties involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have no political will to reach a peace settlement. In any 
case, an effort will be made in Corfu and a last chance will be 
given to everyone for a peaceful settlement of the Bosnian issue. 
  Churkin described the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina as 
very 
dangerous. He said: What the ministers and the international 
community will attempt to formulate in Corfu and in early July 
is a serious proposal that contains strong elements to motivate 
and to dissuade the three parties.

<F P=106> [Statement by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at the signing </F>
ceremony of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
in Ayios Yeoryios Church, Corfu--live in Russian with 
simultaneous translation into Greek] 
  [Text] We have just signed an agreement of historic 
importance. I believe that in this way we have made a 
significant step toward progress in the unity of the European 
continent. This agreement precisely and completely states the 
conditions for Russia's economic return to Europe. It also 
determines Russia's role as an equal partner. [Words 
indistinct] the conflict ended some years ago. Now we have a 
warm climate in international relations, one that guarantees 
pluralism. 
  But the consequences of the Cold War still poison the 
atmosphere. I think we have all felt the threat of a new clash. 
In the former Soviet Union and Cocom [Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls] we have agreements that failed 
with regard to the smooth exchange of products. Now our 
businesses are trying to find new openings in the international 
market. Consequently there are new agreements regarding the 
exchange of goods, trade, and services. 
  We all know that there are local clashes, local interests, 
and regional clashes. These are serious symptoms that show the 
possibility of a return to the Cold War, but one that is 
financial in nature this time. With this agreement today, we 
can truly say that this threat is lifted. The European Union 
will now have new relations with the Russian Federation. The EU 
and Russia have made a strategic choice regarding Russia's new 
position on the international scene. Today Russia becomes one 
of the most important partners for Europe and the wider 
international community. In this way we will continue our 
cooperation and upgrade our relations for the benefit of the 
whole world. 
  I believe that on the eve of the 21st century this is indeed 
a historic event. We are moving toward tightening relations 
among people who have been artificially divided into two camps 
based on ideology. We are all witness to this new direction. 
We should recognize that there are many obstacles and that much 
effort and wisdom is needed by all sides--probably more than we 
thought at first. Under these conditions I believe that Europe 
is called upon to give an important lesson in real and authentic 
cooperation to the world in every sector, including the economy, 
ecological problems, the handling of conflicts, and cultural 
issues. Russia has vital interests when it comes to the West 
and Central and East Europe. We have every reason to support 
the institutions that deal with these problems. We know the 
problems in the former Yugoslavia. The EU, indeed every 
European country, can have faith in Russia regarding this issue. 
We hope for sharing within the CSCE framework, mainly to 
safeguard stability in the East of the European continent. 
  Russia is interested in the EU's economic and political 
development. We support the process of European integration and 
the expansion of the EU's institutions. We believe that soon 
there will be additional results and we will do everything we 
can so that today's small Europe will become a big Europe. We 
are also interested in European integration within the framework 
of our participation in the CIS. We have seen various tragic 
events lately. Everyone is required to make efforts to realize 
a unified Europe so that the 21st century will be the first 
century of peace throughout Europe. This is the direction we 
should follow because it is to everyone's benefit. 
  I consider that our common effort is already producing 
tangible results. The agreement we have just signed constitutes 
testimony and proof that we are following this direction and 
accepting the results. It is the first tangible step toward 
successfully realizing the goals. It took two years to conclude 
this agreement. There were many difficulties. Russia's economic 
and political reforms have not always been understandable; 
perhaps there were psychological difficulties on every side. 
  But we reached an agreement, and I believe that this 
agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation [which was] 
signed today has taken the most appropriate form. It opens a 
new chapter in relations, improving their quality. We have a 
credible mechanism for a permanent political dialogue and have 
strong foundations to continue working in the scientific, 
economic, technical, and cultural sectors. Russian companies 
will no longer need to fight an unequal battle in Europe; I 
think that this agreement provides a more civilized mechanism 
allowing activities by both sides. There is a clear possibility 
of gradual progress. We hope that in this way we will have 
greater opportunities to enter the West European markets and 
conclude the free movement of goods and capital. An appropriate 
framework for businesses will also be established in Russia. Of 
course it will be difficult, beginning, as we should, 
simultaneously in many fields. Already the agreement is raising 
issues. We have seen the texts that make up the agreement; they 
indicate the depth and detail behind the agreement. 
  We are here at the signing in Ayios Yeoryios Church. Do you 
know that the Orthodox call Ayios Yeoryios victorious? I hope 
this will be a happy coincidence. Let us consider Ayios 
Yeoryios as our patron. Opportunity has brought us here so let 
the last signs of mutual distrust disappear and let us begin a 
new, great project for our peoples. With this opportunity, I 
want to thank the heads of the EU member countries, especially 
the Greek Presidency and the EU Commission, for their great 
efforts and for the preparation of this agreement, which is very 
important and opens up new directions. The most important thing 
now is to implement this agreement. I should say that Russia 
will make every effort to achieve progress. We want this 
cooperation to proceed. I thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, in </F>
his capacity as president of the European Union, EU, at the 
signing ceremony of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
between the EU and Russia in Ayios Yeoryios Church, Corfu--live] 
  [Text] Presidents, Ministers, Ladies, and Gentlemen. 
President Yeltsin, with the political statement signed in 
Brussels on 9 December 1993, the EU [European Union] and Russia 
agreed on the principles and directives on which the partnership 
and cooperation agreement should be based. I am particularly 
happy because one of the important EU actions under the Greek 
Presidency is the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation 
Agreement with your country. Today's ceremony clearly shows the 
great importance the EU attaches to its relations with Russia. 
It confirms the EU's continued support for Russia's democratic 
development and reflects the great value for the EU of Russia's 
constructive participation in international and regional 
affairs, always in accordance with the principles of the United 
Nations and CSCE, which we have both signed. We know of 
Russia's interest in accession to the international and European 
organizations and welcome recent developments. The agreement we 
will sign constitutes the base for our cooperation across a 
broad spectrum of issues. The agreement provides the legal 
framework and reinforces the political dialogue between the EU 
and Russia. We sincerely hope that it will lead to mutual 
understanding and fruitful political cooperation that will 
contribute to the stability and security of all Europe. The 
agreement should give a big boost to our economic relations. It 
considers the intricacies of the economic, fiscal, and 
structural processes in Russia. It provides our economic bodies 
with the necessary framework and the guarantees to move forward. 
Ultimately, the agreement includes the possibility of expanding 
into a free trade zone. This agreement will also contribute to 
the success of our common goal, which aims at consolidating a 
new and democratic Europe and political and economic progress in 
our continent. I am convinced that our new partnership will 
contribute to safeguarding the peace and prosperity that our 
people desire so much. I thank you.

Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos snubbed Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi on his arrival for the signing of the 
Russian partnership agreement on the sidelines of the European 
Union summit here Friday [24 June]. 
  Pangalos descended the steps of the Ayios Yeoryios church 
here to welcome the leaders of the European Union members, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of the four 
applicant members, but stayed steadfastly in place as the 
Italian leader arrived. 
  Berlusconi's inclusion of five neofascist ministers in his 
government has caused consternation in many European capitals. 
Greece, ruled by the socialists, has expressed particular 
concern. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by European Parliament President Egon Klepsch at the </F>
EU summit in Corfu -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a special honor for me 
as the president of the European Parliament [EP] to pay tribute 
from this rostrum to the signing of the documents by which 
Norway, Austria, Finland, and Sweden become European Union [EU] 
members. 
  The signing of the acts of accession within the framework of 
this meeting of heads of state and chiefs of government has 
become possible owing to the overwhelming vote of consent by the 
European Parliament on 4 May 1994. At that time, I assessed the 
favorable vote in our parliament as a decision of historic 
consequence, and I cordially welcomed the future members in the 
European Union. 
  I would like to corroborate this today. You are cordially 
welcome. Your membership will strengthen parliamentary 
democracy in Europe. The social and democratic model in your 
countries, your political culture, your commitment to 
unambiguous and openness in policy -- these are the virtues for 
which the European Parliament showed its respect by voting for 
the accession of the four candidates on 4 May. 
  Is it not a unique event in the history of the European 
Union 
and its previous enlargements that the countries that now join 
us will be granted transition periods, while the European Union 
binds itself to raise the standards of environmental directives 
to the standards of the new members within four years? 
  For the European Parliament, the debate on the enlargement 
shortly before the end of the legislative period was probably 
the most difficult decision of the past five years. All 
deputies were aware of the great political consequence involved. 
The delays in the negotiation schedule and the resultant 
pressure of time were not caused by the European Parliament. 
  All the more, we must thank the Greek Presidency, which is 
hosting the meeting today, for having made a huge effort to 
bring about and ensure the completion of the necessary 
documents. It has thereby allowed the European Parliament to 
discuss the issue in a matter-of-fact debate. Through this 
debate, the broad public has become aware that this parliament 
of the European Union has decisive rights and powers and is able 
to deal with them in a responsible way. 
  Our parliament has often demonstrated this by its right of 
co-decision on legislative and budgetary problems, even though 
it may have done so in a less spectacular and 
publicity-effective way. 
  The European Parliament did not find it easy to make a 
decision on the enlargement. The reasons are known and are not 
attributable to the new members. The European Parliament was 
and is of the opinion that the inner institutional reform of the 
European Union should not have been considered of lesser 
importance than the enlargement. We have always insisted that 
the review of EU institutions, which is necessary for the 
functioning of the Community, should take place simultaneously 
and in parallel with the membership negotiations. This 
criticism applies to our own governments and the EU Council of 
Ministers. 
  Yet, we did give our approval, because we rely on the pledge 
made by the chiefs of government, saying that the European 
Parliament would be involved, on the basis of absolute equality, 
in the work of the preparatory group for the government 
conference in 1996, and because we believe that the contribution 
of the new member states will be in the sense of strengthening 
the democratic structures within the European Union. 
  With the enlargement of the Union by Norway, Austria, 
Finland, and Sweden, the geography of the European Union will 
change. The EU area will grow by 50 percent and will extend 
beyond the polar circle. For the first time, the European Union 
will also have a common border with Russia. This fact alone 
symbolizes new tasks for the enlarged Union. In this 
connection, I consider it a particularly good sign that the 
European Union has also signed the partnership agreement with 
Russia today in parallel with the membership acts. 
  However, the European Union is also facing huge internal 
tasks. We can only cope with the crisis of growth and employment 
by common effort. A prerequisite for this is a large and strong 
European Union whose members are oriented on the common basic 
values and convictions of the founding fathers, and which as a 
whole is able to win its citizens' confidence anew time and 
again. 
  The fourth direct elections of the European Parliament have 
shown how necessary this will also be in the future. The 
favorable vote for membership in Austria shows how people can be 
won over for this project through comprehensive information. 
The newly elected European Parliament will be a reliable 
partner on this road -- as of 1995, also with the deputies from 
the new member states. 
  The European Parliament will continue to be the democratic 
conscience of the European Union and, soon, the advocate of 370 
million citizens who expect this European Union to ensure peace 
and freedom, prosperity and health, employment and social 
justice.

<F P=106> [Speech by Austrian President Thomas Klestil at the EU </F>
summit in Corfu -- live] 
  [Text] President of the European Council, President of the 
European Commission, President of the European Parliament, 
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  On 12 June, the citizens of the Republic of Austria voted in 
favor of participating in the process of European unification 
with a convincing yes that is unprecedented in the history of 
the European Union [EU]. With this vote, they set an impressive 
signal -- a signal that shows that they believe in the European 
idea, a signal of confidence in the European Union that has 
become the central stability anchor of this continent, and a 
signal of determination that they want to participate actively 
and with commitment in the European peace work and Europe's new 
orientation. With great pleasure and encouraged by this clear 
plebiscite, the Austrian delegation has just signed the 
accession treaty. 
  We have come a good way. Numerous friends throughout Europe 
have accompanied us on our path and have supported us. I would 
like to convey cordial thanks to all of them at this festive 
ceremony -- for their understanding, their assistance, and the 
conviction of so many Europeans that European unification is 
ultimately not possible without Austria. Without being 
presumptuous, Austria considers itself the central country in a 
larger Europe -- a country that can look back on a century-old 
tradition of actively shaping European policies. Its historical 
experience has led to a deep skepticism of nationalism, hatred, 
and intolerance, but also to a special openness for larger 
European structures. It is a country that has for decades 
belonged to the family of highly developed West European 
democracies because of its stability and efficiency. On this 
foundation, Austria has developed an extensive social network 
and high environmental standards. One of the goals of our 
participation in the European Union will be to make these 
achievements a yardstick for the whole of Europe. However, our 
experiences have also taught us a lesson about the obligations 
of democracy -- that its institutions must be made even more 
unambiguous and that they must be brought closer to the citizens. 
  The European Union has repeatedly proven its willingness for 
further development and its ability for change in an impressive 
manner. We Austrians hope that we will be able to make an 
all-European contribution with our support for federalism and 
subsidiarity. 
  Austria is also a country of bridges and crossings. This 
leads to a special understanding for the colorful variety of the 
cultures and traditions and a close relationship with the young 
democracies in our neighborhood. After decades of dictatorship, 
it is finally possible for them to share the values of freedom 
and democracy with us. They are eagerly waiting for their 
participation in the process of integration. I am convinced 
that Austria is the ideal location from where the European Union 
can continue its future all-European efforts. Integration and 
solidarity are the most effective foundations of this large 
peace work. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, more than all other European 
countries, 
the Republic of Austria saw the historic changes in Europe at 
close range. Its citizens know their security will continue to 
be indivisibly linked in the future with Europe's security. 
They are strongly interested in the development of an 
all-European system. Thus, we are looking forward to our 
participation in the European Union with great pleasure and 
confidence. We have prepared ourselves well for membership and 
are determined to take part in Europe's restructuring and 
unification to the best of our ability. May we all be granted 
luck and happiness.

  [Text] The developments on the Cyprus issue and Cyprus' 
accession to the European Union [EU] tonight focus on Corfu, 
where President Glavkos Kliridhis will hold decisive meetings. 
Kliridhis will meet Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at 
1945 and European Commission President Jacques Delors around 
2030 today. 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in Corfu 
reports that the Greek presidency and the Cypriot Government are 
convinced that tonight's meeting between Papandreou, Delors, and 
Kliridhis will mark a step forward in comparison with the 
previous EU decision to review Cyprus' membership application in 
January 1995. 
  Well-informed sources have told our correspondent that 
Athens 
and Nicosia have set three goals for the Corfu summit. First, 
to specify that official talks on Cyprus' accession to the EU 
will begin in January. Second, if the first goal is not 
achieved, to secure a commitment that the timetable for the 
beginning of accession negotiations will definitely be set next 
January. Third, to see that the EU summit's closing statement 
mentions specifically that the next EU expansion will include 
Cyprus and Malta. 
  Kliridhis will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
at 
2330 today. Hurd went to Corfu following his talks on the 
Cyprus issue in New York with the UN secretary general and with 
U.S. officials in Washington. Tonight's meetings come after the 
Cyprus visit by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative for Cyprus.

<F P=106> [By Geoff Meade in Corfu, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major arrived at the Corfu 
Summit tonight refusing to back down in the growing battle over 
who replaces Commission President Jacques Delors. 
  And he hinted that he would be prepared to postpone a 
decision if it avoided putting a candidate unacceptable to 
Britain into the Brussels driving seat. 
  "I think it is important to get the right result -- whether 
that will be here or not I am not sure. Everyone would hope 
so," said the Prime Minister, after flying in for dinner with 
the other EU [European Union] leaders, Russian president Boris 
Yeltsin and the government leaders of Austria, Norway, Finland 
and Sweden, whose countries are due to join the Union next year. 
  Mr. Major gave little away about the hand he will play at 
the 
negotiating table in Corfu tomorrow night. That is when the 
real argument begins over the choice of the new Commission 
president. 
  Mr. Major was asked what was so wrong with Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose candidacy has upset Tory Euro 
sceptics. 
  "I think we had better wait and see what happens in the 
discussion. I have nothing to say about that until we have had 
it." 
  The Prime Minister may even veto Mr. Dehaene's chances in 
what must be a unanimous decision by the 12 leaders. If he did 
so, he would be embroiled in a major row with France and Germany 
who have championed the Belgian's cause. 
  His chief rival for the job, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers, has refused to withdraw despite the fact that Mr. 
Dehaene already has the support of about half a dozen member 
states.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Lubbers Withdraws'"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels/Bonn -- During yesterday's European 
Peoples' Party (EPP) summit in Brussels, Prime Minister Lubbers 
is said to have agreed to withdraw his candidacy for the 
presidency of the European Commission tomorrow evening. 
  German participants at the EPP summit consultation say that 
Lubbers does not want to risk a tough confrontation at the Corfu 
summit since he does not stand a chance against Belgian Prime 
Minister Dehaene. 
  The EPP summit agreed that as soon as a substantial majority 
is reached in favor of one of the candidates at the European 
Union summit, the one who looks likely to lose will withdraw. 
  In this way a consensus can be reached on who should succeed 
Frenchman Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. 
  The EPP did not agree to promote any Community 
Christian-Democratic candidates. Before the meeting began, 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called on Lubbers and Dehaene to 
embrace "so show that we are all friends."

  [Text] On the Greek island of Corfu today, the heads of 
state of the 12 EU member countries will look for Jacques 
Delors's successor. There are three candidates, and one of them 
is the favorite: Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who is 
supported by Germany and France. 
  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez supports Dutch Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers, a Christian Democrat: 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] We have already expressed our 
opinion. We think that all the candidates are very good. If 
we have to prefer one over the other, however, I have promised 
to support one Lubbers. I think, however, that Dehaene would do 
the job perfectly well, and I also told Brittan that we do not 
hold any grudge against him either. [end recording].

<F P=106> [Interview with Central Bank Council member Reimut </F>
Jochimsen, by Lorenz Wolf-Doettinchem; place and date not given: 
"`Blurred and Elastic'"] 
  [Text] [Wolf-Doettinchem] Mr. Jochimsen, the money supply 
is getting away from the Bundesbank. Can the German concept 
still serve as a model for European currency? 
  [Jochimsen] Double-digit growth rates are very irritating, I 
admit. I was never a money-supply manipulator, yet the fact that 
there is a long-term relationship among the money supply, 
production potential, and inflation has not, I believe, been 
disproved. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Your Central Bank colleague Hans-Juergen 
Koebnick considers German monetary policy to be without 
direction. 
  [Jochimsen] I consider the problem to be rather that the 
rule 
"too much money equals too much inflation" has been presented to 
the public in too simplistic a manner. It currently does not 
apply in any event--otherwise we would have had to raise 
interest rates as early as February. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Does not the Bundesbank's credibility 
suffer when it wants to stick to its concept but does not act 
accordingly in its practices? 
  [Jochimsen] We find ourselves in somewhat of a fix but there 
are no alternatives. I shudder at the thought of manipulating 
economic magnitudes such as price levels or the nominal national 
product. The instruments to do so are lacking. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Should Europe then also put its faith in 
controlling the money supply? 
  [Jochimsen] Yes, the European Monetary Institute should do 
all the preliminary work for that, but without turning itself 
into a quasi-central bank in the process. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] France always brings its pat solution for 
European monetary policy--a rapid monetary union--into play. 
  [Jochimsen] I can only warn against acting along the lines 
of 
"Courage! Let us show the markets how it is done." A precipitous 
monetary union would be an experiment with completely uncertain 
results. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] A common currency without a common state. 
Is that at all possible? 
  [Jochimsen] I have the greatest doubts on that score. It is 
one thing to create a monetary union; it is a different issue as 
to whether it will last. A glace at the history books will show 
that most monetary unions have failed. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Is this the fate in store for Europe as 
well? 
  [Jochimsen] The Maastricht Treaty is a makeshift 
construction. The necessary political safeguards for a monetary 
union--particularly in regard to economic and fiscal policy--are 
inadequate. The danger is real that a common currency will not 
result in a community of stability but in disintegration. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Can this danger be eliminated? 
  [Jochimsen] We need a Maastricht II that retroactively 
improves and supplements the treaty. The creation of a political 
union that is democratically legitimized and has a federal 
structure is particularly important. But the European Central 
Bank should be strengthened as well, for example by giving 
it--and not the Council of Ministers--responsibility for 
exchange-rate policy. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] Does not the continuing dispute over the 
interpretation of the accession criteria show that the entire 
Maastricht Treaty is formulated too sloppily? 
  [Jochimsen] Many provisions are blurred and elastic. In the 
revision of the treaty, the convergence criteria should be made 
more rigorous and the latitude for political interpretation 
should be narrowed. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] The trend, however, is rather to soften 
the requirements. 
  [Jochimsen] It concerns me very greatly that the criteria 
are 
being bent to suit one's desires. Negotiations are being 
conducted as though just any political compromise were at stake. 
One cannot, after all, just insert a paragraph here and there as 
in a normal law so that as many as possible can participate. 
Much more is at issue: money that amounts to something, a 
currency that lasts. One must not fool around with that. 
  [Wolf-Doettinchem] According to the Maastricht Treaty, the 
monetary union should begin in 1997 at the earliest and by 1999 
at the latest. Do you consider that to be realistic? 
  [Jochimsen] I regard fixing a calendar date for the debate 
to 
be unwise. The crises in the European Monetary System have made 
it more than abundantly clear to us: The convergence process in 
Europe has not yet progressed far enough. Many European 
politicians have not yet understood that the issue is not to 
make the mark, that torments them so much, into community 
property, but the issue is to create a European currency that 
possesses the same quality attributes. If there is any cheating 
in this regard, the markets will discover that very quickly. 
<H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5>
<H5>  The Overachiever </H5>
  Sixty-three-year-old Reimut Jochimsen can boast of having 
three simultaneous careers: as a scholar, a politician, and a 
central banker. The economist with a doctorate degree was a 
professor in Kiel, state secretary in the Federal Ministry for 
Education and Science, and was economics minister in North 
Rhine-Westphalia for 10 years. Since 1990, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] member has headed the North 
Rhine-Westphalia Land Central Bank. On the Bundesbank's Central 
Bank Council, the self-confident Jochimsen is included among the 
spokesmen. He is an advocate of European integration but also 
one of the severest critics of the Maastricht Treaty on the 
Economic and Monetary Union.

<F P=106> [Article by Lorenz Wolf-Doettinchem: "Bad Luck for </F>
Populists"] 
  [Text] "When we come, the mark will stay" is the proud 
message on Federation of Free Citizens posters. The party of 
Eurocritic Manfred Brunner, former cabinet chief for EU 
[European Union] Commissioner Martin Bangemann, wants to make 
the 12 June European Parliament election a "plebiscite on 
Maastricht." The Republikaner are following suit with their 
appeal to the voters to "help us save the German mark." Because 
the Maastricht opponents have the majority of citizens behind 
them, the Bonn politicians, out of fear of an election defeat, 
are offering almost nothing to counter the protest parties' 
polemics. According to opinion surveys, between 50 and 80 
percent of Germans--depending on the formulation of the 
question--reject monetary union. East Germans in particular do 
not want to give up the mark they acquired just three years ago. 
  For all that, the established parties could effortlessly 
ally 
the concerns of mark fans because the plan for a common currency 
is turning out to be more and more a distant illusion: 

  -  The 
timetable for monetary union, which according to the Maastricht 
Treaty is to begin in 1997 at the earliest and by 1999 at the 
latest, is much too ambitious. 
  -  Not a single EU country met the 
stringent accession criteria last year; proliferating government 
deficits in particular are becoming stumbling blocks to 
Euromoney. 
  -  The Federal Constitutional Court's ruling on 
Maastricht prohibits Germany from participating in a watering 
down of the convergence criteria--yet monetary union without 
German participation is hardly conceivable 
  -  In the coming years, 
the political will for European integration will be tested in an 
unprecedented election marathon in which nationalistic elements 
could gain the upper hand--as has already happened in Italy. 

  Moreover, the practical problems involved in introducing a 
common currency are proving to be treacherous as well. According 
to Bundesbank Foreign Minister Helmut Schieber, the "technical 
issues" involved with Euromoney are "more complicated than 
expected." And, to be sure, while the European Monetary 
Institute (EMI), which is supposed to prepare the introduction 
of a common currency, started on time at the beginning of the 
year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy had to start almost at 
ground zero because the Maastricht Treaty took effect nearly one 
year late as a result of the ratification marathon. According to 
central banker Schieber, the organizational work that really 
should have been taken care of in 1993 can only now be caught up 
on--"at the expense of substantive work." 
  Lamfalussy's little staff initially found shelter at the 
Bank 
for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel where the Committee 
of EC Central Bank Presidents had already taken up residence. 
The move to Frankfurt, the EMI's proper headquarters, continues 
to be delayed. After a summer date was initially envisioned, the 
first board meeting in the new domicile has now slipped to 15 
November. 
  At the present time, the top 10 floors of the 36-story 
former 
BfG [Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft] high-rise--today the 
"Eurotower"--are being refurbished to include an elegant 
conference floor at the top of the tower. To be sure, the EMI 
will certainly have to forego excessive luxury after the Eastern 
Europe Bank in London wound up in the headlines as a result of 
its excessive ostentatiousness and luxurious appointments. For 
the startup, therefore, old office furniture was even borrowed 
from the Bundesbank. Such unpretentiousness is entirely in 
keeping with EMI chief Lamfalussy's style and this is not the 
least of the reasons why the former BIS general manager was 
chosen in the autumn of last year. By foregoing interviews 
entirely, for example, the Belgian has accommodated Bundesbank 
President Hans Tietmeyer who jealously guards his prerogatives 
("The EMI is not a central bank"). To date, the EMI has 
published just a single report, and it deals with the rather 
peripheral topic of "prepaid credit cards." 
  It is thus understandable that doubts are now arising as to 
whether the EMI can become the "driving force" for the 
implementation of monetary union as French Minister of Economy 
Edmond Alphandery has called for. Thus far, EMI members have 
tackled their Herculean task in the manner of good bureaucrats. 
Experts of the 12 EU central banks are working on plans in three 
committees and five subcommittees and the deeper they delve into 
the problems, the more difficult the solutions seem. Example 
bank notes: The Bundesbank needed nearly six years to design and 
bring into circulation new paper money. Experience shows that a 
European process of coordinating safety features, the design, 
and the representation of national symbols, would certainly take 
even longer. Example coinage: With the striking of Eurotalers, 
all European coinage would be fully utilized for years. The 
vending machine industry needs exact specifications for the 
conversion to be provided expeditiously. Experts calculate a 
conversion period of six to eight years. Example statistics: 
Terms and definitions for banking and balance of payment systems 
have to be harmonized. A Bundesbank statistician complains that 
"entirely different concepts are still being used" in EU 
countries. The conversion of foreign trade statistics in the 
context of the European internal market has demonstrated how 
great the chaos can become. 
  Closely related to statistics issues is the EMI's greatest 
challenge: to devise a common monetary policy and to develop the 
appropriate instruments for it. To date it has been taken for 
granted that, after all the discussions have been concluded, the 
German money supply concept--in more or less modified 
form--would be adopted. Since the Bundesbank has apparently lost 
control of the M3 money supply, however, doubts are increasing 
as to whether Europe should pursue a money supply target at 
all--particularly in view of the fact that this indicator has 
failed in past years in the United States, Canada, and Great 
Britain. Wuerzburg Professor Peter Bofinger believes that "the 
Bundesbank's problem is becoming a European problem." 
  To introduce a new currency when monetary policy is flying 
blind could quickly result in a crash. Before there can be any 
progress in Europe, therefore, the Bundesbank must do its 
homework: Why has the growth in the money supply--apart from all 
special factors--been so immense in the last three years? Why 
have the monetary regulators nonetheless been able to reduce 
interest rates so sharply? Trier Professor Wolfgang Flic is 
calling upon the monetary regulators to "reveal their 
indicators," and monetary expert Bofinger--successor in the 
professorship occupied by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar 
Issing--complains: "The discussion regarding the proper monetary 
policy is not being conducted in Germany." 
  For all that, the success of the guardians of the mark is 
uncontested. Economics expert Wolfgang Franz, commenting on the 
most recent 2.9-percent inflation figure for western Germany, 
says "The Bundesbank has won the battle against inflation." 
Monetary expert Bofinger sees a real opportunity for EMI in an 
impartial investigation of the reasons for the currency 
guardians' success, but Tietmeyer, Issing, and Co. are not yet 
showing their cards. And EMI President Lamfalussy realistically 
assesses the work that lies ahead of him: "It will not be an 
easy task." Bad luck for populists--the mark does not yet have 
to be saved.

  [Excerpts] Berlin, 23 Jun -- The two-day meeting of the 
11th session of the joint Saudi-German Committee for Economic 
and Technical Cooperation opened in Berlin today. [passage 
omitted] 
  Afterward, Finance and National Economy Minister Muhammad 
al-'Ali Aba-al-Khayl delivered a speech expressing thanks for 
the reception and hospitality extended to the Saudi delegation. 
He also expressed delight at the participation of German 
Economic Affairs Minister Guenther Rexrodt in heading the German 
side at the session for the first time. [passage omitted] 
  Aba-al-Kyayl added that the series of agreements drafted 
during years of cooperation will be completed by the endorsement 
of the final draft of investment protection and encouragement 
agreement between Saudi Arabia and Germany during these 
meetings. 
  Aba-al-Khayl reviewed the economic prospects of Saudi 
Arabia. He said that Saudi overall economic growth rate for 
1993 was estimated at 1 percent and that the private sector was 
growing at a high rate reaching 5.1 percent compared to last 
year. Moreover, this growth rate had been achieved 
simultaneously with the stabilization of prices. He said the 
increase in the cost-of-living standard did not exceed 8 percent 
in comparison with the previous figure for 1992. Moreover, he 
said the volume of the kingdom's economy was 26th in the world, 
adding that the Saudi economy was also the largest in the Middle 
East region and that the kingdom occupied 20th place in the 
world vis-a-vis the volume of its trade. 
  He made clear that the kingdom had reduced government 
expenditures in the 1994 budget by 20 percent compared to last 
year in all sectors with no exception, pointing out that the new 
budget reflected the government's strong commitment to maintain 
the overall economic balance the kingdom enjoyed for many years. 
[passage omitted] 
  He said Germany was one of the kingdom's main trade partners 
and was fourth among countries exporting to the kingdom in 1992 
and 1993. He said during the last 10 years Germany had exported 
goods to the kingdom worth over 19 billion dollars. During the 
same period, Germany maintained a trade balance surplus with the 
kingdom that reached about $10 billion. He said German partners 
were undertaking implementation of 65 joint projects in the 
kingdom, with an overall capital of about 1.4 billion Saudi 
riyals, the equivalent of 600 million German marks, according to 
the current exchange rate. 
  His Excellency Aba-al-Khayl said that through the 
committee's 
joint efforts, two establishments have been set up to promote 
joint Saudi-German projects. These are Sageco, the Saudi-German 
Company for Development and Investment, and the Businessmen's 
Dialogue, a group of Saudi and German businessmen who hold 
meetings to discuss issues of common interest. 
  Minister Aba-al-Khayl said that the German-Saudi joint 
committee was facing the huge challenge of preserving the strong 
ties between the two countries and has served its individual 
interests positively during previous years, thus extending the 
framework of these ties. Therefore, every possible effort 
should be made to bolster relations between the two countries, 
Aba-al-Khayl said. [passage omitted] 
  The opening session was then concluded and the specialized 
committees started their meetings. These are the scientific and 
technical cooperation committee, the economic cooperation 
committee and the vocational training and cooperation committee. 
Meetings of the Businessmen's Dialogue also started between 
businessmen from the two countries.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah met in 
Bonn today with Helmut Schaefer, German minister of state for 
foreign affairs. 
  During the meeting, the brother foreign minister briefed the 
German minister on developments in the Yemeni Republic, 
stressing the Yemeni Government's eagerness to put an end to the 
fighting imposed by the secessionist elements when they departed 
from constitutional legitimacy and declared secession. He also 
informed him of the attempts made by the government of the 
Yemeni Republic before and after the situation exploded, as well 
as the recent efforts to bring about a cease-fire and the call 
to reactivate the Yemeni military committee, with the 
participation of Jordan, Oman, the United States, and France. 
  Basindwah further asserted that the secessionist elements 
have foiled all efforts and are working to escalate the 
situation and violate the cease-fire each time it is announced. 
  He added that the Yemeni Government is still pursuing 
efforts 
to find a solution within a Yemeni framework that preserves the 
national gains, primarily Yemeni unity, democracy, and 
constitutional legitimacy. 
  For his part, the German minister of state for foreign 
affairs asserted his government's concern about maintaining 
Yemeni unity, continuing our country's democratic approach, and 
working to cease fire in line with Security Council Resolution 
924. 
  The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd al-'Uthman, 
ambassador of our country to Germany.

  [Text] Berlin, June 23 (AFP) -- One of the main leaders of 
the South Korean student opposition is to meet North Korean 
leader Kim Il-song in Pyongyang and put proposals to him for 
detente and reunification, he said here Thursday [23 June]. 
  Choi Jong-nam, 26, who is also one of the main instigators 
of 
dialogue between North and South Korean students, told AFP he 
would meet with Kim within one week. 
  Civilian activists like Choi, who lives in exile here, have 
often served as intermediaries between the two Koreas in the 
past. 
  He said in an interview that the meeting, arranged two 
months 
ago, would go ahead despite recent progress in dialogue between 
the Koreas and prospects of a summit between the ideologically 
opposed states. 
  "We felt it was vital to pursue a civilian initiative," Choi 
said, "If discussions only take place at the level of 
governmentals, they will again be used by both sides to keep 
themselves in power." 
  He said he would propose that a federal structure be created 
so that both systems, (communist in the north and free-market in 
the south), could coexist after eventual reunification. 
  Choi said he believed "the negative experiences of Germany, 
Vietnam and Yemen show that reunification can only work in a 
federation." 
  He also called for an international conference grouping 
China, Japan, Russia, the United States and the Koreas to be 
convened to resolve the nuclear crisis in the peninsula. 
  An agriculture student, Choi was expelled from Seoul 
University for political activism. The South Korean student 
organization Hanchongnyon [South Korean Feceration of General 
Student Councils] sent him to Berlin last July to coordinate 
dialogue with North Korean students within the Pan-Korean 
Student Alliance for Peace and Reunification. 
  Students from both sides of the Korean divide have 
maintained 
contact in Berlin for years. During the communist era, North 
Korea was particularly well represented in former East Berlin 
within the framework of agreements with like-minded nations. 
  Choi said he was to travel to Pyongyang via Moscow and spend 
two weeks in North Korea. 
  Three South Korean students have visited the North in the 
past, despite a ban on such travel by Seoul and the threat of 
stiff prison sentences.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN): German consulate officials in 
Tehran have allegedly accepted bribes to issue visas, according 
to the ARD television magazine program "Panorama." According to 
the report broadcast on Thursday [23 June], genuine visas from 
the embassy are available on the street from middle men for 
prices ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 marks. Contrary to 
regulations, the applicant does not even have to go to the 
embassy to get the entry stamp. The corruptibility of embassy 
staff in Iran and in other countries was on the records of 
German courts and authorities, it was said. 
  A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that his 
department 
had no evidence of visa trading of this kind. If the television 
program had suggestions or evidence that proved the involvement 
of the German Embassy in this sort of dealing, then it was their 
duty to inform the Foreign Ministry to enable them to clear up 
the matter.

<F P=106> [Article by "eli": "70,000 Tonnes of Ammunition from the </F>
National People's Army in Other Hands"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- According to the latest calculations, the 
Federal Government has given away to other nations more than 
70,000 tonnes of ammunition, approximately 900 armored vehicles 
and artillery guns, 408,000 firearms, as well as other equipment 
and materiel from the stocks of the former GDR National People's 
Army [NVA] worth approximately 14 million German marks. 
According to the Defense and Finance Ministries, the stocks of 
wheeled vehicles considerably exceeds previous estimates. 
Nonetheless, they say that the arms were scrapped, given away, 
or disposed of faster than planned. According to the report, 
the Bundeswehr has been largely relieved of the task of 
stockpiling the military materiel. This work is carried out by 
two companies running approximately 60 depots. Roughly 850 
armored combat vehicles and artillery guns have been given away 
to NATO partners, other countries, or the United Nations. The 
report does not list the countries concerned; however, it is 
known that Turkey is one of the largest buyers of former NVA 
weapons. 
  More than 69,000 wheeled vehicles of the former NVA, above 
all cars and trucks, have been made use of, but the report does 
not say whether the vehicles were scrapped or supplied to other 
countries. However, a major number of vehicles are no longer 
technically usable and must therefore be scrapped. The people 
running the depots have counted more than 110,000 vehicles. 
  Of the huge ammunition mountain, 100,000 tonnes have been 
destroyed, and approximately 60,000 tonnes were given to other 
countries. Approximately 111,000 tonnes are still in the 
depots. Approximately 3,000 tonnes can be destroyed every month. 
In addition, so far, a total of 956 combat tanks, 2,074 armored 
combat vehicles, 814 artillery guns, and 140 fighter aircraft 
have been destroyed. Under the arms control law, an equal 
number of tanks and combat vehicles as well as 290 artillery 
guns will yet have to be removed.

  [Text] Bonn, 22 Jun -- Schaeuble, CDU/CSU [Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group 
chairman, described SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
Chairman Scharping's conference address as disappointing, 
because it lacked concepts and convincing proposals regarding 
solutions to problems. No statement was made on the SPD's goals 
and the speech did not say anything about possible coalitions. 
The question is no longer whether the SPD is tending toward a 
red-green coalition, but whether it will expand such an alliance 
into a popular front by including the PDS [Party of Democratic 
Socialism]. Scharping also failed to provide a clear answer on 
the party's attitude toward the PDS. Instead, the SPD just ran 
everything down: German unification, the economic upturn, and 
the government's foreign policy successes. 
  Scharping's government program contains promises that would 
cost 60 billion German marks to realize, but the candidate for 
chancellor does not mention where the money is to come from. 
Scharping failed to explain how he would combat unemployment 
and modernize the economy. Under him, the SPD has become a 
party that is out of step with reality and keeps its head in the 
sand with regard to the changed political situation in the world 
in a way that would lead Germany into international isolation. 
CSU Land Group Chairman Gloss talked of a desperate attempt on 
the part of Scharping to use emotions to create the impression 
of unity on the part of the SPD.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Will Scharping Push the Curve Up?"] </F>
  [Text] There months before the Bundestag elections, Rudolf 
Scharping's popularity has sunk dramatically. A survey 
performed by the Forsa Institute last week on a representative 
sample of 2,523 German citizens in the East and West revealed 
that only 26 percent of the population would vote for Scharping 
to be chancellor. On the other hand, 42 percent said they would 
vote for Helmut Kohl. 
  Thus, Scharping's popularity has taken a 180-degree turn 
since his election to the chairmanship of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] almost 12 months ago. Kohl lies ahead of 
his challenger in the popularity table both in the East and in 
the West, among the young and the old, and among all 
professional groups, including workers. Eighty-seven percent of 
Christian-Democratic Union [CDU] supporters would vote for Kohl, 
and 55 percent of SPD supporters would vote for Scharping. 
Thirty-one percent of the population, 8 percent more than last 
week, thinks that the CDU is the most capable of solving the 
country's problems. Only 11 percent think the SPD is the most 
capable of doing so, 3 percent less than last week. If the 
current voting forecasts survive until October, there need be no 
fear of a grand coalition: The CDU and Free Democratic Party 
could then continue to govern. 
  Within the SPD there is increasing doubt whether a turnabout 
can be achieved. The dispute over a red-green coalition is 
dividing the party. The appointment of a shadow cabinet 
centered on Scharping is expected to provide fresh vigor. 
However, the party leadership is beset with despondency and 
mistrust, brought on by a provoking interview with Scharping's 
rival, Gerhard Schroeder. 
  In an interview for DIE WOCHE, Hesse's environment minister 
Joschka Fischer, the leading man of the Greens, tries to rouse 
the SPD to battle against Kohl. He criticizes Schroeder thus: 
"I consider the things the quasicandidate is doing with the 
candidate distasteful."

<F P=106> [Article by ND: "PDS Wants To Compete With SPD and Alliance </F>
90/Greens"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The most important goal of the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the Bundestag elections on 16 
October and in the future parliament is the replacement of the 
Kohl government. Despite all the material differences and its 
criticism of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], PDS 
deputies would "in no event prevent" a change toward an SPD-led 
federal government. This was stressed on Tuesday [21 June] in a 
comprehensive election analysis by election campaign head Andre 
Brie, obtained by NEUES DEUTSCHLAND. 
  The party's main opponents will be right-wing extremist and 
rightist populist groups, Brie affirms. The PDS has "developed" 
its election campaign strategy "not from the viewpoint of 
conflict with the SPD, but proceeding exclusively from its own 
goals and strengths." The PDS competes with the SPD and the 
Alliance 90/Greens for the most consistent representation of the 
interests of the downtrodden of society and the east Germans, 
for the most far-reaching self-representation of the citizens, 
and for the most decisive steps toward a democratic, humanistic, 
and ecologically oriented society. "In contrast to voting for 
the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens," voting for the PDS "means 
not only voting for a change in government but for political 
change." 
  Brie assesses the results of the European and local 
elections 
of 12 June as a nationwide signal that the PDS is not "on its 
way out," but has political prospects as a socialist party that 
is critical of the system, is "unmistakably to the left of 
Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD," and will again enter the 
Bundestag with more than 5 percent or more than three direct 
mandates. While the PDS is still a zero-point-something party 
in western Germany, in the new laender and in East Berlin its 
prospects for local and land policy "have been secured for the 
foreseeable future. Only the PDS itself could destroy them." 
  Brie says that the PDS failure to get 5 percent in the 
European elections is due to the fact that in Brandenburg, where 
local elections were not held at the same time, the party was 
not able to sufficiently mobilize its potential voters.

  [Text] Hannover (DDP/ADN) -- Fifty-year-old politician 
Gerhard Schroeder has been reelected today by the Lower Saxony 
Landtag as minister-president. [Following the state elections 
in March] Schroeder received 83 votes from the 161 deputies. 
Seventy-six deputies voted against, one abstained, and one 
paper ballot was spoiled. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] has 
an absolute majority of one vote and will govern alone over the 
next four years. 
  Schroeder accepted the post amid the applause of his party 
colleagues. Christian Wulff and Andrea Hoops, the leaders of 
the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] and Greens groups, 
congratulated the head of government on his election. The 
minister-president announced the members of his cabinet to the 
deputies: Gerhard Glogowski would be interior minister, Peter 
Fischer, economics minister; Monika Griefahn, environment 
minister; Hinrich Swieter, finance minister; Rolf Wernstedt, 
culture minister; Walter Hiller, social minister; Christina 
Buehrmann, women's minister; Karl-Heinz Funke, agricultural 
minister; Heidi Alm-Merk, justice minister; (all SPD). 
Independent Helga Schuchardt became minister for science and 
culture. 
  The cabinet was confirmed in office in an open vote by the 
SPD majority. Schroeder planned to make a government statement 
this afternoon.

  [Excerpt] Hesse Interior Minister Guenther has 
unexpectedly announced his resignation. The 65 year-old Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politician gave cardiac 
disease as the reason for his decision. His doctors advised him 
to urgently abandon his original intention of remaining in 
office until the end of the present election period in Spring 
1995. Guenther, who comes from northern Hesse, was Hesse's 
justice minister between 1974 and 1987, and also interior 
minister of Hesse from 1982 to 1984. He was reappointed to this 
office in April 1991 after the SPD and Greens defeated the 
Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party coalition in 
the Landtag elections. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Mainz SAT-1 Television Network in 
German at 2005 GMT on 22 June carries a recorded 55-minute 
interview with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl entitled "Let's Get 
Down to Business, Chancellor." Guests in the SAT-1 studio in 
Mainz and people in the main square of Castrop-Rauxel in North 
Rhine-Westphalia, who are also participating live in the 
program, ask the chancellor questions. 
  In answer to a question from SAT-1 moderator Heinz Klaus 
Mertes about the current election campaign, Kohl says that he 
and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Scharping 
will compete with each other "for the best way for Germany's 
future." He hopes that this will be done in a reasonable form. 
The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not his problem, but 
a problem of the Social Democrats. The PDS is, for him, "the 
successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]." 
He has no sympathy with it. 
  Charts demonstrating the economic upswing and the parallel 
increase in Kohl's popularity are presented. Kohl does not 
accept that "politics and the chancellor are alone responsible 
for good and bad economic developments." "The economy in 
Germany -- this is all of us." In his opinion, "there is a 
great chance to make further progress" and to achieve more than 
a 1.5-percent increase in the GNP this year because exports are 
flourishing. However, "the improvement in the past few months 
has something to do with trade unions and employers." He pays 
tribute to the "wise and reasonable collective agreements." 
Many people have a share in the present upswing. 
  A shop steward from Teltow in the studio comments on 
increasing unemployment and poverty in his region. He doubts 
the economic upswing. Kohl says that "there is a tendency 
toward an upswing." Nobody said that "the upswing would take 
place everywhere in Germany at the same time." "There are also 
great differences in the new laender." He makes a point of 
stating that he "did not cause the breakdown" in the past. He 
knows, however, that "things do not happen quickly enough, but 
they are in progress." 
  In the main square of Castrop-Rauxel, people complain about 
unemployment. Kohl points out that "many new jobs have been 
created, for example in Dortmund." There is also a chance for 
medium-size enterprises in this region. 
  In answer to a question read by the moderator, Kohl says 
that 
he is not of the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl, president of the 
German Industrial and Trade Association, who called for further 
social cuts, despite the economic upswing. He rejects, however, 
social benefits "according to the pork-barrel principle" and 
calls for the elimination of abuse. Money should be given to 
those who really need it. 
  In the studio, a shop steward from Dresden raises the topic 
of part-time work. Kohl says that it would be an "illusion" to 
eliminate the problem of 4 million unemployed by part-time work, 
but many who are unemployed would like to do a part-time job. 
However, "nobody must be forced to do it." Part-time jobs 
might be transformed into full-time jobs later. It is better if 
apprentices who have concluded their training have a part-time 
job than none at all. "The main problem is that the economic 
recovery cannot immediately be translated into jobs." 
  A Bavarian director in the studio refers to a complaint from 
an east German, who is allegedly not paid by the Trust Agency 
and said that the chancellor did not keep his promises. Kohl 
said that he had promised "flourishing landscapes in four to 
five years." In many fields, they are currently developing. 
  Being confronted with a chart on the opinion of the 
adherents 
of the individual parties on the economic upswing, Kohl says 
that it is clear the SPD adherents have a more negative opinion 
on it. 
  Clips of participants in the SPD congress who ask Kohl 
questions are shown. He defends Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of 
the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
Bundestag Group, against criticism that he is against the 
emancipation of women. A lot has been done for sports in 
eastern Germany. He denies that the situation in Halle is bad. 
Unemployment has to be gradually reduced as quickly as 
possible. However, there will always be a basic stock of 
unemployed, which is cause for "concern in the future." 
  In answer to questions from people in Castrop-Rauxel, Kohl 
says that North Rhine-Westphalia, above all the Ruhr area, is 
the best location for Europe, which is growing together. The 
December summit of the European Union will be held in Essen, so 
that a landscape can be presented that has chances in the future. 
  Germany's debts must not increase further. "Enormous 
financial transfers" to the new laender are necessary. This 
year it will be 160 billion German marks, including private 
investment. But "this is solidarity with our neighbors, our 
compatriots." "We who have lived in western Germany for 40 
years" have to understand that "priority is now to be given to 
our compatriots in the new laender." 
  In response to questions from people in the studio, Kohl 
says 
that those who do something without being paid for it have to be 
especially respected. A "flourishing economy is needed because 
of jobs, but, at the same time, we have a profound moral 
commitment to their creation." 
  A man in Castrop-Rauxel says that the upswing can be 
perceived in the east, but not in the Ruhr area. Kohl asks him 
to compare the life of the people in the east with his own life. 
The people in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] also 
worked hard. He rejects prejudice and asks for solidarity. 
  In the studio, a young entrepreneur from Chemnitz complains 
about insufficient support from banks. Kohl is in favor of more 
help for young entrepreneurs. One should wait and see whether 
the investment allowance will really expire at the end of 1994. 
  Confronted with an Allensbach survey showing that a majority 
calls, above all, for tax cuts and a question from an EU 
official in the studio, Kohl agrees that "our tax burden is too 
great" and "the state quota is too high." However, money is 
needed for investments in the east. The stability of the German 
mark cannot be maintained with debts. "The stability of the 
currency must be my most important objective." 
  Asked by a circus director in the studio why there is no 
culture minister in Germany, Kohl says that there are culture 
ministers in the laender. He supports the decentralization of 
culture. 
  The moderator presents a survey showing that both east and 
west Germans give priority to leisure time over work. 
  The final question is asked by an employee in the studio who 
wants to know how peace in Europe can be ensured if the 
preconditions for it are not given in Germany. Kohl is sure 
that "we will be able to solve the problems arising regarding 
questions of internal security." However, several things have 
to be changed. He thinks that the quarrels about the law on 
combating crime are absurd. "We want a liberal rule-of-law 
state, not an authoritarian state and least of all a police 
state. However, a change in one's way of thinking is also 
required here." Kohl gives the example of the murder of a 
police officer by a Red Army Faction terrorist, who was also 
killed. For several days, the German public did not deal with 
the murdered officer, but with the terrorist. 
  Kohl points out that "foreigners are always welcome." 
"Xenophobia is always a disgrace for our country, but no 
foreigner has the right to block the exits and entries of 
superhighways because of political reasons in his homeland." 
Therefore, he does not understand discussions on the 
deportation of people who have broken the law. 
  He calls for a "new way of thinking in Europe in combating 
crime." "Most of our police do a good job." He "passionately 
called for the establishment of a European task force" when the 
Maastricht Treaty was concluded. The important thing for the 
citizen is that he gets help. "This is our joint objective."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ewald Stein: "The Security of Europe Is </F>
Indivisible"] 
  [Text] One can argue whether or not Russia's final entry 
into a partnership agreement with NATO deserves to be described 
as "historic," as U.S. Secretary of State Christopher described 
it. 
  But there is no doubt that both within NATO and in Moscow it 
has finally been recognized that there can be no lasting 
guarantees for European security unless all the parties 
responsible cooperate closely in implementing it. 
  Against this background, it does not matter what kinds of 
words and sentences have been used to set this partnership down 
on paper. What counts is a common desire, and this desire cannot 
be blotted out by political vanity on both sides. To this 
extent, the Partnership for Peace and the additional dialogue 
agreed upon with Moscow, which also calls for a mutual exchange 
of information on planned security-political decisions, must 
naturally be orchestrated as a whole. 
  Now it is necessary to explain this to certain East European 
countries which, for obvious reasons, have been skeptical and to 
some extent are still skeptical about having Moscow as a 
partner. Under no circumstances must these countries receive the 
impression that their membership in NATO is less important than 
Russia's. It is necessary in this regard to resolve all the 
present misunderstandings, for which NATO itself is not quite 
free of blame. At a early stage in the development of the 
Partnership for Peace concept, NATO should have explained more 
clearly to the East European countries that neither the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace can 
be viewed as a signpost pointing to the east. The point is not 
to create various different security zones in Europe, but a 
single one. 
  The fact that the specific interests of a major power must 
be 
considered in these agreements is a question of political 
reality. As a superpower, the United States has always played a 
special part in NATO, and NATO was able to live with that for 
better or for worse. Therefore, a similar part has to be 
offered to Russia, which is still by far the largest country in 
Europe. The fact that all Europeans can live with that was 
confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev at the signing of 
the agreement in Brussels. The Russian foreign and security 
policies will now have to measure themselves against this gauge. 
  It may sound naive to say this, but it is the great powers 
that have the final say on decisive matters. One can only 
undertake activity with them, not against them. The fact that 
the U.S. chief of diplomacy was the only NATO foreign minister 
to watch Kozyrev sign the agreement is a fact that speaks for 
itself. 
  This special role of the great powers also in the 
Partnership 
for Peace program will receive a positive confirmation if one 
looks beyond the narrow confines of Europe and is willing to 
assume extra responsibility. A political and military consensus 
regarding peaceforming or peacekeeping missions, or on the 
subject of such hot topics as North Korea, would be very helpful 
for the whole of society. The Partnership for Peace offers an 
opportunity for this.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Juergen Busche: "Scharping Wins -- His Party"] </F>
  [Text] It was not the style of his appearance, it was the 
style of a man who relieved many Social Democrats' minds of 
their doubts. At the congress of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] in Halle, Rudolf Scharping addressed individual 
delegates, not a firmly forged core of a political force 
vibrating in the expectation to enforce a decision. Those who 
had come to Halle with anxious hearts were cheered by the speech 
of the party chairman and chancellor candidate, who convinced 
them that it is a good thing to do party work for this 
politician and his goals. 
  It certainly also makes sense to try to form a "Federal 
Government without Helmut Kohl" in the fall, as Rudolf Scharping 
put it so very delicately. However, how to achieve this goal, 
was something the Rhineland-Palatinate minister-president was 
unable to illustrate in an inspiring way. The SPD is currently 
comparable to a car driver who is stuck a traffic jam. 
Scharping tells the party that it would not be in order to get 
out now and throw the ignition key away, but stresses that it is 
necessary to stay in the car and wait until one can go. 
  Go -- where? To more social justice. To an economic policy 
that safeguards jobs. To a wise environmental protection 
policy. For all these goals, the social democrats are in their 
party. But are they sitting at the feet of their political 
speakers to hear just that, especially at a time when important 
elections are upcoming? A culminating point of Scharping's 
speech was his eulogy for Johannes Rau. The party congress 
reacted spontaneously, with the delegates giving Johannes Rau a 
standing ovation. Johannes Rau undoubtedly deserves this, and 
everyone witnessing this moment in the desolate ice sports hall 
of the scrounged central German city was deeply impressed by the 
loving way in which the party leaders deal with each other and 
show their cordial gratitude. 
  However, Scharping thereby made the defeat that the party 
had 
suffered in the presidential election a topic at the party 
congress, and the message that the delegates heard said that the 
SPD would act the same way again. These were -- for a very 
brief moment only -- notes that would fit into a farewell 
address rather than a statement intended to challenge an 
opponent, and in the humorous address to his rival in the party, 
Lower Saxony Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder, he struck 
such notes, too. Would chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping 
have preferred to continue his speech in this way? 
  He had too much to say about current policy for that. His 
statement in this respect was credible and to the point and was 
the first official speech of someone who will be in government 
before long. However, this speaker failed to open the curtains 
to give a view of an unpleasant reality and a future that could 
fascinate everyone, no matter whether social democrat or not. 
This is the reverse side of the refusal -- which is basically 
right -- to make rash statements on future coalitions, including 
the discussions and speculations involved. The fight alone for 
one's own policy can only be successful if this policy is so 
convincing that everyone is eager to join it and acquire a 
strong image by representing it. However, there is little 
evidence that this is the case with the SPD. Nor will Rudolf 
Scharping's speech change much in this respect, even though it 
was at times marked by an effort to formulate his policy in a 
passionate way. 
  It was a speech to the party, it was a speech to the 
comrades 
-- it moved and touched them, and they were and are extremely 
grateful to their chairman for this speech. The delegates 
expressed this through the excellent result of the vote by which 
they officially nominated Scharping as SPD chancellor candidate. 
This result -- 95.4 percent, with no more than 14 votes 
against, in a secret ballot -- is really a triumph for the 
candidate. However, for him to win within the party is not 
enough. He must enthuse the public outside the party, and he 
must show people his vision of the future, as Willy Brandt was 
so excellently able to do. He did not achieve this with his 
speech at the party congress. He must manage to do so by 
election day. 
  If this had not been intended at the party congress in 
Halle, 
it would to a certain extent contradict the slogan -- We swear 
on our own flag. But perhaps the goal of this party congress of 
Halle was much more modest. Judging by the mood at the 
beginning, it could, for instance, have been: How do we get the 
party soldier out of the low of his involuntary role of single 
combatant? How can we explain to him that he forms an active 
part of a party that is able to demonstrate cohesion and is 
better than the party of its political opponent? 
  If this was Scharping's goal in Halle, the chancellor 
candidate may tell himself that this is what he achieved. It 
may not look like very much. However, if it is true that the 
optimism demonstrated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union is the only 
thing that can unreservedly be called an upswing, and if it is 
true that it was primarily this optimism that paralyzed the 
opposition, then Rudolf Scharping has achieved something at the 
party congress in Halle. Perhaps he could only achieve it in 
this circle.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Heinacher: "Where Are You Heading, </F>
SPD?"] 
  [Text] Despite the confusion of its chancellor candidate 
[Rudolf Scharping] on the subject of "better wage-earners" and 
his bitter reaction to Roman Herzog's election to the presidency 
and its poor performance at the European Parliament elections, 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has not given up. 
Nevertheless, the SPD, which a few weeks ago still seemed a 
sure winner of the Bundestag elections, is not in a good frame 
of mind. But Rudolf Scharping succeeded in getting a tighter 
hold of the reins in his passionate and militant speech at the 
SPD congress, in which he attacked the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], although his speech did 
not contain anything new. But the next few weeks will show 
whether his speech will enable him to take the rudder of the 
unwieldy SPD vessel and bring it back on course. 
  Scharping has obviously drawn conclusions from the internal 
party criticism of his election campaign style in recent weeks. 
He wants to proceed to the duel with Kohl with greater 
militancy. He wants to avoid bad moves and take greater care 
that his team plays a better game. He made it very clear in his 
speech that he is prepared to accept a red-green alliance. That 
is a clear blow to his opponents within the party, especially to 
the Lower Saxon Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder. Scharping 
knows he would lose potential voters in the political center if 
there were a go-ahead to a coalition with the Greens. But what 
choice does he have? A red-yellow-green coalition is out of the 
question now that the liberals have placed their support in the 
CDU/CSU. Therefore the only thing left to him is a grand 
coalition, which officially he refuses to hear of. But there 
are many indications that he will accept such a solution if the 
Bundestag election dictates it, in view of the challenge posed 
by German unity, the decreasing budget deficit, and the 
difficult labor market situation. Obviously, another question 
that concerns him is which of the two people's parties will 
perform better at the elections. 
  There is no doubt that the CDU/CSU is experiencing an upward 
turn right now. The chancellor is benefiting from the slow 
economic recovery, mainly in the east. Kohl's calculations seem 
to be proving right. However the road to the Bundestag 
elections is still long. Within the next few months, Scharping 
must demand more discipline from his comrades in arms; he made 
an initial call for this discipline in Halle. When he succeeds 
in guaranteeing order among his own ranks, his chances will 
increase again. Next Sunday's Landtag elections in Lower Saxony 
will provide the first indications of whether the population 
considers the "message" of Halle as an encouragement or as empty 
talk.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "E.F.": "All New Beginnings"] </F>
  [Text] It still needs to be seen whether the election 
congress in Halle will reverse the political mood in the 
country, which is unfavorable for the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] and whether it really means the beginning of a 
change in the atmosphere. To the extent to which party 
congresses and party congress speeches can influence such 
developments, however, Halle must be assessed as a success of 
the party and its chairman and candidate for the chancellor's 
office. The delegates were wildly determined to give the signal 
for a new beginning, which was expected by the party leadership, 
and Scharping not only did not make it difficult for them but, 
with his speech, he indeed created confidence and even 
enthusiasm. He demanded discipline and obedience, showed his 
critics their places with mild, fatherly strictness -- and the 
delegates thanked him for it. After all, they did not have any 
other choice if they did not want to damage their already ailing 
chairman even more. Four months before the elections, the party 
only has Scharping, and therefore it has to care for him. 
  Scharping did not deviate from his strategic line and from 
the concept of his election campaign: no statement on a future 
coalition, restraint regarding social promises, and 
concentration on the issue of work. He also remained loyal to 
himself in the noncommittal way in which he brushed over the 
tensions between ecology and economic growth and in the 
vagueness of the SPD's foreign policy line. However, more 
clearly than before, he was looking for a confrontation with the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union. Its 12 years 
of government have meant not only stagnation, but a step 
backward. And where the European Kohl is unsuitable as an enemy 
image, Scharping brings up Bundestag Group Chairman Schaeuble as 
the "man after Kohl" and describes him as a 
national-conservative reactionary with horns, a club-foot, 
surrounded by the stink of sulfur. The SPD, as the guardian of 
European enlightenment and the shield against the attack of a 
new, evil nationalism -- this idea became an inspiring common 
experience at the party congress, even if it does not have much 
to do with reality. 
  "Now things are getting started," the delegates chorused. 
The party's sinking into despondency seems to have stopped for 
the time being. The Social democrats are always great in making 
a new start. Things usually get difficult as soon as they have 
arrived.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A French Defense Ministry 
communique this evening stressed the humanitarian aim of the 
Rwandan operation -- to stop the massacre of civilians. [passage 
omitted] 
  The deployment of the forces for the operation is going 
ahead 
as planned, the Defense Ministry states. A rapid intervention 
military medical unit will soon be brought near the action zone. 
This evening, nearly 500 men are in place in the Zaire border 
zone, the communique adds. 
  Moreover, a first deployment of the Senegalese Army is 
preparing to join French forces. It is expected to arrive 
within 48 hours. 
  Two French Government envoys today met the president of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], which is opposed to French 
intervention. Yannick Gerard, assistant director of African and 
Malagasy affairs at the Foreign Ministry, and Jean-Michel 
Marlaud, the ambassador in Rwanda, were received in Mulindi, the 
rebel stronghold in northern Rwanda. The meeting lasted two 
hours. The aim was to explain to the RPF leadership the 
substance of the French international humanitarian intervention 
initiative, and to answer questions, a communique from the 
French Embassy in Rwanda said. We do not know how the RPF 
reacted.

  [Excerpts] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops in Zaire 
were poised Thursday [23 June] to move into Rwanda in the first 
stage of a two-pronged operation to help Tutsis at risk behind 
Hutu government and militia lines, senior military staff said. 
  The soldiers on Thursday would move into Rwanda's 
southwestern Cyangugu district to help some 8,000 Tutsis at 
three or four sites, the military sources said. 
  The French humanitarian mission to prevent further slaughter 
in Rwanda's ethnic bloodbath would also involve intervention on 
Friday or Saturday in the Gisenyi region of northwestern Rwanda, 
they said. 
  Gisenyi, north of Lake Kivu, is across the border from Goma, 
one of two Zairean towns with Bukavu, where up to 2,000 French 
troops will eventually be based for a UN-mandated, two-month 
humanitarian operation. [passage omitted] 
  General Raymond Germanos, operations chief in the general 
staff, said the mission will include a medical rapid 
intervention force of some 60 men, located between Bukavu and 
the Rwandan border. 
  The team would include medical, surgical and dental units, 
he 
said. 
  A military field hospital to care for Rwandan civilians will 
also be installed between Goma and the Rwandan border, he said. 
French medical staff will also cross into Rwanda with troops to 
assess needs. 
  French chief of general staff Admiral Jacques Lanxade stated 
that a total of up to 600 troops should muster in Goma and 
Bukavu Thursday. [passage omitted] 
  In Bangui, capital of the Central African Republic, some 
1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from Goma, French troops packed 
their kit and mechanics checked over light armour. An AFP 
correspondent at the French airbase, which has become a major 
operations centre, saw rows of lorries and other vehicles 
awaiting an airlift. 
  On Wednesday, three huge Russian cargo planes arrived 
carrying French Puma helicopters essential to the operation. 
  French air force Jaguar fighters flew from Bangui to 
Kisangani airport in northeastern Zaire to play a support role 
in Operation Turquoise, military sources said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the opinion of Valery Giscard d'Estaing 
[president of the French Democratic Union], the intervention 
operation in Rwanda poses problems, because it is the 
responsibility of Africa, not Europe, much less France. 
  The French forces of Operation Turquoise in Rwanda have thus 
entered the town of Cyangugu. They have established themselves 
in the Nyarushishi camp. This is where thousands of Tutsi 
civilians fleeing the massacres have taken refuge. No shots 
have been fired, and we have been well received by the people, 
Colonel Andre Chilles said this morning. 
  Two wide-bodied planes carrying more than 100 tonnes of 
medical supplies and equipment left Satolas [Lyon airport] for 
Rwanda this morning. Nicole Guillard reports from Lyon: 
  [Begin Guillard recording] At least 150 tonnes of supplies 
and equipment are going to be transported to Rwanda from 
Satolas. Half of the crates were loaded aboard a wide-bodied 
plane yesterday, and the second will leave late this afternoon. 
They are taking modular operating theater units, medical 
equipment, medicines, and vehicles supplied by Bron military 
college, within the framework of the rapid humanitarian 
intervention air force. This emergency force, incorporated into 
Operation Turquoise, should make possible the rapid 
establishment of two medical units in Zaire, behind the Rwandan 
border. A rapid intervention unit in southeast Rwanda will also 
make it possible to give first aid to the victims of the war, 
thanks to two medical units, a surgical unit, and a dental unit.

  [Excerpts] Paris, June 24 (AFP) -- French combat troops 
sent into Rwanda were on Friday [24 June] ordered to begin a 
reconnaissance mission along Lake Kivu in western Rwanda and 
towards the town of Gisenyi in the northwest, military sources 
here said. [passage omitted] 
  Light patrols were due to leave Cyangugu, the first camp set 
up by the French who arrived in Rwanda Thursday, bound 
northwards along Lake Kivu towards the town of Kibuye. The area 
is held by Rwandan government forces. 
  No details were given as to the numbers of men involved in 
this operation nor whether it had begun. 
  French troops based in the Zairean town of Goma, Operation 
Turquoise headquarters, are also due to cross the border Friday 
towards the town of Gisenyi, the sources said [passage omitted]. 
  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said later 
Friday that a centre would be set up next week in Goma to 
coordinate with non-government organisations which are assisting 
stricken Hutus and Tutsis. 
  The centre would "inform the mission command about the 
whereabouts of the people under threat and on the kind of 
humanitarian requirements," said spokesman Richard Duque. 
  France also planned to move relief supplies to the two 
staging areas set up by the French forces in Goma and Bukavu, he 
added. 
  But representatives of French humanitarian organisations 
hesitated on Friday to join the French initiative, saying they 
were torn between their desire to help the local population and 
by the fear of being compromised by a military operation.

  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France is hoping for "more 
active support" from the European Union for its intervention in 
Rwanda at the EU's two-day summit in Corfu starting on Friday 
[24 June], French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure 
said on Thursday. 
  "We need the support of the whole international community, 
we 
got it with the United Nations Security Council vote -- at the 
same time we expect much greater support from our European 
partners," Lamassoure said in an interview on France Inter radio. 
  Meanwhile Pierre Lellouche, foreign policy advisor to 
Gaullist presidential hopeful Jacques Chirac, criticised alleged 
lack of support from Germany for the Rwanda operation. 
  In a reference to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation 
to German troops to take part in the annual Bastille Day 
military parade next July 14, Lellouche said he would prefer 
"that the German units do a detour via Kigali to carry out this 
peace mission before parading in Paris." 
  For his part, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied 
that 
France was isolated over Rwanda. 
  Juppe told a press conference that Paris had won a pledge of 
"logistical support" from the United States and backing from its 
European partners and French-speaking African countries. 
  Juppe, speaking after briefing the Senate foreign affairs 
committee, said other countries might also offer logistical 
support and mentioned Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain. 
  The foreign minister, who played down Organisation of 
African 
Unity opposition to the Rwanda operation, also said there was no 
conflict with the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), 
which has vowed to fight the intervention. 
  "There is agreement to pursue dialogue. We shall maintain 
contact (with the RPF) during the operations," Juppe said, 
insisting that one of the objectives was to "save Tutsi lives in 
the western part of Rwanda." The Tutsi-dominated RPF mistrusts 
France for past backing of its Hutu rivals. 
  Juppe refused to answer questions on the progress of 
operations and to say whether French troops had entered Rwanda. 
  Lamassoure said that although there would be "technical 
support within the framework...of the EU," France wanted "other 
Europeans to take part in the military operation." 
  He said "There is a duty to come to the aid of a people in 
mortal danger" and "it is in this spirit that we are going 
there." 
  Lellouche, who was speaking on Radio Monte Carlo, said the 
"Europe as a whole will have to be reviewed" if Germany could 
not be counted on when "major political and strategic issues" 
came up. 
  He said that if Europe consisted of "the Germans looking 
after the Deutschmark, the British looking after trade while we 
are the mercenaries called upon to spend our money and have our 
young men killed for the stability of our periphery, then this 
Europe cannot work." 
  Lellouche added that the US had stabilised Latin America, 
the 
Japanese had contributed to political and economic stability in 
their region and "Europe's duty is to do this job in the south."

  [Excerpt] Alain Juppe does not accept that France is 
isolated in its action in Rwanda. For the foreign minister, the 
international community fully backs this humanitarian 
intervention. Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] The United States has given us its 
full political support. We have also received full political 
support at the United Nations and from a number of other 
countries that are particularly concerned by this operation, and 
also logistical support since the relevant ministries are 
currently considering the modalities of making use of U.S. 
logistic support for the operation. Our European partners have, 
without exception, let us know that they approved our 
initiative. Among the African countries, when we look at the 
declarations of various heads of state and government, the 
support from francophone African states is unanimous. There was 
much comment about so-called opposition from the OAU. I have in 
front of me an OAU declaration in English, which I will 
translate as best I can, it says following: The OAU fully 
understands and appreciates the international community's 
concern, including that of France, over the ongoing carnage in 
Rwanda; the OAU is concerned that the opposition of one of the 
parties might complicate the intervention. What does this mean? 
This means that there was no condemnation, just a consideration 
of the difficulties of this operation. 
  The main problem remains--relations with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]--which views this operation very 
negatively. We have obviously made contact with the leaders of 
the RPF in the last week. To describe what is happening as a 
kind of nondialogue, even aggression by France against the RPF, 
does not correspond to reality. I would be lying if I told you 
that the RPF supported us, but there is a dialogue. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Bihozagara, deputy prime </F>
minister-designate in the Rwandan transitional government, by 
announcer Bililian; with recorded remarks by Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe -- live] 
  [Text] [Bililian] Mr. Juppe, the minister of foreign 
affairs, spoke about France's relative isolation in operation 
Turquoise this morning. He considers that our isolation has 
been exaggerated, even if for the moment only Senegalese troops 
have been announced on the ground. The OAU is not as strongly 
opposed as is claimed, said Mr. Juppe, and as for the rebels of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] -- I am still quoting Mr. 
Juppe -- their hostility is not so radical. Mr. Juppe said: 
  [Begin recording] [Juppe] I myself received Mr. Bihozagara, 
the deputy prime minister designate in the transition government 
and one of the most important people in the political bureau of 
the RPF, here in Paris yesterday. He had a working session of 
nearly three hours. I myself spoke to him for more than an 
hour. Naturally, I did not remove his objections to the 
operation, but I would like to quote two things he said to me in 
the presence of some dozen people, who can bear witness. 
  First of all, he told me that in his view France is a 
trustworthy partner -- I quote -- for the RPF in the coming 
months and years. It is trustworthy because it was behind the 
Arusha process, which met the complete approval of the RPF. It 
is a trustworthy partner because the RPF knows that when Rwanda 
has to be reconstructed, France will have a full role to play. 
  The second thing Mr. Bihozagara said, which I want to quote 
word for word: He told me that France's initiative is a 
praiseworthy one, but that for reasons of principle connected to 
the past and to their ideas -- namely, UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda], yes; other intervention, no -- he could not 
give his approval. [end recording] 
  [Bililian] Mr. Bihozagara, you heard what Mr. Juppe just 
said. He referred to you as the deputy chairman of the 
transition government, which is supposed to be established in 
your country, Rwanda. Has your position toward France changed 
over the past few days? As Mr Juppe said: You were overtly 
hostile to this intervention, you talked about the French in 
terms of invaders, and you were opposed and even ready for your 
troops to fight the French if they met them. 
  [Bihozagara] I must say first of all that I was not alone 
in this (?mission). I was with the secretary-general of our 
organization. What Alain Juppe said is quite right. France 
will be a trustworthy partner, but not in the military domain. 
We need France for development projects, for the reconstruction 
of the country, and for other things, but in a clearly bilateral 
framework, where there is mutual respect. 
  [Bililian] So that means that initially nothing has changed. 
The operation, as you heard -- you heard the reports from our 
special correspondents as I did -- your position has not 
changed: You are opposed to French intervention, and there is a 
danger of clashes between the troops under you and the French, 
if they meet. 
  [Bihozagara] Yes, we are still very strongly opposed to the 
French military intervention. However, we have simply said that 
we support humanitarian initiatives in the framework of the 
agreements, first the Arusha agreement, but also UN Resolution 
918, which entrusted this mission to UNAMIR 2, which is to be 
made up of neutral countries. We consider that France is not 
neutral in this game. 
  France was in Rwanda for three years, and saw massacres 
happening and could not stop them. Why is it now intervening to 
stop the massacres? 
  [Bilalian] Nevertheless, France is intervening, first of 
all, 
as you heard, to save the Tutsi minority -- that is to say, your 
people -- who are facing difficulties under the control of the 
current government. You must be sensitive to that, and no one 
has really come forward to help you. Now France is saying: We 
will go, because everyone is sitting there, everyone is shocked, 
but no one is making up their minds to do anything. 
  [Bihozagara] First, I think that France is getting involved 
in a political game. Why save the Tutsi minority? They are not 
the only ones in danger from the crime. There are moderate 
Hutus, there is the opposition, there are Hutu intellectuals 
being targeted. I would like to make it clear that the groups 
in danger are not only Tutsis. 
  So, as for intervention now, first of all we say that it is 
late in coming, because the RPF has already committed itself to 
saving the people. We think that France, which is up to its 
neck in this policy, which armed the people who are doing the 
killing, and which gave them military training -- we think that 
it is going to form a (?corridor), a wall, to give a breathing 
space of last resort to those people, I mean to those fascists 
who are now on the run and (?are going to) Zaire. 
  [Bililian] So you think French intervention is really to 
give 
a respite to the government forces fighting you. Nevertheless, 
the neutral countries, your African brothers, and other African 
countries, are not intervening. 
  [Bihozagara] Yes. You know the OAU adopted a position 
against it. 
  [Bililian] Against it, yes, but it did not decide anything 
specific. So who should intervene, or should no one intervene 
in the end? Are you saying no one should intervene? 
  [Bihozagara] I am telling you that there are African troops, 
African countries, which have already made a positive response 
for intervention, but they do not have the means. 
  [Bililian] They were there and they did nothing at the start 
of the fighting last month. They were in Kigali. We saw them, 
because some of them even left. 
  [Bihozagara] But there weren't only African groups. You know 
that the UNAMIR force was a multilateral force also consisting 
of Africans and Europeans, notably Belgians. 
  So what we are surprised at is that when the Rwandan people 
needed international assistance, people packed their bags, and 
after 500,000 deaths they are now thinking about them. That 
really is cynical. 
  [Bililian] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Marie-Pierre Subtil: "Increasing Criticism </F>
Leveled at Planned French Intervention in Rwanda"] 
  [Excerpt] The planned French intervention in Rwanda is 
being subjected to increasing criticism, often severe, from 
Africa, Europe, and the United Nations, whose Security Council 
was still examining Paris's proposal on Tuesday, 22 June. In 
France itself, objections have been raised from within the 
government majority. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], speaking 
of "aggression," on Tuesday stated that it would oppose French 
troops "by all possible means." On the same day, the 
Organization for African Unity (OAU) refused to support the 
French initiative, which is also opposed by a number of 
humanitarian organizations. 
  In Rwanda, Africa, and Europe, the reactions to the French 
initiative are such that its very principle is now in doubt. 
Pierre Messmer declared angrily: "This operation is badly 
planned, ineffective, and dangerous." In the opinion of the 
former prime minister, an old hand in African affairs, "the 
chances of success are low and the risks are considerable." 
This opinion is shared by many in the French military, the 
partners initially sounded out by France -- who politely 
declined Paris's invitation -- and even the Africans. Events 
have taken such a turn that on Tuesday, 21 June, [Prime 
Minister] Edouard Balladur announced that the initial aims would 
be revised downward, and he placed five conditions on French 
troops being sent to the Rwandan border. In particular, there 
was no question of going into "the heart of Rwanda," nor of 
intervening without the support of contingents from other 
countries. However, Paris still is still not making the 
agreement of the RPF a precondition. 
  France is ready to intervene even though one of the two 
warring factions, the RPF, has assured that it will consider any 
French soldier to be its enemy. This is precisely the flaw in 
the operation. [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi 
pointed this out to Edouard Balladur in a telephone conversation 
on Tuesday, stating that his country was prepared to supply 400 
men (250 for the special forces and 150 for logistics), but only 
on condition that the United Nations gave the operation its 
go-ahead (the same condition that applies for France) and that 
the agreement of the belligerents was obtained. 
  Paris's initial idea was to supply some impetus to solving 
the crisis by triggering an international operation. 
  Now the operation being planned is practically unilateral. 
For the time being, with the exception of Senegal, none of the 
hoped-for partners has made a firm commitment to send in troops. 
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino on Tuesday confirmed 
that intervention by "one or two white countries would be viewed 
as an act of recolonization." The Italians are ready to 
participate in an international humanitarian operation, but not 
in "the action that the French would want to take, alone or with 
us." He added that this would constitute "a major factor for 
conflict." 
  Such reticence does not stop the French Foreign Ministry 
from 
believing that Italy or other countries will still participate. 
[passage omitted] The ministry does not believe that France is 
alone against the world, rushing into an operation that is 
destined to fail. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- Israeli Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yossi Beilin on Thursday [23 June] commended France for 
what he called its "courageous" decision to launch a 
humanitarian military intervention in Rwanda. 
  After a meeting here with French Minister Delegate for 
European Affairs Alain Lamassoure, Beilin added that he hoped 
that once Israel had sorted out its own regional problems, it 
could help other countries to deal with theirs. [passage omitted] 
  Beilin, on a working visit to Paris, also discussed with 
Lamassoure the renegotiation of a trade agreement between Israel 
and the European Union, which was first signed in 1975 and 
reviewed in the early 1980s, he said. They also talked about 
cooperation in scientific research. 
  Beilin was later due to meet Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
and 
President Francois Mitterrand's chief of presidential staff, 
Hubert Vedrine.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Another Fine Mess"] </F>
  [Text] It is an operation that has been denounced by the 
Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], that is to say, by the 
initial victims of the genocide it claims to be putting a stop 
to, as well as by most of the humanitarian organizations 
operating on the ground, and even by the churches. It is an 
initiative that has been criticized by the OAU and to which many 
of France's allies have given a muted reception. The least we 
can say is that, even in the event of the Security Council 
rubberstamping the operation, French intervention in Rwanda is 
turning into a fiasco before it has even begun. 
  The fact is that Paris was not, initially, the ideal 
candidate for such an intervention. As a former colonial power 
suspected of having moved its pawns at the expense of its 
Belgian competitor, even of defending this French-speaking 
outpost, and guilty of years of complicity with the former 
Kigali dictatorship, France has further aggravated its position 
by its attitude in recent months. 
  Why, in April, was France happy to selfishly repatriate its 
nationals and approve, together with everyone else, the 
withdrawal of the 2,000 blue helmets from Rwanda at the very 
time one of the worst massacres of this century was beginning in 
that country? Why was France so slow in coming round, 
coincidentally just as the RPF had won the upper hand on the 
ground? Not only does France stand accused of, once again, 
coming to the aid of the former power, but its initiative has 
had the effect of returning prestige to African regimes that are 
just as guilty, such as that of General Mobutu in Zaire. 
  It is nonetheless true that the "duty of humanitarian 
intervention" in which Paris has become expert is a quite 
legitimate and necessary notion and that what is termed, rather 
pompously, the "international community," has once again 
overwhelmingly failed in its mission. Some 18 months ago, the 
aforementioned community spectacularly came together, led by the 
United States, to act in the face of the famine in Somalia. 
  Somalia is still home to 18,000 blue helmets, whereas there 
are only 550 in Rwanda. Given the estimated 500,000 victims of 
the massacre, this amounts to one "peacekeeper" for every 1,000 
persons who have died. Since then, hasn't there has been a kind 
of a media saturation, tinged with a touch of racism ("let the 
Africans kill each other")? 
  A few days ago, UN diplomats were seriously discussing 
whether we should talk of "peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" in 
Rwanda, or if the term "genocide" was appropriate. It is 
possible that the five "conditions" laid down by Edouard 
Balladur will be the start of a return to order. However, the 
worse thing would be if the "international community" stopped 
there. It, too, is responsible for this mess.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Charles Lambroschini: "Rwanda, the French </F>
Example"] 
  [Excerpts] If France does not go to Rwanda, who will? It 
"invented" human rights, it is the only Western power which is 
still involved in Africa, it is the only one to have credible 
military resources. [passage omitted] 
  First, a legal reason was needed. Because, for states, which 
are cold monsters, indignation is not enough to justify a 
policy. Alain Juppe reaffirmed at the United Nations that the 
principles inherited from the victory over Hitler impose a duty 
of intervention against genocide. In proportion to the French 
population, 500,000 victims in Rwanda over the past two months 
would be the equivalent of almost 4 million dead in our country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Second, this intervention can only be international. On pain 
of being suspected of colonialist nostalgia, France cannot go in 
alone. Other European countries are needed and so far only Italy 
seems prepared to cooperate. Above all, Africans are needed: 
For the time being only Senegal has volunteered. 
  Paris is accused of flying to the aid of its former ally, 
the 
Hutu government, which is also mainly responsible for the 
massacres. But this is to forget that, since then, the French 
Government has changed, and so has its policy. It is also to 
disregard the fact that Francois Mitterrand, an active advocate 
of an intervention, is less anxious to counter the Tutsis of the 
RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel movement than to ease his 
conscience. 
  In reality, France is showing that, when it wishes, it can 
make the difference. With regard to GATT, the French were 
initially the only ones to reject the agricultural agreement 
concocted by the Brussels Commission and the United States. But 
[Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe finally 
persuaded and led their partners. Faced with the Twelve's united 
front, the Americans backed down. The scenario was the same in 
Bosnia: France played a decisive role in leading its allies, 
including the United States, in a firmer military attitude 
toward the Serbs and more realistic diplomatic statements about 
the Muslims. The result was a marked reduction in the intensity 
of the fighting on the ground. 
  France has a duty to take the initiative on Rwanda. Now that 
Africa is no longer an issue between the United States and 
Russia, it would certainly be easier to turn a blind eye. But, 
abstaining now is to run the risk of being condemned to launch 
tomorrow into an even more costly operation. Indeed, it is 
clear that, without an external intervention, the problem will 
solve itself...by eliminating some of the factors. The advanced 
countries would find it difficult to be satisfied with Cain's 
answer: "Am I my brother's keeper?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Roberto Maroni by Enrico </F>
Fierro and Giampaolo Tucci in Rome; date not given: "`I Have 
Put My Slippers On; The Viminale Is Safe in My Hands'"--first 
paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] All of a sudden, he starts talking about [Prime 
Minister] Berlusconi in the same way in which [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi usually refers to him. It happens almost 
immediately, five minutes into the interview, and it comes as a 
real surprise. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, the League's 
least typical exponent, grasps -- to use a well-worn metaphor -- 
the sword of Alberto da Giussano [medieval leader of original 
Lombard League] and says: "As far as I know, there will be no 
election. There is not a single reason for going back to the 
polls. Berlusconi, as we are well aware, is toying with the 
temptation; he wants to make the most of the wave of elation and 
govern by himself.... But Sunday [reference to 19 June League 
rally] made it more difficult for him to bring his plan off. 
Much more difficult." 
  [L'UNITA] More difficult? Why? 
  [Maroni] Because on Sunday, at Pontida, Bossi made things 
quite clear. He spoke of a legislative government, and that 
obviously puts Berlusconi on the spot. Indeed, the prime 
minister is trying to set himself up as the sole guardian of the 
principle of governability. Bossi has decided that this will 
continue no longer. The League wants to govern. No traps, no 
subterfuges: Bossi's speech was an unambiguous declaration of 
intent. 
  [L'UNITA] And the independentist soul? What do League 
members who see Berlusconi as [former Prime Minister] Bettino 
Craxi's old buddy have to say about it? 
  [Maroni] On Sunday, the League formally acknowledged its two 
tendencies, and for those of us who are in government, that 
takes a load off our minds. At the beginning, my job was a dual 
one: working with our government ally and, at the same time, 
keeping my eye on him. Not any more. Others will take over the 
monitoring role now. To put it plainly, we have shared the 
workload between us, between the two tendencies. 
  [L'UNITA] The two tendencies, sure. Are they not a figment 
of the imagination? The only way to avoid being absorbed, 
politically speaking, by Forza Italia? 
  [Maroni] They are not a political fantasy. The League's 
"proletarian" soul does exist, and it is a force to be reckoned 
with. It is a phenomenon that I noticed two years ago. Part of 
the League's grass roots criticized our entry into local 
government. It wanted to be in opposition: against the old 
system and in support of federalism. That is the source of the 
difficulties encountered by the administrations that we lead. 
There were some League city councilors, in Varese, who stopped 
calling me by my first name when I became a councilor with 
departmental responsibility. 
  [L'UNITA] Let us get back to Berlusconi. His plan can be 
easily summed up: new electoral laws, back to the polls, Forza 
Italia wipes the board, devouring the League and, to some 
extent, National Alliance. One gets the feeling that Berlusconi 
has his mind on the operation that [former Prime Minister] De 
Gasperi pulled off after the war: Dumping his more cumbersome 
allies and recycling the old governing classes. 
  [Maroni] You sound just like Bossi.... I believe that 
Berlusconi is toying with this idea, because he wants to govern 
on his own. Governing as such is more important to him than the 
mode of government. But, after the Pontida rally, it is not so 
easy for him to say that the majority is not united, the League 
is unreliable, and we must go back to the polls. Bossi has said 
in no uncertain terms that the guiding principle of 
governability is what guides us too. In this respect, we can 
even outshine the image of Forza Italia: It strikes me, indeed, 
that governability is its sole guiding principle, and we do not 
intend to hand over exclusive rights to that. That gives 
Berlusconi the jitters, of course. 
  [L'UNITA] On the subject of the electoral law. Berlusconi 
would like a one-round, uninominal system along British lines. 
Bossi does not seem to agree. What about you? 
  [Maroni] A single round. That is the League's official 
position, and has been for a long time now. We want to do away 
with the relics of proportional representation still surviving 
in the electoral system. 
  [L'UNITA] Do you not run the risk of extinction that way? 
  [Maroni] We would run the same risk with a two-round system. 
If we went to the polls today, how many of the League's 
candidates would get through to the second ballot? 
  [L'UNITA] Not many. 
  [Maroni] Quite. But apart from these considerations, be they 
selfish or matters of principle, I think that the government 
should have no say in the electoral rules. It is a matter for 
parliament. So neither the prime minister nor I.... 
  [L'UNITA] Point taken. In recent times, you seem to have 
been the League member most susceptible to Berlusconi's charms. 
The most malleable, in other words. 
  [Maroni] If we are talking about soccer, yes: I would like 
to play in the forthcoming cupwinners' cup final, at least for 
five minutes. But otherwise, no. My bond with Bossi is born of 
a longstanding friendship, not political calculation. If I 
continue in politics, it will be in the League. There are no 
alternatives for me. My political career began in the League 
and will end in the League. 
  [L'UNITA] When he was a deputy, Roberto Maroni had it in for 
the [Interior] Ministry, he depicted skeletons in the Viminale's 
[Interio Ministry] closets, he criticized [Police Chief] Parisi, 
the secret services, you name it.... But not any more. Quite 
the contrary: He praises Parisi and defends Salazar, the head 
of the secret service. Were you naive before or are you smart 
now? Is the Viminale swallowing you whole? 
  [Maroni] If the pair of you were appointed to the Fiat 
board, what would you do? Would you revolutionize the whole top 
management? Would you start shouting that they are all corrupt 
or accomplices to corruption? For Fiat it would mean paralysis, 
bankruptcy. I do not want to bring the Interior Ministry to a 
standstill, I do not want total paralysis. It is not in my 
interest to halt police action against the Mafia. That is what 
is behind my "soft" approach. I have given myself six month's 
breathing space. In those six months, I will try to understand 
the people and see how the offices work. For the time being 
there will be no changes, but in October or November there will 
be. I arrived here with a reputation for being a revolutionary: 
I have had to put my slippers on to prevent the structure 
falling apart. 
  [L'UNITA] Was it you who saved Salazar after the allegations 
of political espionage made by [former President] Cossiga? 
  [Maroni] I saved no one, because no one asked me for 
Salazar's head. 
  [L'UNITA] You have publicly praised the chief of police; 
[cabinet spokesman] Giuliano Ferrara has criticized him heavily. 
A government split on Parisi? 
  [Maroni] Ferrara demanded Parisi's head after the jail break 
by [crime boss] Felice Maniero. The chief of police had nothing 
whatsoever to do with it. On the contrary, he had issued a 
warning about the break. 
  [L'UNITA] Ferrara's demand did not seem to be dictated 
solely 
by Maniero's escape. His tone revealed a marked political 
dislike of the chief of police. 
  [Maroni] If that is the case, Ferrara played his hand badly, 
as he forced me to defend Parisi publicly, and now Parisi is in 
a stronger position than before. 
  [L'UNITA] Stronger or impregnable? 
  [Maroni] No one's position is impregnable, not even the 
minister's. We shall see in six months. I defend no one as a 
matter of course. I will cover nobody. 
  [L'UNITA] Let us talk about the Mafia. The majority is 
sending out ambiguous signals: daily attacks on the front-line 
magistrates, fierce criticism of the turncoats. To take two 
examples, Tiziana Maiolo, who chairs the Justice Committee at 
Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies], casting doubt on the 
measures prescribing special jail conditions for the bosses, and 
Berlusconi's lawyer, [Defense Minister] Cesare Previti, accusing 
[former Parliamentary Antimafia Committee chief] Violante, 
Public Prosecutor Caselli, and Provincial Police Chief De 
Gennaro, in an interview granted on 1 April, of hatching some 
sort of communist plot. 
  [Maroni] I should first like to make one thing clear: 
Nobody, inside or outside the government, can force me to do 
things against my will. If the line that I adopt in combating 
the Mafia were not endorsed, if it were contested, I would 
leave, I would resign. 
  [L'UNITA] We were talking about the many ugly signs.... 
  [Maroni] I would ask everyone -- members of the government, 
the majority, and the opposition parties -- to let this debate 
on jail conditions and Mafia turncoats drop. The rules on 
turncoats are off limits, and so are jail conditions for Mafia 
bosses. We are looking into ways of enhancing these measures, 
not watering them down. Be that as it may, certain discussions 
and statements by individuals must not be allowed to give the 
Mafia grounds for hope that the government intends to treat it 
kindly. That is why I call for greater caution on all sides. 
  [L'UNITA] Caution? Previti attacked no less a person than De 
Gennaro, head of the DIA [Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate], 
the body directly engaged in fighting the Mafia.... 
  [Maroni] I have met De Gennaro. He is a very capable man. 
It is true that he, too, has to cope with contradictions, but 
they are objective, physiological contradictions faced by the 
DIA due to the fact that it is a new structure. De Gennaro is 
doing a good job. I can break the news that he will be promoted 
at the next cabinet meeting. Yes, a promotion, because he is 
doing a good job. 
  [L'UNITA] In recent months, the papers have carried the news 
that a turncoat is talking about Berlusconi and his right-hand 
man, [Publitalia CEO] Marcello Dell'Utri. The latter is said -- 
by the turncoat -- to have had links with the Cosa Nostra bosses 
in the past. That is a serious allegation: Is it not an 
embarrassment to you, as interior minister in this government? 
  [Maroni] I have discussed the matter with Berlusconi. He has 
assured me that neither he nor Dell'Utri have ever had links 
with the Mafia. 
  [L'UNITA] And you trust him? 
  [Maroni] How could I remain in his government otherwise? How 
could I shake his hand? I await the conclusion of the matter 
with equanimity. I must emphasize, of course, that no charges 
have been made. Berlusconi has no problems with the law. 
  [L'UNITA] Anti-Mafia Attorney Siclari fears more massacres. 
  [Maroni] I have no particular information on that score. 
There are no specific reports. I hold Siclari in high esteem, 
and I believe him. His reasoning is convincing: The harder the 
government fights the Mafia, the higher the risk of attacks will 
be. I do not underrate that risk. 
  [L'UNITA] Let us turn to another issue: the introduction of 
an antitrust bill. Bossi has said he would be prepared to join 
forces with the opposition parties. Do you agree with him? 
  [Maroni] We in the League have our principles, and one of 
those is to combat monopolies, all monopolies. That is why we 
are prepared to fight alongside anyone, inside or outside the 
majority, who takes up the cudgels on this issue. 
  [L'UNITA] Europe is closing the doors on immigrants. 
  [Maroni] I will take no steps to have the European Union 
resolution adopted. Parliament will decide. Anyway, the 
principles set out in the resolution are the same as those 
embodied in the Martelli law. The fact of the matter is that 
this law has never been fully implemented. 
  [L'UNITA] One last question: The Ustica disaster 
[unresolved air crash in early 1980's]. You said something very 
surprising on the Maurizio Costanzo Show [TV talk show]. To all 
intents and purposes, you said that we would never get at the 
truth. 
  [Maroni] Before I arrived at the Viminale, I thought that 
the 
secret services were hiding the famous top secret file stating: 
"The aircraft crashed for the following reasons, the following 
people were responsible." But it is not true, that file does 
not exist, although that does not necessarily mean that it has 
never existed. In my opinion, a lot of papers disappeared 
between 1980 and 1990, 10 years.... There is someone in Italy 
who knows the truth. The problem is that this someone cannot be 
forced to talk. No examining magistrate can penetrate his 
conscience and his memory. If I knew who it was, I would do 
everything within my power to get him to talk.... The United 
States and France have certainly not helped the investigators. 
I wholeheartedly support Judge Priore's formal requests to the 
judicial authorities there, but I am pessimistic. We still do 
not even know what caused the crash: a bomb, a missile.... 
  [L'UNITA] What impression have you formed: Was it a bomb or 
a missile? 
  [Maroni] In my view, the plane was hit by a missile. That is 
an impression I have formed in the light of the information I 
have received and the documents I have read. The bomb theory 
may be useful to those who want to prevent the truth from 
getting out. Perhaps not for ever. Perhaps only until the truth 
will no longer have a negative impact on international relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vittoria Sivo: "Ovation for Cofferati: CGIL Has </F>
Its New Leader"] 
  [Text] The CGIL's Chianciano assembly has chosen a new 
secretary. The minister of finance previewed for the assembly 
the contents of the tax reform bill. 
  Chianciano--Sergio Cofferati will be the new general 
secretary of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor]. 
The applause he received at the end of his long speech, at eight 
o'clock in the evening, was worth more than a simple investiture 
to the man who, at the end of the month, will now clearly take 
Bruno Trentin's place. It was a spontaneous election that 
reduces to a pure formality the official election that, within 
approximately one week, will involve the 200 members of the CGIL 
leadership. Defeated at the very outset, therefore, although 
without dishonor, was Alfiero Grandi, who represents the more 
leftward-leaning wing of the Confederation. The brief and rather 
cold clapping of hands he received from the thousand-plus 
leaders and delegates of the CGIL conveyed not even a passing 
grade to Grandi and to his speech of yesterday, laced as it was 
with belligerence. There can be no doubt that the CGIL assembly 
prefers to be represented by Cofferati, a prudent and pragmatic 
negotiator with a reputation as a moderate, rather than by the 
more impetuous and inflexible Grandi. 
  Thus, by the end of its second day, the major Italian labor 
confederation's platform conference had changed into certainties 
the vague suppositions that had been floating in the air. All 
that remain for today are Bruno Trentin's concluding remarks--a 
true-to-form farewell waltz after six years spent as the CGIL's 
leader--to bring to a close a chapter of union history. 
<H5>  First Steps Toward Employment </H5>
  If the conference's evening session was enlivened by the 
Grandi-Cofferati "tournament" (with the reporters furious at the 
organizers' sadism), the morning meeting was energized by the 
presence of Giulio Tremonti, the Berlusconi government's finance 
minister, who was the sole representative of the government to 
accept Trentin's invitation. Labor Minister Mastella preferred 
to decline. 
  Although the applause that followed Tremonti's remarks was 
barely within the bounds of politeness, there were no hisses. 
Incidentally, while Tremonti patiently awaited his turn, Claudio 
Sabatini, leader of the metalworkers union, thundered against 
Berlusconi, referring to him as a "ham actor." 
  Despite even Tremonti's explicit assurances that he intended 
to structure the tax reform bill with the participation and 
cooperation of the opposition and the unions, the hostility of 
the CGIL rank and file toward the government as its "enemy" did 
not abate. 
  The minister provided no advance information on the 
mechanisms that will be used to bring about "a new system that 
is simpler and less unfair than the present one" in Italy. He 
touched briefly on the possibility that the next Council of 
Ministers will launch the first measures designed to favor 
businesses that increase the number of employees, then gave a 
lecture on the philosophy that will inspire the reform. "It will 
be a constitutional change," said the minister, "one that will 
involve parliament, and that therefore cannot but involve the 
opposition and the social partners." After all, in tax matters, 
many elements that are "identical in substance" can be found in 
the platforms of the various parties. In brief, as in all the 
Western democracies, the Berlusconi government is determined to 
not proceed, in tax matters, on the basis of forcing the will of 
the majority upon the minority. 
  The cornerstones of the reform are those for which Tremonti 
has long been pressing: a gradual shifting of taxation from the 
central government to the regions, from direct to indirect 
taxes, from the complex to the simple. "There is no hope of 
restructuring the system--he stressed--if the circuitousness of 
itemized taxation is not broken. The issue is finding a balance 
between benefits and sacrifices. Meanwhile, the national 
taxation system will have to remain in place to enable the state 
to continue functioning." 
  The issues of the CGIL leadership succession and of its 
relations with the new government turned out to be tightly 
interwoven. One after the other, Grandi and Cofferati outlined 
diametrically opposed approaches with respect to the new team at 
Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]. 
  Not by happenstance did Grandi advocate a profound future 
distrust of any agreement modeled on the 23 July 1993 accord 
signed with the Ciampi administration. Grandi expressed the hope 
that this agreement, the fruit of a compromise dictated by 
emergency, "should it collapse, will collapse to the left and 
not to the right." Cofferati, on the other hand, pressed the 
view that the famous entente of a year ago is vital to labor: 
"It is a guarantee of our right to negotiate." 
  The two contenders argued on different wavelengths. Alfiero 
Grandi defined the present government as a "videocracy" with 
which labor cannot but clash: "Let us gird for battle. Without a 
shift in policy we will not make it"; and "Any thought of fair 
play is unrealistic." And to those who might argue that his is a 
prejudicial attitude, he would reply that "The first measures 
instituted by Berlusconi immediately dashed what frankly had 
been unfounded hopes to begin with"; and that "it is impossible 
not to be concerned when the budget minister is the likes of 
Pagliarini." 
  Without directly challenging Grandi by name at any time, 
Sergio Cofferati rebutted his antagonist's speech point by 
point. And as his own speech progressed, the audience--or at 
least the majority of the listeners--seemed increasingly 
relieved at the grit their favorite candidate was displaying. 
This time there was no self-consciousness on his part, but a 
pressing delivery with clear proposals, even at the risk of 
arousing a measure of unpopularity. 
  "We can envision a clash with the government, but not on 
abstract demands. It must be on the issue of a policy consistent 
with the need to restore public finances on a sound footing." In 
Cofferati's opinion austerity must not be abandoned, even with 
respect to the reduction in working hours. 
  Cofferati deemed the policy on working hours to be crucial, 
but he very decidedly opposed a demand that "would presume to 
dump the entire cost of this operation on the state." "We would 
not be credible," he repeated. 
<H5>  Labor Unity Relaunched </H5>
  In his view, the model to be followed is that of the 
Volkswagen union agreement, "based on a pact that, in a moment 
of crisis, management makes with labor organizations." In order 
to avoid thousands of layoffs, the labor unions had the courage 
to accept a reduction in wages. Similarly, in Italy, according 
to Cofferati, to avoid a break in the pact between generations, 
future productivity dividends must not be converted in their 
entirety into wage increases--the maintaining of real wages is 
sufficient--but rather channeled into the creation of new jobs. 
  Appreciable differences between the two participants in this 
duel were noted with respect to another important issue, namely, 
labor unity. A debate on "when" is reductive; it is better by 
far, according to Cofferati, to begin immediately the process of 
unifying the CGIL with the CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade 
Unions], and the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] 
because "no single confederation, alone, can succeed in 
attaining the objectives set forth by Bruno Trentin." 
  Concluding his remarks, Cofferati turned to Trentin with an 
appeal, that he continue making his "irreplaceable contribution" 
to the CGIL in whatever manner he thinks best. And of his 
internal opponents he asked that they not allow their right of 
dissent to compromise "the transparency, the respect, and the 
solidarity of the leadership group."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet: "Government Will Stand By Its </F>
Policy and Not Withdraw Labor Reform"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government takes the 12 June 
[European and Andalusian] election defeat as a "serious 
warning," and will try to regain lost ground by throwing itself 
into administration and without changing its policy -- 
particularly in the economic sphere -- asserting that the labor 
reform will not be withdrawn. Thus it believes that stability is 
guaranteed, especially after CiU [Convergence and Union] leader 
Jordi Pujol has reiterated his support for continuing the 
legislative term on the basis of cooperation with the government. 
  These, in essence, are the conclusions that the cabinet 
reached yesterday after discussing the political situation 
caused by the electoral setback of the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] in the European and Andalusian elections. 
<H5>  Firm Stability </H5>
  Minister of the Presidency Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba 
emphasized 
as the foremost element of the government's analysis that there 
is a situation of political stability. "What the events of the 
past few days show," he said, "is that the government's 
stability is firm and that it has been reaffirmed by the meeting 
which the Generalitat [Catalan autonomous government] premier 
held with the prime minister Thursday [16 June]." Therefore, 
this is a government "that has the ability to conduct its 
political activity with the necessary parliamentary stability." 
  Perez Rubalcaba stated that the government members must "put 
their backs into it" -- that is, pick up the thread of the 
administration begun after the legislative elections of a year 
ago, and succeed in making society see that there is a 
determined political will to surmount the crisis and clean up 
public life. The third main aspect of the the government's 
activity is the implementation of autonomy, a matter on which it 
wishes to continue to work for the implementation of the various 
autonomy statutes. 
  The government believes that, in the first place, the 
measures concerning the labor reform that have been approved are 
producing good results. Hence, the government has no intention 
of altering this initiative, as United Left and the trade unions 
have demanded. 
  With respect to the voices in the PSOE calling for a 
leftward 
shift with more marked Socialist features, Perez Rubalcaba 
stated that "party members are free, and say what they please," 
although "there are bodies that must finally decide what is to 
be done." Next Monday, he pointed out, there is a meeting of the 
Executive Committee from which "the party's stance on the 
elections and the future will emerge. All we party members must 
abide by that stance, because the Executive Committee is elected 
in order to exercise political leadership." 
  In any event, Perez Rubalcaba emphasized that, in the 
government's opinion, the labor reform "is a good law," that was 
drafted for one purpose -- to create jobs. "In that," he 
stated, "it is a law that represents progress. We are already 
seeing its results, which will be greater over the next few 
months. The reform is producing excellent results as far as new 
contracts are concerned." 
  According to Rubalcaba, nobody in the government has 
suggested the advisability of changing the policy of alliances 
that the PSOE is maintaining in this legislative term. He 
remarked in this connection that, following the legislative 
elections, the government sought agreements on the basis of 
compatibility of programs, and this resulted in the cooperation 
with CiU and the Basque Nationalist Party. The survival of the 
agreement of programs was made clear this week at the meeting 
between Gonzalez and Pujol, and so there is no reason to change 
the policy of alliances. 
  With respect to the causes of the electoral setback, there 
are, in Rubalcaba's opinion, "obvious" causes; the corruption 
cases -- "which could have estranged some citizens from the 
PSOE" -- and the economic crisis, because although there is a 
recovery, "there are many people who still do not perceive it." 
Rubalcaba intensified the self-critical tone in saying that the 
government's basic policies should not be reformulated, but in 
the knowledge that "citizens have become estranged from the 
government" for the aforementioned reasons. 
  "What the government should do," he continued, "is set under 
way the necessary means to combat the economic crisis, create 
jobs, and pursue corruption. That is what we are doing, but 
probably not to a sufficient extent. So the government has 
concluded that it is necessary to work harder and more 
thoroughly, and explain our policies better." 
  In short, it is the government's conviction that "we have 
accomplished things, but have probably been unable to explain 
this, and it is reasonable that we concern ourselves with this 
and therefore combine our administration work -- each of us in 
our ministerial areas -- with greater explanation to the public, 
greater closeness with respect to the various sectors, and 
greater dialogue, which has developed, but perhaps has not 
crystallized sufficiently."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Maria Brunet and Josep Gisbert: "Gonzalez </F>
Assures Pujol on Economic Policy; Pujol Reaffirms Support for 
Gonzalez"] 
  [Text] Madrid/Barcelona -- [Convergence and Union (CiU) 
leader] Jordi Pujol stated yesterday evening that the support of 
CiU for the government "is guaranteed if program agreements are 
reached," after [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez assured him 
that the government will maintain its current economic policy 
and its readiness to reach agreements in the autonomy sphere. 
The two commitments mean the continuation of the cooperation 
between the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] and CiU, 
which could take the form of program agreements when the 1995 
budgets begin to be debated in September. Gonzalez and Pujol -- 
who met for over two hours at the Moncloa Palace, following the 
former's return from Colombia yesterday and before the latter 
leaves today for Indonesia on an official visit -- were in 
agreement in rejecting the method of a confidence motion in 
order to restore an image of stability to political life and on 
the fact that the important thing is the support of a sufficient 
parliamentary majority. 
  "The prime minister," Pujol said, "has asserted very 
emphatically that he intends to continue the policy that has 
been conducted so far, especially in the economic sphere. We 
are in complete agreement on the country's needs right now and 
on how matters must be directed. These months are very decisive 
for the future for several years ahead, because the recovery is 
beginning in Spain and in Europe, and we must take advantage of 
it by adopting effective measures." Pujol, who paused for 
several minutes on leaving the meeting, explained that he put it 
to Gonzalez that for CiU "the important thing is for us to reach 
agreement on certain aspects of a program nature," because for 
CiU a pact on the economic and autonomy spheres is vital. With 
respect to the former, it is "essential" that "support for the 
productive economy" continue, and that measures can be adopted 
to reduce unemployment. 
  For these aims to be achieved, there must be a 
"parliamentary 
majority" that will operate as such, and CiU will continue to 
guarantee it as long as the program agreements last, Pujol 
added. He specified that if they did not come about, "our 
support would cease to exist." The premier cited as instances 
the nationalist coalition's support for some of the most 
important laws debated so far, as well as the fact that the 
government is receptive to other proposals, such as the proposal 
for the right to write-offs for the replacement of production 
equipment, which is being approved by the cabinet today. Pujol 
also stated that Gonzalez told him with "conviction" that, 
although there are discordant voices, the PSOE is determined 
that the policy conducted so far will continue. 
  With respect to autonomy matters, Pujol stressed that CiU's 
demands are "advantageous" not just for Catalonia but for all 
the autonomous communities, and specified that the Generalitat 
has always proposed aims that lie within strict observance of 
the statute [of autonomy] and that "can be accepted" by all the 
parties and the public. The Generalitat premier went to the 
meeting with the intention of succeeding in stabilizing the 
political situation until September, in a desire to gain time 
for the negotiation on autonomy with the government to take 
place and for the outline of the 1995 budgets to begin to take 
shape, and thus be able to support Gonzalez in a confidence 
motion if he decided to submit one at that time. 
  The analysis that Pujol and the prime minister make with 
respect to the messages of 12 June have many points of 
agreement, and in view of this the most likely thing is that the 
government will reach agreement with CiU on a parliamentary 
strategy starting from September. Yesterday, two hypotheses 
were being put forward: There could be a confidence motion on 
the basis of a policy statement by the government, which CiU 
would support, or the debate would be confined to the discussion 
of the 1995 budgets. This option was the one that initially 
aroused the greatest interest in the government, although the 
impression has subsequently spread that CiU's support in the 
budget debate would not be sufficient; rather, that a more 
forceful and general expression of support for the government's 
activity is needed, and this can only be achieved through a 
confidence motion.

<F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Swedish No Overturns Finnish </F>
Yes?"] 
  [Excerpt] If Sweden and Norway say no in their European 
Union [EU] referenda, a Finnish yes in the referendum on 16 
October will not be confirmed by the Eduskunta. 
  This view was expressed by many Eduskunta deputies, 
particularly from the Center Party, when the legislation on the 
referendum was yesterday finally passed in its third reading in 
the Eduskunta. 
  Markku Laukkanen (Center Party) said that he believes that a 
third of Eduskunta deputies will bring down the EU agreement if 
Sweden and Norway reject their agreements in their referenda. 
  Hannu Kemppainen, his party colleague, claimed that the 
result of the referendum can only be binding on Eduskunta 
deputies if it can be interpreted as representing a permanent 
body of public opinion among the people. The result in Sweden 
could, however, reverse public opinion. We should not have 
arranged things like this, he said, blaming the situation on 
President Martti Ahtisaari, Social Democratic Party chairman 
Paavo Lipponen, and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen 
(National Coalition Party). 
  Mirja Ryynanen (Center Party) made her contribution by 
saying 
that if after the referendum important new information relating 
to the issue becomes available, the Eduskunta should naturally 
take it into consideration. Such new information could be the 
negative stances of the other Nordic countries. 
  At its party congress last weekend the Center Party resolved 
that "the Center Party in Finland will respect any referendum 
result that arises in this way." By "this way" the congress 
meant that the national support package is approved before the 
referendum in a form that corresponds to the government's 
decision in principle. However, the congress resolution 
contained no mention of the Swedish and Norwegian referenda. 
  Liberal People's Party chairman Tuulikki Ukkola reacted to 
the Center Party deputies' statements and claimed that these 
undermine the foundation for a referendum. 
  Constitutional Committee chairman Sauli Niinisto (National 
Coalition Party) wondered why Finland's decision should be tied 
to Sweden's. According to this argument, if Sweden had been 
voting first there would be no need for a referendum in Finland. 
And if the referenda were to take place simultaneously only the 
Swedish result would be binding, he said. 
  Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Pertti Paasio (Social 
Democratic Party) interpreted those debaters who want to tie 
Finland's decision to Sweden's to be saying that they want 
Finland to follow Sweden's decision, but only on the condition 
that Sweden takes the same view as a minority in the Finnish 
Eduskunta. 
  The debate was started by the Left Alliance's Esko Seppanen 
who had distributed an amendment to the effect that a new 
referendum should be arranged "if the other Nordic countries' 
referenda change to a significant extent the base for Finland's 
membership of the EU" -- in simple terms: if Sweden and Norway 
say no after a Finnish yes. 
  However, Seppanen did not table the amendment officially. If 
it had been voted down now, it would be more difficult to 
arrange such a referendum if such a situation were to arise. 
  Unusually the Eduskunta also debated the nature of the EU, 
whether the Union is developing in a federalist direction, and 
whether Finland should promote or slow down such a development. 
  EU opponents in particular argued that the EU is developing 
into a federal state. This argument was rejected by National 
Coalition Party Eduskunta group chairman Ben Zyskowicz who 
stressed that the creation of a federal state presupposes 
agreement and that in particular the enlargement of the EU 
currently taking place means that its structure as an alliance 
of states -- the cooperation between national states -- will 
remain for a long time to come. 
  This made Esko Seppanen assert that EU supporters are 
entering the referendum with contradictory views of the EU: 
Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) and now the National 
Coalition Party are leading us into an EU of nation-states, 
while Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen is leading 
us into the federal state of the EU. 
  Lipponen was not in his place, but Pertti Paasio replied 
that 
Lipponen had meant that looser integration is not necessarily 
more advantageous for small member states as is more solid 
integration. 
  Johannes Koskinen (Social Democratic Party) admitted that 
both in Europe and in Finland the Social Democrats have 
conflicting views on this issue. 
  The legislation on the referendum was passed unanimously, 
because its content had already been settled in the votes during 
its second reading. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Goran Eriksson: "Bildt Wants To Discuss the EU </F>
With Carlsson"] 
  [Text] A public discussion of how the various parties want 
the European Union [EU] to develop. 
  This is proposed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate 
Coalition Party) in an open letter addressed to opposition 
leader Ingvar Carlsson. 
  In the letter Bildt writes that he warmly welcomes the clear 
decision on the question of EU membership reached at the Social 
Democratic Party congress at the weekend. 
  But the prime minister also writes that he was "very 
surprised by the message from the congress that the lid must now 
be put on the Europe debate until after the election campaign." 
  Carl Bildt argues that the government that is elected in 
September will represent Sweden in important negotiations on the 
EU's future, provided that the referendum says yes to the EU. 
  The prime minister therefore takes the view that it is "our 
democratic duty to make clear to the voters before the election 
in September along what lines we want Europe cooperation to 
develop after November." 
  Therefore Carl Bildt proposed a discussion in early August. 
  Yesterday the letter did not raise pulse rates in the Social 
Democratic camp. 
  "If Carl Bildt had listened more carefully to what was said 
at our congress he would not have needed to write this letter," 
said Laila Edholm of the Social Democrats' press service. She 
gave assurances that the Social Democrats have not put the lid 
on the EU debate, but that the actual campaign will naturally be 
intensified after the election. 
  Ingvar Carlsson is currently on holiday and the invitation 
to 
a public debate will therefore have to wait until he comes back 
to work in mid-July.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt </F>
by Thomas Michelsen; place and date not given] 
  [Text] As members of the European Union [EU] we will have 
a security bonus, Prime Minister Carl Bildt declared. If in the 
future someone threatens northern Europe it will be a threat not 
only to northern Europe, but also to the whole system of 
European cooperation. 
  ``It is true that I do not believe that red-brown revanchism 
will win power in Russia. But if this were to happen, 
membership in the EU gives increased security. When Finland, 
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark participate in the EU's common 
foreign and security policy there will be a clearer linkage 
between European and northern European stability. 
  ``This is of significance for the three Baltic states. And 
for relations between West Europe and Russia, which only meet up 
here in the north,'' the prime minister said. 
  [Michelsen] But could Sweden not come to be seen as an 
outpost of one of the great powers -- precisely that which our 
old policy of neutrality wanted to avoid? An outpost that the 
other great power (read: the former Soviet Union) would attack 
immediately when it came to the crunch? 
  "They could suspect that we were part of the other side -- 
something that we were to a large extent, it has emerged," Carl 
Bildt said. "What has surprised me most in what has now emerged 
is the construction of bases. That we built air bases to 
receive large bombers returning after attacks on the Soviet 
Union. They were not based in Sweden, thank God. Instead they 
were to carry out their attacks on the Soviet Union from bases a 
long way away, and for them to be able then to get out of the 
unpleasantness Sweden had landing places ready. It is obvious 
that this was known in the Soviet Union. It is not particularly 
difficult to measure the length of the runways at airports. 
  ``Now the situation is very different,'' Bildt said. ``Now 
we are entering into open cooperation with the other European 
democracies with the aim of achieving security and stability in 
Europe as a whole. 
  ``This cannot be compared with the policy in the fifties and 
sixties when we played a role in the nuclear strategy of the 
Western side. A role that was brought to the knowledge of the 
government of the country and no one else. But known in the 
Soviet Union. 
  ``Then, in the fifties and sixties, we had a confrontation 
between superpowers. Two systems stood armed against each 
other. The whole time there was a risk of nuclear war. This is 
something we no longer have. And the nuclear arms are becoming 
outdated. The nuclear balance means less and less and the bloc 
system is being broken up. Instead systems of cooperation are 
on their way. But dangers and instability could also arise in 
this new situation. And then the security and cooperation 
systems will mean a great deal.'' 
  [Michelsen] What has the government achieved in respect of 
the submarine question? 
  "We do not know much more about why violations occur. But we 
have theories that are better founded," Carl Bildt said. ``And 
Russian experts have attested that there are minisubmarines in 
our archipelagoes. But every `indication' is not a submarine. 
We had submarines here last summer, if on a somewhat limited 
scale. We have also seen a change in how they behave. And 
there have been certain indications this year too, even though 
they have not been fully analyzed yet. 
  ``This is a very big security problem. We have moved 
forward in our contacts with the Russians. But we have not 
reached our goal,'' Bildt said. 
  And he believes that it will be a long time before the 
submarine question is answered. 
  So what chance does Carl Bildt think he has of remaining in 
office after the election? He has just lost a minister in his 
government and opinion poll figures have long been pretty awful 
for the government. 
  But Bildt demonstrated a steely optimism. Most things are 
splendid. 
  "It is really quite remarkable. We have done everything we 
said we would do. I have just dug out and reread the government 
declaration from October 1991. There is only one thing we have 
not managed to do. That was to make it possible to dentists to 
set up their own practices -- something that New Democracy 
blocked," Bildt said. "The Oresund bridge was the last big 
thing that still remained. We have cleared that hurdle now." 
  [Michelsen] But despite this the opinion poll figures are so 
bad. 
  "What is needed is a solid election campaign. Then the 
opposition will also find itself with its back against the wall 
with its alternatives being scrutinized. And then people will 
see that the only thing that is certain about the Social 
Democrats is that they will raise taxes significantly." 
  [Michelsen] But has not the government pushed this message 
quite a lot of times? 
  "But it has not hit home. It drowns in other issues," Carl 
Bildt said. "And do not forget that a third of voters make up 
their minds during the election campaign itself. An election is 
always a very open affair, regardless of the opinion poll 
figures." 
  [Michelsen] But are not the Social Democrats usually good at 
election campaigns? 
  "No, that is partly a myth. It is true that the Social 
Democrats still have a powerful machine. But now people are no 
longer as tied to authority and they do not accept diktats from 
the trade unions in the same way," Carl Bildt said. ``As a 
result the Social Democrats' relative upper hand in election 
campaigns has almost disappeared. 
  ``They could find themselves in the psychologically 
difficult 
situation of having to fight an election campaign with opinion 
poll figures that are falling.'' 
  Carl Bildt said that he is convinced that in four months' 
time he will still be leading a government consisting of the 
same four nonsocialist parties. 
  "And I see no reason to change the government team. But this 
is up to the various parties. The choice of team players is not 
up to me."

<F P=106> [Report by Hans O. Alfredsson: "Center Party Congress </F>
Supports Party Leader Johansson"] 
  [Text] Falun -- Olof Johansson has the support of his 
party. This was made clear when the Center Party congress in 
Falun was yesterday given the opportunity to discuss the 
political situation after the maneuverings around the Oresund 
bridge -- and on this issue there was no debate. 
  Bengt-Ake Berg from Jonkoping County was a voice crying in 
the wilderness when he declared that he feels concern about 
where the Center Party is going. When he joined the party 20 
years ago the Center Party had 25 percent of voters behind it. 
  Today support has shrunk to a quarter of this figure. 
"Perhaps we should do what our fellow Centrists in Norway did, 
when they found themselves in the same situation -- that is, 
leave the government," Berg wondered. 
  No one took him up on this. Instead Per-Ola Eriksson, 
Andreas Carlgren, Rolf Kenneryd, and Michael Artursson set the 
tone by praising Olof Johansson in quick succession and 
asserting that both he and the party have acted completely 
correctly. 
  "I think that we should be proud to have a party leader who 
demonstrates that politics means something," Artursson said to 
warm applause. 
  As he put it himself, Olof Johansson only wanted to add a 
few 
"footnotes" to what is contained in the Center Party's election 
platform. He also wanted to clarify his reply the other day 
when he was asked whether he can envisage ruling together with 
the Social Democrats. 
  The election platform remains firm, the Center Party leader 
assured his audience. 
  This means that the Center Party is striving for a 
nonsocialist majority with increased influence for Center Party 
policies. There is no other "objective" in this fall's election. 
  Since both the political and the economic situations are a 
little "unstable" it might be wise not "to go around ruling 
things out," Olof Johansson declared. 
  That was what he had wanted to say in his remark about not 
ruling out cooperation with the Social Democrats. 
  "We must talk about what we want. We must be clear when it 
comes to our election platform, but we must not rule out 
different options. But this does not mean a greater desire to 
work with the Social Democrats, for example, on an objective 
foundation. Nothing has changed on this point." 
  In the light of recent events Johansson himself has "not 
found any reason to make even a single correction, to change a 
single comma" in the election platform. 
  On the subject of the Oresund bridge he told the congress 
yesterday that "the bridge was more important than an intact 
government for three of the present government's parties: They 
had a very clear choice. Our view was no secret. They knew 
what it was."

<F P=106> [Report by Sigfrid Leijonhufvud: "Victorious Franzen Starts </F>
the Election Campaign"] 
  [Text] "Let's get moving," was the message from New 
Democracy's [NYD] latest leadership team when it called a news 
conference yesterday afternoon in the Riksdag building. 
  With preliminary voting figures of 1,543 against 301, 
Vivianne Franzen's party executive won approval in a vote by 
2,960 party members, and it wants now to set the election 
campaign in motion. 
  However, the enthusiasm of the new party chairman, wearing 
red culottes and a jacket with a white sailor collar, was 
dampened by the fact that the battle for the party's funds seems 
to be continuing. 
  Day-to-day payments can be made as long as [rival party 
leader] Harriet Colliander or members of the party executive 
elected at the regular party congress in April and members of 
the new party executive countersign the bills. 
  But neither of the executives will be able to get their 
hands 
on the money needed for an election campaign as long as they are 
blocked by the other side. 
  "If she carries on like this after this vote, her only aim 
is 
to sink the party," Vivianne Franzen declared while the old 
party executive gathered for a meeting elsewhere in the Riksdag 
building. 
  Those who support Colliander do not consider the new 
executive to have been appointed according to the party's 
statutes. 
  Therefore it is not legitimate and should not have access to 
party funds that currently are in excess of 7 million kronor. 
  Stefan Kihlberg, the party secretary on the former party 
executive, has wanted the matter to be brought before a court, 
and according to Franzen the Stockholm District Court will 
announce within 14 days whether it intends to investigate the 
matter. 
  Yesterday evening the two party factions met to discuss the 
problems regarding party funds, among other things. Vivianne 
Franzen left the group before 2100 hours, and the meeting broke 
up just before midnight. 
  Stefan Kihlberg said after the meeting that the Colliander 
executive does not accept the vote by the party membership, but 
remains firm that the matter should be settled in court. 
  Taking as its point of departure the party program, NYD will 
raise issues such as the budget deficit, refugee policy, and 
youth unemployment in the election campaign, Vivianne Franzen, 
seconded by Sten Dybeck, said. 
  Both expressed regrets that the established parties are 
incapable of solving the nation's problems. "This shows that 
New Democracy is needed." 
  Proposed spending cuts include a 50-percent cut in 
development aid, reductions in the cost of accepting refugees, 
and naturally a cut in the financial support for political 
parties. 
  A 50-percent cut in the value-added tax on services is also 
in the program. 
  Vivianne Franzen described NYD as a youth party. 
  "I myself can attract beer-drinking youths under 20. They 
are my fans," she said laughing.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The Balkans, Albania, Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], and the Cyprus issue were among the 
topics on the U.S. agenda at the Pentagon meeting of Greek and 
U.S. Defense Ministers Yerasimos Arsenis and William Perry. 
  According to reliable information, during the one-hour 
meeting, the U.S. Pentagon mentioned: 
  a) The situation in the Balkans might remain fragile and 
this 
is why the U.S. side is examining the repercussions of possible 
developments that will affect Skopje and Albania. 
  b) The U.S. Secretary of State made a lengthy reference to 
the issue of Albania, leaving the impression that the U.S. 
Government efforts to help that country include military 
cooperation through the new Partnership for Peace doctrine. 
Perry did not discuss the Greek minority rights issue, but 
conveyed the broader view of the U.S. Government. He mentioned 
that despite minor problems, Greece can and should help Albania 
during this period. According to the same information, the 
Greek delegation appeared willing to examine ways of 
"tripartite" cooperation (Greece, United States, Albania) within 
the greater framework of Partnership for Peace. In accordance 
with a Greek proposal, this issue will be discussed extensively 
during Perry's official visit to Athens on 19 July. It is noted 
that during this period, Perry will have a clearly "Balkan tour" 
and will visit Bucharest, Sofia, Skopje, Athens, Tirana, and 
Sarajevo. 
  c) The U.S. military delegation was particularly insistent 
on the issue of Skopje. The U.S. officials repeatedly expressed 
their concerns about the recent border "incidents" between 
Serbia and Skopje. Some international newspapers had played up 
these incidents. 
  According to the same sources, a U.S. interlocutor at the 
Pentagon expressed "his great concern" about "the fate" of the 
U.S. peacekeeping force in Skopje "if something goes wrong." 
  d) The "traditional" reference to the Cyprus issue was made. 
The Greek delegation proposed that an extensive discussion on 
this issue as well as on the defense doctrine be conducted in 
Athens in July. 
<H5>  Larisa </H5>
  The Greek side immediately expressed interest in active 
participation in the Partnership for Peace, stressing that as a 
strong Balkan country, Greece can play a particularly 
constructive role in this effort, thus "upgrading" Greece's bid 
to be the headquarters of "NATO's multinational swift 
intervention force," which is being pursued by both Athens and 
Ankara. 
  Following this, the defense minister preferred not to raise 
at this meeting the issue of an air subheadquarters, preferring 
to discuss the issue of a Larisa headquarters during his meeting 
with Perry in Athens. 
  During a recess in this meeting, the Greek delegation raised 
the issue of redistributing annuities from U.S. military aid to 
Greece. The tremendous debt (6 billion dollars, 2 billion of 
which are from taxes) is pressuring the Greek side. This is why 
a proposal was made for a favorable way to "write off" the two 
billion. 
<H5>  On CNN </H5>
  In an 8-minute interview on the U.S. network CNN, which was 
relayed last night, the Greek defense minister supported the 
Greek positions on the Greek-Turkish differences and the issue 
of Skopje.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexis Papakhelas from Washington] </F>
  [Text] According to intense rumors that have been 
circulating lately in the U.S. State Department, U.S. Ambassador 
in Athens Thomas Niles will soon be replaced by Stephen Oxman, 
the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. These 
rumors have drawn a strong reaction from career diplomats, who 
believe it would be awkward to remove Niles early in order to 
"accommodate" a political figure who is being removed from the 
Clinton administration. 
  Oxman succeeded Niles in his position as assistant secretary 
of state for European affairs, but two weeks ago it was decided 
to replace him because of ineffectiveness. Oxman is a close 
friend of the Clinton family and maintains excellent relations 
with Congress. Niles was appointed by former President George 
Bush and is connected to the Republican Party. The White House 
will make a final decision in the next few weeks.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that the 
government is trying to find rooted and lasting solutions to the 
country's problems. Addressing the True Path Party's 
parliamentary group, Ciller said that great advances have been 
achieved in the struggle against terror. [passage omitted] 
  Ciller said the Turkish government will continue to support 
a 
just and realistic solution in Cyprus to be attained through 
negotiations. Noting that the Greek Cypriot side has adopted an 
intransigent attitude, Ciller added that the attitude adopted by 
Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of Northern 
Cyprus, has proven that the Turkish Cypriot side favors peace. 
  Ciller recalled that the U.S. Congress will be adopting a 
bill stipulating that the arms to be sent or sold to Turkey in 
1995 cannot be employed for domestic security purposes and added: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I view these developments in the 
U.S. Congress as a great injustice against our country and 
people. The U.S. Senate is actually telling us that U.S. arms 
will not be employed in the struggle against the PKK [Workers 
Party of Kurdistan], which the U.S. Administration has 
explicitly described as a terror organization and whose 
international links are well known. Such a condition is 
tantamount to supporting terror and remaining a spectator to 
attempts to divide Turkey. [end recording] 
  Ciller stated that the attitude of the U.S. Congress can be 
linked to efforts being exerted by a group acting with prejudice 
against Turkey and the Turkish people. She noted that the 
government will do all it can to rectify this injustice, adding 
that a delegation composed of parliamentarians and press 
officials will be sent to the United States to clarify the 
issue. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, June 23 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman Demirel 
on Thursday [23 June] said that relations between Turkey and 
Uzbekistan are developing in line with both countries' interests. 
  Demirel was speaking at the welcoming ceremony for Uzbek 
President Islam Karimov who arrived in Turkey for a two-day 
official visit. 
  `These relations are carried out based on the principles of 
equality, non-interference in domestic affairs, and mutual 
interest, love and respect,' he said. `Cooperation between the 
two countries will contribute to the development and welfare of 
the region of which Turkey and Uzbekistan are two important 
countries.' 
  He said the foreign trade volume between the two countries 
in 
1992 was 75 million U.S. dollars and this increased to 245 
million dollars in 1993. 
  He said the financial portrait of the Turkish firms 
investing 
and doing business in Uzbekistan amounts to 446 million dollars, 
with Turkish Eximbank opening credits of 250 million dollars, of 
which half has already been used.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] After a welcoming ceremony, 
President Suleyman Demirel and Uzbek President Islam Karimov 
held a meeting. The Turkish and Uzbek delegations later held 
official talks led by the two presidents. The Turkish delegation 
was composed of Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, National Defense 
Minister Mehmet Golhan, Justice Minister Seyfi Oktay, National 
Education Minister Nevzat Ayaz, Agriculture and Village Affairs 
Minister Refaiddin Sahin and Transportation Minister Mehmet 
Kostepen. The Uzbek delegation was composed of deputy prime 
ministers Mahamadzhan Karabayev and Yurodrov Osmanov and the 
foreign affairs, defense, justice, communications ministers. 
The two presidents signed the joint communique after the 
official talks. Furthermore, the pertinent ministers signed 
consular, judicial assistance, civil aviation agreements. In 
addition a protocol on consultations and cooperation was signed 
by the two foreign ministers. 
  In a statement after the talks, Demirel said all aspects of 
bilateral relations and cooperation were discussed, adding that 
views were also exchanged on regional and international issues. 
He noted that the brotherly Central Asian countries, primarily 
Uzbekistan, have become significant economic and trade partners 
for Turkey in the last two and a half years. Pointing out that 
Turkish contractors and entrepreneurs have undertaken projects 
worth some $2.5 billion in Central Asia, Demirel noted that 
Turkey's foreign trade volume with this region soared to $550 
million in 1993. He stated that at the talks the two sides 
agreed that bilateral relations should be further strengthened, 
expanded and enhanced. Pointing out that the two sides 
confirmed that the two countries share similar views regarding 
regional and international problems, Demirel stressed that they 
have also determined that Turkish-Uzbek relations and 
cooperation contribute to regional and world peace. 
  Giving information on the joint communique, Demirel said the 
two sides have verified that some 60 agreements and protocols 
have been signed since 1991 and have expressed their 
satisfaction over this observation. Demirel added: In 
conclusion, our talks with Karimov have been extremely 
beneficial and it has given a new impetus to our relations. 
  Karimov expressed the belief that the talks have been very 
significant and that great development has been achieved in 
bilateral relations. Noting that he has visited many foreign 
countries in the last two years, Karimov added that this time he 
is being hosted in a brotherly country and that he is very 
happy. Pointing out that many issues concerning both countries 
were taken up during his meeting with Demirel, Karimov added 
that the meeting was most beneficial. 
  Demirel is currently hosting a dinner in honor of Karimov, 
who will be leaving Turkey tomorrow.

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel gave a dinner in honor of 
Uzbek President Islam Karimov at Cankaya Mansion this evening. 
  In a speech at the dinner, President Demirel said that the 
Turkish nation was elated when it heard of the independence of 
its Uzbek brothers, with whom it has special historical, 
cultural, language, and religious ties. He pointed out that 
despite the differences between the two countries caused by long 
years of separation and foreign influences, Turkey and 
Uzbekistan share the same roots. He added that the two 
countries share the same fairy tales, epics, legends, and 
heroes. This is the foundation of our common legacy, he 
stressed. 
  Demirel recalled that immediately after Uzbekistan gained 
its 
independence, cooperation between the two countries grew 
significantly within a short time. He stressed that Turkey 
considers it its political and moral responsibility to help 
brotherly Uzbekistan in every field. He added: As before, 
Turkey will continue to fulfill this responsibility on the basis 
of [word indistinct] of two equal and sovereign states, and of 
course, on the basis of noninterference in each other's domestic 
affairs, mutual respect, and interest. 
  In turn, Uzbek President Karimov said that his country wants 
to develop relations with Turkey in every field and that this 
will benefit both countries. He pointed out that there are 
extensive opportunities in his country in every field, adding 
that Uzbekistan wants to benefit from Turkey's experience in 
various spheres. Karimov added that commercial relations between 
the two countries are developing with each passing day and that 
close to 100 Turkish companies are active in Uzbekistan. 
  Karimov will leave Turkey tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Moscow's Obstruction of </F>
Turkmenistan's Natural Gas"] 
  [Text] It has been ascertained that Russia has made 
initiatives to obstruct the laying of a pipeline for 
transporting Turkmenistan's natural gas to Turkey and Europe. 
Russia has been buying Turkmenistan's natural gas at a very low 
price and selling it to Turkey and Europe for three times as 
much as it pays for it. Obviously, it neither wants to lose that 
resource nor to allow Turkmenistan to become wealthy and rid 
itself from Moscow's influence. 
  It is reported that allowing Russia to become a member of 
the 
pipeline consortium--which has been established by Turkmenistan, 
Iran, and Turkey--was powerless to obstruct Moscow's influence. 
Although Turkey is a member of that consortium, BOTAS [Pipelines 
and Petroleum Transportation Corporation] does not have any say 
in it. Meanwhile, planning work cannot be carried out because of 
Russia's bureaucratic obstructions. No concrete project has 
been drawn up yet. Consequently, the funds that are required for 
the laying of the pipeline have not been acquired. Some $5 
billion are required for the project. 
  President Suleyman Demirel held talks with President 
Saparmurad Niyazov in Ankara yesterday. He informed him that it 
is of vital importance to supply Turkemenistan's natural gas to 
Turkey within two years at the latest. Demirel also asked 
Niyazov to use his influence to overcome Russia's obstructions.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas received Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative, at 1100 today. In a 
statement to the correspondents after the meeting, which lasted 
nearly 90 minutes, Denktas said that Joe Clark has not been able 
to convey UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's letters to 
the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides because of Greek Cypriot 
leader Glavkos Kliridhis' negative approach. Clark has been 
unable to fulfill his mission as a result of Kliridhis' 
approach, he said. Denktas said the following: 
  [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Clark has been unable to 
convey 
the document or letter the UN secretary general is reported to 
have sent to the two sides. We have been informed by other 
sources that Glavkos Kliridhis talked with the UN secretary 
general by telephone for 45 minutes yesterday. He warned 
Butrus-Ghali that he should not be given a document and that he 
will resign if a document is conveyed to him. As far was we 
know, Kliridhis has objected to many points on the 
confidence-building measures. He pretended to agree, however, 
because he believed that the ball was in our court. His design 
was foiled when we agreed with the UN officials on all the 
issues. Consequently, he has moved to make a threat. Therefore, 
I was compelled to ask Mr. Clark whether he traveled all that 
way just to say hello to us. He replied that he believed that 
his talks with us were useful and that they gave him an 
opportunity to learn more about the problems. Obviously, he was 
unable to fulfill his mission because of Kliridhis' approach. 
  We asked Mr. Clark why the UN secretary general has not 
submitted a report to the UN Security Council to inform it of 
the developments that have taken place since 30 May and the 
initiatives the Turkish Cypriot side has made in goodwill, 
particularly the sacrifices it has made for the sake of reaching 
and signing of an agreement. We asked why he had failed to do 
so during the past 23 days, regardless of the fact that he had 
promised to submit a report. 
  Kliridhis will use the UN secretary general's 30 May report 
in the meeting to be held in Corfu. That report blames the 
Turkish Cypriot side. Is there an agreement to support 
Kliridhis? We insist that a realistic report be submitted. A 
decision at Corfu in favor of the Greek Cypriot side will have 
negative effects. It would be useful for all sides concerned to 
realize that. We underlined that to Mr. Clark. He responded 
that he is not concerned with what may happen in Corfu. But he 
has to be concerned, because the outcome of the meeting in Corfu 
may complicate his mission. It may even create a very 
unfavorable state of affairs. 
  Yes, we discussed all that. We reiterated the decisions that 
have been adopted and the agreements that have been reached. He 
promised us that he will inform the correspondents that the 
Turkish Cypriot side has done what it was expected to do. It 
will be recalled that he informed the world after we met last 
time that the ball was in our court. However, the ball was in 
the Greek Cypriot side's court at that time as well. We also 
underlined that Kliridhis seems to have agreed to the 
confidence-building measures because of the Greek Cypriot side's 
tactical approach. However, he will not sign an agreement, 
because the Greek Cypriot side has no need for an agreement. 
  Yes, we exchanged views. As he himself has said, he has 
observed the Turkish Cypriot side's goodwill once again. 
  Mr. Clark said that time is required to allow the problem to 
cool down. We have been accused of wasting time. However, he 
suggested that time is required because of the Greek Cypriot 
approach. We should try to find a way to resolve the problem in 
time. We responded by saying: No other way exists but to draw 
up a written agreement. An agreement has to be drawn up and 
signed. Otherwise, no agreement can be reached. Therefore, you 
should hold talks with Kliridhis. He is obliged to sign the 
agreement. That is his duty. 
  The UN documents and Kliridhis' statements refer to the 
agreement to be concluded and signed by the two leaders. Our 
people have authorized us to conclude a fair and balanced 
agreement. Nothing can be achieved in the absence of an 
agreement that will be signed by both sides. [end recording] 
  Replying to a question, President Denktas called on Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to maintain an impartial approach. He said: If 
Butrus-Ghali wishes to maintain an impartial approach and 
refrain from giving Kliridhis an opportunity to use the 30 May 
report against the Turkish Cypriot side in Corfu, then he should 
submit a report on the developments that will favor the Turkish 
Cypriot side. He still has time to do so. He can quickly draw 
up a new report.

  [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special 
representative on Cyprus, left Cyprus this afternoon. He met 
President Glavkos Kliridhis last night and Turkish Cypriot 
leader Rauf Denktas today. 
  In a statement, Clark said the agreement that was expected 
on 
the confidence-building measures has not been reached, adding 
that Denktas did not give him the draft agreement on the 
confidence-building measures his side has prepared. He denied 
reports that he conveyed any messages in any form to both sides. 
  Denktas said Clark did not give him any document or letter, 
as he had expected, because the UN secretary general succumbed, 
to use Denktas' expression, to Kliridhis' blackmail that if 
something like this happened he would submit his resignation. 
Denktas added that in his meeting with Clark, he asked why the 
United Nations has not yet prepared a supplementary report on 
the events since 31 May, which demonstrate the goodwill of the 
Turkish Cypriot side. He said that, considering the current 
facts, during his talks in Corfu Kliridhis will cite the UN 
secretary general's 31 May report, which puts the Turkish 
Cypriot side in a bad light, and will accuse it of a lack of 
political goodwill.

his trip to France satisfied. Iliadhis visited the arms systems 
exhibition Eurosatori 1994 at the invitation of his French 
counterpart, Francois Leotard. 
  Iliadhis said he contacted many manufacturing companies in 
Paris and exchanged views on various arms systems. He said his 
contacts aimed to create good relations with these companies, 
something that is necessary for maintaining the National Guard's 
operational capability at a high level. The minister added that 
the government's goal is to purchase arms systems directly from 
the manufacturing companies. 
  Answering a relevant question, the defense minister said he 
had no contacts with representatives of the SOFMA company.

<F P=106> [Report signed "est": "China's Prime Minister Li Peng Will </F>
Arrive With 270 Delegation Members"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- China's Prime Minister Li Peng and his 
wife Zhu Lin will arrive on a state visit to Austria next 
Thursday [30 June] with a delegation comprising 270 members, 
including several government members and a high-ranking economic 
delegation. This visit will "open a new chapter" in relations 
with the People's Republic of China and might have an impact 
"throughout the coming decade," Wang Yanyi, the new Chinese 
ambassador, stated at a news conference in Vienna. 
  Particularly in terms of economic cooperation, there are 
still "great opportunities," Ambassador Wang pointed out. It is 
true that the trade volume has increased since the establishment 
of official relations in 1971 by 400 million to 11.5 billion 
(1993) [currency not given], but it only accounts for about 1 
percent of overall foreign trade in both countries. Above all, 
China is interested in Austrian technology for hydroelectric 
power plants -- special Elin turbines for rivers with low water 
levels, for example. Prime Minister Li Peng (65) himself 
studied hydroelectric engineering in Moscow at the beginning of 
the 1950's and then worked in the sphere of energy, which is 
vital for China's development. 
  After political talks in Vienna, the Chinese prime minister 
will visit the Steyr-Daimler-Puch test site near St. Valentin 
and the state-owned steel works in Linz. After a visit to 
Salzburg, he will travel to Germany on Sunday. 
  If expressed "to a moderate extent," criticism regarding the 
human rights situation in China will not endanger the course of 
cooperation that has been started, the Chinese side announced. 
China is not only carrying out political reforms, but the legal 
system is also being expanded. However, China wants to balance 
reform, development, and stability. A situation like in the 
former Soviet Union or the former Yugoslavia is to be avoided.

  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has described his 
country's cooperation with Europe as a historic agreement of 
mutual benefit. The protocol of cooperation will be signed 
tomorrow. Correspondent Fotis Kafarakis reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Kafarakis] For Russia, Corfu is another 
stop in its course toward Europe. Following the signing of the 
agreement with NATO, an agreement that for many sealed the end 
of the Cold War period, the Russian Federation aims to find in 
the Europe of the Sixteen the ally who will help it get out of 
its financial deadlock. 
  [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles] 
When this agreement is completed, Russia will be given a way 
out. A new market opens up for the Russian economy and we will 
become equal partners for the mutual benefit of both sides. 
  [Kafarakis] The historic agreement provides for a reduction 
of trade taxes and opens the road for negotiations after 1998 
for the establishment of a free trade zone. It also gives a 
push to economic cooperation, exchanges of products and 
services, and political dialogue. 
  [Yeltsin, in Russian with Greek translation in subtitles] I 
am grateful to Greece, which presides over the European Union, 
for everything that has happened in the past few weeks. [end

<F P=106> [Article by "C.G.": "Bonn Does Not Want To Burden the EU </F>
Presidency With Unresolved Personnel Issues"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn, 22 Jun -- When it assumes the EU 
presidency on 1 July, Germany wants to make it clear that the 
"main orientation" of the reunited country's foreign policy will 
be directed toward European cooperation. That is what emerges 
from the goals and main points of the EU presidency that were 
approved by the cabinet in Bonn on Wednesday [22 June]. 
Speaking at the meeting, Chancellor Kohl said that he wanted 
the Germans to exercise "a normal and good presidency" over the 
next six months, one that should not seek superficial 
achievements, but continuity in cooperation with partners, 
especially with France and Spain. Foreign Minister Kinkel said 
that Germany will show that it is committed to close and 
enduring cooperation in "solidly implementing the Maastricht 
Treaty" and make a particular effort to provide the European 
Parliament with additional powers. 
  Discussing the Strasbourg EU Parliament, Kinkel drew 
attention to difficulties connected with personnel decisions. 
The European Parliament must vote on the composition of the 
future EU Commission in Brussels. According to Bonn, the most 
important question that the European Council has to answer in 
Corfu on Friday is who will succeed Delors. There is 
substantial annoyance in Bonn that Dutch Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers is conducting "an election campaign with all possible 
means" to become president of the EU Commission, despite his 
defeat in the parliamentary elections. There is particular 
irritation in Bonn about personal attacks on Kohl. It is being 
said that in the case of a secret ballot in Corfu on Friday 
evening, Belgian Prime Minister [Jean-Luc] Dehaene can count on 
a majority of 10 votes to two among the EU member states. If 
Holland does not block a decision in favor of Dehaene and Great 
Britain receives compensation in the form of another post, the 
European Council will propose a new president at the Corfu 
meeting. Great Britain is currently still promoting its 
candidate [Trade Commissioner Sir Leon] Brittan and has raised 
objections to Dehaene, saying that the Belgian is a 
"federalist." In Bonn, it is being said that Great Britain is 
considering convoking a special meeting of the European Council 
at the end of July or the beginning of September, because of a 
lack of consensus. The German EU presidency would then have to 
"conjure up" another candidate: The three current contenders -- 
Dehaene, Lubbers, and Brittan -- would have to drop out in such 
a case. That would be inconvenient for the German Government. 
Bonn sees that as making the presidency more difficult. 
[passage omitted] 
  A European Council action program for combating unemployment 
is to be launched during the German presidency, which begins 
after the meeting on Corfu, and the Federal Government wants to 
press for adherence to free market principles during its 
implementation. Kinkel and Economics Minister Rexrodt said that 
the currency union should not be postponed, but should only come 
into effect once the convergence criteria have been satisfied. 
Rexrodt announced that the German presidency would institute a 
technical procedure in Brussels for monitoring the budgetary 
situation in individual member states. Industrial policy should 
not be allowed to amount to no more than employment programs, 
but should also bolster private investment. Bonn will appoint a 
commission composed of representatives of business, science, 
public administration, and trade unions in the member countries. 
The commission should establish which central regulations can 
be done away with. The European Union should conduct a critical 
assessment of restrictions on trade with East Europe. Various 
Brussels subsidy programs should be examined "so that there 
should not be a flood of such programs, for which Germany pays 
every third German mark." Kinkel summed up Germany's intentions 
for the next six months as follows: "The German presidency will 
not make any promises that it cannot keep."

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Nahrendorf: "No Fair Play in EU </F>
Financing"] 
  [Excerpts] It is said that one does not discuss money, one 
simply has it. But Germany has not had any money since 
unification. In the European Union [EU] prosperity league, 
Germany has fallen from second place to sixth or seventh place; 
at the end of 1995 the national debt, including the debts of the 
former GDR, will have reached 2.1 trillion marks [DM]. 
Expenditures have reached the almost prohibitive level of 45 
percent of the budget. 
  We should also not be ashamed to discuss "disparities" in 
financial contributions to the EU in front of our European 
friends, many of whom deserve our thanks for their support for 
German unification and for eastern Germany's integration into 
the EU. A good friendship must also include money. The 
reduction of the high German net contribution to the EU forms 
part of the European agenda. 
  In 1993, Germany's net contribution to the EU was DM23.6 
billion. It is supposed to rise to DM25 billion this year. The 
German Bundesbank assumes that it will reach DM30 billion in 
1997. Were it not for German unification and the consequent 
reflux of EU funds, especially since 1994, Germany's payments to 
the EU would have been even greater. 
  A reduction in the German contribution can hardly be 
achieved 
by means of a mere increase in the financial reflux from 
Brussels and the application of a red pencil to EU expenses, 
most of which have already been decided upon. That would 
require an alteration to the entire system of financing the EU. 
But the government, faithful to the motto "Pacta sunt 
servanda," [agreements must be observed] does not dare try to 
make the financial principles which the EC heads of state and 
government signed in Edinburgh in 1992 and which remain valid 
until 1999 the subject of new discussions. In Edinburgh, the 
European Council merely tried to induce the European Commission 
to produce by 1999 a report on the functioning of the individual 
finance system in the EU. [passage omitted] 
  Helmut Kohl, for whom Europe unification is with good reason 
the other side of German unification, wants to achieve progress 
in the process of EU consolidation. He is handling the subject 
of EU finances with tact. In the Bundestag European debate he 
said: "It is true that we, as the economically strongest 
country, pay more to the EU than anyone else, because we have 
the greatest advantage. But it is also true that in the future, 
the concept of EU finances must be geared more strongly to per 
capita income in the individual countries. Our aim is that 
other member countries with a per capita income similar to ours 
should assume more financial responsibility than in the past." 
Helmut Kohl, duty president of the EU as of 1 July, will have 
to accept the fact that Germany's high net contribution to the 
EU is going to be a topic of the election campaign.

  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops taking part in 
a mercy mission to Rwanda crossed into the strife-torn country 
from Zaire on Thursday [23 June], government sources said. 
  Reconnaissance units from the mission codenamed Operation 
Turquoise crossed the border from Goma in Zaire to Rwanda's 
Gisenyi region at around 1330 GMT, the sources said. 
  A second group crossed the border some 100 kilometres (62 
miles) further south at Bukavu in Zaire and were heading towards 
Cyangugu in Rwanda, the sources added. 
  The second group totalled some 100 to 200 men in armoured 
vehicles and backed by helicopters, military sources said. 
  Acting under a UN mandate, they have been ordered to come to 
the assistance of some 8,000 members of the minority Tutsi 
people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the 
majority Hutu government.

  [Text] Italy is one of the countries which may take part in 
the UN mission in Rwanda. Mario De Scalzi interviewed Defense 
Minister Cesare Previti a few minutes ago. He asked him what 
the Italian Government's position is. 
  [Begin recording] [Previti] We have said we are available 
for 
an international mission -- either sponsored by the Western 
European Union [WEU] or the United Nations -- and we can confirm 
that. The mission should be very international. The commandment 
should clearly be given to someone at a supernational level [as 
heard]. The goals should be peace and humanitarian aid. 
  [De Scalzi] So a mission like the French one is not feasible 
according to you? 
  [Previti] The United Nations has given its support to the 
French intervention. It must be a short-term intervention 
before there is a wider UN intervention. I hope these plans 
materialize as soon as possible. It appears that it is more and 
more necessary to do what the prime minister has said more than 
once: There should be a task-force capable of intervening on 
behalf of the United Nations or the WEU in places like Rwanda 
where the disaster is getting worse by the minute. [end

  [Text] Four Swedish ministers this afternoon arrived on the 
Greek island of Corfu. Sweden's membership agreement with the 
European Union [EU] is going to be signed in Corfu tomorrow 
morning. This ceremony will take place before the EU starts its 
summit, where the Swedish prime minister and foreign minister 
are allowed to take part. Prime Minister Carl Bildt sees the 
Corfu meeting as important for Sweden. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] We are now taking a step toward 
European cooperation (?with this agreement). We have been 
outside European cooperation for a very long time. I hope we 
will approve this at a national referendum in November. Now for 
the first time we have the possibility of a seat and a voice, 
even though we cannot yet vote in European cooperation. This is 
a historic step. 
  [Correspondent Titti Nylander] You are going to be sitting 
among the other prime ministers as if you -- Sweden -- are a 
member, almost. Are you not going to feel slightly odd because 
we are not really members yet? 
  [Bildt] It will be the case that I will not have the 
possibility to influence any of the decisions. I do have the 
possibility to say what we think about various points, but when 
the decisions are made, then we -- Norway, Sweden, and Finland 
-- we are not taking part, we are observers. However, we think 
it is important that we join in the cooperation as soon as 
possible, and therefore we are active observers. [end recording]

ministerial portfolio. Correspondent Kostis Dhimtsas has the 
following report: 
  [Begin Dhimtsas recording] According to close associates of 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the reshuffle will take place 
within the first 10 days of July, probably on 6 July. The 
reshuffle will be selective, not wide as has been reported in 
the press. Karolos Papoulias will remain as foreign minister 
and Yerasimos Arsenis as national defense minister. Theodhoros 
Pangalos will leave the Foreign Ministry, but will remain in the 
government and assume another ministry. Pangalos expressed a 
desire to go to the Culture Ministry. As close associates of 
Papandreou said, however, the prime minister has not decided 
whether the ministers of culture and education will be replaced. 
The basic structure of the Ministry of National Economy and the 
Finance Ministry will not change, but secondary changes with the 
appointment of Dhimitrios Tsovolas and possibly Vaso Papandreou 
[former Greek commissioner at the EU] are not ruled out. 
Finally, and again according to close associates of the prime 
minister, there have been proposals to appoint deputy prime 
ministers. It appears that Papandreou has not adopted these 
proposals. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Part of the Turkish unit that will serve in the 
UN peace force in Bosnia-Herzegovina flew to Split from Ankara's 
Esenboga Airport this morning. A ceremony was held at the 
airport, and President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller were 
among those attending. 
  Staff Colonel Mehmet Ali Erdogan, commander of the unit, 
said 
in a speech at the ceremony that the Turkish peace force was 
trained to serve and survive in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
independently. He pointed out that the unit is going to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with 261 different types of vehicles, close 
to 1,300 tonnes of equipment, and, as a precautionary measure, 
additional supplies for 60 days. [passage omitted] 
  National Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said that guided by 
Ataturk's principle of "Peace at home, peace in the world," 
Turkey has always believed in the need to protect peace. He 
pointed out that during the Ottoman era, the Turkish nation made 
peace reign in the Balkans and the Middle East -- current 
sources of ethnic tension -- for hundreds of years. Golhan said 
Turkish troops carried out their duties successfully in Korea 44 
years ago and in Somalia a short while ago. 
  [Begin Golhan recording] It is a fact that the Turkish 
nation has close historical and cultural ties with the Muslims 
living in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Our heroic soldiers are going 
there now, however, to help put out the fire and prevent the 
massacres, without discriminating between ethnic origins or 
religious differences. None of the regional countries and no 
person should have any doubts about that. [end recording]

  [Text] On the subject of Rwanda, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Spain, and Germany said today that they are ready to 
give logistic or humanitarian assistance to the French 
operation. Great Britain is also reported to be ready to 
provide logistic assistance. Italy, for its part, says it is 
ready to provide support in the form of troops, but with certain 
conditions attached. The French 60-man detachment, which 
arrived yesterday afternoon in Cyangugu, in the southwest of 
Rwanda, is continuing to supply the humanitarian needs of the 
civilian population of the region this morning, while violent 
fighting continued between the government forces and the rebels 
of the Patriotic Front in the capital, Kigali. A mortar shell 
hit the operating theater of the Red Cross hospital, and sick 
people may well have been wounded. 
  The United Nations High Commission is expecting a further 
exodus of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans into neighboring 
countries, if the soldiers allow them to cross the border.

<F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Jean de la Gueriviere: </F>
"After Several Months of Talks: Russia Finally Signs 
Partnership for Peace Agreement With NATO"] 
  [Excerpts] "This is not Yalta, this is Brussels. There 
cannot be any confusion on this." Thus Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev sought to reassure a journalist from a Baltic 
state whose question reflected a suspicion that the world was 
once again being carved up after Russia's signing of the 
Partnership for Peace [PFP] framework agreement at NATO 
headquarters on Wednesday, 22 June. [passage omitted] 
  During the closing news conference, a Polish journalist 
asked 
Mr. Kozyrev whether Russia would object to Poland joining NATO. 
"As equal partners within NATO, we shall have an equal right to 
say what we think," was all the Russian minister would say, 
mentioning an upcoming meeting with his Polish counterpart to 
discuss the issue. 
  A Lithuanian journalist had an insidious question -- already 
asked by his government -- as to whether small Lithuania could 
ask for a "special relationship" with NATO as part of the PFP, 
in light of the "precedent" created with Russia. NATO Deputy 
Secretary General Sergio Balanzino, who replaced Manfred 
Woerner, still unable to attend due to health problems, did not 
leave him many illusions....

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock by </F>
Guenter Schmidt at the EU summit in Corfu on 25 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Schmidt] You said yesterday that a dream was 
beginning to come true. Considering the severe fighting for the 
succession of Delors, is this still the same dream or is the 
dream no longer that nice? 
  [Mock] This is why I said that one has to be realistic. The 
dream is a more peaceful, stronger, and more solid -- 
economically and ecologically -- Europe. Not for tomorrow; it 
is tomorrow that the work will start. Tomorrow is today. This 
will take a whole generation, and the Austrians are now part of 
it. Yes, it has been a dream. [passage as heard] 
  [Schmidt] Minister, this dream may be somewhat disturbed by 
the events in the former Yugoslavia. In the foreign ministers' 
councils and the European councils in the past few years, all 
one could hear were declarations expressing regret for what 
happened there and appeals for peace. Can you imagine anything, 
or are there plans that are more promising? 
  [Mock] I am approaching this issue with a great deal of 
realism. In Austria, we have told the people, especially also 
in the run up to the referendum, that this security structure of 
the Maastricht Treaty is necessary. After all, the European 
Community so far has not had a security structure, no joint 
foreign structure. This cannot be developed within 10 years. I 
think that if this is developed step-by-step and if, together 
with the Americans, the European Union proceeds with a somewhat 
stronger sense of realism, then the European Union will achieve 
credibility in this area, too. 
  [Schmidt] In the past few months, the Greeks introduced the 
issue of enlarging the European Union in the south through 
Cyprus and Malta. This issue was also discussed today. Do you 
see any major problems in this connection? Would such a step 
take away energy from the Eastern enlargement or can the 
European Union cope with it? 
  [Mock] For these two very small countries, I see a chance in 
1997-98. After yesterday and today, I am more convinced than 
ever that it will take a long time before other new members will 
be accepted.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with ET-1 Brussels correspondent Kostas </F>
Kekis by Kostas Yiannopoulos in Corfu--live] 
  [Excerpt] The EU [European Union] leaders luncheon has just 
ended. During the lunch the leaders would have held informal 
discussions. Kostas, do we have any information on their 
discussions? 
  [Kekis] The luncheon agenda included an evaluation of the 
results of the European Parliament elections and a discussion on 
how to deal with racism and xenophobia in the EU. Regarding the 
elections for the European Parliament and according to our 
information, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the European 
leaders should not be satisfied with the result because of the 
low voter turnout and because some parties with positions 
against the Maastricht Treaty have increased their power. 
Papandreou.... 
  [Yiannopoulos interrupts] We have a picture now of the 
meeting before the luncheon. 
  [Kekis] Papandreou's view was that the low turnout was due 
to 
problems faced by the EU, such as unemployment and the loose 
promotion of the EU's internal security in the fields of social 
protection and solidarity. According to the various 
delegations, the same positions were expressed by other leaders 
who do not appear satisfied with the result of the elections.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin has sought and was refused endorsement of the 
European Union [EU] for Russian mediation efforts in Georgia and 
other regions of the Caucasus, a French official said here 
Friday [24 June]. 
  French presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli said Yeltsin 
had 
expressed disappointment at the refusal during a dinner he 
attended with EU leaders here on Thursday ahead of a two-day EU 
summit which started on Friday. 
  After the dinner, Yeltsin said he had also been grilled 
about 
Russia's involvement in negotiating a peaceful settlement to the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Musitelli said Russia was seeking recognition of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a regional arm of 
the United Nations which could launch peacekeeping activities 
under a UN mandate. 
  Russian peacekeeping troops began deploying Friday in 
Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, where ethnic 
Abkhazians are seeking Russian support for their secessionist 
ambitions. 
  Currently, the only European organisation able to authorise 
peacekeeping activities is the pan-European Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which also includes 
the United States and Canada. 
  Musitelli quoted French President Francois Mitterrand as 
telling Yeltsin that Russia gave the impression of not always 
welcoming CSCE intervention in the Russian "near-abroad" -- 
other countries of the former Soviet Union. 
  He also quoted Yeltsin as saying that Russian influence over 
Serbia was limited. The EU leaders had pressed the Russian 
president to increase pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept a 
settlement in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Yeltsin said he remained "very involved" in efforts to 
negotiate an end to the conflict, but warned that Russia's task 
was complicated by links between Serb leaders and the Russian 
opposition. 
  Musitelli quoted Yeltsin as telling European Commission 
president Jacques Delors on Friday: "You tortured me for three 
hours last night, but it was a salutary experience."

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: The 
Greek Presidency of the European Council wants to confirm that 
the accession of Cyprus and Malta will take place during the 
next phase of the European Union's [EU] expansion. He added 
that the Republic of Cyprus already meets the nominal criteria 
of the Maastricht Treaty. Mr. Venizelos praised the statement 
of outgoing European Parliament President Egon Klepsch, who 
pointed out the need for Cyprus and Malta to be included in the 
next phase of the EU expansion within a specific time limit. 
  Mr. Venizelos further noted that at the noon meeting of the 
EU summit participants discussed the European election results, 
the French-German initiative to combat racism and xenophobia, 
and the questions pertaining to the so-called Third Pylon -- 
cooperation, internal issues, matters of justice -- that are 
provided for in the Maastricht Treaty. 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou pointed out the phenomenon 
of extreme diaspora of votes to parties that do not belong to 
the European Parliament and the fact that in our country voting 
is compulsory. The prime minister said: The low turnout of the 
European Election should give us reason to think. 
  After the Greek prime minister finished, French President 
Francois Mitterrand took the floor and referred to the 
French-German initiative to combat racism and xenophobia. The 
next speaker was British Prime Minister John Major who referred 
to the need for cooperation between the police authorities of 
the member states. In his address, European Commission 
President Jacques Delors referred to the problem of political 
indifference that was noticed during the European Election.

<F P=106> [Statement by Andreas Papandreou, Greek Prime Minister and </F>
European Council President--recorded] 
  [Text] History demands that the European Union [EU] 
assumes its responsibilities at the level of the entire 
continent. It also demands it contributes to formulating a 
political and economic order in Europe based on free consent and 
solidarity between the European nations with respect for their 
history, civilization, and traditions. The treaty for the EU is 
our answer to this challenge by history, it sets the bases and 
determines a stronger international presence by a united Europe. 
  However, the march toward European integration is a 
continuing process. We look to the future with optimism. The 
intergovernmental conference in 1996 will give us the 
opportunity to diagnose the possible weaknesses of the current 
system and to proceed with the necessary readjustments with the 
participation of our new partners. However, as a community of 
democratic countries, we cannot proceed without the support of 
our citizens. The positive result of the Austrian referendum, 
which we welcome with particular joy, constitutes a clear 
message of optimism and confidence in tomorrow's Europe. 
  On this occasion, I would like to again express our 
appreciation to the outgoing European Parliament for the spirit 
of cooperation it demonstrated and for the majority that voted 
for this expansion. I am very happy because today all of us are 
given the opportunity to meet here to formally seal a successful 
outcome to an official negotiation that lasted for one year and 
for which important efforts were made by 16 European states and 
by the European Commission. 
  As president of the European Council, I am proud of the 
successful outcome of these negotiations during the Greek 
Presidency. I congratulate you and welcome you to the ranks of 
the EU.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
leaders meeting here Friday [24 June] agreed the outlines of a 
common economic policy, an essential step if they are to bring 
their economies towards greater union, diplomatic sources said. 
  The talks on price stability, sound public finances and 
labour market flexibility were brief, the main points having 
already been approved at a meeting of the EU member's ministers 
of economy and finance two weeks ago. 
  They had to be approved by the heads of government at the EU 
summit here before being formally adopted by the finance and 
economics ministers at their next meeting. 
  Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen told European leaders 
that the union had to offer a clearer explanation to the public 
indicating that the policy was aimed at fighting unemployment, 
the source said. 
  The convergence criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty on 
European economic and political union set a limit for public 
sector debt of 3 percent of gross domestic product. 
  The criteria have to be met for countries to join a single 
European currency sector due to be agreed at the end of 1997 or 
1999. Few EU member states currently meet the targets.

<F P=106> [By Peter Cunliffe-Jones] </F>
  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- An argument over the 
job of the Europe's top civil servant pushed the subject of 
Europe's 20 million unemployed down the European Union [EU] 
summit's agenda here Friday [24 June]. 
  Diplomats and politicians engaged in intense backroom 
wrangling over the succession to French Socialist Jacques Delors 
as President of the European Commission. Gathering in huddles, 
journalists talked of little else. 
  "Sometimes, the interests of the media and the interests of 
political people do meet," Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen 
told reporters here. 
  "I'm afraid that today they don't. And I'd rather prefer if 
we talk about unemployment or how to make concrete means 
available to ordinary people." 
  The economy was the main topic of discussion at the 
afternoon 
session of talks between EU leaders, British officials stressed 
Friday. 
  "And we have talked about unemployment many times in the 
past." 
  The discussions among leaders and finance ministers 
concentrated on four main topics, the British 
said. 

  -  Macroeconomic policy, covering price stability, sound 
public finances and labour market flexibility. 
  -  A report by 
European Commissioner Martin Bangemann on liberalisation of the 
markets, particularly in telecommunications. 
  -  Discussion of ways 
to implement the European Commission's Trans European Networks 
proposals, covering 11 road, rail and telecommunications 
projects across Europe. 
  -  And a German proposal to set up a task 
force on deregulation, tackling the "difficulties of creating 
jobs in Europe, and for small- and medium-sized businesses." 

  The projects for Trans European Networks formed a key 
element 
in Delors' white paper on unemployment, issued last year, which 
set out a massive investment programme for the community. 
  At a Brussels press conference earlier this week, Delors was 
critical of "two or perhaps three EU countries," which have 
blocked his plan for significant public sector involvement in 
funding the projects. 
  This was a reference to Britain, France and Germany, which 
do 
not want to raise their public debt in order to pay for an 
ambitious multimillion dollar investment programme for 
transport, energy and telecom networks. 
  Delors said he feared that EU leaders might ditch a 
Commission proposal for measures to increase competitiveness and 
create jobs, because of signs that their countries were emerging 
economic recession. 
  Even annual economic growth of 2.5 or three percent was not 
enough to bring down unemployment which is expected to peak at 
11.6 percent in 1995 -- meaning nearly 20 million people will be 
out of work, he said. 
  Officials close to Delors admit that the Commission's plans 
-- to pay for the investment programme and to reduce social 
charges levied to pay for social programmes and raise the money 
through a new energy tax -- have been largely gutted. 
  Of the 11 projects which were expected to be approved at the 
summit, many have already been all but decided, and they 
represent just a small slice of Delors' original plans, 
Commission officials said. 
  "Unemployment has not been dropped from the summit. It is 
just that the ideas coming to the fore are of a different 
political complexion than those that were previously in the 
front," a source close to the Commission said.

<F P=106> [George Jones, Christopher Lockwood report: "Major Proposes </F>
EC War on Crime"] 
  [Text] Corfu--A Europe-wide crusade against drugs, 
international crime and fraud was urged by Mr John Major at 
yesterday's opening session of the EC summit. 
  He called on fellow European leaders to approve a five-point 
plan to combat crime within the EC and foreshadowed plans for a 
new drive against drugs in British schools this autumn. It 
would be aimed at changing youth culture and reducing the 
availability and acceptability of drugs. 
  Mr Major said tackling rising crime would be one way in 
which 
the EC could demonstrate that it was addressing the issues which 
affected its citizens. He said the low turn-out in the 
elections to the European Parliament earlier this month had 
shown there was widespread apathy towards the EC. 
  "People aren't at the roadside cheering it on. Many don't 
see it as being relevant in their lives. We must bring European 
policies closer to the people." 
  Quoting what he described as "sobering statistIcs," Mr Major 
said that enough cocaine had been seized in the EC so far this 
year to provide 24 million individual doses. The drugs were 
worth an estimated 840 billion pounds. 
  He said the British Government would be publishing a new 
national drugs strategy in the autumn. One of its main 
objectives would be to counter drug abuse in schools and look at 
the link between drug use and crime. 
  Europe needed a clear action plan across the Community to 
tackle drug trafficking and protect young people. 
  It must also combat fraud against the EC, which amounted to 
robbing the taxpayers of huge sums. A recent investigation had 
uncovered fraudulent claims of more than 65 million pounds for 
nonexistent stocks of wheat. All 12 EC countries needed 
effective national laws against fraud, which should be made 
"criminal, imprisonable and extraditable." 
  Mr Major said the summit should agree to: 
  All EC countries ratifying by October a convention setting 
up 
Europol, the basis of a Europe-wide police force dealing with 
drugs, organised crime and fraud. It would be based in The 
Hague. 
  Europol's powers should be wide, to include an attack on 
organised crime. 
  The countries of central and eastern Europe should be 
involved in joint measures against crime. 
  The German government, which takes over the EC presidency on 
July 1, should call a conference on drugs and organised crime. 
  The EC should reach agreement on national criminal laws 
against fraud by the end of this year. 
  Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured Mr Major that one of the 
priorities of the German presidency would be combating drugs. 
  Earlier, the EC leaders and Mr Boris Yeltsin signed a 
partnership and co-operation agreement paving the way for closer 
trading links between Russia and the Community. 
  This, the first such deal Russia has signed with any of its 
trading partners, came two days after it agreed to a Partnership 
for Peace deal with NATO. 
  Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Trade Commissioner, described the 
latest agreement as a "quantum leap" in Russia's relationship 
with Europe. 
  Leaders of the four countries which have agreed to join the 
EC next year -- Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway -- signed 
the formal Instrument of Accession, which admits them to the 
Community. Austria has endorsed that decision in a referendum, 
but the other three still have to win the backing of their 
people.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias raised the 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue 
last night at the working dinner of the European Union [EU] 
foreign ministers, which was held at the same time as the dinner 
of the European Council. The issue was raised within the 
framework of discussions of joint foreign policy, particularly 
during the discussion of the Yugoslav issue, which was also 
attended by UN mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
  Mr. Papoulias referred to the open Vance initiative, the 
Greek positions, and to the Commission's court appeal against 
Greece. 
  The Foreign Ministers Council will continue its work today 
and will discuss the prospects of Cyprus' accession to the EU. 
Another issue to be discussed is cooperation among the 
Mediterranean, Central European, and East European countries.

<F P=106> [By Peter Cunliffe-Jones] </F>
  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
leaders, meeting in Corfu, Saturday [25 June] endorsed a 
programme of major trans-continental public works to boost jobs 
and competitiveness in Europe. 
  The programme comprises 11 major road and rail links 
including access to the Channel tunnel train between Paris, 
Brussels and London, plus the Brenner axis linking Verona with 
Berlin, and the Oeresund rail-road link between Denmark and 
Sweden. 
  The other projects, all of which are to be started "by 1996 
at the latest," are based in Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. 
  The 11 works programmes will cost an estimated ECU68.5 
billion (81.5 billion dollars) by 2010. A final decision on the 
financing was put off until the next full EU summit in six 
months time. 
  The 12 European leaders, closing a two-day EU summit 
Saturday, also reconfirmed their commitment to the European 
Commission's white paper on employment and competitivity which 
they adopted in December. 
  "The improvement in the economic situation (in Europe) 
should 
not lead to a slackening of efforts to promote structural 
adjustment in Europe...particularly in the field of employment," 
they said, in a final summit statement. 
  Reforms set out in the white paper included plans to boost 
labour market flexibility, making it easier for employers to 
hire and fire, and increase training. 
  However, there was no action on a Commission proposal to 
switch the cost of Europe's social benefits from charges on 
businesses to an antipollution energy tax. 
  The European Council "takes note of the progress on the 
CO[.sub]2[/]/Energy tax issues, underlining the need to 
ensure that environmental costs are better reflected throughout 
the economy," the statement said. 
  The EU's 11 transport projects represent the first slice of 
a 
multi-billion dollar scheme to span the EU with transport, 
telecommunications and energy networks stretching eventually 
into East Europe. 
  They are intended to increase the efficiency of the single 
market, make businesses more efficient and create better and 
safer communications in general. 
  The EU leaders agreed to continue work on extending the 
transport links into "neighbouring countries, in particular to 
Central and East European countries and to the Mediterranean 
basin." 
  And they urged continuing work on preparing eight major 
projects in the energy sector, but refused to give them a green 
light. 
  Britain had urged holding back on final approval for the 
transport projects until their financing had been agreed. 
  The summit statement stressed that unspecified "measures 
will 
be taken -- if proved necessary -- to ensure that priority 
projects do not run into financial obstacles which would 
jeopardize their implementation." 
  The summit accepted European Commission President Jacques 
Delors' proposal for "round tables" of experts to speed up the 
action on the transport projects. 
  They also agreed on his proposal for a minister in each EU 
member country to coordinate on the setting up of information 
super-highways linking the member states. 
  On Friday, the 12 agreed the outlines of a common economic 
policy vital if they are to bring their economies towards 
greater union. 
  Talks on the agreed themes of price stability, sound public 
finances and labour market flexibility were brief, the main 
points having already been approved at a meeting of the EU 
member's ministers of economy and finance two weeks ago, 
diplomatic sources said.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] has pledged ECU500 million (575 million dollars) towards 
shutting down Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the 
world's worst civilian nuclear accident, French President 
Francois Mitterrand said Saturday [25 June]. 
  Speaking after the two-day summit ended here, he said the 
12-member European Union would seek more funding for this 
purpose from other industrialized countries at the Group of 
Seven summit in Naples, Italy, next month. 
  The sum pledged by the EU includes a loan of ECU400 million 
and a gift of ECU100 million. 
  The summiteers agreed during the two-day meeting on the 
necessity of closing down Ukraine's dangerous Chernobyl nuclear 
reactor. Britain, France, Germany and Italy said they would 
press for an agreement on the financing of the shutdown at the 
G7 summit. 
  It is a "very important area," Mitterrand said, adding that 
the EU plan for shutting down Chernobyl included "overall reform 
of the energy sector" in the former Soviet republic of the 
Ukraine. 
  Before the EU summit, France and Germany sent a joint letter 
to their partners stressing the urgency of a quick and total 
shutdown of the entire Chernobyl complex, where the April 1986 
nuclear disaster was caused by an explosion in one of its 
reactors.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] 
leaders Saturday [25 June] condemned "terrorism" in Algeria and 
urged the "rigorous pursuit of the national dialogue and the 
process of structural reform" there. 
  Closing a two-day summit of EU leaders here, the 12 EU 
nations said they were following the situation in Algeria 
closely and "condemn all acts of terrorism and violations of 
human rights, both against Algerians and foreign citizens." 
  Dozens of foreigners have been killed in Algeria in the past 
two years since fighting began between Islamic fundamentalists 
and a military backed regime. 
  The EU leaders said in a statement the pursuit of reform was 
"essential for the liberalization of the Algerian economy and 
its better integration into the world economy." 
  They also invited EU finance ministers to urgently examine a 
proposed European Commission ECU200 million (240 million dollar) 
loan to Algeria.

<F P=106> [Statement by European Union [EU] Commissioner Jacques </F>
Delors at Corfu news conference at the end of EU Summit--live in 
French with simultaneous translation into Greek] 
  [Text] Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In order not 
to speak too long, I will start by saying that it is impossible 
for me to give you a full account of the Greek Presidency. 
Although the text that you see is a 16-page text, 16 pages that 
prove the successes of the Greek Presidency as against what we 
have read here and there and which I did not like at all because 
they are contrary to the truth. 
  It is enough to remember that the Greek Presidency quickly 
managed to conclude negotiations with four new countries in the 
European Union's expansion. It also held negotiations that 
resulted in the signing of a partnership relationship with 
Russia and Ukraine, although in December 1993 we also 
established that there were great difficulties in concluding the 
agreement with Russia. The Greek Presidency also successfully 
entered the second phase of the economic and monetary union, and 
on a number of other issues many great and successful steps were 
made. For this, I would like to thank European Council 
President Mr. Papandreou, as well as [Greek Deputy Foreign 
Minister] Mr. Theodhoros Pangalos, [Greek National Economy 
Minister] Mr. Ioannis Papandoniou, and all the Greek Government 
ministers who contributed to this great success. 
  I say all this because if this council is marked by the fact 
that no new president of the European Community Commission has 
been named, the blame certainly does not lie with the Greek 
Presidency which made every possible effort to find a solution. 
All this because one country exercised its right of veto, which 
every member state has, against the candidate who was preferred 
by the other 11 member states. 
  First, with regard to assessing the future of Europe, the 
Greek Presidency made every possible effort, and, I will add, 
that we can say the Brussels message [words indistinct] that the 
white paper remains a framework for the development and future 
of the member states, it constitutes a live and dynamic 
framework. During the course of my work, I have recorded the 
progress made at the national and Community level in 
strengthening the European competitiveness, to find a model for 
development, something richer with regard to employment, a 
framework of thought in order to change the manner of 
development so that there will be more employment without 
changing the philosophy of our European communities. 
  Second, in the conclusions of the European Council you will 
find all those elements that will allow us to continue this work 
at both national and European levels. On a European level I 
particularly note the pledge concerning the list of priorities 
for the big infrastructure projects, and continuation of the 
works regarding the big networks of energy and other big 
infrastructure networks. Also the general ideas and 
orientations concerning the society of information and 
establishment of the decisionmaking procedures--with one 
minister in charge of coordinating these in every member state. 
These will express a joint decision and will allow us to 
continue a social, developing, and functional task because the 
appearance of these information networks will also change the 
organization of work and the organization of our societies. 
  Third, we attach a high a priority to the small- and 
medium-size businesses. Here we have the jurisdiction of the 
national, regional, and local authorities, but at a 
Community-level we have a program of social initiatives 
supplementing those orientations that would facilitate the 
strengthening of all these businessmen, of all these small and 
medium businesses that create employment. Concerning the 
employment systems, the Commission's orientations have been 
accepted, [words indistinct] for equal opportunities and to give 
everyone the chance to adjust technological changes. We need a 
change of employment systems so we can facilitate finding people 
employment or vocational training, giving priority to the 
youths; every youth who graduates from school should not be 
unemployed, instead we should give him a job, we should offer 
either training or work. We should also formulate the working 
time so as to exploit the technological development, we should 
attach particular importance to options for the use of time, and 
finally to formulate a means of development that would include 
the protection of environment, options for the use of time, 
development of the countryside, and formulation of [words 
indistinct] in such a manner that we may respond in the best way 
possible to both the new needs of society and the creation of 
new employment positions as well as to the distribution of the 
fruits of development by assigning every priority to employment. 
This is the new concept of solidarity in Europe between those 
who have and those who do not have a job. This is best for the 
future because if by the end of the century we have the same 
current unemployment levels, then the repercussions on a 
political and social level in Europe will be terrible. 
  The white paper lives and the European Council, I believe, 
will devote to the white paper many six-month periods and many 
presidencies. Those works will allow us to reach the means to 
formulate this new world at its birth. 
  We have also determined a series of text with regard to 
foreign policy. We have prepared the summit conference of the 
industrialized countries so that there may be a strengthening of 
the efforts by the industrialized countries with regard to 
nuclear safety in order to appease public opinion. We do not 
have to face the negative consequences from the bad operation of 
certain nuclear units. This program also includes closing down 
the Chernobyl unit by giving to Ukraine the necessary means to 
cope with its energy needs. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen this is all I can say today about the 
European Council. I repeat my thanks to President Mr. 
Papandreou.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at Corfu </F>
news conference at the end of the European Union [EU] summit at 
the Municipal Theater in Corfu--live] 
  [Text] I warmly thank European Commission President Jacques 
Delors for his kind words about the Greek Presidency. This 
European Union summit was actually very significant. Delors has 
already given us a taste of what we managed to accomplish, what 
we have managed to agree upon, and what we have managed to do. 
I believe these are great steps forward. 
  Before going into detail, I would like to say that although 
some disagree about the general policy that is being formulated, 
this policy is contained in Delors' white paper. Battles have 
been waged to achieve this, but now it is established. The 
white paper will constitute a guide for our actions and 
initiatives in the future. 
  Now, regarding decisions specifically for Greece. Four big 
development projects for our country are included in the 
decisions of the EU summit. These are the Egnatia highway 
project, the Patrai-Bulgarian border highway project, the 
natural gas network, and the cable link between Greece and 
Italy. A second point that I would like to stress is that for 
the first time it has been decided to include both Cyprus and 
Malta in the next EU expansion phase. 
  Within the framework of this conference, we had other very 
important developments. We had the signing of the agreement 
between United Europe and Russia, which constitutes a great step 
forward for peace, progress, and democracy. We also had the 
signing of the accession agreements by four countries. All of 
these countries are particularly sensitive to social policy and 
environmental issues and will contribute significantly to the 
United Europe's working level. 
  There was also an official meeting within the framework of 
dialogue between Cyprus and the European Union. As you may 
know, we met Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis on this matter. 
  I will say that I am mostly happy with the results, with 
only 
one exception, on which I cannot remain silent. We were unable 
to elect a new European Commission president to replace Jacques 
Delors. The Greek Presidency did everything possible to reach 
this goal, but unfortunately we did not achieve it. I am 
obliged to say that it was not achieved because Great Britain 
refused to accept the proposal of all the others. The issue 
remains open. A new EU summit supposedly will take place in 
mid-July to elect a new European Commission president. I do not 
want to go into more detail, but it is necessary to take a 
position. 
  Now, I ask Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos to 
detail the conclusions of this EU summit.

<F P=106> [Statement by Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros </F>
Pangalos at Corfu news conference at the end of the EU summit at 
the Municipal Theater in Corfu--live] 
  [Text] If you will allow me, Mr. Prime Minister, I will 
summarize rather than repeat what you and European Commission 
President Jacques Delors mentioned concerning the white paper. 
I believe it has been agreed to give a new push to all the 
important issues that were noted by the Greek Presidency and 
were included in the agenda. This concerns unemployment, as a 
main problem of the European economy, particularly unemployment 
of the youth and long-term unemployment. This concerns small- 
and medium-sized businesses and their capability to incorporate 
modern technology, contribute in the labor sector, and encourage 
local development activities. 
  As you know, we have adopted the 11 projects of the 
transportation sector in order of priority. These include the 
Egnatia highway and the Patrai-Athens-Thessaloniki highway that 
are especially important for our country. 
  Finally, we agreed with promoting a society of information, 
with new possibilities that open up due to the importation of 
modern telecommunications technology, development, employment, 
and improved quality of life. 
  Regarding the EU prospects, a group has been formed to 
prepare the intergovernment conference of 1996. As you know 
this was a Greek proposal. Because of this proposal, a 
compromise has been achieved in Ioannina that made the EU 
expansion possible for four new countries. The group will begin 
its work on 2 June 1995. This is the day that the Mersin 
conference convened. This way, we ratify our old position about 
a new Mersin. We have proposed this in our previous 
presidential term. Spain--which will hold the EU presidency 
during that period--will preside over the conference. The 
conference will also include--this was another goal of the Greek 
Presidency that was accepted by all Council members with a 
promise to the European Parliament--two representatives of the 
European Parliament who will participate in the group. 
  We agreed in taking action in the domestic and justice 
sectors against racism and fear of foreigners. There is a 
specific action plan. We also agreed to combat crime and drugs. 
Finally, we have adopted a text for the countries that are 
possible EU members. On Cyprus we went a step forward, 
stressing that the next EU expansion phase will include both 
Cyprus and Malta. It is the first time that Cyprus and Malta 
are included in the overall expansion chapter and their fate is 
linked to the expansion course. The expression on Cyprus 
disengages the accession course from the Cyprus issue. Of 
course there is a separate reference on this. 
  Finally, I would like to mention as briefly as possible the 
decisions made on EU foreign policy. We agreed to develop our 
relations with the Mediterranean countries, and we will examine 
the possibility of convening a conference between the EU and the 
Mediterranean countries. This is a significant push to the EU's 
Mediterranean policy. 
  We will also continue the efforts for peace in the Middle 
East, particularly reinforcing the Palestinian entities in the 
occupied Israeli areas. We call upon the Commission to make as 
many proposals as possible for agreements with East and West 
European countries and the Baltic states. We asked Russia to 
withdraw its troops by 31 August, and we asked Latvia to 
reconsider its immigration law in a way that it will not create 
problems in the protection of human rights. We intend to 
promote the decisions that we have made within the framework of 
the stability treaty, which followed the Paris Conference on 
Security and Stability. 
  We condemn the genocide in Rwanda and preannounce that we 
will take action to protect the country's population. Regarding 
South Africa, we will continue our work to restore economic and 
political relations with the entire region, particularly the new 
South African Republic where a regime of freedom and personal 
rights exists. 
  Regarding Ukraine, we decided specifically on the amounts 
that we intend to contribute to permanently close the Chernobyl 
nuclear reactor. We expressed our concern for North Korea's 
policy and we asked this country to respond to its obligations. 
We have expressed our satisfaction for the democratization 
developments and the protection of human rights that have been 
noted recently in Latin America. 
  We have adopted guidelines for joint activity in the 1995 
conference for the renewal of the nondistribution of nuclear 
weapons agreement. Therefore, the community will undertake an 
activity--something that it did not have--on the nondistribution 
of nuclear weapons. This is a new chapter. Finally, we called 
upon all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina to show political will to 
resolve the problem and ratify as soon as possible the statement 
of intention so that the European Union may take control of 
Mostar. We also intend to contribute to the reconstruction of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as conditions allow it.

<F P=106> [New conference by European Commission President Jacques </F>
Delors and Andreas Papandreou, Greek prime minister and European 
Union president, with foreign and domestic correspondents at the 
Municipal Theater in Corfu--live; Delors speaks in French with 
simultaneous translation into Greek] 
  [Excerpts] [Karelias] Yeoryios Karelias, from the newspaper 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Mr. Delors, during the period when Greece held 
the European Union [EU] Presidency it was criticized, not only 
by the press, that it was taking advantage of the presidency to 
promote a serious, national issue. I am referring to the issue 
of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. 
However, Greece never reached the point of sabotaging a serious 
EU decision. During the past two days in Corfu we have seen that 
at least one country was led to the point of sabotaging the 
election of your successor to the Commission for clearly 
domestic reasons. How do you comment? I would also like the 
prime minister to comment on this. 
  [Delors] The only thing we can say about the incidents 
regarding the election of a new European Commission president is 
that this is not just an issue about a person. It is also an 
issue of ruling out people according to intentions about 
Europe's construction. This is why this crisis is important. 
  [Papandreou] I would like to add that Mr. Leon Brittan 
resigned from running for the position. Therefore, the British 
insistence not to accept the proposal of the others was possibly 
due to a completely different perception of the meaning of a 
United Europe and of the obligations of being a member. Is this 
a satisfactory answer, Mr. Karelias? 
  [Correspondent] (Kimgeton) Sky News, London. A question for 
President Delors and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. Could 
you answer in English for the national television? What do you 
think is the message stemming from failing to elect a European 
Commission president? What is the message regarding democratic 
procedures, the message that we sent to the rest of the world? 
Will new candidates emerge before 15 July? 
  [Delors] From my point of view it is better not to add any 
comment right now because the German presidency will take over 
the weight of finding a solution, an agreement. If we enter a 
battle on this issue we will redefine the achievement of the 
German Presidency. Excuse me, but I think that right now it is 
in the European Union's interest not to add any comment on the 
current answer. 
  [Papandreou] I would like to answer the question myself. We 
proposed that we follow--and we did follow--a very democratic 
procedure. Every member state proposed a ranking of the three 
candidates. The numerical superiority of Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene came out democratically. Following that, 
everybody but Britain supported Dehaene. So, we followed a 
democratic procedure but Great Britain literally vetoed this 
procedure and did not accept this decision. I have to say that 
I do not know what Great Britain will know in two or three 
weeks, when the next meeting is held, that it does not know now. 
This is a problem because I believe the rest of us will 
continue to support Dehaene's candidacy. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] For Mr. Delors first. During 
the news conference held in Zappion Palace in January 1994, you 
stressed the need to maintain a family-spirit climate, as you 
said, regarding relations among the partners. Do you believe 
that Greece's reference to the European Court is a gesture 
within this framework? 
  The question for the Greek Prime Minister concerns Cyprus' 
application for EU membership. What is the difference between 
the reference in the conclusions of today's summit and the 
respective reference in the conclusions of the Copenhagen summit? 
  [Delors] Madame, I believe there is a political dimension in 
your question on which I have never expressed any view. There 
is also a legal dimension. The foreign ministers reminded us 
that the European Commission is a trustee of conditions. This 
means that the issue should have been referred to the European 
Court where Greece presented its arguments. Not implementing 
the treaty would have been a political decision. We have 
specific jurisdiction and duties that are attributed to us by 
the treaties. We have the authority and the monopoly, I would 
say, of submitting proposals. We must implement the decisions 
of the European Council, and we are trustees of the conditions 
within the framework of our jurisdiction. This is the job we 
are doing. It was unpleasant but we did it. 
  [Papandreou] Mr. Pangalos will reply to the question on 
Cyprus. 
  [Pangalos] I do not suppose you have in your hands the text 
of the conclusions, because if you did you would have seen the 
difference. First of all, Cyprus is now included in the 
candidate states chapter. It is not a separate Cyprus issue 
with all of its extensions, but it is contained in the candidate 
states chapter, that is the expansion. There are two important 
references to the development of relations with Cyprus. It is 
noted that both sides of these relations, the trade-technical 
aspect and the financial aspect, fall within the prospect of 
accession. Finally, there is an explicit commitment that Cyprus 
and Malta will be included in the next expansion. The reference 
also mentions Hungary and Poland. Regarding Turkey, the European 
Council characteristically notes only the convening of a 
meeting--which would happen anyway--that will deal with 
concluding the customs union agreement. I recall that the 
European Union pursues the customs union agreement, but the 
Turkish side is in no position to conclude it. I believe this 
is a significant development and I believe that I have answered 
your question, which was without reason. 
  [Correspondent] [name indistinct] representing the Yugoslav 
News Agency. A question for Prime Minister Papandreou. Mr. 
President, after six months of a very successful presidency 
during which you pointed out many times the urgent need for 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, do you believe that a just solution 
will be found soon and, if so, when? Also, what are the details 
of the peace plan that you have been discussing at the EU summit 
regarding the policy of the contact group that is playing a very 
crucial role but we know nothing about? 
  [Papandreou] I will ask Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
to 
answer the question. 
  [Papoulias] The EU effort for finding a just and permanent 
solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina was continuous, and the EU peace 
plan still guides the EU efforts toward a solution. I believe 
the contact group continues its work and thoughts are being 
discussed about a second Geneva meeting. The visit of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian foreign minister 
provided the opportunity for meetings for a better preparation 
of a second Geneva meeting. The discussion we had on Friday 
night [24 June] at the working dinner--international mediators 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were present--gave us 
adequate hope that the contact group's efforts will have a 
positive outcome in the next few weeks and that a more general 
solution, especially on the territorial problem, will be found. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] President Delors, do you rule 
out the possibility that we will have the pleasure of seeing you 
in the same position for the next five years? And how do you 
believe the four new countries will mainly affect the European 
Union's course? 
  [Delors] Regarding your first question, I rule out such a 
possibility. On the second question, despite Papandreou's 
efforts and the fact that we must realize that the four 
candidates are fully respected by him and me, I would have 
preferred that during their first EU summit, the four new member 
states not attend discussions on the election of my successor. 
I was particularly happy with the reaction on the white paper 
because we ascertained that these are countries with economic 
and social democracy, which are firmly connected to the 
political democracy. These are countries that really attribute 
particular significance in finding a new development model. 
These are countries that have made superb experiments about 
managing the labor market and devoted two or three times more 
means--human and financial--than we did. Therefore, they are 
countries that agreed on all issues that are contained in the 
white paper. This really pleased us because the presence of the 
four countries enriches us in the fight against unemployment and 
the promotion of the community's social and environmental 
dimension. 
  [Evstathiadhis] Evstathiadhis from the newspaper VIMA. A 
question for Prime Minister Papandreou. It has been 
determined--you have also said it in writing--that the EU people 
did not show great interest in the idea of a union. This has 
also been proven in the recent European Parliament election. In 
your opinion, what is the message that the Corfu summit gives to 
the European people on how to become more active in favor of the 
United Europe's ideas and realities? 
  [Papandreou] Undoubtedly, the latest European Parliament 
elections proved that the European people are only slightly 
interested in the course of a United Europe. This is a 
phenomenon that must be examined. However, we can add the 
following: With the passage of time and the escalating role of 
the European Parliament and given that many of the national 
decisions will be dictated by our capacity as members of the 
United Europe, I believe that this course will be overturned. I 
have no fuller explanation. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] My question is for both Mr. 
Delors and Mr. Papandreou. Europe very much wants to be a 
single family. Within the framework of the EU summit, did you 
discuss the issue of the Greek border and FYROM [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and the Greek embargo against it? 
  [Delors] No, we did not discuss this issue but having 
presided at the dinner of the European Union Foreign Ministers, 
Mr. Papoulias could tell you something more. 
  [Papoulias] Indeed, at the EU Foreign Ministers meeting I 
briefed my colleagues on the contacts between the Greek 
Government, mine personally, with UN mediator Cyrus Vance. You 
are aware that I will be in New York in a few days to meet Vance 
and U.S. Presidential Envoy Matthew Nimetz in an effort to find 
a solution to this problem. 
  [Pelekis] Nikolaos Pelekis from FLASH radio. Mr. President 
and Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask whether Britain's 
decision not to consent with the unanimous election for Delors' 
successor, sets in motion a serious crisis within the European 
Union and what could this mean for EU's unity? How serious is 
the crisis? 
  [Papandreou] Right now it is difficult for someone to 
evaluate this. If such a stance is maintained, then we would be 
able to speak about a crisis. Today was an unfortunate event 
that somewhat stained the overall work of the EU summit, which 
was excellent. If it continues, then it would mean something 
deeper. I do not want to predict a big crisis right now. I do 
not want to make predictions. Thank you.

  [Text] The European leaders will resume consultations at 
1000 [0700 GMT] today in Corfu on the appointment of a new 
Commission president. The [Greek] Government spokesman stressed 
that the Greek Presidency will exhaust all efforts for Jacques 
Delors' successor to be appointed today. 
  At last night's working dinner in Akhillion Palace and 
during 
the second unscheduled supplementary meeting, the 12 European 
state leaders were leaning toward Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- Dutch Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers and British EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan 
have withdrawn from the race to become European Commission 
president, diplomats said here Saturday [25 June]. 
  The only remaining official candidate for the post is 
Belgian 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but Britain is maintaining its 
veto on his candidacy, the diplomats added. 
  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino announced Lubber's 
withdrawal on the second day of a two-day EU summit. 
  He said the decision made it probable that Dehaene would 
replace Jacques Delors as head of the EU executive on January 5 
next year.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] According to sources at the 
12 states summit, which ends in Corfu today, the EU state and 
government leaders failed today to agree on the new Commission 
president to succeed Jacques Delors. The same sources also 
noted that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that his country, 
which will take over the EU Presidency on 1 July, would like to 
convene an extraordinary summit on 15 July to settle the issue. 
The deadlock in appointing Jacques Delors' successor is caused 
by Britain's opposition to the candidacy of Belgian Prime 
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. British Foreign Secretary said that 
the names of other candidates will also be discussed. Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Commissioner on Trade 
Affairs Sir Leon Brittan have withdrawn from the race for the 
Commission presidency. 
  The Greek presidency expressed its displeasure at Britain's 
stand toward the Belgian prime minister's candidacy. Government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that Greece does not see what 
can change by 15 July when the next extraordinary EU summit will 
convene. He added: The Greek presidency proposed the renewal 
of Jacques Delors term of office. 
  Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Petros 
Petridhis reports that the Greek proposal is being explored and 
that Mr. Venizelos did not give any further details on the 
proposal. At any rate, Mr. Delors' consent will be needed for 
the proposal to be realized.

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 25 (AFP) -- Outgoing European 
Commission president Jacques Delors on Saturday [25 June] ruled 
out another term as the European Union's top civil servant. 
  Delors, whose third term ends on January 5, had been asked 
by 
Greece to stay on if the 12-nation European Union failed to 
agree on a successor at their summit meeting here. 
  "I would have preferred for the four new members not to have 
to witness the sorry sight of my successor's designation," said 
Delors. 
  He said Europe was in a "serious" crisis. 
  Delors has headed the European Union's Executive Commission 
since 1984.

  [Text] Corfu, June 25 (AFP) -- European Union [EU] leaders 
on Saturday [25 June] failed to reach agreement on a new EU 
Commission president and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed 
an emergency summit to decide the matter next month, EU sources 
said. 
  The sources said Kohl had proposed a new summit on July 15. 
  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said nomination of 
the sole remaining candidate in the race, Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene, had been blocked by Britain. 
  He was speaking on the second day of a two-day EU summit 
which was dominated by a quarrel over a replacement for 
Commission President Jacques Delors, who retires on January 5 as 
the EU's top civil servant. 
  Earlier Saturday, the two other official candidates, Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and the EU's British trade 
commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, withdrew their names from the 
race. 
  Martino told journalists that Major was blocking Dehaene's 
nomination on the grounds that it had not been properly handled. 
Expressing support for the British position, he said: "Someone 
should remind us of important principles." 
  All 12 EU leaders must be in agreement for a candidacy to go 
forward to the European Parliament for its approval.

<F P=106> [Statement by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in </F>
Corfu; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The European Union summit in Corfu has ended in 
a major crisis. [passage omitted] Jean-Luc Dehaene made a 
statement after the Corfu summit. He remains a candidate and 
(?takes note of) the British veto. Here is his statement 
recorded by our special correspondent in Corfu: 
  [Begin Dehaene recording] I can see that Great Britain 
opposed my election, not for personal or national reasons, but 
for reasons of principles. In order not to make the work of the 
German presidency more difficult, I will not make any more 
statements about the issue of the presidency until the German 
presidency organizes the special summit. 
  I am disappointed for Europe today. However, I am calm about 
the whole situation. Indeed, I did not put myself up as a 
candidate. At the request of some colleagues, I was and I remain 
available, if necessary, if a consensus is reached. However, I 
am not desperate. As I have said on several occasions over the 
last few days, the results of the European elections in Belgium, 
and especially in Flanders, have reinforced my desire as prime 
minister to achieve all of the government's program. I am 
convinced that it will transpire at the end of my mandate that I 
will get the support of voters to devote myself and commit 
myself to many more years at the service of Belgium and Europe.

  [Excerpt] As you know, Jean-Luc Dehaene returned from Corfu 
having failed in his bid to succeeded Jacques Delors as director 
of the European Commission. One no vote threw everything in the 
air again, the no vote having come from the very isolated 
British. The dossier will doubtless be reopened 15 July at 
another summit in Brussels. Meanwhile Jean-Luc Dehaene is not 
withdrawing. We (?highlight) this comment: As a person, I have 
no problem with John Major. I am not blind to his position in 
Great Britain. I am even sorry for him. These are a few of the 
things said by Jean-Luc Dehaene on television at lunchtime today 
in Mises au Point. Anyway, as far as he is concerned all of 
this is not good for Europe: 
  [Begin recording] [Dehaene] Europe has in fact been blocked 
by Great Britain. That itself is not good for Europe. What is 
worse is that Europe has in fact been blocked for British 
domestic reasons, namely Major's weak position in the 
Conservative Party. He is under pressure from the Eurosceptics. 
There has been a press campaign against me which he apparently 
cannot resist, so he chose to try to strengthen his domestic 
position--and it is not clear that will be the right path in the 
long run--rather than to play the European game and join the 
consensus. So in relation to the Twelve, and in particular to 
the Eleven who reached a consensus on my candidacy, this creates 
a problem, because we are not going to put ourselves in a 
situation where one says: no, and then all the others say: oh, 
all right, we give in and we'll go and look for someone else. 
  I am not speaking of the parliament, because when I see some 
of the initial reactions in the European Parliament, I say to 
myself that the European Council must pay great attention to 
what it does, because then there could be a return to form as 
far as parliament is concerned. [as heard] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with French Industry Minister Gerard Longuet by </F>
Jean-Louis Peytavin; place and date not given: "Gerard Longuet: 
`Priority to Services and Programs'" -- first paragraph is LE 
FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] The information superhighway is one of the major 
projects of the future. Gerard Longuet, minister of industry, 
postal services and telecommunications, and foreign trade, gave 
us his "liberal voluntarist" view on this major project (worth 
several hundred billion francs) without expecting state 
interventionism to take care of everything. 
  [Peytavin] What hopes do you put in the information 
superhighway? 
  [Longuet] To bring all French people revolutionary services 
to their homes, services which are all based on the exchange of 
images and data. These include personal exchanges, such as the 
videophone, as well as cultural and educational exchanges, and 
the development of teleworking. All in all, there has been a 
spectacular rise in transactions made from home, something which 
Minitel is giving us a preview of already. The convergence 
between optical and digital technologies enables this 
integration of telephone, television, and computer technologies. 
Hitherto unexplored areas are being opened up for consumers and 
new careers are appearing which will make it possible to create 
hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
<H5>  Public Effort and Private Initiative </H5>
  [Peytavin] The Bangemann report is being examined today in 
Corfu. Do you agree with its approach on the liberalization of 
telecommunications? 
  [Longuet] With one important reservation concerning the 
insufficient space given to missions of general interest, for 
example, town and country planning and tariff equalization, I 
broadly subscribe to his approach: namely, the active 
participation of the private sector, the liberalization of 
markets, and the launch of projects bringing together private 
initiatives and the public sector. 
  [Peytavin] How will the telecommunications monopolies 
evolve? 
  [Longuet] The national monopolies made it possible to 
implement universal telephone service. However, they are not 
compatible at European level with the deployment of networks and 
services that meet a considerably diversified demand. 
Competition provides the opportunity to decompartmentalize 
national markets and give new operators a chance in a booming 
market. 
  Nevertheless, it would be naive to believe that the market 
can just open up by magic and that the fruits of the information 
society will drop fully ripened into the hands of Europeans. 
Minitel is a good example of this: Major innovations are 
primarily the fruit of audacious strategies, most often 
combining public effort and private initiative. In other words, 
in a sector with a very high level of technology, such as the 
information superhighway, market dynamics have everything to 
gain from being complemented by a certain amount of state 
interventionism. This is what I call liberal interventionism. 
  [Peytavin] Should the state once more play an 
interventionist 
role as a planner of infrastructures? 
  [Longuet] Paradoxically, state intervention is less 
justified 
for infrastructures than for services. On the one hand, public 
planning of infrastructures is less and less necessary since 
there is no lack of private investors prepared to assume the 
sometimes extremely high costs of new infrastructures. This has 
been demonstrated by mobile phone networks. 
  Interventionism by the public authorities can even prove to 
be disastrous, as we saw with the cable plan, which was 
initiated by the Mauroy government in 1982. These kinds of 
economic mistakes must not be repeated at a time when France 
Telecom is preparing to confront competition in 1998. 
  On the other hand, the public sector must contribute, by 
setting regulations and acting as a catalyst, toward creating 
reference services and programs. Here, I am thinking in 
particular of health, education and vocational training, 
research, and town and country planning. These are all sectors 
where the information superhighway can meet very pressing needs 
in terms of social usefulness. The interventionism of the 
authorities will make it possible to kill two birds with one 
stone: putting the information superhighway at the service of 
society, and demonstrating to all economic operators the 
concrete merits of new communication technologies.

<F P=106> ["f.p." report: "Three Socialist Prime Ministers Warn </F>
Berlusconi: `No to AN Commissioners'"] 
  [Text] Corfu -- Three of [Italian Prime Minister] 
Berlusconi's 11 partners at the Corfu European Council have 
unambiguously warned him not to appoint any National Alliance 
members to the next European Commission. If this should happen 
-- Greece's Papandreou, Spain's Gonzalez, and Denmark's 
Rasmussen write -- they will do "everything in their power" to 
prevent the next European Commission from being ratified by the 
European Parliament. Up until now, this threat had been 
repeatedly made only by Socialist European deputies or by 
exponents of this political alignment. The difference now lies 
in the fact that the warning has been subscribed to by the 
Socialist parties' leaders who met yesterday morning in Corfu 
before the beginning of the European Council meeting. Among 
them, there were three who hold office in government and who, in 
this capacity, are taking part in the European summit which 
started yesterday evening. Jacques Delors -- who, as president 
of the European Commission, sits at the table of the heads of 
state or government -- was also there. With his, the signatures 
subscribing the warning add up to four. 
  Perhaps no one will want to spoil the party by repeating the 
warning in Berlusconi's face. However, it is written in black 
and white in the resolution adopted yesterday morning: It 
comprises 11 points, with the veto on "neofascists in the 
European Commission" constituting Point 10. In presenting the 
document to the press, Willy Claes -- the Belgian chairman of 
the Party of European Socialists -- made the message even 
clearer by explaining that the concern felt by his political 
alignment "is due, in particular, to the situation in Italy."

  [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur had his first meeting here Friday [24 
June] with Italy's new premier, Silvio Berlusconi. 
  French diplomats said the meeting had "gone well." It dealt 
with the contest to name a successor to European Commission 
president Jacques Delors, and with France's military 
intervention in Rwanda. 
  They said Balladur had been "agreeably surprised" by the 
performance of the Italian Government formed by Berlusconi in 
April, but shared general concern at the presence in his 
coalition cabinet of five neofascist members. 
  Berlusconi called the meeting "very cordial," and said he 
had 
raised the possibility of another meeting between the two men. 
  Earlier on the sidelines of the summit, Berlusconi had talks 
with British Prime Minister John Major. The two men agreed to 
meet again soon, but did not announce a date.

  [Excerpt] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- Britain and Italy 
on Friday [24 June] agreed to hold an Anglo-Italian summit 
meeting, British officials said after the first meeting between 
the two countries' leaders since Italian elections in March 
brought neofascists into the government. 
  British Prime Minister John Major and Italian Prime Minister 
Silvio Berlusconi agreed in principle to hold the Anglo-Italian 
summit, though the date and place were not yet decided, British 
officials said. 
  The Major-Berlusconi meeting, which took place on the 
sidelines of the 51st European Union [EU] summit here, lasted 75 
minutes and centred on the agenda for the meeting of EU leaders, 
British officials said. 
  Almost immediately after Berlusconi's nomination as the new 
Italian prime minister in April, British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd invited him to London for an Anglo-Italian summit. 
  Berlusconi ruffled British feathers by instead making his 
first foreign outing last week to Bonn, visiting German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
  Earlier in June he also met US President Bill Clinton when 
the US head of state was in Rome on a week-long European tour to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Rome and 
the D-Day landings. 
  The British and Italian leaders also discussed their 
position 
on the succession to Jacques Delors as European Commission 
president, the officials said, but declined further details.

<F P=106> [Report by George Jones and Christopher Lockwood: "Hopes </F>
Grow for Ulster Political Framework"] 
  [Text] Corfu -- Efforts to achieve a political settlement 
in Northern Ireland moved into a higher gear last night after Mr 
John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish Premier, signalled 
they were on course to produce a new document on the way forward 
next month. 
  Their hour-long talks during a break at the Corfu EC summit 
were described by British officials as "productive and cordial." 
  The optimism raised expectations that the two will be able 
to 
clear remaining obstacles to the publication of a framework 
agreement on a political settlement at an Anglo-Irish summit in 
July. 
  The document is seen as essential to ending the vacuum in 
Northern Ireland following December's Downing Street declaration. 
  Teams of officials from both governments accompanied Mr 
Major 
and Mr Reynolds to Corfu and got down to work last night on 
resolving differences over the repeal of Dublin's constitutional 
claim to Ulster and over the shape and authority of proposed 
joint boards to enhance cooperation. 
  The framework document will cover relations between London 
and Dublin, cross-border co-operation and outline plans for a 
new assembly in Northern Ireland. It is intended as the basis 
for restarting talks between the constitutional parties. The 
most controversial element is the proposal for new north-south 
institutions in Ireland, which is expected to arouse opposition 
from Ulster Unionists who will see it as a further surrender of 
sovereignty. 
  Mr Major is prepared to have cross-border executive boards 
to 
oversee a common approach to areas such as transport, energy, 
agriculture and tourism provided it is balanced by Dublin's 
agreement to repeal legislation giving it a constitutional claim 
to the province. 
  Richard Savill, Irish Correspondent, writes: Earlier it was 
disclosed that Mr Reynolds considered a united Ireland "by 
agreement and consent" would provide the best solution for the 
problems of Ulster -- an objective rejected by Unionists. 
  His comment is contained in a letter to the hardline Ulster 
Democratic Party which sought clarification of his 
interpretation of the Downing Street declaration. 
  Last night Mr Jim Wilson the Ulster Unionist general 
secretary, accused Mr Reynolds of "pouring petrol on the fire" 
at a time when the province was "volatile." 
  In Dublin, more than a third of the submissions to a Sinn 
Fein peace commission which took soundings from republicans and 
nationalists after the declaration have urged the IRA to call a 
unilateral ceasefire.

  [Text] In London, Britain and Israel have signed a joint 
research agreement. Representing Israel, Minister Shulamit 
Aloni welcomed the agreement, adding that it opens the way for 
Israeli scientists to participate in European research groups. 
Jerry Lewis reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Lewis] Initially for three years, about 
300,000 pounds per annum will be made available to route joint 
research projects to encourage the exchange of British and 
Israeli scientists. Mr. Waldegrave: 
  [Waldegrave] Well, it's the first time Britain has ever had 
an agreement exactly like this with any country, where we put 
the money from the government side in Britain together with the 
money from the Israeli Government side, plus a generous matching 
of that from some philanthropic sources -- the Rothschild 
Foundation and others -- to provide a fund for the development 
of scientific contacts between the two countries. 
  [Lewis] He added: It will begin to focus on collaborative 
research [word indistinct] technology, with an emphasis on 
fields relevant to medicine, electro-optics, lasers, [word 
indistinct] biology, and high-performance materials. He 
welcomed the cooperation, noting Israel had very good 
scientists, and predicted such cooperation would extend shortly 
to other fields in what he termed a wide-shared agenda that was 
a clear product of the peace dividend. 
  Shulamit Aloni emphasized the value to Israeli scientists: 
  [Aloni] For us it's important because it's an open way to 
the EC research group as well, and it's important because no 
country nowadays can go to the future without partners from 
other countries. 
  [Lewis] Facing the 21st century, she added, Israel did not 
have the resources other than minds, and it was important for 
Israel to develop joint projects, such as this in science and 
technology, with a hope for benefits and contacts in Europe as 
well. [end recording]

  [Text] The French Operation Turquoise in Rwanda is 
primarily a humanitarian operation. In the wake of soldiers 
dispatched to Bukavu, Zaire, to enter the western part of 
Rwanda, a full medical and surgical infrastructure is ready to 
be set up. Jean-Noel Ferre, a general with the French Army 
Medical Corps, outlined the technical details of the operation 
to Jean-Pierre Boris: 
  [Begin recording] [Ferre] This infrastructure is made up of 
a 
surgical team, with two surgeons and an anaesthetist, two 
medical teams including two doctors each, a 50-bed hospital 
section, a laboratory unit and an X-ray unit. 
  [Boris] What about the surgical unit? 
  [Ferre] The surgical unit is a simple surgical unit which 
can 
only carry out emergency surgery. It is manned by three 
doctors, two surgeons and an anaesthetist, six fully qualified 
nurses, and three soldiers. 
  This gives you a broad picture of the infrastructure we are 
setting up: On one hand a surgical unit for the troops, in case 
of fighting; and on the other hand a medical unit that includes 
a surgical team and two medical teams -- with laboratory and 
X-ray sections -- to cater to the refugees. [end recording]

  [Text] President Mitterrand spoke from Corfu, where he is 
attending the EU [European Union] summit, about the French 
intervention in Rwanda. Journalists asked the president if 
France had received enough backing from the international 
community. 
  [Begin Mitterrand recording] Enough, yes. There is a major 
difference between saying nothing and expressing support. When 
we asked the question, they all told us that they supported the 
French initiative. Now, you will ask me, are they supporting us 
by dispatching soldiers? Some will answer a call for logistical 
support, others are perhaps getting ready to supply troops, 
others, it depends. This is not only specific to the Twelve, 
proposals also came from Africa and from a few other countries. 
  First of all, the deployment of equipment and troops took 
place in excellent conditions; it was very well organized. The 
move into Rwandan territory often took place with the very warm 
agreement of the people, if I can trust what you journalists are 
writing as well as our own information. [end recording]

involvement in UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda], the UN 
force in Rwanda, which is being rebuilt. More details from 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] Our initiative is already reaping 
very substantial diplomatic benefits, since it is accelerating 
the setting up of UNAMIR. Canada has just announced its 
readiness to offer UNAMIR 350 soldiers and a communication unit. 
Tunisia has offered 500 soldiers, Pakistan has stressed its 
readiness to transfer some of its contingents from UNOSOM [UN 
Operation in Somalia] to Rwanda, and, at last, the United States 
has already transported equipment for UNAMIR to Uganda. 
  We suggested that the UN secretary general coordinate the

suggested setting up a contact group of the main contributing 
countries under the aegis of the Secretariat General. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard, in </F>
Frejus, southern France, by Bruno Masure at the France-2 studio 
in Paris; the interview is interspersed with video reports on 
the situation in Rwanda--live] 
  [Text] [Masure] We will now speak to Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard, who is in Frejus, in southern France. Good 
evening, Mr. Leotard. Before mentioning the diplomatic or 
political aspects of this case, let me ask you a couple of 
questions on the purely military aspect. Is it conceivable that 
French troops will enter the areas controlled by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]? 
  [Leotard] The instructions we gave our forces are two-fold: 
first, to develop the humanitarian action, that is to survey the 
sites where people are threatened or facing difficult sanitation 
or food problems; second, not to approach the front line. The 
front line more or less cuts through Rwanda north to south -- in 
the south, on the road from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi. We 
avoid getting close to that line for the time being, because it 
can be a line where Rwandan army, militias, and the RPF are 
clashing. 
  [Masure] Tension was reported at a certain number of 
roadblocks today and General Germanos, who is at the scene, says 
the situation is fragile. Aren't you worried? 
  [Leotard] He is right, and I would like to say that the 
video 
report I just saw is extremely interesting and positive, but we 
should avoid any untimely satisfaction. The situation is 
extremely fragile, and Gen. Germanos was right to say so. It is 
characterized by many uncertainties, and we do not know 
everything about the situation. We now have fewer than 500 
soldiers in Rwanda in a relatively large area and, as we saw in 
the report, we do not know all the distressful situations we may 
face. I believe we must be extremely prudent. I repeat that 
our role is to wait for the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda] II, which is the UN force replacing us as 
early as possible, I hope. We are scouting the area, observing 
what is going on, listening, and going to places where dangerous 
situations are reported. We do what we can physically do. 
  [Masure] I would like to ask you a personal question. What 
do you feel when you see French soldiers in this difficult 
environment? 
  [Leotard] As the man in charge of French defense, naturally 
I 
am extremely happy to see French soldiers welcome. I must 
stress that we did not know what the reception would be like. 
It could have been dangerous or difficult, and it can be 
tomorrow, tomorrow morning, so we must be very careful. There 
is a generous feeling driving many French to help a country in 
distress, but the government also does not want to risk the 
lives of our soldiers and does not want to give this military 
presence, even if it has a peaceful and humanitarian aim, a 
character of provoking one or the other party. As you see, the 
men carrying out this mission do so very tactfully, but it is a 
very difficult situation because there is no clash. We do not 
want a clash, and for soldiers this requires a great deal of 
self-control with relatively modest means. There is also an 
important question: What do we do with refugees and how? We are 
now in touch with the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] 
to make sure that food and medical aid follow, enabling these 
refugees to be properly treated. 
  [Masure] Mr. Defense Minister, the purity, if you will 
pardon the expression, of French intentions was strongly 
criticized before the start of this intervention, including by 
our very close allies, both European and American. Do you feel 
now that you have reassured them, or do you feel that there is a 
political evolution? 
  [Leotard] I believe this evolution is taking place. We are 
in permanent contact with our partners at the Western European 
Union, among others, and with the Americans. I myself had talks 
with several of my counterparts--European defense ministers--and 
it has gradually transpired that, first, they are going to help 
us with the logistics and with health equipment. Second, they 
support our concept politically: the idea that we are there 
temporarily only until the UNAMIR II -- that is, the UN force 
mission -- arrives. I believe this is France's position. 
  It may be necessary to explain it further, but we do not 
intend to stay at all, nor do we not intend to carry out 
military actions. I would like to point this out again if 
necessary. We are there because there was a lot of concern in 
France and throughout the world, and justifiably so, after these 
massacres, and we believed that the international community 
could not accept genocide in 1994, because this was the real 
issue. 
  We regretted the fact that we were the only ones to do so 
at the beginning. I believe some countries, including African 
countries, because this is the key, are joining us; I hope there 
will be many more. We have been given the assurance that some 
Senegalese will be able to take part in the operation tomorrow; 
I hope that the Ghanaians will be able to do the same in a few 
days. We hope the Africans themselves will be able to manage 
this type of conflict, this type of crisis, themselves in the 
future. It is first and foremost their responsibility. We do 
not intend to replace them at all. 
  [Masure] Francois Leotard, a last question: Can you confirm 
to the families of these French soldiers in Rwanda that they 
will all be back home in two months and that whatever happens 
they will hand over to the UNAMIR II at the end of July? 
  [Leotard] This is our intention. The prime minister 
mentioned the end of July before the National Assembly: We are 
going to do our utmost to respect this goal. The French, on the 
whole--it is often the case, including politically....[pauses] 
when French soldiers are involved, that there should be a 
maximum of support and unanimity around them. This is a fair 
mission, a difficult one, perhaps a risky one over the next 
couple of days, and it is necessary for French opinion--I know 
that this is the case-- but for politicians, among others, to 
avoid criticism and opposition. These are the soldiers of 
France and, in an operation that is desired by many of those who 
are threatened, is supported and desired by the government, even 
if we are a bit lonely. We are sticking together and closing 
ranks, and we try to support our soldiers. I believe this is the 
least we can do. 
  [Masure] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article signed J.I.: "Intensive and Often Clandestine </F>
Military Assistance"] 
  [Text] Since the middle of 1990, when the French Armed 
Forces came to the rescue of President Habyarimana's Hutu 
regime, French assistance to Kigali had been especially 
significant and often discreet, if not clandestine. At its 
peak, France even went as far as providing Rwanda's governmental 
army with some 150 French Government consultants or military 
advisers on permanent secondment, not to mention the 400 
paratroopers sent in 1993 to fight the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
(RPF), which at the time was backed by Uganda. In addition, it 
supplied no less than 20 million francs [Fr] in military 
equipment each year (or Fr40 million, including soldiers' pay). 
  The men sent to Rwanda to train its regular army mostly 
belonged to the 1st Marine Paratrooper Corps (RPIMa), normally 
based in Bayonne. 
  The 1st RPIMa is directly under the command of the army 
chief 
of staff; it is a unit which performs special missions. It was 
sometimes relieved by teams from the 13th Corps of Paratrooper 
Dragoons (RDP) based in Dieuze (Moselle), whose forte is 
reconnaissance operations deep into hostile terrain. Commandos 
belonging to the 13th RDP even entered Uganda covertly to assess 
the nature of the assistance provided by this country to RPF 
fighters. 
  Equipment provided by France, some of which was supplied for 
free, to the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) was very diverse, 
including light armored vehicles, Gazelle helicopters, Noratlas 
or Guerrier aircraft, and pieces of field artillery. When the 
fighting between the RPF and President Habyarimana's army was at 
its fiercest, the guns were sometimes operated by French 
soldiers. 
<H5>  Traumatized French Soldiers </H5>
  Similarly, French advisers were provided with 
light-intensifier binoculars which make it possible to see and 
shoot at night just as if it is broad daylight, in case they 
needed to carry out clandestine actions. Binoculars of this 
type were then left in the hands of the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
  For his travel needs, President Habyarimana was given a 
Falcon 50 tri-jet aircraft (which was shot down, probably with a 
ground-to-air missile, while landing on 6 April) to replace a 
Caravelle III aircraft. 
  Never, however, were French military advisers instructed to 
supervise or train Hutu militias, whose role in the exactions 
perpetrated in Rwanda are today acknowledged by all, and which 
are even now still slaughtering Hutu civilians. These militias, 
whose weapons are often rather primitive, are complacently left 
to their own devices by Rwanda's regular army, which relies on 
them for the "dirty jobs" it wants to have carried out in the 
field. 
  Among those French soldiers who evacuated foreign nationals 
in April as part of operation "Amaryllis," after President 
Habyarimana's plane was downed, some remember being assaulted by 
Hutu militiamen who had gone berserk. Worse, some of the French 
soldiers who were sent to Rwanda to escort some 1,420 foreign 
nationals to Bangui (Central African Republic) had to witness -- 
without being able to intervene -- crimes committed by Hutu 
militias in Kigali and the surrounding countryside. Today, 
these French soldiers admit that they remain "traumatized" by 
orders forbidding them to react, even while massacres were going 
on under their eyes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mitterrand: Fighting </F>
Euroskepticism"] 
  [Text] In an interview with the Greek Government daily TA 
NEA [as published], the text of which was released by the Elysee 
[presidential office] press department yesterday, President 
Francois Mitterrand recommends "bringing Europe closer to its 
citizens." 
  Speaking on the eve of the Corfu summit, the head of state 
did "not deny that certain external phenomena" -- the slowing of 
world growth, jittery financial markets, and international 
disturbances -- could "affect or even delay" the "process for 
the unification" of Europe. 
  However, he insisted: "It is precisely during these 
difficult times that we must stand firm." To fight 
"Euroskepticism," he called for "the wise reform of institutions 
and practices in order to bring Europe closer to its citizens, 
to take into account the aspirations of its peoples, and to 
improve the operation of the Union to make it more efficient." 
  For Francois Mitterrand, the constant enlargement of the 
Union should not make it too ponderous and thus reduce its 
decisionmaking capacity and ability to act. Europe, he stressed 
forcefully, is not just "a geographical zone, but a collective 
will, with institutions that now deserve to be touched up to 
inject fresh impetus." 
  As for the risk, mentioned by some people, of a trend toward 
a "German Europe" as a result of the enlargement toward Austria 
and the Scandinavian countries, the head of state stated: 
"Neither France nor Germany want to make a French or German 
Europe." In his opinion, the "will" of the two countries, whose 
"union is of course fundamental," is "to create a free, 
prosperous, and democratic Europe for the whole continent."

  [Text] Paris, June 26, INA--French Foreign Ministry said an 
official Iraqi delegation is currently in France for talks with 
various French companies. 
  A Ministry spokesman admitted that this visit by the Iraqi 
delegation, which is composed of petroleum experts, was not the 
first to be made by an Iraqi group and noted that all nations 
had legitimate right to do so. 
  The spokesman added that the delegation's visit came only 
one 
day after the meeting between Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special 
Commission, and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  Ekeus' current visit to Paris falls within a tour of many 
European capitals prior to the July Security Council discussions 
of the UN resolutions on Iraq.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F>
Laurent Maudit; place and date not given: "No Panic, Recovery 
Is Solid"] 
  [Text] It was a tough week on the financial markets. 
Following setbacks on the stock exchanges at the beginning of 
the week, the dollar experienced a sudden plunge until the 
situation was reestablished on most markets yesterday. Economy 
Minister Edmond Alphandery draws here the lessons from these 
successive jolts. He replies in passing to businessmen who are 
requesting further measures to bolster economic activity. 
  [Maudit] Were you in a cold sweat this past week? 
  [Alphandery] No, not really. Now that things have started 
going better, now that the real economy is picking up, and the 
international environment is improving, we must keep cool and 
not give too much importance to financial movements that were 
clearly amplified by exaggerated psychological reactions. 
  [Maudit] You speak as if no serious jolts had been 
experienced this week on the market. 
  [Alphandery] Of course there have been. There was some 
turbulence. But it will be overcome because the basic economic 
trends are positive. Recovery is being confirmed in Europe. 
Japanese plans to boost the economy are beginning to have 
effect, beyond expectations. Finally, the American economy is 
still growing, though more slowly than before. The good news is 
that the three great locomotives of the world economy are now 
pulling again in the same direction. What is more -- and this 
had not happened for a long time -- they are doing so 
synchronously. This is why I feel calm. 
  [Maudit] However, the drop of the dollar is rather worrying. 
  [Alphandery] This is an exaggeration. It is true, however, 
that the dollar has dropped considerably, which has given rise 
to certain questions being posed in the United States, Japan, 
and Europe. No doubt, this weakness partly explains the recent 
tensions over long- term interest rates. But I am not worried 
about the future, because I believe that economic reality will 
prevail. 
  [Maudit] So you remain an optimist, despite and against 
everything? 
  [Alphandery] Not an optimist, but rather, cool-headed. There 
are as many explanations for the dollar's drop as there are 
economists. Nevertheless, two major factors are often 
pinpointed to explain this trend. To begin with, the U.S. trade 
deficit, which this year may amount to as much as $150 billion 
(more than 820 billion French francs). Second, there are fears 
that inflation may reappear in the United States. In both 
cases, we should not overestimate the dangers involved. With 
recovery under way in Europe and Japan, America's deficit should 
gradually decrease. Besides, I agree with Federal Reserve 
chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, with whom I had long conversations this week, in 
believing that there is no risk of inflation getting out of 
control. I am therefore convinced that the markets over-reacted 
in the short term -- as they often do -- and that the situation 
will develop favorably. 
  [Maudit] Are you also minimizing the importance of the stock 
exchange crisis? 
  [Alphandery] I am not minimizing anything. I am simply 
saying that when long-term interest rates tend to increase, they 
necessarily have an impact on the stock markets. However, I see 
no reason why long-term interest rates should continue to remain 
high in European countries overall. In fact, we began to 
observe an easing up by midweek. It is only natural: There is 
no risk of inflation; the economy is healthy and there is a 
strong savings base to finance investment. 
  [Maudit] So why did the stock exchange plunge? Are the 
markets blind? 
  [Alphandery] They sometimes amplify the movements, but they 
are not blind. This is why I would not be surprised if the 
stock exchange bounces back up again. Let me tell you, on the 
other hand, that according to a study conducted by the "Associes 
en Finance" [Financial Partners] research institute on the main 
companies quoted on the Paris stock exchange, CAC 40 [Paris 
Stock Exchange index] companies may well see their profits 
increase by 31.2 percent this year. In 1995, they may even 
surpass the record levels achieved in 1989. 
  [Maudit] Do you not feel that the markets are particularly 
concerned about the situation in France? Is this because of the 
problems with public finances, or because of political 
uncertainties? 
  [Alphandery] I do not share this feeling in the least. For a 
very simple reason: In the field of the government deficit, 15 
months ago we opted for a very clear line -- namely, 
restructuring. In particular, although nobody was forcing us to 
do so, we drafted a five-year law setting our objectives with 
regard to reducing the public deficit. Everybody knows this: 
France has now taken the management of its deficit in hand 
  [Maudit] Nothing, then, is likely to hamper economic 
recovery? 
  [Alphandery] I do not think so. If you look at the latest 
indicator available to us -- namely, the consumption of 
manufactured products -- the May results are of course not quite 
as good as the exceptionally high April results, but they are 
better than the results obtained in March. The underlying trend 
is therefore positive. Overall, I believe the growth rate of 
economic activity in the second quarter will be higher than in 
the first quarter, which leads me to confirm my expectation that 
our 1.4-percent growth forecast will be surpassed this year. 
  [Maudit] This outlook is not shared at all by employers, who 
believe recovery is rather too slow and are requesting further 
measures to boost economic activity. 
  [Alphandery] It would be best to ask employers individually 
what they think about the situation. I meet many of them in the 
field who tell me that things are definitely getting better. I 
believe that when the figures for the second quarter are 
published, everybody will be able to realize that this is in 
fact the case. What satisfies me most is the fact that we are 
getting quicker results than expected with regard to the 
employment situation. We are getting there: The French economy 
is again creating jobs. Unfortunately, we have not yet reached 
the stage where we can absorb the number of new arrivals on the 
labor market, but let us be patient, we will eventually get 
there! I do not believe I have misled anybody through my 
forecasts so far. 
  [Maudit] Is there no need, then, for the further support 
measures demanded by employers? 
  [Alphandery] You know, I am sure, that I pay a lot of 
attention to this issue. For example, early in the year I felt 
it was necessary to bolster the automobile industry. The 
economy was recovering, but not in this particular sector. We 
therefore advocated support measures for the car industry, and 
these measures achieved the expected aim. 
  [Maudit] So, are you basically telling employers that there 
will be no new measures? 
  [Alphandery] Future measures to consolidate growth? Such 
measures have already been planned and will take effect in the 
second half of 1994. They will include, in particular, 
increased financial allowances for students returning to school 
after the summer vacation. In addition, thanks to a more 
buoyant European environment, demand for French products will 
continue to increase. The CNPF [National Council of French 
Employers] can therefore say what it likes, there are no dark 
clouds on the horizon.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bank of France Governor: `We Must </F>
Keep Cool'"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday, 22 June, [Bank of France Governor] 
Jean-Claude Trichet stated: "We must keep cool (...). Central 
bankers are vigilant and have always proved that they are there 
and are able to maintain the necessary framework for stability." 
Invited by the Europe No. 1 radio station to talk about the 
collapse of the dollar against the yen, the Bank of France 
governor added that the G-7, the group of the seven most 
industrialized countries (which is to meet in Naples at the 
beginning of July) is "the place where we can verify whether the 
framework for stability is suitable." After noting that the 
dollar "is potentially stronger than it appears," Mr. Trichet 
expressed the opinion that the current difficulties have 
"nothing to do with" the 1987 stock market crash but are due to 
an economic recovery that has been "badly interpreted by some 
people (...). What counts are the basic and objective figures 
for the economies," he stressed, "and these figures are good." 
  The previous day, Hans Tietmayer, president of the German 
central bank, the Bundesbank, had expressed his satisfaction 
with how the European Monetary System [EMS] was operating. 
Thanks to the widening of its fluctuation bands after the 
monetary crisis of August 1993, the EMS has become "flexible." 
Mr. Tietmayer told members of Atlantikbruecke, the U.S.-German 
friendship society: "Previously, fluctuations in the dollar 
would certainly have caused tensions within the system."

<F P=106> [Report signed by "J.-L.L.": "Chirac: Manifesto To Open </F>
the Campaign"] 
  [Text] The secret had been well kept. Everybody knew that 
Jacques Chirac was calmly filling dozens of pages in a country 
house close to Paris. But the RPR [Rally for the Republic] 
president caused editorial and political surprise by publishing 
his initial thoughts on changing France. Thus the mayor of 
Paris is resuming the initiative with a view to the 1995 
presidential election in the sphere of ideas, by cautiously 
refusing to officially reveal his intentions. "Is this a 
declaration of candidacy?" he was asked. "Certainly not. A 
declaration of candidacy is the opening of the campaign. That 
would be absolutely premature at this stage." 
  Basing himself on a tough "media schedule" (30 minutes live 
from the City Hall at 2000 on TF1 yesterday evening; interviews 
with AFP, LE FIGARO, and Luxembourg Radio and Television), the 
RPR leader is displaying modest ambitions. He simply says that 
this little work of 141 pages is aimed at "fueling the big 
exchange of ideas" with one year to go before a crucial election 
for the country. "I have neither the ambition nor the desire to 
review all the subjects with which we are dealing or which 
concern us. Still less to draw up a plan for society. I have 
tried to provide some possible answers," the Paris mayor warns 
in the introduction to this book entitled A New France. 
Reflections 1. 
  Dedicating his book "to post-1968 young people," the RPR 
president wants to win them over to his conviction that "in a 
changing environment, there is no greater risk than standing 
still." His diagnosis? At the end of the seven-year 
[presidential] term, France "shows the signs of a dangerously 
divided society, one which is dependent and, to some extent, 
demotivated." Is Edouard Balladur to blame? Without naming the 
prime minister, Jacques Chirac does him the credit of saying 
that "our country has been wisely governed for the past year." 
He even thinks that a "degree of recovery is perceptible," but 
reaffirmed that "the problem is still a deep one." This problem 
relates to the unsuitability of the existing "tools," "forged at 
a time of full employment, growth, and inflation" and which 
require "great efforts for paltry results." 
  The RPR president, the advocate of "real changes," is 
convinced that the French are ready to accept the "constraints" 
provided these reforms are "simple, that they seem effective, 
that the burden is fairly distributed, and that the weakest 
countries are protected." Two key words define Jacques Chirac's 
ambition: "solidarity and social cohesion." And the solutions? 
The RPR leader merely defined the main axes of his social and 
European policy, the role of the institutions, taking up 
proposals made during his tour of the regions. The objective 
was not to submit "ready-made solutions," one of his close aides 
explained, but to give a few initial ideas for consideration (a 
second volume is planned). "I hope that the coming presidential 
election will make it possible to open up a real broad debate on 
ideas, eliminating, once and for all, the eternal personal 
rivalries," Jacques Chirac writes in conclusion out of an 
obvious concern to "rise above" these.

<F P=106> [Report signed by "A.F.": "Independent Republican Party </F>
Group: Much Ado About Nothing"] 
  [Excerpt] The elephant gave birth to a mouse. After any 
number of meetings, confabs, and minipsychodramas, the tension 
was finally released in the Republican Party [PR]. Charles 
Millon and [Trade and Industry Minister] Gerard Longuet 
prevented the party from breaking away from the Union for French 
Democracy [UDF] group in the National Assembly. The PR 
president, as well as Honorary President [and Defense Minister] 
Francois Leotard, had been nonetheless rather in favor of this 
idea. Faced with the division that this initiative caused, 
however, Gerard Longuet chose the path of prudence and kept the 
party within the UDF. 
  Defusing the crisis that began on 14 June, the party 
deputies, meeting in the presence of the industry minister on 
Wednesday evening [22 June] therefore unanimously voted to adopt 
a motion defining the aims and strategy of the PR in the light 
of the upcoming presidential election. In the text adopted at 
the end of the meeting, which lasted more than one and a half 
hour, the deputies confirmed that they wanted to prepare for the 
presidential election of 1995 "in the best possible conditions," 
in order to avoid the fratricidal and bloody battles that marked 
the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections. For them, this means 
supporting the candidate for the majority, a principle that had 
been adopted, they stressed, by the UPF (UDF and RPR [Rally for 
the Republic]) in 1990. Speaking yesterday on the RTL station, 
Philippe Vasseur, PR secretary general and deputy for the Pas de 
Calais region, stated: "The union candidate can be anyone within 
in the majority (...). We must stop saying that it should be 
the prime minister." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Air Force Chief of Staff Adelchi Pillinini </F>
by Carlo di Risio; place and date not given: "The Odyssey of 
the Air Bases"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Di Risio] How do the Armed 
Forces think they can secure their priority task -- namely, with 
regard to manned interceptor aircraft? 
  [Pillinini] The manned component of the air defense consists 
today of seven squadrons of E-104S aircraft. This aircraft is 
still able to provide optimal performance as a pure interceptor. 
However, there is a need for an aircraft which can oppose new 
generation aircraft and which has a sufficient flying range, 
including via inflight refueling, and is able to operate 
internationally. The arms system able to meet this requirement 
has been identified in the form of the Eurofighter 2000, the 
fruit of cooperation of the aircraft industries of Italy, Great 
Britain, Germany, and Spain. In the program, the Air Force has 
made provision for a total of 130 aircraft. And it should be 
pointed out that 130 aircraft are the minimum number which are 
essential in order to secure the defense of our national 
airspace, compared with an "optimal" demand originally put at 
165 aircraft. 
  The first two prototypes (the German and the English) flew 
early spring, but the line can be operational only from 2002 
onward. From the need to secure the continuity of the manned 
aircraft defense system, where we risk a crisis of continuity 
between the E-104-ASA and the E.F.-2000, there arose the demand 
for a transitional solution which makes operational sense within 
the new strategic context and which is feasible in our country's 
present situation. We had to assess the possibility of having 
aircraft available at short notice, taking account also the 
effects of involving the Armed Forces with a new model of 
aircraft, with its subsequent impact on equipment and all the 
technical-logistical and financial repercussions. At the same 
time, the Air Force and the government remained firmly resolved 
to continue the Eurofighter program. 
  From among the solutions assessed, which involved leasing 
quotas of F-15's, F-16's, and Tornado ADV's, we went for the 
solution of leasing 24 Tornado ADV's from the RAF [Royal Air 
Force] for 10 years (1995-2005), and operating them alongside 
around 100 modified E-104-ASA's. These modifications involve 
work to extend the life and improve the technical reliability of 
the aircraft and the engines, and adding certain avionics 
subsystems. I believe the Tornado ADV/E-104-ASAM solution, 
which is the fruit of a careful and realistic examination of the 
situation, is the optimal answer for the Armed Forces, from the 
viewpoint of acquiring the E.F.-2000 at the beginning of the 
next decade. 
  [Di Risio] There is a recurrent demand for economy and the 
need to restructure the military instrument without delay, 
making it smaller but more flexible and effective. How has the 
Air Force confronted this problem, in particular in terms of air 
bases? 
  [Pillinini] The air bases are a key element in the ability 
of 
the Air Force to operate. The restructuring of the Air Force, 
which moreover is already under way with the scrapping of 
obsolete aircraft, which have not been replaced, appeared to be 
leading possibly to the closing of certain bases with obvious 
potential management savings. 
  In fact, after careful examination, this proved impossible, 
given that the majority of our airports lack sufficient 
reception capacity for the units which continue to exist. 
Increasing such reception capacity would require considerable 
resources for expropriating land, the construction of new 
infrastructures, and so on, involving investments which today 
are certainly not possible. Moreover, certain of our airports 
are open to civilian traffic. 
  Despite this, we are working to transfer the combat units 
from certain airports (Brindisi, Rimini, and Treviso) which are 
now completely enclosed by residential areas. However, we have 
to continue to keep the structures and services in these 
airports operational. Finally, we decided that the 24 air bases 
in operation today can be reduced to 20, but we will not achieve 
any savings unless we can close and abandon the installations 
for good. 
  [Di Risio] The 46th Airborne Brigade, stationed at Pisa, is 
being committed more and more frequently during operations, 
often very far from Italy, in ever less safe operating theaters 
(Somalia, Mozambique, Yemen, Rwanda). Within this delicate 
operating sector, which is seeing Italy involved in the 
international arena, what is the present situation of Air 
Transportation and what are the programs for confronting future 
needs? 
  [Pillinini] The importance of transport aircraft has been 
recognized unambiguously in the New Defense Model itself which, 
against a background of general cuts in personnel and resources, 
provides for a significant increase in the transportation fleet. 
  Right now, however, we can count on a line of G-222's which, 
even though available in sufficient number and ideal in certain 
climatic conditions, does not meet the demands of medium- to 
long-range transport, and on a series of C-130 "Hercules," 
available in a fairly limited number but which is also able to 
meet long-range needs. 
  In the short term, there are no plans for acquiring new 
aircraft and we will therefore continue to operate with the same 
craft, which will, however, require technical work in the form 
of a midlife modernization. 
  Work is going ahead on a new aircraft, the "Future Large 
Aircraft" (FLA), in which Germany, France, and the other 
European countries are also interested, and which ought to 
respond to our global transportation demands. Assuming the 
program is continued, the aircraft will not, however, be 
available before the second half of the next decade. In the 
intervening period, a buffer solution will perhaps have to be 
sought in this area as well. 
  [Di Risio] Why is compensation slow at being imposed in the 
case of aerial incidents involving the civilian population? 
  [Pillinini] Compensation for damage in the case of aerial 
incidents involving the civilian population involves extremely 
delicate and difficult themes. It is true, right now there are 
people who have suffered damage who have not been compensated, 
or only partially. 
  In the present state of affairs, the complexity of the 
administrative procedure in force for defining compensation for 
damages by means of individual settlements renders pointless the 
considerable amount of committed work undertaken by the Defense 
Ministry's Directorate General for Disputes, generating a large 
number of disagreements and polemics, including suits for 
damages. The time periods involved are considerably lengthened 
if the damaged parties, instead of respecting the proposed 
settlements, prefer to take recourse to the Civil Judicial 
Authorities, or if the families of the victims put in private 
claims for damages, alongside the prosecution. 
  In this direction the Air Force General Staff has since 1986 
been committed to promoting Law No. 424 of 27 October 1993 
which, as from 1 January 1986, provides, within a relatively 
short time frame, for intervention to assist citizens and 
victims of incidents occurring during operational and training 
activities. 
  We believe that it is now necessary to align our legislation 
without delay with that of the most advanced nations, through 
organic reform of the legislation governing the consequences of 
such incidents, with provisions for a procedure for paying 
compensation for damage within a shorter time frame. In this 
respect we are undertaking certain detailed examinations in 
order to make operating proposals. At the same time, it would 
be a good thing to provide better legal aid and assistance to 
the military personnel involved in carrying out activities 
connected with the Armed Forces institutional tasks. 
  In this regard it would be desirable, within the present 
legislative period, to approve an initiative, presented in 1979 
and proposed again during the present legislative period by 
Senator Savio, based on which -- while maintaining the principle 
of compensation by the state for damage to private individuals 
-- the responsibility of military personnel involved in 
incidents to pay compensation out of their own pocket be limited 
to cases of intent to cause damage or serious fault, with 
military personnel defended free-of-charge in court by the State 
Attorney's Office or by a freely chosen attorney of confidence, 
subject to recourse by the administration where liability for 
malicious incident is ascertained.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Piero Visani: "High Quality Options for the </F>
Military"] 
  [Text] Reforming the Armed Forces is one of the top 
priorities on the new government's agenda. Indeed, the hatchet 
of an absurd, penny-pinching policy has been taken to the 
Italian military capability over recent years, reducing defense 
spending to little more than 1 percent of gross domestic 
product. The result of these unfounded decisions by the last 
few governments of the First Republic has been that our country 
has found itself without the essential foreign policy support 
provided by a military capability when developments on the 
international political scene made it crucial to have one. The 
situation is compounded by the restrictions imposed on a sector 
that has traditionally been at the forefront of technology, the 
arms industry -- such tight restrictions that they give grounds 
for suspecting lucrative collusion with the competition in the 
best "bribe city" style -- and the dominant cultures' continuing 
demonization of anything remotely connected with the "military" 
sphere. 
  Now that the new cabinet is giving clear signs that it 
intends to assume a much more definite role and acquire a higher 
profile at international level, the necessity of imparting new 
vigor to the Armed Forces, in other words to the means most 
traditionally used to back foreign policy, has become manifest, 
and Defense Minister Previti has been more than explicit on the 
subject. 
  The renovation of the Italian military apparatus requires a 
rise in quality standards, to be achieved not just by increasing 
defense spending but, first and foremost, by deploying this 
spending more wisely, so as to create a tool relying more on the 
quality of its operational units and the means and equipment at 
their disposal than on the quantity of bureaucratic structures 
and bodies of greater or lesser utility. 
  One of the crucial aspects of such decisions in favor of 
quality is undoubtedly the growing professionalization of the 
Armed Forces in view of the fact that the increasing complexity 
of modern warfare means that it cannot be waged by poorly 
trained draftees but requires arms professionals capable of 
acquitting themselves with the maximum skill in a range of 
different operational situations, peacekeeping and 
peace-enforcing missions currently being the main ones envisaged. 
  However, we must define the real nature of military 
careerism 
with extreme clarity. 
  To cite the well-known distinction drawn by U.S. sociologist 
Charles C. Moskos, when the Armed Forces decide to recruit a 
substantial number of volunteers, they must maintain a 
fundamentally institutional organizational structure, resisting 
the temptation to adopt an occupational structure. The 
institutional model responds to a set of values and standards 
that transcend individual interests and serve the collective 
interest, and it is marked by a high level of idealism. The 
occupational model, on the other hand, tends to turn the 
military career into a job like any other, lacking ideals and 
concerned solely with obtaining pay rises and union guarantees. 
  Ever since its initial proposals on voluntary recruitment, 
the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has been fighting for an Army 
made up of professionals motivated by high ideals, and not for a 
crowd of odd-jobbers. 
  Today, National Alliance cannot but confirm this stance, 
bearing in mind, however, that, particularly in times of 
economic recession, the temptation for many young men to opt for 
a military career as a remedy for widespread unemployment may be 
very strong. 
  Nevertheless, the fact that this need exists must not be 
seen 
as a limiting factor, but rather as a welcome opportunity to 
improve relations between youth and the Armed Forces. 
  In a recent interview granted to the specialized journal, 
PANORAMA DIFESA, General Incisa di Camerana, Army chief of 
general staff, pointed out that the country's current economic 
problems had definitely enhanced voluntary recruitment, but he 
also added that a large number of the volunteers seemed to be 
driven by high ideals that transcended short-term economic 
necessity. 
  This is the human foundation on which we must aim to build a 
new, high quality military capability; a force whose major 
concerns are not so much job stability, pay rises, and pension 
rights (which must nevertheless not be neglected, provided they 
are kept in the right perspective), but rather the ability to do 
one's job at all times and in any circumstances, and to do it 
according to the ethical principles and values that the military 
institution has traditionally made its own. 
  This will also create the conditions for improving relations 
between the governing forces and the officer corps. 
  The latter, indeed, has for decades had its high ideal 
motives unfairly undermined by governments who made no secret of 
their basic contempt for anything with "military" associations. 
  The creation of a new, modern, military capability requires 
a 
decision to go for quality in this sphere as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Transportation Minister Publio Fiori by </F>
Franco Fatone in Rome; date not given: "How To Reduce the 
Deficit? It Is All Roses and Fiori"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The squeeze is on its way. These are the 
words of Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini. Meanwhile, however, 
Transportation Minister Publio Fiori is suggesting how the 
council of ministers can recuperate 50 trillion lire without 
cuts or taxes. He is practically a magician: "It involves five 
items," he explains to L'INDIPENDENTE, "that will enable us to 
block the INPS [National Institute for Social Security] deficit. 
Trust in me." The trust is granted. Meanwhile, Fiori is 
expecting a less drastic budget that will relaunch the economy. 
  [Fatone] Minister, what deadlines do you foresee? 
  [Fiori] We must start immediately. A climate of uncertainty 
is emerging both in the internal and international markets. And 
this may not encourage the signs of recovery in our country. 
  [Fatone] Must we speed things up? 
  [Fiori] Yes. We must immediately clarify what policies the 
government intends to adopt. 
  [Fatone] Should we expect a drastic budget? 
  [Fiori] No. But I trust in a very serious budget. 
  [Fatone] In what sense? 
  [Fiori] In the sense that we must not focus on the theme of 
public finances. Instead the first concern must be the 
development of the economy. 
  [Fatone] Could you explain yourself better? 
  [Fiori] Certainly! Perhaps, for too long now we have made 
the mistake of sacrificing the economy to balance our public 
accounts. While, if by absurdity, there was to be a period of 
confidence among our citizen voters, we could even draw up a 
medium-term plan that would take account of a worsening in the 
public accounts, provided, however, that it would be drawn up 
with the intention of relaunching the economy. 
  [Fatone] Excuse me, but your thesis is still unclear. 
  [Fiori] Let me explain myself better then. What I want to 
say is that we must not work at balancing public spending at the 
cost of suffocating the economy, but that we need to relaunch 
the economy to pay for the public deficit with the wealth that 
would be produced. 
  [Fatone] Yet the lancets of the cuts will affect spending. 
Pensions are the target... 
  [Fiori] This is absurd. It would be a mistake to start with 
the policy of cuts again. Pensions have been sacrificed for 
years and it would be unjust to think that recovery can be made 
to bear upon the shoulders of the weak, the pensioners again. 
  [Fatone] According to you, would it be necessary to reverse 
the trend? 
  [Fiori] Of course. Not only this: The pensioners must be 
guaranteed that which has been established by the Constitutional 
Court, and pensions must also be linked to salaries. I repeat, 
the continuation of the phenomenon of year-based pensions that 
we all know is unjust. 
  [Fatone] There is no doubt, however, that the financial 
burden will be considerable. Do you agree? 
  [Fiori] Certainly. However, we must immediately work out a 
reentry system and at the same time reflect on how to manage the 
payment of this debt. This is not an impossible operation. 
There are already some rather clear ideas on how to overcome 
this obstacle easily. 
  [Fatone] Many people, however, expect to see cuts in public 
spending in the budget. The axe could even fall upon 
transports... 
  [Fiori] Anything can be done under a budget. I would exclude 
any transport cuts, however. It is a wrong political choice. 
  [Fatone] Why? 
  [Fiori] Transportation infrastructures form the basis of any 
development program in a modern society. If the cuts were to 
affect the transport sector, in the medium term we would pay for 
this with a fall in production, trade, and consequently GDP. 
The effect would be a worsening in the public accounts. 
  [Fatone] Do you have faith in [Prime Minister] Berlusconi? 
  [Fiori] Certainly. I find that Berlusconi possesses an 
exceptional lucidity and simplicity in these problems. 
  [Fatone] Have you any suggestions to give to Berlusconi 
concerning the budget? 
  [Fiori] Yes. We can rake in 50 trillion lire without having 
to resort to cuts and new taxes. We will succeed in blocking 
the INPS abyss. 
  [Fatone] And where do you intend getting these 50 trillion 
lire from. 
  [Fiori] I will communicate this at the right moment. First I 
must complete the plan that I will offer to the council of 
ministers. 
  [Fatone] Can you give us a preview of your recipe? 
  [Fiori] I can only say that it concerns four or five items. 
Trust in my words.

<F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Altero Matteoli by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Matteoli: `What Is 
This About a Black, I Am a Real Green'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The only "fascist" thing that has remained 
is the balcony on Piazza Venezia, right in front of the windows 
of his ministerial office. Even Altero Matteoli, [National 
Alliance leader] Fini's political arm in the Berlusconi 
government had to pay the score of being right-wing in a Europe 
that was left-wing before 12 June. However, the pre-election 
controversy, unleashed from abroad by the socialists, ended up 
in a celebration as the current holder of the Environment 
Ministry tells IL GIORNALE for the first time. 
  "It was the Belgian colleague, but not the usual Di Rupo, to 
state his concern over the safeguarding of democracy in a 
`Community country' during the meeting in Luxembourg," reminded 
Matteoli. "When my turn came, I answered as I should have 
answered him. All the more that U.S. President Clinton had just 
met with leading exponents of National Alliance. The British 
minister gave me his solidarity immediately. Then we all went 
to lunch, including the `contester'..." 
  [Guiglia] How can somebody who is against the Greens be an 
environment minister? 
  [Matteoli] He can, of course he can. I have nothing against 
the Greens. Rather, I have good relations with some of them 
because I have been a parliamentarian for four legislatures and 
we have often worked shoulder to shoulder. What I do criticize 
instead is their purely ideological way of facing environmental 
problems. Some see my ministry as being like a bunker, inside 
which I must defend myself in order to say no to everything. 
But how can you do this? The Greens have brought the ecological 
issue to the attention of everybody. This is an undeniable 
historical merit. Today they seem to be like the Northern 
League: They have lost their "propulsive thrust" to change 
after having given an important pushover to the First Republic. 
  [Guiglia] Which are the environmental emergencies of the 
Second Republic? 
  [Matteoli] Coastal erosion, the pollution of the sea and 
rivers. My great bet is making the fish return to the Tiber 
River. The British succeeded with the Thames; we will succeed as 
well. 
  [Guiglia] And what about the Right's challenge to the 
progressive mayor of Italy's capital city? 
  [Matteoli] Let us put it this way, I think that [Rome Mayor] 
Rutelli himself will willingly accept the challenge. You see, 
however, in the past I had already attempted to create a 
parliamentary commission of investigation into the Arno river. 
There was nothing to be done. Now, however, I will return to 
the charge. I am strengthening the NOC. 
  [Guiglia] The what? 
  [Matteoli] NOC, the Operational Nucleus of the Military 
Police. We have about 80 in Rome and seven -- I repeat, seven -- 
in Milan and Naples. I want to upgrade them. I want to discover 
who pollutes the small and larger rivers in Italy and how, 
where, and when they do it. 
  [Guiglia] When there was too much smog the mayors stopped 
the 
traffic circulating on Sundays. Does the minister agree? 
  [Matteoli] It is a fanciful measure. After having induced 
the Italians to buy one or two automobiles per person, we are 
now exhorting them not to use them. The problem lies at the 
source: We need car parks. At least in part, and with other 
measures, they could resolve the matter. 
  [Guiglia] Can nuclear energy return in Italy? 
  [Matteoli] There are contrasting positions in Europe. The 
United Kingdom wants more nuclear power plants, Spain wants 
less. We missed the nuclear energy train 15 years ago. 
Reproposing it today would be useless and outdated, despite the 
merits. However, Italy would do well to continue studies on the 
topic. We spent 17 trillion lire for Montaldo di Castro 
[nuclear power plant].

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Dirk </F>
Hoeren; place and date not given: "We Are in Troubled Waters"] 
  [Text] [Hoeren] The European Union (EU) did not manage to 
agree on a new president for the EU commission at the Corfu 
summit. Is the EU torn by strife? 
  [Kinkel] The summit was no battle. There were different 
opinions on the next president of the EU Commission. Eleven 
states backed Belgian Prime Minister Dehaene, while Britain was 
against him. Now we have to settle this conflict. There is a 
bit of troubled water. This must be calmed. 
  [Hoeren] The British complain that the atmosphere has been 
poisoned, and the Dutch accuse Chancellor Kohl of having fought 
for Dehaene like a bulldozer. 
  [Kinkel] These accusations are completely unjustified. I 
categorically reject them. Some of the tones that were heard 
there are inappropriate and do not serve the cause. Some people 
forget that the issue was not a decision for or against a 
particular person but the best solution for the most important 
European office. I hope very much that the noise on the fringes 
will soon abate. 
  [Hoeren] The British have announced that they will never 
vote for Dehaene.... 
  [Kinkel] It is true that the decision on Jacques Delors' 
successor must be made unanimously. This makes it difficult if 
one country refuses. It will be the first task of the German 
Government in its presidency of the EU council as of 1 July to 
bring the cow off the ice. Chancellor Kohl and I will talk to 
all countries so as to find a solution by the special summit on 
15 July. 
  [Hoeren] What do you think of the compromise suggestion to 
extend Delors' term of office? 
  [Kinkel] Given a ratio of 11:1, it must be possible to find 
a successor. There is no reason to put up a compromise 
candidate. We cannot afford an undignified struggle about 
filling the most important office in Europe. 
  [Hoeren] What are the things that speak for Belgium's 
Dehaene? 
  [Kinkel] He has shown that he is a dedicated European and a 
doer. At this difficult time, the EU needs a doer.

are now available. The turnout on 12 June was 66.07 percent of 
those entitled to vote, of whom 30.13 percent voted for the CDU 
[Christian Democratic Union]. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] 
gained 383,337 votes or 27.94 percent, returning officer 
Paul-Uwe Soeker announced in Magdeburg at the weekend. The PDS 
[Party of Democratic Socialists] gained third place with 18.9 
percent. The FDP [Free Democratic Party] failed to clear the 
five percent hurdle, gaining only 4.71 percent of the votes. 
The Greens were given 77,907 votes or 5.68 percent. The 
Republicans gained 2.77 percent and thus played an insignificant 
role. [passage omitted]

chairman, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, says he is "very 
happy" with his party's performance at the Saxony-Anhalt 
parliamentary election. Looking ahead to the [October] general 
elections, I see reason for optimism, Kohl said after a CDU 
Presidium session in Bonn today. However, the CDU will have to 
continue to fight for every vote.

    [Editorial Report] Mainz ZDF Television Network in German 
at 1730 GMT on 26 June carries a 30-minute program of live 
statements by leading party officials from Bonn to questions by 
ZDF correspondent Klaus-Peter Siegloch on the preliminary result 
of today's Landtag election in Saxony-Anhalt. 
  Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany (SPD), says that he is "more than happy" with 
the preliminary election result, which sees the SPD at about 34 
percent and only marginally behind the Christian Democratic 
Union (CDU). It has been a "brilliant victory" for the SPD, 
which has made "a leap ahead" compared to the election of four 
years ago, but also to the European election of two weeks ago. 
He believes that the SPD congress in Halle and "the convincing 
appearance of Rudolf Scharping" have "boosted" the motivation of 
the voters. This means that "the race for the Bundestag 
election is entirely open again." He emphasizes that the 
CDU/Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) coalition government 
in Saxony-Anhalt has been "chased out" by the voters, thus 
leading to the "worst election defeat" of the past few years 
anywhere in Germany. As far as the Bundestag election is 
concerned, Verheugen says that we, the SPD, "do not want a grand 
coalition." The voters have to make sure that one can establish 
"a reformist alliance against the current government" after the 
October election. 
  CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze argues that, since the 
CDU 
is ahead of the other parties, this is "a very nice success." 
He praises the work of new Minister President Bergner, who was 
elected minister president only six months ago after his 
predecessor resigned and whose "hard work has been honored by 
the voters." The "second reason" for the good result is that 
"the positive trend at the federal level has continued." He 
praises Chancellor Kohl's great efforts in the CDU's election 
campaign in Saxony-Anhalt. Hintze says that today's election was 
"not a test election" and that "it is clear" that the Bundestag 
election in October has not been won yet. Nevertheless, today's 
victory "was another important step." 
  FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer admits that the election 
result, in which support for his party plummeted from 
approximately 14 percent in 1990 to under 4 percent today, has 
been a "debacle." He blames the result partly to the "poor 
relations" between the FDP group in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag 
and the party's Land Executive Committee, something the 
"citizens have not forgotten." He says that the result will 
"certainly" have its consequences. He also points to the fact 
that the result clearly reflects a rejection of a coalition 
between the SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. The FDP now has to go 
into the Bundestag election and the remaining Landtag elections 
with "more solidarity." As far as a possible grand coalition 
after the next Bundestag election in Bonn is concerned, Hoyer 
says that this would be a "disaster for the FRG." This is why 
the FDP will and can fulfill "a central function" in the 
Bundestag election. 
  Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism 
(PDS) Bundestag group, which scored some 19 percent in today's 
poll, says that the "stabilization" of his party makes him "very 
secure" and "optimistic" also for the Bundestag election in 
October. Gysi says that the "national front" that was 
established against the PDS has "failed." This means that "the 
parties must learn to treat us differently than they have done 
so far." He says that in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag there is now 
a "clear majority left of the CDU and the FDP" and adds that the 
PDS would be "ready" to "tolerate a coalition government between 
the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens." If the SPD were to prefer a 
grand coalition, then this is the SPD's "problem, not ours." 
Nevertheless, a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU 
would "not" be a "catastrophe" for him. 
  Marianne Birthler, spokeswoman for the Alliance 90/Greens, 
which won just over 5 percent of the vote, believes that the 
party's "still very weak structures" in eastern Germany are 
partly responsible for the result, which is not as good as 
expected. Moreover, the "potential" of voters for "clear 
ecological and civil rights policy" as "offered" by her party is 
weaker in eastern Germany than at the federal level. With 
regard to the good result of the PDS, Birthler says that the 
people know "what they do not want" but that they are still "far 
from knowing what they do want." 
  Christian Social Union (CSU) Secretary General Erwin Huber 
stresses the necessity for all "democratic parties" to "even 
step up the fight" against the "left-wing extremist" and 
"communist" PDS. Huber believes, though, that in the Bundestag 
election, the voters will "vote differently." 
  At the end, all officials express their disappointment at 
the 
low voter turnout in the Saxony-Anhalt election, which fell to 
some 54 percent.

    [Editorial Report] Mainz ZDF Television Network in German 
at 1705 GMT on 26 June in its "Heute" program carries 10 minutes 
of live statements by leading party officials of Saxony-Anhalt 
to questions by ZDF correspondent Barbara Friedrichs on the 
preliminary results of today's Landtag election, which give the 
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 35 percent of the vote, the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) 34 percent, the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) 3.7 percent, the Party of 
Democratic Socialism (PDS) 19 percent, the Greens 5.1 percent, 
and the Republikaner 1.3 percent. 
  Minister President Christoph Bergner (CDU) describes the 
result as "relatively positive." "For me it is important that 
we have stuck to our political course," which is what was 
honored by the voters. He expresses his thanks to those who 
supported the CDU, adding that he was "sure" that the support 
from Bonn in the election was important. "I have the impression 
that the support by the federal chancellor was most effective 
here" compared to the appearances of other party leaders from 
Bonn in the Saxony-Anhalt election campaign. 
  Asked about a possible grand coalition, which now seems the 
only possibility for a new government since both the CDU and the 
SPD ruled out a coalition with the PDS even before the election, 
Bergner says that the current "constellation" is "not very 
good." He does, however, support coalition talks with the SPD, 
"and then we will see how easy or difficult this is going to be." 
  Reinhard Hoeppner, chairman of the SPD group in the 
Saxony-Anhalt Landtag, argues that coalition talks with the CDU 
will not be easy since there are "a number of essential 
differences" between the two parties. "The decisive thing," 
however is "to advance the country." He is optimistic that his 
party will "overcome" the "difficult constellation." He is "not 
particularly happy" about the apparently inevitable grand 
coalition with the CDU, and adds that he is still "worrying" 
about the fact that the Greens will be represented in the new 
Landtag. Hoeppner then says: "I have my doubts whether it 
would be good for the development of democracy in our country if 
the PDS were the only opposition party." The SPD official notes 
that, compared to the European election, "we have increased" our 
share in the vote again. 
  Peter Kunert, chairman of the FDP group of Saxony-Anhalt, 
which lost more than 10 percentage points from the 1990 results, 
and will not be represented in the new Landtag, blames the poor 
result on the "negative trend" in which his party has been for 
some time. "The voters did not honor" the FDP's work in 
Saxony-Anhalt, and we will have to "analyze" the result. He 
does "not rule out" personal consequences. 
  Petra Sitte, chairwoman of the PDS group in the Landtag, 
says 
that her party's good result has "certainly" nothing to do with 
a "nostalgia for the GDR," as suggested by the ZDF 
correspondent. The high score is partly due to the "protest" by 
the electorate, but she also believes that "the PDS has been 
recognized" as an opposition power. "I also think that building 
a coalition against the PDS, as was tried in the past few days, 
has not worked out." She adds that "for us, political 
responsibility also means responsibility as opposition." 
  Heidrun Heidecke, spokeswoman for Alliance 90/Greens, argues 
that the result "clearly shows" that the reformist forces in 
Saxony-Anhalt are "not as strong as in the old laender." 
Nevertheless, one must not forget that Alliance 90/Greens is 
still "a young party." She assumes that her party can continue 
its work in the opposition in the next four years and will be 
able to set its own "accents."

  [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Guenter Verheugen, the Social 
Democratic Party's [SPD] federal business manager, has described 
the result of the state elections in Saxony-Anhalt as a 
"brilliant success" for the Social Democrats. The race for 
victory in the federal elections on 16 October is "wide open 
again," Verheugen said in Bonn this evening. Anyone who thinks 
that the SPD is already down and out has now been "taught a 
lesson," he said. 
  Verheugen stressed that the SPD is the "clear victor" of the 
election in Saxony-Anhalt. The government of Minister-President 
Christoph Bergner [Christian Democratic Union -- CDU] has been 
"voted out," he said. Verheugen pointed to the "dramatic 
losses" of the coalition partners CDU and Free Democratic Party 
[FDP]. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping was also pleased that the 
Social Democrats in Saxony-Anhalt have achieved such a brilliant 
result. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the FDP's losses, Verheugen said the party is 
paying the price for its "fraternization" with the CDU.

  [Text] Magdeburg (DDP/ADN) -- Lothar Bisky, leader of the 
Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], described his party's 
performance in the Saxony Anhalt state elections as another step 
by the PDS in the direction of the Bundestag. Commenting on the 
most recent computer predictions, which show the Socialist Unity 
Party's successor party as the third-strongest party with 18 
percent of the vote, Bisky told journalists that Saxony Anhalt 
shows that "people in the east want us." Despite really massive 
threats in recent weeks, the voters did not allow themselves to 
be confused, he said, adding that this is a good thing and gives 
him confidence for the federal elections. The PDS is aiming for 
at least three first-past-the-post seats, and thus entry into 
the federal parliament, Bisky said.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The federal leadership of the Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] has frankly conceded its severe defeat in 
the Saxony Anhalt state elections. FDP General Secretary Werner 
Hoyer described the result here this evening as an "electoral 
disaster" and "a bitter moment for the Liberals." What is 
needed now above all is to give FDP members enough motivation 
for the forthcoming state and federal elections, he said. 
According to Hoyer, the reasons for the result lie in "the poor 
image of the federal FDP as a whole" and also in certain special 
reasons regarding the FDP in Saxony-Anhalt.

  [Text] Nuremberg (DDP/ADN) -- Theo Waigel, chairman of the 
CSU [Christian Social Union], has again sharply attacked the 
SED's [Socialist Unity Party] successor party, the PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialists]. Waigel told the regional conference of 
the Bavarian Young Union [CSU's youth organization] here today 
that the "criminal SED/PDS" ought to be "turfed out of the 
parliaments." 
  "If we do not tolerate former Nazis or neo-Nazis in 
politics, 
then we should not tolerate any former communists or 
neocommunists," the head of the CSU said. He is not, he said, 
fighting against the Republicans' leader Franz Schoenhuber so 
that "a Mr. Gysi [leader of PDS] can travel from talk show to 
talk show." 
  Just as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU ruled out 
any cooperation with the far-right Republicans, so it should 
distance itself from the PDS as well, Waigel said.

<F P=106> ["Nm"-signed editorial: "On Corfu"] </F>
  [Text] What was signed on Corfu, Greece's "green island," 
on the first day of the European Council has quite a lot to do 
with the principle of hope. For example, the partnership 
agreement with Moscow: Whether Russia will one day be part of 
the European free trade zone depends on its political 
developments in the next few years. If, in the Russian power 
struggle, the forces of the bureaucratic-military-industrial 
complex hold their own -- Prime Minister Chernomyrdin belongs to 
this group -- then the agreement with the European Union [EU] 
will not materialize. Yeltsin's short visit to Corfu would then 
remain another attempt to boost the Russian president's image, 
which is declining at home, through international support 
actions. 
  The principle of hope also stands behind the signatures, 
which seal the EU's "northern enlargement," at least at the 
official government level. The matter with Austria, where the 
citizens voted in favor of accession with a surprisingly large 
majority, seems to be the only issue genuinely settled thus far. 
In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, party majorities have spoken 
out "in favor of Europe" recently; however, the voters have not 
been asked yet. In Norway, in particular, it is more than 
dubious whether the people will follow the advice of Prime 
Minister Brundtland, who is not tiring in her struggle for 
membership. Their small chance is based on the fact that the 
Norwegians will be the last ones to hold a referendum, on 28 
November, and might be scared of becoming isolated in case their 
Swedish and Finnish neighbors vote in favor of accession first. 
  The heads of government are dealing with a long agenda on 
Corfu. At the top of it is the decision on who will succeed 
French Commission President Delors; on such issues, the 
political microcosmos tends to turn on its own axis at a high 
speed. What is more important is that, by establishing a 
preparatory group for the 1996 government conference, the EU 
will embark on its path toward "Maastricht II." Germany and 
France, which will now assume the presidency in the EU in 
succession, are expected to provide decisive impulses: In view 
of the election campaigns in the two countries, one can only 
count on the principle of hope here, too.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Thorsten Widow: "Inconsistent Liking of the </F>
German Mark"] 
  [Text] Anyone relying on traditional indicators to explain 
the movements of the currency markets will have a problem at the 
moment. Thus, several reasons could be found why the dollar 
should gain rather than lose in value, at least against the 
German mark. Purchasing power and the upswing of the U.S. 
economy are just two of them. But the reality is different. 
The dollar is preparing for a downward move. Why do the 
relevant economic comparisons at best serve as counterindicators 
of the exchange rate forecast? Why is the German mark gaining 
against almost all currencies -- except for the Swiss franc and 
the yen -- without leaving any corresponding traces on the 
German share and bond markets? 
  Since the spring of 1994 at the latest, a new, technical, 
code of conduct has established itself in the foreign exchange 
markets. Inspired by the then successful concerted interventions 
of the central banks, an increasing number of investors have 
betted on this horse. They hope for, and expect, measures 
supporting the dollar, also in the future. To make this a 
profitable strategy, most of the investment firms use the 
charter analysis, which indicates support points visible to 
everyone. At these points, whether they are at 1.6250 or 1.60 
German marks [DM], the participators in the market enter into 
dollar positions, because in anticipation of central bank 
interventions they consider themselves to be on the right side. 
But if such joint activities fail to take place, the U.S. 
currency drops due to profit-reducing stop-loss orders. This 
pattern also emerged over the past week and a half, and, 
retrospectively, it is very well known from crises in the 
European Monetary System. 
  The psychological aspect cannot be overlooked. What is 
particularly surprising is that supposed interventions are 
thought to have such a strong effect. There have been several 
examples in the past where administrative interventions in the 
foreign currency markets failed badly. The volumes moved and 
the symbolic value of interventions were too low. But probably 
the "softening job" by the central banks is successful, who 
"threaten" banks that they are constantly ready for 
interventions. In addition, the U.S. currency has dropped to 
its October 1993 level. The DM1.60 currently paid against the 
dollar is the lower limit of the range in which the dollar has 
moved since the beginning of 1993 (upper limit: DM1.76). To 
interpret this as willingness to intervene would be wrong only 
if one were to ignore that almost everyone thinks that way, and 
acts accordingly. In this connection, the question as to who is 
interested in a more stable dollar easily becomes less 
important. On closer examination, the German Bundesbank should 
not have any problems with the current value of the dollar, and 
it would certainly only become active out of loyalty to the 
Federal Reserve. Exchange rates of around DM1.60 are still 
acceptable to the German export industry, and they promote the 
stability of prices. The fact is that so far there have not 
been any warnings on the part of industry. 
  The Federal Reserve, however, is torn between fears of 
inflation on the one hand and foreign trade considerations on 
the other. If it were to call for dollar purchases 
internationally, this would mean putting its cards on the table 
in a risky manner. Should the interventions fail to achieve a 
lasting effect, which is not unlikely in view of the 
increasingly pessimistic mood toward the dollar, an increase in 
key interest rates would be absolutely necessary to halt the 
drop of the dollar. In the current year, this strategy has not 
proved successful, although the Bundesbank simultaneously lent a 
helping hand with its relaxation tactics. 
  The fact that the ailing dollar is not reflected by price 
increases in German shares is another phenomenon that has a 
touch of novelty about it. The loss of a positive correlation 
between fixed currencies and rising share indexes makes one 
wonder about the suggested market development. Where are the 
German marks that have been purchased by international 
addresses? As prospects are rated as poor in both shares and 
bonds, the funds have found their temporary destiny in the 
DM-capital market. The feared exchange rate losses in 
traditional shares are not set off by a sufficient compensation 
through the desired currency profits. In view of the latest 
dynamic downward movement of the Dax and Bund futures, this 
scenario is unlikely to change fundamentally in the near future. 
Nevertheless, an enormous investment potential of German marks 
has formed, which will sooner or later want to achieve higher 
yields than those available in the capital market, all the more 
so as the German short-term interest rate does not seem to have 
reached its lowest point yet. Only then would the world of the 
fundamental analysts be in order.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis has said that he 
learned in Corfu that the European Union [EU] intends, once 
certain difficulties are overcome concerning the accession of a 
new group of countries, for Cyprus and Malta to be included in 
that group. In a statement at Larnaca Airport after his return 
to Cyprus, President Kliridhis said these difficulties are not 
concerned with the Cyprus problem but with internal EU issues. 
  Referring to developments in the Cyprus issue, President 
Kliridhis reiterated that the Greek side is adhering to the 21 
March document and does not accept anything done after that at 
consultations held without its participation. President 
Kliridhis further said that he found understanding from his 
interlocutors in Corfu that there should be progress with regard 
to both the substance of the Cyprus issue and the 
confidence-building measures. 
  Regarding his meeting in Athens with the Greek National 
Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, President Kliridhis said he 
was fully briefed on Mr. Arsenis' contacts in Washington. 
Kliridhis noted: The United States never raised any questions 
about the Greece-Cyprus defense doctrine.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis described the 
Corfu Summit decision, by which Cyprus will definitely join the 
European Union [EU] in the next expansion phase, as a great 
success for Cyprus. In a written statement tonight, 
Mikhailidhis added that with the Corfu Summit, Cyprus is now 
entering the course for joining United Europe. He added that 
the decision is not merely a step forward, but a decisive step 
because, as he stressed, the only thing that remains is setting 
a date for the beginning of accession negotiations. 
  The foreign minister said it is significant that, for the 
first time, Cyprus is referred to by linking it to EU expansion, 
and not by mentioning the existing political problem. 
Mikhailidhis stressed that this is a great success for Cyprus, 
and reinforces the Cypriot people's hopes and expectations for a 
better and safer future within the EU. The foreign minister 
expressed Cyprus' gratitude toward the European Council for 
making the decision and toward the Greek Government, 
particularly the Greek delegation that successfully waged the 
great battle.

  [Text] Responding to a question by the Cyprus Broadcasting 
Corporation correspondent, Greek Foreign Ministry Secretary 
General Ioannis Kranidhiotis said the Greek Presidency's 
proposal was for negotiations to begin and conclude before the 
1996 intergovernment conference, and then Cyprus would join the 
European Union [EU] after the conference. 
  Kranidhiotis said the proposal was removed during the 
discussion. Objections were mainly raised by France, which wants 
the institutional operational framework to be set first; 
Germany, which links the issue with Turkey; and Britain, which 
links the issue with progress in the Cyprus issue. The 
secretary general added that what we have achieved is that the 
next expansion phase will certainly include Cyprus and Malta. 
He said what is more important is that Cyprus' accession is no 
longer linked to developments in the Cyprus issue. He concluded 
that the issue of beginning accession negotiations will be 
raised many times before 1996 in order to achieve a commitment 
for the beginning of negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has sent a 
letter to European Commission President Jacques Delors demanding 
that efforts to promote Cyprus' application for membership in 
the European Union [EU] be stopped. According to I SIMERINI's 
information, in an effort to prevent this, the occupation leader 
sent a letter on the eve of the Corfu Summit (its work concluded 
yesterday) asking outright that all activities surrounding the 
Cypriot application be stopped. 
  Well-informed sources told I SIMERINI that Denktas mentioned 
in his letter to the European Commission president that "for the 
first time in 30 years, the Cyprus issue has come very close to 
a solution." Denktas said it is a shame to undermine this 
effort through such activities (by promoting the application). 
At the same time, Denktas again questioned the legitimacy of 
the Republic of Cyprus, claiming that it does not represent the 
entire population. 
  In any case, Denktas called on the Turkish Cypriots to cause 
unrest according to the TMT [Turkish Resistance Organization] 
system, and prevent Cyprus' accession to the EU at all costs, 
because something like this would mean that the island was being 
hellenized. 
  The entire effort of the Turkish side has recently focused 
on 
creating a "good impression" of its intentions toward the Cyprus 
issue. This was done by sending messages to the European 
leaders, not the Security Council, in an effort to prevent 
Cyprus' application from moving forward. At first glance, it 
does not appear that the Turkish efforts have succeeded, because 
the EU decided to include Cyprus in its next expansion. On the 
other hand, it is believed that the Turkish side will use the 
accession issue persistently and coercively during the process 
of resolving the Cyprus issue. 
  The Turkish side, especially Ankara, which has the 
capability 
to intervene diplomatically, demanded that UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali issue a supplementary report during the 
Corfu Summit, something that did not happen. The contents of 
the letter (the supplementary report will be in the form of a 
letter) will satisfy the Turkish side. On the other hand, 
current efforts mainly aim at finding a formula to keep the 
confidence-building measures permanently on the negotiating 
table and also to satisfy President Glavkos Kliridhis on other 
points. 
  I SIMERINI's information is that a British intervention is 
expected on the Cyprus issue, which will consider that the 
United States has failed (just like the United Nations) in its 
efforts. The entire British philosophy will be based on creating 
conditions for a discussion on various aspects to find a 
commonly accepted procedure. This will be achieved at meetings 
with both sides (Butrus-Ghali's fourth option). There might 
also be a preparation (fifth option) with the arrival of the 
Security Council representatives for talks.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis described as a big 
success the decision by the European Union [EU] summit in Corfu 
to include Cyprus in the Union's next expansion. President 
Kliridhis expressed Cyprus' thanks for the Greek presidency's 
action, which resulted in this success, and referred 
specifically to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias, and Alternate Foreign Minister 
Theodhoros Pangalos. 
  Referring to a statement by Rauf Denktas on blocking Cyprus' 
course toward the EU, President Kliridhis said the Turkish 
Cypriot leader speaks irrationally when he talks about blocking 
the course and about a struggle in the spirit of the terrorist 
organization TMT [Turkish Resistance Organization].

  [Text] In a written statement read to reporters this 
morning by Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis, President 
Glavkos Kliridhis says he is not considering any cabinet 
reshuffle and adds that he fully trusts his ministers. 
  Commenting on press reports that he is looking for someone 
to 
replace Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Kliridhis says he 
fully trusts Mikhailidhis. He adds: The foreign minister has 
played an important role--both general and specific--on the 
confidence-building measures and our efforts to promote 
membership in the European Union. The foreign minister's 
meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has 
appropriately prepared the ground for my own meeting with Hurd. 
  Asked if press reports are harming the foreign minister's 
image, the government spokesman replied: I believe the 
statement that I have just read restores the foreign minister's 
image if it was harmed by the press reports. 
  Asked to comment on the press reports, Mikhailidhis referred 
to Kliridhis' statement, adding that the government has a lot of 
work to do and is not disturbed by press reports. He noted that 
the newspapers might have their own reasons for carrying such 
reports.

<F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>
  [Text] Today or tomorrow UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali will send the Security Council an official letter 
praising the Turkish side. According to informed sources, the 
letter will constitute a supplement (upon a Turkish request) to 
the UN secretary general's latest report and will note the 
progress achieved in the talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN 
secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, 
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas after 30 May. The letter 
will mainly be based on a report prepared by Joe Clark, the UN 
secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, following 
his recent visit to the island and will be as important as an 
official document. Because the events will be listed, the 
clarifications and positions raised by Denktas in his meetings 
with the United Nations will be given official status. Despite 
Nicosia's objection, the submission of the letter will certainly 
mean that the procedure is continuing. 
  From there the Security Council will make decisions on the 
Cyprus issue. Obviously, at least behind the scenes, the 
British will proceed to "marry," promote, two of the options 
included in Butrus-Ghali's latest report. Reliable circles say 
the British element -- having long left the initiative to the 
United States -- will attempt to undertake an initiative on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  Analyzing developments and the facts in the Cyprus issue, 
the 
Foreign Office believes that no move must force President 
Glavkos Kliridhis to "reject" the procedure that will be 
formulated. Clark already received a negative reply when he 
asked the president to agree to incorporate the Vienna 
agreements in the 21 March UN document. In their own interests, 
as usual the British will try to find a formula that will be 
accepted both by Kliridhis and Denktas. 
  How will they proceed? A diplomatic source noted yesterday 
that according to all the signs the "five" are being oriented in 
promoting a formula that will keep the confidence-building 
measures on the negotiating table and at the same time begin a 
long-term discussion of the Cyprus issue. The same source 
mentioned that signs are being reinforced that the Security 
Council believes every move is made on the basis of 
Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas and the confidence-building 
measures. They claim there is 90 percent agreement on the 
confidence-building measures. 
  The Turkish side has launched a large-scale diplomatic 
campaign abroad to convey the idea that Denktas accepts the 
confidence-building measures. The reality is this: The 
military officers, the National Security Council, recently 
confirmed a decision to remain "open" on the Cyprus issue. The 
orders that have been given insist that a policy be followed on 
a political level to show that the Turkish side is contributing 
positively to developments. This is why Denktas, who has 
recently been calling on Turkey (obviously for advice), must 
give "yes" and "no" answers to the mediators. The current 
Turkish strategy dictates that many fronts must be kept open 
with Greece. 
  All that is certain is that the UN Security Council will 
decide on the next steps within the next few days. The 
substance of the decision is known to an extent. The question 
is how to express it, because it requires a positive reply from 
both sides.

  [Text] The joint Cyprus-Greek military maneuvers will be 
held in October within the framework of the unified defense 
doctrine. According to CyBC's [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] 
exclusive information, the Greek Air Force and Navy will 
participate in the exercise. The decision to hold the exercise 
was made during the recent visit and talks in Athens by Defense 
Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis. It is possible that this 
exercise will be combined with the National Guard annual 
maneuvers codenamed Nikiforos. 
  A group of staffers are working on the exercise plans, which 
are expected to be ready in August and everything will proceed 
on the basis of what has been agreed upon in Athens. Military 
sources have told CyBC that the communications sector is 
considered particularly important for the success of the 
exercise as well as for the unified defense doctrine in general. 
According to the same sources, direct communications with 
parallel safeguards for confidentiality are also being studied. 
  According to CyBC information, all the diplomatic missions 
both in Nicosia and in Athens have demonstrated particular 
interest in the exercise.

<F P=106> [Report by Alekos Konis] </F>
  [Text] Larnaca, (I SIMERINI Office)--After the recent 
incident at Larnaca Airport, where aircraft movements were under 
surveillance, a new act of espionage against the security of 
Cyprus took place last Wednesday afternoon [22 June] in a 
sensitive military area of Larnaca. 
  According to our information, last Wednesday afternoon a 
National Guard patrol caught red-handed a British military 
police corporal stationed at the British base at Dhekelia while 
he was making notes on a topography map in an area next to 
National Guard minefields west of the British base and south of 
Pyla village. 
  The British serviceman had a compass in his possession, 
which 
he apparently used to locate accurately the exact geographic 
position of the minefields and the passages through them by 
enemy forces toward the territory of the Republic of Cyprus. 
  The British serviceman protested his arrest and there was an 
incident with the national guardsmen. 
  The Englishman was finally arrested by the police. After 
giving a statement in which he attempted to justify his actions 
and the annotating of a map, he was released and handed over to 
the authorities of the British base. 
  The actions of the police action remain inexplicable, 
however; according to our information, they released the 
Englishman without the consent of the military authorities and 
the National Guard General Staff. The Briton's surname is Lee 
[name published in English]. The police returned the compass 
and map he was using, and an attempt was made to hush up an 
event that is considered one of the most serious cases against 
the security of the Republic of Cyprus in recent years.

  [Text] Joe Clark completed his lightning visit to Cyprus 
yesterday declaring that "there is no change in the situation to 
report." 
  This means that [Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf] Denktas 
continues to reject the final U.N. paper on the confidence 
building measures of March 21, which has been described by the 
U.N. Secretary-General as fair and balanced and as offering 
advantages to both sides. 
  Clark's visit was clearly the result of the intense pressure 
exerted by Washington and London to resolve the deadlock and so 
avert the adoption of the U.N. Secretary-General's report which 
blames the "lack of political will" by the Turkish side for the 
failure of the talks. 
  Despite the clearcut conclusion of Butrus Butrus-Ghali the 
British and the Americans continue to credit Denktas with the 
will to reach an agreement. The point is, what kind of 
agreement? Clearly not the one hammered out by the U.N. 
officials as a compromise, which no matter how painful and 
controversial, has been accepted as is by President Glavkos 
Kliridhis as yet another sacrifice by the Greek Cypriot side for 
the sake of reaching an agreement as long last. 
  The Turkish side, however, is clearly not satisfied with the 
occupation of north Cyprus, the expulsion of the Greek Cypriot 
population through a major ethnic cleansing operation, and the 
illegal usurpation of the refugees' properties. 
  It has the effrontery not only to mock the Security Council 
by refusing to implement any of its numerous resolutions on 
Cyprus, but insists in effect on the legitimisation of its 
criminal actions. 
  The tragedy of the Cyprus story is that the major powers, 
particularly the United States, acting on the basis of its own 
global interests, and the once-upon-a-time imperial Britain, 
which is only too happy to see the continuation of the island's 
division, even through it is a guarantor of its territorial 
integrity and independence, both refuse to sanction any action 
that would force Turkey to behave. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd declared this week 
that there was a chance of "decisive progress," adding that the 
stone has been pushed almost to the top of the mountain and 
should not be allowed to roll down again. 
  Would this were truly so. Regretfully, as President 
Kliridhis pointed out yesterday, the differences, resulting from 
the Turkish rejection of the U.N. document are substantial, and 
"becoming worse," as a result of the insatiable appetite of the 
Turkish side to ask for more and more, which keeps growing as 
long as the Security Council continues to take no action to see 
that its resolutions do not remain hollow words. 
  As Kliridhis pointed out in connection with Hurd's 
assessment 
that agreement was so close, why doesn't the British minister 
then persuade Denktas to accept the "fair and balanced" March 21 
document? 
  It remains to be seen now whether the Security Council will, 
finally, take a stand, by closing the long-drawn-out efforts by 
successive secretary-generals of the U.N., which have led 
nowhere due to the lack of political will by the Turkish side, 
and at long last demand that Turkey implements the U.N. 
resolutions on Cyprus without further delay. 
  If the Council succumbs to Anglo-American pressure, as it 
has 
been doing ever since the 1974 invasion, and once more chooses 
to do nothing concrete, ignoring Butrus-Ghali's call for the 
adoption of alternative ways, Cyprus will be left with no option 
but to rethink its strategy and tactics which have so far been 
based solely on the clearly pointless U.N.-sponsored negotiation.

<F P=106> [Report by Kira Adham] </F>
  [Text] During the recent visit to the U.S. Pentagon and 
State Department by National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, 
the Greek Government seemed immovable in its position on the 
sovereign rights in the Aegean, but with the intention for 
closer cooperation with the United States at a bilateral as well 
as collective level. 
  The aim of Arsenis' visit was to moderate the pressure that 
Washington had exerted recently on the Aegean issue and, at the 
same time, to transfer the U.S. interest's center of gravity 
from the Greek-Turkish disputes in the Aegean to the prospects 
for closer Greek-U.S. cooperation in the Balkan region at a 
bilateral level as well as within NATO. 
  Concerning the Greek-Turkish disputes, Arsenis raised the 
issue for discussion with his U.S. counterpart William 
Perry--since the initiative for discussion of other issues was 
taken by the U.S. side--in order to explain that the Turkish 
violations and infringements in the Aegean airspace are taking 
place with the Turkish side overstepping the 1988 Vouliagmeni 
official memorandum and that the Greek fighter planes, on the 
basis of NATO regulations and instructions for "area 41" which 
is covered by Greece as a member of the alliance, are obliged to 
be armed. 
  The U.S. officials, according to the Greek side's 
impression, 
did not put further pressure on this issue but did not show that 
they changed their views either. It is indicative that in its 
"corrective" statement the State Department insists on its 
objection to the 10 nautical miles in the Aegean airspace, 
adding its reservations on the Turkish violations and 
infringements. The State Department, however, at first glance 
"harder" than the Pentagon, transferred the Greek-Turkish issue 
to the sea, insisting that Greece must virtually irrevocably 
disavow its right to extend its territorial waters from the 
present 6 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. The U.S. 
officials, outlining in the discussion the "Turkish fears," 
insisted that as "a gesture of goodwill" Athens must disavow 
this right as of November, when the new Law of the Sea goes into 
effect and which recognizes the right of a state to extend its 
territorial waters to 12 nautical miles and that the islands 
have their own continental shelf. (Turkey has not signed this 
agreement.) 
  During the visit one could not fail to get the impression 
that Turkey still is given privileged treatment concerning U.S. 
military aid. Athens, which is now "being drowned" by a debt of 
$6 billion for U.S. military aid (as against Turkey which 
receives 60 percent of the aid free), asked that either part of 
the debt be converted into free aid or the interest on the debt 
($2 billion) be let off for as long as Turkey receives free aid. 
  However, while the Greek proposals were not rejected but 
were 
met with skepticism, it has been learned that Turkey will 
purchase 10 air refueling aircraft, KC-135 air tankers [last 
three words in English] that had been withdrawn from action, at 
a cost of $0.5 billion but the kind of transaction has not as 
yet been clarified. It is interesting that the introductory 
report maintains that Turkey must remain a strong military force 
since it plays a role in the Balkans, Middle East, Asia, and 
primarily because Turkey participates in operations of the UN 
peace forces and could use the "tankers" in Bosnia "alleviating" 
the U.S. Air Force. 
  At any rate, Mr. Arsenis' "secret card" at the U.S. Pentagon 
was Greece's intention to cooperate with the United States 
within the NATO framework in developing the Partnership for 
Peace (PFP) initiative regarding the Balkans. This intention 
for bilateral cooperation within the NATO framework came at the 
right time (Mr. Perry will begin a visit on this issue to 
Bucharest, Sofia, Skopje, and Tirana) and it seems that it will 
materialize on 19 July when Mr. Perry visits Athens. 
  Thus, the Greek National Defense Ministry primarily shows 
Greece's intention to stop being an "inactive" NATO member and 
to participate actively in the Alliance's new plans, which also 
include the Balkans. So, this "upgrades" Greece's candidacy to 
host the headquarters of the NATO Multinational Rapid Deployment 
Force while the question of military commands becomes a 
secondary issue.

  [Text] Opposition parties commented negatively on the Greek 
Presidency and the European Union [EU] summit. Correspondent 
Dinos Rodhopoulos reports: 
  [Begin recording] In a statement, New Democracy [ND] 
stressed 
that the failure to elect a new European Commission president 
sealed the conclusion of the Corfu summit and confirmed that the 
six-month Greek Presidency was a missed opportunity, since it 
developed into a presidency of simple management and concluded 
with wishes and vague promises. 
  Government Spokesman Ioannis Venizelos described the ND 
statement as a monument of ignorance, cheapness, and timidity. 
He stressed that it was issued even before the conclusions of 
the EU summit were announced. The spokesman noted that if ND 
Chairman Miltiadhis Evert had demonstrated an elementary 
national and European responsibility, he would have at least 
waited to hear the statements of the state and government 
leaders and would have heard about the praise for the Greek 
Presidency, and the developments regarding the election of the 
new European Commission president due to British Prime Minister 
John Major's stance. 
  Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras said in Rethimnon 
that there has been absolutely no progress for our country in 
the Corfu Summit and that the government waved goodbye to the 
great opportunity it had to promote its national issues and the 
problems of the Greek farmers. 
  In a statement, the Greek Communist Party stressed that the 
Greek Presidency is tremendously and historically responsible 
for the pan-European sounding of the antilabor raid that was 
decided in Corfu, noting that all the antipopular, antilabor 
demands of the multinational capital were approved. [end

<F P=106> [Monika Naerr report: "Attitude Vis-a-Vis Macedonia </F>
Appreciated"] 
  [Excerpt] Athens -- Immediately before the European Union 
[EU] summit began in Corfu, President Thomas Klestil and Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock met with Greek President Konstandinos 
Karamanlis in Athens on Thursday [23 June]. Above all, 
Karamanlis stressed that he appreciates Austria's position on 
the Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] issue. 
  Karamanlis welcomed Austria as a new EU member and expressed 
joy about the fact that the agreement came about under the Greek 
EU presidency. 
  He underlined the intensified cooperation between Austria 
and 
Greece, mentioning Austria's commitment in Cyprus in particular. 
  After comprehensive talks on the situation in the Balkans, 
Karamanlis explicitly pointed out that Austria's position on 
Macedonia is being followed with great interest and appreciated 
by Athens. This includes Austria's call for the 
nonestablishment of diplomatic relations, the clear support for 
consular relations, and Macedonia's recognition via joint UN 
membership. 
  Moreover, Austria's traffic policy is in Greece's interest 
over the long term. Greece also wants to shift traffic from the 
"road to the railway." 
  Foreign Minister Alois Mock stressed that the clear outcome 
of the referendum, in which 66 percent of the Austrians 
supported the European Union, grants Austria a special position. 
  In the evening, President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor 
Franz 
Vranitzky participated in a dinner for Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, which was hosted by the EU heads of state and 
government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem </F>
Sanberk by Tahir Yilmaz in Ankara on 26 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Yilmaz] Sir, after your contacts in the United 
States, you flew to Baghdad. What is the latest situation? 
  [Sanberk] We went there to bring closer together the basis 
of the UN Security Council resolutions and the common ground 
established during our previous visit to Baghdad. This time, 
the Iraqi officials, mainly Tariq 'Aziz, moved closer toward 
certain points of the general framework drawn up by the United 
Nations. In other words, we were able to bring the issue inside 
that framework as much as possible. 
  There were two main problems: One was the need to make a 
contribution to the UN compensation fund; the second was the 
trust fund. This time, the Iraqi officials declared that they 
agree to contribute to both funds. In this way, two important 
difficulties were overcome. Preparations will now be made in 
New York for a draft resolution. 
  [Yilmaz] Can you tell us when the pipeline will be flushed? 
  [Sanberk] It would be wrong to give a date, because it may 
not happen on that date. We believe it will happen within a 
short period of time, because the major difficulties have been 
overcome. Do not forget that all the difficulties, however, have 
not been overcome yet. It may take one month; it may take more. 
It is impossible to say at this time.

  [Text] Ankara--Acutely aware of Turkey's growing need for 
natural gas, President Suleyman Demirel declared on Monday [20 
June] that he would personally hold talks with his Iranian 
counterpart regarding building of a pipeline that would 
transport Turkmen gas to Europe via Turkey and Iran. 
  Demirel's announcement of Turco-Iranian talks on the 
pipeline 
followed his request to Turkmenistan President Saparmurat 
Niyazov to "start the natural gas pipeline project as soon as 
possible." 
  Receiving Turkmenistan's Saparmurat Niyazov, who changed his 
name to Turkmenbasi--meaning the Head of the Turkmens--Demirel 
said that Ankara and Ashgabat had reiterated the mutual will to 
build this natural gas pipeline via Turkey. The bilateral talks 
mainly concentrated on economic cooperation in general and 
possible joint projects to develop and operate Turkmen natural 
gas reserves and construction of the pipeline in particular. 
  Turkmenistan recently agreed to the transfer of its natural 
gas to Italy and France through Iran and Turkey with a 5,000 
kilometer (3,000-mile) pipeline. The 9 billion dollar project 
also calls for another, 1,800-kilometer (1,125-mile) pipeline to 
provide Turkey's and Iran's natural gas needs. 
  "We will be the transit point and the buyer at the same 
time," Hayrettin Uzun, the chief of Turkish state pipeline 
company Botas, said before the official talks. 
  But he complained about the slow progress on the 
multi-billion dollar project. 
  A final decision on the pipeline is expected at a meeting 
between Turkey, Russia, Turkmenistan and Iran, chaired by 
Niyazov himself, which will take place on August 15 in Tehran. 
But Demirel said he would take up the issue with his Iranian 
counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati [as published] when he paid a 
visit to Iran on July 25. 
  "We want the project to be realized as soon as possible," 
Demirel told Niyazov, after signing a memorandum of 
understanding. "It should be completed within two years... 
Turkey needs natural gas and so does Europe. What must be done 
is to find financing for it." 
  Botas' chief Uzun said last week that Turkey's economic 
difficulties, coupled by the strict austerity measures imposed 
on Botas by the government jeopardized all megaprojects on the 
agenda. 
  In the economic section of the talks, the two presidents 
have 
discussed a number of projects from a Turkish carpet factory in 
Turkmenistan to a "Turkmenbasi port" on the Caspian Sea. 
Turkmenistan has the third largest number of Turkish contractors 
and the volume of trade in 1993 was 160 million dollars. Other 
projects include selling Turkish electricity to Turkmenistan and 
construction of roads and railways for this Central Asian 
republic. 
  "The two countries have given each other most favored nation 
status," President Demirel said. 
  On the political platform, the two presidents have discussed 
the venues of two upcoming international conferences. Niyazov 
said his country would be happy to host the next summit of 
Economic Cooperation Organization--a group founded by Turkey, 
Iran and Pakistan and later joined by Afghanistan, Turkic 
republics and Tajikistan. 
  "The summit was originally scheduled to take place in 
Pakistan but, if Pakistan agrees, the next venue can be 
Ashgabat," Demirel said. 
  He also said that they have decided to have Istanbul, 
instead 
of Baku, as the next venue of a Turkic Summit. 
  This was interpreted as a way to overcome the reluctance of 
Turkic leaders to hold the summit in the capital of Azerbaijan 
which is involved in fighting with another CIS member, Armenia. 
  The Baku meeting, which was scheduled for last December, was 
not realized partly due to tensions between Azerbaijan and 
Turkmenistan, which had provided natural gas to Armenia. Both 
countries have taken pains to stress that their cooperation was 
"not against any third party." 
  "We have a firm relationship based on mutual interest," 
Demirel said. 'No country should feel threatened by this."

  An official farewell ceremony was held for Karimov at the 
Cankaya Mansion this afternoon. The Uzbek president then left

was banned by the Constitutional Court last week. The court in 
its decision also decided to strip the 13 DEP deputies from 
parliament membership. 
  Shortly after the decision, the State Security Court chief 
prosecutor, Nusret Demiral, announced that Sadak and Yurtdas 
were to be detained. 
  However, acting parliament speaker Kamer Genc said in 
response that the two deputies can not be detained unless the 
court's decision is received by parliament. 
  Among all this controversy, the two deputies participated in 
a parliamentary session and asked an appointment with the 
president. 
  After the meeting which was closed to the press, Sadak said 
they briefed the president on the problems which would emerge 
after the closure of DEP and the removal of their immunity for 
prosecution. 
  `We conveyed to the president, the concerns about the 
non-representation of the southeastern people in parliament,' 
Sadak said.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Excerpts] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has 
declared that it is irresponsible of the coalition groups to 
allow the Assembly to go into recess despite the difficult 
conditions currently facing the country. 
  At a news conference in parliament today, Yilmaz charged 
that 
Turkey is experiencing the most severe economic crisis since the 
establishment of the republic, the number of workers dismissed 
from work is increasing, and inflation has reached 140 percent 
in five months. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to the economic crisis, Yilmaz noted, we are 
also 
experiencing a judicial crisis. He remarked that the decision 
of the judiciary is not being implemented despite a binding 
constitutional article on the subject. 
  [Begin Yilmaz recording] It has become clear that through 
the constitutional amendments, the government actually wants to 
ensure the continued membership of DEP [Democracy Party] 
deputies in the Assembly by changing Article 84, and to prevent 
any possibility of by-elections. The prime minister, who 
boasted of having ousted the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
from the Assembly during the local elections -- referring to DEP 
deputies -- and who said that DEP deputies are the shadow of the 
PKK in the Assembly, is now trying to amend the Constitution in 
order to keep the DEP deputies in the Assembly. This, in turn, 
is the work of a mentality unable to see even two months ahead, 
the same mentality that prevails in the economic area. [end 
recording] 
  Yilmaz pointed out that the government is allowing the 
Assembly to go into recess while the interparty constitutional 
committee decided to continue to work. The differences of views 
with regard to Article 24 can easily be overcome, Yilmaz stated. 
Explaining that ANAP is not responsible for the deadlock, Yilmaz 
claimed that the deadlock was caused when the other coalition 
partner changed its stand and used secularism as a life jacket 
in politics. The ANAP leader said: As the Assembly is going 
into recess, the issues included in the government's 
democratization package have been suspended. Now, our nation 
will carefully follow the next actions of the Social Democratic 
Populist Party, which declared that it will leave the coalition 
if the democratization package is not passed.

  [Text] Ankara -- The chairman of the Human Rights 
Association (IHD), Akin Birdal, speaking after a visit to the 
camps which are home to the Turkish Kurds who have migrated to 
Iraq, stated that the wretched war raging in the Southeast was 
to blame for the migration which was taking place. 
  "The Southeast is the region of Turkey where most human 
rights violations occur. Hundreds of mystery murders have been 
committed in this region and their number is continuing to grow. 
We receive reports of incidents of torture every day. IHD 
officials who have been conducting activities in the region are 
no longer able to do so because of the pressure they face. We 
no longer have the opportunity to investigate incidents where 
they occur. According to our findings, migration has taken 
place because of state oppression and the burning down of 
villages have been either burnt down or abandoned. The 
inhabitants of these villages have either emigrated to interior 
regions or to northern Iraq. Another cause of the migration is 
the state's approach to these people. People are given three 
choices: to become village guards, to take to the mountains, or 
to emigrate. People have chosen the third alternative. 
Approximately two million people have emigrated to the interior 
regions of Turkey. Sparks of hatred are carried with each wave 
of migrants, not the desire for peace. 
  These sparks might start off a fire. This would be a 
disaster for Turkey. I believe the solution lies in democracy 
and brotherhood. I observed during my visit that everybody 
wished to live as equals in brotherhood and peace," Birdal told 
the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS], commenting on the current violence 
in the Southeast. 
  Birdal later commented on the official claims that PKK 
(Workers Party of Kurdistan) oppression had led to migration, 
saying: "You cannot base policies on lies. There is a great 
discrepancy between official claims and what the hundreds of 
people that we have talked to have said. They are the 
witnesses. We called on deputies to put together a delegation 
to inspect the region. No one answered our call. The state has 
to protect its citizens even if the PKK has forced them to 
migrate. We will oppose all anti-democratic policies. We do 
not want any tears or any blood shed. These incidents have to 
end. We have to give our children a democratic world in which 
they can live like humans."

  [Text] Ankara -- Southeastern Turkey is once again facing 
turbulent times as migration from the region to neighboring 
north Iraq continues. 
  Twelve thousand people have fled from villages in Sirnak and 
Hakkari in the past two months, causing the Iraqis to take tight 
security measures at the border with Turkey. 
  The refugees, who first started to move into Iraq in 
February, claim that their villages were burned down by 
Government security forces and that they had been put under 
intense pressure to leave. 
  Observers from various organizations formed a delegation, 
under the auspices of the privately run Turkish Human rights 
Association, to visit and talk with the refugees who are in 
seven different camps, 15 kilometers inside the Iraqi border. 
The observer's report will be sent to the United Nations 
Commission of Human Rights, the Red Cross and other 
international groups. 
  After examining the camps, delegation chairman Akin Birdal 
said "the picture I saw hurt my conscience" and added that six 
more villages had been evacuated and burned by Government 
security forces. 
  He also told reporters that the villagers who wanted to 
leave 
the Turkish side were hindered by the security forces. 
  Chairman Birdal called for help with the refugee problem 
which he also discussed with the UN Zakho representative Ayman 
Garibeh and the governor of Dahuk, 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Tayyib. "The 
condition of the refugees is not very good, our medical teams 
visit the camps twice a week and we give them food provided by 
the World Food Fund. We have solved the refugees' water and 
sanitation problems. During our health inspections we found 20 
cases of malaria and treated them," declared UN Zakho 
representative Ayman Garibeh in a statement. 
  Ayman answered a question regarding the granting of 
political 
status to the refugees and said. 
  "We are only concerned with providing humanitarian aid, our 
centers in Ankara and Geneva are currently busy with this issue 
and they will decide on this but anyone who crosses the border 
is considered a refugee and they are not forced to return," and 
added that the UN is trying to solve this problem. 
  The governor of Dahuk said that the refugees fleeing from 
the 
Turkish side are causing them problems since the United Nations 
had demanded that the camps should be established on government 
land and that refugees should be provided with pasture areas for 
their animals. 
  He continued, ``the refugees have put us in a difficult 
situation. The migration started one year ago with a trickle of 
people and it was very easy for us to find them a place to 
settle but lately the numbers have increased dramatically and 
with our limited resources we are not able provide adequate help. 
  ``Housing in the cities is a big problem since four thousand 
villages were destroyed in the Gulf war and we settled them into 
cities.'' He also said that they were sharing the food aid they 
received with the refugees. 
  The Human Rights delegation reported that 12 thousand 
refugees lived in Hizava, Tilkabar, Dorka, Foraq, Zakho, Buhery 
and Sharanish camps. [place names as published] 
  According to the report living conditions in the camps are 
not good. 
  After the three day visit to the camps, Akin Birdal gave a 
statement to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbakir and said 
"The aid given to the refugees is not adequate and every one of 
us is responsible. We call on everyone to help. These people 
cannot survive the winter and most of them want to return to 
their home country but democratic regulations are necessary."

<F P=106> [Article by Gungor Mengi: "Have We Taken Opium?" -- </F>
punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Does Turkey stand to gain from obstructing or 
postponing the demands of the people in southeastern Anatolia? 
No, it does not. On the contrary, that approach harms its 
interests. The dissolution of the Democracy Party and the 
removal of its deputies from the parliament has come at an 
unfavorable time. While the Government moved to persecute the 
struggle it has waged against the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
[PKK], it created the impression internally and abroad that 
Turkey may deny "the reality of Kurds" at the first opportunity. 
That impression has to be corrected. The countries that we 
have persuaded to describe the PKK as a terrorist organization 
and to outlaw it must not feel that they have been deceived. 
  We should keep in mind the following: Turkey is a democratic 
country. Seeking rights through the use of arms cannot be 
explained. Each and every trend of thought must be represented 
in parliament, provided that legal boundaries are not exceeded. 
  That approach persuaded several foreign countries that had 
had a skeptical attitude toward Turkey in the past to agree that 
a legitimate struggle is waged being against the PKK. However, 
the action that has been taken against the Democracy Party and 
its deputies will endanger the support Turkey has received from 
those countries. Meanwhile, foreign pressure will be 
intensified. 
  The U.S. House of Representatives recently moved to make 
U.S. 
military aid to Turkey conditional. That was a warning. The 
promise that the U.S. Senate will rectify this state of affairs 
does not seem to be realistic, because a Senate subcommittee has 
adopted a draft resolution which is even worse. It says that 
Turkey must not use the arms and military equipment it acquires 
from the United States for internal security purposes. The 
Senate will approve it next week. Obviously, another critical 
stage will emerge in U.S.- Turkey relations. 
  It is not difficult to predict a storm in Western Europe 
judging by this gust of wind from the other side of the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
  However, an opportunity exists to resolve the Kurdish 
problem 
without harming Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. Our 
Kurdish citizens only want to have their ethnic identity 
recognized and to live as citizens of Turkey. 
  An effort is currently being made to establish a new party, 
which will be known as the People's Democracy Party. It will 
replace the Democracy Party. Serafettin Elci is working to have 
it established. Meanwhile, former People's Toil Party Deputy 
Ibrahim Aksoy is also trying to establish a new party. The 
founders of the two parties wish to secure the support of the 
masses. They have concluded from their research that the 
grassroots of their parties will not support the establishment 
of a separate state. 
  Continuing the military success that has been achieved 
against the PKK is only possible if the terrorists and the 
people are regarded separately. That is how the PKK can be 
crushed. In view of that, political tolerance and democratic 
freedoms must be broadened as Turkey draws closer to achieving a 
military victory against the PKK. Otherwise, it will not be 
difficult to predict what may happen. The state and 
administration will cause indignation in the people. 
Consequently, they will react by supporting the Prosperity 
Party. In fact, they have already begun to do so. That state 
of affairs exists not only in southeastern Turkey but also in 
the other parts of the country, including Istanbul. The people 
are using the Prosperity Party against the system and the 
administration, which are reluctant to replace inefficient and 
unsuccessful politicians. However, no one seems to realize 
that. Have we taken opium?

  [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
declared that Armenians should withdraw from occupied 
Azerbaijani territory and pay compensation for their unjust 
attacks against Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani Deputy Prime Minister 
Abbas Abbasov, who is conducting contacts in Ankara, called on 
Erbakan today. 
  In a statement during the meeting, Erbakan said he does not 
approve of the Bishkek agreement and the arrival of Russian 
troops and UN forces in the region. Erbakan claimed that the 
United Nations is anti-Islam, as demonstrated recently in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. If a peace force is established 
in Azerbaijan against the Armenians, Erbakan noted, this force 
must be comprised of Muslim countries; otherwise, Azerbaijan 
will be subjected to double standards. 
  [Begin Erbakan recording] We believe Turkey is the key to 
the prevention of all these unjust attacks. Turkey is a country 
with a population of 60 million. It is the most important 
country for the protection of peace in the Caucasus, in the 
Balkans, and in the Middle East. Therefore, Turkey must begin 
to pursue an independent policy that can protect the peace. 
[end recording] 
  Abbasov, in his statement, said the support accorded to 
Azerbaijan gives him great hope.

from his post. Kahraman submitted his resignation application to 
Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister. 
  Kahraman stated that his reason for submitting his 
resignation was that a human rights ministry has not yet been 
established. Stating that he has been exerting efforts with 
great hope and patience for a human rights ministry to be 
established as envisaged by the coalition government agreement, 
Kahraman said: In view of the negative attitude shown by our 
coalition partner, the TPP [True Path Party], toward my human 
rights ministry proposal at the Turkish Grand National Assembly 
meeting, it was impossible to establish the ministry and make it 
operational. For this reason, and because I believe that under 
these conditions it will not be possible for me to favorably 
fulfill my duties as state minister, I request that I be freed 
from my duty.

  [Text] Geneva, June 24 (AFP) -- The office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] said Friday [24 June] it was 
expecting hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to flood into 
neighbouring countries in a new flight out of the war-torn 
country. 
  Meanwhile, the UN Childrens' Fund (UNICEF) said that 14 
vehicles had reached the Rwandan capital Kigali on Thursday to 
distribute food in refugee centres. 
  "We are expecting between 250,000 and 500,000 new refugees 
because we are getting reports inside Rwanda about mass 
movements of people," said UNHCR spokeswoman Sylvana Foa. 
  She said the UNHCR welcomed the UN-mandated French military 
intervention in the central African nation, launched Thursday, 
"if it contributes to stop the atrocities." 
  But, she said, "we have to wait and see what is going to 
happen with the humanitarian operations. Every time there is a 
military operation of this kind, we have to look at security 
implications for humanitarian operations." 
  The UNHCR's mandate only allows it to look after refugees 
who 
have fled their own countries and so it is not present inside 
Rwanda, unlike, for example, the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC). 
  The UNHCR spokeswoman however said "we are looking again at 
the idea of cross-border operations" to send food into Rwanda 
from neighbouring Burundi and Zaire. 
  "Because people want to get out, but do not seem to be able 
to, they actually get killed. The border is very dangerous," 
she said. 
  There are 514,000 Rwandans currently registered in refugee 
camps set up in Tanzania, Zaire, Burundi and Uganda, said Foa. 
  The French expeditionary force, which is to have a full 
strength of 2,500, is to set up safe areas for minority Tutsi 
people who are stranded inside western Rwandan territoy held by 
forces of the majority Hutu government. 
  Up to half a million people have been killed since Rwanda 
slipped back into civil war in early April.

<F P=106> [Statement by EU Commissioner Jacques Delors at the signing </F>
ceremony of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement 
in Corfu--live in French with simultaneous translation into 
Greek] 
  [Text] [Greek translation begins while Delors' 
introductory statement in French is already in progress] ...Amid 
difficulties, but these difficulties were overcome and Russia 
today signs the greatest agreement it has ever concluded with 
any other country or any other group of countries. We owe this 
to the work done by the experts, Russian experts on one side and 
European experts on the other. We also owe it to the political 
will expressed by yourself, President Yeltsin, and by the 12 
members of the European Union [EU]. 
  This agreement includes acts of the past and gives them a 
more functional and fuller framework that will result in the 
prospect for a zone of free exchanges. It will facilitate 
exchanges of European businesses in Russia and to this I add the 
signature of the European Charter for energy. I believe that, 
in this way, many new possibilities will open for Russia with 
its tremendous natural resources. This agreement allows for 
exchange in many sectors and services, it is really an 
innovation. Finally, I believe that within the framework of 
this agreement we will be able to develop our scientific 
cooperation, to use with our own resources the (?excellent) 
resources that you have in the field of science [words 
indistinct] and in the field toward cooperation and peace. 
  I believe that this agreement is a very good framework. Of 
course, this agreement also includes the possibility for close 
partnership in the political sector, (?regular) consultations 
between yourself and the representatives of the 12 member states 
and 16 [words indistinct] members of the EU. 
  Finally, through this agreement, Russia--which was, is, and 
will remain, an important power--will be able to play its role 
fully in our continent, at this end of Asia and the Pacific 
Ocean. 
  I would also like say a few words about the Russian people. 
The Russian people have followed a road full of obstacles and 
difficulties. Difficulties for the deepening of democracy, 
difficulties in reaching an open and competitive economy. 
However, in the past, the Russian people have shown so many 
possibilities of overcoming these difficulties and I am certain 
that they will succeed in this difficult task. I would also 
like you to allow me to convey, through you, this thought to the 
Russian people who today are even nearer to us because this 
agreement includes a great political significance. Thanks to 
this agreement Russia, as a large power, will be able to enter 
the 21st century. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F>
Guenter Schmidt at the EU summit in Corfu on 25 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Schmidt] Mr. Chancellor, in the days preceding 
this trip to Corfu, there was a controversy over competence in 
Austria. Do you have the impression that this controversy 
affected the work here and, in particular, the goodwill Austria 
had in Europe after the success in the referendum? 
  [Vranitzky] No, it has not had an affect. This so-called 
competence discussion was conducted only by a few people in 
Austria and was unduly exaggerated in the media. For me, this 
has not been a discussion. We have done our job here in Corfu, 
and we have done it in the interest of our country, which was 
our duty. This is the main subject that one should discuss. 
  [Schmidt] In St. George's Chapel, where you signed the 
treaty yesterday, one could hear many friendly and positive 
words about Austria and about the role Austria can play in 
Europe in the future. What is your overall impression? Where 
these mainly Sunday speeches or was there more behind them? 
  [Vranitzky] No, these were certainly not Sunday speeches. 
All in all, this EU [European Union] summit, in which we 
participated for the first time -- this time still as observers 
-- has yielded a most favorable result. It was not just the 
signing of a treaty between the Republic of Austria and the 
European Union and all its members, but here, for the first 
time, a productive meeting has been held between the EU members, 
including ourselves, on the one hand, and President Yeltsin, on 
the other. An agreement on economic cooperation, peace, and 
stability was signed. Second, and this refers to us Austrians, 
in particular, one hour ago, the basic document was accepted, 
which states that, for example, the major railroad construction 
projects -- in our case, this is the Verona- Munich line -- have 
been included in the list of EU projects. There was some debate 
on the issue, but it was finally accepted. Third -- and this is 
of particular importance to me -- for the first time, as far as 
I know, the European Union discussed the issue of Chernobyl in 
this form. It may not have done so in a way that is absolutely 
satisfactory, but at least it was indicated that something has 
to be done and that we must defend ourselves against these 
faulty power plants. 
  One must certainly also note with satisfaction what was 
decided and discussed with the next Council president, our 
neighboring country Germany -- namely to attribute particular 
attention to the issues related to internal security. We will 
launch joint actions in the sphere of fighting international 
crime, narcotics smuggling, money laundering, and many other 
issues. 
  [Schmidt] Mr. Chancellor, you have mentioned the 
Verona-Munich railroad connection, which also includes the 
tunnel beneath the Brenner Pass. EU projects tend to take a 
long time, because they involve much and profound discussion. 
What schedule can one expect for this project? 
  [Vranitzky] We must do the necessary preliminary work at 
home, which is what we have done. On 4 May, we concluded a 
basic agreement at the level of the federal and Tirolean 
provincial government and the Austrian Federal Railways. As far 
as the planning is concerned, the work has already started. 
This is, of course, taking some time in our own country, too. 
Land has to be bought, the authorities must carry out the 
necessary licensing procedures, and then there are hearings 
involving affected citizens. We do not have to say that the 
European Union is taking a long time, because we have to do our 
job at home first. Besides, this applies also to the major 
projects in eastern Austria. I have to emphasize this again and 
again that the transport projects include, of course the Inn 
Valley, but not only. Other areas of our republic are also 
struggling with heavy and even heavier traffic. There, too, one 
has to take the necessary precautions for the future.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry gave its first press briefing 
on the start of Operation Turquoise and on what the French 
troops discovered when they arrived on the spot. Here is 
General Germanos being interviewed by Frederique Barrere: 
  [Begin Germanos recording] The mission that we planned, and 
which consisted of going inside Rwanda without using force, has 
been conducted in good conditions. The mission allowed us to 
get in touch with both the people who are governing Rwanda 
today, and the Tutsi who are being detained in a certain number 
of camps. At the moment, no French base has been established on 
Rwandan territory. The aim is to reassure the population 
without staying in this country. We have to point out, however, 
that a certain number of [word indistinct] were reported to us 
and that common graves have been discovered. They are few for 
the moment. I stress this because we have not yet fully 
assessed the situation, but we can now say they exist. [end

<F P=106> [By Michel Sailhan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Paris, June 24 (AFP) -- Advance units of French 
combat troops began setting up a field hospital in southwestern 
Rwanda on Friday [24 June] as a first step in their contested 
intervention in the central African nation's murderous ethnic 
war. 
  A crack 60-strong unit that arrived at Cyangugu, across the 
border from Zaire, on Thursday, was on Friday assessing the 
humanitarian needs of the civilian population of the region, the 
army's Information Department said here. 
  A giant Russian-built Antonov 22 transport plane left France 
on Friday with 80 tonnes of medical equipment and medicines. 
The plane was bound either for Bangui, Central African 
Republic, or Libreville, Gabon, a military spokesman said. 
  The equipment would then be transferred to France's two 
staging areas in eastern Zaire at Goma and Bukavu. A second 
Antonov carrying a similar 80-tonne cargo was scheduled to leave 
Lyon, central France, for Africa later on Friday. 
  Meanwhile a UN spokesman reported in the capital, Kigali, 
that rebel and army gunners pounded Kigali overnight and 
sporadic fighting continued Friday as UN forces prepared to 
evacuate hundreds of displaced people from the airport, a United 
Nations spokesman said. 
  "The fighting was very intense last night," said UN military 
spokesman Jean-Guy Plante, contacted by telephone from Nairobi. 
"There was a lot of heavy mortar and machinegun fire." 
  Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels are pressing their 
offensive to flush remaining government soldiers out of the 
capital Kigali, apparently fearing that the French troops may 
forestall an all-out victory by the rebels, who control about 
two-thirds of the small central African country. 
  In Paris, the military said the 60 troops sent on the 
UN-mandated mercy mission spent their first night in Cyangugu 
"without incident" and were "welcomed" by local people. [passage 
omitted] 
  The 50-bed field hospital will have an operating theatre and 
12 doctors forming two full medical teams. [passage omitted] 
  The French expeditionary force, which will have a full 
strength of 2,500, is to set up safe areas for minority Tutsi 
people who are stranded inside territory held by forces of the 
majority Hutu government. [passage omitted] 
  In Nairobi, the STANDARD newspaper, which is owned by the 
Lonrho multinational, said Friday the French operation was "pure 
neo-colonialism" aimed at strengthening French influence in the 
regime. 
  Plante said UN commander General Romeo Dallaire planned to 
meet Rwandan Army chief of staff General Augustin Bizimungu 
later Friday to discuss the French intervention and the future 
UN role in Rwanda. 
  The UN has fewer than 500 soldiers in Rwanda, but plans to 
boost the force to several thousand. [passage omitted] 
  Plante said UN troops in Kigali planned to escort about 800 
displaced people under UN guard at the airport to a camp at the 
King Faisal hospital where thousands of civilians are sheltering.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Italy Will Depart, in Any Case"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] Yesterday Army Chief 
Incisa di Camerana confirmed that the Army is thinking in terms 
of a 450-man task force [to send to Rwanda], 300 at least of 
whom would be "Col Moschin" Brigade parachutists and "Comsubin" 
Brigade marines from the Navy, the rest being logistics experts. 
The Italians would transfer to Africa some 30 trucks and other 
vehicles with which to venture onto the Rwandan plateaus. Most 
of the logistic support, including air cover and helicopter 
transport, would be provided by the French. 
  Incisa stated that "right now the Army is waiting for 
orders; 
we shall send to Rwanda what the politicians ask us to. I 
received the advance alarm last Thursday [16 June], at the end 
of an exercise. They telephoned me confirming the possibility of 
an operation." 
  Incisa mentioned that this operation will be led by Chief of 
the Defense Staff Admiral Guido Venturoni, who has also 
emphasized that if the Army is asked to undertake tasks which 
"in our opinion cannot be carried out, we shall tell the 
government so." According to the chief of staff, other aspects 
to be considered will be those of the command and of the rules 
of engagement. 
  Yesterday Incisa gave a lecture at the CASD, the Center for 
Advanced Defense Studies, the third chief of staff in three days 
to talk of the problems of defense, and his -- like those of the 
heads of the Navy and the Air Force -- was a cry of alarm. The 
three Armed Forces are calling for the reversal of the tendency 
to cut defense spending, but are calling in particular on the 
government to decide clearly what "defense model" Italy should 
adopt, and to set to work to implement it. 
  "So far we have done the opposite; we have an existing 
structure which we have pared down without a clear project in 
mind," Incisa said. The general is thinking for the future "of 
an army of Franciscans," no luxuries, no waste, but economic 
treatment and resources to match the tasks clearly assigned by 
the government and Parliament. The Army is projecting a force 
of some 150,000 men, including 60,000 volunteers and 40,000 
draft soldiers. The conversion process is long: In 10 years it 
will require a financial commitment of 19 trillion, but 9 
trillion can be saved in cuts in the draft, which will gradually 
become more conspicuous. 
  On Wednesday the head of the Navy, Admiral Angelo Mariani, 
had warned that the time was coming when the fleet would be 
completely obsolete: "We need today a new shipbuilding program 
which in 10 years will begin to give us the ships which will 
enable us to maintain the Navy in existence." General Adelchi 
Pillinini, the head of the Air Force, is, if this is possible, 
in an even worse situation: Already the Air Force lacks the 
necessary aircraft to protect the country, and has been forced 
to "lease" certain English Air Force Tornados because its 
F-104's are now decrepit.

  [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis returned tonight from 
Corfu, through Athens, where he had contacts on the sidelines of 
the European Union [EU] summit. President Kliridhis held a 
meeting with Andreas Papandreou, European Council president and 
Greek prime minister; Jacques Delors, European Commission 
president; and other leaders with whom he discussed developments 
in the Cyprus issue and the issue of Cyprus' accession to the EU. 
  In Athens, President Kliridhis also discussed the joint 
Cyprus-Greece defense doctrine with Greek National Defense 
Minister Yerasimos Arsenis and the results of Mr. Arsenis' 
meetings in Washington. President Kliridhis and Yerasimos 
Arsenis held a private meeting, after which they did not make 
any statements. According to a Greek National Defense Ministry 
statement, they examined the progress of promoting the doctrine 
and discussed the current phase of the Cyprus issue in light of 
the latest developments concerning the UN initiatives in the 
confidence-building measures and the efforts to disengage the 
process from the Turkish side's intransigence.

  [Text] Geneva, June 27 (AFP) -- One thousand Rwandan 
orphans were evacuated from the village of Nyanza to the Burundi 
border after renewed fighting in the region, a spokesman for the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Monday [27 
June]. 
  The orphans who were taken by the ICRC to the border village 
of Rilima had been tended by Belgian and Italian nuns. 
  ICRC spokesman Paul-Henri Morard said most children were 
ethnic Tutsis. 
  Trucks which made the Nyanza trip also carried 250 patients 
from a Nyanza hospital and 250 ICRC staff and local workers. 
  Since the weekend the ICRC has also evacuated 105 patients 
from its overcrowded hospital in a government-controlled area of 
the capital to the King Faisal hospital in a district held by 
the rebels, according to Morard. 
  Five hundred wounded are still in the ICRC hospital. 
  French General Raymond Germanos meanwhile said in Paris 
French troops would evacuate 40 nuns from the west Rwandan 
village of Kibuye to the headquarters of the French intervention 
force in Goma, Zaire, on Tuesday. 
  The nuns from Canada, Rwanda, the United States and other 
countries were "highly afraid" after threats, he said.

  [Text] Brussels, June 27 (AFP) -- France has asked Belgium 
to supply medical aid such as emergency hospital units for its 
military intervention in Rwanda, the Ministry of Defence said 
Monday [27 June]. 
  Belgium has agreed to transport the equipment as long as 
French soldiers "ensure the safety of any surgeons sent to 
Rwanda," a spokesman said. Belgium also wanted to see the 
French security zone extended, "so our team can work in the best 
possible conditions." 
  France was interested in the type of Belgian unit already 
used in Somalia, complete with medical supplies and personnel, 
which can carry out operations in any situation, he said. The 
location of the unit has not been established. 
  Two field hospitals have already been set up at French base 
camps in nearby Zaire for Operation Turquoise, launched last 
Thursday, described by Paris as a humanitarian bid to stop 
ethnic killings in the Rwandan civil war.

  [Text] Vienna, June 27 (AFP) -- Two inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are on their way to 
North Korea to replace their two colleagues who have been 
working at the contentious Yongbyon plant for several weeks, an 
IAEA spokesman said Monday [27 June]. 
  Hans-Friedrich Meyer said the two new inspectors, who should 
arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday, will continue supervision of the 
experimental nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 90 kilometres (56 
miles) north of the capital. 
  North Korea created a crisis earlier this month by refusing 
to allow international supervision to check whether material has 
been diverted from the Yongbyon complex for military use. 
  One of the two inspectors currently in Korea will leave 
Tuesday and the other will leave at the end of the week after 
briefing his two colleagues, Meyer said. 
  "It is essential for us that two inspectors remain on the 
spot," Meyer stressed, adding that the two officials obtained 
visas without any trouble. 
  The duration of the inspectors' visit has not been fixed, 
but 
an "old rule" of the atomic watchdog fixes inspectors' tours of 
duty at three weeks. 
  Bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea 
are 
scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 8. 
  North Korea paved the way for the new talks by agreeing not 
to refuel the reactor, and not to reprocess nuclear fuel -- to 
make the plutonium needed to manufacture atomic weapons -- and 
to allow the IAEA inspectors to remain in North Korea.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime 
minister, who is on an official visit to Belgium, has met with 
Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback. Karayalcin said: 
Minister Tobback stated that it is impossible to impose a ban 
on the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization 
or similar organizations but added that Belgium will take the 
necessary steps against all activities that disrupt the peace. 
Turkish Radio and Television correspondent Yasar Kefeli reports 
from Brussels: 
  [Begin Kefeli recording] Karayalcin met with Tobback and 
later answered reporters' question on the issues discussed at 
the meeting. In answer to a reporter's question on Belgium's 
attitude toward the PKK terrorist organization, Karayalcin said 
Belgium is against all acts of violence and will not permit any 
disruptive activities in the country. 
  Karayalcin said he was happy to hear that Turkish citizens 
living in Belgium have very good relations with the Belgian 
community. 
  In answer to another question, Karayalcin said the issue of 
the former Democracy Party deputies was not raised at the 
meeting. 
  Tomorrow, Karayalcin will meet with European Union [EU]

<F P=106> [Article by Benedicte Vaes: "Return of Heart: Watch Out </F>
for a Cardiac Arrest"] 
  [Text] Pushed by Happart and its trade union rank and file, 
will the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] enter the budget 
negotiations with the intention of converting them into a social 
crusade? [Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc Dehaene, encouraged 
by his still fresh popularity and international credibility, has 
warned the PS against trying to turn the government to the left. 
Dehaene does not have the least intention of deviating from the 
line he established for himself or from the white paper. 
  "There is no question of making the same mistake as in 1988 
and reducing our efforts," he said. "Any `return of heart' 
[reference to PS election slogan] which is not based on a good 
diet leads straight to a cardiac arrest. Having a healthy 
economy and public finances is good for the heart." 
  The CVP [Christian People's Party] Budget Minister Herman 
Van 
Rompuy had already made an initial warning to the PS. The prime 
minister, who is planning to stay, "I intend to go through to 
the end of my term of office and to ask for a mandate to 
continue," confirms this. 
  Dehaene had the following message for those who, following 
Jose Happart, want to break up the Austerity Plan and review 
privatization: "The electorate wants us to stick to our guns. 
It is the best strategy to counter the extreme right: People 
need to cling to something. There is no question of changing 
direction every time, otherwise we will have a boomerang effect." 
  The 1995 budget, which must be elaborated in July, will not 
be an easy job, Dehaene confirmed after Van Rompuy. "Wage 
moderation is making companies more competitive but reducing 
state revenue and social security payments," he said. Where 
will the difference be found? In the pocket of the people? 
While not brandishing a tax veto, Dehaene wants to be 
reassuring. "We have already asked people to make very 
considerable sacrifices," he said. "Additional taxes or charges 
are not the first option. That is the easy solution." 
  Will the social sector be excluded from the negotiations? "I 
do not rule out new measures for employment, even if the 
budgetary margin is tight," he said. 
  On the "Clarification" news show, Dehaene went out of his 
way 
to explain that the measures of the Austerity Plan would give 
the hoped-for results, as long as "time is allowed to take its 
course and the government is stable." Dehaene is planning to 
strengthen the initial measures so that the burgeoning recovery 
can translate into jobs. Dehaene also has singled out the 
results of the youth employment plan (40,000 jobs). 
  However, there is no reason to hope that wage moderation 
will 
automatically lead to jobs. The 1995-1996 interprofessional 
negotiations will start under unfavorable auspices. The 
employers do not intend to let themselves be tied by any 
employment constraints, and they seem to consider that the 
agreement is still-born. 
  But in Philippe Busquin's circles it was confirmed yesterday 
that the PS only demanded to adapt social measures regarding 
employment. It judges that all the social problems causing the 
rise of the extreme right are linked to unemployment and is 
demanding additional measures to help people return to work: A 
local employment plan, increased security contracts, 
multiservice checks and lower working times. Can these paths be 
taken without compromizing the convergence? The negotiations 
will give the answer.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Christophe Lamfalussy: "Toward a Head-On </F>
Collision"] 
  [Text] Europe is heading straight for an internal crisis, a 
head-on collision between Germany and Great Britain, if German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major do 
not succeed in reaching agreement on the future president of the 
European Commission prior to the special summit of 15 July. 
  The British veto against [Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc 
Dehaene is so categoric and seems so irrevocable that it has 
placed Mr. Major in a situation from which there is no escape: 
He must either climb down over Europe, which would split his 
Conservative Party that little bit more, or enter into open 
conflict with his European partners at a time when Germany and 
France are getting ready to take over, the one after the other, 
the European Union's presidency. 
  John Major, who adopted a very Thatcher-like position in 
Corfu, chose his camp, alone against all the rest, and unable to 
rally to the consensus that formed around Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
This inflexibility would be to his credit if Major was 
defending a worthwhile cause. But it rather seems like a 
political move designed to win support at home at Europe's 
expense. Several British newspapers applauded his "courage" in 
their Sunday [26 June] editions. The aim has been achieved. 
  Nobody can dispute Great Britain's right to demonstrate its 
difference and its insular nature. The problem today, with the 
lame compromise of the Maastricht Treaty, is that Great Britain 
is playing a double game. It is sufficiently involved in Europe 
to stop it moving forward, and sufficiently distanced to do what 
it likes. 
  Jean-Luc Dehaene was right on Sunday to stress that the 
Corfu 
veto threatens to fuel the arguments of those who are arguing 
for a multispeed Europe. How can we not conclude from the 
British attitude that only a variable-geometry Europe can both 
accommodate the British and absorb an increasing pace of 
enlargement? A hard core would serve as a test and as an 
example. [sentence as published] And you can bet that London 
would very quickly be seeking to join it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Guido Boodts: "Impossible Major"] </F>
  [Text] The impossibility of finding a successor to European 
Commission (EC) President Jacques Delors at the Corfu summit has 
inflicted deep wounds upon Europe. The British veto against 
Jean-Luc Dehaene probably hurts the Belgian prime minister less 
than anyone. 
  The whole affair caused acerbic reactions in the Netherlands 
where they threaten to have an impact on public opinion 
regarding the whole question of European unification, enthusiasm 
for which has already cooled in recent years, as evident in the 
low turnout for the European elections. 
  Dehaene cannot withdraw after 11 countries, some more 
spontaneously than others, have supported his candidacy. Major, 
on the other hand, has committed himself so strongly that it is 
impossible for him to agree to the appointment of Dehaene 
without loss of face. 
  The question as to who will or will not be considered as 
Delors' successor will now be the subject of a great deal of 
string pulling, especially behind the scenes. We have seen how 
these things work. In the meantime, we cannot avoid drawing a 
number of conclusions. 
  Prime Minister Major is seeing a constant crumbling of his 
own authority and of his parliamentary majority. His leadership 
of the Conservative Party is being openly questioned. Since 
Maastricht, it has become increasingly clear that he is the 
prisoner of a relatively small, but vociferous and determined 
group of Euroskeptics who are constantly threatening to bring 
him down. This group's hold is becoming stronger as Major's 
position becomes weaker. The worst of it is that the group is 
gradually getting the whole of Europe in its grip by hindering 
the decisionmaking process. 
  London could more or less correctly claim that France and 
Germany sought to impose their candidate on the other European 
Union (EU) countries. But how can one defend the fact that one 
country can oppose the will of 11 other countries? Not just 
once, in the Dehaene affair, but on countless occasions. The 
position is in fact that British interests, or rather the 
interests of the British prime minister and his government, 
weigh heavier than those of the whole of Europe. 
  In such a situation, Major should have the courage to give 
up 
EU full membership, as France did under De Gaulle in the case of 
NATO membership when it failed to correspond to the basic 
philosophy of the alliance. With the opt-outs in the Maastricht 
Treaty, he has in fact already gone down this road without 
admitting so in public. He would do better to formalize the 
British position. If he does not do so, the other EU countries 
must demand that he does. 
  German Chancellor Kohl will be faced with a difficult issue 
right from the start of his European presidency on 1 July. In a 
year which will decide his political future at the parliamentary 
elections in the spring, Kohl has to find a way out which cannot 
be interpreted as a sign of his own weakness or a victory by 
British Prime Minister Major. 
  Kohl is rightly aiming at a solution before the first 
meeting 
of the recently elected European Parliament (EP) on 19 July. The 
EP would certainly feel the failure of the government leaders to 
elect the EC president as an attack on one of its most recently 
acquired major competences, namely the granting of confidence in 
the EC. It would threaten the essential good working 
relationship between the political EU institutions right from 
the outset. 
  The idea for the European Commissioner to be elected by the 
EP if necessary then becomes more attractive. Such a proposal 
was already circulating at the time of the Maastricht 
negotiations. Under the present "constitutional" relationships 
in the Union, this is impossible. But it should be a subject 
for the intergovernmental conference on the review of Maastricht 
in 1996.

<F P=106> [Jerry Van Waterschoot commentary: "Arbitrary Markets"] </F>
  [Text] Next month, it will be 50 years since the 
foundations were laid for the postwar international monetary 
system at the American coastal town of Bretton Woods, yet 
monetary stability is further away than ever. The dollar is 
defying the law of gravity, and foreign exchange markets, bond 
markets, and stock exchanges are alight. 
  Not much remains of the fixed parities which, for decades, 
ensured law and order in international economic relations. 
Exchange rate fluctuations, which earlier would have been 
called a devaluation or revaluation, now happen in the space of 
a few hours. Since last year, even the European Monetary System 
-- the last beacon in the monetary chaos -- is heading toward 
fluctuation bands which remind one more of floating exchange 
rates than fixed parities. 
  Leaving the setting of national currencies up to the free 
market has given individual countries much more room for 
maneuver than they used to have under Bretton Woods. 
Unorchestrated leaps in economic policy are no longer held back 
by fixed parities; instead they are reflected in wild currency 
fluctuations. 
  At the same time, the financial markets are leading their 
own 
lives. The reserves held by the central banks are just small 
change in comparison with the enormous amounts of capital 
shifted every day. Markets for currencies, raw materials, 
bonds, and shares influence each other's trends. New, 
sophisticated financial instruments cut across existing 
patterns. Markets are breaking away from the underlying 
economic fundamentals, and are increasingly letting themselves 
be driven by expectations of expectations [as published]. 
  The nervousness has increased even more since the recent 
turnaround in the economy, a move which is now well established 
in the United States, while Europe and Japan are still only just 
recovering from the recession. This situation has caused more 
distortion than before. In Europe, long-term interest rates are 
shooting upward too, although this is not justified by low 
growth and inflation. The dollar is sinking, while according to 
all the guidebooks and forecasts its should be rising. What 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says or does -- whether 
he increases interest rates or waits a while instead -- will 
still cause uneasy shivers in the markets. Greenspan has lost 
his grip on the greenback. 
  With all these complications, the markets are forgetting 
that 
the underlying causes are actually very positive. The American 
economy, which not long ago seemed doomed to eternal recession, 
is reaching for the stars. Yet, there are no concrete signs of 
an inflation backlash. 
  Do these arbitrary market reactions necessarily mean that we 
are heading for a financial crisis? That is what it is called, 
after all. The market always finds its balance. It may cause 
problems, but it is always the beginning of something new. The 
stock market crash of 1987 was also originally called a crisis. 
Subsequently, it looked like a correction to an exaggerated 
movement, and had no impact on the real economy. 
  If people want to avoid such corrections, then an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure. A little more coordination 
between the industrialized countries in their underlying 
economic policy concerning the balance of payments, government 
budget, income development, growth, or combatting inflation 
would help a lot.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Judith Stalpers: "West Does Not Know What </F>
Game North Korea Is Playing"] 
  [Text] Does the West actually know what game Kim Il- Song 
is playing? Is it one-on-one, or is he playing simultaneous 
chess against the United States, South Korea, Japan, and China? 
Or is he not playing chess at all, but poker? The West is 
guessing and that is what Kim Il-Song's power is based on: 
Keeping the West and his own people in the dark. 
  The West does not know if North Korea has plutonium. The 
West does not know if North Korean engineers have the knowledge 
to produce an atomic bomb. The West does not know if China is a 
friend or foe of North Korea. The West does not know how much 
support the North Korean leader has in his own country. The 
West does not know what the economic situation of that Communist 
state is actually like. 
  The West suspects all this, and more, and the suspicions 
contradict each other. That plays into North Korea's hands. 
According to the hawks in the United States, North Korea already 
has at least two bombs. The Russian foreign minister asserted 
once again on Saturday [18 June] that North Korea does not have 
a bomb now, nor will it have one in the near future. CIA 
reports talk of a possible coup and a starving population. 
Journalists and diplomats have failed to uncover any trace of 
unrest and talk of flourishing trade between North Korea and 
China. 
  The United States, South Korea, and Japan are making great 
efforts to maintain the illusion that they are carrying out a 
policy. "The crisis is over. America has stopped lobbying for 
sanctions," former President Carter exulted triumphantly after 
returning from Pyongyang. Clinton's staff had to do everything 
they could to play down Carter's words without putting too much 
emphasis on the difference of opinion. 
  The United States is aiming to have North Korea henceforth 
place all developments in its nuclear program under the control 
of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. That could 
prevent the possible sale of nuclear material to, say, Iran or 
Libya. However, it does not guarantee that North Korea does not 
have a bomb. South Korea and Japan want a nuclear-free 
peninsula, so that the dictator cannot exert any pressure on 
them with his atomic weapons. The two countries want more, 
namely that the IAEA be given access to those installations 
which could provide information on North Korean obscure 
activities. 
  The situation is calm in Korea for the time being. The 
threat of sanctions has been put on the back burner, and there 
is no war-like rhetoric coming out of Pyongyang. If, however, 
everything goes ahead just like Carter cooked up with the 
"well-meaning" Kim, then Kim will be the big winner, no matter 
what the game is called. He will have a dialogue with the 
United States, economic support, diplomatic recognition, safer 
nuclear plants, and perhaps an atomic bomb. What will the rest 
of the world get in return? 
  A second Korean war has indeed been prevented, but now there 
is nuclear proliferation. If there continues to be strong 
suspicions that North Korea has at least two atomic bombs, then 
who can prohibit South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan from also having 
an atomic bomb? And if the world condones the fact that North 
Korea has two nuclear warheads in its backyard, then who will 
guarantee that Iraq and Libya will not tinker around with things 
themselves and ignore any threat from the IAEA or the Security 
Council? 
  Only Kim knows what game he is playing. If the West does not 
play along with his "overtures," then he will still have won a 
few months before the fire is stoked on the Korean peninsula. 
And what will he do in that time? Will he extract plutonium 
from the recently exchanged fuel rods which he can use to add 
four atomic bombs to his arsenal?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition to Another Dutchman for </F>
European Commission"] 
  [Text] The four major political parties are divided on the 
question as to whether the Netherlands should put forward a new 
candidate for the presidency of the European Commission. The 
VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] and the CDA 
[Christian Democratic Appeal] consider that the Netherlands 
should not knuckle under following the failure of the candidacy 
of outgoing Prime Minister Lubbers. The PvdA [Labor Party] and 
D66 [Democrats 66]) on the other hand find it "unwise and 
inopportune" to submit a new Netherlands candidate. 
  Following the failure of Corfu, the political parties are 
united in their disappointment at the failure of Lubbers to 
succeed Jacques Delors as president of the executive arm of the 
European Union (EU). They are all also critical of the 
intransigent stance of German Chancellor Kohl on the Netherlands 
candidacy and of the British veto against Belgian Prime Minister 
Dehaene. 
  But The Hague is politically divided on the question as to 
whether the Netherlands should once again enter the battle. 
Deadlock again seems likely at the special summit now planned 
for 15 July. The German presidency of the Union (from 1 July) 
remains committed to Dehaene while Mr. Major's Conservative 
government in Great Britain is equally committed to its veto 
against the Belgian prime minister. 
  If Dehaene sees the lack of consensus as grounds for 
withdrawing his candidacy, the battle is then thrown open again, 
Second Chamber members Weisgals (VVD) and De Hoop Scheffe (CDA) 
believe. They will then call upon the PvdA, the CDA, the VVD, 
and D66 leaders to consider a new Netherlands candidate.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok: For the Time Being, the </F>
`Purple' Coalition Will Not Modify Entitlement to Allowance"] 
  [Text] A "purple" coalition [comprising the Labor Party 
(PvdA), the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and 
Democrats 66 (D66]) will not modify the WAO [Occupational 
Disability Insurance] benefits right away. The recently 
implemented legislation on stricter inspections of incapacitated 
persons, must first demonstrate its use in practice. According 
to PvdA leader Kok, an agreement was reached with VVD leader 
Bolkestein, and D66 leader Van Mierlo on this subject. 
  Kok does not rule out additional measures during the new 
cabinet legislature. Whether or not this will happen, depends 
on a criterion to be established in social security. The three 
parties still have to come to terms on this criterion. There 
are rumors about a standard for the number of persons entitled 
to an allowance, or for the overall amount of money involved in 
social security. 
  Last Tuesday night [21 June] after the "purple" coalition 
talks, it also turned out that the three negotiators still 
disagree on the steps to be taken at that moment. 
  The "purple" negotiators (namely Kok, Bolkestein, and Van 
Mierlo) are proposing a new package of policy measures to the 
Central Planning Bureau (CPB), which should serve as a first 
outline of a coalition agreement. On Tuesday morning, the 
relevant parties' financial experts reached an agreement on a 
different implementation of previously agreed savings, involving 
a total of 20 billion guilders. 
  Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo requested calculations for 
several policy measures. At the end of the week, when Kok will 
be back from the European summit on Corfu, the final decision 
will have to be taken. Depending on the results of the CPB 
calculations in terms of employment and purchasing power, the 
negotiators will then decide whether or not a "purple" cabinet 
is feasible. However, additional adjustments are not ruled out 
at that stage. Kok expects the knots to be cut "next weekend or 
immediately after that." 
  An important reference point for the negotiators, is an 
increase of employment by at least 100,000 jobs. In addition, 
PvdA and D66 made their political approval subject to an 
unchanged distribution of incomes. 
  A previous calculation by the CPB, had stranded at upwards 
of 
70,000 jobs. When including the effects of new policy plans 
(such as in the police force), between 74,000 and 75,000 
additional jobs would be created. For all three parties, these 
figures are largely insufficient. The lowest incomes would 
suffer a 2 percent loss in purchasing power, while the average 
income would remain practically the same. This is unacceptable 
to PvdA. 
  Another complication is that the consequences of certain 
measures fall outside the CPB model's scope.

  [Text] This is the full text of the Prime Minister's 
Commons statement on the Corfu EU [European Union] summit: 
  ``I will make a statement about the meeting of the European 
Council which I attended with the Foreign Secretary and 
Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Corfu Council put another 
three building blocks in place in constructing post-Communist 
Europe. 
  ``First, the Treaties of Accession signed with Austria, 
Finland, Norway and Sweden will help create the wider Europe 
that we seek: a European Union [EU] that extends from the 
Atlantic to the Arctic. I warmly welcome the positive vote on 
accession in the recent Austrian referendum. I hope referenda 
in the other three EFTA countries this autumn will be equally 
successful. 
  ``Second, we agreed in Corfu that the Association Agreements 
with our Central and East European partners must be fully and 
urgently implemented. So should the UK/Italian initiative to 
link these countries more closely with the foreign affairs and 
home affairs pillars. This will help them to prepare for full 
membership of the EU as soon as possible. Cyprus and Malta, 
too, will be involved in the next phase of enlargement. 
  ``Third, the EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation 
Agreement with Russia -- one of the most comprehensive 
agreements ever concluded between the community and another 
country. President Yeltsin said the agreement symbolised 
Russia's return to the economic life of Europe as an equal 
partner. He also pledged the support of his government in 
bringing about stability in Central and East Europe and his 
willingness to work closely over former Yugoslavia. Russia has 
just signed the Partnership for Peace Agreement with Nato and on 
July 9 President Yeltsin will play a full part in the political 
debate at the Naples summit. I warmly welcome Russia's 
increasing integration with Western political institutions.'' 
  Mr Major told the Commons: ``In the discussion of the 
problems facing people throughout Europe, I suggested a series 
of moves to combat drug trafficking and other international 
crime. The drugs problem throughout Europe is growing. Enough 
cocaine has been seized in the EU this year to provide 24 
million individual doses. I pressed for more effective 
cross-border intelligence gathering on drug trafficking. I 
urged the community to strengthen the Europol drugs unit and to 
set up the full European Police Office quickly, with a wide 
remit to tackle organised cross-border crime. I underlined the 
importance of action within our own countries. I suggested that 
the Union should hold a conference on drugs and organised crime, 
and should involve countries in Central and East Europe. I was 
glad to receive wide support for these proposals, which were 
endorsed in the conclusions of the Council. 
  ``We made progress on two economic issues high on the 
British 
agenda. 
  ``First, we agreed that markets in telecommunications and 
energy should be further liberalised, to give Europe's consumers 
access to wider, cheaper and more efficient services. 
  ``Second, we strongly supported the German proposal to set 
up 
a European Deregulation Task Force with businessmen as members, 
precisely as we have done in this country. This was agreed. 
The Task Force will help to cut back burdensome community 
regulations on business. 
  ``The Council endorsed the macro-economic guidelines drawn 
up 
by the Economic and Financial Council on the conditions for 
sustainable growth. We agreed that it was essential to continue 
cutting public sector deficits and reducing inflation. 
  ``I reported that the British economy had grown by nearly 3 
percent in the year to this Spring, and that unemployment had 
fallen here by by over 300,000 since the end of 1992. Britain 
remains the fastest-growing of the big economies in the EU.'' 
  Mr Major said: ``The Council approved a first priority list 
of 11 trans-European network projects. This includes the second 
Channel Tunnel rail link and proposals to improve the rail links 
between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Any contribution to 
the financing of such projects must come from within existing 
community resources. At our insistence, the Council agreed that 
there could be no financial guarantee from the community for 
trans-European networks. We believe that Europe's taxpayers must 
be protected against such open-ended commitments. 
  ``We heard further evidence that the subsidiarity principle 
is being successfully implemented. We expect the number of main 
legislative proposals coming out of Brussels this year to be 
about half the number in 1993, and a quater of the total four 
years ago. This is a very significant improvement. 
  ``In external policy, the Council discussed Ukraine and 
agreed to step up support for economic reform and nuclear safety 
there, tied to the closure of Chernobyl. This discussion will 
be taken forward with the United States, Japan and Canada at the 
Economic Summit in Naples in early July. 
  ``The Council once again discussed Bosnia. The Contact Group 
has done valuable work based on the EU's plan; but there is an 
urgent need for the parties to show the will for a negotiated 
settlement if the process is to succeed. 
  ``We agreed that the EU would make every effort with the 
United States and Russia to bring the negotiations to a point of 
decision.'' 
  Mr Major told the House: ``Let me now turn to the 
presidency of the European Commission. The treaty lays down 
that the Commission President should be selected by `common 
accord' to serve a term of five years. Common accord is vital. 
For the President of the Commission to serve the whole 
Community effectively, he must enjoy the confidence and support 
of all of its members. 
  ``Before the Corfu Council, we told the presidency and other 
partners that we supported Sir Leon Brittan's candidature; and 
believed that a genuine consensus of all 12 member states to be 
essential. No one disputed the necessity of a genuine 
consensus. 
  ``When we heard that Mr Dehaene was thinking of putting 
himself forward at a late stage, we privately informed the 
Belgian Government and other partners that we could not support 
him. We warned that it would not be possible for him to attract 
a consensus of the whole community. We hoped, therefore, that 
his candidature would not be pressed. 
  ``Neither then nor at any later stage did any partner say 
that either Sir Leon Brittan or Dr Lubbers, the two 
long-standing candidates, was unacceptable. Both, of course, had 
outstanding credentials and long experience of the community -- 
Sir Leon Brittan as a Commissioner for six years and Dr Lubbers 
from 12 years on the European Council. 
  ``At the Corfu Council, four states -- representing nearly 
half of the community's EU population -- did not support Mr 
Dehaene in the long discussion on the first evening. In several 
interventions, I made our strong views very clear to the 
Council, as I had in a number of bilateral discussions. 
  ``On the following morning, Sir Leon Brittan and Dr Lubbers 
decided to withdraw their candidatures. Other European 
countries indicated that they could accept Mr Dehaene. I 
maintained my position that we could not. I said that I had 
given the matter careful thought and that our decision would not 
change at any stage. I reiterate that position in this House 
today. I suggested that consultation should be put in hand to 
find a candidate who had the support of all. The German 
Chancellor, who takes over the presidency later this week, said 
he hoped to resolve the matter quickly, if necessary by 
convening a special summit on July 15.'' 
  Mr Major insisted: ``Our position was not a personal 
criticism of Mr Dehaene, although in our view Sir Leon and Dr 
Lubbers had much stronger qualifications. For the next five 
years the Commission needs a President who is in tune with the 
times and the mood across Europe, a President whose instincts 
are with enterprise and competitiveness. Above all, Europe 
needs a President of the Commission selected with the full 
approval of all member states. 
  ``The Corfu Council has highlighted an issue of increasing 
concern to many EU members -- that issue is the way in which 
decisions are reached. It is an important point of principle 
that the key decisions require unanimity and that all member 
states should have an equal opportunity to participate in 
collective decision-making. The procedures used for this 
decision, before and during the Council, were not satisfactory. 
  ``There was no need for this matter to have come to an open 
division at a European Council. It should have been avoided. 
Had more comprehensive consultation taken place, as in the 
past, and had the views expressed by different states been 
heeded, it could have been avoided. 
  ``I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people 
who could take on this post, on the basis of a genuinely common 
accord. We stand ready to play our part in consultations on it. 
There is no reason why this should not lead to an early and 
satisfactory outcome. 
  ``I want Europe to succeed. I want it to regain the 
affections of the people of Europe. I want a Europe with which 
all member states -- soon to be 16, then 20 -- can feel 
comfortable. Achieving that may mean disputes along the way. 
But being a good European does not mean signing up to 
everything which our partners propose. At Corfu we fought for 
what we believe is in the best interests of this country and of 
Europe. That is what we will continue to do.''

<F P=106> [By James Hardy, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] European countries pressing for greater state 
interference in economic and social issues were today given a 
blunt "hands off" warning by Treasury Chief Secretary Michael 
Portillo. He said government intervention was damaging to 
individual freedom and economic efficiency. 
  Mr Portillo's comments to Spanish business leaders in 
Barcelona were being seen at Westminster as a veiled message to 
Brussels bureaucrats to back away from their long tradition of 
greater centralisation and regulation. He said governments 
should confine themselves to creating conditions which helped 
ordinary citizens generate wealth for their countries. 
  Pressure to block free trade through protectionism presented 
particularly grave dangers to prosperity. "It has recently 
been argued that the free market is a jungle to be tamed by 
governments -- it is at least as plausible to argue that 
governments are a jungle to be tamed by the free market," he 
said. 
  The majority of emerging democracies were embracing free 
market principles of deregulation, competition, privatisation 
and low tariffs on imports. "They see the connection between 
economic freedom and political freedom clearly. So must we," 
said Mr Portillo. 
  "We must apply our understanding of the link to our trade 
policy. That is a difficult challenge for European governments. 
We must be suspicious of arguments that urge us to impede 
trade in order to drive up health and safety standards or 
environmental standards in developing countries." 
  European experience showed the wealth of nations was best 
increased through trade between them. ``We want to see a 
free-trading Europe as a prelude to ever-increasing global free 
trade. There would be no sense in creating the Single European 
Market if we are not going to extend its principles globally. 
  ``The arguments that apply to individual nations apply to 
Europe as a whole. If we surround ourselves with barriers to 
trade, we shall saddle our consumers with higher prices and our 
productive industries with dead wood. To be a good European you 
have to know that there is a world beyond Europe.''

  [Text] The Royal Navy's newest warship, HMS Somerset, was 
launched on the Clyde today. 
  Officers from half-a-dozen of the world's navies, more than 
200 guests and thousands of spectators watched the grey-painted 
Type 23 frigate go down the slipway at Yarrow Shipbuilders into 
the Upper Clyde. 
  HMS Somerset is the seventh Type 23, or "Duke" Class, 
frigate 
to be launched at Yarrow and will be delivered in spring 1996. 
  She was launched by Lady Layard, wife of Admiral Sir Michael 
Layard, Second Sea Lord, and is the fourth Royal Navy ship to 
bear the name. 
  HMS Somerset's primary role will be submarine detection and 
she will be equipped with the EH101 helicopter and torpedoes. 
Her surface armament consists of Harpoon missiles and a 4.5in 
gun. 
  She will also be defended by the vertically-launched Seawolf 
anti-missile system and small calibre guns. 
  The latest HMS Somerset, which is 440ft long and weighs 
3,500 
tonnes, was built in six months less than the first Type 23 
frigate completed at Yarrow. 
  Yarrow has five frigates to complete by 1997 -- three for 
the Royal Navy and two for Malaysia.

  [Text] London, June 23, IRNA -- The BBC's launch this week 
of an Arabic television news service has brought into question 
how much editorial influence has been granted in its pact with 
Orbit Communication. Orbit, owned by Prince Khalid 'Abdallah, 
is reported to be planning to charge viewers 10,000 dinars for 
the decoders needed to receive its 20 entertainment channels and 
the BBC news programs that is seen serving only sheiks and rich 
business persons. 
  According to the London GUARDIAN, many Arabs are also 
wondering how free the BBC will be, given that its partner is a 
distant cousin of King Fahd. 
  The royal family already dominates the media in Saudi 
Arabia, 
owns the two leading pan-Arabic dailies, a satellite network 
covering the region and the international UPI news agency. 
Plans are said to be also underway for a new pan-Arab FM radio 
station. 
  As one of the most rigidly censored areas in the world, the 
decision by the BBC is seen as potentially its most 
controversial venture in news satellite broadcasting. 
  BBC World Service Radio, funded by the Foreign Office, is 
recognized for its sensitive handling of news on Saudi Arabia, 
which is Britain's largest arms market, but executives are 
claiming there have been no concessions on its Arabic tv service. 
  Orbit was said to have been given no editorial influence, 
even although Saudi Arabia has been leading many Arab 
governments against the march of global Westernized culture. 
  The London GUARDIAN also identified that Orbit's access to 
new cable newtorks is through a "filtering" system, whereby 
there is a delay between the time signals are received and then 
transmitted to viewers. The Saudi policy has always been to 
carefully screen out any material that is objectionable, which 
will put an extra onus on BBC transmissions if it is to abide by 
its claim of not allowing any tampering of its news service.

<F P=106> [Report by Nur-al-Din al-Furaydi: "Algerian Prime Minister </F>
in Belgium; He Has Been Informed of Support for Dialogue and 
Reforms"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi 
has confirmed the U.S. Administration's and the European Union's 
support for the political dialogue and economic reforms 
endeavors Algerian authorities are making. In an exclusive 
statement to AL-HAYAH following a meeting he held at noon on 
Tuesday [21 June] with his Belgian opposite number, Jean-Luc 
Dehaene, who is nominated to succeed [European] Commission 
President Jacques Delors, he said that Foreign Minister Mohamed 
Salah Dembri, who is currently in the United States, has 
informed him of the support of President Bill Clinton's 
administration for the Algerian Government's endeavors vis-a-vis 
the political dialogue with all the parties renouncing violence 
as a means to reach power. [passage omitted] 
  In his statement to AL-HAYAH Mokdad Sifi stressed his 
government's determination to continue the political dialogue. 
He indicated that he is not banking on achieving a political 
"miracle" in the near future, "because dialogue is a long 
process and requires time. And the Algerian Government is 
awaiting the participation of the parties which have been late" 
in joining the Transitional National Council. 
  On the continuation of the dialogue with the detained 
Islamic 
Salvation Front leaders, Mokdad Sifi said that the Transitional 
Council "is the framework organizing the dialogue among the 
parties and influential figures who respect the Constitution and 
the country's laws and who openly declare their renunciation of 
violence. The dialogue is aimed at committing all parties in 
the country to working to improve the economic and social 
situation so that Algerians can proceed with free and democratic 
elections as soon as possible in order to choose the men who are 
going to lead the country, God willing." 
  Mokdad Sifi met the day before yesterday with members of the 
Algerian community in Brussels. He answered questions some of 
which dealt with the situation in the country. He told an 
elderly immigrant: "Power is for the people and God." And that 
the current leadership is supervising a transitional phase to 
normalize the political situation and reform the economy, then 
hold free parliamentary elections. 
  On the contacts made between Islamic Front [leaders] in 
exile 
and some European capitals and Washington, Sifi said that the 
official U.S. position announced by President Bill Clinton in 
Paris "condemns violence and supports the dialogue the Algerian 
Government is leading. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri, 
who is currently in Washington, has stressed in contacts with 
him that the U.S. Administration fully supports the Algerian 
Government's endeavors vis-a-vis the political dialogue and 
economic reforms." 
  He pointed out that the European Union has "on numerous 
occasions supported the Algerian Government's endeavors in the 
economic and political spheres." He said that he had raised 
with his Belgian opposite number prospects for relations between 
the European Union and Algeria "in a manner that takes account 
of current changes in Algeria. And there is political consensus 
with the Belgian prime minister that the European Union's 
borders do not end at the northern waters of the Mediterranean 
and that there can be no southern bank without the Arab Maghreb, 
in which Algeria represents a major party." He said that they 
are agreed that "the situation in Algeria affects Europe at all 
levels, economic, political, and geopolitical." [passage 
omitted] 
  Sifi said that the agreements Algeria has signed with the 
IMF 
will save until next May the payment of $5 billion. He pointed 
out that loans his country is going to obtain from international 
monetary establishment, commercial banks, and the European Union 
"will enable it to import raw material to revive the economy and 
to import consumer goods." He expected economic growth to reach 
3 percent this year and 6 percent next year. He pointed to the 
importance of the projects of reactivating small and medium 
establishments, agricultural investment, and building dams and 
houses, and also major projects like constructing 3,000-km-long 
railroads, as these projects will increase employment 
opportunities. 
  Sifi said that the government has taken measures which have 
received the IMF's approval to protect social groups with 
limited income against the consequences that usually result from 
the process of liberalizing the economy, especially in the areas 
of housing, education, and health. And to control the prices of 
some basic commodities. The European Commission will donate 
grants to finance projects that will help the government to 
implement the public housing program. The Algerian Government 
is banking on increasing gas imports in the long term from the 
current rate of 30 billion to 60 billion cubic meters by 1998 -- 
which would secure additional financial revenue to finance the 
development program.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference given by Defense Minister Volker </F>
Ruehe and French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, by Christine 
Heuer with unidentified announcer, in Bonn on 27 June] 
  [Text] [Announcer] On the occasion of the presentation of 
his new book, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe met with his French 
counterpart Francois Leotard in Bonn today. However, the 
reporters who attended the presentation were much more 
interested in asking the two ministers about the French 
intervention in the civil war in Rwanda and a possible German 
commitment there. Did the two minister provide comprehensive 
answers to these questions? 
  [Heuer] Well, Francois Leotard did not answer at all. 
Volker Ruehe was apparently very reluctant to reply to 
questions about Rwanda. He was very reserved, referring to the 
fact that one must await the ruling by the Constitutional Court 
on the participation of German soldiers abroad and saying that 
he had merely asked his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, to 
brief him on the situation in Rwanda. 
  [Begin Ruehe recording] The Constitutional Court ruling, due 
on 12 July, is to be given absolute priority. By the way, we 
have made it very clear -- also by providing material support -- 
that we are ready to provide humanitarian aid if certain 
preconditions exist. [end recording] 
  [Heuer] Ruehe's statement confirmed the well-known position 
of the Federal Government. Bonn is only prepared to permit 
German soldiers to participate in humanitarian missions in 
Rwanda under UN sponsorship if the security situation is checked 
by the United Nations in Kigali and found to be such that the 
involvement of German Bundeswehr soldiers in hostilities can be 
ruled out. 
  The second topic was the participation of German soldiers in 
the parade on the Champs Elysee in Paris on 12 July. Both 
ministers commented on this issue. Volker Ruehe explicitly 
conveyed thanks for the French invitation to the Germans. 
Francois Leotard stressed that the German soldiers are to take 
part within the framework of the Eurocorps. Asked about 
criticism of the German participation in the parade, expressed 
by members of the French Resistance, the French defense minister 
said it should not be overvalued. 
  [Begin Leotard recording, in French with superimposed German 
translation] It is true that protests were expressed initially. 
However, they mainly came from political parties -- from the 
Communist Party. Some of the protests also result from internal 
French quarrels. The attitude of the majority of the French 
population is absolutely positive. Personally I believe that, 
generally, the French are glad that this Eurocorp, which 
includes German soldiers, has an opportunity to present itself 
on the Champs Elysee. [end recording] 
  [Heuer] Thus, against this backdrop, Leotard naturally ruled 
out active protest by the French side on 14 July.

  [Excerpts] [Unidentified announcer] Finland, Sweden, 
Norway, and Austria signed the European Union [EU] membership 
agreement at the EU summit in Corfu about half an hour ago. 
According to President Martti Ahtisaari it is important that 
the EU develops in the interests of its citizens. Speaking a 
little while ago in Corfu at the signing ceremony of the new 
members of the EU, President Ahtisaari thought that the greatest 
challenge is for the EU to develop in line with the citizens' 
wishes. 
  This is Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari's speech in its 
entirety: 
  [Begin Ahtisaari recording] Honored chairman of the Council 
of Europe, honored chairman of the Commission, honored chairman 
of the European Parliament, honored ladies and gentlemen. 
  I have great pleasure in witnessing this historic signing 
ceremony. This is an important day, not only for Finland and 
the other countries seeking membership but also for the history 
of the whole of Europe. We have today taken a considerable step 
in strengthening the economic and political integration of our 
continent. I want to express a warm thank you on behalf of the 
Finnish Government to you, Mr. Prime Minister, on the resolute 
work the EU under the presidency of Greece has carried out in 
bringing the Finnish membership negotiations to a positive 
conclusion. I also want to thank other member countries of the 
Union, the Commission, and the secretariat of the Union for the 
respect shown toward Finland during the negotiations. 
  We greatly appreciate that the European Parliament, with a 
great majority, approved our membership. The negotiations 
result reached will offer a good basis for Finland's membership 
in the EU. In order to take care -- without big problems -- of 
the changes the membership will bring, especially in the 
countryside and in the outlying regions in Finland, the Finnish 
Government has made a decision on national measures that will 
soften the current changes and make the long-term adaptation 
easier. 
  Debate among citizens on membership in the EU has been 
lively 
in Finland. The debate has brought up, among other things, the 
citizens' concerns about the right to take part, about the 
preservation of the Nordic way of life, and about environmental 
protection. 
  The EU is a central factor in strengthening the security of 
our continent. The security will be enhanced by social 
responsibility, interaction between people, respect of human 
rights and economic well being. This kind of Europe does not 
have economic or social divisions but all states have equal 
rights to take part in the integration development. The 
expansion of the Union supports the positive development of the 
stability of the whole continent. Finland supports the Union's 
economic and political aims. Finland's membership would 
strengthen the northern dimension of the Union, I am convinced 
that this would give the Union extra strength both economically 
and politically. It is very important that the Union will 
develop to benefit its citizens, according to their conditions. 
This is the great challenge in developing the EU in the future. 
[passage omitted] 
  As a member of the EU, Finland wants to give its 
contribution 
toward its' development. We see the future of the Union as a 
tolerant and secure community bringing together the nations and 
citizens of the whole continent, where every citizen of the 
Union feels that the Union is his or her own. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] This was President Martti Ahtisaari. [passage 
omitted] 
  The EU membership documents were signed on Finland's behalf 
by Prime Minister Esko Aho, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto, 
Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, and Secretary of State 
Veli Sundbaeck. The signing means that Finland will become an 
active partner in the EU's work, however, without the authority 
to make decisions so far. The change will show in the fact that 
in the first session of the Corfu summit in the early afternoon, 
President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Aho will sit at the 
summit table with the leaders of the EU countries. 
  It seems so far that President Ahtisaari will have one 
bilateral meeting at the Corfu summit. He will have talks in 
the afternoon with Austrian President Thomas Klestil. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in his </F>
office, by Arlette Chabot and Alain Duhamel -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Chabot] Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. We 
are going to look together at the reports from our special 
correspondents in Rwanda. I will, of course, ask you first of 
all to tell us how you assess the beginning of Operation 
Turquoise, is it going as you hoped, and it is slightly better 
understood today, in your opinion? 
  [Balladur] I believe so. I believe so. Why did we decide to 
launch this operation in Rwanda? Because the whole world, the 
whole of France was moved, shaken by the pictures which we saw, 
and it seemed to us that the French Government could not remain 
indifferent or inactive, and thus that France, along with others 
-- but with France taking the initiative -- should organize an 
international humanitarian operation. 
  Having said that, it was necessary to take precautions in 
order not to be dragged into what is a internal civil war in 
Rwanda. That is why we established a certain number of 
principles, which I outlined to the National Assembly: We are 
there to carry out a humanitarian operation and for this reason 
alone; we are there for a limited period of time; we are waiting 
for reinforcements from other nations, and we hope that by the 
end of July the United Nations will take over from us. 
  [Duhamel] A question everyone is wondering about in this 
case 
is that, since, as unfortunately everyone has seen, there have 
been appalling massacres, and no doubt hundreds of thousands of 
people have been killed, why were we not able to make this 
decision earlier? 
  [Balladur] I believe it is better to have made it when we 
did 
than not to have made it at all. Obviously, we could have made 
it earlier, you are right, Alain Duhamel, we could have made it 
earlier, we could have made it sooner. 
  We made a certain number of contacts beforehand, but in the 
end it appeared to us that we were going to have to set the 
example, and this is what we did, but at the same time we had to 
take precautions to avoid our soldiers being needlessly put into 
dangerous situations. So, I repeat, there is no question of 
their taking part in the internal fighting, there is no question 
of their becoming a buffer force. They are there for a 
humanitarian purpose for a limited period of time, and for this 
alone, and I hope that the example which France is setting will 
stimulate other countries around the world to ensure that others 
quickly take over. 
  [Chabot] You say that in fact the French troops are not 
there 
to form a buffer force or to take part in the fighting, but what 
happens if, for example, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
advances, takes Kigali, and in advancing they come extremely 
close to the French troops. How are they to react? 
  [Balladur] We will review the situation at that time. I 
would note one thing: The RPF which was very reticent -- not to 
use a stronger expression -- with regard to the French 
operation, has been saying for the last 24 hours that it 
realizes that we are there for a humanitarian purpose, for a 
humanitarian purpose alone, and that under these circumstances 
it had fewer reservations -- I am not saying that it approves of 
it, but that it had fewer reservations -- concerning the 
operation which we are carrying out. 
  [Duhamel] Can one say that with regard to the question of 
the 
French humanitarian operation in Rwanda, there is complete 
agreement between the president and the government, point by 
point? 
  [Balladur] I spoke with the president about it, about 10 
days 
or so ago, I think, and we both agreed that there was good 
reason for intervention, and we defined the mission together in 
a perfectly precise way in order not to be dragged -- and this 
was my express wish -- not to be dragged in any further than 
necessary. 
  [Duhamel] A question which is often asked is that France -- 
and you are no doubt going to tell me that this was in the days 
before your government, but in any case France had, let us say, 
good relations with the previous government in Rwanda, and it 
was the henchmen of this previous government who behaved in an 
appalling manner. In your opinion, do we basically bear a 
portion of indirect responsibility? 
  [Balladur] No, I do not believe so, and, furthermore one of 
our first actions, 48 hours ago, was to go to the assistance of 
the Tutsis, to clearly demonstrate that our goal was to carry 
out an operation aimed at defending everyone. We do not want to 
take sides with one against another. 
  [Chabot] Are not some people saying basically with regard to 
this operation in Rwanda, perhaps we could do some thinking 
about France's policy in Africa and what kind of cooperation we 
should be giving? Does this in fact seem to you to be an 
occasion for doing some thinking about that? 
  [Balladur] It is certainly an occasion for doing some 
thinking, but, you know, things are clear and straightforward: 
France aspires to be a world power. This is its ambition and 
its pride, and I want it to maintain this ambition, and the main 
sphere of its action is Africa, where, according to a tradition 
which now dates back many years, it has a distinguished role to 
play, especially in francophone Africa, so, because it is 
Africa, because Rwanda is a francophone country, we could not 
remain indifferent. However, we have to define and conduct this 
operation in such a way that we are not dragged in any further 
than we wish. [passage omitted] 
  [Duhamel] You have known Jacques Delors for a long time, 
for at least a quarter of a century? 
  [Balladur] Yes, for a good 30 years. 
  [Duhamel] Do you think that he would be a fierce contender 
for the candidate or the candidates of the majority, whether you 
are one or not? 
  [Balladur] I do not have any judgement to pass on this. 
  [Chabot] Would you like him, for instance, to stay in 
Brussels -- as some of the European Union [EU] do, the Greek 
Government for instance, who yesterday asked him to do so 
because there is a difficult succession problem? Do you think 
that this is a good idea? 
  [Balladur] If I did, what conclusions would you draw and 
which ulterior motives would you attribute to me? 
  [Chabot] About the EU... 
  [Balladur, interrupting] I believe that we have dwelt on the 
subject at length. 
  [Duhamel] About Europe, there has been a summit. This summit 
stumbled on one point, the election of Jacques Delors' 
successor. Could they [changes thought] there were 11 countries, 
including France, which agreed that the Belgian prime minister 
should succeed Jacques Delors. There was one country, Great 
Britain, which opposed this. Would it be conceivable to have 
new conditions: one country against 11? 
  [Balladur] I cannot answer you just like that, Alain 
Duhamel, 
you will understand that. What is needed, I think, is for us to 
reach a general agreement and I hope that each and every one 
will be aware of what is at stake. The stake is that Europe 
must not appear to be divided: People would not understand it. 
There is a candidate, who received a very significant number of 
votes. He is a very competent and valued candidate. 
  [Duhamel] The Belgian prime minister, Mr. Jean-Luc Dehaene. 
  [Balladur] This is all I have to say. I hope that this issue 
will be settled on good terms, I do not like personality 
conflicts on the whole. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that 
the Greek EU [European Union] presidency in Corfu sought the 
best regarding Cyprus' accession in the EU, which was the 
beginning of official negotiations to achieve Cyprus' 
participation in the next EU enlargement. This goal, he said, 
is considered realistically positive. Evaluating Greece's 
handling of the issue during the EU summit in Corfu, Kasoulidhis 
added that it became clear that the reason no date for the 
beginning of accession talks was given was not due to the 
developments in the Cyprus issue but to the internal structural 
changes that will take place within the Union. Kasoulidhis 
repeated that the decisions made in Corfu represent a 
significant step in Cyprus' move for accession into the EU, and 
added that the next step is the establishment of a date for 
accession talks. 
  AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] says in a 
statement that the government's triumphant statements regarding 
the decisions made in Corfu are not justified because the goal 
for the appointment of a date for the beginning of accession 
talks for Cyprus has not been achieved. Instead, AKEL says, 
there is a general position that Cyprus will be involved in the 
next expansion stage, without anyone knowing under what 
conditions and when the next expansion will take place. AKEL 
also notes that the conclusion, that the EU has disassociated 
the direction of Cyprus' accession from the Cyprus issue, is 
arbitrary. 
  Government spokesman Kasoulidhis commented on AKEL's 
statement about the decisions made in Corfu, and noted that the 
government does not make triumphant statements, in comparison 
with AKEL which speaks of disasters, as he put it, for every 
positive step for Cyprus. Kasoulidhis added that one additional 
reason that AKEL undermines the importance of the decisions made 
in Corfu is that because of the policies it followed, it was the 
main reason for the delay in the submission of Cyprus' 
application for accession under the presidency of Yeoryios 
Vasiliou. 
  A statement issued by socialist party EDEK [United 
Democratic 
Union of Cyprus] expresses satisfaction, because the decision of 
the EU summit in Corfu does not associate Cyprus' move toward 
accession in the EU with the move to solve the Cyprus issue, and 
because the next stage of EU expansion will include Cyprus and 
Malta. EDEK adds that now there is a need for a real crusade by 
all forces in Cyprus and Greece in view of the EU summit next 
January so that a decision for the beginning of accession talks 
will be made. Finally, EDEK expresses gratitude to the Greek 
Government for the fight [on behalf of Cyprus] in the Corfu 
summit. 
  The Free Democrats Movement issued a statement regarding the 
reference to Cyprus and Malta in the final communique of the EU 
summit in Corfu, which it describes as a positive development. 
However, it adds that it has been greatly exaggerated. In the 
statement, the Free Democrats Movement stresses that there is no 
final decision for Cyprus' accession during the next expansion 
as Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis had said. The statement 
also notes that the claim for disassociation of the Cyprus issue 
from that of accession is not true. It adds that the EU 
Commission's position, that Cyprus' application will be 
reexamined in January 1995 in light of developments in the 
Cyprus issue, is still in effect.

  [Text] Ankara, June 28 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin met French Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Bertrand 
Dufourcq, who is currently in Ankara for political talks between 
Turkey and France, it was reported on Monday [27 June]. 
  Dufourcq said after the meeting that France will do its best 
to improve relations between Turkey and the European Union [EU] 
and try to create concrete conditions. Dufourcq also said Greek 
Cypriots have the right to apply for EU membership. "However, 
expanding the Union will be discussed after a process of 
reviewing several institutions in the Union," he said. Asked if 
France will attend a tripartite meeting that is scheduled to be 
held between Turkey, Germany, and Britain's attendance, Dufourcq 
said, "We have been invited and we want to participate in the 
meeting." 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials briefing on a meeting 
between Dufourcq and Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ozdem 
Sanberk said bilateral relations were discussed. 
  It was also reported that the two undersecretaries discussed 
about privatization and increasing French investments in Turkey 
was also in the meeting agenda. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said France and the Union did not 
have the attitude to accept Greek-Cypriots to the Union. 
Officials said Turkey conveyed the French side that Greek 
Cypriot side, who is already making use of the existing 
situation, would exploit the membership if the Union accepted 
the Greek Cypriots to the Union.

<F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "British Veto Triggers Severe </F>
Crisis in EU"] 
  [Excerpts] Bonn -- Following the failed attempt to appoint 
a new European Commission president at the summit on the Greek 
island of Corfu due to the British Government's stubbornness, 
government circles in Bonn are preparing to have to find a 
completely new candidate to succeed outgoing Jacques Delors. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bonn says that Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to stick 
to the candidate of his choice for the time being; but as yet, 
Kohl has not found a solution for the special summit either. 
Bonn circles regard former Belgian Prime Minister Wifried 
Martens as a "hot tip." The 58-year-old Flemish Christian 
Democrat is chairman of the European People's Party. 
  Members of the delegation accompanying Kohl to the Corfu 
summit say that Major probably rejected Dehaene mainly because 
he fears he might promote European integration too much for 
Britain's liking. Following the devastating defeat Major's 
Conservative Party suffered in the European elections, the prime 
minister's statement that he will not change his mind over the 
next four weeks is considered credible. Kohl, therefore, does 
not want to provoke the British Government, but rather to try to 
have intensive talks with London in order to find a joint 
solution.

<F P=106> [Report by Edgar Auth: "NATO Reaction Force Put Into </F>
Service"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 23 Jun -- The Multinational 
Division, whose staff (leadership) is deployed in Rheindahlen 
near Moenchengladbach, views itself as a "milestone in the 
history of NATO and multinational cooperation." The armies from 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Germany participate 
with one brigade each in this "Multinational Division-Central" 
[MND(C)], announced Lieutenant Colonel Ernst-August Petermann, 
the press officer. Each of the four countries involved provides 
a quarter of the staff members, and the position of the 
commander in chief is subject to the principle of rotation. The 
first commander in chief is Major General Pieter Huysman from 
the Netherlands. His deputy is from Great Britain. 
  Depending on the kind of operation, the MND(C) can comprise 
up to 20,000 men, Petermann pointed out. It is designed for 
various kinds of operations: humanitarian aid, disaster aid, 
safeguarding of peace, and "peacemaking measures if need be" -- 
that is combat missions -- the press release stated. Petermann 
considers putting the division into service a "political issue." 
He admitted that international operations will continue to be 
controversial in Germany until the Constitutional Court passes a 
ruling on the participation of the Bundeswehr in out-of-area 
operations. In the event of a negative ruling, "we might have 
to kick the Germans out again," Petermann told FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU. The lieutenant general would consider it "extremely 
embarrassing" if the division one day had to be deployed without 
German soldiers. Above all, the lack of a quarter of the 
leadership would cause big problems, he stated. 
  The Bundeswehr has placed the 31st Airborne Brigade from 
Oldenburg at the disposal of the MND(C). According to 
Petermann, this brigade also includes a normal number of 
conscripts. The main parts of the division are easily 
transferrable. The Netherlands provides artillery, Belgium 
combat helicopters, and Germany transportation helicopters and a 
service battalion. 
  Petermann announced that NATO has been planning to set up 
such a force since the middle of the 1980s. At the time of the 
East-West confrontation it was intended as a mobile reserve unit 
in the event of an attack by a Warsaw Pact state.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Russian forces today bade 
farewell to Berliners with a military parade to mark their 
departure from Germany. Taking part in the parade in the east 
Berlin district of Koepenick were 1,500 soldiers of the 6th 
Motorized Rifle Brigade, which has been stationed in Berlin for 
49 years. About 20,000 of the capital's inhabitants and their 
guests lined the street to witness this historic event. A large 
number of honored guests, among them the Russian ambassador to 
Germany and representatives of the former Western allies and the 
Bundeswehr, viewed the parade of the Berlin Brigade, as it is 
known, from the VIP rostrum. 
  In his speech, Mayor Eberhard Diepgen said the Berliners and 
the Russian forces leaving the city were parting in friendship. 
The mayor said he hoped many of the soldiers now returning to 
their homeland would come back to Berlin. "We want to remain 
good neighbors and friends," he said. Diepgen recalled that the 
Russians had first come to Germany, with many losses and 
sacrifices, 50 years previously as victors and liberators from 
National Socialism with the Western allies. That will remain 
their historic achievement. Since then there have been "good 
and bad days," and there had often been "difficult times," 
Diepgen went on. He paid tribute to the "special services" which 
the Western Group of Russian forces had rendered in the days of 
the peaceful revolution in eastern Germany. Colonel General 
Matvey Burlakov, supreme commander of the Western Group of 
Russian forces in Germany, said the Berlin Brigade is the last 
unit of Russian troops to leave German territory. He had a 
"feeling of mission accomplished." Burlakov said that the 
departure of Russian troops is proceeding exactly according to 
schedule. Approximately 98 percent of the 500,000 men, the 
123,000 weapons and pieces of equipment, and around 2.6 million 
tonnes of material has already been withdrawn over the past 
three-and-a-half years. This process will be completed by the 
end of August. The joy at returning to the homeland is, 
however, mixed with sadness at saying farewell to the befriended 
German people, Burlakov said. 
  The program was staged by the company forming the honor 
guard 
and the Western Group of Forces military orchestra. The Berlin 
Brigade sang "Farewell Germany" in German and Russian. This was 
followed by a performance by the Western Group's song and dance 
company.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Bernd Schmidbauer, state minister </F>
in the Chancellor's Office, by Udo Ulfkotte in Bonn on 22 June: 
"`Russia Pursuing Aggressive Spying Activities'"] 
  [Text] Even after the end of the East-West conflict, the 
FRG remains the main target of eastern espionage. While some 
countries of the former Eastern Bloc, such as Hungary, have 
reduced their intelligence activities in Germany considerably, 
Russia is "now, as then, pursuing very aggressive spying 
activities, particularly in the military sphere." This was said 
by State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who is responsible for 
coordinating the intelligence services in the Federal 
Chancellor's Office, in an interview with FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE. Schmidbauer called on Russia to also adapt its 
intelligence efforts to the changed political situation. The 
"methods of the Cold War" must be "reduced step by step." We 
have "not noticed anything yet" regarding the "necessary drastic 
reduction" in Russia's intelligence activities in Germany, the 
state minister said. 
  The Federal Intelligence Service [BND] office in Moscow -- 
one of more than 70 BND facilities in other countries -- was 
trying to increase cooperation with Russian intelligence 
services for the fight against organized crime and the 
prevention of nuclear smuggling. In the past few years, the BND 
has been able to get an insight into the logistics of those 
eastern smugglers that want to sell weapons-grade nuclear 
material on the European market. It is in this sphere that 
cooperation with the eastern intelligence services is beginning 
"to work." The BND has repeatedly "uncovered the smuggling of 
nuclear material" without informing the public. In most cases, 
the nuclear material appeared only in small quantities, mostly 
samples. In the past few years there has "hardly been a sphere 
in which the BND's effectiveness could not be proved 
convincingly," Schmidbauer said. It is due to the BND's 
activities that there was "not a second al-Rabitah," and in the 
"Mykonos trial" in Berlin the "BND's contribution has also been 
obvious." 
  As a result of the changed situation after the end of the 
East-West conflict, the tasks have become more varied for the 
BND. Apart from proliferation, organized crime, money 
laundering, refugee smuggling and narcotics trade had become new 
areas in which the German intelligence services have become 
active. "Those who are aware of the increase in such crimes in 
those spheres know that, without the necessary information on 
the logistics and the background of these criminal 
organizations, we are unable to develop sensible defense 
strategies at home," Schmidbauer said. The new tasks of the BND 
require new investments as a result of the advance in 
technology. The participation in an intelligence satellite 
alone will "cost several hundred millions of German marks." The 
ultimate decision on Germany's participation in the French or 
the U.S. project is still pending. The decisionmaking process 
will involve fundamental issues in terms of security, foreign, 
economic, and research policy. While the U.S. satellites that 
are used for military purposes are said to have a resolution of 
30 centimeters, most maps in the BND archives in Pullach have a 
resolution of only 10 meters. Cuts in BND personnel have 
reached the "absolute limit." The objective is to streamline 
the administration by 1996/97 and recruit "new experts in the 
spheres of organized crime, money laundering, and the narcotics 
trade." 
  Asked whether, apart from Iran, the BND had relations with 
other countries suspected of supporting international terrorism, 
too, Schmidbauer said: "Intelligence services must have such 
contacts. They must conduct critical dialogue. They must get 
information. They are involved in the fates of abducted Germans 
or Germans in captivity. We cannot always chose our partners in 
the talks. A lot of what we describe as critical dialogue has 
yielded positive results -- for German citizens abroad, for the 
liberation of hostages, for the search of terrorists even on our 
own territory. We have to rely on such contacts." 
  Of the about 6,500 BND employees, 3,500 are working in the 
headquarters at Pullach; others work in the 70 branch offices 
abroad (from Prague to Moscow and Damascus) or other facilities 
in Germany. The BND collects at least 80 percent of its 
information from open sources, mainly newspapers: from 1.5 
million reports per year. Compared to that, "human sources" 
provide "only" about 80,000 reports, and technological 
intelligence provides some 100,000 reports. Moreover, there are 
about 12,000 documents provided by ambassadors each year and the 
reports from about 200 other intelligence services in the world 
with which the BND cooperates. On the basis of the huge amount 
of material collected, analysts in Pullach issue publications 
that are distributed to ministries, the Bundeswehr, and others 
with the note VS [Verschlussache -- classified document]. BND 
agents have told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that the procurement of 
military material from abroad "has always helped" to lower the 
enormous costs of the Defense Ministry, for example when "one 
got hold of Russian tanks of the most recent design," which were 
then tested for their vulnerability.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Chairman Klaus Kinkel has described the defeat of the liberals 
at the state parliament elections in Saxony-Anhalt as "bitter." 
Kinkel said today on the fringes of a meeting of the FDP 
executive in Bonn that the party's overall image had not been 
good in recent months. However, the FDP at land level 
[Saxony-Anhalt FDP] had also contributed to the election defeat. 
  Kinkel announced a "motivation campaign" by the FDP at 
national level for the summer, but also particularly in the 
regional associations in Saxony, Bavaria, and Brandenburg where 
landtag elections are still to take place. The aim is to lay 
greater emphasis on the function and policies of the FDP under 
the motto "Germany needs the liberals."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister and FDP Chairman Klaus </F>
Kinkel by Nikolaus Brender and Gerhard Fuchs; place not given -- 
live; correspondents are not identified individually] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, ever since you assumed 
office the Free Democratic Party [FDP] has suffered losses -- in 
Lower Saxony, in Hamburg, at the European elections, and in 
Saxony-Anhalt. Now the Bundestag elections are due in October. 
  [Kinkel] We will not lose there. I am sure we will have 
good results. However, there is no doubt that we have suffered 
bitter defeats -- particularly yesterday, the defeat in 
Saxony-Anhalt. There are no extenuating circumstances. You can 
imagine that I am not happy but, as party chairman, I would have 
wished for a bit more luck. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, are you absolutely sure that you 
will still be leading the party into the Bundestag election 
campaign as chairman? The secretary general of the biggest land 
association, the one in North Rhine-Westphalia, has called for a 
special congress, where one, as he said, also has to talk about 
the people at the head of the party, because of the 
above-mentioned election defeats. As a result, there can no 
longer be any taboos. Could the taboo be Kinkel? Does Kinkel 
have to go? 
  [Kinkel] No. I have just returned from Paris, where I made 
my first trip in connection with Germany's forthcoming European 
Union presidency. I visited the French prime minister and 
foreign minister. 
  [Correspondent] But there you will not win any elections. 
  [Kinkel] But I only have just heard that the North 
Rhine-Westphalian Land association made this demand this 
morning, which has meanwhile probably been rescinded again. 
  [Correspondent] Count Lambsdorff sees the FDP in existential 
danger. This morning the other honorary chairman, Mr. Genscher, 
said that strategic mistakes have been committed in the FDP. 
You are the chairman of the party. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, as chairman one has indeed to take the blame 
for everything, even though one is not responsible for 
everything. However, I do not want to evade anything. I have to 
share responsibility even though, if we look at Saxony-Anhalt, I 
would say in all modesty that a lot there was homemade. 
However, we in Bonn, the federal party, also made mistakes. 
  By the way, I would still like to answer the question I have 
not answered yet. Yes, I will certainly lead the FDP into this 
year's Bundestag election campaign. 
  [Correspondent] Will this be the last election campaign, as 
a result of which you may no longer be represented in parliament? 
  [Kinkel] No, I repeat again that I am very sure that the FDP 
will be in the Bundestag. There are two arguments in favor of 
that. The one is a functional argument: As a result of the 
successful coalition with the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], we have made a coalition 
statement in favor of continuing the coalition, and Mr. Kohl and 
Mr. Waigel will simply not manage on their own. This means, the 
FDP is needed for functional reasons, and it will make it clear 
with its issues in the Bundestag election campaign that it is 
needed and that it would be bad if there were no liberal force 
in the German Bundestag anymore. 
  [Correspondent] Well, the CDU/CSU is certainly not 
presumptuous enough to expect to win the absolute majority 
itself. No, it needs the FDP. Nevertheless, one probably has 
to note that what the CDU/CSU has been gaining in the polls over 
the past few weeks -- that is, what Kohl is winning -- is lost 
by Kinkel. Will you still win enough votes to enter a coalition 
on 16 October? 
  [Kinkel] We will certainly win enough votes. We will 
primarily conduct an election campaign for second votes and, of 
course, we also have to win from the others. There is no doubt 
that we must win back from the Greens the votes we have lost; 
naturally, we will also try to win votes in other fields. 
  By the way, it is not true that Kohl won votes only from our 
reservoir. I have to repeat again that I assume that the 
CDU/CSU will win the most votes in the Bundestag elections and I 
am quite confident that we will contribute so much that it will 
be enough to form a coalition again. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, it is said that you lack profile 
not only outside the party but also in the party. The entire 
party is accused of not having a liberal profile anymore. Are 
you not able to accomplish that yourself? 
  [Kinkel] I would not accept this statement. At the moment 
we are in a slump, there is no doubt about it. I repeat again 
that I do not want to whitewash anything. 
  However, today we once again analyzed our situation very 
carefully. We have worked out a new strategy. We know our 
issues. We need not change anything about that. And we will 
conduct the election campaign with issues that we believe are 
attractive to the voters. This state is excessively regulated. 
We will say that the citizens are required to pay too many 
taxes. We want to cut taxes. We want to say clearly that we 
have to restructure our social system -- not cut back social 
services but restructure our social system. Demanding 90 social 
services from 40 different institutions cannot be correct. Our 
alternative is citizen's money. And, above all, we want to 
support very strongly the medium-sized industries. 
  However, we also want to show that we were, are, and will 
remain the party of openness to the world, of tolerance, and of 
the rule-of-law state, and we do not want to become narrower. 
  [Correspondent] Let us talk about economic issues. At one 
time there was the slogan that the FDP is the party of the 
high-wage earners. You retracted this statement, but now you 
have to live with the rather strange comment that yesterday's 
election showed how many high-wage earners there are in 
Saxony-Anhalt, namely 3.7 percent. Does this not have a 
profound effect? Was this slogan incorrect and one that you 
need to get away from again? 
  [Kinkel] Well, the thing was that the stuff about high-wage 
earners was contained in a draft of our program and was not 
meant in the way it was presented by the media. However, it was 
something that was easy to misunderstand. I admitted it at the 
congress, and so did the secretary general. We said that we had 
not paid enough attention to this, and we put it right. 
  What we meant was something completely different. We meant 
that the FDP is committed to supporting those people who perform 
most in this country. Of course, they are the ones who have to 
fill the baskets in the economy, so to speak, but they are not 
the only ones. There are also those who perform in their fields 
as skilled workers, as engineers, as nurses and show 
above-average dedication, enthusiasm, readiness to take a risk, 
etc. We have committed ourselves to that and we will continue 
to do that, because without these people who are capable of high 
performance we will not be able to make progress, above all in 
our economy. 
  [Correspondent] How can you get away from the image that the 
FDP basically is just an economic party? 
  [Kinkel] Well, I believe that this image has been pinned to 
us a bit recently. However, I also admit that perhaps we did 
not draw our contours sharply enough. At the news conference 
after our Presidium and Executive Committee meetings today I 
clearly said that we have to differentiate ourselves more 
strongly, above all, from our own coalition partner. We will do 
so increasingly with a view to the forthcoming Bundestag 
election. We also have to differentiate ourselves from the 
other parties. Perhaps we have indeed not been able to do so 
sufficiently in the recent past. However, this is also a bit 
due to the fact that the two big parties have come very close 
together in ideological terms and also in some other respects so 
that our position in the middle has certainly become a bit more 
difficult and we have certain interfaces with the big parties, 
but, above all, also with the Greens. And this is our main 
opponent. We have to tackle this and we have to ensure that we 
get voters who have moved over there back to us again. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, I would like to come back to a 
previous issue again: Genscher speaks of strategic mistakes. 
Count Lambsdorff says that the party must not deteriorate to 
become an economic party. The North Rhine-Westphalian FDP tries 
to enforce a new course. And you say: Let us continue. 
  [Kinkel] No, I am not saying this. This morning we were all 
together in the Presidium and in the Executive Committee. It is 
not the case that everything is just falling out of the clouds. 
We discussed the matter openly and this is also in my interest. 
But the statements that you mentioned do not contradict each 
other. The North Rhine-Westphalian FDP does not want a 
different course, it wants us to analyze the situation carefully 
and gain enough profile to win the next elections. I can only 
agree with that. This is no problem. 
  I certainly do not have any disagreements with Count 
Lambsdorff and with Mr. Genscher. We have to try together to do 
what is possible to get out of the slump. And in this we have 
to make joint efforts for this purpose. Cheap advice is not 
enough. We must stick together and bring our party together. 
In the end we will add things up, and here I always point out 
that I myself have been a long-distance runner and that I am not 
so easily upset. 
  Of course, I also accept responsibility for the difficult 
times and difficult defeats that we are experiencing at the 
moment. You know, praise and condemnation are very close 
together in the case of a party chairman. Just think that, 
until recently, Mr. Scharping was the bearer of the nation's 
hopes. Within three weeks he has acquired such an image that I 
really pitied him. 
  As a party chairman, I know full well how quickly one is 
praised and how quickly one is condemned. 
  [Correspondent] But, Mr. Kinkel, with just an appeal that 
the party stick together you will probably not be able to 
convince the voters. 
  [Kinkel] Quite correct. 
  [Correspondent] The issue certainly is the party's strategic 
position and in this connection your party colleague Gerhard 
Rudolf Baum says: We must make sure that the enlightened 
citizenship, the liberal citizens, do not completely move over 
to the Greens. I ask you once again: How are you going to 
prevent that? 
  [Kinkel] Well, we have to stress, to stress more strongly, 
to work out more clearly that we are -- I repeat -- the party of 
tolerance, of openness to the world. After 1945, thanks to the 
FDP, this country was ruled not from the fringes but from the 
center -- with a sense of perspective and with reason. This was 
certainly to the credit of the FDP, which essentially 
contributed to the reconstruction after 1945 and also really 
deserves credit for contributing to reunification. In contrast 
to others, who constantly claim what they could do so well and 
present their visions, we showed in practical work in the 
Federal Government, in the laender, and in the communities after 
1945 that we actually can do it. 
  It would be ridiculous to assume that we have suddenly lost 
this ability. We will certainly manage to show that we have not 
before the Bundestag elections and before the next three Landtag 
elections, but I say once again: It is easier to criticize than 
to make things better. 
  Quite clearly, we have not managed to persuade the voters 
that we are a party that is needed, a party that one must vote 
for to ensure that it is in the parliaments because it is simply 
indispensable. I believe it would be an enormous loss if the 
FDP were to disappear from the German Bundestag. It will not. 
You know that every time the death knell has been sounded for 
us, the situation was usually very favorable for us. 
  [Correspondent] Please, tell us how you want to achieve 
that. Belief is not an issue for such a television program, nor 
is it an issue for politics. How do you want to show your 
profile over the next four months? 
  [Kinkel] Well, first of all: We are needed for functional 
reasons. We will oppose a grand coalition and a red-green 
coalition. This will be our functional element. And Mr. Kohl 
and Mr. Waigel say that they need the FDP and that they want to 
continue the coalition with us. This is the first thing. 
  Then we have the issues. We will have to stress those issues 
with which we believe we can win voters. There are 10 or 11 
issues, which we set down today again. I can give you a brief 
overview. 
  [Correspondent] The most important ones, please. 
  [Kinkel] Taxes: We say the solidarity surcharge must be 
reconsidered after three years with the goal of abolishing it. 
  [Correspondent] This is already known. 
  [Kinkel] This is one issue. We also have other issues 
related to taxes. I will leave them out now. 
  We say this state is excessively legislated, excessively 
interlaced, excessively bureaucratized. We must reduce all that. 
  [Correspondent] The justice minister is from the FDP. 
  [Kinkel] Well, the justice minister is not solely 
responsible in this regard. 
  [Correspondent] Quite correct, there are a few others who 
are also responsible. 
  [Kinkel] Third, we say that we are suffocating because of 
our social system, as I said before. 
  We say the medium-sized industries are the engine of our 
economy and must be strengthened, above all in the new laender. 
  We say we need tax preferences -- value-added tax 
preferences 
for the new laender so the products that are produced there can 
be sold at more favorable prices. 
  We say we are the party of tolerance; we make sure that 
minorities are not discriminated against in this country. We 
make sure that foreigners can feel comfortable in this country. 
  Above all, we are also the party of foreign and European 
policy. It was Foreign Ministers Scheel and Genscher and, in all 
modesty, also Kinkel for more than two years, who have worked 
particularly hard for Europe and have shaped this country's 
foreign policy practically during the entire postwar period. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Kinkel, there are also critics in your 
party, who say that, if you want to be successful, you must get 
away from cozying up to the CDU/CSU, away from cozying up to 
Kohl. Is this something that you also see in this way? 
  [Kinkel] We have a coalition with the CDU/CSU. Here it is 
very difficult to follow a course that, on the one hand, 
implements the coalition issues, the material issues and, on the 
other hand, permits some kind of different profile, as some 
people want. I am accused of cozying up to the chancellor. I 
have said again and again: Ask him how accommodating he finds 
me. I am far less accommodating than most people. Of course, I 
have to show my own profile, and I will do this. 
  [Correspondent] But the public does not notice it. In which 
field do you dare to enter into a conflict with the chancellor? 
  [Kinkel] Well, I have dared to enter into conflicts with the 
chancellor in many fields. Just think of the last conflict, a 
massive conflict, that I dared to enter with him, which was the 
conflict over constitutional issues. 
  This week we will have a big constitutional debate, 
regarding 
which we have said very clearly that we will not be bound by the 
coalition discipline and will introduce minority rights as a 
regulation for the Basic Law, that we will, above all, also 
support forms of living together that differ from the family. 
We have stated clearly that we want to include the objective of 
reunification in the preamble. Thus, we will differ very 
greatly. This is, for instance, an issue where we will differ. 
  Or take citizenship, dual citizenship, a naturalization 
control law -- all these are issues where I differ very much 
with the chancellor, where you may not perhaps [words indistinct] 
  [Reporter, interrupting] ...where you have not enforced your 
views, however. 
  [Kinkel] Well, we have 11 percent in the German Bundestag. 
Mr. Kohl, together with Mr. Waigel, has a few percent more. I 
can only say: Give us a bit more power and we will enforce our 
views. 
  [Correspondent] You could have done it with the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] -- dual citizenship, for instance. 
  [Kinkel] Well, that is not the point. The point is that we 
have done successful work with the CDU/CSU since reunification 
and we want to continue it. Therefore, I need not think about 
the SPD at the moment, about what I can do together with it. 
Instead, I am thinking about how I can manage to bring about 
this coalition again and how we can tackle those issues that we 
have not yet managed to solve.

  [Text] Saarbruecken (DDP/ADN) -- Following the state 
parliament elections in Saxony-Anhalt, SPD [Social Democratic 
Party] leader Rudolf Scharping feels his party is on the way up 
again. The "very, very good result" would "spur on" the SPD, 
Scharping told Saarland Radio today. 
  The Bundestag election in October was now completely open. 
The motto of the SPD federal party conference in Halle, "Now 
we're off," had proved to be well-founded. The CDU/FDP 
[Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party] government 
coalition in Saxony-Anhalt, on the other hand, had suffered a 
"disastrous setback" with losses of almost 15 percent. If this 
trend were to continue there would be "an exciting 16 October 
[date of Bundestag election] and quite certainly a change of 
government in Germany too," the SPD's candidate for the 
chancellorship said. 
  Scharping ruled out altogether a coalition between the SPD 
and PDS [Party of Democratic Socilists] after the Bundestag 
election. His party did not want to enter into debate about 
other possible coalitions. In the second half of August at the 
latest, Scharping said he would announce how an SPD-led 
government would look.

  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] After the disaster of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in the European and local 
elections, are you still seriously dealing with Rudolf Scharping 
or are you already thinking about his successor for the 1998 
elections? 
  [Fischer] There is no reason to be resigned. Kohl must go. 
If we analyze the situation soberly, we must say: Kohl does not 
have a majority any more.... 
  [DIE WOCHE] He is just in the process of getting it back. 
  [Fischer] I do not see this at all. His Achilles heel is 
Kinkel. The Christian Democratic Union [CDU] will need every 
vote, and the risk is high that it will lose the votes that it 
lends to Kinkel in a grand coalition in the end. The Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] is in a fine state, now that a 
professional civil servant has finally taken over this party of 
free thinkers and independent people. The party is being guided 
out of the chancellor's back pocket. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Should the SPD have taken Johannes Rau out of 
the presidential elections after the second ballot for the 
benefit of Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher to give a signal for a change in 
power? 
  [Fischer] The presidential election was the strategic point, 
because the question of power was at issue. If the SPD had done 
that, it would not be Mr. Scharping who has a problem now, but 
Mr. Kohl or Mr. Kinkel, and probably the two gentlemen together. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Why is the SPD now giving in so much? 
  [Fischer] The policy of the undeclared grand coalition, of 
the maximum approach to Kohl, the policy of keeping the question 
of a change in power open, meaning the question of "How do I 
want to oust Kohl," is basically wrong. The statement that we 
want to become the strongest party has a charm that is similar 
to an announcement of the opening of a restaurant: Here you can 
get something to eat. They have neglected to tell the people 
most emphatically that it will be a misfortune if this coalition 
remains in power. I believe Gerhard Schroeder is right in this 
respect: Red-green would have a mobilizing and exacerbating 
effect. 
  [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping would probably lose credibility if 
he were to be changed into a red-green candidate. 
  [Fischer] I do not think so. I am sure: If red-green gets 
a majority in the elections, Scharping will do that. 
  [DIE WOCHE] But Scharping has announced that he wants to 
fight the election campaign against the Greens. 
  [Fischer] Oh, I am looking forward to that. I would be very 
happy if he finally were to fight the election campaign against 
someone. If he does not dare to do it against Kohl, then at 
least against us! 
  [DIE WOCHE] How would you react to that? With an election 
campaign against the SPD? 
  [Fischer] We are fighting the election campaign against 
Kohl. After 11 years of Helmut Kohl we have the highest number 
of unemployed, the highest state debts, the highest number of 
bankruptcies, the highest number of social welfare recipients, 
the greatest lack of housing, and the highest crime rate since 
the founding of the republic. In addition, there is the 
completely botched unification -- do you want to hear any more 
reasons why we are conducting the election campaign against Kohl 
and not against Scharping? Kohl must go, because he will ruin 
the country's future! 
  [DIE WOCHE] But you must help the SPD to get onto its horse. 
  [Fischer] Only those who are not afraid of being quartered 
can drag the emperor off the horse, the late Chairman Mao said. 
I am not interested in how someone gets onto the horse but only 
that the other one is taken off it. Our constitution then pulls 
up the next one automatically. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Your friend Tom Koenigs said that he does not 
understand at all what the SPD wants. Do you understand? 
  [Fischer] I see what it wants. But it cannot get into the 
chancellor's office through the back door. If one wants to get 
in, one must get in through the front door with the election 
campaign crowbar and with the toughest possible opposition. The 
challenger has not been able to make it clear that Kohl is a man 
of the 1980's and that he cannot lead this republic in the 
1990's any more. After the climax of his career, German 
unification, he has failed disastrously. Kohl's team is 
completely exhausted. Compared with this coalition, the Gobi 
desert is a green, flourishing landscape. Around Kohl you only 
find a couple of parched camels. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What is your model for Germany going to be like? 
  [Fischer] I do not want a model for Germany. I hated model 
building as a child. The battle will not be fought for models, 
it will be decided by the mood. Models bore people. The 
decisive thing is the desire for change. The challenger must 
create this mood for a new start; otherwise Kohl will stay until 
the principle of collapse has an effect, and this is very 
dangerous. Even if Kohl still rules from the Kyffhaeuser [a 
mountain where it is said sleeps Emperor Barbarossa, who will 
wake up one day and restore the German empire], he will never be 
Barbarossa for me, or Bismarck, or Adenauer, but he will always 
remain Kohl. If he is reelected, this republic will be very 
angry with itself four weeks after the Bundestag elections. 
Just as the British were after Major's reelection. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Would Gerhard Schroeder have been a better 
challenger? 
  [Fischer] I do not interfere with the SPD's personnel 
issues. 
  [DIE WOCHE] We would not have thought that you are so 
discreet. 
  [Fischer] I permit myself to note one thing: I find what 
the almost-candidate is publicly doing to the candidate in bad 
taste. 
  [DIE WOCHE] If the SPD is not able to pull itself up by its 
boot straps and grand coalitions are concluded all over the 
country, the Greens would have to think seriously about 
black-green [CDU-Greens] alliances. 
  [Fischer] Let me first say something about the traffic-light 
[SPD-FDP-Greens] coalition: May God spare us that! 
  [DIE WOCHE] That would be a completely unstable alliance. 
  [Fischer] Certainly, this would be a great problem with the 
current FDP. But perhaps Count Lambsdorff is still going to 
turn from Saul into Paul in terms of ecology. 
  [DIE WOCHE] You are quoted as saying that a red-green 
alliance would need a majority of 30 seats. 
  [Fischer] Oh, yes, yes.... 
  [DIE WOCHE] How many more mandates would a stable 
traffic-light coalition have to have? 
  [Fischer] The problem would not be so much the number of 
mandates but whether there would be more than just formulaic 
compromises. 
  [DIE WOCHE] And what about black-green? 
  [Fischer] There is no point in evading the subject: The CDU 
and we are simply too far apart in terms of contents. However, 
if the CDU were to undergo a development, leading to more 
agreement on basic issues, this debate would certainly gain 
momentum one day. As long as this is not the case, it would be 
suicidal for both sides. Any kind of adventurism would be 
punished by our voters. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Is it not time to test black-green in a city for 
a change? 
  [Fischer] Take Frankfurt. You could say: With a CDU in a 
large city -- why not? But when I look for this city CDU, I 
find the group chairman, who is accurately an old Franconian, 
and a CDU of the past. What should I do with that? Subject to 
the punishment of our party's extinction, we must stick to one 
basic rule: We are conducting an ecological and social reform 
policy, either in the government or in the opposition. However, 
reform policy must always be the priority for us, and not 
participation in government. We must certainly not do the same 
as the FDP -- doing everything just to stay in government. 
  [DIE WOCHE] In eastern Germany the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] has grown very strong. What should one do with 
it? 
  [Fischer] The PDS is eastern Germany's answer to Helmut 
Kohl. I am the last one to be filled with sympathetic feelings 
for the PDS. I still think it was a historical mistake that the 
party did not break with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany 
[SED]. Therefore, the toughest possible conflict exists in this 
respect. However, I have never understood why the achievements 
of the SED reformers are not recognized just like those of the 
other reformers in the former East Bloc. I do not want to know 
how many elections Mr. Gorbachev rigged. Nor do I want to know 
how many elections Mr. Yeltsin rigged -- I suppose, as CPSU 
district secretary he rigged quite a few. I have never 
understood why Gyula Horn gets the Charlemagne Prize while Mr. 
Modrow is put on trial, why Mr. Gorbachev was virtually declared 
an honorary citizen of the FRG while Mr. Modrow has been 
declared a pariah. The Gysis, the Modrows, and also the Wolfs 
in the security apparatus were part of the peaceful change in 
1989, which was brought about by the citizens' movements with 
great courage. 
  [DIE WOCHE] What does this mean for the PDS's ability to be 
part of a coalition? 
  [Fischer] Compared with the chutzpah of the CDU and the FDP 
to take in the former bloc parties and, at the same time, beat 
the successors of the SED, the SPD and we, too, are restrained. 
Kohl would not have any false fears of getting into contact. 
In the long run, one will not be able to ignore the fact that 
the PDS will have to prove its worth in holding responsibility 
in eastern Germany. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Reportedly, you want to become some kind of 
superminister for industry, transportation, and science after 
the elections. 
  [Fischer] Nonsense. I only say that you will not find me in 
Mr. Toepfer's doll house. 
  [DIE WOCHE] It is surprising that your liking for red-green 
has survived in Hesse. 
  [Fischer] It has! Just look at our joint political 
achievements: nuclear policy, groundwater protection, drugs 
policy, housing construction, foreigners, etc. I am often angry 
about the SPD, its secret ways, its fear of the conservatives, 
its shying away from the question of power. But there is a hell 
of a lot that we can do together. If you ask me about my 
experiences in Hesse, I am emphatically in favor of red-green.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gerd Brueggemann: "Greenspan in a Fix"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. dollar has had problems for weeks. The 
exchange rate of the U.S. currency is on a constant downward 
slide, which has brought it to so far unknown low levels 
compared with the Japanese yen and has made it fall to less than 
1.6 German marks on occasion. 
  However, this weakening was no coincidence but was certainly 
intended. The White House -- annoyed by Tokyo's unwillingness 
to make efforts to reduce its gigantic trade surplus -- tried to 
put pressure on the Japanese by strengthening the yen. 
  However, this policy, whose usefulness one might dispute 
anyway, had unexpected side effects. It undermined the trust of 
the international money managers in the United States and made 
them get rid of their dollar investments on a wide scale. This 
made long-term interest rates in the United States rise. 
  Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had 
hoped to be able to avoid this development by raising interest 
rates on short notice. However, this calculation did not work. 
The investors are obviously missing a clear commitment by the 
U.S. Administration to its own currency. So far, it has not 
been made. 
  This puts Chairman Greenspan in a dilemma. If he continues 
to raise short-term interests, as the markets demand, there is 
the danger that he will strangle the incipient recovery. If he 
leaves them unchanged, investors will continue to unload their 
dollars.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "J.J.": "Dollar Turbulence"] </F>
  [Text] Less than two weeks before the world economic 
summit in Naples, it looks as if, unexpectedly, the 
international monetary situation could move into the foreground 
again. The year 1994 has not become the year of the dollar, as 
many had expected. On the contrary -- the dollar rate is 
dropping surprisingly steeply. It is true that central banks 
have intervened, but this has apparently not solved the problem. 
Nervousness and uncertainty continue to dominate the markets, 
as our reports have shown. There are many explanations for the 
weakness of the dollar -- speculative assumptions and quite 
acceptable considerations on interest rate implications, 
cyclical developments, investment behavior, the problem of 
derivatives, and growing distrust of the U.S. Administration and 
its policy. All this is not funny, as U.S. President Bill 
Clinton says in a relaxed way, especially not for the Americans, 
whose exchange rate stability depends on the capital influx. 
Fundamental data and political intentions are one thing, 
expectations and reactions on financial markets, another. 
Whether the central banks will get this development under 
control remains to be seen. For the time being, there is 
intense speculation on a possible U.S. key interest rate 
increase. Any attempt to make policy against the markets now 
would be disastrous.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Helmut Maier-Mannhart: "Inconsistencies </F>
Surrounding the Greenback"] 
  [Text] The most striking economic paradox these days is 
that, while the American economy is at a real high, the dollar 
rate has dropped in a way that is usually only characteristic of 
the approach of a heavy storm. Moreover, in the past few weeks 
U.S. interest rates increased strongly, which generally favors a 
country's currency. Yet neither this nor a concerted action by 
the central banks could stop the downward trend of the greenback. 
  If one tries to find reasonably plausible reasons for it one 
will meet with the somewhat dubious role of the American 
Government. Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, 
has just emphasized that Washington was not at all interested in 
a falling dollar rate. Yet, in the recent past there were also 
differing statements that could not or would not blur the 
impression that a lower dollar rate could very well be used as a 
weapon in the trade war with the Japanese, who obstinately 
refuse to comply with the American desire for a reduction of 
their enormous export surplus. Regardless of how much Washington 
may deny all this, it shows how important confidence in a 
country's constant monetary policy is and to what extent the 
loss of such confidence will affect the foreign currency markets. 
  One critical point regarding the economic figures of the 
leading economic power is its chronic deficit in the balance of 
goods and services, which will climb to $140 billion this year 
-- with trends pointing even further upwards. The rising 
economy has created a virtual boom for imports, which is having 
an increasingly negative effect on the trade balance and, 
consequently also the balance of goods and services. The result 
is that the trading partners are piling up dollars, which 
increase the dollar offer when exchanged into the individual 
national currencies. The role of speculation is unclear, even 
though one can assume that it supports the trend. 
  If people on the other side of the Atlantic are now toying 
with the idea of stabilizing the exchange rate through 
increasing interest rates, one can only warn them. The only 
effect would be an increase in the price of money in Europe, 
too. Yet, for economic reasons this is absolutely not wanted. 
Only a confidence-building economic and monetary policy in 
Washington will, in the long term, lead to exchange rates that 
are guided by purchasing power. Until then, one will have to 
live with the unstable situation at the foreign currency markets 
and their negative impact on the financial markets.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Joffe: "The Rediscovery of Europe"] </F>
  [Text] The fact that a U.S. ambassador leaves Bonn after 
only eight months would normally only be a surprising and not 
overwhelming piece of news. In this case, however, it means a 
new chapter of U.S. foreign policy under the working title: 
Europe is "in" again. 
  Richard Holbrooke is not just leaving, he is climbing up the 
ladder -- to lead the European section in the Department of 
State, an institution which was powerful in the past but has 
recently been almost forgotten, and will now be clearly 
revitalized with Holbrooke. He is not a reserve player in 
Clinton's team, but a major player -- with a good network of 
relations within the administration and the party. 
  The Washington seismographs have already registered another 
underground event. Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for 
Europe in the National Security Council and was hardly doing a 
better job than former head of the European section Stephen 
Oxman, was fired in an elegant way. She will become ambassador 
to Prague. Her successor in the White House will be a 
heavyweight. 
  Incidentally, a Washington think tank, the Economic Strategy 
Institute, has just published a report that reverses the 
traditional truth: The future of the United States is not in 
Asia, but in "old," "weary," "sclerotic" (these are the usual 
adjectives) Europe. How come -- since it has been preached for 
years that the fate of the United States will be decided in the 
high-growth Asian region, amidst the "little tigers" and "large 
dragons?" 
  Titled "Europe and the U.S. Economy -- the Most Important of 
All Bilateral Relations," the study presents the following 
account: Trade with Japan and China accounts for 70 percent of 
the U.S. deficit, whereas the United States reaches a surplus in 
trade with Europe. The United States exports raw materials to 
the Far East and imports high-tech products from there; with 
Europe, it is the other way round. Regarding direct investment, 
Europe and the United States are mutually the largest investors, 
whereas Japan continues to block U.S. investment. The political 
upshot is this: "It is the Europeans who share the U.S. notions 
on the future of the world economic order most;" one should not 
"mistake individual conflicts for conflicts on principles." 
  Did Secretary of State Warren Christopher not complain about 
the fact last year that there was "a lot of criticism" from 
Europe, but not from Asia, and that Western Europe was no longer 
"the dominant region in the world"? The three visits to Europe 
of Bill Clinton (in January, June, and July) speak a different 
language, and the reasons for the "promotion" of Europe are 
obvious. 
  First, enthusiasm for the Pacific region is ebbing away. 
China -- with its human rights and Korean policy -- has proved 
to be a difficult partner, which is demonstrating its big power 
awareness too often through opposition to Washington. Japan 
remains a stubborn trading partner who is trying to ward off all 
attacks against its market fortress in the jujitsu style, but is 
also unable to give itself a stable, functioning government. 
Nor has the United States forgotten those "Asiatic values" that 
Singapore mentioned to justify the humiliating whipping of a 
U.S. youth. 
  Second, Europe is not as boring or as stable as had been 
assumed after the end of the 40-Years War -- the Cold War. 
Italy, once the most reliable ally, has become a question mark 
following the election of Berlusconi and the neofascists. 
France and Britain are both suffering from progressive 
leadership weakness -- each country in its own way. The same 
holds true for Spain. In Bosnia, every cease-fire has proved to 
be a treacherous interruption, during which the three warring 
parties establish new potentials and positions for the next 
phase. On the other side of the Elbe river, Washington sees 
former communists regain strength, while Russia -- no matter how 
strong or weak it is -- continues to be a problem for Europe. 
  Briefly, foreign policy, which was apparently tamed after 
the 
end of the Cold War, has got its clutches on Bill Clinton again. 
It could even cost him his reelection in two years -- what with 
Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, where Clinton has not really 
shown brilliant leadership. Then the electorate will not deal 
with Clinton's scandals and love affairs any more, but will ask 
how he turned the superpower's talents that the United States 
inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to good 
account. 
  That is why a reshuffle has begun in the present half-time 
-- 
primarily on the classical European parquet, which seems to be 
much more slippery than it was one or two years ago. However, 
this will not be enough. On the upper floors, too -- regarding 
Security Adviser Lake and State Secretary Christopher -- there 
is growing unrest. Anyway, there is increasing speculation on 
their possible successors. The Europeans should welcome the new 
respect for the "old continent" and the reshuffle in Washington 
because a confusing, unsteady, and sometimes even blase foreign 
policy "Made in U.S.A." has never been an advantage for Europe. 
However, it is not the underlings who are responsible for 
foreign policy but their chief. He can only be exchanged by the 
U.S. voters.
