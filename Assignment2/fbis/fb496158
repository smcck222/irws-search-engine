Important Route to Raising Women's Status in Society: Interview 
with State Statistical Bureau, Social Department director Wu Jun 
(0702 6511)"] 
  [Text] In September 1995, the United Nations Fourth World 
Women's Congress will be held at Beijing -- the largest 
international conference to take place in China since the birth 
of the People's Republic. At that time, 15,000 representatives 
of United Nations member states will gather in Beijing to 
discuss issues of women in the world. One-half of the human race 
being female, issues of women are relevant to the development of 
human kind. Not long ago, this reporter called on State 
Statistical Bureau's Social Department director Ms. Wu Jun, who 
is a member of the propaganda subcommittee of the China 
Organizing Committee for the 4th World Women's Congress. 
  [Reporter] In July 1985, the 3rd World Women's Congress held 
in Nairobi, Kenya, adopted the "Nairobi Forward Strategy for 
Raising the Status of Women by the Year 2000." May I ask what is 
the current status of women in China? 
  [Wu] At present, with respect to employment of women in 
China, it can be said that the number of women employed is 
rising rapidly, but their status within the occupational 
structure is improving slowly; that basic education is rapidly 
reaching more women, but the rate of women graduating from 
higher education is slow; that traditional concepts still to a 
considerable degree hamper development of women's self esteem 
and competitiveness; and that discrimination in the society 
against women still exists and women do not enjoy equal 
educational and employment opportunities. 
  [Reporter] What are the results of China's effort to raise 
the status of women? 
  [Wu] China is one of the countries that endorsed the 
"Nairobi 
Strategy." The Chinese government has historically emphasized 
the importance of raising the social status of women. In the 
current waves of reform and opening, women in China are marching 
smartly forward in the society, and this can be seen in terms of 
the following: 
  First, the number of women employed is increasing rapidly. 
Reform and opening have created a favorable societal environment 
for women to play their role. In 1990, of the total 647,240,000 
persons employed in China, 291,010,000 were females, an increase 
of 27.7 percent over the 1982 figure. In this same time period, 
the number of males employed increased by 21.3 percent. In 1990, 
the number of females employed constituted 44.96 percent of the 
total employed population, an increase of 1.27 percentage points 
over 1982. 
  Second, channels of employment for women are widening. In 
the 
last few years, women's employment in the various trades and 
occupations has shown considerable changes. The number of 
females employed in financial and insurance trades has increased 
1.6-fold, commercial food service and supply trades 79.6 
percent, offices and organizations 78.6 percent, and public 
health and welfare trades 42.7 percent. Other than 
transportation, telecommunications, construction and real estate 
services, where increases in the number of males employed are 
greater, in all other trades and occupations, the rate of 
increase of females employed is faster than males. In health and 
welfare occupations, the rate of increase in employment of 
females is much greater than males. 
  Third, the cultural background of women been raised, while 
their status within the occupational structure continues to 
improve. In 1990, the number of women with junior high, high 
school and college education increased 56.98 percent, 37.6 
percent and 2.08-fold respectively over comparable figures in 
1982. The fact that women's cultural and educational level is 
rising has contributed to improved employment status of women. 
  [Reporter] What do you consider to be the most pressing 
issues for women in China today? 
  [Wu] There are several: Women still have more difficulties 
seeking employment and, for college-educated women, obtaining 
work assignments matched to their training; in terms of 
improving their status within the occupational structure, women 
still tend to hold lower grade jobs; in rural areas, women face 
greater difficulties moving into other non-agricultural fields; 
and in the work force, a relatively higher proportion of females 
employed are of the younger age groups. 
  In education of women, both their numbers and rate of 
enrollment in school are low among females of school age in 
rural areas; overall, among the employed, the higher that 
educational or technical background required in certain 
occupations, the lower the proportion of women represented 
therein. 
  [Reporter] To realize the "Nairobi Strategy" stated goal 
that 
"for women to participate in development, there must be 
realistic assurances that women and men can participate equally 
in formulating plans for national economical and social 
development, and take part concretely in developmental 
activities," what further steps should China undertake to help 
implement this goal? 
  [Wu] To begin with, first we should further intensify reform 
and liberate and develop our productive capacity. Only through 
deepening reform, continually liberating and developing our 
productive capacity, raising the automation, technological and 
knowledge levels in our work while lessening the degree of 
direct reliance on man's physical labor in the production 
process, can we further widen the channels of employment for 
women. We must at the same time vigorously develop the tertiary 
industries. 
  Second, we need to raise the levels of socialization, 
mechanization and automation in household chores and labor. 
  Third, we should vigorously develop education. With respect 
to education for females, we should strive for a unified 
approach to making basic education available to all women as 
well as raising the educational level of all women. In 1990, 
close to one-third of the females age 15 and over were 
illiterate or semi-literate; while only 2.3 percent of women in 
ages 20-24 had a college education. Therefore, on the one hand, 
we should concentrate on eliminating illiteracy among women, at 
the same time, we must also emphasize promoting higher education 
for women. 
  Fourth, we should ensure that in the process of developing 
the socialist spirit and culture, concrete efforts are made to 
promoting respect for women and supporting and protecting 
benefits for women through widespread propaganda and creating an 
atmosphere conducive to realistically carrying out our tasks.

"China's Labor Export on Contractual Basis Develops Rapidly"] 
  [Text] China's system to sign contracts to provide labor 
service for construction projects abroad and cooperate with 
foreign countries in the field of labor service is developed 
under the guidance of the reform and opening-up program after 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. 
Right now, it is of a fair-sized scale on the foreign labor 
market, and it has attained remarkable economic results. 
  Between 1979 and 1993, China signed 45,257 contracts with 
foreign countries to provide labor service for construction 
projects abroad. The total contract value reached US$32 billion 
and the total volume of business valued at US$19.6 billion. More 
than 740,000 laborers were sent out to foreign countries to help 
develop various projects. The total contract value, the total 
volume of business and the total number of laborers sent abroad 
during this period rose an average 46 percent, 36 percent and 16 
percent respectively each year. Especially in 1992 and 1993, 
China's contract business for labor service abroad progressed 
rapidly. 
  China's contract business for labor service abroad almost 
covers the whole world. Right now, it has extended to 169 
countries and regions. Asia is the world's largest market for 
contracted labor to foreign countries at present. It is also 
China's largest market for such labor service during the past 
several years. In 1993, China signed a total of 7,310 new labor 
service contracts with 35 Asian countries and regions with a 
total contract value of US$4.144 billion, and provided labor 
services valued at US$2.81 billion. Africa was one of the 
regions where China started its contract labor services abroad 
earliest. In 1993, China signed 607 new labor service contracts 
with 49 African nations with a total contract value of $702 
million and provided labor services valued at $618 million. The 
number of Chinese laborers and personnel in Africa reached 
19,400 at the end of 1993. Europe, especially Russia, is where 
China's contract labor service abroad had developed most rapidly 
in recent years. In 1993, China signed 918 new labor service 
contracts with 32 European nations with a total contract value 
of $715 million and provided labor services valued at $331 
million. The number of Chinese laborers and personnel in Europe 
reached 20,800 at the end of 1993. In 1993, China signed 373 new 
labor service contracts with 30 American nations with a total 
contract value of $160 million and provided labor services 
valued at $150 million. The number of Chinese laborers and 
personnel in Africa reached 9,036 at the end of 1993. 
  As of now, 312 enterprises in China have been authorized by 
the state to provide labor service abroad on a contractual 
basis. Some of them are of a comprehensive nature, while others 
are of a professional nature. In addition, there are more than 
70 scientific research institutes which carry out designing and 
consultation work. These enterprises and research institutes 
form an enterprise group which helps China compete with foreign 
contractors in all trades and dimensions on the world labor 
market. After their continuous developments, many enterprises 
such as the China Construction Engineering Corporation, the 
China Harbor Engineering Corporation, the China Metallurgical 
Corporation, the China Hydraulic Engineering Corporation and the 
China Road and Bridge Engineering Corporation have joined the 
ranks of the 250 largest contractors in the world. The total 
value of the overseas contracts signed by these five 
corporations reached $1.8 billion in 1992, accounting for 1.23 
percent of the total value of all 1992 international contracts 
signed in the world and 20.3 percent of the total overseas 
contract value of the contracting companies in developing 
countries. These five corporations had notably raised their 
capabilities in providing labor service abroad for large foreign 
construction projects. 
  There were 16 companies in 1991, 16 companies in 1992 and 20 
companies in 1993 in China, whose annual labor service contract 
value abroad exceeded $100 million. Meanwhile this amount is on 
the increase at all times. In 1993, the total contract value of 
these 20 companies reached $4.05 billion, accounting for 59.6 
percent of the contract value of all the labor service contracts 
signed in that year. In addition, some small new companies such 
as the "Beijing Construction Company", the "Aquatic Production 
Company", the "Oceangoing", the "Eastern", the "Black 
Engineering," and the "Good Fortune Labor Service" are catching 
up and overtaking the old-timers. They had done an excellent 
business in 1993. There were 15 small companies in 1992 and 25 
small companies in 1993, whose volume of business exceeded $50 
million each year. In 1993, the volume of business of these 25 
companies reached $3.398 billion, and they accomplished 74.4 
percent of their annual goal in business. In addition, China has 
also expanded its services for designing, planning and 
consultation on the world market, and increased its capability 
in contracting and cooperating with foreign countries for labor 
service abroad. According to incomplete statistics, enterprises 
including the "Chengda Chemical Engineering", the "Coal Mining 
Designing Company" and the "Aviation Planning Company" signed 
new designing contracts with foreign countries in 1993. Their 
total contracts valued at $47.87 million in 1993. 
  China's cooperation with foreign countries in the field of 
labor service not only helps strengthen its friendship with the 
people in other countries and develop economic and trading 
relations with other nations, but also creates new opportunities 
for employment, introduce into China the mechanism for 
competition, promotes foreign trade, earns more foreign exchange 
by exporting equipment and materials, and helps the development 
of other related trades such as the civil aviation, banking, 
insurance, transportation, communications, posts and 
telecommunications. Between the beginning of 1979 and the end of 
1992, China's contracts to provide labor service abroad had 
helped exporting equipment made in China and materials with a 
total value of $1.3 billion. In addition, the state had 
authorized, in the past two years, a total of 70 international 
labor service contracting companies to import some commercial 
products. The total value of the exported goods of these 
companies also exceeded $1.4 billion. These companies have 
attained gratifying results in taking the path of "promoting 
diversified operations while giving priority to their main line 
of business."

  [Summary] The planned cotton area in Liaoning Province 
this year is 1 million mu, as of the middle of March only 
800,000 mu had been planted. Farmers do not want to plant 
cotton because profits from grain and cash crops are higher. 
Cotton degeneration is severe, thus it is difficult to raise 
quality and output. There is a shortage of funds to support 
cotton planting, which affects farmer enthusiasm to plant cotton.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Jianwei (1728 0256 0251): "Law Enforcement </F>
Organs Abuse Office for Profits"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] After lying dormant during the 
drive to improve the economic climate and rectify the economic 
order, the economy rebounded before long and bold reform slogans 
replaced the debate over whether one should call something 
"socialist" or "capitalist." Unfortunately a number of law 
enforcement organs, responding to the slogan of "overhauling our 
thinking, changing our ideas, and serving economic construction" 
but misinterpreting the policy, behave in a way that departs 
from the law in doing their job, as epitomized currently by 
their abuse of power to profit themselves illegally. 
  First of all, they confiscate, collect fees, and impose 
fines 
arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their power to manage traffic, 
public security organs set up checkpoints, stop traffic, impose 
fines, and confiscate as they please. As managers of the 
permanent residency registration system, they arbitrarily demand 
payments, all clearly marked on a price list, from peasants who 
want to switch from agriculture to a non-agricultural sector and 
from people who want to transfer their residency registration 
from one locality to another. As keepers of law and order, they 
arbitrarily confiscate and impose fines higher than the maximum 
amounts allowed under the regulations. As investigators of 
crime, they arbitrarily collect fees and impose fines, 
masquerading them as "deposits," and replace prison sentences 
with fines or confiscation, even demanding a "case-solving" fee 
from the victim or defendant. As managers of prisons and 
detention centers, they demand from suspects and defendants in 
custody as well as convicted criminals money to cover meals and 
collect from them a "management fee." Relatives of convicted 
criminals who come to visit are told to pay a "visitation 
management fee." Abusing their power to investigate some cases, 
to approve and rule on arrests, and to file charges, 
procuratorial organs substitute a fine for a prison sentence and 
collect "deposits," "exemption from lawsuit fees," "exemption 
from lawsuit study fees," and "exemption from lawsuit bang jiao 
fees" arbitrarily. Taking advantage of their judicial power, 
judicial organs collect "sentence suspension fees," "sentence 
suspension study fees," and "sentence suspension bang jiao fees" 
arbitrarily. Judicial administrative organs in prisons and 
reform-through-labor facilities even go so far as to allow 
criminals in custody who have already been sentenced to go out 
to engage in commercial activities and take a cut of the 
latter's profits. 
  Second, acting ultra vires or sidestepping the law, some law 
enforcement organs meddle in economic disputes by collecting 
fees or demanding debt repayment on behalf of an enterprise. In 
the name of "serving economic construction," "protecting an 
enterprise," and bolding searching for a new way to serve 
economic construction, public security organs and procuratorial 
organs marshall the human and material resources of their own 
units to help enterprises with their debt or payment collection 
efforts in return for some form of compensation known variously 
as "service fee," "labor fee," "sponsorship fee," and 
"deduction." Deviating from the judicial principle of not 
accepting or hearing a case unless charges have been filed, 
judicial organs collect bad debts on behalf of enterprises 
through extra-judicial channels. All these activities differ 
from recovering stolen goods for the victim in a criminal case. 
They also differ from ruling in or adjudicating civil cases and 
economic cases in accordance with mandatory civil rules or 
enforcing mediation agreements. 
  Third, they engage in all manner of revenue-generating 
activities. Abusing their power, for instance, law enforcement 
organs collect fees, levy taxes, and impose fines on behalf of 
other departments in return for appropriate compensation. A few 
law enforcement organs even use police cars as taxis to make a 
profit. 
  These days a widely held view among law enforcement workers 
in the field is that since law-enforcement organs are seriously 
under-funded when it comes to processing cases, the practices of 
fining a criminal instead of imposing a prison term and 
demanding sums from defendants and victims can only strengthen 
those organs economically and therefore make them better able to 
handle cases. Fining a defendant, it is also argued, serves the 
purpose of punishing him. Regarding the practice of collecting 
debts on behalf of an enterprise, some law-enforcement personnel 
claim that as a method of solving an economic dispute, the civil 
lawsuit takes too long. Even if a person wins a case, the 
verdict is often difficult to enforce. Enterprises turn to 
law-enforcement organs for help, it is said, because they are 
leery of getting trapped in litigation. When a law enforcement 
organ, overstepping its authority or sidestepping the law, 
succeeds in collecting a debt promptly, it provides production 
with a powerful safeguard. On the one hand, it wins praise for 
"protecting an enterprise." On the other hand, it obtains a 
tangible benefit that would enable it to add new equipment or 
modernize existing equipment and improve its financial position. 
It is a case of killing two birds with one stone. What is wrong 
with that, they ask? 
  To my mind, the above argument is long on trivia but short 
on 
major principles. To argue thus is to see the part while 
overlooking the whole. These people are only concerned about the 
preservation and aggrandizement of departmental interests while 
ignoring the preservation of the general interest. Work guided 
by such thinking will inevitably damage the reputation of state 
organs and encourage the spread of corruption. 
  First of all, law enforcement organs which abused their 
office to profit themselves illegally constituted a blot on 
China's political history. 
  There were two major chronic ills in China's political 
history. One was autocratic politics, which had its origins in 
the Qin Dynasty. Calling himself the First Emperor, its founder 
thought he embodied the moral virtues of the Three Emperors and 
considered his achievements greater than those of the Five 
Emperors. He unified the whole country and made China his 
personal possession. Although the dynasty he founded did not 
pass from one generation to the next endlessly, contrary to what 
he had hoped, the autocratic system he put in place lasted with 
no interruption to become a terminal disease in our feudal 
history. The other was bureaucratic politics. It too had an 
impressive list of symptoms. Economically, bureaucratic politics 
manifested itself as abusing one's power to profit oneself. One 
way to do this was to create a state-run economy. Another was to 
extort excessive taxes and levies by virtue of one's power. 
[passage omitted] 
  Third, when law enforcement organs abuse their authority to 
enrich themselves illegally, they in effect connive at criminal 
conduct and hurt legal construction. 
  Lax law enforcement is an outstanding problem these days. 
One 
of its causes is the phenomenon of law enforcement organs making 
money illegally. Consider : 1) Public security organs demand a 
"case solving fee" from victims. Only after they are paid would 
they agree to return the stolen goods or economic damages. Since 
victims are made to suffer two times over, they often balk at 
reporting a crime. The result is a serious crime under-reporting 
problem. 2) The practice of demanding a fine instead of imposing 
a prison term has given rise to a de facto system of bribing 
one's way out of jail. In handling some cases, law enforcement 
organs take the mediation route. After paying the victim a 
specified sum, they make him drop the charges regardless of the 
interest of the state in prosecuting the case. The upshot is a 
new way of handling cases in which a criminal who pays a fine 
will not be physically punished or can buy his way out of 
prison. Criminals get off easily. 3) In collecting debts, law 
enforcement organs content themselves with the recovery of 
properties. Even when they discover criminal activities, they 
ask no questions, let alone handing over the case promptly to 
the agency with the proper jurisdiction so that the latter can 
investigate it in accordance with the law. Consequently, 
criminals escape scot-free and remain beyond the reach of the 
law. This deals a heavy blow to the authority and dignity of the 
law, in addition to preventing the elimination of adverse 
factors in the economic climate, which in turn militates against 
healthy economic development. 4) When a law enforcement organ 
devotes a substantial portion of its human and material 
resources to collecting debts and other sums, normal 
case-solving is affected, resulting in half-hearted law 
enforcement. Without exception all these circumstances are a 
byproduct of law enforcement organs trying to line their pockets 
illegally. At a time when the market economy needs the 
protection of the law, they disrupt the legal system and 
undermine the concept of the rule of law. The danger is obvious. 
  Fourth, it is corruption itself for law enforcement organs 
to 
profit themselves illegally by abusing their power. In so doing 
they seriously damage the image of law enforcement organs in the 
public eye. 
  When law enforcement organs abuse their office and collect 
fines and fees arbitrarily under all sorts of pretexts, they are 
behaving in a way that runs counter to the honesty and 
incorruptibility long advocated by our party. This situation has 
aroused the concern of people of insight as well as the anger of 
the masses and severely damaged the image of law enforcement 
organs in the public mind. When law enforcement organs demand 
case-solving fees from victims or meddle in economic affairs 
with hopes of taking a cut, when they help enterprises or 
individuals collect unpaid debts, they are in effect behaving 
like for-hire social service organizations such as 
private-investigation companies or debt-collection outfits, 
projecting an image far from appropriate for law enforcement 
organs. Once state organs preoccupy themselves with 
money-making, they lose the incorruptibility indispensable to 
operating impartially. Practice also proves that the inevitable 
result of such conduct is more and more people bending the law 
for personal gains. 
  In collecting unpaid debts, moreover, some law enforcement 
organs misuse their coercive state power to, for instance, take 
a person into custody. This practice seriously tarnishes the 
reputation of state organs.

Courts Bring Their Judicial Function To Full Play: Attack Crime, 
Protect Public, Safeguard Stability"] 
  [Text] Urumqi's courts at both levels gave full play to 
their judicial function to preserve social stability and protect 
the people's and the legal persons' legal rights. Last year, 
they tried and concluded 19,074 assorted court cases, 16.43 
percent more than in the previous year. 
  Urumqi's courts at both levels tried and sentenced 1,499 
criminal elements who had committed murder, rape, hooliganism 
and robbery, or deliberate assault and other serious crimes. 
They also held prompt and open public trials, proving that they 
were serious about their assault on crime. They also launched a 
series of special crackdowns and tried and wrapped up 578 crime 
cases involving theft, drug trafficking, and trademark 
counterfeiting. 
  As the case load increased and difficult cases multiplied, 
the entire judicial and cadre and police contingent dealing with 
civil cases further speeded up the handling of real estate, 
debt, and labor dispute cases, properly dealt with marriage and 
family and inheritance cases, and promptly resolved disputes and 
settled conflicts to further promote stability, unity, and the 
socialist spiritual civilization.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Ruping (0491 2485 1627): "The Storm To Clean </F>
Up Government Will Not Blow Over Soon"] 
  [Text] The storm to clean up the government has been 
sweeping the nation since August 1993. From the perspective of 
the People's Congress deputies and the Political Consultative 
Conference members who are taking an active part or a 
consultative role in government, what picture does this storm 
paint? 
  No doubt, in this storm the anti-corruption campaign has 
produced outstanding results. Based on detailed data provided by 
Mijiti Kuerban, People's Congress deputy and Xinjiang's chief 
procurator, show that In 1993, the region handled 2,161 
corruption and bribery and other economic crime cases; 933 cases 
were filed and investigated and 621 cases were tried and closed. 
The largest corruption case involved 1.89 million yuan and the 
largest bribery case involved 215,000 yuan. Thirty county- and 
section-level cadres were tried as criminals. 
  This storm has shaken up the land north and south of 
Tianshan. In the meetings of the People's Congress and the 
Political Consultative Conference, anti-corruption and 
advocation of honest government is still a hot topic. At those 
meetings, we hear a lot of "jingles." What these jingles 
describe are not accurate summations; in many ways they may even 
be biased. But they nevertheless express what the people have in 
mind. They prove that corruption has not been swept away by the 
storm; the "hotbeds" that breed corruption have not been 
thoroughly sterilized; party-mass relations and cadre-mass 
relations need to be further reinforced and strengthened. We 
must not over-estimate the initial success of the 
anti-corruption campaign, nor should we under-estimate the 
dangers of corruption. 
  According to People's Congress Deputy Matao Haiguoen, most 
prefectures and counties in the autonomous region are in 
financial red ink and are unable to come up with the money to 
fund education and health care and other undertakings, but they 
have the money to buy expensive cars and build fancy public 
buildings; some towns and townships are copying them. Some 
township government officials do not want 212 jeeps; they prefer 
luxury cars which do not even run well on bumpy country roads. 
They just want to show off. 
  People's Congress Deputy Muheiti Manlike said frankly that 
today, leading cadres get new cars more often, and they get more 
expensive cars every year; they move every time a new house is 
built, but meanwhile some enterprises can't even pay wages, and 
the masses are very upset. The cadres' work-style must change 
radically; otherwise the gulf between the leadership and the 
masses will only widen. 
  Rampant unhealthy tendencies make it difficult for honesty 
to 
plant a foothold. Without righteousness and honesty, corruption 
will inevitably run amuck. This is the philosophy lesson society 
has taught us as it develops. 
  Abusing power for private gains, using money to buy power 
and 
using power to make money, money-worshipping, and hedonism are 
like "smelly tofu"--they smell bad to others but taste good to 
those who are enjoying them, and that is why these phenomena are 
hanging around like ghostly spirits. After this big 
anti-corruption storm, members of the People's Congress and the 
Political Consultative Conference will pay even more attention 
to creating an honest government. 
  What is the crux of the problem? 
  Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party 
Committee 
spoke up before the Political Consultative Conference that the 
key to whether we can staunchly continue the anti-corruption and 
honest government campaign will depend on the Communist Party 
which is the ruling party. If the party members can discipline 
themselves and stay clean and honest, then the party's work 
style will be upright, and the anti-corruption and clean 
government campaign within the party will be a victory, and 
there will be hope for the nation's anti-corruption struggle. 
Jiusan Society's Xinjiang Party Committee even came up with 
three 14-article suggestions on fighting corruption. 
  The deputies and conference members also reached the 
consensus that in attacking corruption and building an honest 
government, it is important to cure the symptom and the causes 
at the same time. We must link attacking crime, punishing 
corruption, and constructing a hard-working and clean government 
together. 
  "It is not enough to rely on education alone to ensure 
honesty in government. We must have a healthy system of rules 
and regulations and legal measures to constrain and regulate 
behavior," said An Qingming [1344 1987 2494], People's Congress 
deputy. 
  Members of the Political Consultative Conference advised 
that 
we must do something so that, one, the masses of public 
employees do not want to be corrupt (we can provide proper 
spiritual and material civilizations conditions); two, they must 
not be corrupt (we must amplify the legal system and 
supervision); three, they dare not be corrupt (we must impose 
harsh punishment and publicly expose them.) 
  The People's Congress and the Political Consultative 
Conference meetings happen to coincide with Secretary General 
Jiang Zemin's important speech against corruption before the 
Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee's Central 
Advisory Commission. The deputies and the committee members are 
greatly encouraged, but at the same time, they also realize that 
anti-corruption is not a war that can be won in a single battle; 
rather, we must take one step at a time and do a thorough job 
and push forward in stages. But no matter what, the 
anti-corruption and honest government campaign will not be a 
perfunctory gesture, as feared by some deputies and committee 
members. This storm will not blow over soon.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "South </F>
Xinjiang Regional Deputies Agree: Stability Is the Prerequisite 
for Economic Development"] 
  [Text] In the last few days, minority nationality People's 
Congress deputies from the four south Xinjiang prefectures and 
autonomous prefectures have been engaging in a heated debate on 
stability and on promoting development. The deputies believe 
that if Xinjiang is to have a stable social-political 
environment, we must first stabilize and increase input in south 
Xinjiang. 
  Deputy Julaiti Maimaitiming said, Hotan Prefecture is an 
exceptionally poor prefecture; the national separatist elements' 
subversive activities are a problem. Relying on our own hard 
work and struggle alone--without the state and the autonomous 
region's special political and financial support--it will be 
impossible for the prefecture to accelerate development or to 
become relatively well-off at the same time as the rest of 
Xinjiang. Deputy Yibulayinmu Sulaiman said, agricultural input 
in south Xinjiang should be greatly increased, because south 
Xinjiang's development is dependent primarily on agriculture, 
and if this problem is not properly resolved, we can't even 
begin to talk about becoming well-off, and it will adversely 
affect stability. He also said that if south Xinjiang wants to 
keep its talented people, the government must formulate special 
policies to keep those people and create an environment that 
respects knowledge and talents. Delegate Hadir Kayitoufu said, 
some of south Xinjiang's prefectures, autonomous prefectures, 
and counties are economically backward; the peasants carry a 
heavy burden and cannot afford to send their children to school. 
He suggested that while the government vigorously develop the 
economy, it should reduce the minority nationality students' 
school expenses in some regions to support educational 
development. He also said that we should continue to vigorously 
implement the "Law on Regional Autonomy of Minority 
Nationalities" and assign minority nationality and Chinese 
students on an equal basis, because it will help promote 
stability. 
  Deputy Zhu Ruojing [8540 5387 7234] said, stability is the 
prerequisite for reform and development. Without a stable 
political environment and without unity among the nationalities, 
there will be no economic development and prosperity for south 
Xinjiang. Deputy Maimaitiming Tuoheti said, it is imperative 
that we truly understand that the threat to Xinjiang comes 
mainly from national separatism and that we must crack down on 
the separatist conspiracies within the region and strengthen the 
political and legal contingents. Delegate Qi Baowen [7871 0202 
2429], who represent the military police, said that they 
shoulder the important responsibility of protecting the 
fatherland's unity, opposing national separatism, and preserving 
social stability. He said that the unity between the Army and 
the people must be strengthened, that we need to acquire a 
stronger sense of national defense, and we must resolutely and 
steadfastly struggle against a handful of minority nationality 
separatists and other hostile forces and make a positive 
contribution toward protecting social stability and promoting 
economic development.

  [Text] Abulaidi Amudurexiti and Amudun Niyaz, Xinjiang 
Autonomous Region leaders, give high regards to a letter sent by 
peasants from the village of Bohetaikeli in Shufu county to 
resolve the matter of a lack of rural peasant funds to repair 
rural roads during this people's congress session. 
  The village of Bohetaikeli in Shufu county has been known 
far 
and wide since 1952 when Chairman Mao responded to a letter from 
its peasants. In January 1994 General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
wrote another letter in reply to the peasants there. Abulaidi 
Amudurexiti and Amudun Niyaz made a special trip to the village 
to read out General Secretary Zemin 's response, making the 
village a focal hot spot. In recent years, endless streams of 
people have gone there to visit, travel, or do business. To 
accelerate the economic growth of the entire village, in 1993 
the peasants there collected funds to repair a rural road which 
requires a total of 680,000 yuan. Beyond the 400,000 yuan which 
the peasants collected, another 280,000 yuan is needed. During 
this people's congress, Abulaidi Amudurexiti will take the 
village peasants' reply letter to the communications office of 
the autonomous region for the chairman. After the leadership of 
the office studies it and comes to a decision, it will disburse 
to the village 280,000 yuan to help the peasants repair the road 
as soon as possible.

  [Text] "The time has come to take overall charge of public 
security. The matter must be put on the agenda and energetically 
handled." This was a forceful call to the people's 
representatives attending the second plenary session of the 
eighth autonomous region people's congress. 
  In 15 years of reform and an open door policy, the issue of 
public security is increasingly prominent. Our region has gone 
from being closed to open. The economy has developed 
considerably. At the same time, some bad things have taken the 
opportunity to come in. Moreover, in recent years personnel from 
elsewhere have flooded into our region. In 1993 throughout the 
region there were more than 11,000 crimes tried, a relatively 
great increase over 1992. In Urumqi criminal activity was even 
more serious; the number of criminal cases tried was up 27 
percent. Representative Xie Jianxun [6200 1696 8113] said that 
when society was closed we used static public security. Now that 
people, money and things are in great circulation, we use 
dynamic public security. Now, motives for committing crimes are 
complex: blind pandering, seeking high levels of enjoyment, 
undisclosed remuneration of profit distribution to heads of 
enterprises, etc.; leading to cases of graft, robbery, 
explosives, and beatings. In mentioning criminal cases, 
circulating people must be mentioned. They account for more than 
30 percent of the crime rate in Urumqi and 70 percent of those 
harmed are personnel in circulation at the southern railway 
station. Representatives He Bingxian [0149 4426 6343] and Zhang 
Xuewen [1728 1331 2429] are deeply empathetic. Many thefts and 
robberies are committed by personnel circulating independently. 
Before the spring festival in particular, they steal chickens 
and seize dogs everywhere, stealing whatever they can, robbing 
whatever comes along, "bagging things to take home and pass the 
new year." 
  It is noteworthy that the age of criminal elements is ever 
younger now. Youths account for 80 percent of crime. Many 
representatives believe that this is related to our greater 
social environment. In schools there is little moral training 
but lopsided seeking of high grades and advancing grades. Some 
periodicals, movies, and television propagate violence and sex. 
These factors enticing many young people to take the path of 
crime cannot be overlooked. 
  Representative Xie Jianxun said that ineffective attacks on 
criminal elements and low solved case rates are current problems 
we cannot dodge. Yet the serious difficulties of weak police 
forces, lack of funds and backward equipment affect the speed 
and quality with which law enforcement departments try cases. 
Our entire bureau has a total of more than 3,500 people. Overall 
quality is insufficiently high. Only one-third of the personnel 
has undergone systematic training. Communications equipment is 
far from up to date. In one instance our cadres and police 
caught a fleeing criminal. The jeep had only gone several 
hundred meters when it died and they watched the criminal run 
away. It now costs more than 10,000 yuan to catch a criminal but 
our annual costs only pay wages to support common office work. 
  Law enforcement sectors' prime job is to face the flashpoint 
issues in public security, adopt effective measures and curb 
rising crime. Representative Chen Jinchi [7115 6855 3069] 
believes public security organizations must further implement a 
"serious attack" policy: quickly and doubly attack various 
criminal elements. Enhance overall control of public security, 
issue control measures with all social forces, augment 
watchguard work, establish various watchguard measures and 
systems suited to developing a socialist market economy. 
Additionally, we must enhance public security work, improve the 
quality of cadres and police, perfect grass roots security and 
control systems and street offices, allowing grassroots 
organizations to play fully the important role of maintaining 
public security. He also called on society to show more concern 
and support for the work of public security troops.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "More and More People Want Independence"] </F>
  [Text] A Gallup poll on the question of independence for 
Taiwan, published yesterday, revealed that after the 
"Ch'ien-tao-hu Incident," 27 percent of all ROC residents favor 
independence for Taiwan. This indicates that the people's 
inclination toward an independent Taiwan has been growing year 
by year, while the proportion of those opposed to independence, 
for the first time, fell below the 50 percent mark to 45.5 
percent. Analyzed by backgrounds, the poll shows that support 
for independence is extremely strong in the southern part of 
Taiwan, namely 36.7 percent, while those opposing independence 
are in an inferior position of only 36.4 percent. This was the 
first time in public opinion polls on Taiwan that supporters of 
Taiwan independence outscored those in opposition to 
independence. 
  The results of this public opinion poll possibly show the 
direction of present public opinion on Taiwan. However, since 
25.4 percent of the population indicated that they would not 
say, had no opinion, or did not know; and because public opinion 
polls are inherently hardly ever 100 percent indicative of the 
true opinions of people when questioned on such a subject as the 
independence of Taiwan, there may be a margin of error. We may 
therefore only say that there is a trend of increasing support 
for Taiwan independence, and that this value --the hopes of the 
population of Taiwan to become an independent sovereign 
state--is increasing year by year. 
  The people questioned in the said poll of course were also 
influenced by the "Ch'ien-tao-hu Incident" and by the 
dictatorial way the Chinese Communist authorities handled the 
case. However, a more weighty factor must be attributed to the 
fact that people on Taiwan, after the lifting of martial law, 
have pondered the gains in the unification-independence argument 
in view of the international standing of Taiwan and the future 
prospects of the country. It all boils down to three big factors 
here: The diplomatic predicament Taiwan finds itself in has the 
people most fervently wish that the status of the country be 
made evident as such in the international community. The way 
relations between the two sides of the strait have developed, 
the people of Taiwan recognize more accurately the disparity in 
their political-economic systems and in social and cultural 
respects, and wishes for reunification of China have dampened. 
Finally, it is also most important to note the progress in 
democratization and pluralism on Taiwan which has greatly raised 
their consciousness of self-rule, as manifested in that their 
ideas on state and nation tend of course toward becoming a 
dignified and respected state and nation by themselves, which, 
in turn, engenders the idea of being one life community by 
themselves. 
  We are not surprised by the growing tendency for 
independence 
among the Taiwanese population, as revealed in the Gallup poll; 
it is a natural result of the democratization of the country. 
However, this kind of a public opinion trend deserves to be 
faced squarely by all political parties and political regimes. 
It is precisely as President Lee Teng-hui once emphasized: The 
sovereignty of a country rests with its people, and the position 
and development of the state must also be adjusted according to 
the direction of public opinion. The most important factor that 
will have an impact on Taiwan's future will, we are afraid, not 
be any one-way consideration of unification or independence, but 
rather, finally, the independent choice of the 11 million 
people. We hope the government and the public will combine all 
their common wisdom, will then gradually readjust the present 
state policy for unification, and will set their minds on a less 
disputed developmental road for the state.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Are Taiwan Products Losing Out in the U.S. </F>
Market?"] 
  [Text] The Committee on Mainland Affairs recently published 
data which show that the share of Taiwan products in the U.S. 
market has successively declined over the last six years, from 
5.62 to 4.35 percent, while the share of mainland products has 
steadily gone up, from 1.93 to 5.47 percent. The reporting 
member of the said committee sees this as the sign that Taiwan 
products are now in inferior position in the competitive battle 
for overseas markets between the industries on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. He attributes this situation to the fact that 
Taiwan merchants have shifted their production bases and have 
placed large investments on the mainland. 
  There is no doubt that the success of mainland products and 
failure of Taiwan products on the U.S. market is closely related 
to the fact that Taiwan merchants have placed investments on the 
mainland, but it is still open to argument whether this 
indicates that Taiwan products are "in inferior position" and 
are "successively declining." If we carefully examine the 
changes in the trade situation since 1986 as between Taiwan, the 
United States, and other East Asian countries, we may discover 
that while other countries and territories have greatly 
increased their exports to the United States and Taiwan's rate 
of export increases to the United States has slackened, the 
value of Taiwan's exports to the various countries of East Asia 
has greatly increased. For instance, Malaysia's exports to the 
United States increased from about $2.3 billion in 1986 to $5.8 
billion in 1991, while Taiwan's exports to Malaysia also 
increased from 200 million to $1.5 billion. Thailand's exports 
to the United States increased from about $1.6 billion in 1986 
to $6.1 billion in 1991, however, Taiwan's exports to Thailand 
increased from $300 million to $1.4 billion. This indicates that 
as Taiwan merchants placed their investments in Malaysia, 
Thailand, and in Mainland China, the effect was not at all that 
products formerly exported to the United States were merely 
diverted to exports to the said regions, but rather that these 
regions greatly increased purchases of Taiwan raw materials and 
machinery for use in their processing industries. 
  From the viewpoint of upgrading industry, this situation is 
normal and healthy. The said "upgrading of industry" consists in 
reducing the traditional production of labor-intensive products 
and shifting to the production of capital- and 
technology-intensive products. Those industries which Taiwan 
merchants moved to the mainland or Southeast Asia were mostly 
labor-intensive industries, which had been gradually losing 
their competitive strength on Taiwan. On the other hand, 
overseas industries initiated by Taiwan merchants were 
purchasing Taiwan products, which were mostly capital- and 
technology-intensive semifinished products and machinery. This 
conforms to the directional shift in the comparative advantage 
caused by the change of comparative prices of key elements of 
production, as it also conforms to Taiwan's objective of 
economic upgrading. 
  In actual fact, it is not only Taiwan that is undergoing 
this 
kind of a shift, but similar shifts are taking place in South 
Korea, which is at a similar stage of development as Taiwan, and 
then even in the more advanced country of Japan. Since 1986, 
South Korea's share in the U.S. market has declined, but at the 
same time South Korea's investments in Southeast Asia and South 
Korea's exports to Malaysia have increased from about $200 
million in 1986 to $1.1 billion in 1991, and exports to Thailand 
during the same period from $200 million to $1.4 billion. Japan 
is at a much higher stage of development than Taiwan and South 
Korea, but Japan too is to a certain extent conducting similar 
operations; between 1986 and 1991 exports from Japan have 
increased: to Malaysia from 1.7 billion to $7.6 billion, and to 
Thailand from $2.0 billion to $9.4 billion. 
  Japanese economists have come up with a "wild goose flight" 
theory of economic development [one goose following the other] 
to describe this phenomenon. Whenever economic entities of East 
Asia, which are all at different stages of development, face 
other economies in the world which are in a simultaneous process 
of economic advance, the relative scarcity of key elements of 
production and the gradual transfer of comparative advantages, 
makes the situation, with its transfers each time from the first 
economic entity to the hands of the next contestant, appear like 
a relay race, and in this process investments and trade produce 
corresponding changes. 
  This does not, of course, signify that nothing is left in 
the 
hands of the economic entity that is in the relatively more 
advanced position, but it indicates that it will, in addition to 
increased investments and exports to the developmentally lower 
area, produce new products that conform to its particular 
comparative advantage. As far as Taiwan is concerned, its 
electronic communications industry is rapidly developing; its 
computer main frames and monitors have been at the top in world 
markets for several consecutive years. Exports of these two 
items have increased from $2.3 billion in 1990 to $4 billion 
last year, which gives a good picture of the situation. 
  Going abroad with their investments by Taiwan merchants has 
of course also its negative effects, and problems involved in 
investments on the mainland must be noted, must be taken into 
consideration, and must be studied. However, if one looks purely 
at the change of their shares in the U.S. market, and would 
conclude that Taiwan products are in an inferior position and 
that industrial upgrading has not been successful, it would 
unavoidably be too rough and careless a conclusion. The effect 
of the increase in value of the NT$ [new Taiwan dollar] since 
1986 and the effect of Taiwan merchants going abroad with their 
investments must be understood within the framework of the 
changes in relations between the economic entities through the 
entire East Asia region, and the true situation can only be 
understood when studying the development indicated by the "wild 
goose flight" theory. This alone will furnish the foundation for 
a rational and feasible policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Ho Li (0149 4539): "Democrats Scrambling To Get </F>
on `Last Train'"] 
  [Text] The big boss in the north has said time and again 
that Hong Kong's three-tier legislature will be reelected. There 
will be no "direct" transition, and no legislative member should 
expect to ride the "through train" [meaning that members of Hong 
Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon confirmation by 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Preparatory 
Committee, members of the first Legislative Council of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region]. This is because the British 
Hong Kong authorities have submitted the so-called "three 
violations" political reform package [Chris Patten's plan in 
violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong 
Basic Law, and the understandings reached between China and 
Britain] to the Legislative Council, and the Sino-British talks 
have broken down. Now, whatever political reform plan is adopted 
by the Legislative Council, a new kitchen will have to be set up 
in 1997, says the big boss. 
  The 1994/95 elections for the three-tier legislature are 
drawing near. Though this "last train," with a life of only two 
or three years, cannot carry the passengers to their 
destination, all political parties and organizations and all 
politicians, big and small, are scrambling to get on board. They 
include not only democrats and conservatives but also pro-China 
political organizations. This is not because they turn a deaf 
ear to the northern big boss' "stern" statement. Rather, the 
reason is that if you do not get on the train, the arena will be 
occupied by others in the next two to three years. 
  With the curtain to be raised soon for the election war, a 
must now in political circles is to deal with friends and foes 
with diplomacy. If some results can be produced eventually 
through negotiations, the outcome would be the confrontation of 
two big forces. The democrats would team up to encounter the 
"Unsacred Alliance" formed by the conservative and pro-China 
forces. 
  The hardliners among the democrats are most likely to be 
pushed down from the train in 1997. Their participation in 
political affairs is more or less out of a 
going-without-retreating mentality. This is especially true for 
their attitude toward the "last train" before 1997. You must 
first get on the train before you are pushed down from the train. 
  In the 1994/95 three-tier legislature election, all are 
ready 
to do their utmost no matter what plan the Legislative Council 
will adopt. Election of the local legislature--district 
boards--will be held in this September. Next year the Hong 
Kong-Kowloon and New Territories urban councils will be elected. 
This will be followed by the most influential event--the 
election of the Legislative Council. Election of the district 
boards and urban councils are skirmishes for the Legislative 
Council election. In this year's district board election, there 
will be 360 seats to be filled. The "Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong," a pro-China political organization, 
has revealed that it will support 80 candidates to run for these 
seats. The "Liberal Party," which is regarded as a conservative 
party, has announced that it will have some 100 members to join 
the election war. As to the three democratic political 
organizations, it is estimated that the "United Democrats of 
Hong Kong" will have 100 candidates, the "Meeting Point" some 30 
candidates, and the "Association for Democracy and People's 
Livelihood" about 40 to 50 candidates. 
  Whether the democrats can team up in the election depends on 
whether agreement can be reached through negotiations among the 
United Democrats of Hong Kong, the Meeting Point, and the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. In principle, 
the agreement will be that, in the same election district, the 
three organizations will make all-out efforts to support only 
one democratic candidate who is most likely to win the election. 
This will avert their contention in the same election district. 
Even if contention occurs in the same district, they hope to 
minimize it and behave as true gentlemen, if at all possible, so 
as to avoid hurting their amity. 
  As a matter of fact, the district boards have 360 seats, 
while the three democratic organizations have less than 200 
candidates in total. Perhaps the democrats should pay more 
attention to studying the cause that has limited their 
development and resulted in their insufficient manpower. 
Meanwhile, because of the three organizations' overlapping areas 
of development, their candidates may conflict with one another 
in the same election district. In the past, these three 
organizations have all along tried to negotiate with one 
another. In the 1991 district board election, however, they did 
have some conflicts despite their negotiation efforts. In 1991, 
the United Democrats of Hong Kong supported 71 candidates to run 
for the district board seats, the Association of Democracy and 
People's Livelihood had 17 candidates, and the Meeting Point had 
13. In that election, conflicts did occur between the 
Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting 
Point. 
  Nonetheless, whether the three democratic organizations can 
reach some agreement through negotiations cannot be judged 
merely by the existence or nonexistence of conflicts among them 
in the district board election. We must look into other factors. 
  A flagship among the democrats, the United Democrats of Hong 
Kong is the largest of the three democratic political 
organizations, presently taking up 13 seats in the Legislative 
Council (including as many as 11 of the 18 directly elected 
seats). It, therefore, has the posture of a "big party." In the 
eyes of the northern big boss, however, the United Democrats of 
Hong Kong is a thorn in his side and must be taken out. The 
United Democrats of Hong Kong has expressed willingness to hold 
dialogues with the Chinese side, but the latter has viewed it as 
a "group not to maintain contacts with" and has consistently 
hurled accusations against it. 
  As for the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood 
and the Meeting Point, the former was previously more 
enthusiastic about participation in political affairs than the 
latter. This is because at the inception the Meeting Point was 
mainly a political-critic group. Now, however, in the 
Legislative Council the Meeting Point holds four seats, while 
the Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is merely a 
"one-person party." Toward these two political organizations, 
the Chinese side's attitude is different from that toward the 
United Democrats of Hong Kong. The Chinese side has said that 
dialogues can be held with them and, what is more, it will 
appoint their members as Hong Kong affairs advisors and district 
affairs advisors. Toward the Chinese side's gesture, the Meeting 
Point takes a relatively clear attitude. It agrees to have 
dialogues with the Chinese side, but upholds its own stand. With 
regard to the issue of Hong Kong's political reform, it supports 
democracy and takes Governor Chris Patten's package as the 
bottom line. On the other hand, the political stand of the 
Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood is 
comparatively "ambiguous." 
  The United Democrats of Hong Kong and the Meeting Point have 
shown a stronger desire to seek coordination among the 
democrats. The Meeting Point has said openly that it is willing 
to consult with the United Democrats of Hong Kong and the 
Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood so that they 
can coordinate with and support one another in this year's 
district board election. In contrast, as people within the 
political circles may recall, in the 1991 election, when the 
Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood and the Meeting 
Point both planned to nominate their candidates for the same 
election district, the former proposed two solutions: One, the 
opponent should make way. Two, the two organizations should 
merge into one. 
  In fact, teaming up among democrats should not be limited to 
coordination in the district board election. A higher goal 
should be the development of a broader united front consisting 
of the three organizations plus other democratic personages. 
This is particularly necessary in view of the Legislative 
Council election to be held next year. The Legislative Council 
has 60 seats, of which 20 will be directly elected (of the other 
seats, 30 will be elected by functional constituencies, and 10 
by the Election Committee). This makes it all the more necessary 
for the democrats to coordinate their actions with respect to 
candidates for the various election districts. They should pool 
their efforts and support one another. However, teaming up may 
be just wishful thinking. Turning it into a reality will 
probably involve grave difficulties. One of the difficulties 
is the hard-to-resolve conflicts of interests among the 
democratic political organizations. Every political organization 
wants to expand their strength and influence. The most effective 
way to do this is to gain more seats in the legislature, 
especially the Legislative Council. Since this concerns their 
interests, it would be hard to be "modest." In the past 
elections, though the three democratic organizations sought to 
coordinate their actions, none would make way for the others. 
Election is a seat-seizing game. As there are only a limited 
number of seats on the "last train," a scramble for seats will 
easily occur. 
  Further, attention should be paid to the splittism caused by 
the "China factor." The northern big boss has always wanted to 
suppress the United Democrats of Hong Kong by smearing that 
organization so hard as if it had contracted "political AIDS" 
and everyone should keep apart from it. Long ago Beijing began 
to behave as the ruler of Hong Kong. It seems that the United 
Democrats of Hong Kong can only have a gloomy political future. 
Under China's big-stick policy, the United Democrats of Hong 
Kong, though it may become a passenger on the "last train," is 
most likely to be pushed down. And, in all probability, other 
political organizations and politicians, big and small, will 
keep a "safe distance" from it and will have reservations about 
coordinating with it or allying with it to form a democratic 
united front, if they think of their "own prosperous future" or 
if they are frightened by the stick of the northern big boss. 
Now, the northern big boss is keeping a fierce watch on the 
democrats' efforts toward coordination. China's mouthpiece has 
already launched an offensive, asserting that the United 
Democrats of Hong Kong is "overbearing" and cannot coordinate 
with the other democrats. At the same time, the Chinese side has 
spread words to the effect that the newly appointed Hong Kong 
affairs advisors and district affairs advisors will include 
members of the Meeting Point and the Association of Democracy 
and People's Livelihood, but no consideration will be given to 
members of the United Democrats of Hong Kong. This is to display 
its traditional talisman--the carrot in addition to the stick.

"Li Chu-ming (2621 2691 6900) Discusses Writing the Political 
Program of the `Democratic Party'--It Will Clarify Policy on 
China Questions"] 
  [Text] After the merger of the Hong Kong Alliance and 
Meeting Point into one new party, the "Democratic Party," there 
will be a change in policy, and the formerly vague China policy 
will be clarified and rendered specific. Li Chu-ming, chairman 
of Hong Kong Alliance, described it as an excellent change to 
accommodate the new developments in the overall situation. 
Writing the political program of the new party is an opportunity 
that will allow incorporating some of Meeting Point's ideas on 
China. 
  When the Hong Kong Alliance was founded in 1990, it resented 
being mixed up by outsiders with the "Chih Lian Hui," and it 
therefore described itself in contradistinction as a local 
political organization based on Hong Kong, closely interested in 
every policy of the Chinese Government that concerns Hong Kong, 
but "without any intention of involving itself in the politics 
of Chinese territory outside of Hong Kong." In observance of 
this principle, the Hong Kong Alliance has all along declined to 
involve itself in China's internal affairs, and it has, indeed 
for this reason, been criticized by outsiders that it lacked a 
China policy and lacked discernment in matters Chinese. 
  On the other hand, Meeting Point had decided already at the 
time of its founding in 1983 on a set of "New Three People's 
Principles," i.e. on a "return to democracy" standpoint. In its 
political program it clearly outlined as the role of the people 
of Hong Kong "to contribute to the development of China," and it 
supported in a variety of forms and through solid contacts the 
progressive forces inside and outside the system. As to its 
China policy, it emphasized in even stronger terms adoption of a 
"critical relationship." 
  In the 10 prominent paragraphs of the manifesto on the 
organization of the new party, there is one paragraph that 
asserts that the people of Hong Kong are a part of the Chinese 
people "with the right and responsibility to participate in and 
deliberate on national affairs." This reflects a quite different 
attitude on the China question than that of the Hong Kong 
Alliance. 
  Yesterday, Li Chu-ming expressed to this reporter that 
writing the political program of the new party will provide an 
opportunity to further elucidate and concretely stipulate the 
attitude toward China. He pointed out that the closer we get to 
1979, the more reason there is for the people of Hong Kong to 
concern themselves with the affairs of China, and it is also 
clearly written in the constitution of the PRC that the Chinese 
people have the right and duty to do just that. 
  He said, in the past the attitude of the Hong Kong Alliance 
had been that the people of Hong Kong should not concern 
themselves with policies and measures that had only to do with 
China's internal affairs, and that they should not comment on 
such. However, from now on there will be a change in that they 
should make their position clear on particular events whenever 
necessary. He believes "it is a good thing to clarify policy 
`toward China.'" 
  The two parties appointed 16 delegates to form a combined 
preparatory committee to implement the merger and may later set 
up another team with the particular responsibility to write the 
political program of the new party. Li Chu-ming indicated that 
the Hong Kong Alliance will of course incorporate some points of 
the Meeting Point's political program. He said: "Wherever the 
Hong Kong Alliance lacks competent people and specialized 
knowledge, things from Meeting Point will be taken over." 
  On the question of policy toward the Chinese Government, he 
declared: "We shall certainly approve of everything good, and 
everything that is not, we shall oppose." The Hong Kong Alliance 
has shifted from avoiding involvement in internal affairs to 
actively facing problems of that nature, and is displaying 
precisely the attitude of a "critical relationship" that Meeting 
Point had advocated all along. Meeting Point's political program 
contained its standpoint on six eminent problems in China-Hong 
Kong relations, namely: the state's nationality principle, 
consideration of legal principles, the 4 June incident, the role 
of the people of Hong Kong, participation in national affairs, 
and the "critical relationship." As far as the Hong Kong 
Alliance is concerned, it did not display concrete principles, 
but merely emphasized the principle of "promoting mutual 
relations between China and Hong Kong outside of the political 
area." What changes there will be in the political program of 
the new party will certainly deserve our close attention.

  [Text] Summary 
  China's economic system reform has entered its 16th year. 
Reform before that can be divided roughly into two stages. In 
the first stage (1978-1991), reform was launched in a sequence 
from countryside to city, from allocation to production, from 
enterprise operation rights to ownership rights, from adjusting 
prices to relaxing them, and from a consumption market to a 
capital market, having chosen gradual advancement as the way of 
reform. This suits China's practical situation, and especially 
suits its system and developmental background. The successes 
attained in the primary stage of reform have provided the 
impetus for the whole economic system to take an important step 
towards shifting to the socialist market economic system. 
  Although the first stage of reform cannot be described 
simply 
by carrying forward a single project or by an isolated force 
penetrating deeply into reform, still, a synthesized set of 
reform supports was not really launched. The reform strategy 
chosen was supervision by division of rights and transmission of 
profits for steady advancement; at the outset, the ultimate goal 
for changing the whole system was unclear, so reform could be 
done only through taking each step cautiously, "fording the 
river while touching each stone at the river bottom," which 
definitely limited to some degree its width, depth and progress. 
  After Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech during his southern 
China trip in 1992, and the 14th CPC Conference's positioning 
the wholesale changeover of the economic system to the 
"socialist market economy" as the overriding policy, the theory 
of reform reached a new level. Once the goals of reform were set 
out, there was motivation to shift to the new stage of economic 
reform, and the reform strategy selected shifted from gradual 
progress to acceleration, from supporting parts to a whole set 
of supports, from research and experimentation to a 
comprehensive plan. However, speeding up reform and the set of 
reforms requires further perfecting and detailed consideration 
and preparation. The reform of 1993 was conducted against just 
such a background. Viewed from the strategic level of reform, 
1993 was a year which pushed reform to accomplish a periodic 
transition, a year of theoretical conclusions and designing 
plans for the approaching complete set of reforms; meanwhile, it 
also set out some reform steps to match up with developing the 
market economy on a new level. 
  Because the new stage of reform is more strongly 
characterized by comprehensiveness and continuity, we cannot ask 
whether the reforms of one particular year were significant and 
outstanding achievements. Rather, we should base our evaluation 
on the whole entity and the long term. Especially since the 
problems which exist in the current economic operations process 
were brought on for the most part by conflicts between dual 
channel systems, unavoidable when shifting from a commodity 
economy to a market economy. Although "strengthening 
macroeconomic adjustment and control" and leading into the 
parameters for adjusting parallel systems in 1993 did not 
completely eliminate the traditional means of planned economic 
adjustment, the flexible operations of "microeconomic 
adjustment" and strengthening finances, especially banks' key 
role in macroeconomic management, have brought under control the 
basic key elements of the macroeconomic adjustment system 
linking with the market economy. Of course, it is the 
economists' responsibility and duty to confront current 
problems, analyze their outstanding causes, determine ways of 
resolving them, and propose countermeasures aimed at speeding up 
reform in the new stage, especially in 1994. It is also the 
basic starting point of this research report. 
<H5>  Reform Achievements in the Transition </H5>
  In 1993, the central government gathered various forces 
which 
drew up plans for comprehensive reform, and proposed a 
comprehensive set of reform plans, starting with the five areas 
of finance, revenue, investment, enterprises, and social 
insurance. This is a major achievement, defining the activity 
and mission of reform in the new stage under the prerequisite of 
summarizing the experience of the previous 15 years of reform. 
It is certain that since 1984, every larger scale reform had a 
plan, but these were either outlined or just promoted in a 
single item, without a comprehensive supporting set in 
accordance with the demands of the market economy. However, 
1993s plan was a substantial supporting set of reform plans 
based on marketization, which prepared for comprehensive 
creation of the system in the second stage. 
  In the timely, sequential process of reform, distribution of 
content and force of reform is not balanced and in equal value; 
some years have more reform content while some have less 
content. Usually, in years with less reform content the focus is 
often on reorganizing and handling the economic order, resolving 
outstanding new contradictions and problems, creating a better 
environment for new stages of reform. The "reorganization and 
handling" of 1989-1991 and the "macroeconomic control and 
adjustment" of July to October 1993 were both of this sort. But, 
the former was not only a comprehensive, long term shrinkage of 
the economy, forcefully implemented, it was also carried out 
through project cutbacks and termination of investment by 
administrative orders handed down from higher to lower levels, 
in an attempt to control increasing demand through a low growth 
rate, bringing about an artificial "balance between supply and 
demand". The result was that three years' reorganization and 
handling brought on a two and half year slump in the market. In 
addition, when a favorable reform environment emerged, there was 
a failure to enforce reform promptly to promote the transition 
from the first stage of reform to the second stage, and a 
wonderful reform opportunity was missed. 
  In contrast, the second shrinkage of the economy was not 
comprehensive, only about half a year, and carried less force. 
In addition, it employed parameter controls instead of the 
traditional quota controls. On the one hand, it adjusted 
people's and enterprises' monetary activities by flexible 
adjustment of the exchange rate, thereby stabilizing it, and 
guaranteeing the RMB's reputation and status; this special 
effort to unify the exchange rate provided experiences and 
lessons in currency reform which definitely will be employed in 
the future. On the other hand, although the interest rate 
adjustment tended to be small, it basically worked to control 
the expansion of investment and furthered the tendency of 
residents to make deposits, stifling their overwhelming urge to 
consume and stabilizing the market to carry out its "soft 
landing" function. Doubtless, this parameter control was 
accomplished through governmental intervention, certainly far 
from the parameter management of the developed market economy. 
But the problem is that the banks and the government are still 
not separate. "Bank independence" and "specialized bank 
commercialization" still have not moved from theory to reality, 
the central bank has not gained its independence, stable 
economic function and rights under the "bank president directed 
by senior officers" system. If government did not intervene 
directly, macroadjustment and control would have no function. In 
the transitional period from the traditional planned economy to 
the socialist market economy, from direct control to indirect 
control, we will often have the situation that the new system 
cannot work if we do not take advantage of the old system; what 
is meaningful here is that the self-reform of the old system 
will gradually provide space for breeding the new system. The 
macroadjustment and control during the summer and autumn of 1993 
is a model sample in this regard. For cooling down real estate 
market, the major goal is to restrict developing a "froth 
economy," to avoid having capital which is primarily short from 
flowing into real estate excessively and thereby increasing the 
basic industry bottlenecks, e.g., transportation, 
telecommunications, etc. In addition, most of the capital used 
on the stock exchange and real estate exchange are public funds, 
so if we do not implement controls until the new system is built 
up completely, the final explosion of accumulated contradictions 
will be hard to imagine. Meanwhile, there cannot be lasting, 
rapid, and healthy development of the economy either. 
  The operation of economic policy in 1993 can be summarized 
as 
"focusing with both hands". This means using one hand to grasp 
macrocontrol and adjustment, while suppressing an overheated 
economy, trying to avoid decline, and maintaining rapid growth. 
On the other hand grasping system renewal, while carrying out 
comprehensive reform design, accelerating domestic economic work 
and progressively regulating marketization of the system. 
Besides the reform achievements listed above, there was other 
significant progress in 1993's reform, including the following 
several areas: 
  1. The key measure of passing price reform 
  In the past 13 years, China has achieved much in the way of 
price reform. Up to 1992, in the national market set price rate, 
agricultural products and by-products occupied 78.5 percent, 
gross social commodity retail sale value occupied 79.6 percent, 
and production materials occupied 64.2 percent; as for share of 
market adjustment in national commodity value, agricultural 
products and by-products were at 77.8 percent, consumer goods at 
83.4 percent, and among these, industrial consumer goods were at 
78.1 percent, and production materials at 61.8 percent. In 1993, 
in the commodity market, those items which had been viewed as 
related to the national plan and the people's livelihood, such 
as grain, had their prices opened up comprehensively, 
implementing a policy of relying on the market fixed price for 
the most part and totally abolishing the grain ration, with the 
former ration provision shifted to free purchase in the market. 
Although there still cannot be grain exchange between farmers 
and government without government involvement, this type of 
participation has to be regulated in accordance with supply and 
demand. 
  When grain supplies are plentiful, a limited portion begins 
to appear in the purchasing market, less is expended on grain 
consumption and possible rises in price after opening up the 
market do not create huge pressures on the average person's 
life. Promptly opening up grain distribution and prices was a 
successful step, offering new experiences in "reform must seek 
opportunities." 
  Shifting grain distribution along with market adjustment, 
fixing grain exchange prices according to supply and demand, 
demonstrated that China had successfully passed the difficult 
point in price reform, and also bolstered our confidence in the 
marketization of housing and rental price reform. 
  2. Building a modern enterprise system was put on the 
agenda 
  Building a modern enterprise system is a basic item in the 
comprehensive reform plans issued in 1993. It broadened our 
vision of enterprise reform, and showed that deepening 
enterprise reform was not just a matter of carrying out 
relaxation of operational rights or clarifying property rights. 
But it should select and reorganize enterprises' organizational 
form in accordance with fair competition and perfecting 
efficiency in combination with relaxation of operational rights 
and clarification of property rights. There are two fundamental 
meanings here: one, is that in accelerating the transformation 
of the state-owned enterprise system, whether we should go the 
way of incorporation, how much should be run by local people, 
how much do we implement the joint stock system, how much should 
we retain the unitified state ownership form with local 
operation, all must be determined solely by the demands of the 
developing market and not by artificial will, and even less is 
it necessary to set a quota figure in advance; two, it would be 
suitable to creating a fair competition situation for the 
various types of enterprises, including state-owned, collective, 
and privately owned enterprises, in addition to requiring a 
unified tax system, there should be permission given for capital 
and labor force to circulate freely. 
  3. Initial progress in marketization of key elements 
  Taking establishment of a modern enterprise system as the 
basic mission of microscopic reform logically raises the 
question of marketizing key elements. In 1993, financing 
channels in China tended to be pluralized, the amount of 
currency freely exchanged in the currency market increased, 
especially in the foreign currency exchange market, the 
government reduced quota restrictions, and broaden the space for 
automatic adjustment in market supply and demand. In the 
dangerous situation of abnormal devaluation of the renminbi, the 
government did not artificially restrict the price level but 
used the means of raising the interest rate while selling 
government reserves of gold and foreign currency, in order to 
narrow the gap between foreign currency supply and demand, and 
altering enterprises' and individuals' expectations of currency 
value, and stabilizing the market. This is significant in that 
it not only did not put any obstacles in the way of further 
currency and fiscal reform, it also pointed out the possibility 
and feasibility of establishing a unified currency rate system. 
  In a country like China, with an almost unlimited labor 
supply, the development of a labor market, especially the 
establishment of a labor market in the area of the state-owned 
economy, will be an important reform project. In 1993, there 
were two areas in the development of a labor market in the 
state-owned economy that showed initial progress: one was the 
establishment of an internal labor market, that is, "one plant 
with two systems" an arrangement which increased the flexibility 
of capital inside enterprises and reorganized labor; the other 
was the establishment of the second job market, breaking the old 
pattern in which labor could not flow between state ownership 
and non-state ownership. 
  4. Accelerated development of the private economy 
  Another important achievement of reform in 1993 was the 
accelerated development of the individual and privately owned 
economies. These characteristically were demonstrated in: 1) 
There was a rapid increase in the number of new registrations. 
Taking the first quarter as an example, there were 153.000 new 
private commercial and industrial registrations in addition to 
the base of 15.53 million registered in 1992 nationally, an 
increase of over 10 percent. Shanghai had a net increase of 
2,000 families in the first half year, with 10 new businesses 
starting up every day; Dalian had 1,284 new registrations in the 
first half of the year, a 540 percent increase. 2) Private 
capital joining state-owned enterprises is quite outstanding. 
There were 34 state-owned and township collective silk industry 
enterprises in Huzhou, Zhejiang which implemented joint 
public-private ownership, with the private share being 60 to 80 
percent, and these had a 100 percent rate of success. At 
present, individual business and private owned business are not 
only knocking at the doors of big cities, but also at the door 
of the state-owned and collective economies, and their 
developmental trend is bright. Although these facts are not 
obvious results of reform measures, to a certain degree, they 
can be looked upon as "self-reforms," closely connected with 
government relaxation of the ownership structure policy. 
  5. Initial achievements in reform of the social 
insurance system 
  Since the nineties, national health care, housing, 
retirement 
and provision for the elderly have been raised to an important 
position, but the pace was not stepped up until comrade Deng 
Xiaoping made his speech during his inspection tour of southern 
China, and 1993 was a year of significant acceleration. Taking 
housing reform as an example, each locality implemented "walking 
on two legs," which means "raise rents, offer subsidies" and 
preferential sales. Some carried out this raising of rent while 
offering subsidies in three steps, some in one. Although rents 
and housing prices generally tended to be low, at a considerable 
distance from the current market price, it must be considered 
that in a total reform measure, taking the first step is very 
important. It is unrealistic to try to accomplish marketization 
of the welfare system in one step. 
  In addition to the several areas listed above, 1993 also saw 
some reform actions by government administrative organs in such 
areas as finance and tax revenue distribution safety, the 
external environment for enterprises, etc. However, reform in 
these areas basically have not jumped out of the traditional 
planned economy framework. Looking at what is required to 
develop a new economic system, they are obviously backward. The 
lack of progress in reform of these areas is precisely an 
important source of the conflicts and problems produced in the 
present dual system. 
<H5>  Background of the New System: Contradictions and Difficulties </H5>
  Reform has entered a new stage. It is impossible for things 
to always go smoothly when there is a transition from shallow to 
deep, from gradual to accelerated, from parts to a whole set of 
reform supports; there will be many contradictions and 
difficulties. If we say that reform in the eighties was solely a 
confrontation with the monolithic system of the traditional 
planned economy, while all other neglected tasks had to wait for 
construction, still people were so eager for reform that even 
superficial reform had a somewhat positive effect. The nineties 
mean dealing with the implementation of a complete set of 
supports for reform and development at a deep level in a 
situation where a dual, mutually conflicting system exists, and 
the difficulties are greater. Moreover the major tasks in the 
new stage of reform, i.e., the property rights mix, 
reorganization of employment, total marketization of the welfare 
provision system, remolding the financial system into 
competitive banking, reorganizing governmental functions to meet 
the demands of the market economy, etc., will all probably 
present a challenge to current profit takers at each level. New 
conflicts may arise, as will the difficulties of economic 
reality and the operational process of reform. 
  Let us start first of all with conversion of the enterprise 
system, especially state-owned enterprises. This mission has 
been suggested for several years, but it was only in 1993 that 
establishment of a modern enterprise system was proposed. 
Realistically, it has always been difficult to make fundamental 
breakthroughs. In the past several years, many people have 
attributed the causes of this to unliberated ideas and old 
theoretical understanding, but the problem is by no means that 
simple. If we assume that before the 3d Plenary Session of the 
14th Party Central Committee, the task was to smash traditional 
ideas about reform of state-owned property rights, and the ideas 
of "clarifying property rights" and stepping up the pace of 
property rights reform were written into the "Decisions," with 
unanimous agreement, can it then be said that when conditions 
are ripe, conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and 
establishment of a modern enterprise system will be successful? 
No. 
  Conversion of the state-owned enterprise system and 
establishment of a modern enterprise system means accelerating 
the reorganization of employment, and reorganizing employment 
will definitely means reductions in the numbers of employees, 
and a considerable number of current employees will be 
dismissed. Once it has been decided to develop a market economy 
and establish fair competition, we have must be duty-bound not 
to turn back on establishing and developing a labor force 
market, for with the promotion of efficiency and competition, 
unemployment is unavoidable. That was why in the reform plan of 
1987-88, we proposed "marketizing employment, and public 
unemployment," for a market economy without some unemployment 
and a labor force market are unimaginable. In state-owned 
enterprises, the difficulty in implementing this plan is not 
that workers cannot grasp the concept, but rather in the lack of 
a suitable external environment. Public housing and pensions are 
now assumed by work units, so if large numbers of people are 
dismissed, they will be left in society with neither salary, a 
place to live, or health and welfare benefits; how will they 
live? Among the 150 million employee contingents we have today, 
110 million, or two-thirds, are state employees; even if we 
dismiss just one-tenth of these, more than 10 million will 
remain. Calculated by a burden coefficient of 1.72, it means 
over 27.2 million people may well be in the situation of having 
nothing, and being homeless. In addition, China has a surplus 
agricultural labor force of over 100 million which must be 
shifted to non-agricultural industry, an average of more than 13 
million annually who reach the age of coming into the work 
force, plus a possible 10 to 30 million people dismissed from 
collective enterprises. These will all bring huge pressures to 
relocate surplus labors in state-owned work units. 
  On the one hand, we should resolve unemployment in 
state-owned work units through bankruptcy and the system of the 
excellent winning while the inferior are deleted; on the other 
hand, it is difficult for surplus people to find new job 
positions, as well as their family members not having 
protection. While this will not be a difficult point in this and 
the next year's reform, it will be a major conflict and 
difficult situation in the second stage of reform. 
  In addition, the first 15 years of reform generally smashed 
the original, excessively concentrated, centralized system, some 
of the control rights which originally were the central 
government's have been transmitted to the market and local 
governments through releasing rights to enterprises and local 
governments, but in the meantime there also appeared the 
phenomenon of local government having excessive rights. At 
present, there are three problems with the behavior of local 
governments: one is adverse adjustment toward higher levels; two 
is direct interference with lower; three is obstructing their 
neighbors. These three have the common objective of protecting 
local profits. Out of its need to develop the socialist market 
economy, China must establish unified markets in all areas, 
establish equal competition in localities, allow enterprises not 
only to rid themselves of administrative control from the 
central government, but also rid themselves of direct 
interference from local governments, promoting each level of 
government to act only a supply service, as all microeconomic 
major bodies of government, especially local governments, must 
accept adjustment by markets. The current situation far exceeds 
this requirement. 
  Local governments' adverse adjustment and control toward 
higher levels is found chiefly during periods of economic 
adjustment. Whenever the central government cannot implement 
policy either totally or mixed, it is generally due to not to 
enterprises but to local governments. This is because when the 
central government attempts to slow things down, stifling the 
economy from being too hot, those regions which are already too 
hot are usually in compliance in public but in opposition in 
private. Although in report charts, the statistics figure show a 
reduced rate of speed, yet in practice, there remains an 
insistence on high speed to resolve regional employment and 
improve the level of regional development; on mix adjusting, 
although the central government has repeatedly stressed 
accelerated development of transportation and telecommunication, 
etc., in bottleneck industries by means of cooling down 
manufacturing. Because manufacturing brings high value and large 
profits, while basic industry is more long-term, local 
governments usually put labor resources, material resources and 
financial resources into manufacturing industry, so there is 
always an unsatisfactory mix. Thus, resistance at present to 
total amount and mix adjustment is not from enterprises but from 
local governments. 
  Local governments' direct intervention with lower levels is 
becoming stronger as the release of rights expands with reform. 
This intervention is aimed chiefly at three targets: one is 
enterprises, two is banks, three is the peasants. They complain 
of excessive assignment of labor force, money, and materials, 
"too many mothers-in-law." Actually, most of these are the 
activities of local governmental organs. This direct 
intervention with the main entities of the market, and 
especially with banks, seriously impedes the normal development 
of the market economy. 
  Local protectionism or local economic impedances not only 
cause duplicated construction among different regions and 
products and similar technology choices, but also impedes the 
establishment of a unified national market. 
  Local governments' non-marketized activities higher, lower, 
left and right have become a major contradiction in current 
economic operations and reform. Due to local governments have 
considerable power, strong economic force, a complicated 
situation with economic conditions and unbalanced profits, etc., 
added to the reduction in the central government's powers, there 
are no corresponding regulations restricting the activities of 
local governments, so converting local governments' function 
will become a difficult point in the new stage. The simple tax 
division system can only resolve the distribution of tax 
revenues between the central government and localities; it 
cannot accomplish the goal of redefining local government's 
function in accordance with the demands of the market economy. 
  Second, there is a problem with lagging financial system 
reform. After 15 years' reform, China's financial channels have 
begun to develop toward multiple elements. In addition to 
deposits and bank loans, there are government and enterprise 
bonds, stocks, and other forms of raising funds. However, 
capital distribution is still affected greatly by the supply 
system, and in a certain sense, the "external circulation" of 
capital has more of a market component than does "internal 
circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more 
non-market component is that banks have not been separated from 
government. The Bank of China not only is not an independent 
unitary organ with the right to issue currency, it cannot make 
its own decisions regarding adjustment of currency supply and 
price levels. It is controlled by administrators in the central 
government, but in addition each of the specialized banks 
(especially branch banks) have their credit and loans controlled 
by local governments; they do not obey markets but local 
administrators. Meanwhile, banks continue to maintain the state 
monopoly, rejecting the elimination system, and the lack of 
competition also results in too tight control of "internal 
circulation," which make the direction of application 
unreasonable and inefficient. 
  Under market economic conditions, finance is at the center 
of 
domestic economic activities, the banks are the adjustment 
center, and interest rates are determined by market supply and 
demand of capital. However, finance, banking, and interest rates 
in China are at present still operated directly by the 
government. Changing this pattern, making an independent, 
multiple element, competitive, and efficient new financial 
system has naturally become a third theme and a difficult point 
in the new stage of reform. The key here is to resolve conflicts 
of interest and distribution of rights between government and 
enterprises, and between the central government and local 
governments. 
<H5>  Key Choices for Accelerating the Marketization Process </H5>
  In the first 15 years, the outstanding achievement of 
converting the economic system in China is the establishment of 
a price competition system, with the single planned, price 
setting of the past changed into setting price in the market 
with government supervision. The focal point of reform in 1994 
and in the entire new stage is converting the state-owned 
enterprise system, and around this focal point, the launching 
and breakthroughs in reform will be from the following several 
aspects. 
  1. Establish a modern enterprise system 
  The major battlefield for 1994 and future economic reform is 
in the state-owned enterprises, that is, converting the current 
state-owned enterprise system into a modern enterprise system. 
In order to attain this goal, we must implement creativity in 
both the internal and external state-owned enterprise system. 
The theme of internal reform is still property rights reform, 
while external reform includes three basic aspects, i.e., the 
welfare system, the role of government, and the financial system. 
  In the transformation of the state-owned property right 
administrative system, theoreticians are increasing their 
demands for organizing and building up the limited 
responsibility corporation and the joint stock limited 
corporation. So this is a certain measure toward establishing a 
modern enterprise system and a modern market system. Under a 
joint stock system there are many levels one can choose, with 
wide coverage, big corporations doing big shares, small 
corporations doing small shares, allowing free purchase of 
shares both by organizations who represent the state's and 
residents' interests in joint stock. This form of property 
rights organization can cut across cities and countryside, 
regions and countries; it helps the flow of capital flow and 
capital's concentration and decomposition. But, facing the huge 
scale of state-owned asset property rights that we have now, 
simply creating a joint stock limited corporation may not be 
practical; one needs to consider a variety of alternatives. In 
addition to developing joint stock limited corporations, there 
should be appropriate development of two enterprise property 
organization forms: a cooperative rights system and independent, 
individual capital. These should be developed together by system 
change, auction, lease, contracting and sales, etc. In the 
process of reorganizing property rights, there is no doubt we 
will absorb the "corporate culture" of enterprise operations in 
Europe and America, but we must in no way ignore the "individual 
and family culture" preserved from China. Chinese economic booms 
in Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia have proven that the 
latter can also be combined skillfully with the modern market 
economy. In order to develop and expand the latter two property 
rights organizational forms, we can on the one hand sell small 
state-owned enterprises to individuals and families, while on 
the other hand carry out reorganization of the system by selling 
some segments which are unsuitable to capital concentration, for 
example, selling some branch plants to individuals and families, 
giving them the freedom to choose the property rights 
organizational form. Regardless of what means are employed to 
reform the enterprise system, there must be strict checks on 
capital and assets clarified, doing a good job in assets 
evaluation to prevent the nation from losing assets. 
  Implementing enterprise reform must combine internal and 
external reform. The principal cause of inefficiency in 
converting the enterprise system over the past few years has 
been the lack of a better external environment. Enterprises 
which should be eliminated cannot be eliminated, redundant 
personnel who should be dismissed cannot be dismissed, because 
it is hard to find a job again, benefit allocations are attached 
to work units so lack mobility, and employees leaving work units 
face loss of their current residences, medicare, pensions and 
other benefits supplied by their work units. In order to 
accelerate the transformation of the enterprise system in the 
next several years, the first step is to accelerate 
socialization and marketization in benefits allocation. This 
will include: 
  1) Establishing a system of socialized unemployment, old age 
insurance and medical insurance, establishing a nationwide 
social insurance bureau, allowing insurance companies to operate 
in multiple forms and with full responsibility for their profits 
and losses. This will create a situation where workers' and 
their family members' medicare, pensions and unemployment will 
neither be attached to work units, nor having trouble at home. 
  2) Reform the current work unit housing allocation system, 
having all publicly-owned housing managed by corporate 
enterprises. Housing reform over the past few years stressed the 
point of trying to raise housing prices, reducing the financial 
burden of government and enterprises through building houses by 
raising house prices and then selling some houses at discounted 
prices. This still has not accomplished the commercialization 
and marketization of housing. The difficulty here is not that 
residents lack the ability to bear rising rents, or this is too 
complex in operation, but rather that the commercialization of 
public housing must first of all be socialized. We must convert 
housing allocation by work units to allocation by socialized 
corporations. Only after housing is socialized will it become 
possible for the labor force to flow freely among different 
enterprises. 
  3) For enterprise reform, a good external environment must 
also include a flexible capital reorganizing system. China's 
current enterprise system is a system in which "workers will be 
workers forever, managers will always be managers." There are 
all kinds of limitations on capital reorganization, such as the 
"threshold is too high," there are excessive restrictions on 
registering new corporations through requiring the approval of 
many departments. But after registration it is difficult to file 
for bankruptcy, just the opposite of the "easy to register but 
hard to stay in business" situation which prevails in developed 
countries. If this abnormal phenomenon cannot be changed, it 
will be unfavorable to establishing a bankruptcy and 
unemployment system in enterprises either. If workers lose their 
jobs and cannot find employment in other work units, some of 
them can collect funds or obtain loans to establish stores or 
plants, becoming employers. More small enterprises in existence 
means the absorption of more of the labor force, as well as 
providing alternatives for surplus labor in state-owned work 
units. 
<H5>  2. Transforming the Role of Government on Two Levels </H5>
  The basic condition for establishing a modern enterprise 
system is the elimination of direct governmental intervention, 
and this requires transforming the role of government, 
especially that of local government. First of all, separate 
government from enterprises, carry out a common policy of 
"enterprises without mothers-in-law", do not permit government 
administrative departments to directly involve themselves with 
enterprises' activities. Government should only take care of 
legislation, formulate regulations, collect taxes, and regulate 
enterprises' activities through economic policies that either 
stimulate or cool down, and all of these accomplished by market 
parameters. For projects with direct government investment, we 
should still entrust incorporated enterprises to undertake these 
but not have them operated by government administrative organs. 
All government management activities are public matters, and 
include setting and implementing local tax regulations after 
implementation of a tax division system, ecological environment 
administration and public investment in infrastructural projects 
at the local level, etc. 
  Carrying out the transformation of governmental functions 
can 
be considered on two levels: one is the function of the central 
government (here we are only talking about the economic 
function), two is the function of local government. In 
principle, the chief function of the central government can be 
regarded as: 1) carrying out macroadjustment and control of the 
domestic economy, including macroemployment and inflation, 
currency supply and interest rate level, the national tax 
standard and economic growth and balance administration; 2) 
national level social insurance arrangements, including poverty 
and unemployment relief; arranging for retirement and care for 
the aged and subsidies for military people, etc.; 3) 
construction of interprovincial infrastructural facilities; and 
4) developing natural resource monopolies and high tech, 
education, and research on a massive scale. 
  Local governments should only undertake public affairs 
within 
their local sphere; there are chiefly two basic divisions 
between their role and that of the central government: one is 
division of scale, in that the central government governs an 
entire entity, while local governments govern only parts; the 
second is that localities lack macroeconomic adjustment and 
control powers in such matters as the issuance of currency and 
its circulation, etc. The only direct relationship between these 
two levels of government and enterprises is revenue, with all 
other regulatory activities conducted via two intermediaries: 
the law and the market. 
<H5>  3. Model an Independent, Multi-Element, Competitive </H5>
Financial System 
  Establishment of a modern enterprise system requires the 
support of the modern financial system. At present, in addition 
to suffering from too much government intervention in supplying, 
selling, and pricing of goods and in the employment of people, 
state-owned enterprises also lack the power to make their own 
choices in the use of capital. The capital distribution system 
is still in effect. It is not simply a problem of the banks' 
administration level: the key is factor is that the banking 
business also suffers from interference by government officers. 
The reason is that specialized banks are not incorporated, nor 
are they separate from government. In developed market economy 
countries, no matter whether commercial banks which operate by 
enterprise methods or central banks which implement currency 
policy, the controlling balance between currency supply and 
demand, the regulation and control of overall interest rate 
levels are all independent, and any direct interference by 
government administrative organs is illegal. This explains why 
their banking system is highly independent, because they are 
responsible for macroeconomic balance. America has the most 
advanced banking system in the world, with the greatest degree 
of independence. While banks in Japan and Germany are subject to 
more interference from government, this kind of interference is 
indirect, and usually must be implemented by legal means. When 
designing and constructing the new banking system in China, we 
can refer to the Japanese and German experience, and learn from 
the American model. 
  Regarding enterprise reform, there is also a problem of 
inducing the competition system in financial system reform. At 
present, all of our banks are run by the state, in a kind of 
monopolistic operation without competition. Would it be possible 
to try operating the banks on a joint stock system? Everyone is 
very cautious about this question, because it is harder to 
control than those assets in material form, such as land, real 
estate and enterprises. Problems which arise in the reform of 
material assets are easier to handle than those which arise in 
the reform of financial assets. Plus, if the government 
regulations on bank administration are unclear, it is easy 
succumb to the lure of reaping staggering profits, so the income 
gap caused by policy will be too sharp. There must be 
appropriate controls on taxes on part of the income from bank 
differential interest rate, and in addition, banks' activities 
must be regulated by a corresponding set of legal regulations. 
All of this requires very cautious and strict consideration. 
Therefore, before launching bank system reform, we must make it 
a goal that the new banking system "take state ownership as the 
dominant factor, with multiple forms of ownership forms 
coexisting". There should be a process for preparing legislation 
and system design. When the situation is still not ripe, there 
should be no rush to implement joint stock or privatized capital 
banks. But this should be considered for the long term. Modeling 
an independent, multiple-element, competitive bank finance 
system to develop the socialist market economy is inevitably the 
road we will take. 
<H5>  4. Establish a System in Which Every Citizen Pays Taxes and </H5>
There Is Public Financing 
  Enterprises are the principal entity of the market, 
developing the market economy depends first and foremost upon 
establishing this market principal entity. However, the 
socialist market economy is not a free, laissez-faire economy: 
the degree of government intervention is stronger and the scale 
of government intervention is wider than in the Western market 
economy. One of the former's important characteristics is that 
it achieves more fairness by means of reallocation. This 
involves the problem of national taxes, and involves the problem 
of the distribution relationship between the "state" and the 
"people." 
  The chief measure for handling the distribution relationship 
between the "state" and the "people" is the tax. More taxes mean 
more benefits go to the state, while less taxes mean more 
benefits go to the people. Before the implementation of reform, 
the tax system in China was very simple, having a very small 
number of varieties, low tax rates and little change. The major 
reasons for this were: one, there were no privately owned 
enterprises, and the state-owned enterprises turned over profits 
instead of taxes; two, both urban and rural residents generally 
had low incomes, so paid no income tax; three, farmers paid in 
grains in lieu of tax. Since the implementation of reform some 
changes have occurred: the state-owned enterprises are carrying 
out the policy of converting profits into taxes; privately owned 
enterprises and other types of enterprises have become more 
important taxpayers; with the rising incomes of both urban and 
rural dwellers, personal income tax has been produced and 
expanded; the tax on farmers' materials have been converted into 
currency taxes. With the tax system changed, in order to prevent 
the national treasury from drying up, the tax system should 
correspondingly be reformed; there should be corresponding 
adjustments in both the varieties and rates of taxes, and these 
should be implemented by means of strong and powerful measures. 
In the past several years, we did not attain this point, and 
policies concerning this aspect had some deviation. This policy 
deviation was due to the old tax system growing increasingly 
unsuitable to the new economic situation. So, accelerating tax 
system reform has become an urgent matter. 
  Recently, tax system reform has been listed as a very 
important issue among five major reform issues, which 
demonstrates that the central government is giving a great deal 
of attention to the problems which exist in the tax system. But 
if we look at the publicity and implementation of policy, it 
seems that there has been more emphasis on resolving the tax 
division system of revenue relationship between the central 
government and localities. It is no doubt very important to 
carry out a tax division system, as it can clarify the tax 
allocation of rights, responsibilities and benefits between the 
central government and localities. This will lay the foundation 
for smashing the huge, monolithic, central government-intensive 
type of financial system, and result in the future in less 
wrangling between the central government and localities, and 
among localities themselves, freeing each level of government to 
concentrate on it regular work well, and improving the 
efficiency of governmental activities. However, we cannot limit 
ourselves to this if we are to establish a new tax system 
suitable to developing the socialist market economy; it is 
urgent that we establish an uniform tax payment system that 
involves every citizen. 
  Now, evading taxes has almost become a habit with 
businessmen, and the taxes evaded increase or decrease with the 
amount of income. If we do not pay urgent attention to building 
the system and legal restrictions, it could possibly lead to the 
people growing prosperous while the state becomes impoverished. 
The basic points of the tax system reform to be implemented soon 
should not be an increase or reduction in taxes, but should be a 
complete tax, which means collecting all taxes that should be 
paid. We can consider establishing a uniform system of tax 
payment involving every citizen in three aspects: 1) work out 
detailed, well-organized tax collection regulations, including 
the division between national taxes and local taxes, tax 
varieties, tax rates, deadlines, scale, penalty rules, etc.; the 
more the detail the better the tax law. 2) Establishing a strict 
tax reporting system, fixing an annual legal tax reporting term, 
with individuals and business owners required to report taxes to 
government tax departments before the deadline. Once tax evasion 
is discovered, there should be an audit of the past few years' 
total income and tax report documents, and strict punishment 
levied. This will form a habit of tax reporting for individuals 
and business owners by the threat of strict punishment. 3) 
Establish a two-level system of national tax administration for 
both central government and provinces, giving tax officers full 
authority to implement the state's tax laws, and no government 
administrator can reduce or exempt taxes for individuals or 
business owners which exceed the powers of tax officers, for any 
reasons. 4) All individuals, regardless of their status, 
citizenship, age and gender, must pay their taxes in accordance 
with the same law. There can be consideration of implementing an 
employee chart system in which all employees must have 
employees' charts, as well as showing tax payment forms, letting 
government restrict employers, and employers restrict employees. 
When opening deposit accounts or opening accounts with currency 
exchange organizations, the tax form must be attached when 
providing identification. 
  Operation of the socialist market economy must be based on 
an 
extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundmental, 
major laws in a nation's economy. Comprehensively accelerating 
reform of the tax law is a very urgent part of accelerating 
reform of the entire economic system. 
  Tax system reform is actually reform of the state's 
financial 
income system. Once equal competition is implemented, and 
state-owned and other enterprises operate under the same tax 
law, the state's tax revenues may shrink in scale, so government 
expenditures will shrink in turn, which will require adjusting 
the government's financial role. Our present government finances 
are still comprehensive finances, and after releasing rights and 
profits, in the original monolithic revenue and expenditure 
financial model, unified revenues shrank at a faster pace than 
the unified expenditures did, causing a steady increase in the 
financial deficit. In 1985, our financial surplus was 2.16 
billion yuan, and in 1992 we had a 23.66 billion yuan financial 
deficit. If there is no adjustment in the pattern of revenue and 
expenditure, the deficit will continue to grow, even if there is 
repeated removal of educational funds. The basic way to resolve 
the current financial difficulty is not to raise taxes ("digging 
out resources"), and there should be no reductions in scientific 
and educational funds ("cutting expenses"); rather, there can 
only be fundamental reform of the financial revenue and 
expenditure system, and this means moving the comprehensive 
finances we have now to public financing, except that investment 
in natural monopolies, extremely huge scale, national defense, 
and some fundmental industries will continue to be government 
expenditures, and the government should use capital which it 
controls to provide social guarantees and other public affairs. 
So, establishing a system of public finance will become one of 
the basic missions of reform starting in 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Xiao Feng (2556 0023): "Shareholding System </F>
Reform Achieves Eight Great Progresses in '93--Throughout the 
Nation There Are Nearly 10,000 Newly Added Shareholding System 
Enterprises, Reaching a Grand Total of More Than 13,000"] 
  [Text] Authorities from relevant national departments have 
revealed that, in 1993 Chinese shareholding system reform as the 
core of the structuring of a modern enterprise system with 
greater speed and greater stability expanded the area of 
development and achieved distinct advances in the following 
eight areas. 
  ---Speed. According to incomplete statistics from some 
provinces and cities throughout the nation as of the end of 
1993, during the year at least 9,440 new shareholding system 
enterprises were added, of which 2,968 were limited stock 
companies, 6,472 were limited liability companies, and 1,776 
were internally held stock companies. The cumulative total of 
shareholding system enterprises throughout the nation reached as 
high as 13,000. Total capital stocks were 208.632 billion yuan 
and, as of 31 December, there were 122 shareholding companies on 
the market. Throughout the nation there were 51 securities 
registering organizations and as many as 25 million 
stockholders. In 1993 there were a total of 174 types of A 
stocks from surface and in-depth brokers on the market, a 235 
percent increase over 1992. There were a total of 41 types of B 
stocks from the two types of stock brokers, a 128 percent 
increase over 1992. Compared to the same point in 1992 (31 
December), the total 1993 market value (for A and B stocks) 
increased by 308 percent; the volume of transactions increased 
by 572 percent; and the amount of transactions increased by 552 
percent. In 1993 there were a total of 17 types of legal person 
stocks on the market, a 467 percent increase over 1992. At the 
same point in time (31 December), according to the calculation 
of comparable specifications, in 1993 the volume of legal person 
stock transactions increased by 186 percent and the amount of 
the transactions increased by 140 percent over 1992. In 
addition, last year China also added the legal person stock 
circulating market, NET system. 
  ---Expanded Scope. The shareholding system enterprise model 
has rapidly expanded to all trades and professions, from 
industry to commerce, villages, cultural organizations, athletic 
departments, and schools all have actively initiated 
shareholding system experiments. A number of privately owned and 
collective enterprises in the area of new and advanced 
technology also discarded their former model of ownership and 
shifted to shareholding system enterprises. Numerous newly 
established enterprises and newly established projects (such as 
the Three Gorges Project) conscientiously use the shareholding 
system function to help to rapidly raise funds and clearly 
define property rights. 
  ---Going on external markets, winning the initial victory. 
In 
1993 nine large national enterprises were designated as the 
first batch to go on external markets. By the end of the year, 
six enterprises already had accomplished this task. In the short 
period of six months, six large and medium-sized national 
enterprises on external markets had as much as HK$272.8 billion 
in frozen external funds (not including globally raised 
amounts), 72.6 times the funds raised in the plan. In addition, 
the people-run enterprise, Sitong Group, also raised 180 million 
in Hong Kong. The merger clearly was successful. 
  ---Progress in the legal framework is gratifying. At the 
beginning of last year, the State Council promulgated the Notice 
on Further Strengthening Macroeconomic Controls on Securities 
Markets, establishing the keynote for this year's national 
regulation of the securities market. In April the State Council 
issued the Provisional Regulations on Administering the Issuing 
and Trading of Stocks to provide China's shareholding operations 
with an embryonic framework. Subsequently, rules and regulations 
for such things as disclosing information, establishing a 
securities exchange, and guarding against securities fraud were 
implemented one after the other. The most gratifying was that at 
the end of the year the first major national law, the Company 
Law of the People's Republic of China, was passed by the Fifth 
Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National 
People's Congress and was formally promulgated. The legal 
framework of the Chinese stock system is gradually entering the 
"three dimensional" stage. 
  ---The interior and remote border province regions are no 
longer silent. Such "developing provinces and regions" as 
Shanxi, Nei Mongol, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, 
Xinjiang, and Tibet, unwilling to be left behind, are actively 
engaging in experiments with the shareholding system. Especially 
Tibet ended the historical gap in experimenting with the 
shareholding system and in a standard and reliable way developed 
four shareholding system enterprises, and Lhasa opened a 
securities exchange business department. In addition, such 
places as Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and Shanxi successfully 
issued stocks to society. 
  ---Remarkable performance convinces people. 
  (1) Enterprise economic performance: Thirty Shanghai 
companies comparably strong on the market realized an average 
128 percent increase in profits from January through June 1993. 
These indices far exceeded other types of enterprises. 
  (2) State asset performance. Stock-issuing premium 
coefficients were higher than state asset appraised reinvestment 
coefficients. For example, after the state assets of 10 Shanghai 
enterprises were appraised, the rate of increased value rose by 
56.98 percent and the rate of new assets put into production 
increased by 10.52 percent. It is obvious that in the reform of 
the shareholding system the rights and interests of state assets 
were fully guaranteed. 
  (3) Stockholder performance: In the first half of 1993, the 
rate of repayment to stockholders of the first 30 companies on 
the market was generally between 30 percent and 101 percent. The 
majority of the outstanding repayment companies on the market 
were concentrated in Shenzhen, 76.7 percent. 
  ----Stock issuance went safely and smoothly. In 1993 for the 
first time in Chinese history, large-scale public stock 
solicitation activities were carried out in various places 
throughout the country. For this the State Council Securities 
Commission issued "1993 Stock Sales and Subscription 
Suggestions" and one after the other various places established 
"stock issuing headquarters," resolutely implemented the "three 
public" principle, and adopted the pattern of unlimited sale 
subscription certificates and savings account quota sale 
certificates. Throughout the year, stock issuing went safely and 
smoothly. That is, there was nothing like the "August 10" 
incident and excessively large first and second class market 
profit differentials were curbed. 
  ---Severely punish illegal activities and clean up the stock 
market environment. The Chinese government and securities 
control department have resolutely attacked such illegal 
activities as using stocks for private gain, black market 
trading, behind the scenes trading, leaking of information, 
corruption and accepting bribes, unlawful bond trading, and 
disturbing the stock market. For example, relevant departments 
have strongly and swiftly dealt fairly and seriously with such 
cases as the case of the president of the savings bank in Zibo 
city diverting 1.7457 million yuan in public funds to speculate 
on stocks; the case of the Guangzhou bond trader swindling 
customers; the case of a certain seventeen-year-old Shanghai 
youth cheating on securities; and false stocks and false 
purchasing certificates appearing everywhere. The cleaning up of 
the stock market environment has won the acclaim of the vast 
number of stockholders.

"Shanghai's Property Right Exchange Market Starts From Here: An 
Interview With Gong Jiemin"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: The "Shanghai Property 
Right Exchange Office" was established this year by approval 
document No. 1 of the Shanghai government. As a big and 
important step in deepening reform and perfecting the market 
system for the elements of production, it is attracting people's 
attention. The Shanghai Property Right Exchange Office will 
begin with exchanges of collective enterprises' property, and 
after achieving this will go on to gradually establish a 
large-scale, concentrated, public, regulated and orderly major 
property rights market. The "Shanghai Urban and Rural Property 
Right Exchange Office" will operate at a high starting point, 
with high standards and high efficiency, then gradually will 
link up with the domestic and overseas markets, connecting with 
the international property rights market. In order to help 
readers understand the establishment background, practical 
significance and operational form of the "Shanghai Urban and 
Rural Property Right Exchange Office, we will initially publish 
this special interview. 
  The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office 
is located in the Yipingxiang Building, at Alley 1277, Xietu 
Road, No 14. During the Lantern Festival with its deep 
atmosphere of spring, this reporter tracked down and interviewed 
the Chairman of the property right exchange office, Gong Jiemin 
[7895 0094 3046]. 
  Reporter: Why organize and establish a Shanghai 
Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office? 
  Chairman: The office was established after more 
than half a year's preparation and application to the Shanghai 
municipal government, and was jointly organized by the Shanghai 
Agriculture Commission, Municipal Office of System Reform, 
Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry, and the Municipal, 
Suburban, and County Industrial Bureau. It is another production 
element market, following Shanghai's 10 other exchange offices 
of securities, metals, agricultural materials, chemical 
industry, petroleum, coal, grains and edible oils, automobiles, 
construction materials, and technology. Although this market is 
a relative latecomer, it is a very important start. It is an 
important and big step for Shanghai's establishment of the 
socialist market system. It is an inevitable high level market 
after conducting further reform of enterprise property rights. 
It is a measure which will invigorate the entire situation in 
the chess game that is big trading, big circulation in Shanghai. 
These could be the reasons why the Shanghai government approved 
its organization and establishment in its No 1 document this 
year. 
  Reporter: Why do you say property right exchange 
is an important step to further reform? 
  Chairman: The property right is the property 
owners' (enterprise legal person and natural person) rights to 
the property. It includes rights of occupation, use (operation), 
receipt of profits and control. Property right exchange is a 
special marketing activity which takes property rights as the 
object of exchanging, with receiving profits from property 
rights as the goal. 
  The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office 
is an exchange office focusing on the whole body of enterprise 
property right transmission (taking the enterprise as a single 
commodity). 
  Prior to the implementation of reform and opening, an 
enterprise was an attachment to executive organs, not a 
commodity. Enterprise assets were non-liquid, property rights 
were fixed, a forbidden area for asset flow and reorganization. 
With the implementation of further reform, such production 
elements as capital, resources, technology, information, and 
labor gradually went into the market, and further developed 
enterprise asset property rights and some enterprise property 
right exchange, finally developing to the advanced market 
activity of the total enterprise property right going to the 
market. 
  Reporter: In establishing the office, why did you 
choose to start with urban and rural collective enterprise 
property right exchange? 
  Chairman: Enterprise property right exchange is a 
complex system. The major reasons for Shanghai selecting urban 
and rural collective enterprises to begin with are: 
  First, property rights for urban and rural collective 
enterprises are relatively clear. Enterprises run by teams are 
owned by the teams collectively, those run by villages are owned 
by the villages collectively, those run by towns are owned by 
townships collectively, and in a joint stock system ownership is 
by the shareholders. Occupation, use, and division of 
enterprises is quite clear in these enterprises. 
  Second, collective enterprise began and developed with the 
market economy. The enterprises' self-operation, personal 
responsibility for profits and losses, their self-development, 
and self-limiting system were all established and in operation 
early on; moreover, they have a stronger internal demand for 
exchange of property rights. 
  Third, it is easier to handle asset and real estate 
transferrals for urban and rural collective enterprises, and 
they are especially better at placing and absorbing workers than 
are state-owned enterprises in cities, so it is relatively easy 
to transfer entire enterprises. 
  Fourth, rural and urban collective enterprises have 
developed 
rapidly in this era of reform. Most enterprises have a 
comparatively short history, a light burden of retired workers, 
and are easy to transfer and cut debts, the amount owed to 
creditors. 
  Fifth, at present, urban and rural collective enterprises 
have considerable assets: there are nearly 20,000 collective 
enterprises in suburban Shanghai, with original value of over 25 
billion yuan in fixed assets. The registered capital of over 
3,000 foreign-funded enterprises is more than $3.5 billion. So 
potentially, the market for transfer of enterprises either in 
whole or in part is very wide. 
  Reporter: Why should property right transferral be 
concentrated in a property right exchange office? 
  Chairman: The governing principle for all market 
competition should be public, legal, fair, regulated and orderly 
conducting property rights exchange. Carrying out enterprise 
property rights exchange by concentrating it in a property right 
exchange office helps to break down divisions among regions, 
industries, departments, and ownership, to form an intensive and 
unified large market, and helps protect enterprise assets from 
losses, preserving and adding to their value. Concentrating the 
conduct of property right exchange in an exchange office is 
valuable in that it provides an information center which can 
help enterprises straighten out their reserve assets, and 
perfect the allocation of key production elements through 
reasonable property right exchange. At the same time, it also 
helps to regulate the relationships among enterprises, the 
market and the government, and protects the legal rights and 
profits of publicly owned capital based on public ownership by 
administrative, economic, and legal means. 
  Reporter: What is the organization and composition 
of the Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office? 
  Chairman: The Shanghai Urban and Rural Property 
Right Exchange Office will operate the chairman responsibility 
system under the direction of an administrative committee. It 
has three offices and five departments: the office of the 
chairman, management office, and general office; information 
department, overseas department, exchange department, legal 
department, and accounting department. 
  The intermediate organization for enterprise property rights 
exchange is the property rights brokering corporation; these are 
property rights brokers. 
  The property rights management corporation attached to the 
property rights exchange office is a property rights brokering 
corporation established in accordance with national laws, legal 
regulations, and temporary property rights management measures 
fixed by the property rights exchange office. 
  The property rights brokering corporation is divided into 
three types: in order to guarantee that the exchange market for 
urban and rural collective enterprises is concentrated, public, 
and regulated, they established brokering corporations at the 
district or county level which are based on the management of 
urban and rural collective enterprises. This was done to 
straighten out exchange and speed up circulation in the property 
rights market, by establishing a group of brokering corporations 
directly organized or supported by financial organs, big 
enterprise groups and foreign trade organs. There will be 
planned, situational development of overseas members and members 
outside of Shanghai. 
  Reporter: How will the Shanghai Urban and Rural 
Property Rights Exchange Office attain its goal of operating 
from a high starting point, with high standards and at a high 
level? 
  Chairman: At the outset of its operations, the 
Shanghai Urban and Rural Property Right Exchange Office will 
conduct "regulation, marketization, and modernization". 
  Regulation means conducting regulated operations according 
to 
rules. The exchange office fixes and organizes internal organs 
strictly according to the exchange office's rules, the 
administrative commission's rules, the exchange office's 
administrative methods, temporary management methods of property 
right brokering corporations, provisional membership management 
articles and founding organizations. Exchanges will adhere 
strictly to several proposals concerning property right exchange 
submitted by the Shanghai government and the regulations and 
orders in the property right brokering corporation's provisional 
administrative measures. The whole procedure of registering 
sales, evaluating assets, the standard exchange contract and 
agreement, any changes in property right and the registration of 
these changes will all be standardized documents. 
  Marketization and modernization mean that property right 
exchange activity must be a marketing activity, as well as using 
modern tools such as the computer to build up a highly efficient 
management system through use of internationally advanced 
exchange measures, concluding deals by matching pairs. This 
high-standard regulated exchange activity will expand the market 
coverage rate, and connect our property right exchange market 
with the international property right market.

<F P=106> [Article by Sun Yingzhuo (1327 2019 3820): "Shandong Use of </F>
World Bank Loans Inspected"] 
  [Text] It was the second day of the conference convened to 
inspect Shandong's utilization of World Bank loans. During the 
morning session, Vice Governor Song Fatang of Shandong, Director 
Nicholas Hope of the World Bank's China and Mongolia bureau, and 
an official from the World Bank office of the Ministry of 
Finance addressed the gathering on behalf of the provincial 
government, the World Bank, and the ministry, respectively. 
  Song Fatang began his remarks by expressing his warm welcome 
to World Bank officials who had come to Shandong for inspection 
and guidance purposes. He said, "There has consistently been 
good and effective cooperation between the province of Shandong 
and the World Bank since 1982. As of late 1993, Shandong had 
utilized a total of $824 million in World Bank loans distributed 
among 26 projects with a combined investment of 11.74 billion 
yuan. Of the total loan amount, almost 40 percent went to 
energy; 30 percent, agriculture; and the rest, communications, 
industry, and social development. Utilizing World Bank loans, 
Shandong has expanded projects in agricultural irrigation, 
highway construction, education, and public health; accelerated 
agricultural and economic development in impoverished areas; 
furthered the development of basic industries; and raised 
technical and managerial standards, all of which has had 
positive effects on economic and social development in Shandong. 
  Song Fatang noted in his speech that the signing of a loan 
agreement is but the first step in bilateral cooperation. 
Reviewing a project promptly and investigating and solving in 
time the problems that arise in the course of implementing a 
project are important ways to ensure that a project is completed 
successfully and meets expectations. The latest conference, he 
said, would do much to help Shandong utilize World Bank loans 
even better. He expressed the hope that the World Bank and the 
various ministries in the central government would continue to 
show interest in and support Shandong. 
  Mr. Hope expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm 
reception given him and others by the Shandong provincial 
government and the meticulous way the conference was put 
together. He said, "China's outstanding performance in executing 
World Bank loan projects is known to all. Currently 90 projects 
are under way with a total loan amount of $16 billion. Shandong, 
in particular, has accumulated a wealth of experience in 
implementing a variety of projects and for the most part 
compares very favorably with other provinces and nations. As 
China undertakes more and more World Bank-financed projects, 
inevitably a host of problems will occur. This conference is 
profoundly significant in that it gives us an opportunity to 
obtain a detailed understanding of the implementation of 
provincial-level projects." 
  Director Huang Kehua of the Shandong Finance Office 
presented 
a report on the inspection of Shandong's utilization of World 
Bank loans. He expressed the hope that cooperation between 
Shandong and the World Bank would cover an even broader area, 
including environmental protection, infrastructural development, 
social development, economic development in impoverished areas, 
and housing reform. Dawude, director of operations in the World 
Bank's representative office in China, devoted his report to a 
detailed description of the implementation of World 
Bank-financed projects in Shandong and had high praise for the 
specific way in which Shandong utilizes World Bank loans. 
  In the afternoon the conference broke up into small groups 
to 
discuss the financial issues of loan projects, cost and risk 
analysis, and other topics.

5461): "Shandong Patent Applications Fourth in Nation"] 
  [Text] According to information given reporters the other 
day by the Shandong Patent Bureau, there were 4,691 patent 
applications in the province last year, of which 4,019 were 
approved. In both the volume of applications and the approval 
rate, Shandong ranked fourth in the nation, making it a major 
patent province. 
  Of all patent applications, there were 812 inventions, 3,262 
new practical designs, and 617 industrial designs. Achievements 
that stood out at home or abroad accounted for a major share of 
patent applications, such as the light flour processing 
equipment, which filled a void within China and has been 
designated by the state for dissemination on a priority basis, 
and Type B silica gel, which reaches the most advanced level in 
the world. Also gratifying is the fact that patent applications 
in Jinan, Weihai, Weifang, Zibo, Jining, Rizhao, Dezhou, 
Liaocheng, and Binzhou were all up significantly compared with a 
year ago. 
  To convert patented technology into productive forces as 
soon 
as possible, the provincial patent bureau has always tackled 
patent implementation and protection as a priority with 
outstanding success. According to incomplete data, 2,108 
patented items were developed province-wide with combined sales 
of 5,823,000,000 yuan, generating 877 million yuan in profits 
and taxes and earning $421 million in foreign exchange. After 
their transformation into productive forces, some patented 
products have released enormous energy. The light flour 
processing equipment had over 200 million yuan in output last 
year, generating 60 million yuan in profits and taxes. Type B 
silica gel too generates over 1 million yuan in profits each 
year. As part of its patent work, the patent bureau tackles 
patent protection aggressively. It handled over 50 patent 
disputes last year and closed 90 percent of the cases. 
  Meanwhile, to encourage innovation and promote patent 
application by enterprises, the bureau has conducted patent 
selection activities the third time, giving out 15 golden awards 
and 51 outstanding awards, a powerful boost to the development 
of patenting.

"Shandong Sets Economic Pace for Nation"] 
  [Text] By grasping opportunities and deepening reform, 
Shandong has achieved sustained and steady economic growth, 
consolidating its lead over the country in 1993 by every 
economic indicator. 
  Shandong's gross provincial product reached 270,088,000,000 
yuan in 1993, second only to Guangdong's 314 billion yuan, up 
24.2 percent from a year ago and 11 percentage points higher 
than the national average. Shandong topped the nation in both 
the increase in gross agricultural output value and the gross 
agricultural output value, reaching 59.6 billion yuan and 99.4 
billion yuan, respectively. Its gross agricultural output value 
rose 14.3 percent, a full 10.6 percentage points higher than the 
national average, making Shandong far and away the leader in the 
nation. A bumper harvest was recorded for all major agricultural 
crops with the exception of cotton. Grain output broke the 40 
million ton barrier to hit 41 million tons, just a tad lower 
than Sichuan's 41,506,000 tons. While Shandong ranked second in 
grain output nationwide, it led the country in oil-bearing crop 
output and aquatic output, reaching 2,684,000 tons and 3,193,000 
tons, respectively. 
  The secondary industry increased its output value to 144.2 
billion yuan in 1993, below Guangdong's 156 billion yuan and 
Jiangsu's 150.5 billion yuan, respectively, making Shandong the 
third-placed province in the country, the same position it held 
last year. Gross industrial output value at the township level 
and above climbed 35.7 percent, the second fastest in all China, 
to 342.91 billion yuan, the third largest. Township-run industry 
grew by leaps and bounds last year, achieving an output value of 
104,287,000,000 yuan, the second largest in China. The mix of 
products was continuously adjusted and optimized. Among major 
industrial products, Shandong again topped the nation in the 
amount of electricity generated and crude salt and soda ash 
output and placed second in crude oil, cement, and cloth output. 
  By increasing investments and giving it preferential 
support, 
Shandong has helped its tertiary industry achieve robust growth. 
The industry's output value grew 66.2 billion yuan, or 32.5 
percent, in 1993, second only to Guangdong, marking the first 
time it expanded faster than either the primary or the secondary 
industry in the last decade. Already the development lag between 
it and the other two counties has begun to shrink. 
  The scale of capital construction expanded and the 
distribution became more reasonable. Investment in capital 
construction province-wide amounted to 25.8 billion yuan in 
1993, the fourth largest in China. Of the total investment of 
25.8 billion yuan, production-oriented investment made up 17.05 
billion yuan, the third largest in the nation, while 
non-production-oriented investment accounted for 8.75 billion 
yuan, the fifth largest. The drive by the provincial finance 
office to increase revenue and cut spending was remarkably 
successful. The province collected 19,443,000,000 yuan in 
revenue, the seventh largest, and spent 18,846,000,000 yuan, the 
fourth largest. 
  Circulation channels were unimpeded and prices rose less 
rapidly than elsewhere in the country. Gross social commodity 
retail sales in the province amounted to 99,384,000,00 yuan, the 
third largest in the nation. At 110.7 percent, Shandong's 
general retail price index was lower than the national average 
of 113.2 percent, securing for Shandong the 27th spot among the 
29 provinces and municipalities in the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Hui (0060 6540): "Theoretical and Practical </F>
Bases for Establishing Labor Unions in Rural Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Congress, 
China's rural enterprises have grown exponentially, developed 
rapidly and become an important component of the national 
economy that exerts significant leverage in building socialist 
modernization. By the end of 1992, the total number of rural 
enterprises reached 20.78 million, employing 105 million people, 
producing an annual output value of 177 million yuan, of which 
127 million yuan represented industrial output value or about 
one-third of China's total. The abrupt start and rapid 
development of rural enterprises represent an unanticipated 
major byproduct of the reform and opening policy as well as 
great historical progress in China's rural economic and social 
developments. Therefore, establishing rural enterprise labor 
unions by a planned and systematic approach, adjusting as 
required to the trend, firmly adhering to reality and testing 
the approach under different circumstances, has significant 
meaning in terms of promoting development of rural enterprises 
in China. 
<H5>  I. Theoretical Basis for Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor </H5>
Unions 
  Rural enterprise development is both an important component 
and a notable feature in establishing socialism with special 
Chinese characteristics; it is a road that socialist China must 
travel in order to industrialize. In carrying out 
industrialization, capitalist countries generally have built up 
industries by bankrupting agriculture and developed urban cities 
at the expense of rural areas. China as a socialist country 
cannot travel down this road. It is a fact of life that some 80 
percent of China's population live in rural areas. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the Party and Central Government, therefore, have 
advocated giving strong and enthusiastic support to the new 
initiatives represented by the rural enterprises, vigorously 
mobilizing millions of peasants to enter into industry and 
commerce, promoting a new model of laborers who "leave their 
farmland without leaving their village homes, and who work in 
factories without going into the cities," and accelerating and 
strengthening the growth and vigorous development not only of 
the labor rank and file but of the rural enterprises themselves. 
  Rural enterprise development is important not only in 
liberating and developing the society's productive force under 
Marxism, but also in terms of minimizing the three great 
discrepancies. For a developing socialist country like China 
with a large population and limited resources, the question of 
how to gradually eliminate the three great discrepancies and 
realize common prosperity has very serious theoretical as well 
as practical implications. Rural enterprise development opens up 
a major route for reducing the three great discrepancies by 
effectively strengthening grass-root political power in the new 
era represented by an industrial-agricultural alliance and at 
the same time maintaining the integrity of the socialist system. 
  Development of a market-oriented economy implies that more 
and more people will no longer depend on agriculture for their 
livelihood. China is in the early stages of socialism and will 
gradually be changing from an agricultural nation with a 
majority of population engaged in farming to a modern industrial 
nation in which nonfarm population will be in the majority. The 
rapid development of rural enterprises has changed the 
structures of industrial enterprises and labor rank and file 
concentrating in urban cities and areas. By 1992, among the 105 
million people employed in rural enterprises, approximately 20 
million were classified to be "of farming origin, now employed 
as laborer;" these people basically have completed the 
peasant-to-laborer transition and now possess the basic 
characteristics of the labor class. A majority of these laborers 
are found in the large and medium-sized cities and suburbs along 
the southeastern coastal areas, and mainly employed in 
enterprises operated by villages and townships. Although as a 
category these laborers originally came from rural areas, they 
have basically left agricultural pursuits to devote full-time to 
industrial production; their source of livelihood come from 
wages and their lives are increasing integrated with socialist 
production. Some of the rural enterprises have come close to or 
reached domestic and international advanced standards in terms 
of technological facilities, production scale, management 
standard and economic strength. Along the coastal areas and in 
the large and medium-sized cities and surrounding areas, there 
are many townships that now possess the special characteristics 
of modern life. The workers in these townships are radically 
different from the traditional peasants in methods of 
production, social living, economic and labor relationships as 
well as concept of values; these workers attach greater 
importance to the ideology of collectivism and to organizational 
rules and regulations and they themselves are becoming a major 
driving force in reform and opening and economic construction. 
<H5>  II. Establishing Labor Unions Is An Objective Requirement in </H5>
Rural Enterprise Development 
  Rural enterprise labor unions are the inevitable products at 
a certain stage of rural enterprise development. For rural 
enterprises to continue to develop rapidly, labor unions need to 
be established because of economic imperatives as well as the 
need for public support of the masses. 
  Rural enterprises have numerous advantages. From the time 
they were established, they have developed under market 
competition in which only the strong and fit survived, and they 
have demonstrated strong vitality. But in the process of 
development, several rather common contradictions have remained 
unresolved: First, the contradiction between the ideological and 
technical-cultural quality of the work force and the 
increasingly modernized enterprise management. According to 
studies, close to 20 percent of the rural enterprise work force 
has a cultural level of less than secondary or primary 
education, less than 3 percent has completed secondary schooling 
or specialized training, and some 43 percent of the total work 
force are employed in non-technical jobs. Second, the 
contradiction between the enterprise management and the lively 
and vigorous market operating system. Rural enterprises have 
their own lively special characteristics in production 
management, labor utilization, internal allocations, etc. But 
due to special circumstances and certain historic conditions, 
some rural enterprises are still weak in management. Third, the 
contradiction between the speeding up of enterprise development 
and the lack of coordination in labor relations. Many rural 
enterprises still have problems in labor utilization and 
allocation, working conditions and social welfare. 
  Establishing labor unions represents the urgent and sincere 
desire of the rural enterprise work force. The workers consider 
it honorable and satisfying to be members of the labor class by 
joining labor unions; their desire to join is increasing daily 
and they hope to exercise their democratic rights through the 
labor unions and, as union representatives, enter into 
discussions with management on enterprise production, labor 
utilization and protection and social welfare; they hope that 
labor union representatives can help maintain and protect their 
personal benefits; they also hope that labor unions can assist 
by providing them with opportunities for further study and 
training. The majority work force in rural enterprises has shown 
a great deal of enthusiasm for joining labor unions; according 
to a survey of 1,200 rural enterprise laborers conducted by Wuxi 
City, 86 percent of those surveyed indicated they would like to 
join labor unions. 
  Establishing labor unions also represents the desire of many 
rural enterprise party and government leaders. Faced with fierce 
market competition, many rural enterprise cadres in Suzhou City 
deeply feel the need to catch up in "five aspects in which they 
are falling behind," namely, as the scale of enterprise is 
enlarged, the leadership system is falling behind; when 
enterprise development requires that ideological, moral and 
technical qualities of the work force be raised continuously, 
the education of workers is falling behind; because important 
enterprise decisions also require taking into account the 
feelings of the masses and their benefits, democratic management 
is falling behind; while enterprise leadership needs to 
understand in a timely fashion the thoughts and feelings of the 
work force, the work in communicating with workers and labor 
welfare are falling behind; and finally when factory directors 
and party secretaries are busily engaged in production 
management, the task of studying and improving labor protection 
and welfare is falling behind. Many enterprise managers in Wuxi 
City generally agree that they are "too busy to cope" with four 
problem areas, namely, enterprise management, ideological 
education, technical training and solving issues of labor 
protection and welfare. It is urgently hoped that [rural 
enterprise labor unions] will effectively "assist" in the same 
way as labor unions in State-owned enterprises to organize the 
masses for self-management, to help the enterprise by exercising 
oversight, and to assist the enterprise leadership to carry out 
tasks which strengthen the enterprise's drive and competitive 
strength. According to a survey of over 2,000 rural industrial 
and commercial enterprises in the suburbs of Wuxi City, 98 
percent of the managers agreed that labor unions should quickly 
be established among the rural enterprises. 
  For rural enterprises to get on track with modernized 
management and socialized production and to more effectively 
engage in market competition, we will need to depend on the 
Party and Government to devise progressive, comprehensive and 
relevant policies and regulations; much work remains to be done 
by all parties, with labor unions helping to organize the work 
force and the laborers themselves relying on their own strength 
to make progress and at the same time to help promote progress 
in the rural enterprises. 
<H5>  3. Basis in Policy and Law for Establishing Rural Enterprise </H5>
Labor Unions 
  It has been exactly 10 years since China's first rural 
enterprise labor union was established in 1983. During the past 
10 years, the Party, Government and labor union organization 
have paid close attention to the growth of this new army of 
labor rank and file. In 1984, the All-China Labor Federation 
began to organize rural enterprise labor unions on a trial 
basis. In 1988, the CPC Central Committee Politburo Standing 
Committee, after discussion, approved in principle the "Basic 
Concept of Labor Union Reform" which states: "All rural 
enterprises which meet the required conditions should establish 
labor unions based on the principle of free will of the 
workers." In August that same year, document No. 17 (1988) of 
the CPC Central Committee Office of General Administration 
points out that with rural enterprises developing and 
strengthening on a daily basis, the trend to establish labor 
unions should be followed. In 1992, the "Labor Union Law of the 
People's Republic of China" was promulgated, which clearly 
specifies that: All workers whose main livelihood is based on 
wages received from rendering physical or mental labor in any 
enterprises, organizations or work units -- regardless of 
nationality, ethnicity, sex, occupation, religious belief or 
educational level -- shall have the right to legally organize 
and join labor unions. Not long ago, given the concern of leader 
cadres and comrades in the Central Government, responsible 
personnel of the All-China Labor Federation and the Agricultural 
Ministry, after discussions and coordination, reached agreement 
on the issue of rural enterprises establishing labor unions and 
made a number of joint recommendations in the minutes of the 
meeting. These recommendations provide the basis for political 
support, legal protection and implementing steps for rural 
enterprises to establish labor unions. 
  With support from party and government leadership and joint 
efforts of labor organizations at all levels, close to 20,000 
rural enterprises have established labor unions with a total 
membership approaching 3 million persons, while some 2 million 
persons are in the process of being unionized. Practically 
speaking, establishing labor unions in rural enterprises is 
beneficial in several areas: it strengthens party leadership of 
having rural enterprises to follow and fulfil in practice the 
labor class objectives; it strengthens ideological political 
work and technical job training to raise the quality of the work 
force; it stabilizes coordination of enterprise-labor relations 
to maintain the legitimate benefits of the work force; and it 
strengthens management, promotes development and improves 
economic benefits of the enterprises. 
<H5>  IV. Positively and Practically Carry Out the Work of </H5>
Establishing Rural Enterprise Labor Unions 
  Gradually establishing rural enterprises labor unions is a 
glorious mission which history has assigned to us. However, in 
establishing rural enterprise labor unions, certain concrete and 
practical conditions must also be met. These conditions include: 
the enterprise having a legal corporate status, a fixed 
production site, a certain scale of production, facilities as 
well as technical expertise, engaging in normal production with 
a stable work force and earning relatively good economic 
returns. Based on analysis of data, only 2 percent, or about 
400,000, of all rural enterprises at present meet all the 
conditions for establishing labor unions, and their work force 
totals approximately 20 million workers. These enterprises are 
mainly located along the southeastern coastal areas and in the 
large and medium-size cities and their environs, and most of 
these are collective enterprises operated by villages and 
townships. 
  From China's overall standpoint, establishing rural 
enterprise labor unions at present is still in an experimental 
stage and should be expanded in principle, but it cannot be done 
in one stroke. Rural enterprises in the coastal areas, being 
developed, ready and able to meet the requisite conditions, can 
gradually proceed on a trial basis; for rural enterprises in 
China's central area, labor union organizing work is only in the 
preliminary stages but can be expanded on an experimental basis; 
in the western area, however, the requisite conditions for 
establishing rural enterprise labor unions should strictly be 
observed; but all "foreign funded" rural enterprises, 
particularly the "three-sources combined" type, should speed up 
the establishment of labor unions. 
  Among the already established rural enterprise labor unions, 
we should focus on their special characteristics, concretely 
develop them and strive to raise their working standards. There 
are some commonalities between rural enterprise labor unions and 
their urban counterparts. The former should concentrate on 
learning from the rich experiences of the latter. At the same 
time, rural enterprises have their own special characteristics. 
They cannot copy or transfer wholesale the modus operandi of 
their urban counterparts; rather, by studying and learning from 
the work experience of their urban counterparts, rural 
enterprise labor unions should bravely explore, experiment, 
gradually shape and perfect the operational parameters of labor 
unions with special rural enterprise characteristics. Rural 
enterprises should view enterprise production and economic 
returns as an integral whole, and mobilize the work force to 
contribute to the various missions and tasks involved; carry out 
effective education to raise the quality of the work force; 
organize the laborers to participate in democratic management, 
and tap the strength of the masses to run a good enterprise; 
protect and maintain the legitimate benefits and interests of 
the work force by coordinating labor relations and stabilizing 
the labor rank and file; pay special attention to difficulties 
encountered by the workers, and assist in making and 
administering gradual improvements in labor conditions and 
worker welfare; perform more practical services for the workers; 
prepare and concretely develop cultural and physical programs to 
energize and enrich the workers' spiritual livelihood, etc.; and 
fully develop the special advantages of labor unions. 
  Establishing rural enterprise labor unions is a major task 
that requires an overall, political and mass-oriented focus, it 
absolutely should not be treated simply as an operational task. 
With leadership party and government support at all levels, we 
must probe deeply into the lower levels and investigate, study 
and constantly summarize experiences of our work in order to 
shape and perfect relevant policies and measures to promote 
healthy development in the work of establishing rural enterprise 
labor unions.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Jian (2621 0256) of the International Trade </F>
Research Institute, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation: "Problems in Building China's Infrastructure, Using 
Foreign Funds"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  I. Plans to develop China's infrastructure and basic </H5>
industries 
  Infrastructure chiefly refers to transportation and 
telecommunications facilities. Basic industries generally refers 
to the energy and vital raw materials industries. In the past 
few years, the Chinese Government has given much attention to 
adjusting the industrial mix and speeding up construction of the 
infrastructure and basic industries. With the exception of the 
steel and nonferrous metals industries, where the pace has 
lagged behind a bit, the growth rate for infrastructure and 
investment in renewal of the transportation, posts and 
telecommunications, and energy industries has been as high as or 
higher than the growth rate of fixed capital investment 
throughout society for the same period. A group of large scale 
infrastructure and basic industry key projects has been 
established and put into production. The posts and 
telecommunications industry has developed the most rapidly. Over 
the past five years the growth rate for infrastructure 
construction and investment in technological transformation has 
averaged over 40 percent annually, and reached as high as 83 
percent in 1992. 
  Despite the great achievements attained in building the 
infrastructure and basic industries, it is far from what is 
required for national economic development. The elasticity 
coefficients (which is their growth rate compared to the growth 
rate of the domestic economy) of railway transportation, energy 
resources, and steel production have been quite low in recent 
years, and moreover are in a declining trend. 
  Since 1992, with accelerated economic growth, the 
restrictive 
"bottle necks" of the infrastructure and basic industries have 
become increasingly prominent. At present, the transportation 
capabilities of principal railway lines are saturated, their 
goods transport volume capable of fulfilling only 60-70 percent 
of demand. Among these, such as the Beijing-Guangzhou and 
Beijing-Shanghai lines can fulfill only about 40 percent. Most 
of the highways are of a low level and in poor condition, with 
frequent traffic jams. In the major coastal ports, the ratio of 
ships in operation to ships awaiting operation is more than 
1:1.2. Energy tends to be in short supply, and in some areas, 
limits on electrical supplies and the occurrence of power 
outages are increasing. There is a strong demand for major 
production materials such as steel, with declining reserves and 
sharp price rises. Inadequate transport capacity and shortages 
of energy sources and raw materials has in some areas directly 
affected agricultural and industrial production and foreign 
trade and exports. It has also affected in differing degrees the 
confidence of potential foreign investors. 
  In order to improve the investment environment, and 
guarantee 
the lasting, stable, and coordinated development of the national 
economy, the state's long term focus is accelerating building of 
the infrastructure in areas such as transportation, energy, and 
basic industries. According to documents provided by state 
industrial planning departments, during the period of the Eighth 
Five-year Plan, the developmental plans for transportation, 
telecommunications, energy, and important raw materials 
industries and projects arranged by the central government are, 
in outline: 
  Railways: Build up the important trunk lines: the 
Beijing to Jiujiang line, the Baozhong line, the 
Lanzhou-Xinjiang multiple track line, the Houyue line, the 
Zhejiang to Jiangxi multiple track line, and the Nanning to 
Baise segment of the Nanning to Kunming line. Complete the 
project of expanding the capacity of the Wuchang to Guangzhou 
segment of the Beijing to Guangzhou line and the Daqing line 
supporting project. Speed up the second coal transportation 
channel from Shensuo to Huangye port, aiming for overall 
completion during the Ninth Five-year Plan. Plans call for 
construction of 6,600 km of new lines, 4,100 km of multiple 
lines, and 5,600 km of electrification replacement. 
  Ports, highways: Accelerate building the first 
phase of the Huangye port coal wharf project, the fourth phase 
of the Qinhuangdao port coal wharf project, the eastern China 
and southern China coal transfer bases, and a group of container 
wharfs in Dalian, Tianjin, Beilun and Yantian. Accelerate 
construction of the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Hangzhou, 
Jinan-Qingdao, Chengdu-Chongqing and Beijing-Shenzhen freeways 
and roads especially motor vehicles. The State plans to 
construct 5,400 km of new freeways and first and second class 
roads especially for motor vehicles, and build 90,000 km of new 
roads. 
  Telecommunications: Construct inter-provincial and 
regional optical fiber communications cables between 
Xian-Chengdu, Beijing-Shenyang-Haerbin, and 
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou. Plans are to increase the nation's 
telephone switchboard capacity to 18 million. 
  Coal: Stress construction of large scale coal 
mines in Shenfu, Zhungeer, Yimin, Yunji, Lianhuai, etc. Make a 
major effort to remake old mines in eastern China, and continue 
to encourage development of local mines. Plans call for raw coal 
output to increase to 1.25 billion tons in 1995. 
  Electric power: Stress construction of such power 
plants as Shanxi Baoji, Henan Qinbei and Sanxi Yangcheng, etc., 
speed up progress of building hydropower station in Ertan, 
Yantan, Tianshenqiao, Shuikou, Manwan, Lijiaxia and Wuqiangxi, 
etc. Complete preparations for the primary stages of the Three 
Gorges Project. Meanwhile, vigorously develop nuclear power. 
The state plans to add 64 million KW of power generators 
throughout China. Electric energy production by 1995 will be 
increased to 920 billion KW hour. 
  Petroleum: Continue prospecting and exploiting oil 
fields in eastern China, and stabilize current output. Try to 
increase prospecting for oil reserves in western China, and 
vigorously exploit natural gas and oil and gas fields offshore. 
Study, develop, and apply energy saving technology. It is 
planned that in 1995, crude oil output will reach about 150 
million tons. 
  Steel: Stress improving quality of products, and 
increasing products which are in shortage. Try to increase 
substantially the proportion of continuous casting and sheet and 
tube materials. Plans call for an output of steel to increase to 
88 million tons in 1995. 
  The fixed asset investment scale for the whole of society 
during the Eighth Five-year Plan is 3,400 billion yuan 
(calculated according to the fixed price for 1990, the same 
below). Of this, the plan for state-owned units calls for 1,870 
billion yuan in infrastructure construction and renewal 
investment. According to the state plan and current 
developmental trends, investment in infrastructure, basic 
industries and renewal will be about 900 to 1000 billion yuan 
during the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. It has already 
achieved 335 billion yuan in 1991 and 1992, so the investment in 
1993 and 1994 would be about 200 billion yuan per year. 
<H5>  II. Huge potential for foreign investment in infrastructure </H5>
  Investment in construction of the infrastructure and basic 
industries is on a large scale, and has long term returns. It 
used to be state investment for the most part, but since the 
implementation of opening and reform, localities, departments, 
and enterprises are increasingly gaining the right to control 
their own economic activities, while the market system's role in 
economic growth and resource allocation is becoming increasingly 
obvious. In recent years, society's fixed asset investment has 
tended to be multi-channel, and so has investment in 
infrastructure and basic industries. At present, the major 
investment sources are: 
  1. State budgeted domestic capital and capital for 
construction of special projects. By this is meant the state 
budget, local finances, allocations from departments in charge 
and from the national specialized investment corporations or 
basic construction loans extended to construction units by 
entrusted banks, funds allocated to enterprise units for 
replacement, and special construction funds collected by 
railway, highway, and energy departments at a certain rate. In 
1990, state budgeted investment dropped to 40 percent in railway 
and coal departments, while it was about 10 percent in 
transport, post and telecommunications, petroleum, and electric 
power departments, and in steel industry departments, it dropped 
below 7 percent. 
  2. Domestic loans. These are loans allocated from banks' own 
capital or deposits taken in from enterprises and institutes, 
loans arranged as capital for localities' special projects, key 
enterprise bonds and construction bonds, etc., that a bank 
issues when acting as the agent of the State specialized 
investment corporation. In 1990, bank loan investment in the 
posts and telecommunications, civil aviation, and steel sectors 
constituted only 40 to 50 percent of their infrastructure and 
renewal investment, while in other sectors, bank loans for the 
infrastructure was about 20 percent. 
  3. Self-collected capital. With the relaxing of prices, some 
infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, posts and 
telecommunications, civil aviation, electricity, steel, etc., 
have improved their economic efficiency and strengthened 
self-renewal and self-development abilities. Their 
self-collected capital has been increasingly rising. In such 
sectors as railways and electric power, self-collected capital 
has constituted more than 30 percent of the investment in 
infrastructure and renewal. 
  4. Exploitation of foreign capital. This includes foreign 
loans, invested capital from foreign investment enterprises, 
donations from overseas, etc. At the outset of reform and 
opening, foreign capital imported for construction of 
infrastructure and basic industries consisted chiefly of loans 
from foreign governments and international financial 
organizations. Direct foreign investment was very cautious, 
limited only to cooperative prospecting and exploitation of 
offshore oil and gas fields. In the middle and late eighties, 
the government began to encourage foreign investments in some 
energy projects and in freeway, port and wharf construction. 
Some coastline provinces and cities made a series of agreements 
on a group of joint venture projects for constructing electric 
power mill, highways and railways. Guangdong's Pingnan Railway 
was the first joint venture joint stock railway enterprise. 
Shenzhen's airport and port were both built with foreign 
capital. The key national mainland-Hong Kong joint venture 
construction project, the Guangdong Dayawan Power Station has 
gone into connection and started production. By the end of 1992, 
there were 28 electrical power stations with foreign investment, 
with a total capacity of 7.87 million KW. Six coastline oil 
fields have gone into production, with a yearly output of more 
than 3 million tons. Hainan is also leasing 30 square km of land 
in Yanggugao to the Japanese Xiongguzu [phonetic] (Hong Kong) 
Company, Ltd., for 70 years, for developments which will 
encompass wharf, road, and power station construction through 
the province. 
  Statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation show that since 1989, all figures and amount of 
money involved in agreements on use of foreign capital increases 
in differing degrees in the petroleum, coal, and transportation 
sectors. 
  The rapid rise in the use of foreign capital in the 
infrastructure and basic industry demonstrates that foreign 
businesspersons have complete confidence in China's economic 
development and the future of value addition in the 
infrastructure sector. However, infrastructure and basic 
industry do not constitute a large share of total amount of 
foreign capital utilized to date. The major existing problems on 
China's part are: insufficient experience; we still have not 
followed up with some relevant laws, regulations, and supporting 
management measures; and foreign business persons still have 
misgivings about committing long term investment on the Chinese 
mainland. 
  In recent years, the major developed nations in the West 
have 
suffered from a continuously slumping economy, their industrial 
mix is facing readjustment, and must find a market for their 
massive capital and investment-type goods. China's 
infrastructure construction is no doubt a potential market, so 
has a definite attraction for foreign capital. We should 
maintain stability in our economy, politics, and society, 
enlarge our measures for opening to the outside, readjust our 
relevant policies, attract more investment, and speed up 
development of the infrastructure. 
<H5>  III. Relevant encouraging policies and measures </H5>
  The Chinese Government will in the future adopt the 
following 
policies and measures to speed up construction of the 
infrastructure: 
  First, while controlling the scale of fixed asset investment 
in society, increase the rate of investment in infrastructure 
construction. In the last three years of the Eighth Five-year 
Plan, the state will strictly control general projects of the 
processing industries and will possibly increase investment in 
key construction projects in transportation, telecommunications, 
and energy. In the central government's investment in 1993, 70.6 
percent went into construction in transportation, 
telecommunications, energy and the raw materials industry, an 
increase of 5.9 percent over the year before. 
  Second, speed up price reforms in energy and transportation, 
to strengthen the ability of the infrastructure and basic 
industry sectors to raise their own funds. The State will 
gradually raise the level of shipping fees collected by railways 
and ports, bringing them near or up to the level of cost plus 
average profits. As soon as possible, merge the plan prices and 
market prices in the crude oil and electric power sectors. 
Change the state's unified price fixed in basic industry sectors 
to differing levels of price-setting control, giving localities 
a certain amount of leeway in their price setting rights. Let 
localities set prices for transport and shipping facilities 
which they operate. 
  Third, using the market operations system, encourage 
localities, departments, and enterprises to invest in 
infrastructure construction. With a uniform national plan and 
uniform technical standards for highway construction, localities 
will be permitted to build their individual sections. In joint 
venture infrastructure projects, the central government, 
localities, and enterprises will operate on the principle of 
"sharing profits and risk" and "the investors will take the 
profits." 
  Fourth, appropriately enhance the level of collections in 
special construction funds or attached fees in railways, 
highways, shipping, and civil aviation, etc., and add special 
construction funds for coal, electricity, and oil, etc., as well 
as implementing intensive management of construction funds 
collected, charging by use, with rolling development. 
  Fifth, expand the scale of medium and long term bank loans 
for construction in transportation and energy. Authorize fiscal 
rights for some large-scale transportation enterprises and 
enterprise groups. As appropriate, issue more construction 
bonds. With the establishment of a system of social insurance, 
bank deposits of all types will grow steadily. The state should 
attempt to apply these sums of capital to profitable key 
construction projects. 
  Sixth, enthusiastically absorb and exploit foreign capital. 
In April 1991, the National Congress passed the "Tax Laws for 
Profits of Foreign Capital Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises." 
In June 1991 the State Council issued detailed implementation 
regulations and other state laws and legal regulations. These 
stipulate that foreign commercial interests can obtain favorable 
treatment if they invest in the infrastructure and basic 
industries, as follows: 
  Foreign commercial investment in urban energy, 
transportation, and port construction in older cities in coastal 
economic development zones, special economic zones, or economic 
and technological development zones. Foreign commercial 
investors in the airport, port, railway, highway, and electrical 
power stations in the Shanghai Pudong New District will be 
charged at a 15 percent tax rate on their enterprises' profits. 
  Joint venture enterprises engaged in port and wharf 
construction, and foreign enterprises investing in such 
infrastructure facilities as airports, ports, wharves, railways, 
highways, electric stations, coal mines, and hydropower, etc., 
in the Hainan Special Zone, and which have been in operation for 
more than 15 years', can receive tax relief after making 
application and with the approval by local tax organs. This will 
be relief from the first five years' taxes starting with the 
first year in which the enterprise earns a profit; then, the 
enterprises will pay only one-half of the taxes on their profits 
for the sixth to tenth years. 
  Give relief to customs duty and united industrial and 
commercial tax for importing machines, equipments and raw 
materials used for developing energy, railway, highway, port, 
etc. of fundamental construction by means of using foreign 
capital. 
  The fourth session of inviting tenders for oil drilling off 
the East China coast lasted one year, and was very successful. 
The areas contracted for and agreed to occupy 55 percent of the 
total area for which tenders were invited. The initial risk 
investment in the prospecting stage for foreign partners is 
estimated at more than US$240 million. The biggest joint venture 
project in the Shenzhen SEZ is the Hong Kong Heji Huangpu Ltd. 
Corporation's construction and operation of the Yantian 
International container wharf. The contract was signed during a 
ceremony on 5 October 1992 in Beijing. This project has a term 
of cooperation of 50 years, with registered capital of HK$1.2 
billion. The estimated total investment on the project will be 
over RMB5 billion yuan. 
  Based on what is needed to speed up development of the 
national economy and perfect the industrial mix, during the 
Eighth and Ninth Five-year Plans, China will continue to expand 
the scale of its importation and use of foreign capital in 
construction of the infrastructure and basic industries. Major 
measures currently pending or in operation are: 
  First, foreign business will be allowed to contract for 
construction of railways, highways, ports, airport lounges, 
electric power stations, etc. In keeping with international 
practice, after a project is completed, it will be managed and 
operated by foreign businesses for about 15 years, while the 
Chinese side collects taxes from it. When the tern of a 
contract has expired, the entire project will revert to the 
Chinese side. 
  Second, in order to encourage foreign business investment in 
building the infrastructure, other investment areas related to 
projects will be opened up for foreign business investors. For 
example, those who invest in highway and railway construction 
may operate highway and railway lines, and engage in retailing, 
real estate, and advertising along railways or highways. Foreign 
business persons who invest in port construction will be 
permitted to operate as transport and shipping agents, commodity 
agents, etc. 
  Third, 12 open regions, including the Talimu basin, will 
invite prospecting and exploitation by foreign oil companies. It 
is reported that there is as much as 8.2 billion tons in oil 
reserves in these 12 regions, and as much as 250 million cubic 
meters in natural gas reserves. So far, 68 enterprises from 17 
countries, including 24 U.S. enterprises, have shown interest in 
investing in exploitation of the Talimu basin oil field. 
  Fourth, the steel industry plans to implement a joint stock 
system in some key enterprises through the issuance of B-type 
stocks overseas, or improve the level of incentives to attract 
even more foreign capital in the form of foreign governmental 
loans, export loans, etc., to launch enterprise technology 
renewal. Some joint venture projects that fall in the category 
of important raw materials, and that import advanced technology 
will be permitted to market their products chiefly in the 
domestic market. 
  Accelerated construction of the infrastructure and basic 
industries will definitely result in greatly increased imports 
of related technology, equipment, and materials. China's market 
will open with further reform of the foreign trade and commerce 
system, as we try to get closer to the international regulations 
for managing import and export trade and importing foreign 
capital. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
has made public a list of 210 large and important technical 
projects that China will import between 1993 and 2000, with a 
gross value of close to US$30 billion. Of these, 102 projects 
are in energy, transportation, civil aviation, or posts and 
telecommunications. The forecast is that, in the future, 
overseas investors will have more cooperation and trade 
opportunities in these areas.

<H5>  2. Bilateral economic and technological cooperation situation </H5>
  1) Chinese joint venture enterprises in Indonesia. 
  Some 84 Sino-Indonesian joint ventures have been set up in 
Indonesia since reestablishment of relations which have the 
approval of Indonesia's Investment Committee or of China's 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
[MOFERT--organization name as published], of which, 23 have been 
approved by the latter organization and officially have informed 
our office; seven have been approved by the former organization 
and officially have informed our office. Chinese investment 
agreements approved by MOFERT amount to $11.0025 million. The 
primary means of Chinese investment is by introducing equipment, 
manufacturing technology, set up and debugging, and conducting 
training, which account for approximately 90 percent of all 
Chinese investment agreements. Major projects include textiles, 
glass, watches, electricity, chemical industry machinery, 
universal machinery manufacture, activated charcoal, printing 
ink, pharmaceuticals, fishing, and technical consulting. 
  2) Engineering contracts, and technology and labor export 
cooperation. 
  Between January and June 1993 China signed Indonesian 
engineering contracts and labor cooperation contracts at $41.52 
million, up 640 percent over the same period in 1992, of which, 
the former accounted for $29.89 million, up 1014 percent over 
the same period in 1992, and the latter for $1.63 million, up 20 
percent over the same period in 1992. Completed projects and 
projects being completed include: a 35,000-ton grade oceanic 
tanker and a 5 x 35,000 kilowatt thermal power plant unit. Work 
continues on complete alkalization equipment, cooperative 
gulch-gold mining, coal mine exploration and design, hot sheet 
steel plant construction and electrical transmission projects. 
In 1993 two contracts were signed for complete power generation 
equipment alone. One is a 2 x 25,000 kilowatt t hermal power 
plant unit. The other is China's largest thermal power plant 
unit, a 2 x 200,000 kilowatt project. The latter project alone 
is worth nearly $300 million, including plant selection and 
design, construction, equipment supply, unit set up , debugging 
and operation training. Only such a unified group of economic 
and technological cooperation projects with elect 
rico-mechanical equipment exports can better motivate and 
promote swifter developments in Sino-Indonesian bilateral 
economic cooperation to improve and spur on political and 
diplomatic relationships between the two countries. 
<H5>  3. Future outlook and growth </H5>
  According to the ranking of countries in China's import and 
export trade totals, Indonesia at present is in 14th place. In 
the three years since reestablishment of relations, it is also 
the country with the largest import expor t trade deficit with 
China. However, because the strong mutual dependence between the 
import and export commodities of both countries, we could say 
that Indonesia will be a large potential market for China's 
product exports, especially electrico-mechanical products and 
complete equipment exports. It should be a key point in our 
strategy to promote market diversification . Towards this end I 
recommend using China's strength in producing 
electric-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment 
combined with China's contract engineering in Indonesia to 
promote future growth in Sino-Indonesian economic and trade 
relations. It is important that the following work be done well: 
  1. Stress developing China's strengths in the 
industries of electric-mechanical products and complete sets of 
equipment, and participate in the transformation of Indonesia's 
production enterprises. 
  At present Indonesia's major economic and trade partners are 
Japan, the United States, the EC, the ROK, Taiwan and Singapore 
and other ASEAN countries (regions). To develop its economic 
might swiftly, while actively developing its import and export 
trade, Indonesia tends towards more preferential conditions to 
attract overseas clients and foreign funds to open domestic 
joint ventures and thereby accelerate expansion and strenthening 
of economic and technological cooperation with various countries 
and regions of the world. According to statistics from the 
Indonesian Investment Coordination Council, as of the 31 August 
1993, the accumulated global investment in Indonesia was $69.66 
billion. The major investment industries are the chemical (19.6 
percent), tourism (10.7 percent) and mining (9.3 percent) along 
with machinery manufacturing, papermaking and textiles. The 
aforementioned countries have been in the Indonesian market a 
relatively long time and their actual strength is far greater 
than China's. Regarding high class consumer goods in the 
Indones ian consumer market, their products are high grade, good 
quality, strongly functional, high priced and delivered on time. 
The Indonesian light and textile industries have grown to a 
certain international level with their own characteristics. 
However, its electro-mechanical industry is still in the infant 
stage; the country's largest machinery manufacturing plant only 
corresponds to a medium-sized Chinese one. The majority mainly 
do repairs. A few factories can produce some parts and small 
volumes of small and medium-sized mechanical equipment. The 
country has no complete electro-mechanical production system. 
There still is no production of power plant equipment. Thus we 
should stress importing complete medium and small capacity 
thermal and hydropower generators, electric transformer 
equipment, metallurgy equipment, mining equipment, a variety of 
construction machinery, petrochemical and chemical industry 
equipment, agricultural machinery, complete cement production 
equipment, plus technology for computer-controlled system 
software. China's greatest strength in opening and developing 
Indonesia's markets is in equipment and technology to satisfy 
the needs of Indonesia's production enterprises and extended 
reproduction therein. 
  2. The effective way to develop Indonesia's industrial 
product market should be active encouragement an d organization 
of projects uniting economic and technological cooperation to 
import and export trade. 
  Catering to the needs of the Indonesian Government, support 
Chinese enterprises under contract work in Indonesia through 
Indonesian economic cooperative projects to spur on exports of 
Chinese electro-mechanical products and complete sets of 
equipment or use the sup eriority of both exports to promote 
bilateral economic and technological cooperation. This would 
both improve the economic results of China's export enterprises 
and earn us a lot of foreign exchange. Such forms of mutual 
bi-directional investment cooperation also will improve friendly 
relations with both countries. Given the shortage of Indonesian 
funds, China should appropriately assemble some limited fiscal 
power suited to Indonesia's peculiar situation and provide 
necessary export loans to expand exports of complete sets of 
electro-mechanical products. 
  3. To open the Indonesian market we must take note of 
the form of China's model projects in Indonesia. 
  China severed relations with Indonesia for 23 years for 
various reasons, making present Indonesia still harbor 
misgivings regarding China. For example, Indonesia granted birth 
certificates to people from 45 countries and regions, excluding 
China. Although Indonesia's industrial and commercial world 
understands China, not all understand China's complete 
electro-mechanical equipment. Likewise they have many 
misgivings, thus it is extremely important that we set up 
several successful large-scale complete "model" projects in 
Indonesia. Provided we all give priority to this matter at home 
and abroad, it will have results very quickly. Recently we 
coordinated with t hose at home and abroad to bring closer 
bilateral relations through construction of an irrigation 
project in Indonesia, promoting future bilateral cooperation in 
broader areas. 
  4. Squarely face China's export product problems. 
  The old issue of the quality of China's export products, 
which is difficult to resolve, is the fundamental issue for 
entering the Indonesian market. The competitiveness of 
electro-mechanical product quality lies in their superior 
performance, ease of operation and work safety. At least we must 
ensure that China's products are about the same as those of the 
advanced countries of Europe and the United States. Second is 
establishing product sales networks and after-sale service 
networks, including parts and components and repair networks. 
Finally, we must ensure that China's export products to 
Indonesia do not compete for sales at rolled back and lower 
prices. This would both confuse opening up the Indonesian market 
and shatter the development base for enterprises to be 
independent. Therefore, domestically, we must enhance the 
restraint and control mechanisms over export products through 
the chambers of commerce of various industries. At the same 
time, mesh with the coordinated management of overseas 
economic commerical attaches, and really consolidate and further 
develop the Indonesian markets already opened. 
  5. Establish a project contract model suited to 
Indonesia. 
  This contract model mainly incl udes the following: 
  1) Foreign contract projects themselves are a complex system 
of projects. This is the same in every country. Basically they 
involve two major processes: the process from bidding, 
negotiations, study, economic and technolgical feasibility draft 
approval to signing a contract; and the process from project 
technical design, site selection and design approval, 
construction, equipment manufacture, check and acceptance, 
transport, assembly, debugging to going into commercial 
operation. 
  2) Indonesian contract projects must correctly squarely face 
special human relations and the phenomenon that "money opens 
doors" which determine relations between Indonesian proprietors 
and Chinese enterprises. We must firmly uphold the cooperative 
division of labor principle that proprietors are responsible for 
anything related to Indonesian work and conditions outside of 
construction while anything related to China's relevant domestic 
procedures and work is the responsibility of the Chinese 
contractor. 
  3) Indonesian contract projects must firmly uphold the 
overall responsibility of the Chinese side. We must divide labor 
with Indonesia. The Chinese side should undertake responsibility 
for technical guidance on projects in Indonesia. This is because 
Indonesia still is now an economically undeveloped large country 
with many people and rather high unemployment. We only arrived 
at this rather appropriate solution after 1992 when the 
Indonesian Government built a five unit 35,000 kilowatt 
coal-burning electrical power plant project which caused a 
"labor wave." 
  China and Indonesia have a close geographical location. 
Economic and trade dependence is strong. In the more than three 
years since relations were re-established on the basis of 
voluntary equality and mutual benefit, the developing bilateral 
economic and trade cooperative relationship fully accords with 
the desires and basic interests of the people of both countries. 
Looking to the future full of confidence, we should work harder 
and strive to make greater developments in Sino-Indonesian trade 
and economic and technological cooperation in 1994.

professor at Shanghai Finance U's Asian Economics Studies 
Institute: "Heroes From All Walks of Life Are Converging on 
Wuhan"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: In February 1994, the New 
World Group, one of Hong Kong's 10 major [financial] 
consortiums, announced in Wuhan that it would invest 10 billion 
RMB in Wuhan within the next three to five years, with its 
investment to top 24 billion RMB by the year 2004. 
  In 1993 alone, the New World Group invested over 2 billion 
RMB in Wuhan, building more than 20 projects, including large 
ones, such as the Guobao Tower, the Taipei Hotel, the Dong-Xi Hu 
Development Zone, the Kai He Airport, and a second bridge over 
the Chang Jiang. 
  The New World Group is investing in the first half of 1994 
in 
project starts in Wuhan, such as the Xin Cheng Prototype Zone, 
occupying 137 mu of land, with a construction area of 260,000 sq 
m; the large-scale construction of a small housing district in 
the Dong-Xi Hu Zone; and over 80 km of road-building around 
Wuhan. The New World Group has indicated that by the end 
of 1994, 1.5-2 billion RMB of funds will be in place, and that 
it will be using the income profits and capital plus interest 
from its projects already in operation for expanded 
investment. 
  Meanwhile, another Hong Kong consortium, the Kowloon 
Warehouse Group, has confirmed that it is going all out to 
develop 27 sq km of land in Yangluo, Wuhan, mainly to build a 
transshipment center with a handling capacity of 1.5 million 
standard containers a year, and a 3.6-million-ton bulk cargo 
dock, to develop businesses, such as through Chang Jiang-sea 
transport, railways, waterways, highways, through air transport, 
and duty-free entrepot trade. In 1994, the Yangluo Container 
Transshipment Center project planned by this group for Wuhan is 
already under construction. 
<H5>  Hung Ta Buys Into the "No 2 Printing and Dyeing Mill," </H5>
Turning Losses Into Profits 
  In June 1992, Hong Kong's Hung Ta Corporation bought 51 
percent of the shares in one of Wuhan's big losers--the Wuhan No 
2 Printing and Dyeing Mill, organizing in holding company form 
with "No 2" a joint venture, the "Wuhan Rongze Printing and 
Dyeing Industrial Corp Ltd." As Hong Kong investment 
controlled over one-half of its shares, "Rongze" set a precedent 
to become China's first large or midsize state enterprise to be 
share-controlled and managed by a Hong Kong partner. The 
original "No 2's" internal mechanisms were grafted and upgraded 
through thorough remolding. Before "No 2" became a joint 
venture, it had liabilities of nearly 90 million RMB, or 2.7 
times its assets. But once "Rongze" had been in operation for 
a year and a half, conditions had changed sharply with its daily 
output up from 60,000 yards to 2.3 million yards, and its top 
quality rate up from 60-70 percent to over 95 percent. While it 
had sustained annual losses exceeding 10 million RMB before it 
became a joint venture, it has earned profits topping 10 million 
RMB a year since. By the end of 1993, "Rongze" had an output 
value of 150 million RMB, with export earnings of $15 million. 
  The enormous difference between "No 2" and "Rongze" has had 
a 
sharp impact in Chinese business and economics circles. Many 
hold that as introducing foreign investment alone cannot 
solve the "serious and longstanding" problems involved in 
converting the operating forces of state enterprises, the 
effective way to do so is to combine the introduction of foreign 
investment with the transformation of enterprise property rights 
relations and management patterns, to genuinely adapt 
enterprise operations to market economy needs. 
<H5>  The Business Iron Triangle's Largest-Scale Investment Site </H5>
  As a "nine-province thoroughfare," Wuhan has always been 
China's communications hub and commercial metropolis. The 
development of Shanghai's Pudong and the Chang Jiang economic 
strip have made Wuhan's key status even more evident. Hong Kong 
firms favor Wuhan precisely because of its exceptional economic 
and geographic advantages. Hong Kong's New World Group has 
actually invested more than 2 billion RMB in Wuhan, which is the 
largest-scale investment site of this group's 
"Guangzhou-Shanghai-Wuhan" business "iron triangle" construct. 
The group's board chairman, Dr. Cheng Yu-T'ung [6774 5940 
1749], sees Wuhan as uniquely advantaged, with 
water-transport advantages, a rich industrial base, and a host 
of S&amp;T talent. 
<H5>  Efforts To Turn Wuhan Into a Container Center </H5>
  Mr. Li Wei-jen [2621 0787 0088], vice president and CEO 
of the Kowloon Warehouse Group, makes his economic "iron 
triangle" concept Shanghai-Wuhan-Hong Kong. Li Wei-jen 
emphasizes that as Wuhan is located in inland China, linked to 
Beijing in the north, Guangzhou in the south, Chongqing in the 
west, and Shanghai in the east, putting it at the center of a 
geographic "cross," investment in Wuhan means that a slight move 
in one part may affect the situation as a whole, which will be 
bound to earn higher investment returns. 
  Another outstanding investment decision of these two Hong 
Kong groups is to go all out to build infrastructures. The 
Kowloon Warehouse Group holds that to develop central 
China, the key matter is to open up its arteries to achieve the 
greatest possible flow of goods. Wuhan needs to build a set 
of modern transportation, communications, and management 
systems. On these grounds, this group has invested billions of 
Hong Kong dollars to implement a development plan for a 
transportation system stretching from southern China's coastal 
cities to the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang in central 
China. This transportation system will be linked to the 
Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Kowloon railways, turning China's 
inland industrial zone into an interior port, and turning Wuhan 
into a a large container transshipment center, so that it can 
function as an inland economic center. 
<H5>  Wu Kuang-cheng Holds That Wuhan Is a Strategic Place </H5>
  Mr. Wu Kuang-cheng [0702 0342 2973], board chairman of 
the Kowloon Warehouse Group, holds that: Wuhan is the Chang 
Jiang's key point, which can spur the economic development of 
the coastal zone. Once we acknowledge that Wuhan is a 
strategic economic-development place, we should establish the 
concept of Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan as an 
economic axis, with all investment in this axis by the Kowloon 
Warehouse Group directly or indirectly increasing the value of 
Hong Kong. Mr. Cheng Chia-chun [6774 1367 4783], 
president of the New World Group, also emphasizes that 
development of Wuhan needs to be focused on infrastructures, 
such as transportation and energy, instead of simply on 
bubble-economy fields, such as real estate. This group has 
signed contracts for projects in Wuhan, such as communications 
and transportation, industrial zone development, housing 
construction, highways, and airports, as well as the upgrading 
of aging state enterprises. 
<H5>  The U.S. Morgan Corporation Also Comes To Invest </H5>
  With publicity and promotion by Hong Kong consortiums, 26 
famous consortiums from throughout the world, such as the U.S. 
Morgan Consortium, have also come to investigate Wuhan. So it 
can be visualized that Wuhan will very quickly become a foreign 
investment and economic development hot spot.

Important Route To Raising Women's Status in Society: Interview 
With State Statistical Bureau, Social Department Director Wu Jun 
(0702 6511)"] 
  [Text] In September 1995, the United Nations 4th World 
Women's Congress will be held at Beijing -- the largest 
international conference to take place in China since the birth 
of the People's Republic. At that time, 15,000 representatives 
of United Nations member states will gather in Beijing to 
discuss issues of women in the world. One-half of the human race 
being female, issues of women are relevant to the development of 
human kind. Not long ago, this reporter called on the State 
Statistical Bureau's Social Department director Ms. Wu Jun, who 
is a member of the propaganda subcommittee of the China 
Organizing Committee for the 4th World Women's Congress. 
  [Reporter] In July 1985, the 3d World Women's Congress held 
in Nairobi, Kenya, adopted the "Nairobi Forward Strategy for 
Raising the Status of Women by the Year 2000." May I ask what is 
the current status of women in China? 
  [Wu] At present, with respect to employment of women in 
China, it can be said that the number of women employed is 
rising rapidly, but their status within the occupational 
structure is improving slowly; that basic education is rapidly 
reaching more women, but the rate of women graduating from 
higher education is slow; that traditional concepts still to a 
considerable degree hamper development of women's self esteem 
and competitiveness; and that discrimination in the society 
against women still exists and women do not enjoy equal 
educational and employment opportunities. 
  [Reporter] What are the results of China's effort to raise 
the status of women? 
  [Wu] China is one of the countries that endorsed the 
"Nairobi 
Strategy." The Chinese government has historically emphasized 
the importance of raising the social status of women. In the 
current waves of reform and opening, women in China are marching 
smartly forward in the society, and this can be seen in terms of 
the following: 
  First, the number of women employed is increasing rapidly. 
Reform and opening have created a favorable societal environment 
for women to play their role. In 1990, of the total 647,240,000 
persons employed in China, 291,010,000 were females, an increase 
of 27.7 percent over the 1982 figure. In this same time period, 
the number of males employed increased by 21.3 percent. In 1990, 
the number of females employed constituted 44.96 percent of the 
total employed population, an increase of 1.27 percentage points 
over 1982. 
  Second, channels of employment for women are widening. In 
the 
last few years, women's employment in the various trades and 
occupations has shown considerable changes. The number of 
females employed in financial and insurance trades has increased 
1.6-fold, commercial food service and supply trades 79.6 
percent, offices and organizations 78.6 percent, and public 
health and welfare trades 42.7 percent. Other than 
transportation, telecommunications, construction and real estate 
services, where increases in the number of males employed are 
greater, in all other trades and occupations, the rate of 
increase of females employed is faster than males. In health and 
welfare occupations, the rate of increase in employment of 
females is much greater than males. 
  Third, the cultural background of women been raised, while 
their status within the occupational structure continues to 
improve. In 1990, the number of women with junior high, high 
school and college education increased 56.98 percent, 37.6 
percent and 2.08-fold respectively over comparable figures in 
1982. The fact that women's cultural and educational level is 
rising has contributed to improved employment status of women. 
  [Reporter] What do you consider to be the most pressing 
issues for women in China today? 
  [Wu] There are several: Women still have more difficulties 
seeking employment and, for college-educated women, obtaining 
work assignments matched to their training; in terms of 
improving their status within the occupational structure, women 
still tend to hold lower grade jobs; in rural areas, women face 
greater difficulties moving into other non-agricultural fields; 
and in the work force, a relatively higher proportion of females 
employed are of the younger age groups. 
  In education of women, both their numbers and rate of 
enrollment in school are low among females of school age in 
rural areas; overall, among the employed, the higher that 
educational or technical background required in certain 
occupations, the lower the proportion of women represented 
therein. 
  [Reporter] To realize the "Nairobi Strategy" stated goal 
that 
"for women to participate in development, there must be 
realistic assurances that women and men can participate equally 
in formulating plans for national economical and social 
development, and take part concretely in developmental 
activities," what further steps should China undertake to help 
implement this goal? 
  [Wu] To begin with, first we should further intensify reform 
and liberate and develop our productive capacity. Only through 
deepening reform, continually liberating and developing our 
productive capacity, raising the automation, technological and 
knowledge levels in our work while lessening the degree of 
direct reliance on man's physical labor in the production 
process, can we further widen the channels of employment for 
women. We must at the same time vigorously develop the tertiary 
industries. 
  Second, we need to raise the levels of socialization, 
mechanization and automation in household chores and labor. 
  Third, we should vigorously develop education. With respect 
to education for females, we should strive for a unified 
approach to making basic education available to all women as 
well as raising the educational level of all women. In 1990, 
close to one-third of the females age 15 and over were 
illiterate or semi-literate; while only 2.3 percent of women in 
ages 20-24 had a college education. Therefore, on the one hand, 
we should concentrate on eliminating illiteracy among women, at 
the same time, we must also emphasize promoting higher education 
for women. 
  Fourth, we should ensure that in the process of developing 
the socialist spirit and culture, concrete efforts are made to 
promoting respect for women and supporting and protecting 
benefits for women through widespread propaganda and creating an 
atmosphere conducive to realistically carrying out our tasks.

<F P=106> [Report by Jin Guozheng (6855 0948 2398): "Communique Issued </F>
by Ministry of Labor and State Statistics Bureau on Development 
of Labor Industry in 1993"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Labor 
and the State Statistics Bureau jointly released the "Communique 
on Development of Labor Industry in 1993" on 26 April. The 
excerpts of the communique reads as follows: 
  The work concerning labor is aimed at cultivating and 
developing the labor market, further reforming the labor, wage 
and social security systems, improving all types of reform 
measures in a comprehensive way and attaining new achievements. 
However, the 1993 situation was grim in ensuring safe 
production. The number of labor disputes increased greatly, and 
the rate of unemployment also rose. All this merits our 
attention. 
<H5>  I. Labor Employment </H5>
  China's labor force totalled 820 million in 1993, and those 
with employment amounted to 605.9 million, up 11.58 million over 
1992, of whom the number of wage-earners totalled 276.95 million 
accounting for 45.7 percent of the total number of employees. 
Among the wage earners, 150.4 million worked in cities and 
townships; 3.1 million worked in the private sector; and 123.45 
worked in rural enterprises. Among the urban workers, 110.94 
million worked in state-run units, an increase of 2.05 million; 
36.03 million worked in urban collectively owned units, a 
decrease of 180,000; and 3.43 million worked in other economic 
sectors, up 610,000 as compared with the end of 1992. 
  In 1993, there were 11.47 million people seeking jobs in 
urban areas throughout the country, and 7.05 million of them 
found employment. At the end of 1993, 4.2 million of them were 
still unemployed with a rate of unemployment of 2.6 percent. 
Among those who found jobs, 3.1 million worked in state-run 
units, 2.02 million in urban collectively run economic units, 
and 980,000 in various units in other economic sectors. The 
number of self-employed laborers totalled 950,000. 
  Enterprises in the service trades which hire many laborers 
flourished while consolidating themselves. There are 200,000 
such enterprises which hired 9.15 million laborers. Their total 
output value reached 160 billion yuan. They delivered taxes and 
profits of 12 billion yuan to the state treasury, and gave jobs 
to 1.196 million jobless and surplus laborers. 
  At the end of 1993, 18,000 employment agencies were set up 
in 
28 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities under the 
direct administration of the central government, of which 15,000 
were set up by labor departments. 
  The labor system reform with labor contracts signed by all 
the workers for the firm establishment of labor relations had 
developed in an overall manner from the experimental stage. At 
the end of 1993, the number of workers in state and collectively 
run enterprises in the country who had participated in the labor 
system reform had reached 55 million, of whom 31 percent of the 
total number of enterprise workers or 35 million were under the 
labor contract system. The labor system reform was promoted in 
an overall manner in 200 cities and counties throughout China. 
The reform of the labor contract system was basically completed 
in Jilin Province and in Shenzhen, Zhuzhou, Yancheng, Anyang and 
other cities. While promoting the labor system reform, various 
localities always attached importance to allocating jobs to 
surplus personnel laid off by enterprises. In 1993, 1.25 million 
surplus workers found jobs. 
<H5>  II. Wage Distribution </H5>
  Workers' wages were further raised. In 1993, the total 
amount 
of wages earned by urban workers throughout the country reached 
477 billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over 1992. An average worker 
earned 3,236 yuan year, up 19.4 percent over 1992. The actual 
rate of growth was 2.8 percent if the factor of inflation was 
taken into consideration. An average worker in a state-run unit 
earned 3,441 yuan a year, up 19.6 percent over 1992. 
  With the enterprises changing the way they operated and the 
system of wage distribution constantly under reform, 18,000 
enterprises and 14 million workers had carried out experiments 
in implementing the job-skill wage system at the end of 1993. 
  As for the macro-control over the labor force and wages, a 
flexible wage system was adopted in 30 provinces, autonomous 
regions, municipalities under the direct administration of the 
central government and cities with provincial-level economic 
decision-making authority in the country by the end of 1993. In 
addition, the Ministry of Labor also sent a flexible wage 
control plan to 11 districts to exercise flexible control over 
some ministries and commissions and corporations. As a result, 
the state had further strengthened its control over the total 
amount of wages to workers. The actual growth rate of the total 
amount of workers' wages rose 4.3 percent in 1993, which was 
lower than the 13.4 percent rate of growth of the GNP. The 
actual average worker's wage rose 2.8 percent, lower than the 
10.9 percent growth rate of the social labor productivity. This 
conformed with the principle of the "two lower's." 
<H5>  III. Social Security </H5>
  In 1993, the nation received 46.1 billion yuan of social 
insurance funds (funds raised by various sectors themselves not 
included), and paid off 41.9 billion yuan to beneficiaries with 
a carry-over balance of 28.8 billion yuan (including special 
state bonds purchased) of which the state received 44 billion 
yuan basic old-age pension funds and paid off 40.8 billion yuan 
to old-age pensioners with a carry-over balance of 24.5 billion 
yuan. 
  At the end of 1993, 618 cities and counties in the country 
carried out reform in providing basic old-age pensions to 25 
million workers who worked for state-run enterprises. 
  The amount of mutual assistance funds for retirees further 
increased. At the end of 1993, 13 provinces, autonomous regions 
and municipalities under the direct administration of the 
central government had helped raise pension funds. In addition 
to the state-owned enterprises which had already been raising 
their own pension funds in various cities and counties 
throughout the country, 1,927 cities and counties had developed 
the program for urban mutual assistance retirement funds, an 
increase of 168 over 1992. In the whole country, 590,000 
enterprises and 73.36 million workers had participated in the 
program to collect mutual assistance retirement funds. 
Meanwhile, 3,100 enterprises had participated in the 
supplementary program for old-age pension insurance, involving 
500,000 people. Over 6,000 enterprises participated in the 
old-age pension insurance program in the form of individual 
savings with 700,000 participants. Some 1,000 cities and 
counties paid pensions through banks or social insurance 
organizations. 
  In China, 11 million people in 500 cities and counties in 19 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities under the 
direct administration of the central government participated in 
the industrial injury insurance reform, an increase of 140 
cities and counties than in 1992. Some 260,000 workers in 221 
cities and counties made contributions to mutual assistance 
funds to defray medical expenses for workers' major illnesses; 
and 280,000 retirees in 134 cities and counties also made 
contributions to mutual assistance funds for their own medical 
care. 
  Coverage of unemployment insurance was further expanded, and 
the system gradually improved. By the end of 1993, 79.24 million 
workers in 532,000 enterprises participated in the unemployment 
insurance program. In 1993, unemployment insurance funds of 1.63 
billion yuan were collected, and 930 million yuan were paid for 
unemployment, medical expenses during the period of 
unemployment, job training and the participation in the 
self-relief through production program. The labor departments in 
various localities provided unemployment relief funds for 1.03 
million people who lost their jobs, playing a positive role in 
stabilizing the society. 
  New progress was made in reforming the childbirth insurance 
system. By the end of 1993, the system of childbirth insurance 
for woman workers was instituted in 268 cities and counties, 
marking an increase of 170 over 1992 and covering 5.5 million 
workers. 
<H5>  IV. Safe Production </H5>
  The situation in safe production was grim in 1993. The 
number 
of accidents and injuries increased on a large scale. This 
merits our attention. 
  In 1993, 19,798 workers died of industrial injuries in 
various enterprises throughout the country, up 18.5 percent over 
1992. There were 616 incidents leaving three or more people dead 
in each case and causing 3,819 deaths in total. The number of 
incidents and deaths in 1993 was 6.2 percent and 3.8 percent 
respectively higher than that in 1992. During the incidents in 
which workers died of industrial injuries, there were 9,112 
mining incidents, leaving 10,883 workers dead. As compared with 
1992, the number of incidents and deaths rose by 48 percent and 
12.4 percent respectively. 
  The number of highway incidents remained high in 1993. There 
were 242,343 traffic accidents leaving 63,508 people dead and 
142,251 people injured and causing direct economic losses of 1 
billion yuan. 
  There were 38,094 fire hazards in the country during 1993, 
leaving 2,467 people dead, an increase of 27.4 percent over 
1992. The fire hazards caused economic losses of 1.12 billion 
yuan (damages caused by forest fire not included), up 62.3 
percent over 1992. 
  There were 3,175 train accidents in 1993, causing economic 
losses of 46.781 million yuan, a drop of 9.2 percent over 1992. 
There were 2,530 train accidents in 1993, leaving 181 people 
dead, an increase of 38 percent over 1992. There were 16,353 
accidents along the railways, leaving 9,989 people dead, an 
increase of 10 percent over 1992. 
  In 1993, enterprises in the shipping industry under the 
administration of the Ministry of Communications, freighters of 
the local transportation departments and the freighters and 
ferry boats in rural areas had 2,008 general accidents, marking 
a drop of 18.4 percent and leaving 557 people dead, about the 
same level as in 1992. Thirty seven ships sank, a drop of 2.3 
percent, and the accidents caused economic losses of 147 million 
yuan, an increase of 13.2 percent over 1992. 
  In 1993, China's civil aviation industry reported three 
incidents of the first grade and two incidents of the second 
grade in transport flights. It reported two incidents of the 
first grade and two incidents of the second grade in general 
flights. 
<H5>  Development of Vocational Skills </H5>
  In 1993, the number of schools for the training of 
technicians increased to 4,477, up 85 over 1992. The schools 
had a total of 664,000 students (57,000 students in rural areas) 
with 171,700 boarding students and 335,000 faculty members. 
There were 2,525 job training centers in the country, an 
increase of 106 over 1992. New progress was made in training 
armymen to do civilian work. In 1993, 276,000 armymen were 
trained to do civilian work, an increase of 40.8 percent or 
80,000 over 1992. During 1993, the nation hired 340,000 
technicians and senior technicians. 
<H5>  Arbitration of Labor Disputes and Labor Supervision </H5>
  With the continuous reform of the labor system, the system 
in handling labor disputes is getting better and better. In 
1993, the labor dispute arbitration committees at all levels 
handled 12,358 cases involving labor disputes, up 51.6 percent 
over 1992. These cases involved 34,794 workers, an increase of 
99.8 percent. They also handled 684 cases involving collective 
labor disputes, an increase of 24.8 percent over 1992. These 
cases involved 19,468 workers, up 113.9 percent over 1992. 
  The work for labor supervision was further improved. Labor 
supervisory organs were set up in 16 provinces, autonomous 
regions and municipalities under the direct administration of 
the central government and in some regions. A system wherein the 
masses might report cases involving illegal labor employment 
activities was established. Extensive checkups were carried out 
on all forms of labor employment. 
<H5>  Social Labor Productivity </H5>
  China's GNP totalled 3.138 trillion yuan in 1993, up 13.4 
percent over 1992. The social labor productivity in 1993 
calculated on the basis of the GNP rose by 10.9 percent over 
1992. 
Note: The labor force resource was calculated in 
accordance 
with the new specification. It referred to those who were 16 
year-old and older people (excluding those who were unable to 
work and the convicts in prison).

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Guohong (2612 0948 1347), Fudan University's </F>
Population Research Institute: "Population Control Under 
Conditions of Market Economy"] 
  [Excerpt] The transformation from a planned economy to a 
market economy and intensification of economic structural 
reforms have brought a series of systematic changes in China's 
society. These changes affect China's population control in two 
respects, one is their influence on the reproductive subjects, 
the other their influence on the family planning management 
system. 
  How does a market economy affect population control through 
its influence on the reproductive subjects? Establishing a 
market economic system involves reforming various current 
economic systems ranging from systems of property right, 
enterprise and commerce to those of wages, social welfare and 
protection and education; all of these are being transformed 
from "planned systems" to "market-oriented systems." In the 
process of changing to a market system, the family also needs to 
adapt to demands of the changing market, i.e. the family is 
becoming a production as well as a consumption unit; like the 
enterprises, the family unit should also be independent, 
responsible for its own profits and losses, and be able to 
rationally deploy resources to gain the maximum benefits. In 
allocating various resources (including manpower), the family 
will focus on input and production, capital as well as analysis 
and comparison of returns on capital. Children represent the 
family's future manpower resource, so they naturally will be 
included in the family's economic calculations. The family needs 
to anticipate the children's needs in the changing market 
economy, including their numbers and qualities. In the early 
stages of the market economy, the manpower requirement for 
economic development emphasized mainly quantity, with relatively 
low requirement for quality; these circumstances led families to 
place a relatively high premium on children in quantitative 
terms, creating a conflict between people's desire for 
reproduction and the country's need for population control, and 
as well increasing the difficulties of population control. In 
the economically more backward areas, this was particularly the 
case, and there the stronger the demand for manpower in 
quantitative terms, the more excess births occurred, which in 
turn led to even more stringent population control measures. 
This is to say that after a market economic system becomes 
established, man no longer considers reproduction as serving the 
sole objective of perpetuating the family line, but sees 
reproduction mostly as another form of economic behavior to be 
considered as part of the family's economic decision-making 
process; in that sense, the reproductive subjects play the role 
as "economic subjects." When "economic subjects" make a decision 
on reproduction, they will consider carefully the child's value 
and the cost of raising the child versus his/her projected 
benefits; in the early stages of economic development, 
particularly when a planned economy is being transformed into a 
market economy, this view is detrimental to population control. 
  A market economy makes the reproductive subjects think more 
carefully about the family economy and see child-bearing from 
the standpoint of the family's economic future; in the early 
period of transformation from one economic system to another, 
this tendency can lead to strong demands for more children, 
increasing the difficulties toward reaching the population 
control goal. This is how the market economy affects population 
control through its influence on the reproductive subjects. 
Another and even more important aspect is how a market economy 
affects population control through its influence on the family 
planning management system. To begin with, establishing a market 
economic system means that governmental functions need to 
undergo basic changes. In a planned economy, government roles 
and functions controlled the economy by unifying all aspects of 
planning and taking a command role in the national economy, but 
under market economic conditions, such government roles and 
functions will gradually diminish and disappear; government will 
mainly rely on information from the market to indirectly control 
and coordinate the market, and government's tactics will also 
change from exercise of administrative command to reliance on 
economic measures, laws and regulations. The family planning 
management system built on the foundation of a planned economy 
naturally involved government exercising its role under planned 
economic conditions; under market economic conditions, however, 
the family planning management system will change, and the 
control and coordination functions of management will be 
exercised through various economic measures, laws and 
regulations. Family planning as a basic policy of China will not 
change, but its management system and approaches will change to 
accommodate to demands of the market economy. 
  Moreover, establishing a market economic system implies 
changing the organizational system. In a planned economy, the 
organizational system consisted of separate sub-systems 
operating under an overall system of administrative authorities, 
i.e. centralized management going from the Center to the 
province-city-prefecture level, then to the counties and 
villages. The organization system under market economic 
conditions consists of sub-systems of companies, groups and 
other organizations in between these two categories, such as 
trading centers, accounting firms, etc. including systems of 
finance, taxation and statistics. Changes in these sub-systems 
will lead to corresponding changes in the family planning 
organizational system; that is to say family planning can be one 
of the organizational systems in a market economy; and the 
former centrally managed family planning system will either 
diminish in effectiveness or, after transformation, become more 
effective along with other organizational systems. Under 
conditions of market economy, we should consider carefully the 
question of coordinating family planning work with the work of 
other organizational systems. 
  In addition, the establishment of market economy requires a 
series of laws, regulations and policies, and this will mean 
revising and changing the current laws and regulations based on 
a planned economy, and drafting new ones which will accommodate 
and support the market economy. Family planning polices and 
regulations are not yet perfected; under conditions of market 
economy, we also need to address the question how best to 
coordinate and adjust family planning policies and regulations 
with those dealing with other aspects of the economy. 
  Finally, establishing a market economy requires people 
changing their thinking and accepting basic principles and 
demands of the market of open and fair competition, and freedom 
and equality; economic activities will no longer be subject to 
government's command control but will obey the market. This will 
mean breaking up the pattern of lower-level authorities obeying 
the higher-level, which in terms obeys the center; and "red-tag 
documents" will diminish in importance. In terms of future 
population control, how family planning can be coordinated and 
adjusted with the above changes is a serious challenge, and 
should be an important agenda item for study. 
  That the market economy poses a serious and multifaceted 
challenge to population control is therefore obvious. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Fang Pingxiao (2455 1627 2556) and Fu Xiangdong </F>
(4395 0686 2639): "Options and Demands of the Peasants of the 
Large Cotton-Growing Province of Shandong--Questionnaire Survey 
of 300 Shandong Cotton Farmers"] 
  [Excerpts] To obtain an up-to-date idea of the mentality of 
the cotton farmers, and to correctly assess this year's cotton 
production, the agricultural investigation team of Shandong 
Province conducted a questionnaire survey of 300 cotton farmers 
in the cotton-growing region, i.e. in the five counties of 
Xiajin, Gaotang, Qihe, Caoxian, and Dingtao. 
  1. Cotton Acreage Continues To Decline 
  Following the establishment and perfection of the socialist 
market economy, market awareness among the peasants gradually 
increased, with the result that many cotton farmers again 
reduced their cotton acreage in their arrangements for this 
year's cultivation. The total acreage contracted for by the 300 
cotton farmers involved in the present investigation was 
2,258.43 mu. The actual acreage sown to cotton last year was 
826.7 mu, or an average of 0.6 mu per person. Arrangements this 
year were for 736.1 mu, i.e. 90.6 mu, or 11 percent less than 
last year, the average per person being only 0.07 mu. Of the 300 
cotton farmers, 118 households--i.e. 37.3 percent--were 
preparing to reduce acreage sown to cotton. In 89 of these 
households the reduction would be to over 20 percent, and 21 
households decided not to grow any cotton at all. In the case of 
112 households--i.e. 37.3 percent--arrangements were for a 
cotton-growing acreage equal to that of the preceding year. The 
balance of 70 households arranged for a cotton-growing acreage 
that would be larger than that of the preceding year. The 
investigation revealed that this year's trend is one of a 
continued decline in acreage sown to cotton. Computing at an 11 
percent reduction, the cotton acreage throughout the province 
would only be around 10.15 million mu, hardly sufficient to 
fulfill the provincial government's plan for an acreage of 18 
million mu. Unless forceful measures are adopted, this will be a 
year of the lowest cotton acreage since 1981. 
  2. Reasons for the Decline in Cotton Acreage 
  What are the true reasons for the year by year decline in 
cotton acreage? The 118 cotton-growing peasant households who 
reduced acreage replied as follows: Ninety households--i.e. 76.3 
percent--listed in first position their serious losses due to 
insect pests. Forty-three households--i.e. 36.4 percent--listed 
in second position that cotton growing required much labor, was 
high in costs and low in returns. Altogether 62 households of 
cotton-growing peasants, i.e. over half of those who reduced 
cotton acreage, listed the low state procurement prices in third 
place. Ninety-four households listed in fourth position the long 
time that it takes to grow cotton and the greater risks 
involved. Ten cotton-growing peasants investigated in Jinqidian 
Village, Xiajin County, had last year sown a total of 23.9 mu to 
cotton, but at harvest time there were only 8.2 mu of that 
acreage left, from which they harvested 470 kg of unginned 
cotton, or 57.3 kg per mu. One of these cotton farmers had 
harvested only 10 kg. and when he started to talk about the 
damage due to bollworm infestation he was so grief-stricken that 
he began to cry. 
  The main reason why cotton farmers this year again reduced 
their cotton acreage is to be seen in that cotton-growing is 
still beset with many difficulties. The 300 cotton-growing 
households presently investigated recognized as the main 
difficulties in cotton growing: First, the difficulty in coping 
with insect infestations, and 230 cotton-growing 
households--i.e. 76.7 percent--listed this in top position. 
During the last two years, there had been an enormous increase 
in insect pests, and the peasants have expended a great amount 
of human and financial resources in combating these pests. The 
expenditure for pesticides alone added over 100 yuan per mu to 
the costs of production, and as this was not fully effective, it 
was supplemented by manpower, but the result of all these 
efforts was still not satisfactory. In this year's cotton 
growing, the peasants feared most the large infestation by 
insect pests, against which they by themselves seem to be 
powerless. Second, shortage of production capital. This problem 
was listed in second place by 158 households, i.e. 52.6 percent. 
The continuous reduction of cotton production over the last two 
years has reduced per capita income of peasants in the 
cotton-producing district by over 150 yuan. Cotton farmers are 
short of ready cash, while production costs for cotton are high, 
so that the insufficiency of capital is the second great 
difficulty for cotton farmers. Third, there is a serious 
shortage of cotton seeds for improved varieties. The cotton 
farmers reacted by last year growing less cotton, which resulted 
not only in less income for the individual cotton farmer, but 
also in the difficulty of less seed being retained and available 
for planting. With so little cotton harvested, there could 
hardly be any seed retained, and the problem of shortage of seed 
was particularly acute for the summer planting of cotton. Some 
of the cotton seed for summer planting supplied last year 
centrally to the villages and townships had poor germination 
capacity, and some cotton farmers just stopped planting 
altogether, exchanging the cotton seed for cotton oil. "Even the 
cleverest housewife cannot cook a meal without rice." Without 
seed cotton farmers have no way to grow cotton. Fourth, 
insufficient acreage available as cotton fields. There were 174 
cotton-growing households that listed this in fourth place. 
During the autumn planting season last year, the soil had good 
moisture content, and in addition grain prices had gone up, so 
that many cotton farmers expanded their wheat fields, and did 
not leave much acreage for cotton. Insufficiency of cotton field 
acreage added yet another major difficulty for peasants wanting 
to grow cotton. 
  3. Some Problems That Cotton Farmers Hope Will be Resolved 
  Cotton is the major cash crop of Shandong Province, also one 
of the major sources of income for peasants of the 
cotton-growing districts. Although there is presently no great 
urgency for cotton farmers to grow cotton, the farmers 
themselves are not willing to give up cotton production. Cotton 
farmers hope to further develop cotton production, and they hope 
the state will resolve the following problems as quickly as 
possible: 
  First, most significantly resolve the problem of the supply 
of highly effective, low-toxic pesticides; Second, 
perfect a more socially effective service organization that 
would promptly render technological services; Third, as speedily 
as possible open up the cotton market, allowing all 
cotton-growing peasants to trade freely; Fourth, resolve as soon 
as possible the problem of a more favorable policy and the 
problem of delayed payments. 
  The vast number of cotton farmers also demand that the 
relevant agencies take strict punitive action according to law 
against producers and providers of spurious or inferior means of 
production, especially spurious or inferior pesticides, and that 
economic compensation be paid where damage has been caused. They 
demand that effective measures be adopted to control the large 
price increases for means of production, so as to reduce costs 
of cotton production. The state should at the same time, and as 
soon as possible, publish its policy as regards cotton 
production, so that all cotton farmers may "feel at ease" when 
they again take up planting cotton.

<F P=106> [Article by Ma Xiaohe (7456 2556 3109), affiliated with the </F>
State Planning Commission's Economic Studies Institute: "The 
GATT and China's Agricultural Development"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  I. Favorable GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture </H5>
  Once we "recover our GATT seat," Chinese agriculture will 
first acquire the proper profit and development opportunities, 
mainly in the following areas: 
  1. It will contribute to the export of Chinese farm 
products and their manufactured goods. As China is a large 
agricultural developing country, farm products and their 
maunfactured goods have always occupied a crucial position in 
our export trade. Meanwhile, most Chinese farm products still 
have a clear price advantage in export trade, with most of our 
domestic farm product prices now being generally lower than 
their international market prices. If we export these farm 
products to the international market, they will be highly 
competitive. So China must and can sharply expand its export 
trade in farm products and their manufactured goods. Once we 
"recover our GATT seat," we will win many preferential terms, 
such as tariff concessions, and reduction and elimination of 
nontariff measures and barriers, including quantitative 
restrictions. It is of particular importance that as a 
developing country, China will also enjoy according to pertinent 
GATT provisions its differentiated and more favorable treatment 
toward developing countries. That is, that quantitative 
restrictions by developed countries on export trade with 
developing ones should be more flexible, and that developed 
countries should fulfill their promised committment to 
developing ones to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other 
barriers. The acquisition of these favorable terms will be bound 
to stimulate sharp growth in the export trade of Chinese farm 
products and their maunfactured goods. In addition, the 
conclusion of the Uruguay round of multilateral GATT 
negotiations will bring a sharp liberalization of farm product 
trade on a worldwide scale. This will obviously be even more 
favorable to farm product foreign trade. 
  2. It will help China to utilize foreign investment, 
introduce technology, and upgrade our traditional agriculture. 
GATT trade accomodation limits are now expanding from tariffs 
and nontariff measures on traditional goods trade to new fields, 
such as service trade, intellectual property rights, and 
trade-related investment measures. The conclusion of trade 
agreements in these new fields will bring definite growth 
opportunities to Chinese agriculture. In the 1990s, China's 
agricultural development is in an exceptionally crucial period, 
during which farm product growth will need much funding and 
technical support. But due to China's current stage of 
industrialization, we are experiencing related domestic funding 
and technology shortages. Once we "recover our GATT seat," 
China will be able to exploit our signatory status, based on the 
unconditional MFN principle and the special terms for developing 
countries, to win technical, economic, and financial aid from 
GATT members and international financial institutions for the 
development of Chinese agriculture. Economically developed 
countries and certain international business and trade 
organizations are now all paying more attention to the 
improvement of agricultural development conditions in developing 
countries to resolve their subsistence-climate issues. In these 
areas, they are all willing to provide aid, such as funding and 
technology. Obviously, as a developing country and a GATT 
member, we will have the full opportunity to completely utilize 
such aid to build our domestic agricultural infrastructure and 
improve our agricultural production conditions, in order to 
reinforce our agricultural development stamina. 
  3. It will be favorable to China's use of developed-country 
management and agricultural-development experience. China is 
now in a reform period, in which our overall economy is 
preparing for the transition to a socialist market economy. 
Meanwhile, this period is also one in which Chinese 
industrialization is making the transition from an initial stage 
to an intermediate one. Faced with this reform and development 
climate, we still lack experience in agricultural management and 
development. But once we "recover our GATT seat," China can 
learn and understand from GATT members, particularly 
economically developed countries, their agricultural development 
principles, policies, and measures in the intermediate 
industrialization period on market economy terms, drawing on 
their experience to reform and forumulate China's agricultural 
development policy, to promote domestic agricultural development. 
  4. "GATT recovery" will be beneficial to Chinese imports of 
farm products, particularly grain. China is a country with a 
relative shortage of agricultural resources, where economic 
development and rapid population growth have always made 
farm-product supply and demand relations very tight. To balance 
these supply and demand relations, China has been a net 
grain-importing country since the 1960s. Looking to the 
future, as our population enters its third childbearing peak and 
our economy grows quickly, our society is likely to have to 
steadily increase its exports of farm products, especially 
grain. According to GATT principles on concessional tariffs, 
free trade, and reciprocity, China will certainly win many 
concessional terms in importing such farm products from GATT 
members. 
<H5>  II. Negative GATT Impacts on Chinese Agriculture </H5>
  Once China acquires GATT standing, our enjoyment of the 
various GATT rights will win certain favorable terms for our 
agricultural development. But meanwhile, as China will have to 
assume corresponding committments, such as lowering our tariffs, 
reducing or eliminating nontariff barriers and measures, and 
opening domestic markets, this will likely have certain negative 
impacts on Chinese agricultural development, mostly in the 
following areas: 
  1. Once China lowers tariffs and eliminates or adjusts 
certain trade-restriction measures, certain low-cost and 
high-quantity farm products with relative quality advantages 
from other GATT countries will be bound to gain access to 
Chinese markets, to compete sharply with Chinese farm products. 
This will be a definite shock to certain Chinese farm 
products. The most-impacted will be ones, such as food-use 
vegetable oils, nonfood-use vegetable oils, rubber, lumber, 
sugar, tobacco, soybeans, milk products, and tropical fruits. 
In this case, domestic production of high-priced but 
relatively low-quality farm products will probably be confronted 
with the danger of shrinkage. And the sag in production of 
these products will directly impact peasant job and income 
growth. 
  2. Once we "recover our GATT status," GATT members will 
certainly demand that China open its farm product markets wider, 
which will mean weakening our many import-protection measures 
for farm products in ways, such as lowering tariff rates, and 
reducing all tariffs and nontariff barriers and measures that 
have a negative impact on farm product trade. This is likely to 
have certain negative impacts on China's future agricultural 
development. Since China has a huge population, a severe 
shortage of agricultural resources, and an exceptionally weak 
agricultural foundation, requiring domestic agriculture to 
produce enough to meet most industrialization needs under these 
conditions will obviously require much agricultural support, by 
taking the route of protection of agriculture. Even if we 
adjust our urban-rural relations and stabilize our rural social 
environment, China is sill likely to have to take the route in 
the future of protecting our agricultural development, which 
will certainly clash with GATT principles. Based on the 
regulations drafted in the previous seven rounds of GATT 
negotiations, the negative impact on Chinese agriculture from 
GATT reentry would seem to be not too obvious, or to be only 
local. This is because we could make use of pertinent GATT 
provisions to request exemption from GATT obligations, to 
protect our staple farm product production and trade. But as 
the Uruguay round of negotiations has been concluded, making 
farm product trade more liberal, all measures that impact market 
access and export competition will fall under stronger and more 
effective GATT regulations and disciplines. In which case, 
faced with trade liberalization and open farm product markets, 
with Chinese agriculture unable to be protected more strongly, 
the steady rise in production costs will very quickly dissolve 
our competitive price advantage. Then subject to overseas farm 
product pressure, our domestic agriculture will certainly be 
faced with a stiff challenge. The first to be affected by this 
challenge, and the area that will be most deeply impacted, will 
be Chinese grain production. Since reform and opening, China's 
domestic staple food production costs have generally risen at a 
rate of more than 10 percent a year. This rise in grain 
production cost has clearly brought our grain prices closer to 
international grain-market prices. In the future, as farm 
product marketization intensifies and production costs continue 
to rise, our domestic grain prices will very quickly exceed 
international market prices. At which time, with open markets 
and less protection, large amounts of international grain are 
likely to flood the Chinese market, which will certainly pose a 
severe threat to Chinese grain production. 
  3. GATT reentry will affect our domestic farm product supply 
and demand balance, sharpening the shortages of certain farm 
products. As stated above, while most domestic farm product 
prices are still generally lower than international market 
prices, "GATT reentry," winning us many preferential treatments, 
will mean that China's farm product exports with competitive 
price advantages will certainly grow sharply. But while this 
growth will bring China a huge foreign exchange income, it is 
also likely to quickly reduce domestic supplies of similar 
products to create shortages. This is because limited by a 
severe shortage of agricultural natural resources, farm product 
growth is also limited, while rapid domestic economic 
development and population growth will make farm product demand 
ever sharper. Under these conditions, large-scale exports of 
certain farm products will be bound to reduce domestic farm 
product supplies, and even cause shortages. 
  4. In the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations, a series of 
farm product trade liberalization measures were set forth, one 
of the most important being the lowering of farm product 
production and export subsidies by preset deadlines. While 
differences exist on the extent of subsidy reduction by the 
Keynes group composed of 14 countries, such as the U.S., 
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and Canada, with the EC, GATT 
members unamiously agree that subsidy reduction is imperative. 
Once production and exports subsidies are lowered, the direct 
impact on farm products will be higher prices. Concerned 
international economists have specially studied this, holding 
that the corresponding liberalization of grain trade among 
industrially developed countries alone will likely bring an 
average increase in world farm product prices of 22 percent. 
This will include price increases of 37 percent for wheat, 26 
percent for feed, 21 percent for beef and mutton, 12 percent for 
pork, poultry, and eggs, 26 percent for dairy products, and 37 
percent for sugar. Undoubtedly, higher farm product prices will 
benefit net farm product exporting countries, enabling them to 
export less farm products in exchange for more foreign exchange 
income. But conversely, it will be adverse to net farm product 
importing countries, as they will only acquire less farm product 
imports for more foreign exchange. Since China is generally a 
net farm product exporting country, reducing the various 
subsidies will benefit us. But as China is a net grain 
importing country, higher grain market prices will certainly 
increase our foreign exchange spending on imported grain, which 
will be adverse to maintaining a domestic balance between grain 
supply and demand. 

<H5>    III. Development Policies That Chinese Agriculture Should </H5>
Choose 
  1. From now on, China should conduct active adjustments and 
reforms in areas, such as macroeconomic organization and farm 
management system, in full preparation for a positive acceptance 
of all GATT impacts on agriculture. I hold that the greatest 
current issues for Chinese agriculture and farm-related 
industries are decentralized macroeconomic control, system 
disorder, and a lack of organizational coordination mechanisms. 
In such a state, China not only cannot make very good use of 
the favorable terms brought to agriculture by the GATT, but also 
will find it very hard to cope with the adverse impacts that it 
will have on our agricultural development. So it is suggested 
that China could start by organizing a policy, advisory, and 
coordination agency integrating production and trade of farm 
products and their manufactured goods, which agency would set 
and coordinate policy related to production and trade of farm 
products and their manufactured goods, providing agriculture 
with policy advice and macroeconomic control in areas, such as 
utilizing foreign investment, introducing technology, and 
importing and exporting products. 
  2. We need to draw up as quickly as possible good 
farm-related development policies and plans, to pave the way for 
our taking full and good advantage of the favorable 
opportunities brought to Chinese agricultural development by our 
"GATT reentry." For instance, once China "regains our GATT 
seat," as to its export advantages for certain Chinese farm 
products and their manufactured goods, we should draw up 
corresponding development plans, and adopt certain incentive and 
support policies. In the areas of using foreign investment, 
introducing technology, and importing farm products, we could 
make certain advance plans, to keep from missing opportunities 
and creating unnecessary losses. 
  3. As to the possible negative impacts of the GATT on our 
agriculture, we should also take corresponding countermeasures, 
which I hold to be as follows: A. As a developing country, 
China should make full use of pertinent GATT provisions, to 
provide suitable protection for our production and trade of 
staple farm products, by strengthening state support for 
agriculture, investing the necessary funding and technology, and 
actively cultivating our agricultural development capability. 
B. While observing GATT provisions, and within GATT-allowed 
limits, we should give our agriculture the proper support. We 
need to take certain active legal, economic, and technical steps 
to encourage and support farm operators in consciously reducing 
material consumption, conserving labor, and raising product 
quality, to ultimately improve our farm product competitive 
capability. In addition, to lower agricultural production 
costs and improve our product competitive advantages, China also 
needs to begin to achieve land economy of scale and raise labor 
productivity, by applying certain effective principles and 
policies to shift our surplus agricultural workforce to other 
industries. China could suitably deregulate urban job markets 
and speed up nonfarm production and development, to absorb the 
large amount of surplus labor that is stuck in the farm sector. 
This would eliminate the waste and surplus in our agricultural 
workforce, expand the operating scale of our farm workers, and 
raise their labor productivity. C. Due to land-resource 
limitations, China's agriculture will be able to neither produce 
all of the farm products needed for our economic development, or 
meet all other economic development needs as to farm product 
volume. So it is recommended that starting now, China should 
choose farm products with domestic production advantages and 
strong links to the national economy, for priority support and 
development. We should correspondingly phase out those farm 
products with no domestic production advantages and weak links 
to the national economy, appropriately conceding the domestic 
markets for these products. 
  4. We need to take the initiative to lower certain farm 
product import tariffs, and reduce certain nontariff measures. 
Except for a few staple products, such as grain, China's current 
tariff rates on most farm products and their manufactured goods 
are 50-70 percent, and in some cases even as high as 150-180 
percent, which is obviously too high. Once we regain our GATT 
status, we will have to lower our tariff rates on certain farm 
products and their manufactured goods. What method should we use 
to lower tariffs that would have the minimum impact on China's 
agriculture and its product trade? I hold that the more ideal 
method would be to first lower tariffs on those farm products 
that are less tied to our national economy. Moreover, we could 
consider lowering these product tariffs more sharply. 
Conversely, as to those farm products that are more tied to 
our national economy, we should strictly control 
tariff-adjustment times and degrees. Only in this way can we 
reduce to the minimum the negative impact on our agriculture of 
lower tariffs. In addition, based on GATT demands, China is 
also going to have to reduce certain nontariff measures against 
farm product imports. In this area, we can act in accordance 
with the links between farm products and our national economy, 
by taking the initiative to eliminate certain administrative 
measures, such as product licenses and import examination and 
approval, and by streamlining technology health-criteria 
examination and customs entry formalities.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhou Xiang (5297 5046): "Increasing Numbers of </F>
Teachers, Owed Back Wages, Leave Their Profession"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] On 23 December 1992 GUANGMING 
RIBAO gave front-wage headline treatment to an article entitled 
"Save the Teachers, Save the Children." According to the 
article, Yilong County in Sichuan, the hometown of 
Commander-in-Chief Zhu De [2612 1795], was seven months behind 
in its payment to more than 7,000 teachers who were owed a total 
of 7 million yuan, forcing them to survive on help from friends 
and relatives. Japan's ASAHI SHIMBUN picked up the story and 
spread it around the world in a report entitled "China Would 
Rather Build Factories than Schools." People overseas were 
shocked while everybody at home from top to bottom was stunned. 
Has it occurred to anybody that what is happening in Yilong 
County is also taking place in more than half of China to 
varying extents? This hot topic shook up every social quarter. 
Descriptions of the teachers' plight prove that these belated 
news stories are absolutely no fabrication. 
  -- According to surveys by Hebei on the province's 130 
counties and municipalities, 75 of them have fallen behind in 
their wage payment to teachers, owing the latter 79.2 million 
yuan in all. 
  -- As of 19 May 1993, almost 80,000 teachers in 9 
municipalities, 24 counties (prefectures), and 465 townships in 
Liaoning Province were owed 78.51 million yuan in back wages. 
Many people have not received a single paycheck several months 
in a row. 
  -- Of the 83 counties in Guangxi Autonomous Region, 70 have 
not been paying their teachers on time. The amount of unpaid 
wages exceeded 80 million yuan between last year and the first 
half of this year and reached almost 100 million yuan if you go 
back several years. 
  In one province teachers were owed a whopping 44.51 million 
yuan in unpaid wages. At one point they did not receive a single 
dime for a record 6 months. Owing to wage adjustments and 
because they were given more senior-level responsibilities, some 
teachers were due to receive wage increases retroactively. 
However, the actual payment has been delayed, in some cases as 
long as six years. Province-wide, 18,000 public-school teachers 
have been affected by the late payments, each owed more than 
1,800 yuan on average. Also owed back wages are 25,000 
private-school teachers, each owed about 472 yuan in subsidies 
on the average. 
  Nationwide, elementary and high school teachers are owed 1.4 
billion yuan in back wages. Never before in the history of the 
PRC has the nation owed so many teachers so much money for so 
long with such serious effects. The legitimate rights and 
interests of teachers have been severely violated and the 
prestige of the party and the government has eroded. Among the 
12 major professions in society, wages in the teaching 
profession are already the second lowest. The profession cannot 
even keep its ninth ranking. 
  Meanwhile, according to reports in ZHONGGUO QINGNIAN BAO, 
administrative units above the county level nationwide had 
approved the spending of 14.5 billion yuan to purchase small 
cars by the first half of 1993. In Sichuan, they gave a villa 
valued at 1 million yuan to a movie actor as a gift but have 
fallen behind in their payment of teachers' wages, owing the 
latter almost 100 million yuan. Liaoning has spent as much as 
1.3 billion yuan to buy sedans but keeps falling into arrears 
when it comes to paying its teachers. [passage omitted] 
  Where have the educational funds gone? Where have the 
teachers' wages gone? Year after year education makes its way to 
the top of every government's agenda. Year after year people's 
congresses at all levels boost educational spending in the 
budget. Year after year education and teachers find themselves 
in dire financial straits. [passage omitted] 
  LIAOWANG, the weekly magazine, devoted its fourth issue this 
year to a special report on this topic. Comrade Yang Chunmao 
[2799 2504 5399], personnel chief of the State Education 
Commission, expressed deep concern about the loss of teachers 
nationwide in a piece titled "The Foundation of Basic Education 
Is Being Undermined." One cause of concern is the rising number 
of teachers leaving the profession each year, the overwhelming 
majority of them under 45 years of age. Of the 2,300 teachers in 
Shanghai who left the profession in 1993, 1,600, or 69 percent, 
were younger than 35 years old. A high 86.3 percent of the 
teachers in Tianjin who switched jobs were under 40 years of 
age. The second concern is that the problem tends to hit some 
areas and schools particularly hard. For the areas and schools 
affected, the result is nothing short of catastrophic. The 
exodus of teachers en masse is only part of the problem. Equally 
serious are the destabilizing effects their departure has on the 
ranks of the teaching profession. When the teaching force is 
demoralized, building up its ranks in the future becomes a 
daunting task. 
  When teachers' training institutions of all types have 
trouble recruiting students, the quality of basic education will 
suffer directly. As they say, "Without the skin, what can the 
hair cling to?" 
  Nationwide the demand for elementary and high school 
teachers 
generally shows an upward trend. In contrast teachers' training 
institutions, which produce teachers, are in decline in both 
their strength and their scale of development. In 1992, a banner 
year for institutions of higher education of all types, 
recruitments by general teachers' training colleges fell from 
296,400 a year ago to 276,100. Recruitments by teachers' 
training secondary schools also slipped, from 299,300 to 
278,900, including the large number of students recruited by 
teachers' training schools who do not major in education. 
  Under State Education Commission regulations, elementary and 
high school teachers must possess the appropriate academic 
qualifications. Specifically, senior high school teachers must 
be graduates of teachers' training colleges who have majored in 
education, while teachers at the junior high school and 
elementary school levels must be college graduates and graduates 
of special secondary schools, respectively. A teacher who 
entered the profession having gone through neither of these two 
routes is considered unqualified. However, he can qualify by 
passing an examination and earning a certificate. According to 
knowledgeable individuals in the teachers' training office under 
the State Education Commission, there were 8.66 million 
elementary and high school teachers in China as of late 1992. On 
average 53.7 percent of senior high school teachers were 
qualified, as were 60.2 percent of junior high school teachers 
and 90.6 percent of elementary school teachers. The average pass 
rate among elementary and high school teachers was 68.2 percent. 
In addition, the fact that knowledge becomes obsolete and 
teaching methods go out of date, along with other ills, is 
increasingly affecting the quality of the targets of education 
and widening the gap between education and practical needs. 
  President Zhang Yiwei [1728 0001 0251] of Petroleum 
University appealed to society at large to make investment in 
education a top priority. He said, "Our educational spending to 
date has not even reached the level of middle-ranking developing 
nations. These days people say that since we are trying to put 
together a market economy, inevitably education would take a 
beating. The fact of the matter is that the more we want a 
market economy, the greater the need to take education 
seriously. Certainly education itself needs to be reformed, but 
that will take time. Everything else can be imported; the only 
thing that cannot be imported is the quality of the people. We 
can only work to nurture it on this piece of land. This is such 
a basic point. If we ignore education, the result will be a 
poorly educated populace, which in turn will have adverse 
effects on material construction. Modernization is impossible 
without a high-caliber people." 
  People have always found this "besieged city" phenomenon 
most 
puzzling. Everybody knows that intellectuals have meager 
financial resources. Yet every parent works his guts out to 
provide an education for his children, hoping that they would 
grow up to be intellectuals. The individual householder may be 
awash in banknotes, but he pledges to his soul he would send his 
son to college. 
  Don't you feel that this is historical progress of sorts, a 
road history must travel? 
  Who will be the teachers in 21st-century China? In a certain 
sense, China's prosperity today and its rise or fall tomorrow 
ride on the answer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Deng Weizhi (6772 0251 1807), famous </F>
sociologist, and central committee vice chairman of and 
researcher at the China Association for Promoting Democracy; 
edited by Gu Chu (6253 0443): "An Academic Treatment of the Ten 
Relationships Among the People"] 
  [Text] As reform has intensified, opening has expanded, and 
interest groups have been adjusted, today's contradictions among 
the people have changed somewhat from those of pre-reform. An 
academic treatment of the old and new contradictions among the 
people is of direct concern to the stability and development of 
Chinese society. There are 10 major contradictions. 
  1. The CPC vs the non-CPC. The CPC is the ruling 
party, while the democratic parties (those bourgeois and 
petty-bourgeois political parties that have accepted the 
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and joined the 
revolutionary united front) are parties that participate in 
government and political affairs. If we see China as a large 
ship, then the captain is the CPC, with the rowers being the 
democratic parties, the people of all nationalities. If we 
take China as a solar system, then the CPC is the sun, with the 
democratic parties and the association of industry and commerce 
being the nine planets. But while "long-term coexistence" has 
been no problem, "mutual oversight" still needs reinforced. 
Mutual oversight is both a major function and a general 
guarantee of long-term coexistence. A few places are still 
subject to "treating each other as guests with mutual respect, 
while not speaking to each other face to face, but living in 
peace with each other." When speaking is necessary, some talk 
of health and tell jokes, with the words not to involve justice. 
Even when "justice is involved," it is mostly a repetition of 
adages and stereotypes. Some grass-roots people are "blind to 
the united front." We absolutely must not tolerate words or 
deeds of discrimination against the democratic parties. 
Meanwhile, the democratic parties must not stubbornly blame 
society for not knowing about them. Democratic figures should 
examine their consciences, asking themselves how many political 
views they have espoused that have thoughtfully contributed to 
strengthening the leadership of the party, and how many deeds 
they have done that have "knowledgeably" benefited the people. 
If things are to be done right, there must be no fear, but of 
course prevention, of overstepping of the bounds. In the 
history of the democratic parties, there have been almost no 
incidents of overstepping the bounds. In order to help, there 
must be no fear, but of course prevention, of adding to the 
confusion. 
  2. City dwellers vs peasants. As to the supply, 
demand, and prices of farm and sideline products in some places, 
there is a phenomenon of "city dwellers laughing when peasants 
jump, and peasants laughing when city dwellers jump." This is a 
case of contradiction between urban and rural areas, and the 
difference between industry and agriculture. Cheap grain 
prices harm agriculture, while high grain prices harm industry. 
All need to submit to the law of value for things to work out. 
Some areas are now experiencing a contradiction between 
takeover of arable land and expansion of cultivated area. 
Cultivated land is peasants' livelihood. On existing 
technological terms, higher per-unit yields are limited. So 
higher gross output means mainly dependence on expansion of 
cultivated area. Takeover of arable land means less gross 
output, lower peasant income, higher farm product prices, and 
thus increased spending by city dwellers. China is a country 
of large territory, little arable land, and many people. While 
we have exact plans for the hundreds of millions of jin of grain 
that we would like to produce by the year 2000, our population 
expansion means that we may not even have as much by then as we 
do now. The sharp drop in cultivated area will make it hard to 
avoid a day when we may have to tighten our belts. 
  3. Educational circles vs the business world. The 
educated are the holders of advanced knowledge, and the 
developers of advanced productive forces. The entrepreneurial 
stratum is just rising in China, with businessmen being the 
organizers and managers of our socialist economy. The relations 
between these two strata concern the fate of our nation. The 
educated are diving into the sea of business, while businessmen 
climb the shores of academia, showing the exchange between the 
two strata. Scholars are acquiring a stronger awareness of 
serving businessmen, while business support for education is 
growing. This shows the mutual appeal of these two strata. 
But business support for education is like flower arranging, 
not necessarily tree planting. Educational circles need to plant 
taller trees to attract more breezes. Educational circles and 
the business world need to form an alliance. And we need to 
raise this educational-business alliance to the level of our 
worker-peasant one. 
  4. Military vs civilian. The people supporting the 
army and the army cherishing the people, working together as one 
family, has been a glorious Chinese tradition for decades. With 
the little amount we can afford to spend on education, how could 
our military spending not experience difficulties. While our 
force has been cut, our military spending still needs to be 
higher. We need crack troops with good equipment. While mess 
standards are not high for college students, they are even lower 
for soldiers. Just as schools running enterprises is not a 
permanent solution, military-run tertiary industries are also an 
expedient measure. The crux of the matter is that both need to 
be done moderately, with all observing market laws. From an 
economic perspective, the poor compete to enlist in the army. 
This economic standing can then be conveniently converted to 
social standing. So the military and civilians are undergoing a 
mutual conversion, as well as being dependent on each other. 
  5. Rich vs poor. China's gap between rich and poor 
has begun to widen. The wealthy calculate their incomes in 
hundreds of millions, while the poor have annual incomes in the 
hundreds. While most of the wealthy get rich properly, some do 
so improperly. Poverty involves objective as well as subjective 
factors. The poor should not be jealous of the rich, just as 
the rich should not discriminate against the poor. The poor 
should trace the root cause of their poverty, and the rich ought 
to help the poor. The rich also have a problem of being very 
wealthy materially and spiritually, but poor educationally, 
which is in urgent need of solution. The order of "simple 
labor earning lots of money, while complicated work earns 
little," needs corrected quickly. The labor-remuneration 
"price relations" for various lines of work need to be rational. 
  6. Authorities vs subordinates. While 
authorities and subordinates are unanimous on goals and basic 
interests, they are still subject to contradictions. As 
China's political democracy advances, with increased freedom of 
speech, overt conflicts between upper and lower levels increase, 
while covert contradictions decrease. One of the foci of these 
conflicts is the phenomenon of corruption by some. In addition 
to the exchange of power for money, there is more public 
discussion about job and political corruption. As 
anti-corruption intensifies, people will reach a better 
consensus on the features, subjects, natures, and degrees of 
corruption, by which time an order of high unity among upper and 
lower levels will appear. 
  7. The old vs the young. Someone has discovered 
the fact that the difference in the study of problems is far 
smaller among various political parties than among differing age 
groups. This shows that there is certainly a generation gap 
between the old and the young. While this is the inevitable 
result of faster Science and technology, economic, social, and 
perceptual development, the gap is not unbridgeable. The 
relations between the old and the young are actually ones of 
tradition vs change. It needs pointed out that there is no 
change in the world divorced from tradition, as well as no 
unchanging tradition. While Confucianism has been discussed 
for millenia, there is actually noone who has not transformed 
it. While the generation gap seems to be a qualitative issue, 
it is actually mainly a quantitative one. As to rate of change, 
it is inevitable that the young will run ahead a little faster. 
The future of our country is in the hands of our young people, 
just as the future of our young people can be said to be old 
age. As all are subject to physiological and psychological 
ageing, the old and the young need to cooperate and supplement 
each other. 
  8. Theists vs atheists. Since the primitive 
beginnings of religion, theism has a million-year history. In 
the future, once classes and political parties have withered 
away, theism, as well as the need to propagandize atheism, will 
continue to exist. Laterally, religion in China affects dozens 
of nationalities and hundreds of millions of people. In 
addition, it also has an international relationship. As religion 
is culture, as well as social norms, it is reasonable that some 
areas have a low crime rate among believers. Atheists ought to 
respect the beliefs of theists. While all categories of cadres 
at all levels should have a little general knowledge about 
religion, some now lack this, often making fools of themselves 
and bringing on disaster. While those who secure rights in 
religious circles by force or trickery should be dealt with 
severely, theists also need to be understanding, forgiving, and 
tolerant about the lack of religious knowledge among some 
atheists. As understanding and tolerance are key items in many 
religious creeds, the more one is understanding, the more one is 
respected. Some publishing houses now turn pale at the mere 
mention of the word "religion," fearing that not dealing with it 
accurately will cause trouble, so delete all references to 
religious knowledge, which is actually adverse to its spread. 
  9. Coastal vs interior. China is made up of 
several dragons with their heads along the coast and their tails 
inland. Our coastal zones were opened up first and have 
developed a little faster, while our inland areas have a poor 
base and have developed a little slower. But the heads and 
tails have a common fate. When the heads are lifted, the tails 
raise up. The heads and tails are tied together by production 
relations. How high either the heads or the tails can be lifted 
depends on the role of the productive forces and overall 
national might. A dragon can do without neither a head or a 
tail, with the tail having a tail function, the waist a waist 
function, and the head, tail, and waist needing mutual 
attention. While it cannot be said that local protectionism 
should not be allowed to exist at all, with patriotism including 
love of one's native place, overdoing it shifts one's troubles 
onto others. Local conditions need concern for the overall 
situation. The more the center devolves authority to localities, 
the more conscious inter-local cooperation is needed, and the 
more all localities need to subordinate themselves to the 
center. China is a whole piece that cannot be divided. "The 
peacocks flying off to the southeast," with population flowing 
to the coast, has both pros and cons, but is more pro than con. 
The crux of the matter is that it needs to be controlled, with 
control of the flow rate, volume, and direction, to keep them 
orderly. As the relations between the coastal and interior 
areas are ones of urban vs rural and advanced vs backward, they 
need dealt with cautiously. 
  10. Mainland Chinese vs Taiwanese. Mainland 
China and Taiwan are two places in one country. Both sides 
have the same roots, which will sooner or later mature and 
intertwine their branches. As Taiwan has more money and the 
mainland has a large market, cooperation benefits both. 
Cooperation is invincible. As neighboring countries 
throughout the world make "treaties" and form "communities," how 
can we as one country remain divided into this side and that 
side? How can we go around in circles about our intercourse? 
It is time to "shake hands for the third time" and "greet each 
other with a smile." As the common people on both sides have 
long since claimed each other as kin, those at the higher level 
need to make faster, more, and all-out contacts. 
  All of these ten relationships are derivatives of the major 
contradiction between our peoples' ever-growing material and 
cultural needs and our backward productive forces. The goal of 
dividing them up for purposes of discussion is to resolve this 
major contradiction.

(4545 3219 2429); edited by Lu Jian (7120 0256): "What Are the 
Major Concerns of the Various Social Strata?"] 
  [Text] The Qiqihar Municipal Public Opinion Polling Office 
recently surveyed 1,125 residents from all walks of life. The 
makeup of the 1,125 polled residents was: 19 percent office 
workers, 15.9 percent; cultural and educational workers, and 
scientific researchers, 17.8 percent; commercial catering 
service workers, 38.2 percent; enterprise employees, 2.3 
percent; individual [industrial and commercial household] 
operators, and 6.8 percent others. Following are the 16 hot 
social topics listed in the questionnaire ranked by degree of 
concern: 
  Wage reform, 70.8 percent; public security [public order], 
65.7 percent; honest government [anti-corruption], 62 percent; 
social atmosphere [public climate], 60.8 percent; housing 
reform, 58.6 percent; children's education, 53.6 percent; 
social security, 51.8 percent; price reform, 49.2 percent; 
polarization between rich and poor, 45.6 percent; living 
conditions, 42.8 percent; structural reform, 41.2 percent; 
inflation, 39.8 percent; preservation of currency value, 37.4 
percent; jobs, 30.9 percent; real estate, 17.2 percent; stocks 
and securities, 5.7 percent. 
  The "hot topics" of more concern to office workers were: 1) 
honest government at 79.9 percent; 2) public order at 72.4 
percent; 3) social atmosphere at 69.6 percent; 4) housing reform 
at 67.3 percent. The "hot topics" of more concern to 
educational and cultural workers and scientific researchers in 
descending order were wage reform at 73.7 percent, children's 
education at 65.4 percent, and honest government at 59.8 
percent. Those of more concern to commercial catering service 
workers in descending order were wage reform at 85 percent, 
public order at 69.5 percent, social security at 65 percent, and 
honest government at 64.5 percent. For enterprise employees, 
this ranking was wage reform at 66.5 percent, public order at 
62.6 percent, social atmosphere at 60.2 percent, and housing 
reform at 60 percent. And for individual operators [the

<F P=106> [Article by Nan Sheng (5589 4563): "Retired Servicemen Hold </F>
Up Military Train for `Self-Salvation'"] 
  [Text] An official of the Beijing Municipal Civil 
Affairs Bureau said with heavy heart that given today's city and 
countryside employment difficulties, it is simply impossible to 
place millions of retired servicemen, and that this adds another 
"element of instability" in society. 
<H5>  Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps Attacks </H5>
  On the night of 5 January, a train headed from Xuzhou in 
Jiangsu Province to Hefei in Anhui Province entered Guzhen near 
Bengbu at high speed. Its markings showed it to be a military 
train that had to be given the right of way. Just then, the 
people's armed police escorting the train discovered that 
something was wrong up ahead. Two hundred people had suddenly 
appeared from out of nowhere, most of them young and strong 
lads. Each of them seemed to have been trained well. Within a 
very short time they took control of the military train. 
Carrying weapons, they engaged the people's armed police train 
escorts in a fire fight. These "train robbers" were completely 
fearless amidst the intense sound of rifle fire. While fighting, 
they organized others to haul away from the train light 
industrial products, household electrical appliances, 
motorcycles, etc. on trucks and horse carts. 
  The fire fight continued until 5:00 the next morning. 
Surprisingly, the people's armed police were unable to quell the 
disorderly band. The fight continued until the Bengbu garrison 
army received word and hurried to the scene where it encircled 
the gang and shouted in a loud voice: "Anyone who does not put 
his hands up will be shot on the spot!" After brief hand-to-hand 
combat, the army gained control of the situation. Only during 
the interrogation of the captured train robbers was it found 
that they were retired servicemen! 
  These retired servicemen and nearby villagers had long been 
eyeing the military trains that passed through the area. They 
carried out this robbery only after careful planning. After the 
event, it was learned from the Anhui Military Region that six 
cars of freight had been stolen, the losses running to more than 
1.8 million yuan. Three people's armed police had been killed, 
and 11 demobilized servicemen, who had taken part in the 
robbery, had also been killed. 
  Now the authorities are worried because these demobilized 
servicemen are not just a gang of desperadoes. In the winter of 
1992 they organized the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation 
Commando Corps consisting of more than 400 men divided into four 
groups for the purpose of intercepting military and civilian 
freight trains. They are active along railroad lines in Henan 
and Anhui provinces, and they have built temporary warehouses in 
mountainous areas along railroad lines. Each time they strike, 
they have a small contingent guard the base camp. 
<H5>  Retired Servicemen Add an Element of Social Instability </H5>
  These demobilized servicemen were once members of a favored 
group who have sunk into brigandage. Why did such a tremendous 
change occur? Official data show that more and more PLA 
personnel cannot be placed following discharge. In 1993 alone, 
500,000 people retired or were demobilized. This was the largest 
year for discharges since Deng Xiaoping decided on a 5 million 
force reduction in 1985. This retired army of 500,000, in 
addition to the number from previous years, produces no small 
pressure. An official in the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs 
Bureau said with heavy heart that given the current city and 
countryside employment difficulties, there is simply no way to 
place them. This adds an "element of instability" to society. 
  This is truly the case. By regulation, soldiers may return 
to 
the place at which they entered service, but the government is 
not responsible for providing them jobs. Many peasant lads who 
joined the armed forces to escape from farming find themselves 
back in their hometown "repairing the earth," so naturally they 
are unhappy. The term "self-salvation" in the name of the 
demobilized serviceman organization that robbed military trains, 
the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" should 
be underlined. 
  The local authorities are very concerned about this nasty 
case that has not yet been revealed in the media, fearing that 
"a single spark can light a prairie fire." Reportedly, the Anhui 
and Henan military sub-districts have assigned two battalions to 
work with the people's armed police on an investigation. They 
have issued a final ultimatum: All members of the "Anhui-Henan 
Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" must surrender their 
weapons and pilfered goods to the nearest garrison army or 
public security unit before 20 January. Those who fail to turn 
themselves in by that time, or who continue nefarious 
activities, shall be strictly punished according to law. 
Positively no mercy will be shown. 
<H5>  Retired Deputy Commander Also Takes Party </H5>
  One should not suppose that only ordinary soldiers take part 
in "self-salvation." Actually, military officers are involved. 
On 2 January, a train carrying military cargo from Guangzhou to 
Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was completely looted 
and set afire by more than 160 local demobilized servicemen near 
Ziyang, more than 100 kilometers from Chengdu. The Chengdu 
Military District dispatched a battalion of quick reaction 
troops to the scene. More than 140 demobilized servicemen were 
arrested, and 21 who refused to hand over their weapons and 
surrender were killed. 
  Astonishingly, interrogation found that the leader of the 
demobilized servicemen, a certain Zhou, had been deputy 
commander of the Zibo Municipal Garrison District in the 
Shandong Provincial Military District, holding the rank of 
lieutenant colonel. Zhou had been ordered to retire from 
military service and urged to resign from the Party in the 
autumn of 1992 for complicity in smuggling and corruption. After 
retirement, he become a section chief in the Ziyang County 
government. In former years, when a military officer transferred 
to a government organization in civilian life, he retained his 
former rank, salary, and special benefits. Nowadays, however, 
when government agencies everywhere have too many personnel, 
military officers have also become a burden that everyone pushes 
and shoves around. Since he had a lackluster military career, 
naturally Zhou had no standing. Disgruntled, he simply gathered 
together some colleagues from the old days for "self-salvation," 
styling himself as the "commander." Since disturbances organized 
by military personnel are more threatening than those organized 
by workers, peasants, or students, the Chinese Communists have 
resorted to strict repressive measures regarding this "element 
of instability." Reportedly, in the wake of the 2 January train 
robbery incident, Ziyang County and Neijiang Prefecture set up a 
special court, which quickly and severely tried and sentenced to 
death seven of the ringleaders. 
<H5>  "Serious Situation" on Nine Railroad Trunklines </H5>
  Nevertheless, the "quick and severe" sentencing to death of 
a 
number of ringleaders cannot solve the problem. Reportedly, the 
PLA is to cut 250,000 personnel. If so, tens of thousands of 
servicemen will take off their uniforms during the next two 
years to become individuals in the great army of the retired. 
They become another group that does not fit into the frenzied 
world of "everyone doing business." 
  In fact, "highwaymen" have become a plague on the mainland. 
The following figures illustrate the problem: During the 
second half of December 1993, the railroads termed the situation 
as "serious" on nine trunk line railroads and "fairly serious" 
on 35 branch line railroads. The nine trunk lines named as 
having a "serious situation" were the Beijing-Baotou, 
Xiangyang-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou, Chengdu-Kunming, 
Lanzhou-Qinghai, Xinjiang-Taiyuan, Guizhou-Kunming, 
Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Longhai lines

<F P=106> [Article by Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "Border </F>
Representatives Speak on How To Promote Border Stability and 
Prosperity"] 
  [Text] Since the opening of the second plenary session of 
the eighth Xinjiang autonomous region people's congress, troop 
border representatives spoke glowingly about the overall good 
situation of social stability and quick economic development in 
Xinjiang. Pooling the wisdom of the masses, everyone suggested 
ways and means to defend and construct the border and promote 
border stability and prosperity. 
  Representative Rosi Usul said border-stationed troops are 
the 
main strength protecting border stability. They undertake the 
glorious mission of providing a guarantee of safety for economic 
construction of the autonomous region. We must strive to 
enhance troop independence, inceasingly improve fighting 
strength, consolidate national defense, have a clear-cut stand 
opposing separatism and disorder, and firmly uphold the unity of 
the motherland and social stability. We must continue to do a 
good job of supporting the government and cherishing the people, 
and sustain and develop the overall good situation of Xinjiang's 
unified army and government, soldiers and civilians, and 
national minorities, "breathing together, having the same fate, 
heart to heart." 
  Yibulayin Sulaiman [0122 0008 2139 7299 5685 0171 3341], Hu 
Zongyao [5170 1350 1031] and other representatives who came from 
stations in the poor southern border areas believe that 
stationed troops have an unshirkable responsibility to promote 
the economic and cultural development of poor areas. In recent 
years, the southern border troops wholeheartedly worked for the 
masses. They help villages strengthen grass-roots party and 
government work, actively participate in public affairs, rush 
to emergencies, provide disaster relief, prevent and cure 
illnesses, plant trees and reforest, and contribute funds to 
help studies. They have input a great amount of human and 
material resources to train various technical personnel in 
stationed areas. 
  Represenative Li Laitong [2621 0171 7906] introduced various 
armed forces' successful methods of helping the poor in science 
and technology support. He suggested that in military areas 
troop support for the poor should be suited to the new 
conditions of market economics. In opening up and widening 
avenues to help the poor, we should gradually move towards a 
large scale of one village or town from one family or household 
and from purely supporting the poor with personnel or material 
aid to doing so with integrated personnel, finances, material, 
and science and technology. Improve the capacity of rural areas 
to move away from poverty to wealth on their own. 
  Representative Li Peidong [2621 1014 2767] from the border 
defense troops indicated that border defense troop PLA officers 
and men, garrisoned in lofty and snowy mountain ranges, 
struggling arduously and sacrificing unselfishly, resolutely 
create a good and safe social environment for the stable 
development of the autonomous region.

<F P=106> [Article by Lou Wanghao (2869 2598 4110): "Without Unity </F>
There Cannot Be Economic Development"] 
  [Text] While deliberating a government work report at the 
second plenary session of the eighth Xinjiang Autonomous Region 
people's congress, Uighur and Hasake national minority 
representatives who came from northwest of Tianshan discussed 
the matter of unity which is of concern to people of each 
national minority. They said there is no econmic development 
without unity. There is no stability without unity. Unity is 
the top concern of each of our national minorities. 
  The Uighur people's congress representative, mayor of Kashen 
City Ablat Mehmetjou, said that Xinjiang's development is 
inexplicably tied to the assistance of the Han nationality and 
other national minorities. The facts of Kashen's economic and 
cultural development fully prove the veracity of "two 
inseparables." Without the help of the Han nationality, there 
could not have been Kashen's present prosperity and flourishing 
state. From a historical perspective, the development of 
national minorities is inseparable from the help of the Han 
nationality; we especially need the aid of the Han in science 
and technology. Today in economic development work, we need the 
Han nationality's help even more. We hope and welcome even more 
Han comrades to come and work in Kashen. 
  Representatives of the Hasake nationality, Hadir, deputy 
secretary of the Aqintai area, and Kabul, chairman of the 
agriculture and animal husbandry committee of the Xinjiang 
autonomous region people's congress standing committee, should 
love and protect unity just as they love and protect their 
sight. Our national minorities' economic and cultural 
development can only be promoted if there is unity. For many 
years now the Aqintai area consistently has put unity work in 
first place. Our six counties and one city have become advanced 
model units of national minority unity, thus the entire area's 
economy and culture have swiftly developed and the people's 
livelihood has been rather greatly improved. 
  Maizuremu Yusupu [6314 4371 3583 2606 3768 4790 3940], 
people's congress representative of the Uzbek nationality, and 
Kamil Kurmaif, people's congress representative of the Tatar 
nationality, said that the key to improving the quality of the 
national minorities lies in improving their cultural education 
work. Considering our minorities, we fully appreciate cultural 
education. Many Uzbek and Tatar national minorities hope to 
engage in education work and thus the proportion of college 
students exceeds that of other minorities. We hope the 
government will energetically stress national minority general 
education work. Xinjiang's economic growth will have a solid 
foundation only if Xinjiang's various minorities are well 
educated. 
  Imam Haiguoen [3189 0948 1869], of Dayou village, Jimusaer 
[0679 2606 5646 1422] county mosque, a Muslim people's congress 
representative, said religious people must take the lead in 
being models of national minority unity. They should actively 
coordinate with the Party and the government to do a good job of 
nationality unity. Unity is a large framework that none can 
destroy. National minorities can truly attain development only 
in unity. I believe that Imam played an important role in 
national minority unity work.

<F P=106> [Article: "You Know and I Know; Only the Kuomintang Does Not </F>
Know"] 
  [Text] People used to joke that there are gambling halls 
everywhere and unlicensed brothels everywhere, and everybody 
knows it but the police in the areas where they are located. 
Today, this crack should be rewritten to read that every time 
there is an election, everyone knows who is offering gratuities, 
the amount of the gratuity, what is expected in return for the 
money, and who is a thug. The Kuomintang is the only one that 
does not know. 
  But how could it not know? Whenever a party official large 
or 
small states how "strong" his nominator is, that shows that the 
KMT has actually known for a long time. "Strong" is a special 
term used as a code word in Taiwan politics. When the KMT urges 
the withdrawal of an inexperienced young person, it says he or 
she "is not strong so how can he or she be elected." When the 
media analyze an election, they also rank candidates by who is 
and who is not "strong." When the election is won, everyone 
declares that the "strong" person won. The KMT is the "strong 
faction." In short, to be "strong" is to be like Chiang Kai-shek 
and Sun Yat-sen. If you are not "strong," how can you be 
elected? Take the present election of county and city assembly 
chairmen and vice-chairmen, for example. It was really extremely 
coincidental that before balloting all the assemblymen were 
surprisingly so wholehearted in their great interest in group 
tours for their constituents. But no one knew anything about 
this coincidence. Rubbish. 
  However, in Taiwan, hard evidence is important. Election 
bribery? Did anyone see a KMT candidate give money to anyone. 
Thugs? Did anyone see a KMT candidate shoot at another person? 
Since there is no hard evidence, naturally everything is 
considered mud slinging. What is more, from the very beginning 
of the election, the KMT repeatedly exhorted comrades against 
using bribery to get elected, against wining and dining people, 
against offering group tours to constituents, and against force 
and threats. Since it had be so emphartic, surely there would 
be no breaking of the rules. Even if some candidates did offer 
bribes, that was not the party's problem, but a problem with the 
social atmosphere. Dammit! What kind of logic is that! What 
makes one not know whether to laugh or cry is that it was the 
logic used in the 2 March KMT Standing Committee meeting. 
  Therefore, Taiwan's bribed elections have actually long been 
an incurable disease. It is not that the disease is so serious 
or a remedy so hard to find, but only the "not knowing." When 
everyone realizes that elections are sick, the KMT does not 
admit that anything is wrong. When everybody sees bribed 
elections and thuggery, the KMT does not know anything about it. 
It tells bare faced lies. Now, even were a remedy to be offered 
with the best of intentions, the KMT would not countenance it. 
  Bribed elections are not a difficult to cure disease. All 
that is needed is for a young candidate who has a good image, 
who is capable, and who is not "strong" to win once or twice, 
and the disease would be suddenly cured. Of course, to run for 
election without being "strong" means victory would not be 
assured. However, a good person might lose once, but he would 
not lose forever. Once a good person won, that would not be just 
a small win; it might bring a great, complete victory in its 
wake. 
  Are bribed elections difficult to cure? Not at all. All that 
is needed is to change the hearts of the party bureaucrats into 
the hearts of the common people. There is nothing to it!

<F P=106> [Interview arranged by Yang Ma-li (2799 3854 0448) and Liang </F>
Chung-wei (2733 0022 0251): "P'eng Ming-min: Hope To Bring 
Taiwan a Little Bit of Idealism"] 
  [Text] [Excerpts] From overseas critic to becoming 
someone who could compete for the presidency, former Taiwan 
University political department chairman P'eng Ming-min [1756 
2494 2404] in a special Tienhsia magazine interview 
relates the development of his thinking in the over a year that 
he has been back in Taiwan and his reflections on Taiwan's 
political situation. 
  Question: What are your impressions of Taiwan 
after being back over a year? 
  Answer: I feel that the whole society appears to 
be lawless. Whether in daily life or in the state of mind, or in 
achieving goals it appears that they can be unscrupulous. Also 
the whole society is pursuing money. Even the Democratic 
Progressive Party (DPP) by existing in the society cannot 
completely escape the influence of this social atmosphere. So, 
we say that the DPP is becoming more and more like the 
Kuomintang (KMT). When it was founded, the party was modeled on 
the KMT. It also has a central standing committee and the 
central standing committee meets on Wednesday. Even its policies 
are becoming closer and closer to those of the KMT. [passage 
omitted.] 
  Question: After you returned to the country, you 
went to several places helping in the election of DPP 
candidates. What did you learn from this? 
  Answer: All together I helped in the election of 
three public officials. I am not a member of the DPP, but I 
believe that if Taiwan democracy is to get on track, it is 
necessary to have a relatively strong opposition party. 
Following this thinking, I went everywhere to help in the 
election of DPP candidates. Naturally, I could not help those 
who were too lacking in image. I wanted to hear DPP audiences 
and I think that at first I was relatively supportive of the DPP 
and relatively interested in current events. The occasion were 
all very enthusiastic, it is just that I do not know how big a 
share of the people of the countryside they make up. 
  For example, the day that the campaign office for the 
reelection of Su Chen-ch'ang, the former county executive of 
P'ing-tung County, was established, more than 30,000 people 
participated. The scene was so enthusiastic, but he still was 
defeated. There also was the scene for Hua-lien's Ch'en 
Yung-hsing. I also went twice. The scene was very moving. There 
was a graduate of the chemical engineering department of Taiwan 
University in his forties who had never before participated in 
politics, but he ran up on the stage to help in Ch'en 
Yung-hsing's election. He spoke and really moved people. I also 
did not understand why Ch'en Yung-hsing later trailed the KMT 
candidate by more than 40,000 votes. I think vote buying could 
certainly have had an influence on the election. 
  There is nothing wrong with everyone's being enthusiastic 
about the election. The problem is that the election turned out 
this way. How many hundred million yuan must be spent to elect a 
legislator? This is twisted. What meaning is there to this kind 
of election? If Americans or Japanese heard that several hundred 
million had to be spent to elect a Taiwan legislator, they 
simply would have no way to imagine it. Moreover, this does not 
help democracy in the least. However, there is a saying, when 
things get their worst, they cannot get any worse, they can only 
turn around, there is no where to go. I hope that the benefits 
from vote buying will slowly diminish and ultimately no one will 
buy votes. 
  Also, there is Taiwan's county executive and mayoralty 
elections. Actually it is like TIENHSIA magazine pointed out 
last year in its article ("Behind County Executive and Mayoralty 
Elections---Contending To Grab Land Wealth," November Issue). It 
is to fight for municipal planning rights and making money by 
speculating on land. When I went to Tainan's Yung-k'ang County 
to help in the election, I heard that a candidate wanted to 
spend 1 billion. He certainly would be elected. I also heard 
that the mayor of a rather large city after he was elected 
looked for places to redo the municipal plan. In the 4 billion 
plan, the mayor himself would take 500 million. 
  Question: You have sacrificed and strived your 
whole life for Taiwan democracy. What are your feelings when you 
see these things? 
  Answer: I feel that it is very ironic and very 
distressing. Before I returned home, I was in contact with 
several friends who often went in and out of Taiwan and had a 
good understanding of Taiwan. They laughed at me and said, "Are 
the Taiwan people worth the sacrifice that you are making? If 
you went to see, you would know." Also once at a public lecture 
in Hawaii with an audience of 300 or 400, someone stood up and 
said that what I said was very right, very ideal, and very 
reasonable, but if you went back to Taiwan and said these 
things, everyone would laugh at you. He asked what kind of a 
society is Taiwan now? He said, if you did not yield on the 
road, the cars would crush you to death. Taiwan is a dog eat dog 
society. I had no way to reply to him. I said to him that this 
society still needs a fool saying some foolish things. 
  Taiwan is a society totally lacking in idealism. If you talk 
about ideals, people would say that this is because you do not 
understand reality. When I returned, I assumed it had a little 
bit of significance, if only to see if I could arouse some 
idealism. Talking this way people could think that I am too 
naive, but this is exactly what I think. Taiwan's frame of mind, 
character, and sentiments are all extremely low, and no one has 
the ability to reflect. It is as if they cannot stop and think 
and visualize themselves. Everything appears to be a sham. 
  Question: What should an ideal society be? 
  Answer: Democracy is one ideal, and establishing a 
clean, fair, just, and harmonious society also is an ideal. 
  The pursuit of ideals sounds very far off. For example, in 
pursuing democracy we will never reach perfection, but we can 
gradually improve on various defects and become a society that 
is a little less defective. American black people have already 
been free 100 or 200 years and discrimination against black 
people still has not been resolved, but it is generally much 
better than fifty or one hundred years ago. Kindergarten 
children have begun to have it instilled in them that they 
cannot discriminate on the basis of race. 
  Question: Taiwan has so many problems. Where do 
you think the greatest problem or the greatest challenge is? 
  Answer: I do not think that there is only one. I 
am not an expert in environmental protection or the economy, but 
both of these are very important. Taiwan's environmental 
protection problem is very serious. In Taiwan I am most 
concerned about food. We do not know if the vegetables and fish 
that we eat are safe or not. But the average person does not 
feel that the environmental protection issue is urgent. I 
recently saw a report that said that Asia's environmental 
pollution is the most serious, more serious than any place else. 
Someone has studied Thai children's intelligence quotients. 
Because of lead poisoning, they are at least four points lower 
than normal children. Taiwan also could have this problem. We 
should study it. I personally have always been interested in 
politics. If you ask me what is Taiwan's most important issue, I 
think that it is relations with the mainland. This involves our 
existence. [passage omitted.] 
  I am very concerned as regards our stand after the 
government 
and society have decided to persist in safeguarding our 
sovereignty. Have they thought it out extremely carefully? The 
Chinese Communist policy calling for unity and calling for one 
country, two systems could threaten the future existence of all 
Taiwan's residents. But what is Taiwan's policy toward the 
mainland? It would not threaten the Chinese Communists in the 
least. So, Taiwan must be extremely careful and deal with 
mainland relations cautiously. 
  What makes me extremely sad and uneasy is that even our 
leaders often say that wherever the Chinese Communists' bottom 
line is, we do not want to touch it, especially after they 
issued the Taiwan White Paper. But what I want to ask is, where 
is our bottom line? If we do not have a bottom line, forget 
about a clear-cut surrender. 
  In the past, Taiwan spent several hundreds of billions every 
year on national defense, and in the 1960s every year 80 percent 
of the national budget was invested in national defense, buying 
weapons and training a large army to fight the Chinese 
Communists. But now it appears that they have leapt to the other 
extreme. If they take a little action, they are afraid that the 
Chinese Communists will get angry. Do we not even have the 
capability to protect ourselves? Where did those large armies 
run off to? When a society's basic rights are threatened, 
including its sense of value, education and culture, economy, 
and life style, if it does not decide to rise to its own 
defense, this society is not qualified to exist. This is not 
favoring war, but no matter what this determination must be 
maintained. A country such as Finland only has a population of 4 
million, but when it stood up to defend itself and protect its 
religion, lifestyle, and concepts, even the Soviet Union had no 
choice. 
  What I would like to ask is why people now do not identify 
with this government and this place? The government's past style 
did not have public trust. Everything that they said was false 
and it caused people to become very cynical. As when they spoke 
for several decades about counterattacking the mainland, 
essentially no one believed it. As a result, it was one thing in 
public and another thing in private and they could not foster 
everyone's patriotism. 
  In January of this year before leaving the United States, I 
had a discussion with Taiwan overseas students. They said that 
from the time that they were small, at home they heard about 
engineering fraud cases. They were used to hearing it and 
believed that it was true, but they would not get indignant. 
They only asked if they could profit to some extent from it. 
They did not have a concept of right and wrong. 
  Question: So, how should it be improved? Where 
will the way out for Taiwan be? 
  Answer: Everyone says that we should begin with 
national education, and I agree. But the biggest problem is that 
Taiwan does not have idealism. National leaders should no longer 
engage in factional struggles, but they should arouse ideals. 
National goals should be determined, whether they are democracy, 
fairness, or cleanliness, you should make people feel that you 
are doing something real and that leaders really mean this in 
reforming the mood of society. They speak this way now, but they 
do not have public confidence. No one believes them. They think 
that they are speaking slogans. Perhaps President Lee Teng-hui 
is too busy with many problems, but he should emphasize it more. 
  For example, the government speaks publicly against using 
bribery to win elections, but in fact all the KMT candidates buy 
votes. When they are nominated, they also look to see how much 
money they have. If the upper echelon leaders speak, but do not 
act, the common people can see it. 
  It is as if no one can see hope, even the DPP are about the 
same. Unless a group has a great deal of determination, it will 
be influenced by the mood of society. The DPP themselves also 
acknowledge that they have been greatly influenced by the mood 
of society and are slowly losing their idealism. 
  Question: So, what should everyone do? Where is 
Taiwan's future? 
  Answer: Actually every problem by no means has a 
specific cure, and my thinking about Taiwan's future is no 
secret. First we must preserve Taiwan's present sovereignty and 
seek the most suitable method to get along with the Chinese 
Communists. I am not so pessimistic on this point. 
  [Passage omitted.] 
  There also is what I call "the externally oriented economy 
and the internally oriented politics." The economy develops 
externally and politics should not always be entangled with the 
Chinese Communists. We should spare no effort to improve on 
internal politics and systems. Internal improvement also is an 
assurance for Taiwan and lets the whole world see improvements 
in Taiwan living standard, society, and government based on the 
will of the people. 
  Question: Is the present government not already 
based on the will of the people? 
  Answer: What we should ask about is not form, but 
content. In form we have elections, but what kind of elections? 
How much does it cost to elect a legislator? In the United 
States or Japan it would be unimaginable. There also are a great 
many landed people who even get involved in the election to 
protect their own land. 
  There also is the question of what the government of the 
"Republic of China" indicates. Does it still include the 
mainland and Outer Mongolia? A government must have a clear 
definition. We should pursue a truly fair, open, and clean 
society. This is our bottom line. It is not a national flag and 
it is not the issue of a name. In its system the government 
should do a great many things. Whether the president is directly 
elected or not is not necessarily the most important. Besides 
ideals there are several more practical and realistic issues. 
  Question: How do you place your own role? Will you 
get directly involved in politics or not? 
  Answer: I study politics and criticize from a 
political perspective. I do not necessarily want to directly 
participate in political activities. My foundation has just been 
established. Later we can conduct some more scholarly symposia. 
As most symposia now generally seek mostly famous people to come 
and talk, they very seldom ask young people to come and express 
their views on the mainland issue, and environmental protection 
and women's issues. So, I intend to ask many more of these young 
people to come and talk about what they think after all. 
  Question: Since the break up of the Soviet Union, 
United States-Japanese relations have changed and relations with 
the mainland also have changed. What opportunities does Taiwan 
have in this kind of situation? Is this beneficial to Taiwan or 
not? [passage omitted.] 
  Answer: In the present world the most important 
issue still is the economy. No matter what Taiwan's politics are 
like, how much status it has internationally completely depends 
on economics. The government must give absolute priority to 
economics and use economics to lead politics. How do we continue 
to develop the economy? Do we have this kind of power or can we 
play some role between the United States and Japan? A policy 
such as the southern orientation should have been promoted early 
on. We should not concentrate all of our investment in the 
mainland. Although I suspect that it is a little late to promote 
it now, it is still good. 
  Question: Might you come out and run for president? 
  Answer: I am still evaluating and considering 
that. If I really want to come out, I will need a great deal of 
courage, to pay a big price, and even have a spirit of 
sacrifice. But no matter what, I must make people feel that a 
new era has begun with a completely different way of doing 
things than in the past. The important thing for me to consider 
now is whether I have this capability to change society. The KMT 
president still is doing rather well. It will still be very hard 
for the opposition party president to do, even if he is elected. 
But basically I still feel rather comfortable being a scholar.

<F P=106> [Article by Ma Jiali (7456 0502 0500): "Post-Cold War Era </F>
India's Relations With China"] 
  [Text] Enormous changes have occurred in the international 
situation in recent years. A post-Cold War era, in which a 
multi-polar trend is an important mark, has begun. How to regard 
the effect of the post-Cold War era on India's foreign policy, 
what opportunities and challenges the post-Cold War era offers 
for India's China policy, and what the trend of development of 
India's relations with China will be are all questions meriting 
diligent study. 
<H8>  I </H8>
  With the end of the Cold War, very many changes have 
occurred 
in many factors affecting India's foreign policy, particularly 
its China policy. 
  (1) No Revival of the Special Relationship Between 
India and the USSR (Russia). For a long time, India used 
the strategic confrontation between the United States and the 
USSR, as well as the serious antagonisms between the USSR and 
China to build a special relationship with the USSR that 
encompassed the political, economic, military, and security 
areas. Following dissolution of the USSR, a great easing in 
relations between Russia and the United States, and maintenance 
of normal relations between Russia and China, bilateral 
political relations between India and Russia began to cool, 
economic and trade relations declined severely, and the buying 
and selling of arms virtually halted for a period. During a 
visit to India in January 1993, Boris Yeltsin said openly, "Past 
relations between the USSR and India had a marked coloration of 
joint opposition to the United States and China. Today, all that 
has passed." India, 70 percent of whose conventional weapons 
came from the former USSR, is now urgently waiting for Russia 
and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries to supply 
spare parts. However, how to pay the hard currency that Russia 
wants is an extraordinarily difficult problem for India, which 
is extremely short of foreign exchange. On the issue of Russia's 
selling low-temperature rocket launchers to India, for a time, 
Russia suspended contracts for selling and transferring 
technology to India in response to U.S. pressure. Later on, 
though it decided to sell the rocket launchers, Russia did not 
honor its contract for the transfer of technology, thereby 
arousing intense Indian dissatisfaction. This fully shows a 
decline in India's stature on Russia's diplomatic chessboard. 
India has no choice but to re-evaluate its strategy toward other 
countries, and readjust its outmoded foreign policy, including 
improvement of relations with China. 
  (2) India Both Improves Relations With the United 
States and Also Must Counter American Pressures. With the 
end of the Cold War, India decided to improve its relations with 
the United States because of its own strategic interest. India 
figured that vigorous strengthening of India-U.S. relations 
could effectively contain its adversary, Pakistan; reduce its 
own defense pressures; win American investment and assistance; 
and improve its own international standing. To this end, India 
took some strong actions and made some gestures for drawing 
close to the United States. In the economic field, for example, 
it steadily reduced policy restraints, widened the degree of 
economic liberalization, made efforts to open markets, and 
improved the investment climate. In the military field, it also 
began to build a cooperative relationship with the United 
States. However, because of different Indian and American 
strategic interests, conflicts and frictions continued between 
both sides on many important issues. With the end of the Cold 
War, the United States became the world's only super power. 
Impelled by its "strategy of expansion, and relying on its 
powerful position, it flagrantly meddled in the affairs of other 
countries, frequently applying embargoes in an effort to forces 
the countries concerned to act according to its will." Out of 
concern for its own strategic interests, the United States 
pressured India on the prevention of nuclear and missile 
proliferation issues, and on the human rights and intellectual 
property issues. Under these circumstances, India's improvement 
and strengthening of relations with China could improve its 
position for dealing with the United States, giving it more 
diplomatic leeway. 
  (3) Changes in the Non-Aligned Movement Position and 
India's Role. India has always made the nonaligned movement an 
important mainstay of its diplomatic activity, in negotiating 
between the United States and the USSR, and in maneuvering among 
political groupings to achieve the goal of using contradictions 
for its own benefit, and gaining advantages from both sides. 
From the time of its birth in 1961 until the present day, the 
nonaligned movement has developed into a quite influential 
international political force of more than 100 nations. India 
was one of the non-aligned movement's founding nations. Its 
distinctive position and its important role in the movement has 
received wide attention from international society. 
Consequently, India has benefitted greatly. However, the 
non-aligned movement was a product of the United States-USSR 
confrontation era. After the post-Cold War era, its premises 
changed enormously. Fairly early on, the non-aligned movement 
paid attention largely to economic development issues, but in 
recent years, Indonesia has consistently chaired it, so 
conditions for India to gain diplomatic advantage through the 
non-aligned movement have changed. In addition, during the 
post-Cold War era, the stature and role of the United Nations 
has risen. China is a permanent member of the Security Council, 
has very good relations with numerous non-aligned nations, is a 
non-aligned movement observer, and has very great power to 
influence numerous major international issues such as the new 
international political and economic order, and United Nations 
Security Council reform. Under these circumstances, improvement 
of relations with China, expansion of bilateral cooperation on 
international issues, and gaining China's support for India's 
becoming a permanent member of the Security Council to increase 
its international standing are the main considerations in 
China's further improvement and strengthening of relations with 
China. 
  (4) Increasing Competition in Overall National 
Strength. Following the end of the Cold War, India made 
vigorous development of its economy the main goal of its 
national strategy. It is already profoundly aware of the 
following as a result of the Cold War and its aftermath: a 
nation's existence and development, and its standing and role in 
the world are determined largely by its overall national 
strength. Moreover, the most important factor in overall 
national strength is economic strength. Only when a country has 
great economic strength in being can it occupy a fairly leading 
position in the contest for overall national strength, and only 
then can it have a stronger position and gain the right to speak 
out on international affairs. This being the case, India's task 
is how better to remain on top of changes in the situation, 
create a peaceful and stable surrounding environment, do all 
possible to promote economic growth, and raise the standard of 
living of its people. In order to do this, India has given 
improvement of India-China relations a fairly high priority on 
its diplomatic agenda. It desires to use improved India-China 
relations to ease the tense situation on the India-China border 
in order to cut back on military outlays for defense in its 
north. In addition, economically, it has further opened the door 
for trade and technical cooperation with China. Borrowing from 
China's experience and lessons in reform and opening to the 
outside world enables India smooth performance of the economic 
reform now underway in India. 
<H8>  II </H8>
  Favorable conditions and a reliable basis exist for the 
improvement and strengthening of relations between India and 
China. 
  (1) The Position of Both Parties Is Close on Quite a 
Few Regional and International Issues, and the Common Ground Is 
Increasing. Both India and China hope that the south Asia 
region will become increasingly peaceful, stable, and 
prosperous. They hope that the nations concerned will resolve 
problems existing in bilateral relationships through discussion 
and negotiations. They hope that south Asia regional cooperative 
alliances will develop further, and that substantive 
breakthroughs will be scored in promoting regional economic 
progress and raising the people's standard of living. 
  India and China speak a common language on many issues 
including the building of new international political and 
economic order following the Cold War, north-south relations, 
human rights, and environmental protection. Both India and China 
oppose hegemony, oppose power politics, and oppose domination of 
the world and issuance of orders to other countries by a single 
or a small number of nations. Both India and China believe that 
the five principles of peaceful co-existence are the standard 
for handling relations between one nation and another, and 
should be used as a foundation for building a new post-Cold War 
international order. On the human rights issue, both sides 
believe that the right to develop is an important aspect of 
human rights, and that human rights are a matter legally within 
the purview of a nation's sovereignty. Both sides oppose a small 
number of western nations use of human rights as a pretext for 
meddling in internal affairs, and they do not approve of certain 
western nations use of economic assistance as a means of 
exerting pressure on developing nations. Both parties have 
reached agreement in discussions on human rights issues in the 
forums concerned, and they have several times foiled the 
intentions of certain western countries to use human rights to 
meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. 
  (2) Steady Advances Have Been Made on Bilateral 
Relations Thanks to the Joint Efforts of the Governments of Both 
Nations. Politically, following the visits of Rajiv Ghandi 
to China and Premier Li Peng's visit to India, in September 1993 
Indian Premier Rao made a successful visit to China. This was an 
important chapter in the history of relations between the two 
nations that is bound to produce a profound and far reaching 
effect on exchanges and cooperation in the political, economic, 
cultural, and other fields. During Rao's visit to China, India 
and China formally signed Agreement on Maintenance of 
Peace and Tranquility in the India-China Border Actual Control 
Line Area, together with three other documents, namely: 
Cooperative Agreement Between the Indian Ministry of News 
Broadcasting and the Chinese Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and 
Television, Agreement Between the Governments of India and China 
on Environmental Cooperation,and Protocol Between the 
Governments of India and China on Widening Border Trade on Both 
Sides of Shibuqila [phonetic] Pass. 
  The Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility 
in the India-China Border Actual Control Line Area provides 
that India-China border problems shall be discussed and resolved 
through peaceful and friendly means, neither side using weapons 
or threatening the use of weapons against each other. Until such 
time as both nations resolve border problems, both sides shall 
strictly respect and observe the actual line of control between 
both parties. Both sides shall maintain its military forces at 
the minimum level in the actual control line areas to improve 
chances for the steady development of neighborly and friendly 
relations between the two nations. This agreement is bound to 
improve further the political atmosphere for India-China 
relations and create favorable conditions for ultimate 
resolution of border problems. Actually, both nations are taking 
actions in the border area to build confidence. Although some 
issues require further discussion, a very good beginning has 
certainly been made. That the Indian and Chinese armies have 
begun to build a relationship with each other has attracted 
attention. This is greatly beneficial for improving bilateral 
understanding and increasing mutual confidence. Not long ago, 
diplomatic and military expert teams from both sides held 
discussion on both nation's reducing the size of military forces 
garrisoning the border, and demarcating a control line in 
contested areas in which certain progress was made. Both sides 
expressed a desire to adopt a constructive attitude about the 
handling of border problems. 
  Economically, India is a large nation with a 
population of nearly 900 million, which is in the process of 
pursuing a new economic policy in an effort to change quickly 
its impoverished and backward circumstances. Improvement of 
economic and trade relations with China is a universal desire of 
Indian industrialists and businessmen. Some advances have been 
made in economic relations between India and China in recent 
years, but far from the amount befitting the economic size and 
potential of the two nations. In 1993, bilateral trade between 
the two nations increased to $675 million. This is a heartening 
advance, but still far from enough. A very great potential 
remains. 
  In addition, border peoples on both sides of the India-China 
border yearn for further development of border trade. Although 
some progress has been made on bilateral border trade, it still 
does not meet needs. Foreseeably, with further improvement of 
relations between the two nations, China and India will open up 
more trade channels in a steady expansion of the amount of 
border trade. 
  In the realm of scientific and technical 
cooperation, India's peaceful uses of atomic energy 
technology, agricultural technology, genetic engineering, and 
computer technology -- particularly software development 
technology and marine development technology -- have attracted 
the interest of China. China's small blast furnace technology, 
small hydropower technology, and space technology have 
benefitted India. By making use of the strengths of each other 
to remedy weaknesses, and by cooperating with each other in 
these regards, both sides can speed up development of their own 
economy, reduce technological dependence on other nations, and 
help make relations between both nations more mature and solid. 
Currently, the two nations have begin technical cooperation in 
the fields of agriculture, biological engineering, and 
metallurgy. 
<H8>  III </H8>
  It cannot be denied that further development of India-China 
relations requires further efforts to overcome some obstacles 
and difficulties. 
  India still harbors some apprehensions about China. The 
first 
apprehension is that China's might and its rise as a political 
force may damage India's national security. Retired Indian 
General Sharma said that despite the steady increase in 
diplomatic and cultural exchanges between India and China, one 
certainly could not belittle the "latent threat" from China. 
India still feels that a nuclear-armed China poses a serious 
challenge to its security. Actually, China's national strategy 
rests on the five principles of peaceful co-existence that China 
and India jointly espouse, and on the development of friendly 
relations with all nations. India is a developing country, and 
it is also a neighbor. More than that, it is a nation with whom 
China emphasizes the development of friendly relations. Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping said long ago: "A Chinese threat to India does not 
exist, nor does an Indian threat to China exist. We hope the we 
will develop, and we hope that you will develop too." Both 
China's and India's increase in strength will make a greater 
contribution to Asia and world peace and stability. China is a 
nuclear nation, but when China exploded its first atom bomb, it 
clearly promised never to be first to use nuclear weapons, and 
never to use or threaten use of nuclear weapons against a 
non-nuclear nation and non-nuclear territory. China lives up to 
its promises to the letter, and it has always striven to for a 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons in order to prevent 
nuclear proliferation. 
  Another Indian apprehension about China is the fear that 
development of relations between China an Pakistan may impair 
India-China relations. The truth is that because of the long, 
effective cooperation between China and Pakistan on political, 
economic, and international issues, friendly relations have 
steadily developed between the two nations. China has great 
regard for Pakistan as a friend deserving of trust, while, at 
the same time, China also highly regards its relationship with 
India. China hopes that Sino-Indian, Sino-Pakistani, and 
Indian-Pakistani relations will develop simultaneously in a 
benign cycle. China earnestly hopes that India and Pakistan will 
negotiate and parlay to reach a satisfactory solution to the 
problems existing in their bilateral relations, will change the 
low-intensity warfare that exists in the Kashmir region, and 
will gradually ease tensions. Not only is this in the interests 
of both India and Pakistan, but also in the interest of peace 
and stability in Asia. 
  At the same time, some problems may impair India-China 
relations. Examples include China's concern about the activities 
to split up the motherland that some Tibetans conduct in India. 
China endorses the enduring and consistent position that the 
Indian government has announced, namely that Tibet is an 
autonomous region of China, and that it will not permit the 
Dalai Lama clique to conduct activities in India in opposition 
to the Chinese rule. In reality, however, there are some 
people in Indian society who support actions by the Dalai Lama 
clique to split the motherland. They seek to make Tibet a buffer 
zone between India and China. This can only serve to arouse 
vigilance on the part of China. 
  To summarize the foregoing, despite the existence of some 
problems between India and China, both sides must further 
increase understanding and confidence, and satisfactorily handle 
and solve them. However, a further expansion of economic, trade, 
scientific and technical, and cultural relations, a great easing 
of the confrontation in the military area, further abatement in 
the border situation, and increased international cooperation 
between India and China may be foreseen. Greater cooperation 
between India and China is consistent with the post-Cold War 
historical tide, and it is consistent with the common interests 
of the people of both nations. Both India and China are large 
countries whose total population is close to 2.2 billion. They 
deserve to play a greater role on the world stage. Prospects are 
extremely broad for an increase in mutual cooperation between 
the two countries in building their own country and establishing 
a new international order.

<F P=106> [Article by Shen Wen (3947 2429): "Kampuchea--the Next </F>
Investment Hot Spot?"] 
  [Text] In 1993 there was an historical change in the 
Kampuchean situation. The establishment of a united government 
implies that Kampuchea entered a new era of peaceful 
reconstruction. 
  In more than two decades of war chaos, Kampuchea's numerous 
industries withered and the masses live in dire poverty. The 
economic base is entirely weak and it will still take a 
relatively long time to recover pre-war levels. Although this is 
the case, many people still harbor full confidence that 
Kampuchea's economy will recover as soon as possible. Some Asian 
businessmen and investors are sending troops to the Kampuchean 
market. Singapore had a rather early start in investment in 
Kampuchea. As early as 1987, with government auth ority 
Singaporean businessmen began business with some private 
companies which had special permission from the former Phnom 
Penh government. By the first half of 1991, Singapore had 
replaced the former Soviet Union to become Kampuchea's largest 
trade partner; bilateral Singaporean-Kampuchean trade reached 
S$330 million, up 38.5 percent over 1990. Singapore exports to 
Kampuchea petroleum, automobiles, beverages, machinery and 
electrical products. Kampuchea sells to Singapore rubber, wood, 
dried fish and rattan products. At present the most luxurious 
four-star hotel in Phnom Penh, the Jin Baodian Hotel, is a joint 
venture of a private Singaporean company and the Kampuchean 
government tourism bureau. It officially opened in 1991 with an 
investment of S$40 million [Singapore dollars]. Thailand is 
Kampuchea's greatest investor. Thai businessmen were among the 
earliest to send troops to Kampuchean markets under the Thai 
government's strategic policy of encouraging "transformation of 
Indochina's battlefields into commercial markets." 
Kampuchean-Thai border trade began as early as the early 1980s, 
and by the end of the decade the area became Kampuchea's most 
open and free border trade area. In 1988 Thai-Kampuchean 
bilateral trade was only $600,000. In 1991 it was $16 million. 
In 1992 it leapt to $160 million, a nine-fold increase. In the 
first quarter of 1993, bilateral trade was $183 million. Among 
Kampuchea's foreign investors, Thai businessmen head the list. 
Through the end of 1993, Thai enterprises invested in Kampuchea 
10 billion baht (approximately $400 million). According to 
official Kampuchean statistics, between 1989 and April 1992, 
when the former Phnom Penh government promulgated foreign 
investment laws, 79 of 300 approved foreign investment projects 
were from Thailand, or 26.3 percent. At present there are 
approximately 43 Thai companies investing in plants in 
Kampuchea. Japan is another of Kampuchea's most important 
investors. Japanese businessmen are very interested in 
Kampuchea's abundant forests. At present Kampuchea's largest 
wood product processing plant was jointly built by Japan and 
Kampuchea's ministry of agriculture at an investment of $5.5 
million; annual wood output is 100,000 cubic meters. In recent 
years, Japanese-Kampuchean bilateral trade has rapidly 
increased, of which, Japanese exports to Kampuchea have 
increased particularly fast. In 1990, Japan's total commodity 
exports to Kampuchea were $5 million; increasing to $7 million 
in 1991, and jumped to $230 million in 1992, a more than 31-fold 
increase. Hong Kong businessmen are relatively keen to set up 
hotels and restuarants in Kampuchea. Hong Kong trade with 
Kampuchea is primarily en trepot; motorcycles and industrial 
machinery are the main export commodities. In 1992, Hong Kong's 
gross exports were at HK $170 million, a more than triple 
increase over 1991; imports from Kampuchea totalled HK$4.42 
million, up 1.8 times over 1991. Through April 1992, there were 
59 projects in Kampuchea using Hong Kong investment capital, or 
20 percent of all of Kampuchea's foreign investment. In 
addition, France is striving to return to Kampuchea. French 
businessmen deal mainly in food products, tobacco, alcohol and 
clothing. In 1991, French-Kampuchean bilateral trade was at $7 
million; by 1992, it increased to $16 million. French companies 
anticipated the return of King Sihanouk at the end of 1991, and 
contracted to repair the palace. They also undertook printing 
new Kampuchean currency. Through April 1992, French capital was 
invested in 61 Kampuchean projects, or 20.3 percent of all 
foreign investment projects. One businessmen after another from 
other western and eastern alliance countries and regions and 
Taiwan have gone to Kampuchea to study investment and trade 
there, although very few have succeeded. Studying the reasons, 
besides a still unstable political situation and overly backward 
infrastructure, the Kampuchean government has too many and too 
strict constraints on foreign investment. For example, it 
stipulates foreign investors shall not engage in independent 
trade. Foreigners are not permitted to engage independently in 
real estate or most construction projects. The government also 
stipulates a 15 percent mandatory tax on repatriated surplus 
profits on foreign investments in Kampuchea. According to 
official Kampuchean information, more than 30 foreign investment 
banks have been allowed to be established, although only 18 
really have gone into operation since there now is no clear 
economic recovery. Furthermore, the banking industry only 
transfers accounts, has cash accounts or opens letters of 
credit. Temporarily, permission has not been given for credit 
financing. 
  In sum, Kampuchea is an attractive market, but people are 
still waiting to see whether it can become a new Southeast Asian 
investment hot spot.

<F P=106> [Article by Xu Jianbing (1776 1017 0393): "Public Ownership </F>
Does Not Mean the Public Owns Nothing"] 
  [Text] There are repeated discussions now regarding 
enterprises owned by the whole people. It is commonly said that 
their efficiency is low and they lack vitality. There are two 
kinds of sides. The majority hopes that deeper reform will make 
enterprises owned by the whole people develop prosperously 
because they recognize that such enterprises are the backbone of 
socialism. It goes without saying that, without this 
backbone--the mansion of socialist modernization, a small room 
or even a tent could not be raised. However, in society there 
also is a minority of people, some of whom have been affected by 
public opinion, others who stack up bills (including foreign 
currency) to put in banks or safety deposit boxes for future 
private development. Still others originally had an antagonistic 
attitude towards socialism, thus they do their utmost to slander 
ownership by the whole people. These people either thoroughly 
wreck ownership by the whole people or else they swallowed 
sleeping pills and cannot be awakened. 
  On 15 December 93, the "Wide Angle," a special 50th edition 
of JINGJI RIBAO, printed an article entitled "Ownership by All = 
Ownership by None." Even without reading the contents, the title 
tells the author's intent. 
  In relating the reasoning as to why "ownership by all = 
ownership by none," use is made of one of Hegel's phrases, 
"absolute brightness equals absolute darkness." This proves the 
author's partiality towards Hegel's "absolutist concept," but 
unfortunately, although Hegel was a master dialectician, he was 
ultimately an idealist. His philosophy is immersed with an 
absolute idealist system. That author's "ownership by all = 
ownership by none" namely is that absolute ownership is equal to 
absolute non-owner ship. However, through motion changes, the 
internal contradiction in Hegel's "absolutist concept" naturally 
will turn to face this elevated idealist principle applied 
mechanistically. Marxists will not approve of Hegel's 
"absolutist concept." The author's mechanistic use also is an 
arrow shot at nothing. Moreover, Hegel's philosophy and China's 
present economic system are totally unrelated. Slapping the two 
together does not illustrate the author's erudition. 
  The author's article in JINGJI RIBAO naturally is not a 
simple attempt to express himself as a follower of Hegel but one 
to mix ideologies, ultimately getting rid of the economy owned 
by the whole people so as to be able to attain his goal of 
ownership by noone. However, unfortunately, the author just 
talks nonsense and has not even grasped the connotation of 
ownership by the whole people. 
  After the entire country was liberated, we did not accept 
the 
Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital or imperialist, feudalist 
property, turning it into ownership by the whole people. Via 
three great socialist transformations, the majority of private 
capital-run enterprises became joint public and private 
operations and then were owned by the whole people. These 
economies owned by the whole people are the state's most 
important sources of finance. Their proportions of total 
financial income were, 1950, 33.4 percent; 1952, up to 58.1 
percent; 1953-1957, the First Five-Year Plan, approached 70 
percent; during the "Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Five-Year 
Plans," more than 85 percent; and from 1981-1985, during the 
Sixth Five-Year Plan, they fell to around 78.2 percent (above 
figures from DANGDAI ZHONGGUO CAIZHENG [CONTEMPORARY CHINESE 
FINANCE], Volume 2). The several trillion yuan turned over by 
enterprises or units in the ownership by the whole people system 
were not actually divied up to all the masses but all were used 
for economic construction, social and cultural education, 
national defense, administrative controls, and so on. Even 
primary school students all know that China's economy, culture, 
education, science and technology and military affairs, not to 
mention socialist construction, could not have developed without 
them and might have thoroughly collapsed. At that time, China 
really was about to become a society "where all had nothing"; 
China could only have become a land of foreigners. Therefore, we 
offer advice to Hegel's follower: It is better to begin with 
common sense. Taking a famous person's idealist few words to 
cheat ourselves and others is useless. The author said, "What is 
the result of everyone having rights to state property? No one 
is truly responsible." Where does such talk come from? An 
enterprise's party committee secretary or chief must be 
responsible for state property, for the workers of his own 
plant, and be responsible to the state and the law. There may be 
some party committee secretaries or chiefs who have lost their 
positions and caused losses to state property, but this is not 
equivalent to no one being responsible for state property in all 
enterprises. According to the author's view, it will not do for 
"everyone to have authority." It will only be fine if state 
property is given to individuals in private ownership. 
Therefore, the view taken by this author actually is a kind of 
privatization theory which existed as early as several years ago. 
  To clarify a point, big mistakes were made in our past 
economic work. Regarding financial expense allocation, there 
were some errors or shortcomings but they were of no direct 
relationship to implementing a system of ownership by the whole 
people. Steadfast opposition to implementing and protecting a 
system of ownership by the whole people essentially is 
opposition to implementing and protecting socialism. At a deeper 
level, it also is opposition to our regime which we seized from 
reactionary rulers in China to destroy imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucratic capitalism, bullying and oppressing the 
people's power and their property. The road which such 
opposition could take is exceedingly clear.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Puyou (2621 2528 2589), vice minister of the </F>
State Nationalities Affairs Commission: "Nationality Propaganda 
To Help Solve Minority Problems"] 
  [Text] Nationality propaganda work is an important part of 
the party's propaganda work as well as a key component of 
nationality work. 
  Nationality propaganda work must be guided by the principles 
underlying the party's propaganda work and carried out in 
conjunction with the reality in minority-inhabited areas and the 
conditions of minorities. Nationality propaganda work shares 
some common features with the party's other propaganda work but 
also has its own special content and characteristics. In 
nationality propaganda work, therefore, we must neither deviate 
from the party's propaganda work as a whole nor overlook the 
special content and characteristics of this particular kind of 
propaganda work. Only by integrating the two closely can we put 
nationality propaganda work on a sound footing. 
  We must steadfastly publicize the Marxist view on minority 
nationalities and the party's nationalities policy and religious 
policy, paying special attention to the "Regional National 
Autonomy Law." Autonomy in regions inhabited by minorities is 
the product of the marriage between basic Marxist tenets and the 
reality in China and a great achievement of the CPC. Practice 
proves that autonomy in minority-inhabited areas is consistent 
with the circumstances in China, has withstood any test, and has 
been embraced by the people of all nationalities in China. At a 
time when nationalism is on the rise in some places in the 
world, causing endless wars and turmoil, minority regions in 
China are politically and socially stable and enjoy steady 
economic growth. This fully demonstrates the superiority of 
China's socialist system. We must put the publicizing of the 
"Regional National Autonomy Law" at the top of the agenda and 
make it work all the time. 
  Grasp the opportunity and take pains to guide minority 
nationalities and minority-inhabited regions to correctly 
understand and handle the disparities left behind by history. 
Disparities in economic development are an objective fact, the 
result of a host of historical and geographical factors. Since 
the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the 
minority-inhabited regions have been developing rapidly 
economically, but not fast enough to prevent the gap between 
them and developed areas from widening. Should we limit 
ourselves to economic development disparities in all our talk 
about disparities, or should we look at the gaps in ideology and 
thinking as well? In my opinion, we should begin by identifying 
the ideological gaps. Once we discover where the minorities have 
fallen behind ideologically, we will have located the crux of 
the problem and the driving force of development. Successful 
ideological education is an important part of uniting everybody 
to further economic construction. Minority-inhabited regions and 
minority nationalities must be constantly guided to deepen their 
understanding of the principle put forward by the CPC: "Liberate 
thinking, seek truth from facts, unite to forge ahead, open up 
new territory, and strive for success"; to summon the courage to 
think, act, experiment, and break new ground to the extent 
objective conditions allow; and to further economic growth 
endlessly and gradually narrow the gaps, ultimately achieving 
the objective of common prosperity. 
  The CPC Central Committee and State Council have always 
taken 
the economic gaps between minority-inhabited regions and the 
rest of the nation seriously. To accelerate economic development 
in minority-inhabited regions, a string of preferential policies 
and measures have been taken, which have proved remarkably 
successful. Propaganda work has been highlighting this aspect, 
but the effort has been relatively superficial, not in-depth or 
solid enough. Therefore we need to publicize the party's various 
preferential policies and measures thoroughly and tell the 
masses about the party's moves in this area so that everybody, 
every household knows about them. That way cohesiveness is 
enhanced and people become united in striving for economic 
development and social progress. Not only is this enormously 
significant domestically, but internationally too it will speak 
volumes. 
  Routine nationality propaganda work must touch upon issues 
of 
greatest concern to the masses and succeed in dispelling doubt 
and providing correct guidance. Right now we find ourselves in 
the new situation of building a socialist market economy. In the 
wake of the development of a market economy, the masses are most 
concerned about how the various interests would be adjusted. We 
must do a good job in nationality propaganda work, targeting 
ideological understanding of relevance to the masses. 
  Since reform began and the open policy went under way, the 
national economy has been growing in a sustained and steady 
manner and living standards have widely gone up. This is mainly 
why people of all nationalities support reform and the open 
policy. The purpose of reform and the open policy is to enable a 
majority of people to secure more tangible benefits. If the 
living standard of the people in other regions of the nation 
goes up while minority regions and minority nationalities 
benefit little, still lagging in economic development, then 
reform and the open policy will have been a failure. If this 
issue is not resolved properly, there will be contradictions and 
unrest, with undesirable consequences. 
  Comrades involved in nationality work are bound by duty and 
obligation to face up to this sensitive issue, doing a good job 
in a focused way and with a confidence borne of the knowledge 
that justice is on their side and minimizing any factors that 
may potentially cause contradictions and unrest. 
  "Equality, unity, and mutual aid" is the basic principle in 
socialist nationality relations. Nationality propaganda must 
always take this theme seriously. The inter-nationality 
relationship in old China was one of political oppression and 
economic exploitation. There was simply no equality worth 
mentioning in internationality relations. Under the CPC's 
leadership, people of all nationalities have abolished the 
unequal relationship of the past and established a brand-new 
nationality relationship. To solidify this relationship, we must 
publicize national unity and national progress even more so that 
even minorities feel and experience the warmth of the extended 
family of nationalities. Although the economic and social gaps 
bequeathed to us by history still remain, they can be bridged 
through hard work. To close the gaps, we must, first of all, 
understand correctly and analyze closely their basic causes. We 
must then make the most of the resource and locational 
advantages of minority-inhabited regions. Third, we must instil 
the idea of self-reliance and the notion of hard struggle. 
Fourth, we must build up confidence. It takes meticulous, 
detailed, thoroughgoing, and painstaking propaganda and 
ideological work that is also specific, lively, and fully 
convincing to achieve all of the above. Publicize the concept of 
the "two inseparables" widely and in depth. The "two 
inseparables" is a product of history. The Chinese nation is a 
unified collection of multiple nationalities. Although there 
have been splits as well as unions over the years, unity has 
always been the dominant trend. This proves that the 56 
nationalities are interdependent and that they spur each other 
on in the interest of common development, not only politically, 
but also economically and culturally. The pattern of nationality 
distribution is characterized by intermingling among the various 
peoples. The army of cadres is also multinational. In terms of 
religion, several nationalities may subscribe to one religion, 
or one nationality may practice several religions. When it comes 
to daily habits and customs, the nationalities have common 
features as well as differences. When they diverge, they display 
their respective uniqueness. Their similarities are the result 
of the various nationalities learning from, emulating, and 
influencing one another. The above description shows that the 
"two inseparables" have deep roots. Widely and thoroughly 
publicizing the concept of the "two inseparables" and the notion 
of the various nationalities "breathing the same breath and 
sharing the same fate, their hearts beating as one" has enormous 
significance for handling internationality relations properly. 
  Publicize the customs of minorities in light of the 
developments in real life. National customs are closely 
interwoven with national characteristics and national 
psychology. Together they help a nationality survive and thrive. 
However, they can be a negative factor under particular 
circumstances, perhaps even to the extent of impeding the 
nationality's development. Here nationality propaganda workers 
have a big job on their hands, and a difficult one too. If 
mishandled, it would lead to thorny problems. Concentrate on 
guidance. Put equal emphasis on continuation, refinement, and 
innovation. Vigorously but cautiously do a good propaganda job 
to transform social customs. 
  Handle correctly the relations between the nationalities 
policy and the religious policy in terms of propaganda. 
Nationality issues are "flash points" in the world today while 
religious issues are "sticky points." "Flash points" and "sticky 
points" are often intertwined, vastly complicating nationality 
propaganda work. We must have a good understanding of the links 
and differences between the two. Strictly differentiate between 
their respective policy limits. Conduct propaganda energetically 
but cautiously. 
  In conducting nationality propaganda work, one must not only 
consider the domestic situation, but also study the political, 
economic, and cultural conditions in neighboring countries in 
earnest. On the one hand, over 30 out of the 55 minority 
nationalities in China have as their neighbors people of the 
same nationality living in another country. On the other hand, 
as part of reform and the open policy and modernization, every 
nationality needs to know the world better and let the world 
understand itself better. This presents nationality propaganda 
work with a real and serious issue. People living in border 
areas have multiple and wide-ranging ties with the neighboring 
countries. The contacts and interactions across the border have 
a broad impact. The only way to do a good job in ideological and 
political work and instill in border residents a sense of 
national pride is to study the political, economic, and cultural 
conditions in neighboring countries regularly and make 
propaganda work more proactive. 
  As for national separatists at home and abroad, we must try 
to understand their motives, familiarize ourselves with their 
methods, and expose them at an opportune moment when we know 
exactly whom to go after. Educate the masses to keep up their 
vigilance and see through the separatists' plots so that they 
will not be taken in or duped. Instead, they should take a 
clear-cut stand and fight back. 
  And then there is the tiny handful of people who try to fish 
among troubled water. They should be treated on a case-by-case 
basis. Step up the propaganda offensive to win over public 
opinion. Take advantage of contradictions to divide and 
demoralize, winning over the majority while isolating and 
cracking down on a handful of people. Properly used, negative 
teaching materials would be even more effective and successful 
in turning negative factors into positive ones and educating and 
uniting the vast majority of the people. 
  Intensify external nationality propaganda. Some Western 
nations, particularly hostile forces in the world, years ago 
adopted the "peaceful evolution" strategy toward China and are 
still practicing it. Unwilling to see China develop in leaps and 
bounds, they try in every way possible to infiltrate and carry 
out separatist and subversive activities. Taking advantage of 
the surge in nationalism around the world more recently, they 
have been working in collusion with some of the Chinese national 
separatists who have fled overseas to stir up trouble using the 
nationality and religious issues. We must maintain sharp 
vigilance against them and combat them in a reasoned manner, 
backed up by evidence, with the party's nationalities and 
religious policies. Propaganda work on this front must be done 
just right in intensity, extent, and timing. The last thing we 
should do is to give others a handle against us. 
  The primary targets of nationality propaganda work are 
cadres, intellectuals, and young people. Cadres in this context 
refer not only to cadres in minority-inhabited regions, but also 
to cadres elsewhere, particularly leading cadres at all levels. 
"Once the political line is set, cadres become the decisive 
factor." When a cadre understands the circumstances of a 
nationality and has a good grasp of the nationalities policy, he 
will be free from short-sightedness and more conscientious in 
his execution of the policy. Furthermore, he will be able to 
practice in earnest what he advocates, thereby influencing and 
leading the masses. These days old cadres are giving way to new 
ones. Some of the newly promoted cadres are not familiar with 
the nationalities policy and nationality theory. They lack a 
general knowledge of the nationalities and have little 
understanding of the principles of and tasks in nationality 
work. So the need is even more compelling for them to study 
harder. Han cadres in minority-inhabited regions must immerse 
themselves among the local masses to comprehend their conditions 
and master local customs and languages. Communicating in a 
minority language is more effective in bridging the gulf and 
promoting goodwill and friendship. Cadres in non-minority 
regions also should be well versed in the party's nationalities 
policy. 
  Avoid and eliminate the kind of damage that may be done to 
the feelings of minority nationalities by an ignorance of local 
customs. Use models to help push nationality propaganda work 
forward widely and in depth. "The power of models is boundless." 
"Light one lamp to illuminate a large area." Be adept at 
discovering models, nurturing them and publicizing them. Use 
models to further nationality work and enhance the impact of 
such work. The first national unity and progress commendation 
meeting was convened by the State Council in 1988. The second 
commendation meeting will be held this year. All provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities directly administered by 
the central government will also be holding similar gatherings. 
Treat the process of selecting advanced national unity and 
progress collectives and individuals as part of the great cause 
of furthering national unity and progress. It is a good method 
and should be regularized and institutionalized. 
  Even more important, we must discover models in a timely way 
in our daily work, review the experiences, and popularize their 
exemplary conduct promptly. The idea is to introduce a constant 
parade of models without interruption. This is an important tool 
that would help us do a good job in nationality propaganda work. 
  Mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of publishing, 
literary, and artistic units for participating in nationality 
propaganda work. "There is no minor issue in nationality and 
religion." Furthermore, a number of problems have arisen in the 
past few years concerning the way the media portrayed the 
nationality issue in their reports and the way literary and 
artistic units dealt with it in literary works, on TV, and in 
movies. Still haunted by these events, the above-mentioned units 
tend to shy away from reports and creations involving a minority 
nationality, hurting the effort to make nationality propaganda 
more widespread and multimedia. In the course of time, nobody 
will dare touch this subject and it will become a taboo, which 
would only hinder the development and progress of the entire 
Chinese nation. We must fire the courage of propaganda workers 
and literary and artistic workers to participate in nationality 
propaganda work through an active use of such media as the 
newspaper, literature, and art. At the same time, they must be 
given assistance in selecting topics carefully and handling 
sensitive matters properly. When the issue in question is 
uncertain, do not decide for yourself. Instead, explore it from 
a variety of angles and at all levels and consult with others. 
In short, the army of people in the media, in literature, and in 
art have something going for them--they have wide-ranging 
connections and wield much influence. Make the most of those 
characteristics. 
  Handle the problems that arise in nationality propaganda 
work 
carefully. Nationality propaganda work involves major policy 
issues. It embraces a broad area and touches upon many fields. 
Meanwhile, comrades engaged in nationality propaganda work are 
constrained by a variety of factors, including the limitations 
of their own professional knowledge. Hence the mistakes and 
misjudgments in nationality propaganda work and the consequent 
problems. Problems must be analyzed by looking at the specific 
facts in a particular case. When errors occur in the course of 
nationality propaganda work because of the misapplication of the 
nationalities policy, when problems arise in the publicizing of 
national customs due to ignorance, education is the answer. 
Workers who deliberately hurt national feelings and sow discord 
among the nationalities must be held accountable. Those who act 
bureaucratically and irresponsibly, thereby making errors in 
their work, must be dealt with sternly. 
  Be adept at dissolving the contradictions in 
internationality 
relations. Cadres engaged in nationality propaganda work should 
also pay attention to those contradictions. Once contradictions 
and problems occur in internationality relations, nationality 
propaganda work must serve as a catalyst, working out 
differences, providing correct guidance, breaking down barriers, 
removing contradictions, promoting understanding, and enhancing 
trust. Accordingly, we must take pains to accomplish the 
following. First, abide by the party's nationalities policy. 
Second, understand and respect the government departments' 
resolve to mediate disputes as well as their methods of dispute 
mediation. Third, analyze the specific causes of such 
contradictions. Fourth, carry out propaganda in a timely, 
precise, and thoroughly reasoned manner, resting on firm 
grounds. Distinguish between the internal and the external. 
  Nationality propaganda work must focus on mobilizing the 
initiative of the masses. When all is said and done, propaganda 
and ideological work entails mobilizing hundreds of millions of 
people to fight for the interests of the country and nation as 
well as their own interests. Nationality propaganda work is no 
exception. Accordingly, this requires us to tell the masses 
about the party's principles and policies, explaining the need 
for and feasibility of such principles and policies by relating 
them to the interests of the masses. We must explain that only 
by operating in accordance with the party's principles and 
policies will society be stable, the nation progress, the 
economy develop, and the masses be able to improve their living 
standards. Once they see the light, the masses will work hard on 
behalf of the principles and policies on their own initiative. 
  Dualism must be adhered to in nationality propaganda work as 
well. On the one hand, we strive for stability. On the other 
hand, we pursue development. Stability provides a sound 
objective environment for reform and development. It serves the 
interests of reform and development. Reform, in turn, promotes 
stability. When the economy and society thrive and when the 
masses see progress and profit tangibly, their sense of 
responsibility as master in control of their own destiny 
enhanced, stability will be the winner. The two are 
complementary and both are indispensable. 
  Nationality propaganda work must stress methods. Firmly 
adhere to guidance and enlightenment. Avoid drilling hard and 
fast rules into people's heads. Draw upon materials in real life 
and refine them into a theory. In explaining the party's 
nationalities policy, we must make the minorities feel that it 
was formulated with them in mind, that it is highly relevant to 
them and feasible and that it would benefit them if implemented 
in earnest. Once the party's policy is implemented, progress 
will be solid and development will come about rapidly. 
Otherwise, development will be delayed and living standards 
would not go up, causing unnecessary losses. Only by publicizing 
the party's policy--a profound thing--in simple terms can we 
achieve practical results. 
  Nationality propaganda work must adhere to the materialist 
dialectical method. Stick to the doctrine that everything has 
two aspects and steer clear of metaphysics; this is one method 
that works in all we do. Be careful to do a good job in 
nationality propaganda and ideological work from all angles. The 
general principle is to tell the truth, report the facts, and 
talk about the problems as well as the achievements. When we 
talk about achievements, be restrained. When we talk about 
problems, don't go overboard. In publicizing models, we should 
emphasize the facts and not exaggerate so as to project a sense 
of objectivity, truthfulness, and trustworthiness. This will 
make propaganda work more effective and influential. 
  Nationality propaganda work must stress diversity and guard 
against imposing a single policy across the board. China is a 
unified multi-national country. To publicize the party's theory, 
line, principles, and policies among 56 nationalities, 
particularly the 55 minorities, we must take into consideration 
each nationality's special characteristics, the differences in 
their respective natural, economic, cultural, and historical 
circumstances, the differences in their psychology and their 
tolerance threshold, and the differences in the frequency and 
extent of their contacts with other nationalities in China as 
well as the outside world. We must also be aware of their 
occupational differences and go about our propaganda work in a 
focused way. 
  We must put the construction of facilities for nationality 
propaganda in its proper place in the overall strategic plan. 
For historical reasons, most minority-inhabited areas are 
located in mountains, on highland, and along the border. They 
are not easily accessible by means of transportation and are cut 
off from information. Newspapers and magazines have a hard time 
getting there or do so only after a long time lag, when news is 
no longer news. Radio and television penetration rates are much 
lower in minority-inhabited areas than in the rest of the 
nation. Moreover, most minority nationalities still use their 
own languages as the tool of communication, so even if they have 
access to radio, television, newspapers, and magazines, there 
remains the insurmountable language barrier. In contrast, 
minority-language radio and television broadcasting originating 
in neighboring countries can be picked up in many 
minority-inhabited areas along the border. If this state of 
affairs continues, its negative effects can be imagined. We must 
face up to reality and make the construction of nationality 
propaganda facilities a top priority. Be willing to invest in it 
in order to put an end to the current conditions and meet the 
needs of the new situation. 
  Go out of the way to solve the practical problems in 
nationality propaganda work. Currently news and propaganda units 
in minority-inhabited areas are plagued by widespread problems 
having to do with manpower and material and financial resources. 
Backward tools and fund shortages severely constrain the 
launching and development of nationality propaganda activities. 
The news-gathering activities and literary and artistic 
propaganda organized in recent years have been a big boost to 
nationalities work. However, the remoteness and inaccessibility 
of minority-inhabited areas presents reporters and literary and 
artistic workers with numerous difficulties and prevents them 
from doing their job on a regular or permanent basis. As far as 
these problems are concerned, we have to depend on nationalities 
commissions at all levels as well as artistic and literary 
organizations to summon up their spirit of self-reliance and 
arduous struggle to overcome problems and, circumstances 
permitting, do a good job in nationalities propaganda work. 
Meanwhile, governments at all levels must understand the 
difficult position nationality news and propaganda departments 
are in and help them work out their practical problems. 
  Work hard for the leadership and support of propaganda 
departments. Nationality propaganda work is an important part of 
propaganda work. It is essential that propaganda departments at 
all levels step up their leadership and support. The 
nationalities commission should initiate regular contacts with 
the propaganda department to keep it informed of the situation. 
It should submit to the latter's leadership voluntarily and work 
hard to win its support. For their part propaganda departments 
at all levels should consider nationality propaganda work part 
of their responsibilities and take it seriously, making plans 
comprehensively and carrying them out in stages step by step. 
Implementation is one area that calls for an aggressive effort. 
  Rely on the strengths of news units. News and propaganda 
units have a nation-wide presence. The army of news workers 
constitutes a vital new force on the ideological front; they are 
politically sensitive, have a high professional caliber, and are 
familiar with the party's propaganda work. Making a success of 
nationality propaganda work is inseparable from this army. Put 
it to the fullest use. First, respect the news workers, Second, 
provide leads for their news-gathering and propaganda. Third, 
make it easier for them to gather news. Go out of the way to 
solve the problems and difficulties they encounter in 
news-gathering. 
  Utilize to the fullest the army of news and propaganda 
workers in the nationalities commission system. The 
nationalities commission system has developed a formidable 
propaganda contingent with years of experience in nationalities 
work, including some who are members of minority nationalities. 
Take advantage of their strength--their knowledge of 
minority-inhabited areas and minority nationalities--and 
mobilize their initiative and enthusiasm for serving the 
minorities and minority-inhabited areas to conduct nationality 
propaganda extensively and in depth. No doubt the news and 
propaganda (including publishing) units of our system were 
created rather late, lack the necessary wherewithal, and are not 
well connected. They also operate under more institutional 
constraints than other news and propaganda units. Moreover, most 
units are not financially self-sufficient and belong in the 
category of subsidized institutional units. For these reasons, 
therefore, we must make the deepening of internal reform a 
priority, straighten out relations, strengthen unity, improve 
the conditions in which they operate, and map out a new path of 
development. 
  Accelerate the build-up of the army of propaganda cadres in 
nationalities commission organs. That army of cadres is small in 
size but has much work to do, including a lot of coordination 
tasks. We must pay sufficient attention to this army, instead of 
considering it expendable or its size unimportant. We must rely 
on it to strengthen guidance over nationality propaganda work 
and the implementation of the plan, using it as a bridge to 
reconcile the external with the internal. In this sense, this 
army is vital, so vital that it must be strengthened, not 
weakened. It must be amplified depending on the real 
circumstances in the unit in question. Take pains to nurture 
news and propaganda cadres in order to facilitate the completion 
of nationality propaganda tasks in the new era.

<F P=106> [Article by Yan Si (0917 1835): "Querying the Theory of </F>
`Public Ownership as a Method'"] 
  [Text] A short while ago, a certain journal published a 
so-called "authoritative" article terming the public ownership 
system a method with the goal of developing productivity. Thus, 
any ownership system is fine provided it can develop 
productivity: "there is only one matter of choice in the 
ownership system" and we "should make it beneficial to 
productivity." The discussant seemingly is entirely 
unconventional, truly reaching "non-ideologization," unfettered 
by any socialist or capitalist clans. It goes without saying, 
provided the economy can develop, any system of ownership, 
public or private, is fine! 
  I would like to raise for discussion some queries regarding 
these enlightening remarks. But for a discussion to procede 
normally, first there must be the premise that everyone respects 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and all intend to undertake socialism. If there is no common 
agreement on this point, disapproval of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics with no intention of 
undertaking socialism, then there can be no discussion. Or else 
the discussion could only procede in a different sense. Now that 
Volume 3 of the Selected Writings of Deng Xiaoping 
has been published, we can analyze this issue according to it. 
  Everyone knows that Comrade Deng Xiaoping highlly regards 
developing productivity. He repeatedly has stressed "The 
fundamental principle of Marxism is to develop productivity," 
"the premier task of socialism is to develop productivity," and 
"to not develop productivity, to not improve the living 
standards of the people cannot be said to correspond to the 
needs of socialism" (Footnote 1)(Selected Writings of Deng 
Xiaoping, Volume 3, page 116). He promotes reform and an 
open door policy because the originally highly concentrated 
planned economic system had fettered the development of 
productivity, "reform is the necessary path for China to develop 
productivity." He emphasizes wholeheartedly undertaking the 
four modernizations centered around the economy, noting that we 
must button up this fundamental link without slack. If we do not 
master this point, "it is divorced from Marxism, it is only 
empty Marxism." Comrade Deng Xiaoping is entirely correct in the 
strategic ideology of concentrating energy in moving the economy 
forward. It has the wholehearted support of the people 
nationwide and is being implemented by all. 
  Nevertheless, productivity always develops within certain 
social production relationships. No economic activity can be 
divorced from society's basic system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
aforementioned developing productivity refers to doing so within 
socialist production relationships rather than being separate 
from production relationships and talking abstractly about 
developing productivity. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "We must 
realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, national 
defense, and science and technology. Yet the word `socialism' 
precedes the four modernizations; they are called the `four 
socialist modernizations.' When we talk now about enlivening 
the domestic economy and having an open door policy, they 
procede by firmly upholding the `principles of socialism,'" 
(Footnote 2)(Ibid., page 138). Clearly, from Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's concepts of developing productivity, one cannot draw 
the conclusion that productivity can be developed using any 
ownership system. Although productivity may develop a certain 
amount by taking a capitalist road, however, first, the speed of 
productivity development could not be rapid because of the 
constraints of fundamental conflicts of capitalism. Second, 
taking this path definitely leads to polarization, it "can allow 
several percent of the Chinese people to become wealthy but it 
absolutely cannot resolve the problem of the welfare of 
ninety-some percent of the Chinese people" (Footnote 3)(Ibid., 
page 64). Thus Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasizes that only 
socialism can save China. Likewise, only socialism can develop 
China, "it will not do for China to engage in capitalism." He 
clearly noted: "if our policies bring on polarization, we have 
lost. If they engender some new bourgeois class, then we really 
have taken to evil ways" (Footnote 4)(Ibid., page 111). 
  So then, what is socialism? Comrade Deng Xiaoping's response 
to this question is: "socialism has two extremely important 
aspects, one is the primacy of the public ownership system, and 
the other is non-polarization (Footnote 5)(Ibid., page 138)." In 
another place, he also clearly noted: "a public ownership system 
is the mainstay, a common wealth. This is a basic principle of 
socialism we must firmly uphold. We must resolutely implement 
and realize these socialist principles" (Footnote 6)(Ibid., page 
111). Some worry that reform is taking a capitalist road and 
China has become capitalist. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that it 
cannot be said that this worry has no reasoning. We cannot 
dispel their fears using empty talk while firmly upholding these 
two facts in reply to those who hope we become capitalist. 
Obviously, the public ownership system is not a method to 
develop the economy. The public ownership system as the mainstay 
of our economic development process from start to finish must be 
firmly upheld as a basic socialist principle. Although in the 
early stage of socialism non-socialist economic elements may 
play a positive role in developing the national economy, 
ultimately they are not mainstays but only complement the public 
ownership system. The primary position of public ownership 
cannot waver. If it does, the entire socialist endeavor will be 
shaken. Saying "the public ownership system is a method," 
obviously is contrary to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's judgement 
because methods can be used or not. The people can choose one 
method or another, but fundamental principles are not allowed to 
be cast aside or altered. 
  Why must we firmly uphold the primacy of public ownership? 
This question can only be answered with Marxism regarding the 
basic tenets of the mutual relationship between production 
relationships and productivity. Marxism contends that in social 
production, productivity is the material content of production. 
Production relationships (their base is the form of ownership) 
are the social form of production. The organic unity and 
synthesis of productivity and production relationships 
constitute a society's form of production. Within forms of 
production, the relationship between production relationships 
and productivity is not one of method and goal but rather a 
dialectical relationship: productivity determines production 
relationships and production relationships counteract 
productivity. When production relationships are suited to the 
nature of productivity, then they can promote the development of 
productivity. Conversely, they can fetter the development of 
productivity. In line with the development of capitalism, 
productivity increasingly has a social nature. Private 
capitalism vis-a-vis productivity constitutes an essential 
insurmountable problem within the capitalist system itself. It 
is precisely the nature of productivity and its development 
needs which objectively provided the necessity for public 
ownership to replace private ownership and socialism to replace 
capitalism. Our firm support of public ownership as the mainstay 
is not a subjective choice of this or that but rather it is 
because public ownership is suited to the nature of productivity 
and can promote its development. Here is the dialectical 
relationship between production relationships and productivity: 
the social nature of productivity determines the emergence of a 
socialist public ownership system, and conversely the public 
ownership system which is suited to the nature of productivity 
promotes the development of productivity. This dialectical 
relationship could not be explained within the scope of methods 
and goals. Here the reason why we take great pains to discuss 
some most rudimentary Marxist common knowledge is only because 
those who say "public ownership is a method" do not even want 
basic Marxist tenets. 
  Those who suggest "public ownership is a method, developing 
productivity is the goal" also have forgotten a basic fact, 
namely, that no society can have the goal of developing 
productivity; developing production merely as a method to attain 
a certain goal. The goals of production are not decided by the 
subjective wishes of the people but precisely by the form of 
ownership of the means of production. Whoever owns the means of 
production, social production must serve his basic interests. 
Whatever the form of ownership of the means of production, the 
owners will have special interests of that nature. 
Correspondingly, that will be the goal of social production. In 
capitalist societies, the capitalist class' private ownership 
system occupies an authoritative position and social production 
follows the basic interests of the capitalist class which 
determines that the goal of capitalist production is to seek the 
greatest surplus value or profits. Under the socialist public 
ownership system, the laboring peoples jointly hold the means of 
production, becoming the masters of social production , which 
determines that the goal of social production is to satisfy the 
material and cultural needs of all laboring peoples and to 
promote their overall self-development. Socialist countries 
develop production to satisfy the needs of the people and this 
point is determined by the socialist system of public ownership. 
These inherent ties between things are common knowledge to 
anyone with a smattering of Marxist understanding, yet 
"authoritiative" economists do not even want this most basic 
thing. 
  Considered in political terms, it is incorrect to make 
developing productivity a goal. As stated above, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping fully highly regards developing productivity but has 
never made it a fundamental aim or objective goal of socialist 
society. He has never advocated production for production's 
sake. He repeatedly has stressed "our ideals and beliefs are to 
engage in communism." Communism takes the greatest abundance of 
products as a material base. Our development of productivity is 
to manifest the superiority of the socialist system, win a 
victory over capitalism and ultimately realize communism. 
Economic work is the central task of all of our work. 
Developing the economy is to consolidate and develop the 
socialist system which is centered around public ownership, 
thereby serving the transition to communism. To abstractly and 
generally discuss developing productivity while forgetting why 
we want to do so will put one in evil ways. A saying by Richard 
Nixon, such a monopolistic capitalist class representative, is 
worth our deep consideration. In 1983 he concluded after 
visiting several eastern European countries that for eastern 
Europe, "the time is ripe for a peaceful transition" because the 
"eastern European communist party people have fully lost faith," 
"the new generation of eastern Europeans are not ideologues but 
men of action and utilitarianism may open a space for a peaceful 
transition" (Footnote 7)(Richard Nixon, 1999: Victory 
Without Battle, p 169). This passage proves the reality of 
eastern Europe's transition. This is a strike against those who 
discuss the economy all day without mentioning socialism or 
communism. They are busy all day developing the economy but 
forget that we are building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Guess what is the intention of those promoting the 
enlightening remarks that "public ownership is a method?" 
Regretfully, "authoritative" economists dare not directly 
explain. Perhaps this is a way of speaking: say half a phrase, 
hint at another. Be complicated and confusing, only suggesting, 
not stating explicitly. What the conclusion is is not clearly 
stated to allow one to guess or conjecture. According to the 
ideological logic of "authoritative" economists, public 
ownership is one method of developing productivity which can be 
chosen. Private ownership is another. Any method is fine as long 
as it can develop productivity, thus, one ought not to propose 
the matter of which ownership system is the mainstay. This is 
called "rediscovery of public ownership as the mainstay." 
Undoubtedly, "public ownership is a method" is a natural 
extension of numerous various forms of ownership systems which 
do not distinguish between primary and secondary "mixed up 
economic" thinking in the previous period. Therefore in any 
society there always is the form of ownership of the means of 
production as a mainstay. It determines the entire nature of the 
form of society and economy. There has never been a "mixed 
economy" as a mainstay. If the mainstay is not public ownership, 
then private ownership is. Which ownership system ultimately is 
the mainstay for those discussing "methods"? Unfortunately, they 
do not clearly say. However, their intentions are clear when 
related to the temporary clamor of "the results of public 
ownership are not as good as in enterprises under the three 
forms of foreign ownership or the private economy," "public 
ownership has entered a blind alley," "public ownership is not 
like market economics," "the private economy is the vanguard of 
market economics," etc. Although public ownership is only a 
method chosen to develop productivity, and public ownership is 
not as good as private ownership, then naturally we should get 
rid of public ownership and privatize. Obviously, promoting 
"public ownership is a method" is simply the theoretical basis 
for privatization. However under current historical conditions, 
privatization has to lead to capitalism. The reality of Russia 
and eastern Europe have proven this. Whatever the "methodists" 
want, why don't they say it right out?! 
  Clearly, "public ownership is a method" relates to whether 
to 
uphold public ownership as the mainstay and thus relates to 
whether to take the socialist road or a capitalist road. How can 
the people be unmoved or silent regarding such cardinal 
questions of right and wrong? Analyzing the nature of the issue 
a bit, disputing its right and wrong, undoubtedly is beneficial.

<F P=106> [Article by Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 5478) and Wan Donghua </F>
(8001 2639 5478) of the State Statistics Bureau Comprehensive 
Department: "Report on the National Situation---Concerning 
Inflation; Concerning the Scale of Investment; Concerning the 
Current Tightness of Funds---Three Problems in Current Economic 
Operations"] 
  [Text] I. Concerning Inflation 
  In 1993 market prices started high and rose greatly. For the 
year, retail prices rose 13 percent over the previous year and 
residents' cost of living prices rose 14.5 percent. For the 
year, cost of living prices in 35 large and medium-sized cities 
rose 19.5 percent. From the perspective of the yearly price 
changes, the following four new trends appear: 
  1. Urban and rural prices rose simultaneously. While in 1993 
urban prices continued their high increase, inflation of rural 
prices also clearly increased, and the increase was rather high. 
It is estimated that the annual rise will be 12.5 percent. And 
the differential with urban price rises shrank from 3.8 
percentage points to 1 percentage point. 
  2. The new price rise factor had a great affect. According 
to 
calculations, in 1993 retail market prices and residents' cost 
of living price rises, the affect of new price rise factors in 
the current year (including the adjusted price structure and 
spontaneous price rises) was 80 percent or more, clearly higher 
than the previous year. 
  3. Residents' basic cost of living prices were highly 
inflated. The 1993 urban residents' basic necessities prices, 
greatly influenced by reform of prices in such areas as grain, 
housing, and fuel, rose rather greatly. It is estimated that the 
annual rise will reach 18 percent, 2.5 percentage points higher 
than overall urban cost of living price increases. Within that, 
grain prices rose 38 percent, pork prices rose 14 percent, and 
fresh vegetable prices rose 13.5 percent. 
  4. Service prices rose sharply. For the year, it is 
estimated 
they will rise about 28 percent, effecting a 3.2 percentage 
point rise in residents' cost of living prices. Within that: 
rent rose by 23.4 percent; transportation fees rose 26.7 
percent; miscellaneous education and child care expenses rose by 
37.8 percent; entertainment expenses rose by 52.3 percent; and 
water and electrical fees, post and telegraph fees, and medical 
and health care expenses rose by 16.2 percent, 16.5 percent, and 
38.6 percent, respectively. 
  The main causes of the large prices increases are, first, 
that the country has further increased the extent of price 
reforms. On the base of successive extensive price reforms in 
the past few years, the prices of grain, steel products, and 
some unified distribution coal have been freed up; the producer 
prices of timber and unified distribution cement have been 
adjusted and raised; and the prices of some heavy oils have been 
"leveled." This has a positive function as regards smoothing 
price relations, changing the long-term low price situation of 
basic products, and forming mechanisms to gradually establish 
market prices, but it also brings with it rather large increases 
in overall price levels. The second thing is that the large 
overall scale of fixed assets and the large amount of currency 
put into circulation have increased the pressure to demand price 
rises. The third thing is that while increasing the extent of 
price reforms and accelerating economic development, there have 
not been effective checks on arbitrary price rises, covert price 
rises, and ever rising prices. The fourth thing is that the 
adjusted exchange rate fluctuated for a while. The fifth thing 
is the influence of such non-economic factors as residents' 
changing psychological expectations and the orientation of 
public opinion. 
<H5>  II. Concerning the Scale of Investment </H5>
  Our basic judgement regarding the scale of 1993 investment 
is 
that the scale of investment was already large and with an 
excessively large scale, the structure was not altogether 
reasonable. 
  From the perspective of the scale of investment already 
achieved, the 1993 rate of fixed asset investment for the whole 
society was 37.5 percent. If we discount the influence of such 
factors as the fact that the prices of investment items were 
more inflated than consumer items and actual use of foreign 
funds increased rather greatly, the approximate investment rate 
was about 33 percent, three percentage points higher than former 
years averages, making it large. Presently China is in a rather 
stable period in the growth of consumption and rapid economic 
growth relies even more on the pulling power of investment and 
the function of investment to stimulate and curb the economy is 
more pronounced than at any time in the past. To maintain the 
rapid growth of the economy, we must have the support of a 
rather high rate of investment. 
  From the perspective of establishing the overall scale, this 
obviously is too large. It is estimated that the overall scale 
established by state units for the year will reach 3.3 trillion 
yuan, 40 percent greater than the previous year. If we discount 
the fact that at the end of the year after the investment totals 
are completed, incomplete projects still require the investment 
of 1.9 trillion yuan, the increase is close to 60 percent and 
the ratio that it occupies reaches as high as 57.6 percent, far 
exceeding normal limits. The root cause of the establishment of 
an excessively large overall scale is that reform of the 
investment system is lagging, and it lacks effective investment 
risks and responsible restraint mechanisms. A considerable 
number of regions do not arrange their investment based on the 
capability of their regions to utilize such aspects as their 
area's resources, technological advantages, market prospects, 
and funds, but blindly keep raising them, craving to rashly put 
up establishments, increase projects, and expand the economic 
scale, forming low-level duplication and unchecked development. 
Based on the situation in 1993, not only does this make the 
entire atmosphere of economic operations tight, but in the area 
of investment itself, it brings about the following two 
problems: First it lowers investment returns, reflected in the 
fact that all indicators for overall investment returns declined 
from the same period the previous year. Secondly, it exacerbated 
the tight funds. 
  As regards the structure of investment, there are some not 
altogether reasonable places: One is that the share of 
investment in energy and raw material industries has declined. 
The share of investment completed in the first eleven months 
declined from 42.9 percent in the same period the previous year 
to 36.9 percent. The second is a clear tendency toward extension 
of investment. In the first eleven months, investment used in 
newly extended projects increased by 78.3 percent and the share 
rose from 34.1 percent in the same period of the previous year 
to 38.6 percent. Among transformation and renovation funds, the 
share used for newly expanded investment rose from 48.8 percent 
to 53.8 percent, but the share used for reconstruction and 
replacement of equipment declined from 43 percent to 40.3 
percent. The third thing is that wasteful government buildings, 
first class villas, vacation villages, and recreational places 
have increased too much. 
<H5>  III. Concerning the Contradiction of the Current Tightness </H5>
of Funds 
  In the past few months, the state has several times in 
succession injected large amounts of currency, used mainly to 
support the normal production and operation of key industries 
and key enterprises, key development of the railroad, coal, and 
petroleum industries, the purchase of such agricultural products 
and byproducts as grain and cotton, and good performing foreign 
trade purchase and export production enterprises. This is 
helpful in alleviating the contradiction of the tightness of 
funds widespread in the previous period. But the fact that 
several areas presently reflect a shortage of funds still is a 
pronounced problem and the cry for an increased supply of funds 
is extremely strong. 
  Why is it that with the state putting so much money in 
circulation several sectors still generally feel that the "blood 
supply" is inadequate? On the surface, there is a problem in the 
total supply of funds and a more intense influence from market 
restraints: 
  1. Channels for social funds are changing and the overall 
supply of funds is shrinking. In the first half of the year 
before the central government implemented strengthened 
macroeconomic control measures, there were six channels for 
regions' funds: Bank loans, short-term interbank loans, raising 
funds, non-bank credit, bonds, and foreign funds. But since the 
second half of the year, this situation has changed greatly. 
Short-term interbank loans and raising of funds have been 
stifled, they have stopped issuing bonds, and non-bank credit is 
strictly controlled. In addition, the repayment of short-term 
interbank loans has caused the overall supply of funds to 
society to clearly shrink. It is estimated that for the year, 
social credit funds for other than state banks will be reduced 
by upwards of 100 billion yuan from the previous year. 
  2. Market circulation is not smooth and fund sedimentation 
is 
increasing with a corresponding decrease in the currency in 
circulation, aggravating the the tight situation in the supply 
and demand of funds. Beginning in August, along with the 
changing market supply and demand circumstances, the industrial 
production and sales ratio has declined somewhat and 
overstocking has clearly risen. In addition, arrearages among 
enterprises are becoming increasingly acute, further aggravating 
the tightness of enterprise funds. 
  3. Some newly added loans are being used for such 
expenditures as supplementing tax revenues and paying off water 
and electric fees. From analyzing the deep-seated causes, the 
present tight money is an inevitable reflection in the current 
period of enterprises' for a long time in the past disregarding 
the capabilities of their funds and resources, wantonly 
competing to invest and in many ways pushing in and seizing 
their own circulating funds, along with slow adjustments in the 
structure of savings and low efficiency in the use of funds. 
Strengthening macroeconomic controls only serves to set it off 
and causes the contradiction to appear by being concentrated. 
  As regards enterprise automatic circulating funds, because 
enterprise operating mechanisms still have not been converted, 
self-development capabilities and self-restraint awareness are 
not strong, and automatic circulating funds are constantly being 
seized and diverted, leading to a decline in the share of 
automatic circulating funds from year to year and a great 
weakening of the ability to withstand market risks. Once the 
money supply is tightened, tightening of enterprise funds is 
unavoidable. 
  In the 1983 national budget, state industrial enterprise 
automatically circulating funds made up 55 percent of the 
circulating funds quota. By the end of 1992, it had declined to 
21.4 percent, and nearly 80 percent of funds relied mainly on 
bank loans. The factors influencing the constant decline in the 
share of enterprise automatically circulating funds are: First, 
multiple extrusions and nibbling have caused automatically 
circulating funds to run off. Quite a few newly established or 
expanded enterprises have not proportionately arranged for 
corresponding underlying circulating funds for their investments 
or they have not arranged for enough. Some even rely on 
diverting circulating funds and construction enterprise advances 
to wantonly compete for projects. Some automatically circulating 
enterprise funds also are used to dilute losses found in 
successive years' appraisals of fixed assets and circulating 
funds. The second thing is that they have not been promptly 
replenished. Some enterprises even divert funds for use in 
speculating on real estates and stocks. In addition, high rising 
inflation also eats away some funds. 
  As regards the adjustment of the structure of enterprise 
reserves, because they have been influenced by numerous factors 
such as unclear property rights relations, unsound social 
guarantee systems, and the vertical and horizontal separation of 
localities and departments, it is difficult for enterprises to 
get state guarantees for selecting the superior and weeding out 
the inferior and good or bad operations and gradually enduring 
the difficulty of adjusting reserves. Enterprises that have 
fallen into losses and whose funds are the tightest yell the 
strongest. In addition, the low efficiency of the use of funds 
to a certain extent aggravates the current tightness of funds. 
  The problems described above should be resolved by 
intensified reform, a sound legal system, and stronger controls.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zhuoyuan (1728 0587 0337): "Status of </F>
Closely Monitoring Inflation and Prices Rises in 1994"] 
  [Text] What is the status of prices in 1994? This is a 
question which has people very concerned. 
  With the rapid economic growth of 1992 and 1993, the level 
of 
prices has steadily risen as well. In 1993, the retail sales 
price index rose about 13 percent, wile the cost of living index 
for urban and rural residents rose about 14.5 percent (of which 
12 percent were new price inflation factors). The economy is 
maintaining its rapid growth trend in 1994, and with the average 
economic growth estimated to be slightly over 10 percent, it 
will be difficult to hold down inflation. I believe that not 
only will it be hard to accomplish the goal of keeping inflation 
within the 10 percent that was set at last year's National 
Economic Work Conference, we should consider ourselves well off 
if we can keep the 1994 inflation rate to not much more than the 
13 percent of 1993. The price situation in 1994 will be quite 
serious, and urgently needs close monitoring. 
  There are at least several factors supporting the above 
estimate. 
  First, with so strong a trend to fixed asset investment, 
there is not too much release of inflationary pressures. Because 
there was very widespread 1993's fixed asset investment, with a 
large increase in projects being built on too wide a scale, the 
amount of investment required is very large. In addition, each 
region and department is grasping all opportunities to seed 
rapid development. They are full of drive to set projects and 
expanding their construction scale, and this means that fixed 
asset investment in 1994 will continue to be hot, and this will 
be hard to control efficiently. This inevitably will sharpen an 
already tight supply of capital, further expand the scale of 
borrowing, put in more currency, and accelerate the pace at 
which currency supply continuously exceeds the economic growth 
rate. This is a situation usually unfavorable to easing 
inflationary pressures. The lack of tight controls could also 
possibly increase them. The inflationary pressures of the last 
year have not been fully released, or are still in the process 
of release, with the rate of inflation remaining high and not 
going down. Therefore, the constant expansion trend of 
investment in 1994 will make it very hard to control the 
inflation rate efficiently. 
  Second, the rise in the cost of goods caused by merging the 
exchange rate for Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC) with that 
of the Renminbi (RMB) will be a powerful impetus to inflation. 
The merger of the FEC with the RMB at the beginning of 1994 
caused a tremendous drop in the rate of exchange between the RMB 
and the FEC which was originally set by the government. It 
dropped from $1=5.8 yuan RMB to $1=8.7 yuan RMB, and inevitably 
will cause at least some imported raw materials and consumer 
products to rise in price, rapidly increase the power of costs 
to push price increases. The adjustment in State officials' 
wages began in October, 1993 and the adjustment of enterprise 
and institutional wages it brought with it will also increase 
the cost of goods, which will push prices up further. In 
addition, adjustments in employees' wages will naturally 
increase consumers' demand for them. This is another 
inflationary factor which cannot be ignored. 
  Third, reform of the tax system reform will also affect 
inflation. The tax system reform this time especially implements 
a comprehensive value added tax. An important measure for 
pushing China's tax system toward regularization, it fits the 
requirements of developing the socialist market economy. We can 
believe that implementing a value added tax won't add to 
enterprises' general burden. But to conclude from this that it 
won't push prices up is not very convincing. This is because 
after the value added tax is implemented, although in general it 
will not add to the burden on enterprises, different enterprises 
have differing situations. Most enterprises will not have an 
added tax burden, and some may even lose some, but a few 
enterprises (about 28 percent of the state-owned enterprises) 
really will have an added tax burden. The former category of 
enterprises will not in general try to shift the burden, so 
there will not be the phenomenon of prices declining due to 
their losing some tax burden; the latter category of enterprises 
will try everything they can to shift the added tax burden, and 
it is easier to do this in a situation where there is a strong 
consumption demand. International experience has proven that it 
is best to choose a relatively stable economic environment for 
comprehensively implementing a value added tax, for in this 
situation it will be favorable to attack the causes of inflation. 
  Fourth, the new adjustment and releasing of prices will push 
them up further. In 1994, the state will raise its grain and 
cotton purchase prices, and the rising of these two basic 
agricultural products will inevitably push the whole price level 
upward. In 1994, the controlled price will be released on 200 
million tons of coal allocations, and the price will go up on 
planned medium price crude oil (about 40 million tons of planned 
price oil will rise from over 200 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, and 
in addition, 60 million tons of planned high price oil will rise 
from 550 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, a price still lower than the 
international market price). The price of electricity will also 
go up, grain purchasing and sales price will also open up, etc. 
These moves will no doubt push price levels up continuously. In 
addition, in the second half of 1993 the level of general retail 
sale prices rose obviously higher than in the first half year 
(up to about 15 percent). Overconfidence is the only factor 
which can affect 1994 prices rising two to three percentage 
points, especially as the price index for the cost of living in 
35 large and medium size cities rose 2.8 percent in November, 
1993 over October, and then rose 3.2 percent in December from 
November. Therefore, overconfidence is the only factor which can 
affect 1994's prices rising about 5 percent. 
  Fifth, there are forecasts of inflation and a growing 
inflationary psychology. Due to the lasting overheated economy 
and a premature increase in the supply of currency, the pressure 
caused by inflation will gradually increase, causing these 
forecasts and the psychology of inflation. This is a factor 
worth noting. Since these inflation forecasts have been 
occurring, the slightest sign can send residents into panic 
purchasing. It is easy for some people to take this opportunity 
to raise prices, thereby disturbing market and reaping 
staggering profits. Many places rushed to purchase grain in 
November and December, 1993, and in some places the rush to 
purchase imported home electrical appliances and gold jewelry, 
etc. at the end of 1993 was explained by this. Residents' 
predictions of inflation and the inflationary psychology will 
form a fake consumer demand, causing some places sometimes to 
twist the relationship between supply and demand. For inflation, 
this is like pouring oil on the fire, so it deserve our 
attention. 
  The year 1994 will be one of great strides forward in the 
reform of China's economic system. The birth of five big reforms 
involving revenue, finance, investment, foreign trade and 
foreign currency and administration of state-owned assets will 
cause greater adjustments in the original profit pattern, which 
can easily cause social shock. In order to let reform go 
smoothly, reducing the risks, we must create a very stable 
economic environment for the birth of these five reforms. On 
this aspect, I think, the state's macroeconomic policy is 
particularly important. If the state adopts a relatively safe 
macroeconomic policy, it will strengthen and improve 
macroeconomic adjustment and control, appropriately suppress the 
tendency of each place to battle for investments and projects, 
restrain inflationary trends, and control too-rapid rises in the 
general price level. It can create a better and relatively light 
environment for reform, as well as keep the economy stable when 
there is faster reform. 
  What is worth worrying about is that the state's 
macroeconomic policy often suffers pressures from some 
departments, localities and enterprises, which demand release of 
credit, loans and money. This not only guarantees increases but 
also relaxes alertness to inflation and higher prices, as well 
as taking various ways to oppose or resist the state's 
macroadjustment and control of cutbacks in activities. This 
situation now exists. Quite a few localities and enterprises, in 
order to pursue faster profits, ease financial difficulties or 
employment pressures, attain greater achievements in 
administration or career, are seeking more investment, higher 
speed, and not admitting that their own departments, localities 
and work units are operating at an excessively hot speed. This 
makes it more difficult for the state to implement a safe and 
healthy macroeconomic policy, and easily gives the impression 
that the situation is out of control. Once control of investment 
is lost, the economy will again get hot or even get hotter than 
before, sharpening inflation, maintain more that 15 percent in 
continuous inflation, and break through the median inflation 
line, which will critically destroy economic stability. At that 
time, it will be hard to achieve a soft economic landing by 
means of small adjustments; rather, we will need to carry out a 
hard landing by means of big adjustments, and losses will be 
bigger. The development of inflation and price increases will to 
a great degree critically affect how smoothly economic reform 
goes, and make it increasingly risky, as well as being 
unfavorable to the healthy operation of the socialist market 
economy. Excessive rises in prices will first of all be 
unfavorable to further price reforms: many measures to adjust 
prices and ease them, things which should be done now, will have 
to be postponed or canceled. This was the situation in both 1986 
and 1988; it could also bring back unreasonable price 
relationships. Second, it inevitably will propel the development 
of opportunistic activities, disrupting the market and damaging 
our building and fostering of a market system. Third, it will 
inevitably widen the income gap, with a few people suddenly 
getting rich by seizing every opportunity to do so, hoarding, 
cornering markets, and driving up prices, while others who are 
on salary or retirees' fixed income will probably find their 
living standard falling, producing a mood of discontent. 
Finally, it will also be hard to bring about government 
macroadjustment and control, industrial policy will be difficult 
to implement, and this will affect enterprises' normal 
production and operations. 
  Generally, in order to permit the several major topics of 
reform function smoothly, in order to have health development of 
the domestic economy, we must pay close attention to the trend 
of inflation and rising prices, implement appropriate 
macroeconomic policy, and restrain inflation. These actions will 
control rising prices over a wide scale, and keep the economy 
stable.

the Top---How Can the Government Manage Prices?"] 
  [Text]In engaging in the socialist market economy, it 
is inevitable that the prices that were too rigidly controlled 
under the former planned economic system be gradually freed up. 
There is not the slightest doubt about this. But in freeing up 
prices, will everything be fine and everywhere be peaceful? Do 
governments in market economy countries no longer manage prices? 
Obviously this is not the case. Since China's government still 
must manage prices, how does it management them? To manage them 
too much and too rigidly and return to the old system obviously 
will not do. If they are managed too little and too laxly, large 
price fluctuations will inevitably occur. This also is 
unacceptable. How does the government manage prices under 
socialist market economy conditions? This truly is a new 
problem. This article by Comrade Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary 
of the State Planning Commission and deputy bureau head of the 
former State Pricing Bureau, deserves to be read. 
  With the historically great progress in China's price 
reform, 
the traditional price managing system characterized by a high 
degree of centralization and administrative methods alone, has 
been essentially eliminated, and a new price managing system 
framework is gradually being formed. Under these circumstances, 
questions clearly confront us such as: Is price reform complete 
or not; After prices are freed up will they be allowed to 
drift;? and how are prices managed in a market economy? Whether 
we can properly answer these questions in theory and promptly 
resolve these questions in practice is directly related to 
continuing price reform and to a certain extent affects the 
sound development of the economy and the stability of society. 
  Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equate To Completing 
Reform 
  In fifteen years of price reform, China has converted from 
planned pricing mechanisms to socialist market pricing 
mechanisms and has already made some decisive steps. The highly 
centralized government fixed price system has been smashed and 
the prices of the vast majority of commodities are formed by the 
market. Since the end of 1992, the retail prices of only 5.9 
percent of the commodities in society were set by the 
government; the prices of 12.5 percent of the total agricultural 
products sold by farmers were set by the government; and the 
prices of 18.7 percent of capital goods sold by industrial 
enterprises were set by the government. The comparative price 
relations of major commodities have been fundamentally improved 
and the price structure is constantly being rationalized. The 
scissors of industrial and agricultural product prices is 
greatly reduced. In 1992 the industrial products that farmers 
could exchange the same amount of agricultural products for had 
increased by 50.9 percent from 1978. The low price situation of 
extraction and basic industries had clearly improved. The 
domestic selling price of more than 95 percent of imported 
commodities were directly related to international market prices 
through the agency system. These all are historically great 
achievements, creating important prerequisites for the formation 
of socialist market pricing mechanisms. 
  But price reform is by no means complete. According to the 
goals for the reform of the economic system determined by the 
party's Fourteenth Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
Fourteenth Central Committee, the fundamental task of price 
reform is to establish socialist market pricing mechanisms. 
These pricing mechanisms are mainly formed by the market with 
macroeconomic control by the government. The basic requirement 
is that in the formation of prices the vast majority of 
commodities enter the market. Because enterprises rely on market 
supply and demand to determine prices, in pricing they can 
adjust prices through supply and demand in an ordered market 
atmosphere of unified open competition and prices lead to 
rational distribution of resources. On top of price restraints, 
the government can establish a complete and effective system to 
control prices and using limited fixed prices as the mainstay 
adopt price fixing activity that conforms to the standards of 
the market economy and legal standards. Comparing the successes 
already achieved with these reform goals, we should say that 
there still is a considerable gap: 1) The market system still is 
not sufficiently developed. The current market structure is 
comparatively unitary. Development of the market for the 
elements of production has just begun. The scale of the market 
is still comparatively small, facilities are imperfect, trading 
methods are backward, and market regulations are very unsound, 
and regional blockades and division of markets still exist. With 
prices formed in this kind of market, we cannot flexibly reflect 
the overall supply and demand of society and the degree of 
scarcity of resources and we cannot accurately transmit signals 
for the orientation of resources. The December 1993 grain price 
fluctuations occurred after China's grain production had had 
successive years of bumper harvests and state reserves were 
ample, and overall supply and demand were balanced. To a very 
great extent this situation is directly related to the fact that 
China's current market system is not sufficiently developed. 2) 
Reform of internal enterprise operational mechanisms still is 
incomplete. Although enterprises that have fixed prices as their 
mainstay already have competition induced mechanisms, generally 
speaking they still lack the restraining mechanisms of risks, 
lack a complete internal price control system, and lack the 
understanding, the experience, and the ability to make 
scientific pricing decisions. The first half of last year, 
certain large steel enterprises took advantage of the inflated 
scale of investment and the great demand for building materials 
and contended with one another to inflate prices and even 
colluded to raise prices, causing steel prices to double. 
Subsequently prices fell sharply and steel piled up in the 
warehouses creating circulating difficulties for enterprise 
production. This is just a typical example of the situation. 3) 
A price control system still has not been established. After the 
scope of prices under direct state control was greatly reduced, 
an effective price control system and a complete set of prices 
laws and regulations still were not established for the vast 
majority of freed up commodity and service prices. Although the 
state began to establish reserves for some commodities and 
certain regions established price adjustment funds for a few 
important varieties, generally speaking economic methods still 
are very weak, legislation is relatively retarded, and controls 
are lacking in strength, not very suited to the development of 
the overall reform situation, and becoming a pronounced 
contradiction in current reform. 4) The problem of the 
unsuitable pricing system still has not been completely 
resolved. The prices of a few basic products such as energy and 
railroad transportation and infrastructure prices still are low, 
which is disadvantageous to preferential distribution of 
resources, and grain purchasing prices are not altogether 
reasonable. The relative performance of grain production has 
declined and the scissors differential of industrial and 
agricultural products that had been reduced since reform, in 
recent years has given indications of expanding, which is 
disadvantageous to the stable growth of agricultural production. 
All of these situations indicate that it still is necessary to 
put forth a great deal of actual arduous effort to accomplish 
price reform. We especially must continue to develop the market 
system and establish a unified, free, competitive, and orderly 
market system; and promote reform of internal enterprise 
operating mechanisms. We should actively cultivate the market as 
the mainstay; pay close attention to establishing a sound price 
control system, and continue to smooth the price relations of 
important commodities. Only if we do this can we establish 
socialist market pricing mechanisms. 
  We Cannot Take a Hands Off Approach to Prices Under 
Market Economy Conditions 
  An important characteristic of the market economy is using 
economic benefits as a fundamental driving force and realizing 
optimum distribution of resources through the market. This type 
of economy has mechanisms to encourage competition and is 
vigorous. It also is a legal system economy, limiting the 
negative effects that spontaneity and blindness can produce on 
the market. Socialist market pricing mechanisms also must fully 
realize this important characteristic. 
  With the vast majority of commodity and service prices freed 
up, since producers and businesses have obtained autonomy in 
fixing prices, it has greatly aroused enthusiasm for production 
and business and clearly promoted economic development, a 
flourishing market, and improvements in people's lives. But at 
the same time, in some regions, departments, and institutions, 
certain chaotic phenomena have occurred such as: Exceeding 
authority in establishing prices, arbitrarily collecting fees, 
monopoly prices, seeking exorbitant profits, getting on the 
bandwagon to raise prices, raising prices without authorization, 
clambering to raise prices, demanding exorbitant prices, 
cheating and gouging, and counterfeit and inferior goods. 
Although the manifestations of these problems are somewhat 
different in different regions and different sectors, their 
danger cannot be overlooked. They disrupt the economic order and 
affect the image of reform, damage the interests of the masses, 
and to a certain extent promote overall inflation. According to 
calculations, in the 13 percent total rise in the retail prices 
of society in 1993, spontaneous price increases made up 6.8 
percentage points. A significant portion of this was caused by 
chaotic prices. These chaotic prices essentially are produced by 
the disorderly activity of various special interests who, with 
the pattern of interests drastically changing, pursue their own 
benefits and do not care about the benefits of society. It is a 
reflection of the spontaneity and blindness of the market 
economy. To guard against and overcome the destructive effects 
that this spontaneity and blindness can produce, the state must 
control and manage economic activity and market prices. 
  Western market economy countries also do not take a hands 
off 
approach to prices. All major developed countries have 
established different levels and different types of price 
control structures, distinguishing the different situations for 
commodities and services and have adopted separate direct 
control, indirect control, and oversight and inspection 
measures. Japan has established a unified national price control 
structure with a price issue council structure to make price 
decisions and a price administering structure with the Price 
Bureau of the Economic Planning Agency at its core. France has a 
National Competition Commission as the general bureau to check 
on competition, consumption, and anti-fraud. Thailand has the 
Fair Price and Monopoly Prevention Commission established by the 
Ministry of Commerce for unified control of national prices. The 
United States has not established a national unified price 
control structure, but oversight and control of overall price 
levels is maintained by the Labor Department of the federal 
government; railroad freight prices are controlled by the 
government's Interstate Commerce Commission; and consumer 
interests and enterprise price oversight is undertaken by the 
Consumer Bureau. In Germany national control of commodity prices 
generally is the responsibility of state government economic 
agencies. 
  The items with direct government control of prices by 
various 
countries are: Japan has such products as petroleum, coal, 
railroads, air transport, public housing, land prices, rice, 
cigarettes, and salt, approximately 18 percent of the products 
in consumer price indices statistics. The United States has 
public utilities such as, electric power, taxis, subways, cable 
television, running water, gas, public housing rent, and museum 
tickets, making up between 5 percent and 10 percent of citizens' 
consumable expenditures. In France there are such things as 
public transportation, post and telegraph, health care, spirits, 
education, military industrial products, and agricultural 
products, making up approximately 20 percent of commodities and 
fees. In Germany there are such things as railroads, 
pharmaceuticals, coal, agricultural products, lawyer, architect, 
and notary fees, and legally stipulated insurance fees, making 
up 22-26 percent of commodities and public utility fees. 
Countries' governments have three forms of indirect price 
controls. One is the use of monetary policy and financial policy 
by adjusting the reserve discount rate, the interest rate, and 
the use policy budget, adjusting government expenditures to 
regulate overall supply and demand of society. The second is to 
use industrial policy to support the development of key 
industries. For example, the United States conducts a price 
support and subsidy policy for agricultural products to protect 
farmers' interests and the European Union and Japan also have a 
considerable number of agricultural product subsidies. The third 
is social intervention measures, intervening by means of price 
oversight from a consumer commission or the public opinion of 
society. Foreign price oversight and inspection also are very 
serious. They have established special price oversight and 
inspection forces, and some countries arm their inspectors and 
when necessary they can search and serious law-breakers are 
prosecuted. Throughout today's world there is not a country, 
whether a developed country or a developing country, that 
completely lets prices drift. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the party's Fourteenth Central 
Committee, based on China's practical experience since reform 
and opening up and consulting certain general practices of 
Western countries, made some clear determinations regarding 
establishing a macroeconomic control system. The plenary session 
passed the Decision on Some Issues Regarding the Establishment 
of a Socialist Market Economy System pointing out that 
"establishing an improved macroeconomic control system with 
indirect controls as the principle means will ensure the healthy 
operation of the national economy" and "further conversion of 
the operating mechanisms of state enterprises" and "establishing 
a national unified free market system... is the basic framework 
for a mutually related and mutually restraining, organic, 
complete, and integral socialist market economy system. We must 
establish corresponding legal systems and adopt feasible 
measures centered on these important links to actively and 
gradually totally advance reform and promote the development of 
productive forces in society." 
  Establishing an Improved Price Control System is an 
Urgent Task of Current Price Reform 
  In the new situation with the marketization of the Chinese 
economy constantly increasing, in order to continue to promote 
reform of the economic system, enhance and improve macroeconomic 
controls, guard against dramatic price fluctuations, curb 
excessive inflation, standardize market pricing , and achieve 
equal competition, fair trade, and appropriate operations, we 
must establish a complete and effective government control 
system for prices. This new price control system should reflect 
the demands of the market economy and controls should be focused 
on maintaining an overall balance in the economy mainly by 
macroeconomic controls and the object of controls should be the 
entities and markets that determine prices mainly by indirect 
controls. Control methods should use mainly economic means and 
legal means augmented as necessary by administrative means. 
Establishment of this kind of price control system should be a 
gradual process of constantly enriching and improving the means 
of control with the intensification of reform, strengthening 
economic forces, and perfecting the legal system. It will 
require a considerable period to be completed. We should base 
ourselves on the current situation and take into consideration 
the long-term, center on stable market prices and standard 
pricing activities, and pay close attention to establishing 
sound economic means and legal means to control prices. 1) 
Establish a reserve system for important commodities such as 
grain, cotton, and petroleum to prepare to engage in the market 
to guarantee the needs of society when production and supply and 
demand fluctuate. 2) Establish an adjustment fund for the prices 
of grains and non-staple foods to be used to level prices when 
large rises or large falls occur in the prices, and protect 
production and protect consumption, and stabilize the economy, 
and legalize the channels of sources and the orientation of uses 
of the fund through legislative processes. 3) Sound pricing laws 
and regulations to encourage competition and oppose monopolies; 
protect legitimate profits and oppose windfall profits; protect 
appropriate businesses and oppose cheating and gouging and 
attack fake and inferior goods. Beginning in March of this year, 
with the agreement of the State Council, the State Planning 
Commission promulgated and implemented the Regulations for 
Implementing Clearly Marked Prices for Goods and Services as an 
important economic regulation to encourage fair market trading, 
improve the transparency of pricing, and oppose deceptive 
pricing. 4. Initiate price information services. Price 
departments at every level should fully utilize current 
information networks and in accordance with the needs of society 
extensively collect, collate, and issue price information, and 
in a timely fashion provide enterprises with the situation and 
forecast trends on market supply and demand and prices for 
various important commodities and in various different forms 
such as engaging price advisors, special consultation, and 
issuing publications, initiate price information services 
leading enterprises to organize production and adjust business 
orientation in accordance with market demands. 5) Enhance 
enterprise policy direction and business training to help 
enterprise administrative personnel master market business and 
sales tactics and price decision skills, and improve their 
professional qualities. 6) Conduct appropriate administrative 
intervention for a few important commodities. For essential 
capital goods and citizens' basic necessities that can easily 
have price fluctuations, we should conduct necessary and 
appropriate intervention distinguishing different situations. We 
can respectively carry out price rise files, price rise 
declarations, differential profit rate controls, and temporary 
price limit measures. The recent State Council decision to 
monitor the prices of twenty commodities and services that are 
most closely associated with the lives of the masses is a new 
move to stabilize people's lives and promote reform of the price 
control system from key variety breakthroughs. It reflected the 
principle of making indirect controls the mainstay and combining 
economic means and appropriate administrative intervention to 
control the frequency and extent of price rises and falls and 
curb windfall profit activities, and it helps to keep overall 
prices levels relatively stable. We should combine actual 
conscientious implementation of various price monitoring 
measures to better serve the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability.

<F P=106> [Commentator article: "Firmly Grasp New Economic Growth </F>
Points"] 
  [Text] While we are proceeding from the actual situation in 
Hunan to implement the "Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, a task deserving our 
serious attention is to firmly grasp the new economic growth 
points, that is, to make all-out efforts to develop township 
enterprises, the individually and privately owned economic 
sectors, the "three kinds of foreign-funded" enterprises 
[Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative 
enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises], the tertiary 
industry, and the new-and high-tech industry. This is of 
strategic importance to our economic development and to the 
formation of a socialist market economic system in Hunan. 
  Though Hunan is a big agricultural province, we have a 
relatively poor self-improvement capacity for agriculture. Our 
industry has a certain foundation, yet the efficiency is not 
high. And since we are located in the interior, it is somewhat 
difficult to introduce foreign capital into our province for 
economic development. Because of this, we should make full use 
of our own conditions and take the cultivation of new economic 
growth points as an area to make breakthroughs and as a 
strategic task in expediting our economic development. In recent 
years, we are happy to note that new economic growth points in 
our province have developed from small and weak operations to 
big and strong undertakings and become a not-to-be-slighted 
force in our economy. Especially last year, we made some 
breakthroughs in developing township enterprises and the 
individually and privately owned economic sectors, and scored a 
rapid growth in the tertiary industry, the "three kinds of 
foreign-funded" enterprises, and the new- and high-tech 
industry. However, there is still a rather big gap between our 
economy and that of coastal areas. To close this gap, we must 
put in more efforts to develop our new economic growth points. 
  Firmly grasping the new economic growth points involves the 
question of further emancipating people's minds, renewing their 
values, and heightening their understanding. Now, few people are 
harping on the issue of "capitalism" versus "socialism." But, in 
dealing with questions, quite a number of comrades still have 
not truly changed their viewpoint from "whether it is pure" to 
"whether it is beneficial." They fear that giving a free rein to 
developing non-state-owned economic sectors, such as township 
enterprises, the individual and private economic undertakings, 
and the "three kinds of foreign-funded" enterprises, will impair 
socialist public ownership. Actually, this fear is unnecessary. 
The "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee points out: We should adhere to the principle 
of taking public ownership as the mainstay and effecting a 
simultaneous development of all economic sectors. While striving 
actively to promote the development of the state and collective 
economy, it is necessary to encourage the development of the 
individually owned, privately owned and foreign-invested 
economic sectors. This is a correct policy decision based on the 
actual condition of development of China's social productive 
forces at the present stage. The mainstay status of socialist 
public ownership is manifested principally by its leading role 
in the national economy and its control over the national 
economic lifeline rather than by the overwhelmingly large number 
of state-owned enterprises. Taking public ownership as the 
mainstay is a nationwide principle. As far as each locality is 
concerned, there is no need to dispute about the status of 
public ownership, and still less should simple percentage 
figures be used to restrict the cultivation and development of 
the new economic growth points. All levels of leadership should 
overcome the idea that developing the individually and privately 
owned economic sectors runs counter to adhering to the principle 
of taking public ownership as the mainstay. Instead, they should 
firmly grasp the new economic growth points in a more daring 
spirit and with a new mindset and see to it that these new 
economic activities are spreading from a few places to many 
regions and then to the whole province like a prairie fire. 
  To firmly grasp the new economic growth points, we must 
persist in basing our actions on the actual conditions of 
various localities. This means that it is necessary to work out 
measures in line with specific local conditions so as to exploit 
strong points, sidestep shortcomings, bring advantages into full 
play, and make breakthroughs in key areas. In our province, the 
concrete situation is that different localities have different 
backgrounds and resources, and their manpower and financial 
capacities vary immensely. Some localities may find it feasible 
to develop the individually and privately owned economic sectors 
as the main undertakings. Other localities may have favorable 
conditions for developing the "three kinds of foreign-funded" 
enterprises or the tertiary industry. Still other localities may 
focus on developing new-and high-tech industry as their primary 
goal. This makes it necessary to conduct thoroughgoing 
investigations, step up the study of local conditions, and work 
out decisions in a scientific way. Generally speaking, we should 
focus on developing those growth points which have a sound 
foundation and great potential for development, which can make 
fast headway, and which are capable of yielding good economic 
returns. We should make breakthroughs in and pay particular 
attention to developing such growth points so as to turn them 
into our main enterprises and pillar industries. In particular, 
those areas that are relatively backward or late in cultivating 
the new economic growth points should do their utmost to tap 
local potentials and make use of their exploitable conditions. 
They should persistently apply the method of advancing from a 
few small projects using indigenous techniques to many big 
projects using advanced foreign technology. They should give 
priority to efficiency, launch more "short, level, and quick" 
projects [projects that can become operational in a short time, 
are suitable for small- and medium-scale operations, and can 
produce quick economic returns], and accumulate funds step by 
step for continued development. Of course, basing action on 
local conditions does not mean being limited by local conditions 
or rigidly adhering to a locality. What is also necessary is to 
be adept at drawing on successful experience from outside. 
Especially at present when funds, technology, and competent 
manpower are flowing and spreading continuously from 
economically developed coastal areas to the vast expanse in the 
interior, it is necessary to firmly seize this opportunity. We 
should, through various channels and measures, make full use of 
the outside funds, technology, equipment, and manpower in 
developing the new economic growth points in our province. 
  To firmly grasp the new economic growth points, we should 
have more flexible policies to strengthen the guidance for and 
ensure the implementation of the various tasks. Now, all 
departments, from the central to the provincial and municipal 
levels, have formulated policies to encourage, support, and 
develop township enterprises, individually and privately owned 
economic sectors, the tertiary industry, the "three kinds of 
foreign-funded" enterprises, and the new- and high-tech 
industry. These policies should be put into practice as soon as 
possible. Meanwhile, great efforts should be made to solve the 
problems of lack of a relaxed environment, no coordination 
between departments, and incoherent actions between the higher 
and lower levels. We should see to it that cadres and masses 
"always rest easy" and are free from worries so that they can 
work boldly and energetically. While allowing "flexibility," we 
should keep to the direction of the market economy and provide 
positive guidance and excellent service in matters concerning 
investment, operational strategies, production and marketing 
information, and utilization of successful research results in 
science and technology. In developing the new economic points, 
we should not only pay attention to the speed and scale of 
development but also ensure the quality of work with a view to 
raising the economic returns. 
  The year 1994 is the first year for us to push all our work 
toward the establishment of a socialist market economy. This 
year our reform and development will embark on a new course. As 
the saying goes, "despite the difficulties involved, your 
efforts will bring you to success." As long as we strive to 
explore the way ahead of us, advance courageously, and grasp the 
new economic growth points firmly without letup, we are sure to 
make new breakthroughs in developing our province's socialist 
market economy.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Should Have the Spirit of Advancing in the </F>
Face of Difficulty"] 
  [Text] Advancing in the face of difficulty is a major part 
of the pioneering spirit and the way to succeed in all 
undertakings. It is also an impending requirement we have to 
meet in order to fulfill our tasks under the present 
circumstances. 
  The present economic situation, on the whole, is excellent 
in our province. Economic development has embarked on the 
"expressway." Since spring this year, our industry has grown at 
a rate higher than the nation's average. The status of 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy is being 
strengthened. And an excellent situation has appeared, marked by 
steady advances in all fields. In the course of advance, 
however, we are faced with some problems and difficulties. Chief 
among them are: a rather serious shortage of capital, the 
appearance of more "double suspension" enterprises [enterprises 
that have suspended production and wage payments to their 
employees], and an increased amount of losses suffered by some 
enterprises. Also, commodity prices have risen to an excessive 
extent; staff members and workers of the "double suspension" 
enterprises and masses in disaster-stricken areas are 
experiencing difficulty in livelihood. With regard to the 
relations of interests, contradictions of one kind or another 
have been intensified, and problems due to people's thinking and 
understanding have become more complicated. In view of this, we 
should keep a clear head so as to perceive the situation 
correctly. 
  There are two different attitudes toward difficulty and, 
hence, two different results. One is to advance in the face of 
difficulty, struggle hard, and step up efforts for reform and 
opening up to achieve great development. The other is to take 
the usual attitude toward work or even quit in the face of 
difficulty, and the result is to lag behind in competition. With 
respect to these two results, the leadership of the provincial 
party committee has stressed time and again that we must enhance 
our sense of urgency and historical responsibility and try to 
achieve the former and avoid the latter. At present, however, 
the problems are: Some people are in low spirits, pessimistic, 
and disheartened. Others are full of complaints and blame this 
and that. Still others assume a passive and perfunctory 
attitude, trying to evade problems if at all possible. Given 
this state of affairs, it is appropriate to say that our present 
difficulty is caused by the mentality and work style on the part 
of some cadres rather than by the tasks before us. 
  To advance in the face of difficulty, we should, first of 
all, look squarely at difficulty, despise it, and foster a 
dauntless spirit to conquer it. We should see the dual nature 
of difficulty: it is a motive force as well as a pressure; it 
not only causes us hardship but also provides something that we 
can take advantage of. Take the current macroeconomic 
environment as an example: Following two years' rapid economic 
growth, the "bottleneck" restriction and inflationary pressure 
have increased. On the one hand, our economic environment is not 
without strain. On the other hand, we have a new market economy 
marked by a high degree of vitality and compatibility, hence 
there are more opportunities for development. Moreover, despite 
the same environment, some units have remained passive and 
failed to go out of predicament, while others have overcome 
difficulties and "blazed a trail" through brambles. As a result, 
there have appeared in the province a number of counties, 
cities, and townships that have developed by leaps and bounds, 
"little tigers" that have excelled in developing the economy, 
and new enterprises that have arisen in the waves of market 
development. These positive and negative experiences show that 
the outcome of a matter depends on human efforts. Those who 
appear energetic and ambitious when circumstances are favorable 
but become discouraged and lose their bearings in the face of 
difficulty can never make any significant accomplishment or 
pioneer a great cause. 
  To advance in the face of difficulty, we should not evade 
problems. Instead, we should be daring and adept in tackling the 
main and prominent problems that affect our reform and 
development and make a serious effort to solve them. For 
instance, enlivening big and medium-sized state enterprises is a 
major and hard job at present. Some enterprises have entered the 
market to conduct transactions on property rights, thus 
relieving themselves from the "specially guaranteed units" 
status granted them under the planned economic system. Other 
enterprises have been transformed into joint stock companies, 
accepted foreign capital, organized conglomerates, or opened new 
business in the field of tertiary industry. Still others have 
leased or auctioned themselves to the "main task forces" for 
competent management. To press ahead and make breakthroughs in 
every work, we must dare to tackle problems and overcome 
difficulties. If we turn away and refuse to do anything when 
problems arise, we will not only be overwhelmed by difficulties 
and cannot perceive our real backwardness, but what is more, we 
will aggravate the difficulties, cause more problems, and even 
turn solvable problems into "longstanding, big, and 
hard-to-resolve issues." 
  To advance in the face of difficulty, we should also have 
perseverance in doing thoroughgoing work. We will not be able to 
overcome difficulty and achieve success if we take the usual 
attitude toward our work, dare not tackle the hard problems, or 
quit in the face of difficulty. For example, the "one-vote 
overruling" is a good way to remove difficulties in family 
planning. The "system of leaders taking responsibility for local 
security" is a good measure to improve public order. Using law 
to reduce the burden of enterprises and farmers is an effective 
method. To put these into practice, we should strive 
persistently and in a thoroughgoing way. Otherwise, we will 
waste our efforts or even spoil our previous achievements. Such 
a consequence will be hard to remedy. 
  Whether a cadre can advance in the face of difficulty is a 
test of his or her thinking and work style. To break through 
difficulty, cadres and masses should help each other, pool their 
efforts, and display a daring and heroic team spirit. When 
difficulty arises, if our leading cadres just look on with 
folded arms or talk indiscreetly, if they are indulged in 
extravagant feasting and wining and busy entertaining guests and 
sightseeing, or if they are merely enthusiastic about replacing 
their present vehicles with high-grade luxurious cars and about 
seeking "ease and comfort," then the masses will not respect 
them, and the difficulty will remain. What is more, their 
behavior will invite serious complaints from the masses and make 
the difficult problems even more difficult to solve. To sum up, 
we must strive to improve our mindset and work style and foster 
a spirit of advancing in the face of difficulty so as to exert 
ourselves to fulfill the objective of "revitalizing Hubei in 
central China."

<F P=106> [(Excerpts) of the Report of the Implementation of the Gansu </F>
Provincial 1993 Plan for National Economic and Social 
Development and the 1994 Plan] 
  [Excerpt] I. 
Implementation of 1993 Plan for Gansu Provincial Economic and 
Social Development 
  Gansu had maintained sustained and steady economic growth in 
1993, while strengthening macro-regulation and control, 
accelerating economic restructuring, insuring the completion of 
major construction projects and raising economic efficiency. At 
the same time, various social undertakings had made progress in 
a coordinated manner. the gross provincial product in 1993 
reached 34.9 billion yuan, up 10.7 percent over 1992, of which 
the primary industry grew 6.8 percent, the secondary industry 
10.9 percent and the tertiary industry 13.8 percent. 
  -- A bumper harvest was reaped in agriculture. The total 
grain output hit a record high, reaching 7.5 billion kg, an 
increase of 600 million kg over 1992. Rural enterprises made 
rapid progress with their output value amounting to 17.72 
billion yuan. They had overfulfilled the 50 percent target for 
growth set by the provincial CPC committee and the provincial 
government. The per capita peasant's net income reached 563 
yuan. The total industrial output value rose to 50.18 billion 
yuan, an increase of 14.7 percent. The output of major 
industrial products also saw vigorous growth with double-digit 
growth rates in the production of steel, nonferrous metal, raw 
coal and power generation. 
  -- Investments in fixed assets in the province totaled 11.24 
billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 32.1 percent, of which the 
primary industry grew 4.5 percent, the secondary industry 10.9 
percent and the tertiary industry 92.2 percent. Investments in 
basic infrastructure from local state-owned enterprises rose to 
2.61 billion yuan, an increase of 43.6 percent. Investments in 
developing renovations and technical transformation totalled 
1.21 billion yuan, up 9.8 percent. 
  -- The value of exports in 1993 totaled US$280 million. 
Contracts with foreign countries were concluded totaling US$523 
million. An actual US$290 million was put into use. The number 
of registered Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative and 
solely foreign-funded enterprises reached 723, of which 500 
started to operate in 1993. Their total investments reached 
US$960 million with US$400 million from foreign investors. 
  -- New progress was made in establishing markets. More than 
1,770 markets of all types for producer goods and rural bazaars 
were set up in the province, and their volume of business was 
valued at approximately 10 billion yuan. The value of retail 
sales in the province in 1993 reached 16.19 billion yuan, an 
increase of 20.4 percent over 1992; and revenues totalled 5.21 
billion yuan, up 30.5 percent. At the end of 1993, the total 
bank deposits rose by 4.62 billion yuan and loans were increased 
by 6.57 billion yuan. There were more localities in the province 
where experiments were carried out for the development of the 
shareholding system. The number of shareholding enterprises 
approved by the relevant provincial authorities reached 125. 
  While Gansu's economy is being developed, new progress was 
also made in the fields of science and technology, education, 
culture, public health, sports and other social undertakings. 
However, there remained some outstanding contradictions and 
problems in economic operation in 1993. 1) The agricultural 
foundation remained weak. Basic conditions for agricultural 
production had not been fundamentally improved. 2) Funds of all 
types were still insufficient. 3) There was a shortage of rail 
transportation. Sharp contradictions remained between 
transportation capacity and freight volume. 4) Some enterprises 
reported more losses and their economic efficiency remained low. 
5) The product mix of some outmoded enterprises in 
petrochemical, machine-building and textile industries was 
irrational because they lacked money to carry out renovations. 
6) General commodity prices continued to rise, lowering the 
living standards of some residents and peasants in 
poverty-stricken areas. 
<H5>  II. Guiding Thought and Main Targets for 1994 Plan </H5>
  The guideline set by the 1994 plan is to implement the 
guideline laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
National CPC Congress (Decision): work hard to carry out major 
reforms in all fields; open even wider to the outside world; 
base ourselves on both international and domestic markets, on 
two kinds of resources, on the two types of funds; and help 
enterprises change the way they operate, optimize their 
structure and raise their economic efficiency. We must utilize 
all available financial resources to develop major construction 
projects; continue to strengthen the foundation for agricultural 
production; quicken the pace in developing local industries, 
rural enterprises and the tertiary industry; maintain sustained, 
rapid and healthy development of the national economy; and 
promote economic and social development in a coordinated manner. 
  The main targets and tasks set in the 1994 plan for economic 
and social development in Gansu are as follows: 
  -- We should strive to increase the total production output 
value by 9.5 percent, of which the primary industry grows by 5 
percent (agricultural production output value by 5 percent), the 
secondary industry by 9.6 percent (industrial production output 
value by 9.6 percent) and the tertiary industry by 13 percent. 
  -- Gansu's investments in fixed assets should reach 9.69 
billion yuan at the beginning of 1994, which will mark an 
increase of 32.1 percent over 1993. Local investments in fixed 
assets should rise to 7.338 billion yuan, of which 5.24 billion 
yuan should come from state-owned units, an increase of 51.7 
percent; 991 million yuan should come from collectively owned 
units, an increase of 41.6 percent; and 1.1 billion yuan should 
come from individual investors, an increase of 22.2 percent. As 
for investments in fixed assets from state-owned units, funds 
earmarked for capital construction should reach 2.947 billion 
yuan, an increase of 66.2 percent; funds earmarked for technical 
innovations should reach 1.35 billion yuan, an increase of 17.4 
percent; funds earmarked for the construction of residential 
houses should reach 685 million yuan, an increase of 95.7 
percent; and other investments should reach 265 million yuan, an 
increase of 47.2 percent. 
  -- Financial revenues in the province should increase 
slightly to reach 5.35 billion yuan. 
  -- The total value of retail sales in Gansu should reach 
18.5 billion yuan, up 14.3 percent, while the inflation rate 
should be placed under control around 10 percent. 
  -- The plan sets the total value of imports and exports at 
US$472 million, an increase of 18 percent. It sets the target 
for exports at US$330 million and that for imports at US$142 
million of which the import of technologies will reach US$43 
million. 
  -- Population in the province should be controlled within 
23.85 million and the natural rate of population growth 14.9 
percent by the end of 1994. 
  -- The plan sets the per capita peasant's net income at 613 
yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. 
  By fulfilling the aforementioned targets for the provincial 
economy, Gansu will be able to make new progress and achieve, 
one year ahead of schedule, the goal set by the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan. [passage omitted]

(5105 1696 0061): "What Does 15.4 Billion Yuan Tell Us -- A Look 
Into the Nationwide Inspection of Tax Revenue, Financial 
Affairs, and Commodity Prices"] 
  [Text] The 1993 inspection of tax revenue, financial 
affairs and commodity prices in China revealed numerous 
violations of laws and regulations totaling 15.4 billion yuan, 
of which 10 billion yuan were recovered for the nation's 
treasury, a result which pleased us all. 
  But while we may rejoice over the success, we cannot help 
but 
be somewhat concerned, what does the 15.4 billion yuan really 
tell us? 
<H5>  A Series of Shocking Figures </H5>
  According to a report furnished by an authoritative source, 
analysis of the total monetary amount of tax and financial 
revenue violations uncovered in the 1993 inspection indicates 
that: 
  -- By method of inspection, 6.57 billion yuan or 42.8 
percent 
came from internal inspection by the enterprises and work units, 
and 8.79 billion yuan or 57.2 percent from outside inspection. 
The amounts of violations in the two categories are 2.39 billion 
yuan and 4.35 billion yuan respectively more than the amounts 
from the inspection the year before. 
  -- By type of tax evasion, 8 billion yuan or 52 percent were 
violations of tax collection regulations; 4.15 billion yuan or 
27 percent were violations of financial regulations; and 3.2 
billion yuan or 21 percent were violations of commodity pricing 
and other regulations. 
  -- By number of organizational units, 10,359 units had 
amounts of violations ranging between 50-100,000 yuan; 6,305 
units between 100-500,000 yuan; 986 units between 500,000 and 1 
million yuan; and 472 units in the range of 1 million yuan and 
over. 
  -- By province or city, Liaoning had amounts of violations 
totaling over 800 million yuan; Sichuan and Shanghai 
municipality over 700 million yuan; Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong 
and Jiangsu over 600 million yuan; Hebei, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang 
and Henan over 500 million yuan; Guangxi over 400 million yuan; 
and other provinces and cities such as Anhui, Beijing, Jilin, 
Jiangxi, Shanxi and Heilongjiang over 300 million yuan. 
<H5>  Key Objective of Violators of Law and Regulation: Tax Evasion </H5>
  In the series of nine annual inspections of tax and 
financial 
revenues and commodity prices, the monetary amount of violations 
uncovered each year reflects most clearly that the most serious 
violations are in tax collection area. Evasion and diversion of 
industrial, commercial and other taxes by enterprise units and 
the "two currencies" situation are particularly serious. 
  If the total monetary amount of tax violations from the 1993 
inspection were broken down by type, 6.183 billion yuan were 
industrial, commercial and other taxes; 1.85 billion yuan were 
income, regulatory and profits taxes; 1.187 billion yuan were 
diversion from active capital or reserves accounts of energy, 
transportation and key construction projects; the combined total 
of the above amounts to 9.22 billion yuan, 63.4 percent of the 
total monetary amount of violations. 
  Taxes have become the target of attack by those who violate 
the laws and regulations. As shown by relevant statistics and 
investigation into special areas, among the enterprise units 
that have been inspected, problems of tax evasion still exist in 
over 50 percent of the cases; whenever inspections are carried 
out in many local enterprises, particularly individually owned 
and operated industrial and commercial enterprises, cases of 
violation and tax evasion would invariably be uncovered. There 
was the case of a subsidiary firm of a certain agricultural 
production material company which, from beginning 1992 to 
September 1993, arbitrarily treated 8.04 million yuan of unspent 
dock service fees returned by an import company as an account 
payable amount, did not calculate its profits in a timely way as 
required by regulations, and evaded 4,422,000 million yuan in 
income taxes and diverted 904,500 yuan in "two currencies" for a 
total of 5,326,500 yuan. In south China, there was the case of a 
certain provincial postal and telecommunications bureau's trade 
service company which, from 1992 through the first half of 1993, 
using various methods such as repeatedly depreciating its 
equipment, hiding income receipts and under-reporting profits, 
was able to evade enterprise, income, city construction taxes, 
as well as "two currencies" and education fees totaling 
2,025,800 yuan. 
  Looking at the situation revealed by the inspections, 
enterprises that evade or divert over 1 million yuan in taxes 
are no longer uncommon. 
  The 1993 inspection revealed that the use of bogus invoices 
and real estate development and operations were the major 
sources of tax violations. 
  A certain city in Fujian Province undertook a special audit 
of 349 real estate development companies in the city, and found 
that by resorting to various tactics of not recording offshore 
receipts, treating real estate down payments as income-expense 
transactions, under-reporting for tax purposes the full amounts 
of real estate sold, treating land-for-property exchanges as 
noncash exchanges and not recorded in their books, these 
companies were able to evade large amounts of taxes totaling 
70.95 million yuan, averaging 203,000 yuan per company. One of 
these companies, by not recording offshore incomes of some 100 
million yuan, evaded as much as 3.03 million yuan in taxes. 
  In Guangxi, some real estate companies exploited the 
tax-free 
loophole by early closing of their accounts of capital and 
profits, exchanging property for land and building commercial 
property on it for another party without calculating the price, 
and recklessly organizing nominal subsidiary units; these 
companies, using such tactics and operating off the books, also 
evaded taxes by making long-term use of the monies they set 
aside to pay taxes as well as the monies collected from property 
purchasers as payment of taxes. 
  A certain development company collected in advance 51.20 
million yuan in down payments for property purchasers with the 
estimate that the project will be completed by 1994. But in 
order to qualify for the 1992 (income) tax exemption deadline, 
the company arbitrarily transferred 50.78 million yuan of down 
payments as receipts from sales, paid 2,507,000 yuan in advance 
for the enterprise tax, construction tax and education fees, and 
entered 23.8 million yuan of recovered capital and profits as 
"other accounts payable"; as a result, the company was able to 
evade 17,135,700 yuan in income taxes due in 1993-1994. 
  The inspection discovered the rather serious problem of some 
real estate companies delaying tax payments for long periods of 
time. One company, since 1988, had collected 19,126,000 yuan of 
advance down payments from its customers, and although the 
properties had long since been turned over to the buyers, the 
company only recorded 5,36,3400 million as sales in 1990, paid a 
business tax of 168,700 yuan and put off paying the rest of the 
business tax, construction tax and "two currencies" totaling 
almost 3 million yuan. 
  The phenomenon of using bogus invoices to evade taxes is 
also 
shocking. A certain city in Zhejiang Province, in the process of 
inspection, discovered that 799 companies had invoice violations 
amounting to a total of as much as 320 million yuan. In one 
district, nine labor service companies, which specialized in 
recruiting peasants to work as "clerks," peddled to various 
government departments and other enterprise employers a total of 
1,918 invoices in January-September 1992, and out of a total of 
130 million yuan of invoices they evaded 4.14 million yuan of 
taxes. Those who used the invoices could enter whatever monetary 
figures, including large sums, as desired. 
<H5>  Shocking Diversions </H5>
  If evading and under-reporting taxes is the main objective 
of 
those who violate laws and regulations, then diverting national 
income to private use is undoubtedly their second objective. 
  In Sichuan Province, from 1922 to September 1933, a 
supervisory department without authorization diverted various 
taxes it had collected for transmission to the Central 
Government to its own use as administrative expenses, fees for 
labor association and meal subsidies for staff employees, and as 
much as 4,508,000 million was so spent. A certain social welfare 
bureau in Hebei violated regulations by arbitrarily diverting 
3.37 million yuan from the workers pension fund using it in 
other business investment activities. The agricultural committee 
in one district in the Guangxi autonomous region, from January 
1990 to May 1993, violated government financial regulations by 
taking as much as 388,200 yuan of income received from 
sponsorship, labor services, operating its own enterprises and 
compensation for contract violations, and using the money off 
the books for business; the money created a "small treasury" 
which earned 162,300 yuan by May 1993, and the rest of the money 
was used for installing telephones, wining and dining and other 
social activities. A fuel supply company in a certain province 
privately set up a "small treasury" with 1,033,600 yuan. Since 
1991, that company without authorization collected a total of 
315,400 yuan in fees by issuing permits for shipping charcoal 
and coal not allocated for in the provincial plan; by using 
various tactics, the company went into joint operation with 
out-of-province enterprises and divided among them 302,600 yuan 
of profits; they acquired properties and fixed assets at 
negotiated prices and transferred a total of 1,033,600 yuan into 
the company's "small treasury." Up to the time of the 
inspection, transactions in the "small treasury" totaled 545,700 
yuan, most of which are in the form of IOU's and are issued and 
used at random. 
  And even worst, the general operations department of a 
certain railroad bureau diverted and hid profits from various 
operations totaling 10,326,000 yuan, a serious diversion of 
funds belong to the government. 
  The 1993 inspection also revealed other phenomena and 
activities of violations of law and regulations that are 
shocking. 
  The situation of government administrative units blindly 
collecting all kinds of fees is very serious. A municipal 
planning committee in Guangxi charged investors engineering 
consulting fees at the rate of 1 percent of the investment 
amounts, and collected a total of 2,524,400 yuan between 1992 
and August 1993, which added additional burden on the 
enterprises and caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some 
people compared this to the saying of "building a nest to 
attract wind" before any investors show up and, when the "wind" 
comes, "climbing in the nest and plucking feathers," a bitter 
pill indeed for investors to swallow. 
  The unauthorized issuance of various commodity certificates 
in lieu of cash is still going on. There was the case of nine 
large markets in a certain locality in Yunnan which, after the 
State Council issued the directive to stop issuance of such 
certificates in 1993, nevertheless and without authorization 
issued over 16.5 million yuan of such cash-substitute 
certificates. When a large quantity of such certificates were 
put in use, they became a kind of "cash substitutes" which wreck 
havoc in the normal financial order; at the same time, when 
goods are sold, it gave purchasing units the opportunity to use 
fake receipts for the "electronic products," "labor welfare 
service" and "office use equipment." 
<H5>  Establishing and Perfecting a System of Strict Financial </H5>
Supervision 
  The fact that a total of 15.4 billion yuan in tax evasion 
was 
uncovered in the 1933 inspection of tax revenues, financial 
affairs and commodity prices leaves people with this thought: 
there is no time to lose to establish and perfect a system of 
strict financial supervision. 
  We should recognize that China's current system of financial 
supervision is not well suited for economic reform and 
development of a market economy. On the one hand, violations in 
the financial area are quite serious, and constitute a sickness 
which in the long term will affect the economy; in the nine 
annual inspections, almost every one uncovered violations 
amounting to more than 10 billion yuan; on the other hand, 
because supervision and inspection of financial activities are 
inadequate and uncoordinated, the various relevant supervisory 
bodies are not enforcing policies and regulations in comparable 
degrees; in inspection, existing regulations have not strictly 
enforced and cases not forcefully executed, all of which are not 
conducive to maintaining strict financial supervision. 
  Finally, it is clear that we urgently need to establish as 
soon as possible a system of properly coordinated financial 
supervision with a clear division of labor that will be highly 
effective in its execution.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuan Hong (7086 4767): "Communications Bank </F>
Comprehensively Develops International Business--Accelerates 
Pace of Getting on International Track"] 
  [Text] "The Communications Bank will make the promotion of 
international financial business an important part of its 
accelerated development, and in business administration and 
management accelerate its pace of getting on the international 
track; over a period of time it will make an effort to become a 
transnational bank with a fairly high degree of international 
capital and credit, and then ascend further to become an example 
of a world-class bank." This was the clear demand put forward by 
Wang Mingquan [3769 2494 2938], president of the Communications 
Bank, at the bank's 1994 foreign exchange work conference. 
  The foreign exchange business of the Communications Bank is 
now conducted in 50 branch banks in 22 provinces and cities 
throughout China. The bank has set up branch banks and 
representative offices in the main international financial 
centers of Asia, North and South America, and Europe. Globally, 
it has 808 agent banks and close to 100 overseas account banks. 
The total number of its settled accounts has broken through the 
$10 billion barrier, and on three occasions it has successfully 
floated in Singapore the issuance of U.S. dollar bonds at a 
floating interest rate. Faced with the daily intensifying 
turbulent internatonal financial markets, this bank's foreign 
exchange buying and selling, releasing of funds, bond 
transactions, and other business with foreign exchange funds, 
under the premise of ensuring the security of the funds, have 
increased profits, thereby further improving the bank's 
investment skills. At the same time, there has been a new 
development of its foreign exchange business, in succession 
pushing and spreading a series of loan types, including leases, 
mixed loan credit transfers, and foreign exchange borrowings. 
  Following the establishment of the Commercial Bank's 
position 
in China's financial system, the development of the 
Communications Bank faced a new "flight of steps." At the end of 
last year, the reform and development plan proposed by this bank 
was approved by the People's Bank of China; and for the 
Communications Bank to vigorously develop its international 
financial business and to be run as an export-oriented, 
standardized commercial bank is an important strategic idea in 
the plan. For this reason, starting this year, the bank will, in 
accordance with the successful pattern and standard of 
international practice and international commercial banks, 
implement unified systems, unified technological processes, 
unified operations, and unified certificates in its foreign 
exchange business administration and management; and take the 
lead in adopting current international methods in the aspects of 
foreign exchange quoted prices and foreign exchange funds. The 
bank is getting a tight grip on carrying out international 
credit rating and is doing well the work of raising funds 
overseas. This year it will set up two representative offices in 
Singapore and Frankfurt. 
  To ensure the healthy development of its international 
financial business, the Communications Bank has proposed a 
series of measures for strengthening internal risk management 
and for ensuring the quality of foreign exchange assets. At the 
same time, it will put the cultivation of export-oriented 
talented persons in an extremely important positon; cooperate 
with colleges and universities in offering foreign language 
courses and foreign exchange business courses; continue to study 
and do fieldwork in overseas branch banks; and set up 
competitive mechanisms and exciting mechanisms for foreign 
exchange talents.

<F P=106> [Article by Yen Tz'u (6056 5417): "Shanghai Speeds Up </F>
Transition Toward Its Goal of Becoming an International 
Financial Center'"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: In early 1992, Shanghai 
clearly set forth its strategic goal of developing into "an 
international financial center" by the year 2010, including this 
in its urban development plans. In a short two years, Shanghai 
has first achieved spectacular breakthrough advances in 
expanding its money market scale. 
<H5>  Shanghai Makes Plans in 1992 for Developing Into a </H5>
"Financial Center" 
  Financial reform had become imperative for China as to 
needs, 
such as marketizing the Chinese economy, spurring the economy 
"onto an international track," and taking better part in world 
economic circulation. The choice of a location with geograpahic 
advantages and a sizeable industrial base, in which to carry out 
this reform first, by developing a standardized money market, 
had become an especially important "contact" linking China to 
the outside world. The Chinese economy's decade-plus of 
developments and realities had determined this choice to be 
Shanghai. 
  Deng Xiaoping, who had celebrated the Spring Festival in 
Shanghai for seven or eight years in a row, has always paid 
attention to Shanghai's reform and economic development. He 
pointed out in 1991 that: "Finance is very important, being the 
crux of a modern economy. Just as Shanghai used to be a 
financial center, a place of currency convertibility, it will be 
so again in the future. If China is to acquire international 
standing in finance, it will have to rely first on Shanghai." 
He went on to say that "we must begin now." In fact, while 
Shanghai was fully capable of undertaking this important 
mission, having conducted certain financial reforms earlier than 
the rest of China, it has taken genuinly bold reform steps only 
in the last two or three years. In early 1992, Shanghai 
clearly set forth its strategic goal of developing into "an 
international financial center" by the year 2010, including this 
in its urban development plans. 
  Through a burst of effort, Shanghai has first achieved 
spectacular breakthrough advances in expanding its money market 
scale. 
  The signs show that a long- and short-term money market 
system in mostly areas, such as securities, lending, and foreign 
exchange conversion, has begun to take shape in Shanghai. The 
Shanghai Stock Exchange has over 420 member companies everywhere 
throughout China. It has nearly 200 listed securities, of which 
140 are listed stocks, almost one-third of which are in outside 
companies that were sold to foreigners. In 1993, its stock 
trading value topped 500 billion yuan, up seven times from 1992. 
On 11 March 1994, its stock trading value set a one-day record 
of 3.9 billion yuan, RMB and similarly hereinafter). 
Shanghai's stock market has become a veritable national 
market. Some hold that it is already showing signs of becoming 
a large Far Eastern and world-class market. 
<H5>  Foreign Banks Swarm to Shanghai's Bund </H5>
  In 1993, Shanghai loaned over 232.9 billion RMB, while 
discounitng and rediscounting by Shanghai financial institutions 
amounted to more than 22 billion RMB. Its lending net has spread 
from the eastern zone to all of China. 
  The most recent figures show that Shanghai's foreign 
exchange 
conversion center conducted transactions in 1993 worth $5.294 
billion, making 1993 its biggest year since its opening in 1988. 
In the first seven trading days of 1994, its foreign exchange 
conversion transactions reached $126 million, making for a brisk 
and stable foreign exchange market. To help Sino-foreign joint 
ventures avoid risks, Shanghai also began foreign exchange 
futures services in 1993, with the Shanghai branch of the Bank 
of China recently establishing a "foreign exchange treasure" 
service with a more than 10-percent discount for individual 
foreign exchange transactions, immediately invigorating 
individual foreign currency trading, with the first 10 days of 
1994 bringing a transaction value of nearly $2 million. This 
conversion center has also completed its linkup with six key 
domestic cities. The first national foreign exchange market 
established on these grounds will open soon. 
  In the near future, Shanghai's decisive money market 
standing 
and role in China and even the Far East will be emphasized 
similarly by the international business world. Foreign banks and 
financial institutions have competed to swarm into Shanghai in 
recent years, becoming a large part of Shanghai's landscape. 
  Since financial institutions, such as Japan's Sanwa Bank and 
Societe Generale, the U.S. Huaqi [5363 2475] Bank, France's 
Oriental Exchange Bank, Britain's Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking 
Corp, and the Sino-foreign joint ventures of the Shanghai-Paris 
International Bank and the Shanghai International Financial 
Corp, were allowed to set up branches in Shanghai in 1991, 
foreign financial institutions have come one after another to 
set up on Shanghai's Bund. By now, 26 foreign banks have 
opened branches in Shanghai, with 56 others from throughout the 
world having set up representative offices in Shanghai, waiting 
for permission to "upgrade." Shanghai has become mainland 
China's province or municipality with the most foreign and 
domestic financial institutions, with statistics showing that by 
the end of 1993, foreign financial institutions had assets in 
Shanghai totaling $3.2 billion, or three times that of 1992. 
Shanghai had by the end of 1993 a foreign exchange deposit 
balance of $470 million, and a foreign exchange loan balance of 
$1.296 billion, both of which figures were up 150 percent from 
1992. 
<H5>  Shanghai's "Bund" Regains Its Significance </H5>
  Shanghai's existing over 6,600 foreign-funded enterprises 
undoubtedly provide forceful business support for foreign 
financial institutions. Foreign banks act as intermediaries in 
attracting foreign investment to Shanghai, as well as providing 
services for the Shanghai region in areas, such as export 
settlement and import accounting. In the last one or two years, 
foreign financial institutions have used their respective 
advantages to participate enthusiastically with international or 
Chinese banking consortiums in lending, in support of Shanghai's 
large and mid-sized state enterprise production. For 
instance, 10 Sino-foreign financial institutions, such as the 
Netherlands Trading Bank, leading the way, the Shanghai Pudong 
Development Bank, and the Lyons Credit Bank, have participated 
in financing, providing $50 million in seven-year commercial 
loans to Pudong's Waigaoqiao power plant; the Shanghai branch of 
the BOC has taken the lead in foreign bank participation in 
providing loans to projects, such as $60 million to Shanghai's 
Yongxin Color Display Imaging Corp Ltd. Since the U.S. 
Friendship Insurance Company began operation in Shanghai, its 
business has become ever brisker, making it a strong competitive 
adversary to Shanghai's existing state-owned insurance 
companies. In early 1994, the U.S. Huaqi Bank was the first to 
move its Chinese head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. While 
the French Lyons Credit Bank has just been officially named, its 
first action involved its Chinese head office. All of this 
shows that Shanghai is actually already demonstrating the 
standing and role of a regional financial center. 
  In order to step up to its goal of becoming an 
"international 
financial center," Shanghai is now taking a series of steps to 
speed up this process. 
  The "Bund" is a symbol of the international significance of 
the metropolis of Shanghai. Its cluster of tall buildings in 
grand style towering along the banks of the Huangpu Jiang 
[River] has played roles varying with the changing times. At 
one time, it was seen as a symbol of "imperalist aggression." 
Later, its fine regional environment made it a tourist 
destination. However, its genuine role in setting off 
Shanghai's march toward achieving its goal of becoming a modern 
international metropolis needs reacknowledged. 
<H5>  A Financial District Rebuilds on the Banks of the Huangpu </H5>
Jiang 
  Records show that of the tall buildings towering along the 
Bund, 113 were originally bank buildings, making the Bund the 
site of old Shanghai's most concentrated financial institutions. 
Since Shanghai set its goal of developing into an 
"international financial center," the Bund has been included in 
its development plans, to be developed along with the "small 
Lujiazui" district across the river into Shanghai's "central 
business district." Its row of tall buildings is being returned 
to their true "financial" colors. So at the end of 1993, 
Shanghai set up the "Shanghai Municipal Building Replacement 
Corporation." This company will sell these large buildings in 
forms, such as invitation of bids, auctions, and agreements. 
Once this news was released, domestic financial institutions 
rushed to get in on it first, with the former "Central Bank" 
that later became the location of the "Spaceflight Tower" now 
becoming the "China Foreign Exchange Trading Center," and the 
Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 
occupying a key location. The Shanghai Municipal Government 
has now built a tower in People's Square, and is expected to 
move its offices there within the year from their current 
location (the former Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp tower). 
When Shanghai's foreign financial institutions heard the news, 
they also came in streams to make arrangements. Banks such as 
the U.S. Morgan Bank and Huaqi Bank, the Swiss National Bank, 
the French Lyons Bank, and the Oriental Exchange Bank, were the 
first to take action. It is understood that Shanghai is drawing 
up the first draft of a legal document concerning the many 
problems involved in the Bund's building replacement, to help to 
standardize the work. 
  Speeding up the computerization of its banking industry is 
also an effective step being taken by the Shanghai Municipal 
Government. Since the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China put 
out Mainland China's first credit card, the "Great Wall Card," 
in 1987, five credit cards from various banks are now in 
circulation, with cardholder consumption topping 1 billion RMB a 
year. But as cardholding by special business firms and 
available ATMs were still too small-scale, the Shanghai branch 
of the People's Bank of China set up and organized in 1993 the 
Shanghai Credit Card Network Corp Ltd, to issue "Gold Cards." By 
the end of 1993, it had begun to complete the establishment of 
an ATM/POS joint-network information system. Once all credit 
cards throughout Shanghai are linked to this network, there will 
be a new market order. In addition, the various categories of 
services available to Shanghai banking circles over the 
long-distance satellite communications system are growing 
steadily. The Shanghai Stock Exchange's long-distance 
communications network has now linked up all provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions except for the Taiwan 
region, with its transaction and settlement accuracy and speed 
already up to the most advanced world stock market level of T + 
0 [formula as published]. 
  Moreover, Shanghai's promotion of reform to convert 
specialized banks to commercial ones is also now in intense 
progress. In the new Pudong zone, the operating style of the 
11 biggest Chinese-owned financial institutions througout China 
is already quite flexible, with the Shanghai, Pudong Development 
Bank, operating completely according to international banking 
standards, being China's first local shareholding bank. In less 
than a year after its establishment, its assets have reached 6 
billion RMB, drawing increased public respect. 
  Driven by rapid money market development, Shanghai's related 
intermediary service agencies, such as stock companies, 
accounting, auditing, and legal offices, credit evaluators, 
notaries, arbitrators, and information advisors, are also 
developing very quickly, ranking first in China as to numbers, 
thus forming a quite complete service system.

<F P=106> [Article: "Is It Depressed or Stable? An Analysis of China's </F>
Stock Market"] 
  [Excerpt] Editor's Note The stock market 
is extraordinarily sensitive. The investment psychology of major 
economic decision makers and of the shareholding public may 
cause stock market fluctuations. Conversely, stock market 
developments also have a certain affect on the decisions of 
decision makers and the shareholding public. For some time since 
the beginning of 1994, the stock market has been at low ebb. How 
this should be regarded -- is it depressed or is it stable? -- 
requires calm analysis. Both the decision making level and the 
shareholding public must maintain a clear head to make prudent 
decisions. 
  Although China's stock markets got off to a good start 
during 
the first week of 1994, during the remaining three weeks of 
January, the overall share price index on the Shanghai and 
Shenzhen markets continue to slide. By 28 January, the overall 
share price index on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had 
fallen 13.62 and 11.87 points respectively. This brings to mind 
1993 when the share price index for the year fluctuated within a 
narrow range, and groups active in the share market 
(shareholders, share evaluators, and securities traders) reacted 
the same way as the share price index, reaching the conclusion 
that China's stock markets had entered a depressed and turbid 
state. 
  The author disagrees. On the contrary, he feels that China's 
stock markets are not depressed but stable. 
  Manifestations of the Stability of China's Stock Markets 
  First, for the year as a whole, the stock markets made 
virtually no big leaps during 1993. The Shanghai overall share 
price index bobbed around near 900 points, and the Shenzhen 
overall share price index mostly shifted around 250 points. The 
share price index projects the best picture of market activity. 
No matter whether it goes up or down, so long as there are no 
alarmingly dangerous leaps, when the share price index moves 
gradually within relative limits -- including a gradually 
decline -- one should feel optimistically that the stock market 
is exhibiting a stable trend. Even though the overall view is 
that the stock market trend was toward a slide in 1993, this 
slide was gradual, and fluctuations were not great. This was the 
most direct manifestation of the stability of China's stock 
markets. 
  Second, no major surprises occurred in China's stock markets 
during 1993. This precluded the most direct reasons for stock 
market upheavals. Such a beneficial situation was the best 
possible reminder for those engaged in stock market activity. 
Thus those who directly played a part in stock market activity 
were in a peaceful frame of mind and went about their business 
in a steady way to lay the foundation for stability in China's 
stock markets. Though some buying wars occurred during 1993, and 
some spurious information circulated, causing tumult in the 
stock market, the vigorous intervention of the authorities and 
the close cooperation of shareholders promptly defused the 
problem to eliminate disturbances. Thus, China's stock markets 
showed stability. 
  Third, 5 billion shares were issued publicly, and they were 
sold in every city in the country. Such an action was 
unprercedented since founding of the people's republic. 
Furthermore, the safe, orderly, and complete fulfillment of this 
task even more inspired people. In addition, by comparison with 
1992, listings of A shares by the Shanghai and Shenzhen 
exchanges totaled 174 for a 2.35 fold increase. Listings of B 
shares by the two exchanges totaled 41 for a 1.28 fold increase. 
Listings of the shares of juridical entities totaled 17 for a 
4.67 fold increase. This manifold issuing and listing activity 
greatly eased the discrepancy between supply and demand in 
China's stock markets, and the whole process was completed 
without fanfare. This is the best indicator of the stability of 
China's stock markets. 
  Fourth, departments in charge of negotiable securities 
recently announced that 5.5 billion shares of stock would be 
issued openly during 1994. This loosening of the "share supply" 
strongly confirms the government's confidence in the stability 
and momentum of China's stock markets. It may be further 
inferred that it is only because of the stability of China's 
stock markets that the government is extremely pleased, and has 
the assurance needed to increase the issuance of shares by 5.5 
billion. If one assumes that China's stock markets are depressed 
rather than stable, it is very difficult to imagine that the 
government would loosen rather than tighten the "share supply." 
(Note: The author has coined the term "share supply," from the 
term "money supply." It applies to the amount of shares issued. 
If the amount issued is large, this is termed a loosening of the 
share supply and vice versa). 
  Reasons for the Stability of China's Stock Markets 
  1. Gradual Founding and Improvement of the Legal System. The 
turbulence in China's stock markets of recent years attests to 
the truth of the saying that "without rules, nothing can be done 
well." Consequently, once China's stock markets suffered 
setbacks and had to try harder, the establishment and perfection 
of stock market laws and regulations became a priority matter 
for the Chinese Government. The "Temporary Regulations on the 
Regulation of Stock Share Issuance and Trading," which the State 
Council promulgated in April 1993, and "Corporation Law of the 
People's Republic of China," which the NPC promulgated in 
December 1993, are notable examples. This brought the Chinese 
share system and stocks markets under legal regulation for the 
first time. Today, the number of national level documents 
pertaining to share system laws and regulations, articles, 
provisional regulations, etc. number more than 20. In addition, 
the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and in every 
jurisdiction in the country have drawn up regulations and 
articles that apply to their own circumstances, thereby 
beginning to shape a legal system for China's share system and 
stock markets, which lays a foundation for the stability of 
China's stock markets. 
  2. Loosening share supply to ease the share shortage. It 
must 
be admitted that the doubling and redoubling of share prices of 
the past several years has been extremely abnormal. The main 
reason for this was a tightening of the money supply which 
produced a huge gap between the supply and demand for shares. 
The issuance of 5 billion worth of shares in 1993 eased the 
supply problem and expanded listings somewhat, giving more 
shareholders a chance to take part in stock market operation. 
Therefore, the fall in share prices is entirely normal; the 
stock market positively should not be blamed. Loosening of the 
share supply has been an effective means of stabilizing China's 
stock markets. 
  3. Determined Stamping Out of Illegal Trading. Illegal 
trading (including insider trading and trading between legal 
entities without approval, people issuing and trading shares 
unauthorizedly outside the market) poses an extremely great 
threat to the legal trading of shares inside markets. It can 
indirectly influence popular feeling and damage confidence, or 
even cause a hedging flow of share capital inside or outside the 
market, which can become a damaging factor that causes market 
upheavals. In 1993, the Chinese Government resolutely stamped 
out spontaneous illegal black market trading, thereby ensuring 
the stability of China's stock markets. 
  4. Crackdown on Speculation, Improving Supervision and 
Control. Improper speculation will directly set off market 
upheavals. For example, spreading of false information, insider 
trading, cross trading, and abuse of official position to obtain 
shares are all within the category of improper speculation. Any 
such conduct can alter the direction of flow of share capital 
causing one party to rejoice at the expense of another party's 
sadness, thereby making the market fluctuate abnormally. In 
1993, the authorities concerned adopted measures and took action 
to control the quality of information passed around, and 
seriously punished offenders. They also firmly enforced the 
"Three Impartials" [sangong 0005 0361] principle, thereby 
reducing deer [lu 7773] markets to stabilize the stock markets. 
  5. Wringing the Water Out of the Stock Markets. The sharp 
increase in share prices during recent years has been complex. 
Therefore, the primary and secondary market share price, and 
market value are seriously at odds with original value causing a 
bubble phenomenon. The 1993 increase in shares and various 
measures gradually squeezed water out of the stock market, 
eliminating the bubble phenomenon for a great narrowing of the 
gap between the original share price and the primary and 
secondary market share price. This has restored the original 
value of shares. It is a major element in stock market 
stabilization. 
  6. Open and Fair Issuance of Subscription Forms. The 
shortage 
of shares and the even worse shortage of subscription forms led 
directly to the "10 August affair." In 1993, subscription forms 
were issued openly and fairly, most forms being issued in 
unlimited numbers so that everyone had an opportunity to buy 
shares. It dispelled the concentration in the hands of a few of 
opportunities to buy, narrowed the difference between the 
issuing price and the list price, and successfully suppressed 
subscription form scalping and stock scalping by large illegal 
traders, thereby creating stable conditions for truthfulness in 
stock price listings. 
  7. Gradual Maturation of Shareholders. Risk awareness has 
become a part of most shareholders. Haphazard coat tailing, 
stock churning, and other stupidities are no longer in vogue in 
the stock market. Many shareholders are not adept at analyzing 
the market and entering in prudently. Consequently, it is only 
natural that the stock market is stable. 
  8. Rise in Bank Interest Rates and Issuance of Government 
Bonds. The continuous rise in bank interest rates in less than 
two months during 1993, and the issuance of 30 billion yuan 
worth of government bonds immobilized most savings, thereby 
causing a severe shortage of funds for share speculation. 
Interest rates stood up well to share dividends. When people 
compared their confidence in the banks with stock market risk, 
they chose the banks. In a certain sense, both bank funds and 
stock market funds stabilized. 
  9. A fine political and economic situation. During 1993, 
virtually no serious political or economic ups and downs 
occurred. In particular, the macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures of June, and the assumption that the market 
economy would continue were keystones in the creation of stock 
market stability. 
  Reasons for the Mistaken Notion That the Stock Markets 
Are Depressed 
  Just why is it that some people have come to the conclusion 
that China's stock markets are depressed? 
  1. Lopsided comparisons with the past several years. What 
have the past several years been like? During 1990 and 1991, 
share prices increased manifold. Against the special background 
of the times, stock market operation was completely askew. Some 
people's rambling summarization of experiences in stock 
speculation at that time make others laugh when they think about 
it. It was less a boom than chaos. And today? Thanks to the 
building of a legal system and other factors, particularly the 
gradual increase in the number of shares issued and market 
trading, China's stock markets have become routine. The spread 
between primary and secondary market prices is also reasonable. 
As a result, wild rises in share prices have naturally 
disappeared. If one makes a lopsided comparison with this state 
of affairs, of course he will reach the conclusion that the 
stock markets are depressed. However, what we need is stability 
and not the chaos of a false boom. 
  2. Misunderstanding of the Expansion of Stock Market 
Capacity. China's share system must be resolutely continued. 
Expansion of stock market capacity is inevitable. Some people 
feel that the expansion of capacity led to stock market 
depression. This is a biased view. During the last half of 1993, 
stock market expansion was particularly intense yet the markets 
did not falter dramatically. The overall share price index on 
the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges hovered around the 870 and 
250 mark. Moreover, it was precisely this expansion of capacity 
that eased the share supply problem, suppressed speculation, 
brought in many new shareholders, and created conditions for 
enterprise share system scale operation. If any difference about 
depression and stability remain, that is bound to produce a 
misunderstanding about this expansion. No matter, continuing to 
expand stock market capacity is the inevitable result of the 
on-going development of share system pilot projects. 
  3. Efforts To Solidify Personal Benefits. Some old 
shareholders and securities traders are prone to feel that the 
stock markets are depressed. This is because of the following: 
1) As a result of the release of large amounts of share capital, 
returns from the shares they hold have depreciated rapidly; 2) 
when the cost index of shareholdings if fairly high, it is 
difficult to attract shareholders to buy and sell; 3) the leeway 
for speculation is reduced; 4) the market price and the original 
price are close, which slows trading and reduces securities 
traders' trading fees; 5) idle funds enter the market gingerly, 
securities traders' business volume declining as a result. For 
the foregoing reasons, both old shareholders and some securities 
traders' vested interests and incremental increase in returns 
are eroded. In order to solidify their personal interests, they 
naturally hope that the more the market "booms" the better, and 
the less market capacity expands the better, because in both 
cases they can reap tremendous returns in the long run. 
Because of their business interest, they naturally have a 
pessimistic view. 
  Conclusions and Suggestions 
  1. The author positively does not advocate an unabated slide 
in the share price index but rather stands for a correct 
understanding of current market conditions. The author hopes 
that the share price index will gradually rise, but not shoot 
up; otherwise a share price decrease in the future will mean 
greater losses for trading groups engaged in stock market 
activity. 
  2. We should cherish the stable and favorable stock market 
situation. The media and stock market trading groups should not 
one-sidedly fan a stock market "boom." A stable stock market is 
important to China's social stability, and it is also the key to 
intensifying trials of the share system. One must understand 
that maintenance of stock market stability is no easy matter, 
and that its destruction may occur in an instant. Furthermore, 
its destruction may rock the whole society. 
  3. We must continue to build and perfect applicable laws and 
regulations, persist in the expansion of capacity, adhere to the 
unlimited issuance of subscription forms, continue to loosen the 
share supply, use bank interest rates and treasury returns 
ingeniously, improve use of bank interest rates and treasury 
bond returns, improve supervision and control, and stamp out 
illegal trading. Then China's stock markets will certainly be 
stable, and will move in the direction of a real boom.

<F P=106> [Article in "Observation and Thought" column by He Shouguang </F>
(6320 1108 0342): "Warning: Misplacement of Moral Concepts in 
Contemporary China"] 
  [Text] Marx said: The price of society's advance is always 
the sacrifice of some traditional morals. This is true. In 
recent years China has greatly developed its economy, a 
development that has been the focus of world attention; at the 
same time it has also made a big sacrifice of its traditional 
morals. Some of them deserved to be sacrificed and should have 
been sacrificed. For example, the birth concept of "there are 
three things that are unfilial, and to have no posterity is the 
greatest of them"; the marriage concept of "a woman must be 
faithful to one husband all her life"; the economic concept of 
"the gentleman does not manage money matters, and the scholar 
does not engage in commerce"--etc. But there are some concepts 
that do not deserve to be sacrificed and should not be 
sacrificed. For example, the major misplacement of the concepts 
of honor and disgrace has already endangered the entire nation's 
moral system, and this requires a high degree of attention and 
vigilance on our part. 
  Misplacement of concepts of advanced and backward. 
Now, in the eyes of many people, being backward is not 
disgraceful and being advanced is not honorable. It is hard to 
be an advanced person: People do not like to do advanced deeds 
or speak advanced things. Some people hide the good deeds they 
do, fearing that if the deeds were known they would be the 
target of other people's freezing irony and biting satire. In 
the sixties, whoever found a wallet and returned it to its owner 
would win everybody's respect; today, whoever did this would be 
considered by people to be a "fool." In the sixties a "living 
Lei Feng" was an honorific; now, in many situations it has 
become a term of disparagement. If someone, irrespective of 
remuneration, does something to help the public good, someone 
else will mock him with a sneer: "Are you a living Lei Feng who 
is studying and using Mao Zedong Thought?" A "living Lei Feng" 
has become a synonym for someone who is foolish and stupid and 
who does not make money and is not good at gaining his own 
interests. It is precisely those people who haggle over every 
penny and who are insatiable whom, on the contrary, are looked 
upon by everybody as capable, skilled, and having a head for 
economics. Even mischievous people who do not abide by law or 
discipline, who do not obey leaders, and who "curse the mother 
while sucking the breast" have actually become heroes in the 
eyes of many people. Backward people no longer fear other 
people's criticism of their backwardness. If one of them is 
called a "backward element," his face does not turn red with 
embarassment, and he could, not without some pride, ask in 
return: "Advanced element, do you have money?" 
  Misplacement of civilized behavior and ignorant 
behavior. Smoking and spitting anywhere in a public place 
are clearly uncivilized acts, and to strengthen the supervision 
and control over them is, without a doubt, correct. However, in 
bus and train stations, markets, cinemas and theaters, and even 
street corners, some people are often observed spitting anwhere 
they like and smoking indiscriminately, and they are not 
educated or fined by control personnel. Public opinion on the 
scene is often unfavorable to the controller while being 
sympathetic and supportive of those who disobey the controllers. 
It is also natural that car drivers who break the law by running 
red lights, not fastening safety belts, and not parking in 
designated places should be educated and fined. But public 
opinion on the scene always sides with the lawbreaker, and 
generally likens the police to "dogs trying to catch mice"--too 
meddlesome. Some people do not care for their elders when the 
latter are alive, but give them elaborate funerals when they 
die, commiting a lot of property to the flames and even burning 
Renminbi as an offering to the dead. Their behavior is extremely 
benighted, and is regarded by people as filial piety carried to 
a ridiculous extreme... and so on and so forth. 
  Misplacement of thrift and extravagance. Thrift is 
a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, but at times it 
seems to have become a synonym for the "small peasant's economic 
mentality." Extravagance is generally acknowledged as stylish 
and daring. The news media has even admired and publicized 
"golden banquets," "schools for aristocrats," as well as 
high-spending, lavish styles of consumption. For a considerably 
long period of time, when we publicize the excellent situation 
in the rural areas we will talk about how the peasants compare 
each other's wealth, which symbolizes the "soft" criteria for a 
peasant's wealth -- "nutrition in eating, smartness in clothes, 
and high quality in what is used," publicizing the starting up 
of markets and the stimulation of economic development by means 
of high consumption. The formulation "being thrifty and 
economical is a virtue" has already almost been forgotten. The 
tenet "being economical" means being incompetent and that one 
should stage "luxurious" scenes derive from the concept that 
"poverty is shameful and wealth is honorable." Therefore, some 
people, even if heavily in debt, have to slap their own faces 
and compare themselves to other people in what they eat, wear, 
and use. Those who are officials compare their sedans, housing, 
and .... 
  Misplacement of honesty and dishonesty. Because of 
the objectively existing phenomenon of "flogging the fast cows," 
officials in some places have taken the lead in hiding the truth 
about output value, hiding the truth about interest and taxes, 
and would rather for a long period of time wear the label of 
being officials of "a county in sore straits," so as to get 
subsidies from the higher authorities. Therefore, in the view of 
some people, officials of "counties in sore straits" have been 
"blue skies"--just judges--and leaders who have thrown off the 
label of "a county in sore straits" have, on the contrary, 
become people "who sell out the county to seek honor." Because 
they want "to dispense rewards or honors according to merit," 
many people falsely report output values, calculate unhatched 
chicken eggs as live chickens that count as peasant income, and 
calculate overstocked rejects in warehouses as the year's output 
value. Afterward they divide up the bonuses and don the hat of 
an official. When personnel changes are made and it is found out 
that the funds available cannot pay the debts, then the 
state-owned enterprise becomes an empty shell. Fake commodities, 
fake receipts, fake diplomas, fake professional titles--fake 
people and fake things can be found everywhere, and the extent 
of a disaster, based on need, is at will magnified or minimized. 
When cheating in this manner, already people's faces do not 
change colar and they are not flustered. A popular rhyme in 
society is: "Honesty is not worth a penny. If you joke and lie 
you will win a prize every year." 
  Misplacement of law-abiding and lawbreaking. In 
their economic activity, some places advocate "a policy of using 
feet and using talk," and go on to promote the slogans "Dare to 
run a red light" and "Dare to hit an edge ball [a table tennis 
term]" and make them experiences to popularize. The illegal 
evasion of taxes is shameful, but now many people think it is 
honorable, to such an extent that the phenomenon of corporate 
tax evasion has become an open secret. For example, signboards 
of false "three kinds of enterprises" are hung out, signboards 
of false "handicapped persons welfare enterprises" are hung out, 
in order to enjoy the benefits of tax reduction or exemption. 
After tax evaders are investigated and prosecuted, there are 
constant intercessions for them. The Qing government once, 
because it had given up its customs control rights to 
foreigners, was reviled by all the people in the country, and 
this was regarded by later generations as a great national 
humiliation. Now, many local officials openly propose that 
smuggling be made the new growing point of the economy. Even 
smuggling under armed protection. Using the armed forces to deal 
with one's own customs for the purpose of having lawbreaking 
foreign businessmen drive right in one's national gatge 
precisely matches the idiom "throwing the door open for a 
thief." If this shameful act is regarded by some people as a 
magnificent feat, then "the gauze cap will be carried away," 
there will be a deep feeling of being wronged, and people will 
think that whatever one does is for the purpose of becoming an 
official and making money. 
  Misplacement of uncorrupt and corrupt. The 
practice of entertaining guests and sending presents, which is 
now in vogue in society, is generally acknowledged as a 
necessary "emotional investment." Sending presents as bribes is 
clearly corrupt behavior, but everybody thinks that if one does 
not pocket the bribe then one is not corrupt; wining and dining 
on a large scale is clearly corrupt behavior, but it is said "if 
one only eats but does not bring, then politics takes command"; 
and receiving sales commissions is clearly corrupt behavior, but 
now it is widely accepted by the common people. If a sales 
commission is for public use, the person receiving it will be 
commended. Therefore, the image of bing completely uncorrupt has 
already changed to that of being inflexible, rigid, and 
conservative; and much corrupt behavior has become examples of 
daring to charge ahead, daring to take risks, and daring to open 
up. 
  Misplacement of righteousness and wickedness. In 
recent years the news media have repeatedly carried reports of 
evildoers committing in broad daylight physical assault, murder, 
rape, and robbery. In addition, in places where there are more 
people, there is more news about evildoers, and the more people 
there are who are armed the more the victims are isolated and 
cut off from help. There are also instances in which a person 
falls into a body of water and a crowd on the bank looks on 
while he drowns without anyone rescuing him. There are other 
instances in which someone who upholds righteousness gets burned 
while pulling someone else out of a fire, and the result is that 
even the one who was rescued washes his hands of the matter. It 
is bitterly disappointing to hear of such instances! Someone who 
sees an injustice and intervenes to help the victim has become 
"stupid," while someone who sees an injustice and runs away has 
become "smart"--what a preposterous misplacement. Now, in many 
places in succession there have been set up award funds for 
taking up the cudgel in a just cause, the purpose of which is to 
bring back the people's sense of righteousness. 
  Misplacement of talent and wealth. "The superior 
man uses his wealth to seek the right path"--this should be a 
reasonable proposition, but now no one pays attention to whether 
one is on the right path or not, and only wealth is sought. One 
cannot see much stress being put on "talent," and "the head 
hanging upside down" has become old news. In economically 
developed regions, children are unwilling to attend school, 
which they leave as soon as possible in order to make money; in 
economically undeveloped regions, children also do not attend 
school and there is a serious problem of educational 
deprivation. An educational "fault line" between the generations 
is silently growing, and the concept of providing education for 
all without discrimination is regarded as outworn. It is 
unimportant whether one has talent or not; if one has wealth one 
has everything, including the ability to buy diplomas signifying 
talent and education. For many years we called loudly for 
respect for talented persons, with little effect, the main 
reason being that we did not have financial backing. 
  Misplacement of self-esteem and self-belittling. 
When a star appears there is no need to use sunlight to see it. 
There are people who feign righteousness for fame, and they go 
to disaster areas to take the victims' money. This is clearly 
behavior that is self-belittling and that forgets one's 
integrity under the temptation of personal gain, but the party 
concerned is inclined to view it as behavior that shows 
self-respect. From ancient times begging has been shameful, but 
now some people see it as a good profession to become rich fast. 
[South] Koreans consider riding in foreign sedans as shameful; 
Chinese consider riding in foreign cars that have been smuggled 
into China as honorable. 
  In the abovementioned phenomena, it is hard to avoid biased 
terms and the suspicion of exaggerating things just to scare 
people. But in flourishing times there is no fear of 
exaggeration. Exaggerating in flourishing times can sober up 
people and make the flourishing times more flourishing.

<F P=106> [Government work report given by Ren Qixing, Vice Chairman </F>
of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional People's Government] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  I. Review of Work in 1993 </H5>
  The past year was one in which the people in our autonomous 
region triumphantly advanced along the path of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Under the leadership of 
the party Central Committee, the State Council and the 
autonomous regional CPC committee, the governments at all levels 
united with and relied on the people of all nationalities in the 
whole region, rallied around the task of developing socialist 
market economy and promoting the program of socialist 
modernization in an overall manner and conscientiously 
implemented the guideline laid down by the 14th National CPC 
Congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They firmly carried out the 
measures worked out by the central authorities in strengthening 
macro-control and regulation, further liberated our thought, 
boldly carried out practice and basically fulfilled the goal set 
by the First Session of the Seventh Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress for 1993. A gratifying situation prevailed in the our 
region, whereby the economy flourished, the reform program was 
deepened, people of all nationalities were united as one, and 
great social progress was made. 
  -- Sustained economic growth was attained, and new 
progress were made in developing industrial and agricultural 
production and increasing local government revenues. The 
gross national product (GNP) in Ningxia for 1993 totalled 9.65 
billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent, of which the primary 
industry grew 5.5 percent, the secondary industry 12.9 percent 
and the tertiary industry 9.5 percent. The per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP) was 1,965 yuan, up 320 yuan over 1992. 
Steady progress was made in rural economy. The total grain 
output reached 2.03 billion kg, marking an increase of 9.3 
percent and hitting a record high. Commendable growth was 
registered in the production of oil-bearing crops, vegetables, 
fruits, meat, poultry, eggs, milk and aquatic products. The 
township enterprises made rapid progress with their total 
business volume rising to 3.05 billion yuan, up 42.8 percent. 
Industrial production expanded rapidly. In despite of serious 
limitations in fields such as railway transportation, the total 
industrial output value in Ningxia exceeded 10 billion yuan and 
reached 12.08 billion yuan. This registered an increase of 13.9 
percent if the factor of inflation was taken into consideration. 
The amount of taxes and profits turned over to the state by 
Industrial enterprises with independent accounting systems in 
the autonomous region amounted to 980 million yuan, an increase 
of 54.7 percent. The rate of production and marketing reached 
97.6 percent, and the overall index of economic efficiency rose 
10 percent over 1992. The local revenues rose to 1.08 billion 
yuan, up 20.3 percent. The banks at all levels had vigorously 
rectified the financial order, and actively supported local 
economic construction. By the end of 1993, the total amount of 
loans reached 12.08 billion yuan, up 22 percent over 1992. 
  -- Investment in fixed assets on the increase, and 
major construction and technical innovations strengthened. 
  The total investments in fixed assets in the autonomous 
region valued at 5.16 billion yuan, up 35.5 percent, hitting a 
record high in history since the beginning of the reform and 
opening up program. New strides were made in developing major 
construction projects. The northern end of the Baoji-Zhongwei 
Railway under construction had passed Guyuan. It was expected to 
open to traffic ahead of time. The double-track Zhongwei-Gantang 
Railway was completed as scheduled, and more than 80 percent of 
the Da-Gu [1129 0657] Railway leading to the Lingwu Mining 
District were completed. The construction of the Yin-Gu [6892 
0657] Highway and the Yinchuan Bridge across the Yellow River 
was close to completion. Major progress was made in rebuilding 
the Yin-Ping [6892 1627] Highway and the Shi-Ying [4258 3602] 
Highway. The first-stage engineering project for the Rujigou 
coal transportation highway which was China's first one in 
Ningxia built with loans had been completed. Great strides were 
made in developing the earlier stage of the Hedong Airport 
project in Yinchuan, and preparations were made to start 
construction work in the near future. The numbers one to eight 
pumping stations for the Yanhuanding pumping engineering project 
and the main water channels were basically completed, and some 
of the pumping stations had already gone into operation. Rapid 
progress was made in posts and telecommunications. The number of 
new telephone exchanges reached 32,000, and telephones were 
installed in 2 percent of the families in the autonomous region, 
which was close to the average national level. Investments for 
industrial renovations rose to 1.12 billion yuan, an increase of 
40.2 percent. A number of key technical transformation projects 
such as the Yinchuan Chemical Fertilizer Plant, the Ningxia Iron 
Alloy Plant and the Ningxia Coking Plant were successfully 
completed. In 1993, 15 local key technical renovation projects 
and 67 new products passed screening and testing by the relevant 
authorities. 
  -- New strides were made for various reform programs 
and Ningxia opened wider to the outside world. New progress 
was made in building socialist market economy in all aspects. 
The "Regulations on Changing the Way State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises Operate" was further implemented. The reform of the 
system on enterprises' property rights had begun. Ningxia had 
approved 64 shareholding enterprises to open their doors for 
business, and helped the first company to float its stock on the 
market. A total of 259 township enterprises promoted the 
shareholding system; 50 percent of the state-owned commercial 
enterprises instituted the system of letting civilians run state 
enterprises; and 60 percent of the basic-level supply and 
marketing cooperatives were also run by civilians. Prices for 
grain, cooking oil, cement and rolled steel were decontrolled, 
and those of railway transportation, coal, electricity and 
finished oil products were adjusted. New strides were made in 
reforming the wage system and the system of social security, and 
new achievements scored in foreign trade and economic relations. 
The total value of exports was US$110 million, of which exports 
from the local economic sector amounted to US$74.71 million, an 
increase of 11.6 percent. Varieties of export products were more 
than 40 types, and more foreign funds were put to use in the 
autonomous regions. In 1993, foreign investments totalling 
US$36.66 million were in actual use, up 2.6 times. The 
autonomous region had approved 181 new Chinese-foreign joint 
ventures, cooperative and foreign-funded enterprises with the 
total number of such enterprises reaching 286. Funds from 
foreign investors totaled US$11.9 million, an increase of 2.4 
times. 
  -- Progress made by all types of social undertakings 
and socialist culture and ethics advanced. We continued to 
implement the strategy of "rejuvenating Ningxia by relying on 
science and technology," and made our work in science and 
technology cater to the needs of the market and to economic 
construction. In 1993, achievements were scored in the field of 
science and technology, and new progress was made in the 
popularization and application of technologies. The strategic 
role of education was given full play. Fairly significant 
developments were made in basic education and other fields of 
education. Remarkable results were attained in preventing 
students from dropping out, soliciting donations for education 
and solving the problem of owing teachers back pays. There were 
achievements in the development of the "231 project," stage by 
stage. Less than 15 percent of the young people in the 
autonomous regions were illiterate, and the quality of the rural 
laborers was improved. New progress was made in culture, arts, 
the press and publishing, radio, film, television, public 
health, sports, social, and scientific research. A batch of 
excellent creative works which reflected the features of our age 
and our national characteristics were published. Mass cultural 
and sports activities were extensively carried out, enriching 
the people's cultural life. Conditions for urban and rural 
medical care, as well as public health, were much improved, and 
standards in the prevention and treatment of diseases had been 
constantly improved. Facilities for civil administration and 
public welfare services were further upgraded. New developments 
were made in helping the disabled. Good results were attained in 
controlling the population and carrying out the work of planned 
parenthood. The child birth rate and the natural rate of growth 
were 19.43 percent and 14.07 percent respectively, 0.68 percent 
lower than both figures in 1992. Work on environmental 
protection, planning for urban and rural construction, 
prevention of natural disasters, and damage reduction from such 
disasters were further strengthened. 
  We persistently developed the "two types of civilizations"; 
studied hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theories on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and further popularized 
the reform and opening-up policy. We had vigorously promoted 
education on patriotism, collectivism and socialism and on 
professional and social ethics; and extensively developed 
activities to have model communities and units established by 
the army, the police and the people, so as to achieve cultural 
progress. As a result, the people had greatly enhanced their 
sense on cultural progress. We had earnestly implemented the 
"Law on National Regional Autonomy" and the party's policy on 
nationalities. Various activities to strengthen unity among all 
nationalities were vigorously carried out, and a group of 
advanced collectives and individuals emerged. Under the correct 
leadership of the central authorities, the local party 
committees, governments and armed police units in various 
localities had joined their efforts in properly handling the 
case of fighting in Xiji, safeguarded the legal system, abd 
protected the people's interests. We had persistently maintained 
all facets of public security; and waged a firm struggle to 
severely strike at all criminal offenders, guard against theft, 
wipe out pornography, "eliminate the six evil." We had insured 
social stability, and scored achievements in fighting 
corruptions. 
  -- Rural and urban markets flourished, people's 
livelihood continued to improve. The value of retail sales 
in the autonomous region reached 4.3 billion yuan, an increase 
of 15.4 percent. There was an abundant supply of goods on the 
market. Commodity circulation channels were expanded, and 
various ownership systems vied with each other for development. 
The annual per capita income for urban residents used as living 
expenses was 1,907 yuan, up 304 yuan over 1992. The per capita 
net income of a peasant was 667 yuan, an increase of 48 yuan 
over 1992. The savings deposits of urban and rural residents 
totaled 6.14 billion yuan, up 22 percent over the previous year. 
We had quickened the pace in developing urban and rural 
construction and expanded public utility facilities. The living 
conditions of urban and rural residents were further improved, 
and more jobs were available on the market. Some 26,600 people 
were offered jobs in urban areas. The rate of unemployment was 
somewhat lowered. 
  Fellow deputies! Ningxia's achievements in carrying out the 
reform program, opening to the outside world and promoting 
economic and social development in the past year were attained 
by working hard to overcome all kinds of contradictions and 
difficulties. The people of all nationalities on all fronts and 
in all fields in Ningxia had made strenuous efforts and 
courageously fought many battles in order to achieve all this. 
It was not an easy task. Here, on behalf of the autonomous 
regional people's government, I wish to express my sincere 
appreciation to the large number of workers in all fields, 
peasants and intellectuals, to the deputies of the autonomous 
regional people's congress and regional CPPCC members and 
various democratic parties who helped and supervised the 
government in doing its work, to the mass organizations and 
people of all walks of life, to the various units of the central 
authorities stationed in Ningxia that supported us in carrying 
out reform and promoting the economic development, to the 
officers and men of the PLA and armed police units stationed in 
the autonomous region, and to those comrades and friends who 
supported Ningxia in rejuvenating and developing itself. 
  In the course of carrying out reform and promoting 
developments, we must soberly realize the existing 
contradictions and difficulties and understand that there are 
still some problems in doing our work in Ningxia. There remain 
some "bottlenecks" effects that are hampering our economic 
development such as shortage in railway transportation, 
insufficient funds, relatively weak foundation in agriculture 
and lack of vitality. The management of some enterprises is poor 
and they are suffering serious economic losses. Some local 
expenditures are increasing in each passing day. The commodity 
price is rising on a large scale. The government is still 
exploring ways to regulate the economy under the conditions of 
market economy. There are problems in the deeper levels that we 
have to solve in our economic life and operational mechanism. 
There are signs of corruption, bureaucracy and formalism among 
some government functionaries. Some unhealthy practices in 
certain professions are damaging the image of the party and the 
government, and undermining their close relations with the 
people. In doing our work in the future, we must pay full 
attention to these problems, and rely on all the people and all 
sectors of the society to give us full support to solve them as 
soon as possible. 
<H5>  II. Develop the National Economy in a Sustained, Rapid and </H5>
Healthy Manner 
  The central authorities emphatically pointed out that to 
seize the opportunities, deepen reform, open wider to the 
outside world, promote developments and maintain stability is 
the major task of the whole party and the whole nation in doing 
their work. This is also the basic principle in carrying out our 
work well in Ningxia. During the new year, the governments at 
various levels must attach great importance to and correctly 
handle the relations between reform, development and stability. 
The reform is the motivating force, development is the target, 
and stability is the prerequisite. Without a stable social 
environment, nothing can be achieved. In minority areas, we must 
fully understand and earnestly implement the party's policy on 
nationalities and religion, and unite with people of all 
nationalities. This is something of great significance in 
achieving stability. Meanwhile, we must also realize that reform 
and development are the foundation for achieving stability. If 
we do not exert strenuous efforts in carrying out reform, and 
quicken our pace in promoting developments, it will be hard to 
move forward in economic construction and maintain stability 
over a protracted period of time. Right now, we must pay 
attention to tackling some hot issues which affect stability. We 
must strive to make reform, development and stability coordinate 
and promote each other, and simultaneously promote material 
civilization and spiritual civilization. 
  On the basis of the aforementioned basic principle, our 
guideline in carrying out government work in Ningxia for 1994 is 
to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory in building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as a guidance; firmly implement the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th National CPC 
Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress; further emancipate our minds; carry out the reform 
program in an overall manner; open wider to the outside world; 
work hard to readjust the structure; raise economic efficiency; 
firmly establish the basic framework in building the socialist 
market economy; promote the regional economy in a sustained, 
rapid and healthy way; and maintain social stability while 
making overall progress. 
  The main targets for promoting Ningxia's economic and social 
development in 1994 are as follows: 
  -- The GDP in Ningxia should reach 11.4 billion yuan in 
1994, 
an increase of 9 percent over 1993, of which the primary 
industry should grow 4 percent (6 percent in the total 
agricultural output value); the secondary industry 9 percent (10 
percent in the total industrial output value); and the tertiary 
industry 13 percent. 
  -- The local investments in fixed assets should reach 4.44 
billion yuan, up 9.4 percent, of which investments from local 
state-run units on capital construction should amount to 1.38 
billion yuan and investments for technical renovations 750 
million yuan. 
  -- The local revenues after the implementation of the system 
of dividing taxes should reach 602 million yuan, an increase of 
9.8 percent when calculation is made in terms of comparable 
items. 
  -- The total value of imports and exports should reach 
US$175 
million and we should strive to achieve the goal of US$190 
million, and expect to introduce US$35.5 million foreign capital 
into the autonomous region. 
  -- The value of retail sales in Ningxia should reach 4.9 
billion yuan, up 14 percent. 
  -- The general level of retail sales in Ningxia should be 
controlled around 10 percent. 
  -- The proportion of births to population should be kept 
below 19.41 per thousand and the natural rate of population 
growth 14.48 per thousand. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  IV. Further Improve Government Work </H5>
  This year, the governments at various levels will face an 
extremely arduous task in reforming and developing themselves. 
Only by accelerating the change of the operating mechanism of 
state enterprises, keeping government employees honest and 
industrious, and helping them improve their work style and raise 
their work efficiency, will it be possible for them to keep pace 
with the new situation and carry out their tasks on a solid 
bases. 
  -- Accelerate the change of government functions 
To reform the structure of government institutions and change 
their functions is a necessary requirement in building socialist 
market economy and accelerating economic development. Right now, 
our major problems are overstaffing, lax discipline and low work 
efficiency. The governments at various levels must change their 
functions by separating the functions of government from those 
of enterprises and closely following the principle of achieving 
simplification, uniformity and efficiency, reduce the 
bureaucracy, strictly enforce party discipline and increase work 
efficiency. We must make use of the reform program to gradually 
separate the functions of the government from those of the state 
property owners in carrying out social and economic control; 
separate the functions of the government from those of the 
enterprises in handling administrative work; and establish a 
flexible and highly efficient administrative system which meets 
the requirements in building socialist market economy. We must 
be determined to eliminate some special economic departments and 
organizations with overlapping functions, reduce a number of 
temporary, ad hoc establishments, and strengthen those 
departments charged with macro-economic control and supervision 
as well as those responsible for the management of social 
affairs. 
  The reform of government institutions in the autonomous 
region will start this year in an overall manner. The autonomous 
region will carry out this structural reform alternately with 
various prefectures, cities, counties, and townships. Such 
reform will be basically completed during the first half of the 
next year, while the reform at the autonomous regional level 
should be basically completed within this year. The reform of 
the institutions at the prefectural level must be accompanied by 
a redrawing of administrative areas and the improvement of the 
administrative system. The reform at the county level must be 
accompanied by the strengthening of the grassroots political 
power and the expansion of the network of collectivized services 
in rural areas. In carrying out structural reform, we must help 
various departments clearly define their functions and sizes, 
introduce the responsibility system for departments at various 
level and their employees, and combine the streamlining of 
government institutions with rationizing the composition of 
their staff and improving the quality of staff members. We must 
make proper job arrangements for the displaced staff members, 
and implement the system of civil service after the completion 
of the structural reform. 
  Firmly change the work style. In order to 
smoothly fulfill this year's task, the governments and 
departments at various levels must firmly improve their work 
style, raise their professional standards and quality and 
increase their work efficiency. All government employees must 
always keep in mind their aim to wholeheartedly serve the 
people, diligently carry out their duties and perform actual 
deeds for the masses. They must exert strenuous efforts in 
improving services, raising efficiency and carrying out their 
work on a solid ground; and ensure that the various policies of 
the party and the state are resolutely implemented. The leading 
cadres at various levels must vigorously conduct investigation 
and study, maintain close touch with reality, go deep into the 
basic-level units, regard the major issues and difficult 
problems that need to be settled as the main topics in 
conducting their investigation and research, and work out 
realistic countermeasures and solutions. It is necessary to 
establish a system for making democratic and scientific policy 
decisions, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, and do a 
good job in guiding, protecting and fully displaying the 
enthusiasm of the large number of cadres and masses. We must 
persistently seek truth from facts, conscientiously overcome 
bureaucracy and formalism, listen attentively to the views of 
the masses, concern ourselves with the hardship the masses, and 
extricate ourselves from our social appointments and paper work. 
We must talk less but do more; pay attention to major issues; 
handle more difficult tasks; perform more actual deeds; and 
carry out our work in a down-to-earth manner. We must 
persistently uphold the system of showing results attained by 
government institutions, strengthen administrative discipline 
and ensure the implementation of administrative decrees. 
  Continue to penetratingly develop the struggle against 
corruption. To keep government employees at all levels 
honest and industrious is a necessary requirement and important 
guarantee to building socialist market economy and promoting 
economic development. We must not slacken our efforts even 
slightly. We should earnestly implement the decision of the 
central authorities in waging the anti-corruption struggle. 
Leading cadres, particularly cadres at and above the county and 
department levels, must take the lead in performing their duties 
honestly, and become models in observing law and discipline, and 
work selflessly for public interests. We must resolutely punish 
the handful of government employees who have degenerated. In 
handling major and important cases involving leading cadres, we 
must do away with all interferences and prosecute the offenders 
according to law. We must continue to handle special 
prosecutions and combat unhealthy trends. We should further 
strengthen the system of keeping the government clean and 
honest, improve supervision by public opinion, by the society 
and by the supervisory organs. We must strive to use legal and 
administrative means to prevent corruption practices from 
emerging and spreading. Government employees at all levels must 
remain clean and honest and exercise self-discipline, and 
dedicate themselves to serving the people. We must promote 
frugality and practice economy, and wage arduous struggles to 
oppose extravagance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Liaoning Provincial Social Sciences Academy, </F>
Economic Research Institute Director Li Xiangping (2621 0686 
1627): "Liaoning and Economic Cooperation in Northeast Asia: 
Opportunities and Policy Recommendations"] 
  [Text] Today, the world economy is undergoing readjustments 
and regionalization of the international economy is beginning to 
take shape; in Northeast Asia, international cooperation, though 
starting later than elsewhere, is beginning to accelerate. This 
is particularly so in Japan which, in trying to reduce the 
economic burden of slow growth in some sectors of the country's 
main economic axis (a zone of heavy concentration of industries 
linking nine urban centers such as Tokyo, Kobe and Osaka), is 
urgently seeking international cooperation with countries 
contiguous to the Japan Sea to develop a second axis in the area 
north of Kyoto and the coastal area along the Japan Sea. 
Concerned local governments in Japan are making new plans for 
industries in this area by constructing basic infrastructure 
facilities, establishing free ports and taking a series of 
initiatives to engage neighboring countries in direct 
discussions over cooperation in relevant areas. Japan's actions 
fall right in step with developmental needs of other Northeast 
Asian countries. Both the Republic of Korea, which seeks to 
develop the area bordering the Tonghae (Korean name for the 
Japan Sea) and to speed up the changing and upgrading of its 
industrial structure, and Russia, which desires to develop the 
rich natural resources of its Far East region, need access to 
markets and new production facilities of neighboring areas in 
Northeast Asia. Analysis suggests that from the 1980s to the 
early part of the next century, China's development has seen 
three stages of growth, beginning in the south and moving 
northward, which will in term spur economic development in the 
country as a whole. The first growth stage started with 
Guangdong which, relying on its special geographic relationship 
with Hong Kong, formed and built up the south China economic 
zone, and achieved the benefits of reform, opening up and 
development not shared by other provinces, setting in motion the 
waves of industrial revolution during the 10 years of reform in 
China. From the 1990s onward, the Central Government has begun 
to favor the Shanghai-Pudong area, granting favorable conditions 
for its economic renewal, restructuring and development, 
enabling Shanghai to use its substantial economic strength and 
position to help the country's internal and external 
developments, and using this the second stage of growth to spur 
continued development of the national economy. By the beginning 
of the new century, the central government will turn its 
attention to areas bordering the Bohai Sea and the old 
industrial base such as Liaoning and elsewhere; at that time, 
Liaoning can look forward to relying on international 
cooperation in Northeast Asia to complete its substantive 
renewal, and benefiting from the third stage of growth which 
will bring China to becoming a mid-grade developed country. 
  Summarizing the above, it can be said that the Northeast 
Asia 
economic area is based on developmental needs of the area and 
relevant countries themselves, and the combined economic 
benefits to all can sweep away any noneconomic obstacles and 
open up a new era in the Northeast Asian economic area. 
  Within the Northeast Asia economic area, Liaoning is 
situated 
at the hub of both the transportation network and the 
circulation of goods. Viewed in terms of transportation, the 
main channel linking the coastal areas of Northeast Asia and 
China's interior is the rail trunk line of 
Fugang-Dalien-Shenyang-Jiningxian-Russia's Siberia; another fast 
and convenient channel conceivably available at some future 
point runs from Japan through an undersea tunnel to Pusan, on 
to Seoul, Pyongyang, Shenyang and points north. Other channels, 
such as the Xinxie-Tumen-Manzhouli-Chita line which, limited by 
the present small quantities of goods circulated, is not likely 
to become a main trunk line linking sea-land transportation in 
Northeast Asia within this century. Transportation routes often 
lead to economic development. Liaoning, using its advantageous 
position in the transportation network, can look forward to 
becoming an important wing in the main axis of the Northeast 
Asia economic area. In terms of division of labor and 
circulation of goods, although Liaoning's level of development 
is lower than that of comparable areas in Japan and South Korea, 
Liaoning is not substantially behind in terms of its industrial 
stage of development. The area north of Japan's Kyoto and along 
the Sea of Japan coast was the base of Japan's traditional 
industries including the heavy chemical industries, and not 
Japan's [modern] industrially developed area, and the difference 
vis-a-vis Liaoning is not as great as people may imagine. 
Therefore, Liaoning, South Korea and Japan's coastal areas are 
comparable and together constitute the developed and relatively 
developed areas of the Northeast Asia region. From the central 
part of Liaoning, north and westward to Russia's Far East 
hinterland, to eastern Mongolia, Northeast Inner Mongolia and to 
northern Jiangxi and Fujian, this is a large area making up the 
hinterland of the NE Asia economic area which is next to be 
developed. Because Liaoning's middle-grade technology can link 
up with economies of the above-mentioned developed and 
developing areas, Liaoning stands to gain given its advantageous 
position as these areas begin to open up to the outside world. 
Unquestionably, the day when this possibility is realized will 
be the time that Liaoning's old industrial base will be 
revitalized. 
  Therefore, Liaoning should look ahead to the future and, to 
carry out concrete initiatives to promote the Northeast Asia 
economic area, consider adopting new policies in the following 
areas: 
  First, determine a positive international market strategy, 
and direct the policy of opening toward the Northeast Asia 
region. This is not to suggest that we change the basic policy 
of opening to the outside, but following the principle of 
gaining benefits for both sides, we should select markets with 
the most potentials and gradually develop a stable international 
division of labor by adjusting the enterprise structure on a 
reciprocally beneficial basis. In moving toward this direction, 
we should carry out suitable preferential policies to promote 
and advance cooperation. 
  Second, base the policy of developing an industrial policy 
to 
promote change and upgrading the industrial structure through 
opening to the outside. With a new structure, we advance to the 
level of the developed zone within the Northeast Asia region. In 
Japan, coastal areas in northern Kyushu are positively promoting 
industrial structural readjustment, seeking to move the 
traditional heavy chemical industries to the China mainland, 
keeping in Japan the advanced, high-tech components of these 
industries and vigorously developing a new high-tech industrial 
strategy. From the standpoint of resources, Liaoning no longer 
has any advantage to develop traditional heavy chemical 
industries, and if more investments were drawn to such 
industries, it will only exacerbate the limitations on 
development of such industries and cause them to be mired in 
even grater difficulties. Liaoning should adopt an industrial 
policy similar to that of Northern Kyushu in Japan, by 
dispersing the first-stage of production of heavy industries and 
moving it to the interior, by vigorously developing the advanced 
and high-tech components of these industries and, at the same 
time, positively developing [other] new high-tech industries. 
Therefore, Liaoning should adopt even more favorable 
preferential policies to attract foreign investment in new 
high-tech industries, strengthen further the coastal area new 
high-tech zones and the building of basic infrastructure 
facilities, and compete with other similar areas in Japan and 
South Korea for investment in new, high-tech industries by 
offering an even more advantageous investment environment. 
  Third, promote policy coordination and direct dialogue with 
various local governments in the Northeast Asia region. Planning 
officials of relevant local governments in Japan have pointed 
out that international cooperation in the region should have the 
special characteristic of direct cooperation between neighboring 
countries in the area, and called upon various local governments 
to enter into direct contact and negotiations for construction 
of infrastructure facilities along the coastal areas. Government 
departments on our side should respond positively to such 
suggestions which create a policy environment conducive to 
cooperation. 
  Fourth, establish a repository of information and reference 
sources on Northeast Asia international cooperation. To begin 
with, we should devote effort to foster cooperation and pooling 
of knowledge capital among the societies in Northeast Asia. It 
is the intellectual and scholarly circles that suggested and 
actively promoted the concept of cooperation in the Northeast 
Asia region. Intellectuals and scholars are the most important 
asset in the information age -- they are society's knowledge 
capital, and will be of pivotal importance in the development of 
the future Northeast Asia economic area. To meet today's demands 
against a background of international cooperation in Northeast 
Asia, we should also promote scholarly exchanges in our own 
area, take greater initiatives to support scholars and 
intellectuals in building information and reference repositories 
to strengthen the atmosphere for international cooperation in 
Northeast Asia, stimulate new thinking on cooperation, and 
provide direct informational and intellectual support to bring 
about such cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by Ho Kang-hua (0149 1660 5478)] </F>
  [Text] Since China initiated reforms and opened up to the 
outside world, she has attracted a large volume of foreign 
investment. This has had a great effect on China in the way she 
has changed. However, official circles are also aware how this 
foreign capital, in a covert way, is changing the face of 
Chinese society. It can be said that the feeling in official 
circles toward foreign business is a mixed one of love and hate, 
much like lovers who do not know when they will have another 
quarrel. 
  Recently, the Ministry of International Trade and Economics 
of the State Council conducted a large scale survey focusing on 
some of the solely foreign-funded enterprises in Dalian, 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen to further understand the influence 
of such businesses after their appearance in China. The results 
show several problems that warrant attention. 
<H5>  Negotiated Foreign Funding in Tens of Billions (U.S. Dollars) </H5>
  Up to the end of September 1933, about 10,000 solely 
foreign-funded enterprises had been approved, for a total 
investment close to US$20 billion U.S. They comprised 16 percent 
of the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises, and 25.3 
percent of the total foreign capital investment agreed upon. The 
rapid rise and development of solely foreign-funded enterprises 
took place after 1988. From the beginning of 1988 to September 
1993, 10,000 of solely foreign-funded enterprises had been 
approved, with an agreed upon investment totalling more than $20 
billion (actual amount invested was $3 billion), comprising 98 
percent and 92 percent respectively, of the aforementioned 
totals. At present, enterprises already established and started 
on production, and those in process of construction make up more 
than two-thirds of the solely foreign-funded enterprises 
approved. These enterprises are located mostly in special 
economic zones and opened coastal ports. For example, in the 
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, approval had been granted to 
about 1,500 solely foreign-funded enterprises by the end of 
September 1993. These enterprises were engaged primarily in 
electronics manufacture, mechanical processing, industrial 
chemicals, light industry, construction materials, textiles and 
clothing, real estate etc. Investors were primarily from Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, the United States and Germany. 
<H5>  Rapid Growth on a Large Scale </H5>
  In studying the tendencies of these solely foreign-funded 
enterprises, official circles discovered that since 1988, 
development of these enterprises exhibit two outstanding 
characteristics: 
  1) The speed of growth and the continually increasing scope 
of capital investment. 
  In 1988, only 410 solely foreign-funded enterprises were 
approved for all of China, with an agreed upon capital 
investment totalling $480 million U.S. By 1989, this figure had 
increased to 931 enterprises, with an agreed upon capital 
investment totaling $1.654 billion; by 1990, to 1,860 
enterprises with investment totaling $2.444 billion; by 1991, to 
2,793 enterprises with investment totalling $3.667 billion; by 
1992, to 3,607 enterprises with investment totalling $5.210 
billion; and by 1993, to 4,100 enterprises with the investment 
total in excess of $6 billion. 
  2) Increases in project size and in volume of capital 
investment from Taiwan. 
  Solely foreign-funded enterprises everywhere usually start 
on a small scale. In the beginning, they were usually small and 
of an exploratory nature, but grew as time went on. Take the 
situation in Dalian as an example. Before 1986, capital 
investment in a solely foreign-funded enterprise averaged 
$1,458,800. Since 1988, the average capital investment had been 
on the rise--up to $1,573,800 for that year. By 1993, the 
average capital investment had increased to $3.5 million. 
<H5>  Increases in Taiwan Investment and in Large Scale Projects </H5>
  In recent years, following continued improvement in the 
investment environment, the number of solely foreign-funded 
enterprises has been on the rise. At present, of such 
enterprises with a capital investment in excess of $10 million, 
25 are located in Xiamen, nine in Zhuhai, and six in Shenzhen. 
In Dalian, there is only the "Jieneng Dalian Office Equipment 
Co., Ltd.," a solely Japanese-owned enterprise in which more 
than $100 million has been invested. 
  The growth of solely foreign-funded enterprises owned by 
Taiwan business is most marked along the coast of Fujian 
Province. For example, among the 840 solely foreign-funded 
enterprises located in the city of Xiamen, 625 are owned by 
Taiwan business. Among 756 already approved enterprises funded 
by Taiwan investors, 76 percent of them are sole-proprietor 
enterprises owned by Taiwan business. 
  However, we cannot have it both ways. At the same time that 
foreign investment benefits China in many ways, it is also 
accompanied by many problems, of which the following two are 
quite serious. 
  1) Serious tax evasion accompanying outstanding economic 
benefits. 
  Solely foreign-funded enterprises usually adopt up-to-date 
techniques and equipment. Enterprise management is strict, and 
their products are strongly competitive on the international 
market, while reaping good economic benefits and great profit. 
According to followup analysis by the Xiamen Committee on 
Foreign Investment of economic benefits received by some 
important enterprises among 680 solely foreign-funded 
enterprises that are in production, 94.1 percent are making a 
profit, while only 79 percent of joint venture enterprises are 
doing the same. Statistics compiled by the Zhuhai Committee on 
Economics and Trade for 1991 also showed that among 210 solely 
foreign-funded enterprises already engaged in production, 173 
were making profits that totalled more than 100 million yuan. 
The 88 enterprises that did not show a profit incurred losses 
totalling 52 million yuan, 54.7 percentage points of the deficit 
covered. However, among the 530 solely foreign-funded 
enterprises (including those already in production) granted 
approval, close to 200 of them had their investment capital 
increased in recent years to more than 200 million yuan, which 
comprised 32 percent of the agreed upon quota. 
  How the solely foreign-funded enterprises frequently use a 
high-cost import and low-priced export technique to transfer 
their profits out of China, or use a branch company to do so is 
reflected wherever these enterprises operate. This is done to 
achieve their goal of paying as little tax as possible. 
According to statistics compiled by the port of Xiamen, the 
value of output from solely foreign-funded enterprises in Xiamen 
for 1992 was 41.2 percent of that from all foreign ventures in 
Xiamen, but the enterprise income tax from the solely foreign 
funded operations was only 11.4 percent of that paid by all 
foreign ventures. 
  2) Tense internal labor-management relationships. 
  Because solely foreign-funded enterprises do not have a 
middleman, and the "Law on Foreign Ventures" does not clearly 
define such a management slot for these enterprises, 
labor-management relationships within such enterprises are not 
easy to handle. Moreover, certain solely foreign-funded 
enterprises, especially owners of smaller operations at certain 
ports, will cut costs wherever possible, in pursuit of maximum 
profit. To do so, they will prolong normal working hours at 
will, and overlook improvement of working conditions on one 
hand, and on the other, adopt an arbitrary parental approach 
that uses physical punishment, bag and body searches, so that 
the conflicting relationship between workers not used to such 
treatment and the enterprise owner worsens, leading to work 
strikes and resistance. This phenomenon has been noted in places 
such as Dalian, Zhuhai and Xiamen. Take Xiamen for example. More 
than 30 strikes have taken place during the last few years, the 
largest strikes being one where more than 700 workers 
collectively "walked off" for one day, and another where 250 
workers stayed off work for 3 days. 
  Because solely foreign-funded enterprises are expanding so 
fast and coming on so strong, and China has yet to have a 
corresponding policy, regulations and supervisory mechanism to 
keep up with them, such enterprises have urgent management 
problems that need to be resolved. They are: 
  1) The state's lack of measures to implement effective tax 
oversight on profits of solely foreign-funded enterprises. At 
present, some of these enterprises have yet to seriously 
implement an independent accounting system, as they regard their 
enterprises only as subsidiaries of foreign companies, through 
which they can avoid inspection and oversight by taxing 
agencies. Even as some of them have yet to set up a strict 
finance accounting system, they have not set up independent 
financial records either, or they may keep several sets of books 
instead. The accounts between quite a number of enterprises and 
their parent companies are often unclear, for they regularly use 
the "high-cost import" and "low-price export" technique to 
transfer their profits to avoid taxes. 
  2) Clarification of rules and regulations dealing with 
foreign ventures. This problem was noted from evaluation of 
solely foreign-funded enterprises, one of considerate concern to 
all local agencies of economics and foreign trade. Even as the 
"Regulations on Implementing the Law on Foreign Ventures" have 
been announced, some problems still remain to be clarified, 
making it difficult for those responsible for granting approval 
to make a decision. For example, with respect to an item of sole 
ownership involving plant and facility construction that does 
not require a petition for land use, does it still require the 
planning committee to establish an item? Does an enterprise 
funded solely by an individual need to establish a board of 
trustees, and if so, how shall it go about it? What about the 
legal basis for changes, dissolution, exchanges between 
shareholders, and share classification? What about the legal 
basis for the way capital is invested in a solely foreign-funded 
enterprise, time limits on capital payments, termination 
conditions etc.? 
  3) Important management problems. This includes inadequate 
capital payments into a solely foreign-funded enterprise, 
striking a proper ratio between production and marketing as 
determined, resolving long-time resistant deadlocks, setting up 
a legal person as an enterprise item, unwillingness to provide 
statistical reports etc. People on the Chinese mainland do not 
know how to deal with such problems. 
  4) Other problems. Most important is the pressure for 
medical care, housing, family planning, public safety and other 
services needed by the large labor force imported from outside 
the immediate area to work in solely foreign-funded enterprises. 
Once these enterprise operations have been fulfilled or 
completed ahead of time, these workers become surplus baggage. 
As many of these enterprises are labor-intensive operations, 
their expansion frequently leads to fighting with local 
enterprises for water, electricity, materials, markets etc. By 
taking away space that could be used for development of a new 
hi-tech industry, they hinder development and progress for the 
local industry as a whole. Furthermore, how to make timely duty 
refunds on indirect export of products from these enterprises, 
in accordance with related regulations (such a problem with duty 
refunds occurred in Xiamen where several solely foreign-funded 
enterprises owned by Taiwan business made a joint petition), how 
to resolve the labor management problems that frequently occur, 
ands how to protect the enterprise workers' welfare and other 
legal benefits are all very knotty problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Cai Yan (5591 6056) titled: "Looking at the </F>
Budget, Talking About Government Bonds"] 
  [Text] This year's budget report contains something that 
has attracted people's attention, and this is the fact that in 
1994 total debt will reach 129.245 billion yuan. In a country 
like China, with a marked contradictions between the supply of 
and demand for funds, this debt figure is a strong indication of 
the difficult situation faced by central financial organs. 
  Just how is this debt figure of 129.245 billion yuan 
calculated? The report reflects the three major parts to the 
calculation: first, a total of 66.919 billion yuan through the 
issuance of domestic bonds to meet normal financial revenue and 
expenditure difference; second, 48.081 billion yuan in bonds to 
repay this year's matured debts plus interest; third, there is 
the state's foreign borrowing of money, amounting to 14.245 
billion yuan, used for national key construction projects. In 
short, there is the need to make up for the deficit, and 
borrowing new debt to service old debt and adding in key 
construction projects. 
  One major change in the debt plan is that from this year on, 
the financial deficit will not again be made up through the 
expedient of overdrawing on the central bank, but will be solved 
through the issuance of government debt instruments. This, from 
an objective point of view, will enable China to even more 
clearly determine the economic situation and financial 
conditions. Because under conditions that the government is 
financially overdrawn, if the bank does not tighten lending, the 
overdrawn condition will surely lead to the issuance of more 
currency, due to the fact that there is no corresponding 
guarantee of commodities and labor services, the result will 
inevitably be an increase in inflation. For this reason, the 
change described above will be beneficial for macroeconomic 
regulation and mitigating inflationary pressures. 
  The issuance of state bonds to raise funds has always been a 
major method for governments to regulate the economy. In the 13 
years since 1981 that China has returned to the issuance of debt 
obligations, government issuance of bonds has had an active 
effect on the raising of construction capital and on the 
development of a government debt instrument market. In 
particular, after 1988 attention has been given to using market 
methods (such as the establishment of a state bond trading 
market, and buying and selling of contracts), and after the 
launching of state bonds, there has been a great change in the 
government debt situation, though after the second half of 1992, 
due to market changes there has been no choice but to return to 
administrative measures to promote sales of government debt 
instruments. What has made people think hard was why 
administrative measures did not work and market methods have a 
difficult time stabilizing the market? The key lies in reform 
of the government debt market, which has not really been 
established on the basis of a socialist market economy, and in 
addition, there has been no corresponding reforms and policies. 
For this reason reform in government debt issuance should be 
linked with the development and improvement of the financial 
markets, to make state bonds become the major linking point 
between fiscal policy and monetary policy, through the 
implementation of state bond mortgage and discount policies to 
push financial organs to hold a certain proportion of government 
debt, and make government debt into a major method for the 
central bank to take in and put out currency and strengthen 
monetary management. 
  From the budget report, we can look at the debt, and 
consider 
the reality of the year by year expansion of the financial 
deficit, and note that the national debt is also progressively 
expanding. If state finances progressively increase their 
reliance on the issuance of bonds, this is bound to 
progressively add to the interest burden, and have an adverse 
effect on the improvement of the financial situation. For this 
reason, as commenting on the debt, people place hope on reform 
of the financial and tax systems, and this is a major factor for 
reform and development, and is also a basic condition for 
fundamentally improving financial conditions.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 2535): "Reform of the Exchange </F>
Rate System Moves into High Gear"] 
  [Text] Starting on 1 April, taking as a symbol of the 
forward operation of the nationwide unified interbank foreign 
exchange market and comprehensive implementation of a bank 
foreign exchange conversion and foreign exchange selling system, 
China's foreign exchange management system reform will push 
forward on the basis of the three month transition period of 
earlier this year. This series of undertakings has already 
attracted broad attention from media circles at home and abroad. 
On 30 March, the State Foreign Current Management Office, Policy 
Regulations Department Department Chief Yang Gonglin agreed to 
an interview by this reporter. Department Chief Yang provided a 
detailed and authoritative elaboration of matters of concern to 
readers. 
<H5>  The transition period of reform is going smoothly, the RMB </H5>
exchange rate is basically stable 
  Since the start of reform of the foreign exchange system, 
the 
originally specified program called for a transition period of 
January to March, the reason being that the pace of reform was 
quite substantial, which contained much substance, and some 
measures had to be implemented in succession up to April 1. 
Looking at the situation at present, during these three months, 
China's foreign exchange management system reform has seen the 
transition from the old to the new system. 
  First, a smooth change has been brought about from dual 
exchange rates to a single exchange rate, and the basic 
stability of the exchange rate has been maintained. 
  Second, the turnover of foreign exchange to higher 
authorities and the retention of a portion of foreign exchange 
have been eliminated, and a bank foreign exchange conversion 
system has been implemented, increasing the amounts of foreign 
exchange on hand. Foreign currency on hand at the end of last 
year was $21.1 billion, which at present it has reached more 
than $27 billion. It should be stressed that this is mainly due 
not to an increase in export generated foreign exchange, but 
reflects changes in foreign exchange allocation mechanisms. 
Following the elimination of the turning over of foreign 
exchange to higher authorities and the retaining of foreign 
currency, enterprises were happy to go to the bank for foreign 
exchange conversion, and have also taken foreign currency 
retained abroad and returned it for conversion. In addition, in 
the non-trade area, after the issuing of foreign exchange 
certificates (FEC) ceased, there was direct formation of foreign 
exchange income, and there was some foreign exchange income 
earned last year year has been recalled for conversion this 
year. Due to these factors, the overall increase in foreign 
exchange income can be explained by the smooth progress of this 
reform. But we also cannot be blindly optimistic, there is also 
a need to increase export generated foreign exchange. During the 
transition period, the People's Bank has adopted a number of 
measures to ensure that enterprises that are importing can use 
foreign currency. 
  Third, after the issuing of FECs ceased, the reclaiming of 
FECs has gone smoothly, and up to the end of February, close to 
1 billion yuan worth of FEC had been reclaimed, though several 
hundreds of millions remain in circulation. 
  Fourth, the interbank foreign exchange market has been 
prepared, and already, in the five cities of Beijing, Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Hangzhou and Shenzhen a linked network has been 
achieved, and starting from 1 March, foreign exchange 
transactions are being conducted transregionally, while the test 
running results have been very good. After 1 April, other cities 
will be linked one by one to the network including Guangzhou, 
Xiamen, Chengdu, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Qingdao, and there will be 
a progressive expansion of the area of coverage. 
  Here I must stress that in some locales people are saying 
that the network has encountered difficulties, and that the 
operation of interbank foreign exchange market will be 
postponed, hence deducing of exchange rates cannot be 
stabilized. This rumor is completely unfounded, and the 
stability of exchange rates is primarily determined by the 
supply and demand relationship of foreign currencies, and bears 
no direct relationship whatever to the network. 
  At the same time, within the transition period, the relevant 
concrete implementation plans were drafted, in order to 
gradually place the reform program implementation on an 
institutional basis. Each bank, in order to enter the unified 
market, also is properly handling the mental and technological 
operational preparation. 
  The reasons for those achievements that have been attained 
within the transition period include: one, this instance of 
reform is a steady deepening of the previous several instances 
of foreign exchange system reform; second, the policy measures 
are reliable, and retain the foreign exchange swap centers for 
supply of foreign currencies, while the central bank makes up 
the difference to ensure that there is not advantage in the 
foreign exchange; third, the transparency level is high, and has 
been understood and supported by all. In the process of reform, 
maintaining stable exchange rates is a very important condition. 
Modern exchange rates are a product of the market, and are 
produced on the basis of a weighted average price of the foreign 
exchange bought and sold throughout the country in the 18 
foreign exchange swap centers, and basically reflects market 
supply and demand relations. At the same time, due to the 
practice of the foreign exchange conversion system, and 
increases in the state's foreign exchange surplus, the ability 
of the state to intervene in the market also increases. 
<H5>  A Unified Foreign Exchange Market Begins To Operate, the </H5>
Price Formation Mechanism is Becoming More Perfected 
  Starting on 1 April, operation of a national unified 
interbank foreign exchange market began, in contrast to the 
situation in the past where scattered enterprises used a 
nonstandard market to conduct foreign exchange transactions 
through swap centers. The past foreign exchange swap centers, 
even though it historically had a major effect, in the end it 
was decentralized, and nonstandard. Under the premise that banks 
convert foreign currency and sell foreign currency as a service 
to enterprises, the banks per se will engender the problem of 
regulation of foreign currency funds. Hence banks must mutually 
buy and sell foreign currencies, and at the same time, 
objectively they can demand that the central bank handle 
intervention in the foreign exchange market. 
  The foreign exchange center established in Shanghai is a 
leap 
into the foreign exchange market. The market will take 
headquarters of all banks involving domestic foreign exchange 
work as its principle focus. At the same time will allow 
foreign capital banks to apply for admission. Considering the 
conditions of China's current stage of development and the 
stipulations in the foreign exchange system reform plan that 
ensure no change in foreign-funded enterprise, foreign exchange 
management, swap centers will still be retained, this will 
primarily be of service to foreign currency regulation among 
foreign-funded enterprises, and assist them in maintaining 
balance. However, the prices of swap centers will be consistent 
with the prices of the unified market, this is an issue which is 
being put into effect. 
  After the formation of a unified market, rational operation 
of foreign currency funds will be promoted, and different 
foreign currency prices engendered by foreign currency supply 
and demand imbalances between regions will be resolved, further 
perfecting the price formation mechanism, and this will be 
beneficial to stabilizing exchange rates. From now on the 
interbank foreign exchange market transaction first day closing 
price will be taken as the primary basis for the central bank 
published second day RMB to US dollar middle rate. 
  Looking at the current supply and demand situation, foreign 
currency supply will be ensured, while foreign currency demand 
will also not suddenly increase. Therefore, foreign exchange 
prices will remain stable at the current levels. 
<H5>  Comprehensive Implementation of Currency Conversion Currency </H5>
Purchasing, Foreign Exchange Quotas Will Not Be Abolished 
  Starting on 1 April, there will be a comprehensive 
implementation of a bank currency conversion, and currency 
purchasing system. However, there will also need to be an 
adjustment period, as the past operation sequence of enterprise 
foreign currency employment has already been completely replaced 
by the new system, and for this reason it is necessary to as 
rapidly as possible become familiar with the new sequence. 
  The enterprise foreign exchange employment examination and 
approval system has basically already been abolished, and 
enterprise foreign exchange employment has become much more 
convenient. At the same time even more pressure is being placed 
on enterprises, and it is necessary to protect against exchange 
rate risks, while the basic stability of the RMB exchange rate 
depends on the concern and safeguarding of enterprises and 
various circles of the society. Enterprises, in the process of 
engaging in international trade, must pay attention to 
forecasting trends in various currencies, and choose a suitable 
currency for settling accounts, while mastering the use of 
financial methods for avoiding and reducing exchange rate risks. 
  At present in the society there are rumors that indicate the 
foreign exchange quota on 1 April must be abolished or people 
will be forced to sell. This is completely without foundation. 
In the past the foreign exchange quotas that enterprises had 
still can be used by at the enterprises' own initiative, and 
there is no issue that became invalid on 1 April. In addition 
there will be no coercion to sell, therefore enterprises can be 
completely at ease, and there is no need to believe all that one 
hears.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Zhenghong (0632 2973 1347) entitled: "The </F>
Goal: An International Capital Market" 
  [Text]Though securities markets are volatile, and fast 
changing, as the years elapse in the end they leave a mark. In 
1993, when the Shanghai securities market developed at its 
fastest pace, the number of stock listing leaped by 2.2 times, 
and the total shares on the market surged some 4.5 times, and 
when it came to companies listed on the market, they went from 
only two earlier in the year and expanded to 36, and there was 
2.8 fold increase in the number of member securities traders, 
while in particular, the market's annual transaction total 
reached a volume of 500 billion yuan, making up half of the 
total volume of Shanghai market transactions. 
  Shanghai's planned development target for this century is to 
again ascend to the position of being one of the country's, and 
even the Far Eastern region's, economic, financial, and trade 
centers. Shanghai's securities transaction market has in a 
period of just over three years, been the first to take the lead 
in tracing out a market domain that extends to the entire 
country. The Shanghai Stock Market has already broken through 
regional barriers, and extended over national borders, 
converging into the systemic circulation of the international 
capital market. 
  More than three years ago, on December 19, 1990, in the 
Shanghai city government's tall gray building, the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange opened for business. This was the new China's 
first Stock Exchange, and from this emerged China's first new 
and developing capital market. 
  What history must tell later generations includes: on that 
day, within the 477 square meter exchange hall, 46 dual broker 
seats, the hall's main wall contained a 4.7 meter long, 2.7 
meter high electronic screen, which immediately displayed the 
transaction situation of 8 stocks and 22 bonds, while the 
transaction center computer network linked up more than 100 
terminals. The first batch of member stock brokers amounted to 
only 25 people, while the first market volume of business 
totalled 10.3 million yuan. 
  Today, looking at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, at this 
location there are 6 transaction halls in use, with 2600 seats, 
and the number of stocks on the market has increased to 119, 
while there are now 481 members. 
  In the space of three years, the Shanghai stock market 
overall volume of business has exploded from 280 million yuan to 
reach 20.1 billion yuan, and the market price total value has 
also gone from 1.3 billion yuan to 250 billion yuan. At the same 
time, the number of securities investors has expanded from 30 
thousand to over 4.6 million people. 
  The volume of trade on the Shanghai Stock Market, from the 
early day totals of 20 million yuan has grown to the present 
greatest volume of business close to 4 billion yuan. According 
to an analysis by experts, this is comparable to the 1992 level 
of the 100-year old "world class" Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This 
means that the "three year old child" Shanghai Stock Exchange is 
comparable to the "one hundred year-old man " Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange, and it's "appetite" is only different by a year's 
level. 
  At present, more than 90 percent of the members of the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange are securities traders from various 
locales throughout the country; more than 70 percent of the 
investors are from provinces and cities outside Shanghai, spread 
over cities and towns and even reaching the border regions; in 
the Shanghai securities market, there are already more than 1100 
securities business sites. The Shanghai Stock Exchange at 
present has already established links with the Fuzhou Securities 
Trading Center and succeeded in operating for 3 months, and also 
plans to complete major links with 10 securities trading centers 
including those in Guangzhou, Haikou, Chengdu, and Shenyang. 
  What this series of numbers represents is the fact that 
there 
is no doubt that Shangai has already started down the road to 
becoming the radiation center for China's securities market. In 
addition, its rapid development has also gotten the attention of 
securities circles in New York, London, and Tokyo, and they are 
saying "this is a fastest new and development capital market in 
history." There are some foreigners in the business who predict 
that between 2010 and 2020, the Shanghai Stock Market will 
become one of the largest stock markets in the world. 
  Since the emergence of Holland's Amsterdam Stock Market in 
1613, in stock trading activity there have been 380 years of 
development in world economic history, and in the three year 
period since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, through 
the use of modern high technology methods, the operational 
methods and market efficiency of the Shanghai securities market 
stand in the front ranks of current world stock markets. At the 
moment, the Shanghai Stock Exchange possesses an electronic 
computer system that handles 1800 transactions per second, and 
securities transactions are comprehensively implemented by 
computer automatic competitive price transactions, while a 
special purpose space satellite and earth laser fiber optic data 
transmission stereo communications network has been established; 
there has been a comprehensive implementation of a no-paper 
system for securities transactions, and an automatic ownership 
transfer system has been implemented, along with same day 
accounts settling, and a central registration accounts closing 
system comparable to international standards has been formed. 
  Taking the emergence two years ago of new China's first RMB 
special stocks on the Shanghai securities market as an 
indication, the Chinese mainland's securities markets in reality 
are already moving towards international capital markets, and 
last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange's B shares listings went 
from 9 to 22, while the market overall volume increased from 800 
million yuan to more than 1.8 billion yuan; in addition, at 
present 50 overseas securities trading house representatives 
have seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and this means for 
foreign circles that the door to China's securities market is 
wide open. Last year, the mainland directly entered overseas 
capital markets with six large enterprises including Qingdao 
Beer, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangdong Boat International, 
Magang Shares, and Kunming Machine Tools, and at the same time 
on the Hong Kong market H shares, their A shares also started to 
trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Media circles will view 
this as the erection of bridges between the Chinese mainland and 
overseas capital markets. 
  As China's first capital market launched during reforn and 
opening, the Shanghai securities market is already having an 
ever greater deepening effect on China's economic activity. Last 
year the Shanghai Stock Exchange ignited the "Baoyan 
Disturbance," following on the heels of this was the "Wanshen 
Incident," which was a precedent for new Chinese enterprises to 
use market methods for transferring property rights. It 
indicated that China's securities market, in the same way as the 
international securities market, is striding towards the 
function of becoming a multifaceted capital market. Stock 
markets not only serve as vehicles for enterprises to raise 
funds, but also provides a concrete method for thousands and 
thousands of investors to directly participate in financial 
investment, and participate in share enterprise management; they 
also serve as a mechanism for enteprises to transform 
management, and better allocate property rights and resources. 
  Shanghai Stock Exchange General Manager Wei Wenyuan [1414 
2429 3220], describes prospects for the development of the stock 
market in Shanghai over the next two or three years as follows: 
acceleration of the process of market internationalization, and 
the attraction of international capital; the promotion of the 
opening of the government bond market to the outside; the 
struggle to have large, well-known foreign corporations list 
stock on the Shanghai market. When it comes to development of 
the bond market, taking government bonds as primary, we need to 
create new types of trading products, and not only have a 
futures buy back business, but also there is a need for having 
option dealing, to supply services for reform of the financial 
system, and coordinate central bank regulation of the currency 
supply. 
  In Shanghai's most glamorous Pudong New Zone, the "Shanghai 
Securities Tower" has invested US$120 million and is each day 
"adding brick, adding tile." In 1995, this 3000 trading seat 
integrated securities services tower will use the world's most 
advanced information handling and transmission system in dealing 
with the market.

<F P=106> [Article by Fei Shuang (7378 7208): "China Active in </F>
International Capital Market--World Credit Market Expanded 
Rapidly Last Year"] 
  [Text] The latest figures, on 27 February, from the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
showed that in 1993 China strengthened its position as a main 
player in the international capital market by giving the 
fast-growing international market a pounding. 
  In 1993 China issued stock with a value of $1.2 billion, a 
quarter of the value of all stocks issued in Asia. Last year the 
value of stocks issued in Asia increased by 250 percent, from 
$1.8 billion in 1992 to $4.5 billion. 
  At the same time, in consortium loans China is the largest 
loan country in Asia, and the value of its total loans has 
increased from $2.7 billion in 1992 to $3.6 billion. China has 
almost a quarter of the value of all bank loans in Asia. In 1993 
its bank loans in Asia grew 30 percent, to $15.4 billion. 
  China is also one of the main players in the bond market; in 
1993 it raised $3 billion by issuing bonds. This made the funds 
raised by China in the abovementioned three ways to toal $7.8 
billion. 
  The OECD also said that in 1993 the amount of loans on the 
world market grew by a third, to a record $811 billion. The 
demand for bond issues in Asia and Latin America caused the 
amount of capital raised on the markets of developing countries 
to reach an unprecedented $84 billion. The OECD added that the 
market activity could still be dynamic in the future. 
  The part of the OECD report on trends in financial markets 
said that the cause of this amazing growth was that the amount 
of loans of OECD countries grew $150 billion, as well as the 
active seeking of loans on the capital market by the dynamic 
Asian countries and the Latin American countries headed by 
Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. 
  The capital raised by OECD countries rose from $536 billion 
in 1992 to $691 billion, accounting for 85 percent of world 
loans, the lowest figure since 1985. Among the main debtor 
countries in the OECD, America and Japan are still in first 
place. A survey showed that the capital raised by America and 
Japan increased respectively from $95 billion and $76 billion in 
1992 to $125 billion and $85 billion. The capital raised by 
Germany almost doubled -- from $28 billion in 1992 to $65 
billion. Next were France, which raised $58 billion; Britain, 
which raised $51 billion; and Canada, which raised $39 billion. 
  The capital raised by the developing countries has almost 
doubled -- from $47.3 billion in 1992 to $84.5 billion. Their 
share of the market has increased from 7.8 percent two years ago 
to 10.4 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 1807), affiliated with the PBC's </F>
Financial Studies Institute: "A Brief Discussion of a Policy 
Bank"] 
  [Text] While academics and industrialists have conducted 
widespread discussions on how to convert specialized banks to 
commercial ones, with all press organs carrying many articles on 
this subject, which of course is an essential one still needing 
further discussion, it seems that relatively speaking, they have 
not paid enough attention to ways of establishing a policy bank. 
So this article is presenting certain views on the matter, as 
food for thought for those studying it. 
<H5>  I. The Necessity of Policy-Related Business </H5>
  Banking policy-related business is specifically the granting 
of low-interest, concessional loans to certain industries and 
enterprises in line with national economic policy. It can be 
said to be an international practice, existing in all countries 
throughout the world. This is due to: 
  1. To ensure that socio-economic and industrial structures 
are balanced and national economic policy is implemented, all 
countries grant low-interest, concessional loans to industries 
and enterprises needing support, most commonly to agriculture. 
As agriculture is not only seasonal, which limits its 
production and commodity fund turnover rates, but also 
restricted in its production process by natural changes, such as 
weather, the state must support it. Moreover, as foreign trade 
involves factors, such as international competition, how a 
country's products can occupy world markets, and a country's 
standing and prestige in the international family, all countries 
provide concessional loans to export firms and export-commodity 
bases. 
  2. Low-interest, concessional loans are a feature of a 
market economy per se. While many comrades have held in recent 
years that a market economy equals competition and the 
enterprise operating target is profits, this is in fact a great 
misunderstanding. On market economy terms, there are two types 
of enterprises, one competitive and the other not. The 
competitive type targets its operations at profits, while the 
noncompetitive type does not, acting rather in the interests of 
the public welfare of the whole society. These two types of 
enterprises are interdependent. 
  While the competitive type of enterprise is factories, 
stores, and service trades (including commercial banks), the 
noncompetitive type is mostly public welfare enterprises. The 
state's administrative policy and method differ for these two 
types of enterprise. Competitive enterprises can be pushed 
toward markets, allowing market competition itself to determine 
prices, product quality, and variety. But for noncompetitive 
enterprises, the state first needs to set prices, to keep them 
from asking exorbitant prices due to the lack of competition. 
This price-setting is aimed at 1) stabilizing living standards 
for the whole society and 2) spurring better operating 
management to lower costs. But premised on set prices, if 
temporary losses are sustained due to unpredictable factors, 
what is to be done? The state can adopt two methods, one being 
to rationally adjust prices. But as this leaves prices unable 
to change normally, only going up, and being very hard to lower, 
it should generally not be adopted. The other method is to take 
from the fat to pad the lean, by granting low-interest, 
concessional loans to this type of enterprise, to help them 
regain their strength and improve their operating management. 
It is thus obvious that policy loans are granted mainly to 
enterprises that cannot aim at profitmaking, while being saddled 
with the missions of meeting the public welfare needs of the 
whole society and implementing state macroeconomic policy. And 
the emergence and existence of this type of enterprise are 
inevitable consequences of market economy conditions. 
<H5>  II. The Features of China's Policy Loans </H5>
  The current reality for China's specialized banks is that 
making policy loans is synonomous with running a business at a 
loss. Term deposits of longer than one year with annual interest 
of about 10 percent at prevailing interest rates make up 80 
percent of current specialized bank savings deposits, while the 
four types in 21 categories of low-interest, concessional loans 
averaging only 6.68 percent interest account for one-third of 
all specialized bank loans. It has been calculated that the 
ICBC's current deposit-loan interest difference is only 0.82 
percent which, under normal conditions should be 2 points, and 
that the AB loses 28 yuan for every 1,000 it lends. 
  So do low-interest, concessional, policy loans truely mean 
that losses are certain? No! 
  First, theoretically, low-interest, concessional, policy 
loans are certainly not tied inevitably to losses. All 
enterprises must strive for their own fund balance, which is a 
market-economy demand. 
  Second, macroeconomically, enterprises that target their 
production operations at profits seek mainly immediate 
interests, while enterprises supported by policy loans focus on 
the future, sacrificing some immediate profits for greater 
future ones. This is because as long as the subsistence and 
welfare needs of all residents are met, and the society's 
industrial structure and product mix are rationally adjusted, 
the whole society's economy will be bound to be consolidated 
quickly and grow in a sustained way, which cannot generally be 
achieved by profit-targeted enterprises. In China specifically, 
policy loans have the following features: 
  1. China's policy loans are needed for market-economy 
development. While the main reason for this was noted above, it 
needs to be emphasized here that enterprises whose production 
operations are based on policy, or those that cannot compete or 
whose production operations cannot be targeted at profits, are 
not necessarily all in the ranks of those that receive policy 
loans. The main features of China's policy loans are too many 
and too indiscriminate. By now, China's low-interest, 
concessional, policy loans come in four general types in 21 
categories, mainly such as grain, cotton, and edible oil loans, 
export purchasing loans, civil administration welfare factory 
loans, development loans to old, minority-nationality, border, 
and poverty-stricken areas, bullion loans, anti-poverty discount 
loans, and specific-item loans. In addition, we grant 
differentiated interest-rate loans, actually also low-interest, 
concessional ones, to sectors, such as agriculture, coal, crude 
recovery, power, transportation, and iron and steel. While 
Western countries also grant low-interest loans, they do not 
grant as many as we, with the ones they do being handled not by 
banks, but rather by the government sector. 
  2. A conscientious analysis of China's current low-interest, 
concessional, policy loans shows that many of them seem 
irrational, being the aftermath of a planned economy, which 
should be gradually adjusted as our market economy is perfected. 
  3. As policy loans do not equal losing ones, enterprises 
need 
to strive for their own fund balance. 
<H5>  III. Policy Loan Funding Sources </H5>
  As policy loans are determined by the existence of 
enterprises of two different types on market-economy terms, 
their funding sources should depend mainly on taking from the 
fat to pad the lean, not on capital financing. This means that: 
  1. Policy loan funding sources should depend mainly on state 
revenue. While the difference between policy and ordinary loans 
is apparently higher or lower interest rates, it is actually a 
matter of strategy and tactics. Without long-range objectives, 
immediate goals lose direction, becoming unchecked and 
unsustainable; and without immediate goals, long-range 
objectives are also unattainable. So policy-loan funding 
sources should depend mainly on taking the fat from profitmaking 
enterprises to pad the lean of policy enterprises. 
  2. Might we draw on postal savings or central bank funds? 
Generally speaking, we should not. This is because what postal 
savings absorb is surplus funds from residents' daily lives, in 
which the cost of absorption is too high, with demand deposits, 
as well as term deposits with certification, being withdrawable 
at any time. Using such funds to grant policy loans is buying 
high and selling low, as well as being too risky. Central bank 
fund sources are mainly the five of enterprise deposits, revenue 
deposits, organizational deposits, residents' savings deposits, 
and self-owned funds, with the first four being unmoveable. This 
is because that is money that is deposited there temporarily to 
be withdrawn before long. If we took it out to do discount 
business, leaving us with less of the people's money, how could 
we accout for this? As to the central bank's own funds, while 
these are theoretically moveable, they have been used up through 
overdraft borrowing since our huge fiscal deficits appeared in 
1981. Of course, while they may be slightly employable for 
adjustments, this would be limited as to both time and amount, 
leaving very little room for maneuver. 
<H5>  IV. Who Should Run the Policy Bank? </H5>
  On market-economy terms, commercial banks can act only in 
accordance with the law, having to observe all central bank 
legal regulations, but no longer having a higher authority as to 
daily operations. But a policy bank differs, in that it is not 
an enterprise, but rather a state tool for implementing economic 
policy, meaning that it should have a higher authority. But who 
should this higher authority be? While this has generally been 
determined to be the State Council, which is of course most 
ideal, the concern is that the State Council has too many 
subsidiaries, leading to the fear that it will follow the past 
practice of entrusting a ministry or commission with delegated 
management, thus causing more problems. 
  As a policy bank is called a "bank," it should be held in 
trust by the central bank. But we hold that China's policy 
bank is certainly not a bank in the traditional, internationally 
recognized sense. It is not a banking enterprise that 
independently transacts deposits, loans, and exchange, but 
rather actually a department that handles appropriations. 
Overseas, most policy bank functions are handled by the treasury 
sector or other agencies, with no central bank meddling. 
  China's central bank should not hold our policy bank in 
trust, as we have learned the following lessons: 1) In the last 
decade, centralized management of working capital has turned 
into centralized guarantee of working capital, with loans 
replacing appropriations. 2) Since the founding of the PRC, the 
credit funds allocated to banks by state revenue over the years 
have evolved from allocation shortages to basically no 
allocations. These lessons illustrate in a concentrated way a 
problem: that financial allocations are unreliable. While some 
might say that policy bank funding sources are financial 
allocations, but policy bank business is held in trust by the 
central bank, the central bank could absolutely not agree to 
this easily. This is absolutely not due to sectarian bias, but 
proceeds rather from economic stability. In China, where our 
monetary base and monetary-multiplier principles still cannot 
play a full role in controlling currency issue, currency 
stabilization still depends on administrative force for 
restraint. China's central bank is in a state of on the one 
hand, being the only organ of currency issue, and on the other 
still having very weak macroeconomic control might. These two 
features mean that if our central bank meddled in our policy 
bank, in times of extreme fiscal difficulties and allocation 
inabililty, the central bank could overcome its difficulties 
only by issuing currency, which would cause inflation, which in 
turn would infringe on the interests of the people throughout 
China, so would be absolutely unacceptable. 
  So if our policy bank must be held in trust, then this 
burden 
ought to be shouldered by state revenue [the treasury]. The 
treasury is not an organ of currency issue, being able to act 
based only on the amount of money that it has. If it overspends 
in one area, it must economize in another. Of course, the 
central bank must not just look on unconcerned either, but 
rather should do all possible to assist the treasury in 
overcoming difficulties.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Jizhou (3769 3444 3166): "What Does the </F>
PBC Change From `Looking for Subsistence' To `Being Given 
Subsistence' Illustrate?--A Brief Discussion of the PBC's New 
Financial Management System"] 
  [Text] The People's Bank of China [PBC] has completely 
reformed its financial system in 1994, the key items of which 
are eliminating profit retention, being exempt from the payment 
of all taxes, and practicing an independent financial-budget 
management system. Using a not necessarily completely fitting 
metaphor, it is much as if the PBC's situation has changed 
suddenly from its past "looking for subsistence" to "being given 
subsistence" by the state. Why have we conducted this reform? 
This has become a matter of great concern to those within and 
outside of the PBC system. 
  A financial system in the final analysis is a product of an 
economic system. A particular economic system is bound to 
produce a corresponding financial system. And a particular 
financial system is also bound to reflect the inherent laws and 
demands of a particular economic system. Since 1984, the PBC has 
begun to exercise the special functions of a central bank, no 
longer concurrently handling industrial and commercial credit 
business. But its financial system has been essentially one of 
financial insurance, with its spending characterized by cost 
management and overall expense-rate management, and its profit 
distribution by the profit-retention system, with tax payment 
according to law, as well as setting aside of credit funds. 
This means that on one hand, the PBC has had to endeavor to 
explore ways to establish a new central banking system and 
exercise its particular functions, while on the other having to 
do all possible to consider ways to resolve its own "livelihood" 
and subsistence problems. As the PBC, as the central bank, has 
long been subject to a relative shortage of all funds, it has 
been hard for it to meet reform needs and normal expenditures 
for business development and functional activities. But as our 
banking reform has intensified, it is now clear that the major 
functions of our reformed PBC are to formulate and apply 
monetary policy, preserving currency stability, and to exercise 
strict oversight of financial institutions, ensuring the safe 
and effective operation of our banking system. So it was 
imperative that we reform our former financial-insurance 
financial system, by establishing an independent 
financial-budget management system that differs from both our 
fiscal budget and our administrative institution budget, to 
reflect the relative independence of our central bank. As to 
future central bank functions, basic currency handling authority 
and credit scope regulation authority will be concentrated in 
the head office, while branches will be responsible for 
financial oversight, investigation of statistics, management of 
the treasury, foreign exchange control, inter-branch clearing, 
cash allocation, and interim position adjustment. With PBC 
revenue concentrated mostly in the head office, and spending 
mostly by branches, it will be only a uniform budget-management 
system that will essentially better resolve the PBC's financial 
revenue and expenditure problems. 
  The old PBC's financial sources were mainly profit 
retention. 
In other words, the next year's spending by the PBC depended 
mainly on its current year's revenue. In recent years, as 
capital construction has expanded, and new business, such as 
securities and capital lending, have developed, all costs have 
grown faster, causing great spending pressure. This has 
objectively spurred the central bank, particularly branches at 
all levels, to strive for more profits, by doing all possible to 
diversify and develop new funding sources. This state of "the 
central bank not acting like a central bank, and specialized 
banks not acting like specialized banks," was undoubtedly 
exceptionally adverse to the central bank doing a good job of 
financial macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as not 
contributing to honest administration. Thus, instituting the 
new budget system, with the clear division of revenue and 
expenditures into "two lines" with no links, so that proper 
earnings are recouped and proper expenditures are rationally 
met, can eliminate the PBC's tendency to strive for profits, 
enabling it to better focus its main energies on implementing 
monetary policy, to bring its financial macroeconomic regulation 
and control function into full play. 
  As to the financial systems of central banks in certain 
developed countries, while they may differ somewhat, what they 
all have in common is central bank independence. Our new 
financial system not only draws on overseas central bank 
financial systems, but also reflects China's central banking 
features and needs. In addition, we have also paid attention to 
the relations among all parties, instituting a central bank 
financial system that conforms to international practice while 
being suited to China's particular conditions. 
  Our new financial management system is one of "uniform 
budgeting, graded management, independent accounting, and 
centralized responsibility for profits and losses." Our 
fundamental principles for implementing this financial system 
were mainly the two of practicing an independent 
financial-budget management system and ensuring all 
expenditures. Meanwhile, we considered that PBC profits are a 
key component of state revenue and, under current conditions of 
state revenue difficulties, PBC spending needs to be strictly 
controlled and managed. So our formulation of the PBC 
financial system and its future financial management had to 
consider the following areas: 1) it had to reflect the PBC's 
independent budget-management authority, with all financial 
revenue and expenditure budgeting being examined and approved by 
the head office; 2) it had to conform to PBC features, with 
spending meeting the rational needs of normal business 
development; 3) it had to tighten revenue control, with revenue 
being recouped according to provision, and no arbitrary 
reduction of revenue or concession of profits, to ensure state 
revenue growth; 4) it had to observe state financial laws and 
regulations, with a rigorous financial management system, 
advocacy of the spirit of hard work, industry, and thrift, 
strict control of budgets, economy in all spending, and 
subjection to state revenue and auditing financial oversight. 
  The PBC's independent budget-management system is a new 
model 
and new system, the outcome of intensified banking reform. As 
this reform is wide in scope, with a heavy workload, and quite 
heavy technical demands and many meticulous management tasks, so 
that many historical leftovers cannot be resolved at once, it 
needs to be carried out positively and safely. We now 
especially need to guard against the two tendencies of drawing 
up too large budgets and easing revenue control, by doing a good 
job of dovetailing the old and new systems, to prevent 
unnecessary losses due to management mistakes. We need to 
understand that our new financial system is absolutely not 
merely to resolve the PBC's "subsistence" problems, nor is it a 
replay of the "iron ricebowl" system. It shows that China's 
central bank has begun to mature, with a stronger macroeconomic 
regulation and control capability, while also being a brand new 
yardstick, with new standards for starting an overall, accurate, 
and specific investigation of the work and management levels of 
the central bank at all levels. So implementing the new 
financial system is not a matter merely for the leadership or 
the accounting sector, but rather will require the joint efforts 
of those throughout the PBC at all levels.

<F P=106> [Article written by Hua Tong (5478 2717) and Duan Shiguang </F>
(3008 0174 0342) of the "Central and Local Tax Allocation 
Relations Reform" Study Group: "On the Classified Tax System's 
Guiding Principles and Its Actual Implementation"--The study 
group is headed by Hua Tong. Other participating units are 
Jiangxi's Provincial Finance Society and Institute of Finance, 
the Financial Ministry's Institute of Science and Technology' s 
District Financial Study Department, and the financial study 
departments of Jiangsu, Gansu, Guizhou, and Ningbo. The first 
paragraph is a source-supplied introduction.] 
  [Text] It is the authors' opinion that in 
implementing the classified tax system, we must adhere to five 
basic principles: We need a unified policy with administrations 
at separate levels; financial authority should match 
administrative authority; the central government should have the 
bulk of financial power, but local interests should be taken 
into consideration; fairness and efficiency should be combined; 
and reform should be radical but gradual. The target mode of 
China's classified tax system is the radical classified tax 
system characterized by different kinds of taxes levied at 
different rates. We can achieve this goal only in steps. That 
is, we must first set up a classified tax framework, then 
amplify the mechanisms to regulate regional interests, and 
lastly, we eliminate the defects left behind by the old system 
and implement a radical classified tax system. The authors 
emphasize that the implementation and operation of the 
classified tax system must be in conjunction with the tax 
reform, and we must also set up corresponding local tax systems 
and improve budget management. 
  The conflicts China is facing as its economic system shifts 
to a different track and our urgent task to increase national 
strength urge and compel us to accelerate the restructuring of 
the financial system. After years of deliberation and 
preparation, the classified tax system, as a modern financial 
management system, has been formally affirmed by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee, and at any 
time, it will move from the theoretical probing and experimental 
stage to the nationwide implementation stage. This is an 
important move to meet the needs of the socialist market 
economic development and to put an end to the dissipation of the 
state's financial strength, the weakening of the central 
authority's regulation and control power, and the financial 
plight of governments at all levels. It is a positive step in 
promoting lawful and scientific financial administration. It is 
an unprecedented change in China's financial system since the 
founding of the nation. This article proposes some guiding 
principles for this reform and for its implementation and 
operation. 
<H5>  I. Guiding Principles and Basic Requirements of the </H5>
Classified Tax System 
  Modern classified tax system is accepted worldwide in 
nations 
that have adopted the market economic system. But different 
countries' classified tax systems have different characteristics 
and contents; each has to do with the respective country's 
situation and financial system. China is a developing nation 
with a socialist market economic system. Its goal must be to 
develop the socialist market economy, vitalize public finance, 
and increase its national strength, so that its classified tax 
system can have contemporary Chinese characteristics. The 
overall requirement is to build a financial operating mechanism 
that meets the needs of the socialist market economy through the 
classified tax system to improve and strengthen the financial 
ministry's functions, mobilize the enthusiasm of the central and 
local governments, distribute the financial strength between 
central and local governments in a scientific and standardized 
way, and achieve financial autonomy at every level within the 
scope stipulated by state laws and national policies. 
Specifically we must abide by the following five principles: 
  1. The principle of unified policy and graded 
administration. China is a unified socialist nation and is 
fundamentally different from countries uder the federal system. 
The most important thing in restructuring the financial system 
is the central government's unified leadership, which is 
manifested primarily in its unified policies and decrees. From 
the point of state finances and taxation, the country's basic, 
and most important, policies and laws and regulations must be 
unified; there can be no flexibility here. This is a point we 
must insist on. This means we must insist that the central 
government has financial leadership and regulation and control 
rights. On the other hand, China is a large multinational state 
with geographic, historical, and environmental differences, and 
unlike some small countries, the central government cannot be 
too broad or too detailed when exercising control; it must give 
play to the role of local governments. Creating an 
administrative hierarchy has important practical implications. 
Localities should be given reasonable autonomy and legislative 
power over regional financial and tax laws and regulations as 
well as methods and systems of operation and interpretation. We 
should adhere to the principle that every level of government 
should have its own administrative power and its share of 
financial power. The central and local authorities have their 
respective duties and responsibilities, and each should suit 
measures to local conditions and manage their own financial 
affairs and balance their own budgets. This is another point we 
must insist on, for failing to do so will render it impossible 
to mobilize local initiative and enthusiasm, and then there will 
be no classified tax to speak of. Under the old system, "every 
measure has a countermeasure"--it was like a chess game between 
those on top and those below; it hindered the country's 
government and weakened public finance. We must insist on 
changes and replace this with a new system of unified policy 
with an administrative hierarchy and which is coordinated 
between the higher and lower levels. 
  2. The principle of matching financial jurisdiction to 
administrative jurisdiction. Any amount of administrative 
power must be guaranteed by the appropriate amount of financial 
power and financial strength. "One must be paid for the amount 
of work one performs"--this is a simple and basic principle. 
Thus, we must determine the amount of administrative authority 
before we determine the amount of financial power. In 
implementing the classified tax system, first, we must draw a 
clear line between the central government's administrative power 
and that of the local governments at different levels. Thereupon 
we can separate the tax categories and delimit the financial 
power. We must make sure that the state and the localities have 
the financial power and the financial strength to carry out 
their respective administrative functions, so as to give 
expression to the principle of integrating responsibilities, 
rights, and privileges. The delineation of administrative power 
involves the restructuring of the political system and the 
standardization of government conduct. We must comply with the 
demands of the modern market economy and reconsider the status, 
function, and role of the state government in society. In the 
past, there were problems of mishandling, abuse, and shirking of 
administrative power among the state government, enterprises, 
and society; between the central and local governments; and 
between the higher and lower level governments. That has to be 
corrected, so that we can radically solve the problem of 
financial misallocation. 
  3. The principle of upholding the central government's 
dominant financial role while taking care of local 
interests. A strong and effective central government is the 
organizational guarantee of the proper administration of 
important state affairs and solidarity of the people of all 
regions and nationalities. An important part of being "strong 
and effective" is having financial strength. If the central 
government is not backed by substantial financial strength, 
state administration and macroeconomic regulation and control 
will be but empty words. In recent years, the central 
government's income as a percentage of the national income has 
been declining steadily, and by 1992, it only came to 38.6 
percent, which marked the lowest point since the founding of the 
PRC. This percentage not only was below that of nations with a 
centralized state power system but was also much lower than 
nations with a federal system of separation of power. Worries 
about "heavy branches on a weak trunk" are not just alarmist 
talk; we must be on the alert. On the other hand, while we 
insist on giving the central government the dominant financial 
role, we must take care of local financial interests and give 
the localities--financial administration at the first level--the 
necessary political power and some important sources of 
revenue, so as to fully mobilize local initiative and 
enthusiasm in taking care of their financial matters as their 
own masters. We must not over-correct the problem and go back to 
the old "state monopoly of revenues and expenditures." 
  4. The principle of balancing fairness and 
efficiency. Economic development requires efficiency; 
social stability demands fairness. Efficiency comes first, but 
we must take fairness into consideration and combine fairness 
and efficiency. This is an important principle in China's system 
of income distribution. Thus, linking the benefits of economic 
development to the government's revenues and expenditures is a 
necessity; it complies with the needs of the socialist market 
economic system. In establishing a financial system, it is 
understandable that for some time, we must give consideration to 
the vested interests of the economically well-developed coastal 
regions, but as a unified socialist nation, large disparities in 
reveue and expenditure and living conditions among different 
regions not only has an adverse effect on the underdeveloped 
regions but will ultimately jeoparidze the long-term development 
of the developed regions. One of the central government's 
fundamental functions is to balance the regions through macro 
regulation and control and reasonably limit the differences 
among the regions and prevent the gap from widening. In 
particular, there must be a protective policy for public 
services in the low-income regions. We must scientifically 
determine a poverty-line; regions that fall below this 
poverty-line must be given the necessary assistance. As for the 
autonomous nationality regions and provinces deemed their 
equivalent, we should extend exceptional care in accordance with 
laws toward the minority nationalities. This is out of economic 
consideration, but it is out of political consideration too. 
  5. The principle of combining reform's radical nature 
and the need to proceed gradually. The classified tax 
system involves the comprehensive reallocation and readjustment 
of financial strength among the governments and among the 
regions. It affects the economic interests of all parties. We 
can imagine how sensitive the issues, how sharp the conflicts, 
and how heated the debates can be. Adding China's complicated 
situation and the lack of proper conditions in many areas, 
reform is bound to be difficult and cannot be achieved in one 
step; we must proceed gradually. Therefore, we must insist on 
two things: First, we must set the goal of implementing a 
scientific, radical classified tax system nationwide; this goal 
should never change. Second, to achieve this goal, we must work 
hard to create the conditions and move in steady steps until we 
succeed. In short, the determination of our reform goal should 
be positve and radical; the implementation of our reform should 
be gradual and gentle. This will reduce friction and avoid 
shock, so that we can smoothly attain our reform goal. 
  To uphold the above five principles, we must accomplish the 
"six conducive" and "two guarantees." That is, everything must 
be conducive to the construction of a unified socialist market; 
conducive to the central government's effective macroeconomic 
regulation and control; conducive to the local governments' 
autonomous management and lawful financial administration under 
the supervision of the people's congresses at their 
corresponding levels; conducive to encouraging the local 
governments to show interest in local public welfare 
undertakings and the building and preservation of public 
facilities; conducive to scientifically smoothing relations 
between the central and local governments at all levels and 
clarifying the interest boundaries to reduce friction; conducive 
to tax collection and management and prevention of loss of tax 
revenues. On those bases, we can guarantee that the new system 
will work as expected and guarantee that when the system changes 
tracks, it can shift without confusion and change in an orderly 
fashion, so that revenues will increase and budgets will balance 
at all levels. 
<H5>  II. Choice of a Specific Form of Classified Tax System and </H5>
Its Implementation Procedure 
  As said earlier, the goal of China's restructuring of the 
financial system is to implement the radical classified tax 
system. The so called radical classified tax system is a graded 
financial administration system of classified taxes based on 
socialist market economic principles and public finance 
theories. The "radical" nature of this kind of classified tax 
system is manifested not only in its clear-cut tax categories, 
but more importantly, it is manifested in its scientific, 
legislated, standardized administration of revenues and 
expenditures at separate levels. Today, in nations that have 
relatively sound classified tax systems, they usually take one 
of two forms: one form allows revenue-sharing taxes and the 
other does not. Judging by China's situation, without 
revenue-sharing taxes, it will be difficult to take care of 
central and local interests at the same time. Revenue-sharing 
taxes provide a "common point" between central and local 
financial interests and facilitate economic development. 
However, revenue-sharing should not take the form of percentage 
retention; instead, it should be in the form of "taxing from the 
same sources" but at different rates. The central and local 
governments' revenues may be collected at different rates by 
separate tax organs or by the same organ on their separate 
behalf; however, each should have autonomous power to tax, not 
to tax, to exempt, or reduce taxes without interference from the 
others. Under this method, the delineation of financial power 
and financial sources is very clear, which is completely in line 
with the principles of the radical classified tax system. 
Therefore, it is our opinion that China's classified tax system 
should be the radical classified tax system characterized by 
separate tax categories and different tax rates. 
  Implementing the radical classified tax system has broad 
ramifications and is a complicated, systematic project. In view 
of China's actual situation and realistic conditions, it will be 
very difficult to succeed overnight. We must keep pace with the 
restructuring of the economic system and adhere to the principle 
of combining the radical and gradual nature of reform and 
proceed in three steps: 
  Step one: Set up the framework and implement a 
preliminary classified tax system. 
  The preliminary classified tax system is not a complete 
classified tax system. Its main purpose is to set up a framework 
according to the principles and needs of the classified system 
to create a mechanism in the near-term to lay the foundation to 
promote and deepen the restructuring of the tax system. The 
preliminary classified tax system is born out of the contract 
system and bears two characteristics: On the one hand, it has 
the basic substance of a modern classified tax system. For 
example, we can delineate administrative and financial power 
according to the classified system, concentrate financial power 
in the hands of the central government, and set up separate 
central tax and local tax collection organs. On the other hand, 
it retains many of the original features of the contract system. 
For example, we will still implement percentage 
revenue-retention, set the revenue and expenditure bases using 
the base method, collect income tax based on enterprises' 
jurisdictional relationship, and retain the original method of 
delivering subsidies to the higher levels. When reform first 
begins, these measures are inevitable and are necessary. Its a 
transitional format that suits the realistic conditions. 
  Step two: Strengthen the regional interest regulation 
mechanisms and further amplify the classified tax system. 
  Step one of the restructuring of the tax system tries to 
preserve the original interest pattern and, on that basis, 
allocates financial strength according to the classified tax 
system only for the incremental portion; it is but a fledgling 
classified tax system. According to the principles of the 
modern classified tax system, there are still many unresolved 
essential questions we have not dealt with. In particular, we 
have not achieved the goals of macroeconomic regulation of 
regional financial interests. Therefore, the main purpose of 
step two of the reform is to amplify the substantive contents of 
tax assignment according to the needs of the classified tax 
system by focusing on the readjustment of the interest pattern. 
Specifically, the most important thing is to implement the 
transfer of payment system and gradually introduce the factoring 
method for calculating expenditures in the process and solve the 
problem of the widening gap between the rich and poor regions, 
so as to give expression to the state's macroeconomic regulation 
and control policy. At the same time, we should create 
conditions for further deepening the reform to install the 
classified tax system via financial legislation, by building a 
tax collection and management contingent, and by developing 
sources of revenue, so that we can make the "quantitative 
accumulation" to facilitate the transition from the preliminary 
classified tax system to the radical classified tax system. 
  Step three: Eliminate the defects left by the old 
system and implement the radical classified tax system. 
  This reform step is founded primarily on the previous two 
steps to further smooth relations, perfect the system, define 
responsibilities and rights and privileges, and eliminate the 
defects left by the old system. It changes the percentage 
revenue retention system to a system of classified taxes 
collected at different rates. We should go all out to promote 
the factoring method according to objective, scientific, and 
standardized needs to really smash the original, improper 
interest pattern, so as to truly meet the needs of radical 
classified tax system. Specifically, we should: (i) clearly and 
properly delineate administrative and financial power to comply 
with political reform and adhere to the principle of b alancing 
power and obligations; (ii) establish and reinforce the central 
government's dominant financial role, perfect the transfer of 
payment system, and amplify the macroeconomic regulation and 
control system to suit the socialist market economic mechanism; 
(iii) amplify and strengthen the central and local tax 
collection and management system and create and develop major 
sources of tax revenues at different levels to meet the needs of 
financial administration at separate levels; (iv) set up rigid 
budget constraints to meet the needs of financial autonomy at 
each level. We expect that this radical classified tax system 
can be implemented nationwide by the end of the century. 
<H5>  III. Actual Implementation and Operation of the Classified </H5>
Tax System 
  Overall, the implementation and operation of the classified 
tax system should coincide with tax reform to link the 
restructuring of the tax system to the new form of taxation. 
Specifically: 
  1. Delineate administrative power and assign spending 
responsibility. The delineation of administrative power is 
based on the responsibility of each level of government as 
assigned in the restructuring of the political system. This task 
must be carried out as meticulously, quantitatively, clearly, 
and scientifically as possible based on the separation of 
government and enterprises and as government functions change to 
meet the needs of macroeconomic regulation and control. Besides 
taking care of their respective administrative expenditures, the 
central government's spending should cover the state's key basic 
constructions, national defense, foreign relations and foreign 
aid expenditures, the state's share of price subsidies, interest 
and principal payment of domestic and foreign loans. Local 
expenditures should cover local basic constructions, urban 
construction and public undertakings, agricultural support, 
pension and welfare, and local share of price subsidies. Certain 
factors should be used to determine various social development 
and public welfare expenditures to guarantee the necessary 
spending in carrying out the government's duties and make sure 
that every taxpayer receives the same social services. But we 
must realize that the classified tax system can only be 
implemented in gradual steps, and we should allow for a 
crude-to-refined process (especially in 1994 when we build the 
framework, we should not go into great details,) but we must 
plant our foothold on the present but look to the future and pay 
attention to linking up with our long-term goals. 
  2. Delineate financial authority and assign 
jurisdiction over specific tax categories. After 
delineating administrative power, we must delineate financial 
power based on the mix of tax categories created by the 
restructuring of the tax system. As for where specifically to 
draw the line, it is our opinion that tariffs, value-added tax 
and consumption tax collected by customs, and revenues handed 
over by the railroad, post and telecommunications, banking, and 
insurance departments and so on should go to the central 
government. Agricultural and livestock taxes and odds-and-ends 
taxes which have always been collected locally should go to the 
localities. Opinions are more or less unanimous on these, and we 
need not elaborate here. The two main areas that are more 
controversial are: One, circulation tax which comprises more 
than 80 percent of the financial revenues. The localities will 
find it unacceptable if this tax goes to the central 
governments, and vice versa. The other is enterprises' income 
tax. This has to do with the original source of revenue of 
various levels of governments and the localities; it has 
deep-rooted blood ties with governments at all levels, and it 
will be equally difficult no matter who ends up with the 
jurisdiction. According to the financial ministry's plans, 
consumption tax goes to the central government, business tax 
goes to the localities, value-added tax will be shared, and 
enterprises income tax will continue to be levied according to 
enterprises' jurisdictional relationship, and the amount will be 
based on 1993's revenues and expenditures. In our opinion, this 
program may be far from meeting the needs of the classified tax 
system and is in fact a new version of the old "double-track 
system," but in view of today's situation and conditions, it is 
our best option and the only program everybody can accept at 
this early stage of the restructuring of the tax system; it is 
necessary and workable. However, as the restructuring of the tax 
system deepens, we must gradually make improvements and 
adjustments, so as to better give expression to the principles 
of the classified tax system. First, the proportion of 
revenue-sharing tax should shrink; percentage revenue-retention 
cannot be applied on a long-term basis. Tax collection based on 
enterprises' jurisdictional relations should also be changed. 
Specifically, (i) value-added tax should be changed from a 
"shared" tax to the central government's "exclusive" tax; it 
will be the central government's main tax category which 
guarantees its dominant financial role, so that it will have the 
financial strength to implement macroeconomic regulation and 
control. (ii) Enterprise income tax should be changed to 
"shared" tax and administrative subordination relationship 
should be ignored. Central and local governments will tax the 
same sources at different rates to encourage both to be 
concerned about enterprises' management and administration and 
economic efficiency and prevent governments at different levels 
from treati ng enterprises differently based on their 
jurisdictional ties, so as to facilitate enterprises' fair 
competition. 
  3. Implement a reasonable transfer of payment system 
based on the central government's macro regulation and control 
needs. According to the needs of the classified tax system, 
most of the income should go to the central government, and most 
of the spending should be in the localities. Financially, the 
central government needs room for maneuvering to give expression 
to the state's macroeconomic decisions and intentions through 
various kinds of rebates and subsidies. We should change today's 
"upward flow of funds," which in some sense puts the central 
government under the control of the localities, to "downward 
flow of funds," which gives the central government macro 
regulation and control power over the localities. We need the 
following types of subsidies: (i) Balancing subsidy--systemic 
subsidy used mainly to balance local budgets and help the 
localities to meet basic expenditures for carrying out the 
government's functions. (ii) General subsidy--used mainly on 
projects which the state wants but the localities cannot afford 
to undertake because of lack of financial means, or on projects 
which when taken by one locality will benefit many. For example, 
subsides for water conservancy projects, compulsory education, 
disaster prevention and relief, immunization, and family 
planning. (iii) Special subsidy--subsidy for large construction 
projects, agricultural development matching funds, and price 
subsidies and so on. (iv) Extraordinary subsidy--primarily to 
aid large natural disasters and other extraordinary events. In 
short, through transfer of payment, we can strengthen the 
financial ministry's role as lever and strengthen the central 
government's macroeconomic regulation and control capability. In 
the future, the high level financial departments should guide 
the lower level departments not by "red-heading documents" and 
administrative orders but mainly by enticing them with financial 
gains. 
  4. Actively create conditions and adopt unified 
objective standards and scientific method to determine revenue 
and expenditure bases. One of the important features of the 
classified tax system is the adoption of the factoring method to 
calculate revenue and expenditure, but because of various 
limitations, implementing that method requires a long process. 
Except for the first year of the classified tax system--that is, 
in 1994--when we will continue to use the base-year method 
because we don't have much time, we should adopt some 
transitional methods in subsequent years and draw closer to the 
factoring method in steps. Specifically, we should calculate the 
per-capita financial revenue capacity based on the legally-set 
tax rate and actual tax base and other factors and use those as 
basis for determining the percentage or amount of various 
subsidies. In calculating spending, we can use a combination of 
the factoring and base methods. That is, we should adhere to the 
principle of the factoring method, treat the original base as a 
"historical factor," take it into consideration along with other 
objective factors, and integrate ordinary needs with 
extraordinary needs and theoretical spending base with actual 
spending base. While we should take vested interests into 
consideration, we should not try to protect all vested 
interests. We should make ordinary needs the base and use 
extraordinary needs to readjust and amend ordinary needs. In 
actual operation, first, we should determine a national 
per-capita spending norm and then consider various objective 
factors that can affect that norm and come up with a revision 
coefficient for making revisions and adjustments and verify all 
aspects of the spending base. At the beginning, we can use a 
"rough" figure (be as simple and direct as possible.) The 
proportion of objective factors can be smaller, and except for 
such basic factors as population, land, and administrative 
districts which determine expenditures, the main factor is the 
special subsidies. Later, the objective factors should 
proportionally play a larger role and historical factors a 
smaller role, and we should be even more scientific and precise 
in our calculations until we implement the factoring method in 
full. 
<H5>  IV. Establishing Local Taxation Systems </H5>
  The core of the local tax systems consists of three issues: 
the scope of local income, legislative and administrative 
jurisdiction, and installation of tax organs. 
  1. Expand the scope of local tax revenues. We hope 
to see a gradual increase in the share of local taxes to 30 
percent of the state's total tax revenues and 70-80 percent of 
the total local revenues. We must foster and develop sources of 
tax revenues using this as basis. In developing local tax 
systems, we should expand local revenues' "two proportions": The 
first is the proportion of local revenues to local national 
income. In particular, we should change the situation where the 
non-state-owned economy contributes a disproportionate share of 
revenues. Secondly, when local governments gather funds in 
society, they should increase the proportion of tax revenues and 
reduce the share of non-tax revenues, so as to gradually 
eliminate the "three chaos." After the implementation of the 
classified tax system, in the near-term, the bulk of local tax 
revenues will come from the circulation and service sectors. 
Therefore the localities must vigorously develop tertiary 
industry and enliven commercial circulation, and while they 
actively promote the development of the state-owned economy and 
collective economy, they must also encourage individual and 
private economies. In addition, we must pay attention to 
protecting, developing, and utilizing local resources and 
develop more sources of resource tax (resource tax should best 
be allocated to the localities or be shared based on different 
tax rates in the future.) 
  2. Expand local (referring to provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions) legislative organs' 
power to legislate local taxation. Basic laws pertaining to 
local taxation nationwide should be formulated by the central 
government, and within the scope of the basic laws' regulations, 
local people's congresses may consider local conditions to 
formulate implementation methods and individual laws applicable 
to some local tax categories. They should have the right to 
determine the scope of taxation, the tax rate, the amount, and 
the starting point of taxation as well as the right to decide 
when to begin or stop taxing and to grant tax exemption and 
reduction. We must enhance the local people's congresses' 
legislative authority and strengthen the local people's 
congresses and governments' concept of being responsible to the 
masses and the taxpayers. Characteristically, local taxes are 
"taken from the localities to be spent on the localities," and 
the localities should have greater autonomy. They must "open the 
front door and close the back door." As long as the central 
government's interests are not being compromised, as long as the 
unity of the nation's basic orders is not jeopardized, the 
central government should not interfere with the tax laws and 
regulations local people's congresses have introduced through 
normal legislative processes. Central authorities and local 
supervisory departments may check and rectify taxes and fees 
that have not been legislated through normal procedure, and 
local parties may refuse to carry out the orders. 
  3. Set up branch tax organs. In the wake of the 
implementation of the classified tax system, we must set up 
separate central and local tax organs to collect and manage 
state and local taxes. We have already reached a consensus on 
this point. The question now is how to set up those tax organs 
after introducing the classified tax system. We have two 
options: One, we can turn the existing tax organs into state tax 
bureaus and local tax bureaus. Two, we can turn the existing tax 
organs into state tax bureaus and set up local tax bureaus using 
the agricultural tax department and financial department as 
bases. We think the second option is better, because we can 
avoid the trouble and complication of having to "divide up the 
people, household, and properties" in the process; it can help 
steady the cadres' minds and will not affect current tax 
collection. Moreover, letting the localities themselves set up 
local tax organs is something local governments value and 
support, and they can provide the conditions and basis in terms 
of setup, funding, and leadership and functional mainstay. Our 
concrete suggestions for setting up local tax organs are: (i) 
Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should be the 
basic units responsible for setting up local tax organs. They 
should suit measures to local conditions. In principle, local 
tax bureaus should be set up in provinces (municipalities and 
autonomous regions,) cities (autonomous prefectures,) and 
counties (cities); city-administered districts should have local 
tax branch bureau; township and urban district branch bureaus 
should set up local tax offices. As the provincial government's 
agencies, prefectural administrative offices generally should 
not set up local tax bureaus, but, if agreed by the province or 
autonomous region, some localities may set up local tax bureaus 
so long as they retain their existing prefecture-level budgetary 
status. (ii) Local financial departments and local tax organs 
should implement the leadership management system of "hanging up 
two signs but having one leading group." The head of the 
province-level financial department (bureau) should serve as 
head of the province-level local tax bureau; financial bureau 
chiefs and department heads at below-province-level become local 
tax bureau chiefs and local tax department heads at the 
corresponding levels. Local tax bureaus should not set up party 
organs; they should be led by the financial departments' party 
organs at the corresponding levels. (iii) Local tax system at 
above county-level will not provide vertical leadership; the 
higher-level tax departments are responsible for guiding and 
supervising lower-level local tax departments. Urban local tax 
branch offices and township (town) local tax offices are 
agencies of local tax bureaus at the next-higher level; their 
bureau chiefs and department heads are appointed and dismissed 
by the higher-level local tax bureaus, and a dual leadership 
system should be implemented, with the higher-level local tax 
bureaus having more say. (iv) Construction of local tax organs 
must begin before the classified tax system is introduced and 
should go into operation when the new system goes into effect. 
The most urgent task now is to develop the system, set up the 
framework, and hang up the shingle, and we can worry about 
personnel and facilities later. 
<H5>  V. Improve Government Budget Management According to </H5>
Classified Tax Principles 
  To implement the classified tax system, we must make budget 
management even more legislation-oriented, more standardized, 
and more systematic, so as to truly give expression to the 
principle that each level of political power can administer its 
own finances and has its own budget. 
  1. We must have independent budgets at separate 
levels. Setting up independent budgets at separate levels 
is the centralized manifestation of graded financial 
administration. In some sense, China's existing local budgets 
are budget in name only; in fact they are not independent, and 
they have no fixed source of income. Local budgeted income and 
spending are include in the state's total budget; there is no 
independent legislative right to have a budget. Therefore, we 
must promptly strengthen budget legislation and follow the 
Constitution to delineate the budget management jurisdiction of 
the people's congresses and their standing committees and of 
governments at all levels and their financial offices and 
clarify the central and local government organs' authority in 
checking, approving, legislating, and supervising the budgets. 
For each level to administer its finances and have its own 
budget, we must separate local budgets from the state budget, so 
that the state's budget only include the central government's 
budget. Localities should gather their own income and plan their 
own spending according to their scope of responsibilities and 
amount of local taxes when preparing their budgets which must be 
approved by the local legislative organs to make them more rigid 
and binding. 
  2. Establish a budget management system that is 
compatible with the restructuring of the administrative organs 
and the classified tax system. After implementing the 
classified tax system, financial administration should take the 
following form: It should consist of two levels of regulation 
and control (central and provincial,) three levels of 
administration (central, provincial, and county) and four levels 
of operation (central, provincial, county, and township.) We 
should follow this pattern to determine the duties of financial 
administrations at each level and standardize their financial 
conduct and smooth the financial relations between levels. In 
particular, we should standardize the method of computation and 
allocation basis and principle in the transfer of payment 
(subsidies, loans, and interests) from the central government to 
the localities, so as to strengthen the state budget's ability 
to regulate and control and balance society's overall financial 
strength and strengthen its rights and responsibility to guide 
local budgeting behavior. We should further improve the 
budgeting procedure and make the process tighter and more 
scientific. Under the state's unified policy guidance, each 
level should prepare and report its own budget; deficits will 
not be made up by the central government, so that each level 
truly manages and balances its own budget. 
  3. Actively promote the double-entry budget system and 
separate "grocery money" from "operating funds." Double-entry 
budget includes government budget, state-owned asset management 
budget, social security budget and so on. Double-entry budget as 
a modern budget form has inseparable internal ties with the 
classified system and must be installed together. The 
double-entry budget should make laws and regulations the 
criteria and give expression to the characteristics of graded 
financial administration. We should use double-entry budget to 
make financial administration more transparent. It must 
separately reflect how regular and construction funds are being 
balanced, so as to help party and government leaders at all 
levels to make analyses and decisions, facilitate the people's 
congresses in their budget supervision, and help governments at 
all levels to adhere to the principles of "doing one's best and 
gauging one's ability" and "feed the people first, build later." 
The most important thing is to "have food on the table" and then 
worry about construction. No deficit is allowed in regular 
budgets. 
  4. Strengthen ta x collection and management and 
prevent loss of revenue. To separate the "legislation" and 
the "enforcement" of taxation, separate "tax law" from 
"taxation," and tighten the relationship between financial 
administration and taxation, we must include tax work in the 
centralized planning and execution of financial undertakings at 
each level. In the past, we went overboard in reducing taxes and 
yielding profits and incurred losses as a result, and it has 
also led to today's improper interest pattern. That is water 
under the bridge now, but there is still a lesson to be learned. 
We must insist on curbing arbitrary tax reduction and exemption 
and tax contracting in its actual or disguised forms 
(circulation tax should never be contracted; contracting of 
enterprise income tax should be stopped with the "separation of 
taxes and profits.") We must link the strengthening of tax 
management and collection to the anti-corruption activities and 
the crackdown on unhealthy practices in the grass-roots collecti 
on units. We should quickly set up and amplify the tax report 
system and the open tax return system and strengthen supervision 
and auditing. In particular, we should take advantage of the 
fact that after the implementation of the classified tax system, 
local governments at all levels will have a better sense of 
their financial roles, and with the party and government 
leaders' increased attention, we can raise the standard of tax 
collection and management and minimize the incidents of tax 
evasion, tax loopholes, and export tax fraud. 
  5. Improve extra-budgetary fund management and curb 
external fund circulation. Implementation of the classified 
tax system will create the positive environment and conditions 
for improving and strengthening extra-budgetary fund management. 
First, after the implementation of classified tax system, all 
extra-budgetary funds managed by the local financial departments 
can be included in the local budgets, ending the separate 
management of two kinds of funds at the same level. Second, 
administration-related charges must be separated into revenues 
and expenditures and put into the budget. Extra-budgetary funds 
managed by institutional units should be carefully sorted out 
and clarified and included in the local budget where possible. 
The portion that cannot be included in local budgets must be 
included in the unit's revenue and expenditure plan to offset 
spending or to be spent along with the state's allocated funds. 
Moreover, as enterprises' management mechanisms change, and with 
the implementation of the "two principles," and in particular, 
with the gradual improvement of the modern enterprise system, 
the extra-budgetary funds managed by state-owned enterprises is 
essentially different today; they are no longer extra-budgetary 
funds, and after careful checking and examination, they should 
be legally deemed enterprise funds, to be put under enterprises' 
own disposal. Thereupon, we must draw the line between 
government funds and enterprise funds and resolutely block the 
local governments from "stashing their wealth in enterprises," 
preventing them from turning budgetary funds into 
extra-budgetary funds. 
  6. Strengthen financial legislation. We should 
take into consideration the new situation after the 
restructuring of the economic system and the introduction of the 
classified tax system to sort out the financial laws and 
regulations, and depending on the situation, we should amplify, 
supplement, and amend or abolish some of them. We should change 
the old practice of relying on government documents in lieu of 
the people's congress's legislation, and in particular, 
important laws and regulations pertaining to financial 
administration and local taxation must be formally promulgated 
and implemented by local legislative organs according to legal 
procedure. We must resolutely overcome the tendency to rely on 
words instead of laws or power instead of laws and refrain from 
being arbitrary when fulfilling the budget. 
  Besides the above-described situations, in order to meet the 
needs of the classified tax system, we should adopt other budget 
management measures. For example, not only should we use the 
factoring method to calculate and allocate the central 
government's portion of transfer of payment, we should carefully 
separate the transfer of payment in the central government's 
budget, not only in preparing the budget but also in the bases. 
We should strengthen the management of bonds; local-issued bonds 
should be evaluated and debated by the central government. 
<H5>  VI. Several Noteworthy Issues in Implementing the Classified </H5>
Tax System 
  1. The issue of preventing distortions during 
reform. Most people are very confident about the classified 
tax system, but some comrades are worried that because of the 
complicated situation and because of strong local interests, 
there will be a lot of resistance, and if not done right, the 
classified tax system can be distorted: One, we may have the 
"classified tax system as a shell with the contract system at 
its core"; two, we may have "classified tax administration in 
form but in effect we may be "returning to state monopoly of 
revenues ad expenditures." In our view, the first concern is not 
completely baseless, and we should pay close attention. In 
implementing the classified tax system, it is inevitable that we 
will have to make certain "compromises" when dealing with 
various conflicts and interest relations; without compromises, 
we cannot begin to take care of everybody's interests. But this 
kind of compromise should not violate the principles of reform; 
they cannot obliterate the basic characteristics of the 
classified tax system. The so called classified tax must at 
least uphold six things: One, it must not expand the scope of 
percentage revenue retention; two, it must clearly delineate 
administrative power, and financial power and administrative 
power must be fully integrated; three, it must not follow the 
old tax base method; four, it must not allow central and local 
governments to usurp their power in granting tax reductions and 
exemptions; five, it must not permit arbitrary subsidies and 
appropriations; six, it must not perpetrate the kind of "idling" 
seen in the pilot classified tax system. Failing to comply with 
the above, the classified tax system will be a fraud. Of course, 
as we said before, because our classified tax system is based on 
the contract system, at the beginning (specifically in 1994 and 
1995,) it will retain some of the contents and practices of the 
contract system. But in our minds, we must clearly understand 
that this is the new system's temporary "concession" to the old 
system, but it cannot be permanent. To "take a step backward" is 
for the sake of "taking two steps forward." With the passing of 
time and as various conditions are met, traces of the old system 
must slowly be removed, and the reform goals of the new system 
must be gradually attained. This is the concrete meaning of the 
radical and gradual nature of reform. As for the second concern, 
we think it is but a misunderstanding; it reflects errors in 
some comrades' understanding. We should point out that the 
financial contract system was a negation and abandonment of the 
system of state monopoly of revenues and expenditures; it was 
progress. The classified tax system, as an even more advanced 
stage of graded financial management, is an extension and 
advancement of the contract system. In implementing the 
classified tax system, we are correcting the defects of the 
contract system marked by the dispersion of financial strength; 
it strengthens the central government's macroeconomic regulation 
and control and is in no way a "restoration" of the system of 
state monopoly of revenues and expenditure. The biggest 
difference between the system of state monopoly of revenues and 
expenditures and the classified tax system is that the former 
overly emphasizes "centralization" and ignores "autonomy," and 
in some sense it turns the localities into the central 
government's accounting units. The latter system pays attention 
to "proper degree of centralization" while emphasizing "legal 
autonomy," and it adheres closely to the theme of establishing a 
macroeconomic regulation and control system and takes care of 
the central and local governments' interests at the same time, 
and in turn it brings the enthusiasm of the central and local 
governments into play. In our opinion, we must do a good 
propaganda and explanatory job, and at the same time, when 
concentrating the central government's financial strength, we 
should pay attention to the proper "degree" and avoid dampening 
the enthusiasm and initiative of local financial administration. 
Reform must be substantive and avoid giving the people the 
impression that except for handing a few important tax 
categories to the central government, everything will stay the 
same. 
  2. The issue of regulating financial interests among 
the regions. Within a unified country and given the same 
tax burden, citizens living in regions of different economic 
conditions will receive unequal public services. This is unfair 
but realistic. Reasonable and proper adjustments are necessary. 
"Adjust" does not mean "equalize." The national economy is an 
organic integral whole. No one region must support another 
region. Support must be mutual, and without mutual support, 
there will be no rapid and coordinated national economic 
development. We must stand on the high plane of the whole 
situation and adhere to the principle of fairness and efficiency 
to resolve this issue. Specifically, there are two things: One, 
the amount of "grocery money" should be more or less the same 
for all. There should be protective policy to help regions that 
cannot meet basic needs; we must gradually narrow today's 
differences. The other thing is that "operating funds" should be 
planned based on how they affect the layout of and benefit the 
nation's construction; measures should suit the times and local 
conditions. In this respect, perhaps we can learn from 
Australia's and Germany's "equality" and "fairness." We can set 
up some very rigid laws and work out a simple formula for 
computing the transfer of payment, and all subsidies and aids 
must be calculated according to that formula without 
negotiations. 
  3. The issue of the actual application of the factoring 
method. The factoring method is fairly complicated, and we 
will inevitably run into many problems in practice, but we have 
no choice. Without the factoring method, the classified tax 
system will not be a scientific system. Therefore we must 
concentrate our efforts on investigation and studies and learn 
from other countries' experiences. In particular, when choosing 
the factors, we must solicit ideas from all regions. We suggest 
that the financial departments set up a special organ to study 
and work out the factoring method and come up with a specific 
implementation program for the leaders to examine and make a 
decision on and legally put it into effect upon promulgation. 
  4. The issue of resolving the conflict between "tax 
break" and "tax discrimination." Based on the principle of fair 
competition in a market economy, we should set our preferential 
policy based on industry and not on economic nature or 
jurisdictional relations, even less should we extend preferences 
to individual enterprises. To attract foreign investments, we 
should work on improving the investment environment and not 
focus simply on tax reduction or exemption. To extend one-sided 
preferential treatment to foreign-funded enterprises is to 
discriminate against domestic-funded enterprises. In the future, 
domestic and foreign enterprises should pay the same income-tax, 
and except for the free-trade zones, we should not grant foreign 
companies tax-breaks within Chinese territories. After 
implementing the classified tax system, domestic-funded 
enterprises' taxes should be administered at different levels 
according to the law; foreign-funded enterprises' tax collection 
and administration involve national interests and therefore we 
must em phasize centralization. 
  5. The issue of other related reforms. Primarily, 
they are (i) reform of the tax system; (ii) reform of the 
administrative organs' personnel assignment system; (iii) 
further deepening of reforms of various specific financial 
systems based on the criteria of the "two principles"; (iv) 
continued implementation of the "Provision" to change 
enterprises' management mechanisms and go all out to promote 
reform to "separate profits from taxes," (v) reform of the 
state-owned asset management system; (vi) reform of the state 
treasury system. Among these other necessary reforms, the most 
important is the reform of the tax system. It should follow the 
laws of the socialist market economy, adhere to the principle of 
fair tax burden and encouragement of competition, and meet the 
need to raise the "two proportions." In view of the fact that 
the circulation tax has traditionally been China's most 
important tax, in the near-term reform, it is both necessary and 
possible for us to set up a three-tax-two-regulation pattern 
comprising of the value-added tax as the primary tax and 
supplemented by the consumption tax and business tax. But in the 
longer time-span, as the classified tax system develops, we 
should strengthen the income tax and develop the resource tax. 
The change or development in the circulation tax is based on the 
rate of economic growth; income tax's development and change is 
based on economic efficiency. Income tax has a great future; 
many countries that practice the modern market economic system 
are relying primarily on the income tax. It is our opinion that 
it is quite likely that China will embark on this path in the 
future. 
  6. The issue of properly linking the old and the new 
systems. When the system changes tracks, it should "shift 
without confusion" and "change in an orderly fashion." 
Specifically, the central and local financial administrations 
and tax bureaus should work together to make meticulous 
preparations and keep in touch and pay attention to possible 
cracks and loopholes. They must vigorously encourage people to 
consider the whole situation, submit to the whole situation, do 
everything according to the law, banish the tendency to grab 
power and shirk responsibility, and to look beyond 
self-interests. We should guard against those who fiddle with 
the base numbers and artificially generate revenue surpluses or 
shortfalls, avoid paying unnecessary price in implementing the 
classified tax system, and maximize the positive effects while 
minimizing the negative effects, so as to ensure steady 
development of financial administration at all levels, striving 
for double bumper harvest in structural reform and financial 
administration.

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Keqian (0491 0344 6197) and Zhang Fengxi </F>
(1728 7685 0823): "Open Market Operations--A Major Reform of 
China's Central Bank Regulation and Control of the Money Supply"] 
  [Text] One of China's "major" monetary reforms in 1994 is 
the central bank's [PBC] practice of open market operations. 
The news coming from the gold-ingot-shaped PBC tower on 
Beijing's Fuxingmen confirms that: the central bank's 
management of monetary and credit funds in 1994 will change to 
mostly control of the money supply and oversight of financial 
institution operations, with its regulation and control of the 
money supply gradually introducing the international practice of 
open market operations. Authoritative figures claim that open 
market operations are a major reform of China's Central Bank 
style of macroeconomic regulation and control of the national 
economy, as well as a key market economy style of coordinating 
monetary and fiscal policies. 
  What are open market operations? They refer to actions by a 
country's central bank, through open market buying and selling 
of financial commodities, such as government bonds, to regulate 
money-market money supply and interest rates. When money 
market funds are tight, the Central Bank buys government 
securities on open markets, pouring basic currency into markets; 
when too much currency is in circulation on markets, the Central 
Bank sells government securities on open markets, withdrawing 
funds from circulation, to deflate the currency. 
<H5>  One of the "Magic Weapons" of Indirect Regulation and Control </H5>
  The three monetary policies of open market operations, 
rediscounting, and legal deposit reserves, are called in 
international monetary circles the "three key magic weapons" for 
exercising macroeconomic regulation and control of a national 
economy. In certain economically developed countries, open 
market operations are regularly used by the Central Bank to ease 
or tighten credit. 
  The reason that China did not take this step [practice open 
market operations] in the past, in addition to system factors, 
was that we had not yet met two objective terms: 
  1. The Central Bank has to hold sizeable amounts of 
government bonds, without which open market operations are mere 
empty talk. In certain developed countries, 50 to 60 percent 
of Central Bank assets are national treasury bonds, while in 
China, central fiscal deficits can be made up directly through 
PBC overdrafts, so that Central Bank assets do not include 
control of national treasury bonds. 
  2. There has to be a quite deep, broad, and flexible 
national treasury bond market. In such a market, commercial 
banks, stock companies, and other individuals and institutions 
all hold sizeable amounts of treasury bonds, and there is also a 
complete transaction system and standards. Otherwise, it is hard 
for the regulation of credit to have any impact. 
  So beginning in 1994, open market operations will take a 
developmental step, with central finance no longer directly 
overdrawing on and borrowing from the Central Bank, but rather 
selling treasury bonds to the public, to raise the needed 
national construction funds. In conjunction with these 
monetary and fiscal reform steps, the Central Bank will set 
percentage requirements for the liquid assets of financial 
institutions, stipulating that all types of financial 
institutions hold a set amount of treasury bonds and 
policy-finance bonds. Meanwhile, we will allow all commercial 
banks or their authorized branches, based on the minimum assets 
liquidity percentage set by the central bank, to buy and sell 
treasury bonds on secondary markets, or through forms, such as 
outside dealings, central bank collateral, and "buy-back 
agreements," to adjust the percentages of their own liquid 
reserve fund structures. 
  Based on this overall principle, we sold Central Bank 
financing bonds in 1993, and will expand treasury bond sales in 
1994 to 100 billion yuan, all of which bodes well for open 
market operations to reach a higher level. On 31 January 1994, 
our first batch of 15 billion yuan worth of treasury bills was 
completely underwritten by an exclusive sales group composed of 
35 financial institutions. The overall coordinator of this 
exclusive treasury bond sales group was the PBC. The joint 
sale of treasury bonds by the Ministry of Finance and the PBC 
was a historical first. It is understood that the Central Bank 
has recently begun to buy treasury bonds, beginning to practice 
open market operations, which will also be a historical first. 
  The operating tools of open market operations are treasury 
bonds and foreign exchange, with the ultimate aim being to 
stabilize the value of the RMB. Our choice of treasury bonds 
as our open market operating tool in 1994 will first: help us 
to draw on international practice to avoid detours and second; 
coordinate well fiscal and monetary policies through buying and 
selling treasury bonds. 
  The experts involved in the planning of this new monetary 
policy hold that the Central Bank use of open market operations 
to indirectly regulate and control the money supply will be 
like a trickling stream, which can effectively prevent the 
social and economic repercussions caused by the past forms of 
direct regulation and control, such as relending and 
controlling credit scope. This is because only when it is 
necessary to regulate and control the economy will the Central 
Bank handle basic currency through the three major channels of 
its discount collateral window, treasury bond market, and 
foreign exchange market, transmitting basic currency through 
these channels to financial institutions to produce the 
regulation and control effect, so that all financial 
institutions certainly do not deal directly with the central 
bank, but rather with money markets. Meanwhile, this policy 
will operate with constancy and continuity, in that once money 
markets experience changes, the Central Bank can quickly change 
its operating direction, to quickly adjust the market money 
supply. 
<H5>  Welcome News for Our Whole Society </H5>
  Central Bank initiation of open market operations is good 
news for financial institutions, as well as for enterprises and 
individuals. Ensuring that open market operations work to 
achieve the desired regulation and control impact will require 
the sale of large amounts of treasury bonds, which will sharply 
increase public investment opportunities. Banks and nonbank 
financial institutions can also, when funds are abundant or in 
short supply, directly or indirectly adjust their assets 
structures through treasury bond transactions with the Central 
Bank. As the Shenzhen Development Bank is a listed corporation, 
the relevant provisions do not allow it to invest in the stock 
market, so that for many years, treasury bonds have been a key 
part of its capital structure. Open market operations will 
undoubtedly provide fine opportunities for such institutions. 
A figure affiliated with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of 
China, which is acting as a major underwriter for the first 
batch of voluntary treasury bond sales, states that: "We 
particularly welcome the reform of treasury bond sales. Since 
many commercial bank assets are now credit loans, current 
lending seems to be a bottomless pit. But if we buy treasury 
bills, we can effectively change our former assets structure." 
  Central bank initiation of open market operations will also 
have a certain impact on current and future stock market prices 
and returns. For instance, when the PBC is buying large amounts 
of treasury bonds, this means that it is easing money and 
expanding credit, which will generally raise bond prices, 
lowering their yields. But when the PBC is selling large 
amounts of treasury bonds, this means that the central bank is 
tightening money and shrinking credit, creating the impression 
that interest rates will go up, thus lowering demand for 
investment bonds, causing bond prices to slide. For the 
investor, correctly grasping these "signals" for timely 
purchases or sales of treasury bonds, will sharply increase 
investment returns. 
<H5>  Open Market Operations Are a Heavy Responsibility </H5>
  Central Bank open market operations are intertwined and 
mutually promotional with treasury bond markets. 
  China's treasury bond circulation is less than ideal, one of 
the signs of which is a low turnover rate. For U.S. treasury 
bond sales, the turnover rate can reach 100 percent in about one 
week, while the turnover rate for China's treasury bonds was 
less than 100 percent for all of 1993. We are facing a similar 
problem in 1994. The Shanghai Stock Exchange offers a series of 
treasury bond services, such as buybacks, futures, and spots, 
for which trading volume and turnover rates are all low, with 
almost noone using its treasury bond buyback service for capital 
financing. In other words, China's open market operations still 
depend on the size and vigor of the secondary bond market, as 
well as on related central bank steps, without which their 
initiation will be negatively affected. 
  In another area, China's open market operations are just 
beginning in 1994, with few possible means of regulation and 
control, meaning that for some time to come, it will be 
impossible for them to become the Central Bank's major means of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and that it will be hard 
for them to have much impact on macroeconomic conditions. It 
is predictable that as the Central Bank's monetary policy tools 
increase, and its regulation and control means improve, it will 
not be too long before indirect means of regulation and control, 
such as open market operations, will play the key economic 
regulation role, to replace direct means of regulation and 
control.

Ts'e Investigation and Research Co., Ltd.: "Prospects of the 
Financial Reform in Mainland China"] 
  [Text] Since early 1994, the Chinese Government has adopted 
an ever more cautious attitude in its pursuit of the financial 
reform. The present article summarizes a thorough research into 
the financial reform in Mainland China, carried out since the 
end of last year by the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will 
assist readers in getting to know and fully understand the 
  financial reform on the mainland. 
  Following the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, and having set the establishment of the socialist 
market economy system as general objective, the Chinese 
Government formulated a series of reform plans. One of their 
most important components is the reform of the financial system. 
The following major items are included in the scheduled 
financial reform plan: The People's Bank is to become a Central 
Bank; commercial finance is to be separated from the state's 
policy-directed finance; the present specialized banks shall be 
converted into commercial banks, and appropriate banks shall be 
established for the state's policy-directed finance; various 
kinds of financial institutions of a nonbank character and 
securities markets shall be developed; banks with new and 
different ownership systems shall be established; the financial 
markets shall be gradually and to a limited extent opened to the 
outside world. 
  These reform plans of the Chinese Government have attracted 
general attention in Chinese as well as foreign financial 
circles, and have raised great hopes of financial reform in 
1994. Contrary to this optimistic anticipation, the Chinese 
Government, since the beginning of 1994, has been adopting an 
ever more cautious attitude toward financial reform. The present 
article summarizes the thorough research of financial reform in 
Mainland China carried out since the second half of last year by 
the Chih Ts'e Company. We hope it will assist readers in getting 
to know and fully understand the financial reform on the 
mainland. 
  Two Kinds of Interests, Two Kinds of Objectives 
  One of the major special characteristics in the 15-year 
history of the reform has been that implementation of whichever 
item of mainland reform has always been the result of continuous 
back-and-forth adjustments and negotiations between the central 
government and the local governments. Not one item of the reform 
has been implemented according to the predetermined plan and 
timetable of the central government. The financial reform will 
reflect this basic characteristic even more intensely. 
  As far as the central government is concerned, its 
fundamental objective in the financial reform is establishment 
of a new system of macroregulation and control, suited to the 
conditions of market economy, to replace the former 
administrative method and to realize the developmental 
objectives of the central government. In the immediate future 
and for a medium range of time, the policy of strengthening 
macroregulation and control actually means strengthening the 
central government's control of the economy and reducing the 
ability of local governments to interfere. The central 
government is particularly interested in having the People's 
Bank as quickly as possible assume the various functions of a 
central bank and to have it designated as policy-setting bank. 
Converting the specialized banks into commercial banks is being 
viewed as even more important, in that it will enable the branch 
agencies of specialized banks to free themselves of the 
influences exerted by local governments and to raise the 
efficiency of their credits, and, furthermore, to be able to 
continue maintaining control over the scope of credits. 
  As far as the local governments are concerned, the 
fundamental objective of the financial reform is to reduce as 
far as possible the central government's financial control in 
one's territory, to increase sources of funds for one's 
locality, and to provide for all local enterprises and for local 
economic development a financial environment that is less 
exposed to influences emanating from the economic condition of 
the overall entity. The local governments will therefore attach 
greater importance to the development of all kinds of direct 
methods of financing and of banking institutions of a local 
nature, including the development of local banks. They also hope 
that it will be possible in the course of the commercialization 
of the specialized banks to gain greater freedom from the 
central authorities' centralized control and restraints on 
their, the local governments', scale of operations. 
  No doubt, these two reform objectives do not agree with each 
other, and that reveals a very serious contradiction. This 
disparity is bound to constitute a substantial impediment in the 
financial reform and in the commercialization of the specialized 
banks. 
  Fundamental Obstructions Impeding Financial Reform 
  The financial reform on the mainland is up against three 
most 
fundamental obstructions: 
  1) The enterprise system. The most basic 
characteristic of mainland enterprises, whether they are 
state-run or collective-run, is that they take responsibility 
for profits but not for losses. As long as they have attained a 
certain proportion and employ a certain number of staff and 
workers, enterprises under most circumstances simply cannot go 
bankrupt and cannot be closed down. To a very large extent this 
is due to the fact that mainland enterprises also function to a 
very large part as a social security system. Once an enterprise 
would go bankrupt, workers would lose their jobs, and this would 
endanger social stability. Neither the central government nor 
the local governments will wish this to happen. Under these 
circumstances, the enterprise-bank relationship cannot possibly 
be a completely economic relationship, banks also cannot 
possibly grant loans completely according to economic 
principles, and it is then also quite impossible for banks to 
enforce repayment of loans when enterprises find themselves 
unable to repay bank loans. In most instances nowadays, banks 
will grant credits to enterprises that incur serious losses or 
whose assets do not cover their liabilities just to have them 
keep up production or to ensure by their loans that the workers 
will be paid their basic wages. What has to be emphasized here 
is that in any case the reform of the enterprise system will be 
a very slow and gradual process. Before having truly established 
an enterprise bankruptcy system and a social security system, 
and before these systems are really functional, no great 
progress is possible in the commercialization of the specialized 
banks on the mainland. 
  2) Macro-economic control. After the very thorough 
reform of the planning system, finance, especially the system of 
specialized banks, has at the present stage become the central 
government's major means of exercising macroeconomic control and 
the major means of realizing the objectives of its industrial 
policy. Prior to having established a new form of macroeconomic 
regulation and control, the commercialization of the specialized 
banks would soon result in detaching these banks from the 
economic interests of the central government and allowing them 
to adopt an attitude of noncompliance with state policy, where 
such conflicts with the banks' own interests. This would 
undoubtedly weaken the ability of the central government to 
control economic activities. Even if, as a matter of priority, 
special banks are established for the state's policy-directed 
financial affairs, having all credit business operated along 
commercial principles would then still make it impossible for 
the central government to realize a large part of its 
macroeconomic policy objectives, because the credit operations 
of the specialized banks would be of so large a scale as to be 
decisive within the total amount of credit operations. This 
would apply to the areas of controlling the overall scope of 
credits, the direction of credit investments, assurance of 
employment, etc. For these reasons, the central government is 
adopting a most cautious stand in the question of 
commercialization of the specialized banks. 
  3) Local interests. For a variety of reasons, 
setting up branch agencies of the specialized banks all over the 
country would make these branches, to a certain extent, banks of 
the local governments. To achieve their local economic 
objectives, the local governments would use every means to have 
the specialized banks grant credits according to their, the 
local governments', demands. If the basic-level bank branches 
would not be able to freely decide on the granting of loans, it 
would hardly be possible for any real commercialization to be 
truly materialized. It has to be emphasized, therefore, that 
even if it would be possible to keep organizational and staff 
matters free from the influence of the local governments, the 
local branches would, in all their business operations, still be 
subject to the dispositions and directions of the local 
governments. 
  The significance of the above-stated three difficulties is 
perhaps: Apart from the experts, there is nobody in Mainland 
China who truly hopes for an early commercialization of the 
specialized banks. 
  A Reform Characterized by Peripheral Reforms 
  The central government is fully aware of the complexity of 
such problems as the commercialization of the specialized banks 
and the overall reform of the financial system. It is, 
therefore, adopting a very cautious attitude toward these 
reforms. Even though the "Resolution of the Third Plenary 
Session" and related documents emphasize the importance of 
financial reform and the commercialization of the specialized 
banks, in actual implementation greater importance is placed on 
stability and feasibility of the reform process. Key points in 
the reform for the immediate and medium-range future are to 
strengthen, as a matter or priority, the functions of the 
Central Bank and the establishment of banks for the state's 
policy-directed financial affairs, so as to achieve the 
separation of ordinary finance from the state's policy-directed 
finance. In matters of commercialization of the specialized 
banks, the stand taken is one of steadiness and soundness. Early 
this year, at the All-China Financial Work Conference, the 
presidents of the four specialized banks did not emphasize 
commercialization as a key task, but merely mentioned, in 
general terms, the intention to advance in that direction. 
Thereafter, the complexity of the entire macroeconomic situation 
and the increasing pressure of the commodity price increases, 
had the central government and the relevant agencies become even 
more cautious in the matter of promoting financial reforms. 
  In reviewing the past experiences in the reform, we believe 
the financial reform and commercialization of the specialized 
banks will possibly show more or less the following 
characteristic developments: 
  1) In overall progress and dispositions, matters will 
on the whole follow the basic course of past reform activities 
on the mainland. At first, a relevant reform plan will be 
formulated, and an appropriate locality will then be selected 
where the project will be launched as an experiment on a small 
scale to gain necessary experiences. On the basis of the 
collective experiences, the project will then be gradually 
expanded. Completion of the relevant reform plan could be 
expected within a year. 
  2) As to its specific forms, the reform may be 
conducted in a variety of forms in parallel. In the area of 
securities markets (securities to comprise stocks and bonds), as 
to non-bank financial institutions, as to the commercialization 
of specialized banks, as to various forms of local banks, as to 
banks on the shareholding cooperative system, as to the limited 
opening up of the domestic financial market and of business in 
people's currency [RMB], experiments in various forms will be 
conducted simultaneously. 
  3) Stimulating the process of commercialization of the 
specialized banks by other types of financial reforms. This 
comprises two basic aspects: First, most speedy development and 
promotion of various forms of direct financing. Second, most 
speedy development of banks other than the specialized banks. 
  Because every type of direct financing and banks other than 
the specialized banks are much closer to the development of the 
regional economy, and are much easier influenced by local 
governments, these financial activities and reforms will receive 
much more support from the local governments. We may therefore 
see in the coming few years a rapid development of these 
financial reforms, and there will also be a substantial impetus 
from the basic level toward the upper levels in the core concern 
of the financial reform, namely in the commercialization of the 
specialized banks. 
  Opportunities Brought by the Financial Reform 
  As far as foreign investors are concerned, the financial 
reform in Mainland China, regardless of its speed, will provide 
a series of new investment opportunities, and will also be of 
assistance to foreign investments already in place on the 
mainland. Speaking only of the reforms that have already taken 
place, these opportunities exist on the whole in the following 
areas: 
  1) Foreign-Financed Banks. At present, the Chinese 
Government already allows foreign capital to set up fully or 
partly foreign-financed banks in the special economic zones 
[SEZs]. In Shanghai, there are already over 80 foreign-financed 
banks and financial institutions, and such also exist in other 
SEZs. 
  2)Opening up trade in RMB. At present, Shanghai 
has already decided to open up, tentatively and within limits, 
trade in RMB to foreign financial institutions within the year. 
With this as starting point, all SEZs will gradually engage in 
similar experiments. Even though this type of business activity 
is restricted to the SEZs, the fact that each SEZ has the 
position of financial center will have the effect that these 
experiments will have widespread influence and will penetrate 
into the other areas of Mainland China. 
  3)Non-Bank Financial Institutions 
  Chinese Government regulations on foreign capital entering 
into securities and funds are very relaxed. In the next few 
years, these areas will experience very rapid development. At 
present, as many as 600 funds of various types are awaiting 
approval. After the People's Bank will have promulgated its 
regulations on the administration of funds, mainland funds will 
develop very rapidly. 
  Overall, the fact that financial reform and financial 
activities on the mainland are drawing closer to international 
practices will induce the government to gradually relax 
financial controls. It will, furthermore, adopt a series of new 
forms of financial activities and provide new opportunities for 
financial investments, and foreign investors will gain much 
benefit in the course of these developments.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhou Shaoping (0419 1421 1627): "GATT Accession </F>
Prospects Still Unclear"] 
  [Text] It has been eight years since China submitted its 
application to GATT for the resumption of its membership in July 
1986. During these eight years, GATT's China working group, 
charged with reviewing and considering China's application, has 
held 16 conferences and posed thousands of questions concerning 
all aspects of China's trade system to the Chinese delegation. 
This marathon-style review progress is rare in GATT history. 
The working group held its 16th meeting in Geneva between 15 
and 18 March but clear progress remains elusive. 
  Under the accord reached by the 110 nations participating in 
the Uruguay Round, a World Trade Organization [WTO] will be set 
up to replace GATT. In principle WTO is scheduled to be set up 
before July 1995. However, most nations now want to advance the 
date to January 1995. This development has given GATT accession 
negotiations extra urgency. To be a founding member of WTO, 
China must totally wrap up GATT accession talks by fall this 
year. Otherwise it will have to apply anew on even more 
stringent terms. Thus it can be said with certainty the next few 
months will be a critical period in China's push for GATT 
membership. 
  The GATT China working group is responsible for all work 
relating to the resumption of China's status as a signatory to 
GATT. Its responsibilities can be divided into three parts: 
examining and reviewing China's foreign trade system; drafting 
the GATT accession agreement, including provisions on China's 
rights and obligations after it becomes a member; and tariff 
reduction negotiations between China and other GATT signatories. 
For a variety of reasons, the working group has always focused 
its energies on scrutinizing China's trade system. 
  Both during the working group's 16th meeting and when he met 
with Director-General Sutherland of GATT, Gu Yongjiang, vice 
minister of foreign economic relations and trade who headed 
China's delegation to the negotiations, emphasized that China 
has met the conditions for admission and that the working group 
should speed up the negotiation process by wrapping up its 
consideration of China's trade system and starting to draft the 
admission agreement. Sutherland expressed his support for 
China's early accession, noting that without China, the future 
WTO would lack broad representativeness. 
  To nudge the negotiation process along, the Chinese 
Government has introduced a string of foreign trade reforms in a 
concerted effort to create a new mechanism compatible with the 
rules by which the international trade system operates. Since 
the end of last year, in particular, it has unveiled several 
major reforms such as abolishing the mandatory import plan, 
reforming the import quota and import permit system, drastically 
narrowing the scope of import management, simplifying import 
procedures, and quickening the pace of tariff cuts. In 1992 it 
eliminated the import regulating tax and lowered the import tax 
twice. On top of that it lowered the tax rates on more than 280 
commodities and did away with quota and permit management for 
the 280 commodities last year. These steps have opened the 
Chinese market even further. At the 16th meeting, the Chinese 
delegate made additional commitments on the issue of tariff and 
non-tariff reductions and concessions. This year, moreover, 
China has taken steps to reform its foreign exchange system and 
tax system. Under its original commitment to GATT, China was to 
reform its foreign exchange system within five years. As it 
turned out, it took China less than one year to do just that. 
  Delegates from all nations who attended the China working 
group's 16th meeting welcomed China's reform measures. With the 
exception of the United States, all developed nations said 
unequivocally that the working group should speed up its 
deliberations and begin formal negotiations on China's GATT 
accession agreement as soon as possible so that China can rejoin 
GATT before WTO is established. During a visit to China last 
February, Bulitan, the EC delegate, presented China with a draft 
agreement, which was viewed by Chinese trade officials as a 
positive move that would prod the negotiation process forward. 
At the 16th meeting, the Chinese delegate and his EC 
counterpart exchanged ideas on the draft. The Japanese delegate 
indicated that Japan would open negotiations with China on 
tariff reductions. As of to date about 10 countries, including 
Australia and New Zealand, have opened negotiations with China 
on bilateral tariff reduction. 
  With all these nations working hard to accelerate GATT 
accession negotiation, America's isolation becomes even more 
pronounced. The negative attitude of the United States to the 
resumption of China's GATT membership contrasted sharply with 
the atmosphere at the meeting. The U.S. delegate said the 
agreement should not be discussed before they figure out China's 
trade system and objected to China's accession "timetable." 
During bilateral Sino-U.S. contacts, the Americans invariably 
voice strong support for Chinese GATT membership. It is hard to 
tell what the Americans are up to. Within the United States 
there are some people who argue that Clinton's foreign policy, 
including of course his China policy, has yet to take shape. 
  Whether or not China can rejoin GATT on schedule depends to 
a 
large extent on America's attitude. Observers say there are 
only two possible scenarios. In one scenario, the United States 
drives a hard bargain only to relent at the last moment. The 
other scenario depicts the United States as utterly determined 
to prevent China from becoming a founding member of the future 
WTO. Whichever scenario materializes, it is an irreversible 
trend for the Chinese economy to flourish and for China to take 
bold strides to join the world.

State Council Development Studies Center; edited by Luo Guifen 
(5012 2710 5358): "China's Income Distribution: Status Quo and 
Policy Analysis"] 
  [Excerpts] 
<H5>  II. The Urban-Rural Income-Distribution Gap </H5>
  Rural residents and city dwellers are two major interest 
groups with different features in Chinese society. As these two 
groups have completely different distribution mechanisms, as 
well as quite differing distribution orders, clarifying our 
urban-rural income-gap status quo and analyzing the factors 
producing the gap, is of key significance in understanding 
China's overall income distribution. 
  When our traditional system had just begun to be perfected 
in 
1957, the average income of China's city dwellers was 3.48 times 
that of rural residents, which figure had basically stabilized 
by pre-cultural revolution 1964 at about 2.38 times, where it 
stayed until 1979. But as reform and opening up occurred first 
in the rural areas, steadily raising agricultural labor 
productivity, our urban-rural income-distribution gap has shrunk 
yearly since 1979. By the mid-1980s, our urban-rural 
income-distribution gap has dropped below 1.9. And while it 
rose only slightly afterwards, it had clearly increased to 2.31 
by 1989 and 2.42 by 1990, surpassing even that of 1978. The 
clear growth of this urban-rural gap has aroused widespread 
public concern. 
  The phased change in this urban-rural income gap was the 
inevitable outcome of the phased advance of reform and opening 
and the phased adjustment of our economic policy. Of the 
factors causing the change in our urban-rural 
income-distribution order, prices were one of the most direct 
ones. In 1979, when the state raised the procurement prices for 
18 categories of farm and sideline products, the composite 
comparative price index for industrial and agricultural 
commodities dropped to 82 percent. Peasant income went up 19.4 
percent from 1978. In the following years, prices were 
deregulated yearly, with the excess-purchase markup percentage 
rising steadily. 
  From 1979 through 1981, the percentages of the price factor 
in overall peasant income growth were respectively 4.1 percent, 
18.1 percent, and 18.8 percent. By 1989, the composite 
comparative price index for industrial and agricultural 
commodities had shot up from 1988's 93.7 percent to 103.2 
percent, reaching 107.4 percent by 1990, with the urban-rural 
income-distribution gap growing respectively to 2.31 and 2.42. 
In addition, the responsibility system of linking remuneration 
to output in the rural areas that was first tested in 1979 and 
then gradually expanded and fully implemented from 1982 to 1984, 
along with the basic change in the rural organizational 
structure, sharply aroused peasant production initiative. 
During that time, peasant households had land-use rights, 
acquiring independent property rights, directive planning and 
administrative control of production was abolished in rural 
areas, a commodity economy steadily developed, markets gradually 
formed, and the enormous energies released by system reform 
combined with the state's 3-decade post-liberation investment in 
agricultural, fixed assets and infrastructures to sharply raise 
agricultural labor productivity. 
  Our agricultural growth rates from 1981 through 1984 were 
respectively 5.8 percent, 11.3 percent, 7.8 percent, and 12.3 
percent, approaching and exceeding our GNP growth rates. During 
this period, our urban economic-system reform had just begun, 
with distribution-system changes reflected only in areas, such 
as the raising of wages step by step and the restoration of the 
bonus system, while all manufactured goods and service prices 
remained mostly under directive-plan control. So in this phase, 
our urban-rural income gap dropped to a historic low. But the 
"CPC Central Committee Resolution on Economic-System Reform" 
passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC Central 
Committee showed that our reform priority had shifted from the 
rural areas to cities. After this, urban economic reform 
advanced quickly, with enterprises acquiring increasing 
independent operating authority and planned management steadily 
shrinking in scope. The dual-track pricing system, with bonus 
maximums no longer set, and the various forms of the 
responsibility system practiced after 1988, clearly slanted our 
profit-distribution order toward the cities, with the 
urban-rural income gap growing again to its 1987 level of 2.19. 
  It needs to be pointed out that while the comparative 
profits 
of [agricultural] cultivation began to drop in this stage, the 
large shift of the rural surplus workforce to nonfarm industry, 
with the rapid rise of all types of village and township run 
enterprises, clearly raised the percentage of non-farm income in 
peasant net income to a certain extent keeping the urban-rural 
income gap at a fairly reasonable level. But the 1989 
improvement and rectification sharply cut back the growth of 
township and village enterprises, slowing the growth rate of 
rural nonfarm industry. Over 30 million peasants who had left 
the soil but not the countryside lost their jobs in nonfarm 
industry, returning to traditional agriculture, which had 
worsened by 1990. In peasant per capita net income, the 
percentage of nonfarm income dropped to 26.53 percent. Still in 
the period of improvement and rectification, due to the basic 
difference in urban and rural distribution mechanisms, while the 
1990 nonfarm industry growth rates were 5.5 percent for 
industry, 3 percent for communications and transportation, -6.9 
percent for commerce, and zero growth for construction, the 
agricultural growth rate was a high 7.5 percent. But the 
peasant net income growth rate was only 4.7 percent, with the 
nonfarm employee wage growth rate reaching a high 12.7 percent, 
and the urban and rural household average cost of living income 
up 10 percent. 
  The above analysis involves only the overt urban-rural 
income 
gap and its causes. But a covert urban-rural income gap was 
also very evident. First, urban housing was generally assigned 
by the [work] unit and the state, at very low rents; health care 
costs were also borne by the state and collectives, with 
everyone receiving pensions after retirement. After 1984, 
city-dweller subsidies clearly increased. A sampling and 
projection by a CASS Economic Institute income-distribution 
taskforce shows that if all types of subsidies are included, our 
1988 urban-rural income gap was 2.36, higher than the 2.91 
result obtained from overt-income calculations. 
  In short, China's urban-rural income gap is one of the most 
glaring yet easily overlooked problems in the field of 
distribution. This gap was formed by both system factors and 
policy impacts. But while acknowledging our urban-rural 
distribution gap, we also need to note that since reform and 
opening, our overall urban-rural distribution trend has been 
toward improvement and rationalization. From 1952 to 1978, our 
rural income growth rate was 1.95 percent, while our urban 
income growth rate was 3.15 percent, meaning that urban incomes 
grew faster than rural ones. But from 1978 to 1990, rural 
incomes averaged growth of 6.37 percent, while urban incomes 
averaged growth of only 5.08 percent, meaning that rural incomes 
grew faster than urban ones. So as to accumulated effect and 
overall trend, reform and opening have still improved our 
urban-rural income distribution. As to the phased results, 
whenever reform and opening were proceeding more smoothly, our 
urban-rural income-distribution gap was more rational, and vice 
versa. This shows that it is only by persisting in reform and 
opening that we can perfect our socialist distribution system, 
to speed up the growth of our productive forces. 
<H5>  III. The Regional Income-Distribution Gap </H5>
  As China is vast in territory, with sharp differences in 
natural and geographic conditions, and very uneven economic 
development, our income-distribution gap among provinces is 
quite obvious. 
  In our initial reform and opening period in 1980, net 
peasant 
income throughout China averaged 204.89 yuan, with 10 provinces 
and municipalities having incomes higher than the average, and 
the highest incomes being in Shanghai, where they averaged 
397.35 yuan a year. There were 18 provinces and municipalities 
with incomes lower then the average, with the lowest incomes 
being in Shaanxi, where net income averaged 142.49 yuan a year. 
Shanghai incomes were 2.78 times those of Shaanxi, with the 
high-income group of provinces and municipalities concentrated 
in the agriculturally-developed three eastern provinces, 
Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the three 
municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai). The 
income-distribution inequality index W (Elteto-Frigyes) was 
42.96 percent for all provinces, with the inequality index U for 
the provinces and municipalities below the average income being 
23.19 percent, and the inequality index V for the provinces and 
municipalities above the average income at 25.73 percent. 
Beginning in 1980, the degree of income-distribution inequality 
among provinces rose steadily. By 1990, the highest incomes 
were in Shanghai Municipality, where net incomes averaged 
1,664.35 yuan a year, while the lowest ones were in Gansu 
Province, where net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, making 
Shanghai incomes 4.7 times that of Gansu's. By 1990, the W 
index had risen to 46.74 percent, about 4 points higher than in 
1980, while the U and V indexes had climbed respectively to 
26.32 percent and 32.72 percent, both more than 10 points higher 
than in 1980. 
  During this decade, the larger regional income-gap was 
characterized mainly by a larger gap between income from the 
collective economy and other nonproduction income, with the W 
indexes for these two categories of income respectively at 93 
percent and 60.54 percent, far larger than the inequality index 
for peasant net income. The household-operation income index W 
was 27.92 percent, lower than the overall gap: this included the 
V index for provinces and municipalities above the average 
income at only 9.6 percent, and the U index for those below the 
average which was at 20.2 percent. It is thus obvious that the 
gap between developed and undeveloped provinces in 
household-operation income where the key source is traditional 
cultivation income, was certainly not the major source of the 
peasant income gap. 
  In contrast to the peasant income gap, urban-household 
income 
inequality among provinces was much less. In 1990, the 
inequality index W was 30 percent for the lowest income group 
among provinces, and 28 percent for the highest income group, 
but only about 25 percent for the middle-income group. It is 
thus obvious that the urban income gap was most glaring among 
the lowest and highest income levels. In the provinces and 
municipalities with incomes above the average, inequality was 
lowest for the middle-income group, with the V index at only 
10.7 percent, while in the provinces and municipalities with 
incomes below the average, inequality was lower for the 
high-income group, with the inequality index U at about 12 
percent. So urban income-distribution equalitarianism remains 
quite evident. 
  In urban household income, the gap among average employee 
wages in all provinces and municipalties was also not too large. 
In 1981, annual employee incomes were highest in Tibet and 
Qinghai, and lowest in Jiangsu, with the national employee-wage 
inequality index W at 16.37. There were 17 provinces and 
municipalities below the average, with the U index at 7.49 
percent, and 12 above the average, with the V index at 9.6 
percent and except for the three municipalities, most of the 
rest being minority nationality and border regions. The major 
source of the wage difference was the regional difference 
between the highland and border regions. From 1981 to 1986, the 
inequality indexes climbed yearly, reaching their maximums by 
1986, when the U, V and W indexes were respectively 14.06 
percent, 21.08 percent, and 32.19 percent higher than in 1981 by 
7, 12, and 16 points, respectively. But after 1986, the 
employee-wage inequality index fell yearly, with the U, V and W 
indexes by 1990 down respectively to 10.65 percent, 16.71 
percent, and 25.51 percent. In 1990, average yearly wages were 
3,178 yuan for the highest-income Tibet, and 1,729 yuan for the 
lowest-income Jiangxi. Generally, average wages were relatively 
higher for economically more developed regions and mostly lower 
for undeveloped ones, except for border regions. Among all 
provinces and municipalities, distribution inequality was 
greater for those with wages above the national average than for 
those with incomes below the national average. That the 
employee-wage income gap first grew and then shrank was closely 
related to wage-reform progress in the 1980s. Before 1985, wage 
reform was basically a resumption of certain effective 
pre-cultural revolution bonus systems, with adoption of methods, 
such as additional wages for all employees in batches. But the 
1985 enterprise and institutional wage reform actually 
reinforced the equalitarian-distribution method. 
  The causes of the income-distribution gap among provinces 
were as follows: The production-factor structure. In 
eastern China, education had long been more advanced, with the 
percentages of illiteracy and semiliteracy among those over 15 
years of age lower than the national average, while in western 
China, these percentages were higher than the national average. 
The percentage of those older than 6 with higher than junior 
high school educations was higher in the east than in the west. 
This literacy discrepancy directly affected workforce quality, 
even more so in its market-economy concepts. Generally, most 
poorly-educated workers had information problems and no way to 
get rich, being unable to quickly master new technology and 
diversified economic means, they were only able to engage in 
traditional, inefficient work. But regions and groups where 
educational quality was higher were able to adapt to 
market-economy laws. Based on their own advantages, while 
engaging in traditional agriculture, they shifted surplus labor 
and surplus worktime to nonfarm industry, with urban employees 
taking up second occupations and other ways to get rich. As the 
impact of this education gap on income distribution was 
potential and longstanding, it was very hard to change quickly 
in a short period of time. 
  As to natural and geographic conditions, the east was far 
more advantaged than the west. Superior natural and geographic 
conditions contributed to agricultural development, thus 
supporting light industry growth, to bring along the economic 
development of the whole region. In addition, eastern China had 
far superior transportation facilities, information channels and 
investment climates than western and central China, enabling it 
to attract an inflow of talent, money, and technology from other 
parts of China and abroad. Starting in the Sixth Five-Year 
Plan, the state increased its investment in the eastern coastal 
zone, pushing this region's percentage of national investment to 
50.6 percent, far exceeding its 1953-1980 level of 40.6 percent. 
During the whole 1980s, state investment in the eastern zone 
and this region's own investment growth rate both far exceeded 
that for western and central China, enabling the eastern region 
to combine its human capital, funding, and geographic advantages 
to quickly raise its production level, promoting its economic 
takeoff, and speeding up its economic growth rate. The 
economic-development gap was the main cause of the 
income-distribution gap among eastern, central, and western 
China, as well as that between the coastal and interior zones. 
  The most obvious feature of the regional income-distribution 
gap as shown in development level was the makeup of the rural 
industrial structure. As China has such a large population, 
whether rural surplus labor can shift from traditional 
agriculture to nonfarm industry, and the rate and scale of this 
shift, largely determine a region's economic development and 
income levels. Eastern China's ratio of GVAO to GNP is only 
about 37 percent, while central and western China's are 
respectively 55 percent and approximately 65 percent. 
Conversely, eastern China's ratio of rural GVIO to GNP is about 
50 percent, far exceeding the output value of traditional 
agriculture, while central and western China's are respectively 
only 29.3 percent and 22.3 percent. In 1989, in Jiangsu with a 
higher level of rural industrial development, the ratio of 
traditional-agricultural gross output value to GVAO was only 
27.9 percent, which figure for Guizhou was 75.45 percent. This 
huge difference in rural industrial structure obviously affects 
the regional income-distribution makeup. 
  In the regional distribution gap, in addition to the impact 
of the productive-forces gap, state macroeconomic policy was 
also a very important factor. Since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the state has adopted an 
uneven-development regional policy, employing a laddered 
development strategy of SEZs--open coastal cities--coastal 
EDZs--open cities along the Chang Jiang and open border 
zones--interior, to drive overall economic development. The 
coastal zones that were opened first enjoyed more autonomy and 
more preferential policies than the interior areas, such as 
investment-project examination and approval, foreign-investment 
attraction, foreign trade, foreign-exchange retention, loan 
scale, and tax burden. These policy preferences on one hand 
attracted a steady inflow of overseas advanced equipment, 
technology, and funding and domestic outstanding talent and 
economic resources, enabling these zones to steadily upgrade 
their industrial structures and quickly develop their 
manufacturing industries. On the other hand, they enabled these 
zones to use a slanted price structure of lower prices for 
domestic primary products, resource products, raw materials, and 
energy and higher ones for finished goods, to benefit in the 
exchange of products with the interior, enhancing their 
accumulated might, and forming market and profit structures more 
favorable to the eastern region. 
  The eastern region's faster investment and steady expansion 
of domestic and foreign markets clearly raised its employment 
rate, changing its workforce's job structure, and raising its 
overall income level. As to the distribution-policy effect, the 
zones that were opened first with a faster reform pace were the 
first to break free from the iron-ricebowl and big-pottist (all 
eating out of one big pot) distribution system, to establish 
efficiency-oriented incentive forces, in which incomes were 
closely linked to work done and efficiency produced. While 
raising overall incomes, they also widened income grades, 
stimulating the initiative of their whole workforce. In short, 
China's regional income gap was caused by the development gap 
and macroeconomic policy differences. 
<H5>  IV. The Income-Distribution Gap by Ownership System and </H5>
Industry 
  Since 1978, China has encouraged the suitable development of 
its non-state economy, bringing marked change to the purely 
state-owned economic structure under the traditional system. In 
urban employment, employment figures for the collective and 
other non-state economies climbed respectively from 1978's 21.52 
percent and 0.16 percent to 23.54 percent and 5.67 percent by 
1990. In GVIO, collective-enterprise output value rose to 35 
percent, with output value for nonstate economic components, 
such as individual, private, and "the three kinds of foreign 
trade" enterprises, up from 0.7 percent to 10 percent. By the 
end of 1991, the number of household operations throughout China 
had grown to 14.168 million, employing 22.58 million, with 
registered capital of 48.82 billion yuan; there were 108,000 
private enterprises, employing 1.839 million, with registered 
capital of 12.32 billion yuan. So while generally speaking, the 
public economy remains China's dominant one, an order of the 
coexistence and development of the diversified economy has 
essentially evolved. This change in the ownership order has 
resulted in a changed income-distribution structure. We will 
now describe our income-distribution status quo and features by 
ownership system and industry. 
  China's income distribution by ownership system is 
characterized as follows: 1. Average incomes are higher for 
employees in state enterprises than in collective ones. The 
general scope of this is over 23 percent, with the difference 
being fairly stable at 31 percent at its highest in 1979, and at 
23 percent at its lowest in 1983, 1984, and 1987. The 
difference in the average annual wage growth rates for employees 
under state and collective ownership is almost nil. 2. Average 
wages are higher for employees in nonstate enterprises than in 
state enterprises. At their highest point in 1990, average 
wages for employees in nonstate enterprises were respectively 
2.232 and 1.77 times those in collective and state enterprises, 
with the absolute value being over 1,700 yuan more. And the 
employee-wage growth rate is also 14.2 percent higher for 
nonstate than state enterprises. 3. The employee income gap 
between state and collective enterprises widens during times of 
economic retrenchment, shrinking during periods of economic 
expansion. From 1983 to 1985, our economy grew very quickly, 
with the wage gap between employees in state and collective 
enterprises dropping to about 23 percent; in 1986 when our 
economic growth rate fell, this gap rose to 27 percent. In 1987 
and 1988 our economic growth rate accelerated, shrinking the gap 
to 23 percent. But in 1989, with economic recession and soft 
markets, the gap grew again to 32.8 percent. 
  The income-distribution gap among various Chinese industries 
was smaller. As to the national average, the wage-growth rate 
from 1978 to 1990 basically did not differ much, with that of 
the fastest-growing industries, such as culture, education, and 
public health, only 1.7 points higher than that of the 
slowest-growing ones, such as commerce and catering services. 
The wage-gap inequality index among industries remained at 
about 10 percent for most years, as well as showing no yearly 
growth momentum. Comparing the initial reform and opening 
period to the most recent years, the U index among the 
lower-income sectors also did not grow. And while the V index 
among the higher-income sectors grew somewhat after 1985, its 
growth was not serious. The income-distribution gap among 
sectors by ownership system was larger for state than collective 
ownership, and larger for other forms of ownership than for 
state ownership, which completely tallies with the mass of 
calculation results. 
  Within state-owned industries, the inequality indexes were 
lowest for 1982 and 1983 at respectively 7.53 percent and 8.01 
percent, and highest for 1979 and 1989 at respectively 9.58 
percent and 9.33 percent. The U index among the lower-income 
sectors was clearly lower than the V index among the 
higher-income sectors, showing that the income gap was smaller 
for the low-income sector than for the high-income one. The 
overall-model W index rose more obviously in 1989 and 1990. 
Within collectively owned industries, the inequality indexes 
for 1979 to 1983 were higher than for the years afer 1983. This 
shows that the distribution-equalitarianism tendency among 
collective industries was more serious after 1983. In addition, 
for collective ownership, the U index within low-income 
industries was higher than the V index within high-income ones, 
showing that the inequality was greater within low-income 
industries than high-income ones. This was precisely the 
opposite of the case for state industry. Among industries of 
other forms of ownership, the income-distribution inequality 
indexes U, V, and W were all higher than for state and 
collective ownership. Their variation coefficient VC was 
highest in 1985 at 31 percent and lowest in 1989 at 17 percent. 
It needs to be pointed out that for the distribution gap among 
industries as used here, since industrial concentration was 
greater, the results derived from calculations of average level 
might differ from those by particular industry. But due to 
data-validity problems, we were unable in this article to make a 
more detailed division or more thorough exploration. 
  The abovementioned income-distribution features among 
various 
Chinese ownership systems had profound system settings. 1) 
Enterprises of varying forms of ownership had differing capital 
sources. The investment sources of state enterprises had long 
been direct appropriations from state revenue. Even once the 
investment system was reformed, by 1990, state-budgeted 
investment still made up 13.2 percent of state-enterprise fixed 
assets, with self-raised investment at 42.5 percent, while 
collective enterprises received only 0.42 percent of their funds 
from the national budget, with self-raised investment at 47.66 
percent, making self-financed investment 5 points higher for 
collective than state enterprises. For enterprises of the same 
size, tax rates were the same for ones of varying forms of 
ownership (with the exception of "the three kinds of foreign 
trade" enterprises), with the state not obtaining asset taxes or 
rents from its invested capital. This investment-source 
difference, as to both earned-profit capability and profit 
distribution, caused differences between state and collective 
enterprises. 2) As to industrial makeup, collective enterprises 
were concentrated mostly in lines, such as light industry, 
commerce, and catering services, while state enterprises were 
mainly distributed in the field of heavy industry. As China had 
always focused its energies on establishing a complete 
industrial system from the early days of the founding of the PRC 
to the late 1970s, emphasizing heavy-industrial development, 
when the state set wage policy, it had always set wages higher 
for heavy than light industry, to reflect its industrial 
difference. This difference has always followed along, being a 
system factor causing the wage discrepancy between state and 
collective enterprises. 3) As to employee quality and makeup, 
average literacy levels were higher for employees in state than 
collective enterprises, with state enterprises having about 33 
percent more employees with more than high school educations. 
But collective enterprises had 20 percent more women employees 
than state enterprises. These differences in employee quality 
were bound to cause a discrepancy in wage levels. 4) State 
enterprises were generally larger than collective ones. In 1990 
for instance, the average unit in state industrial enterprises 
had 418 employees, while urban collective industrial enterprises 
averaged only 115 employees, with the enterprise size-effect 
generally creating a distribution discrepancy. 5) During 
periods of national economic fluctuation, state enterprises 
received much more government protection than collective ones, 
with employee wage and bonus rigidity higher than collective 
ones. So while economic growth rates declined, employee incomes 
certainly did not drop correspondingly. In contrast, collective 
enterprises largely had to pay the price of retrenchment, with 
their employee incomes generally falling along with economic 
growth rates. During times of economic expansion, these two 
sectors were restrained by state macroeconomic control about the 
same. These were factors in the different degrees of impact on 
their wage levels by economic fluctuations. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  V. The Income-Distribution Gap Among Chinese Residents </H5>
  China's rural household income-distribution order underwent 
a 
great change after rural economic reform. As rural farm-worker 
productivity increased, a large group of surplus rural workers 
shifted out of traditional agriculture, speeding up the mobility 
and reorganization of the rural productive forces, resulting in 
the evolution and upgrading of the rural industrial structure. 
  These changes in the level of productive forces and 
industrial structure, while raising rural income levels, also 
widened the income gaps among various regions and households. 
By 1989 and 1990, the rural income base coefficient had reached 
31 percent, 10 points higher than in 1978. As to all provinces, 
by 1990, in more economically-developed Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and 
Guangdong and minority nationality-concentrated Xinjiang, 
Qinghai, and Ningxia, the base coefficient was higher at 30-34 
percent. In the three municipalities and central China's Hunan, 
Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, the base coefficient was lower at 
20-25 percent, being lowest in Jiangxi at 20 percent. As to the 
three main regions of east, central and west, the peasant income 
gap was higher in eastern China, with the base coefficient at 32 
percent; with the gap smaller in central China at 27 percent, 
and at 28 percent in western China. 
  The wider rural income gap after reform and opening had many 
causes. 
  1. The various contract responsibility systems practiced in 
the rural areas thoroughly broke free from the pre-reform 
collective economy's "big pottism," from a system perspective 
creating the climate and terms for better income distribution 
and making it possible for peasants to get wealthy through 
autonomous hard work. 
  2. The varying amount of production essentials possessed by 
peasant households was also a key factor in the distribution 
gap. While rural land was distributed by headcount, as to 
families of the same size, differences in the numbers of family 
members who were workers caused differences in the gains derived 
from the same amounts of land. Statistics show that in a family 
of five, every additional worker raised overall household income 
by 357 yuan. This was because peasant households with more 
workers could not only invest more labor in the same amount of 
land, choosing more cash crops that required more labor, but 
also could invest surplus labor and time in household sidelines, 
construction, transportation, commerce, and township industries, 
thus raising overall family income. 
  In addition to the income disparity caused by varying 
numbers 
of workers, worker quality also had an obvious impact on income 
distribution. Putting peasant family-member education levels in 
eight grades, from illiterate and semiliterate to college 
graduate, each one-grade raise in peasant family-member average 
education-grade increased peasant household overall income by 
34.97 yuan. Peasant household-worker quantity and quality is 
reflected not only in agricultural production, but also in 
choice of household sidelines, diversified operations, and 
nonfarm industry capabilities. Data shows that for every 100 
workers with educations above junior high school, 40 are in 
purely peasant households, while 58, or 45 percent more, work in 
nonfarm industry. This distribution impact due to worker 
quality was hard to reflect under the distribution system before 
reform and opening. 
  In addition, as to production essentials, the size of 
household assets such as large farm machinery and equipment, the 
fixed assets needed for nonfarm industry and the working capital 
needed for the production process, similarly had an obvious 
impact on overall peasant-household income. Data shows that 
based on overall peasant-household income, productive assets 
have a returns rate of 9 percent a year. 
  3. Peasant-household geographic and natural conditions also 
have a significant impact on peasant income. Peasant households 
in more economically-developed regions have higher incomes. In 
1990, in the three municipalities of Shanghai, Beijing, and 
Tianjin, peasant incomes averaged respectively 1,664.65 yuan, 
1,261.11 yuan, and 1,069.04 yuan; 1985 to 1990 income growth 
rates averaged respectively 15.61 percent, 10.22 percent, and 
13.62 percent, all higher than the national average of 9.63 
percent. But in provinces and autonomous regions, such as 
Gansu, Guizhou, and Tibet, due to poorer natural and geographic 
conditions, 1990 net incomes averaged only 398.99 yuan, 435.14 
yuan, and 437.71 yuan, respectively, only about one-quarter that 
of the average Shanghai peasant income; net income annual growth 
rates were respectively 9.35 percent, 8.61 percent, and 4.35 
percent, all below the national average. This shows that the 
peasants living in these places have not only current net 
incomes lower than other regions, but also an income gap that is 
still continuing to widen. 
  4. The peasant-household income gap is also reflected in 
household production structure and operating orientation. By 
1990, the percentage of purely peasant households had dropped to 
25 percent, with that of those engaged mainly in agriculture but 
concurrently working in nonfarm industry at 65 percent, and 
those working mainly in nonfarm industry while continuing to do 
some farming at 10 percent. This evolution of the rural 
industrial structure has changed the workforce disposition, 
changing peasant-household income sources, and causing an income 
gap among peasant families. 
  In contrast to the rural income-distribution situation, 
urban 
income-distribution inequality is much less. From 1985 to 1990, 
the urban income-distribution base coefficient was 20-22 
percent. Using the information-theory concept of entropy, and 
Theil Henri's proposed dual methodology, the calculated urban 
income-distribution T and L coefficients were respectively 13-14 
percent and 11-12 percent. In other words, when the overall 
low-income group is larger, China's overall urban 
income-distribution level is lower than the base coefficient at 
equal-value calculation. Of the calculations for 24 provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1990, the base 
coefficient was higher than the national average for 17 and 
lower for seven. The base coefficient was highest for Xinjiang 
at 33.6 percent, with Guangdong and Qinghai next at respectively 
25 percent and 25.7 percent, and lowest for Liaoning at only 18 
percent, with Tianjin and Hebei respectively at 19.8 percent and 
19.6 percent. The T-index calculations resulted similarly in 
Xinjiang being the highest at 22.9 percent, and higher for 
provinces and regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai, 
Hainan, and Fujian, with the trend being similar to the results 
calculated according to the base coefficient. The similar 
results achieved from calculations according to these four 
different methodologies show that China's overall urban income 
distribution is still quite equal. Moreover, as to the time 
order from 1985 to the present, there has not been any 
significant expansion trend. 
  The causes of our relative urban-income equality are our 
urban-employee wage and subsidy systems and our urban 
population's employment system. The urban wage system that had 
been practiced ever since the founding of the PRC was 
characterized by equalitarianism right from the start. This had 
reached an extremely severe degree during the cultural 
revolution. But after reform and opening, in 1985, we conducted 
a one-time national reform of our wage system. This reform, 
widely instituted enterprises for the linking of payrolls to 
economic efficiency, while devolving state wage-management 
jurisdiction to lower administrative levels, leaving the state 
to control only the total payroll. In institutions, we changed 
the graded wage system to a structural one of mostly wages by 
job. Our main aspirations in this wage reform were to break 
free from equalitarianism, to reflect a spirit of rewarding hard 
work and excellence and penalizing indolence and inferiority. 
But as enterprise wage reform largely tried to widen the income 
gap among enterprises, this change quite naturally was resisted 
by enterprise competition, obviously not achieving its desired 
result. 
  In the distribution among employees within enterprises, the 
resistance to breaking with equalitarianism was even greater. 
In state organs and institutions, the institution of the 
structural wage system not only did not eliminate distribution 
equalitarianism, but also naturally affected the household 
income-distribution situation. After 1985, employee non-wage 
income grew very quickly. While the ratio of urban-employee 
non-wage income to gross income was 20.3 percent in 1985, this 
had climbed to 25.7 percent by 1990. Of the many types of 
non-wage income, such as bathing, transportation, and labor 
costs, most were equalitarian distribution without regard for 
matters, such as age, seniority, rank, or contribution. This 
made employee overall income-distribution equalitarianism even 
more serious. In addition, related price reform and the 
practice of various nonstaple-food subsidies were even more so 
distributed according to headcount. 
  China's employment system also had an obvious impact in 
urban 
household income-equalization. In the cities, as long as a 
youth reaching working age waited patiently, with no nitpicking 
about job quality or employment site, a job was just a matter of 
time. And once employed, minus special conditions, quitting or 
being fired was generally impossible. The number of employed 
household members was one of the factors affecting the income 
gap. And the universal full employment shrank the income gap. 
  Finally, most urban residents had no capital goods or 
investments, which ensured from another perspective that the 
income gap would not grow too large. Of course, while the rapid 
increase in household operations and the rise of stock markets 
in recent years have shaken urban income-distribution 
equalization, they have not yet at least had a substantial 
impact on the overall income-distribution order, or become its 
decisive factor. 
  Putting urban and rural residents together for a graded 
ranking, to calculate the income-distribution inequality 
coefficient, shows that China's national income-distribution 
inequality is greater than that calculated separately for either 
rural or urban residents. Moreover, this inequality is growing 
in extent yearly. This shows that China's income-distribution 
inequality is due largely to our dual-economy feature. To 
improve China's income-distribution situation, we will have to 
on one hand overcome our urban income-equalitarianism tendency, 
and on the other strive to shrink our urban-rural distribution 
gap. 
<H5>  VI. The Matter of Absolute vs Relative Poverty </H5>
  Absolute vs relative poverty is another angle from which to 
measure income-distribution inequality. We are here adopting 
the methodology proposed by Victor R. Fuchs, calling thalf of 
the population with incomes less than the average the 
relative-poverty population. In defining rural absolute 
poverty, we are using the PRC State Council's 1985 definition, 
that those with average annual net incomes below 200 yuan are in 
absolute poverty, and those with net incomes averaging less than 
150 yuan a year are in extreme poverty. Based on a comparison 
of the 1985 rural absolute-poverty line and the national 
average, we have set the urban absolute-poverty line at 375 
yuan, using the same method to set that year's urban 
extreme-poverty line at 282 yuan. When calculating absolute 
poverty, while we have used the same criteria for all years, we 
have respectively used the urban-rural retail price indexes to 
correct the poverty lines for all years. In addition, when 
calculating the percentage of the population that is in absolute 
peoverty, we have assumed that the incomes of the lowest-income 
group conform to consecutive even distribution. 
  Our calculations show that from 1981 through 1990, our 
percentage of urban absolute-poverty households was in a general 
declining trend, with the percentage of extreme-poverty ones not 
so stable, being highest in 1988 at 3.67 percent, and lowest in 
1984 at only 0.97 percent. From a macroeconomic-setting 
analysis, this trend was rational, as 1984 was this decade's 
year of highest GNP growth at 14.7 percent, while that year's 
overall urban retail price index was only 2.5 percent, with the 
urban average annual income-growth rate at a high of 15.23 
percent. While 1988 saw a GNP growth rate of 11 percent, with 
average income growth of 17.8 percent, that year's urban overall 
retail price index reached a high of 21.3 percent. Under normal 
conditions, during periods of inflation, low-income losses and 
gross-income ratios are necessarily much greater than 
high-income losses and gross income ratios. So it was not 
strange that 1988 saw a higher percentage of households in 
extreme poverty. In rural areas, the percentages of absolute 
and extreme poverty experienced a process of first falling and 
then rising, which was obviously on the same track with the 
urban-rural income gap first shrinking and then growing. This 
shows that the changes in the percentages of rural absolute and 
relative poverty are more sensitive to changes in urban-rural 
income-distribution policy than those at the average-income 
level. In other words, changes in urban-rural 
income-distribution policy have a more direct and severe impact 
on the low-income stratum. Official statistics for 1988 and 
1989 show the number of rural poverty-households respectively at 
19.7775 million and 19.5456 million, with the poverty-stricken 
populations respectively at 88.48 million and 86.61 million, for 
percentages of the whole rural population respectively at 10.74 
percent and 10.41 percent. Obviously, official estimates are 
much more conservative than our calculations. 
  Relative poverty is a phenomenon that has always existed in 
economic life. In the first half of the 1980s, our urban 
relative-poverty rate was quite low at 2.61-4.3 percent. In 
1985, our percentage of relative-poverty households rose to 
12.48 percent, since then it has remained at 8-9 percent. That 
our relative-poverty-household rates stayed higher during the 
last half of the 1980s than during the first half was due to our 
income-distribution policy being more open and flexible. In the 
rural areas after 1981, the percentages of households in 
relative poverty rose yearly, peaking in 1989 at 15.6 percent. 
The rise in the percentage of relative-poverty households in the 
rural areas confirms from another angle the annually widening 
rural income-distribution gap, which is basically consistent 
with our conclusions in the previous sections of this article. 
  Rural absolute and relative poverty are caused by many 
factors. 
  1. In certain regions, such as remote mountain areas, rocky 
mountainous areas, high, cold mountain areas, minority 
nationality regions, reserve areas, and localities with a high 
incidence of disease, due to poor natural and geographic 
conditions, residents who are dependent mostly on farming and 
livestock-raising income have generally lower incomes, having 
become a group of households and populations that can hardly 
escape their poverty. 
  2. In ordinary areas, certain peasant populations are large 
in size, with many non-adult children and old people who cannot 
work, or longstanding family illnesses, a lack of workers or 
strong workers, shortages of labor to put into production, and 
even more difficulty in having surplus labor to engage in other 
industrial-sideline production, leaving their gross incomes too 
low, and their average incomes even lower. 
  3. Capital goods and real estate ownership is generally low. 
In contrast to others, these peasant households have to put 
more of their incomes into acquiring housing and improving their 
living conditions, which is bound to further squeeze out 
production funds, thus further lowering their production-fund 
input, creating a lack of reproduction capability, and forming a 
vicious cycle. 
  4. The percentage of purely farm households in the 
poverty-stricken population is very high, with very few engaged 
in industrial sideline production, leaving them largely 
dependent on the weather, unable to supplement agriculture with 
industry, and with lower incomes. The causes of urban poverty 
are mainly too few family members working and too low job and 
industry incomes. As a key feature of urban employment is that 
family-member jobs are more concentrated, with many husbands and 
wives, fathers and sons, and mothers and daughters all working 
in the same factory or unit, if the income of the factory or 
unit is low, this affects not only the individual, but also the 
whole family's income. In addition, urban single-member and 
unemployable families are also a component of poverty-stricken 
households. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  VII. The Illegal-Income Problem </H5>
  There is no use denying that China's high-income stratum 
contains both those who got rich through hard work and operating 
in the right way, as well as no lack of upstarts who exploited 
their authority for private gain. The public aversion to and 
bitter hatred of income-distribution injustice is directed 
largely toward this illegal-income phenomenon and those with 
illegal incomes. Illegal incomes come in many types, such as 
through bribetaking and illegal profiteering. Some exploit 
foreign business and trade activities to buy in commodities and 
equipment of poor quality through improper trading procedures, 
taking bribes from foreign firms at the cost of sacrificing 
national and collective interests; others exploit their 
commodity-distribution authority in domestic commodity 
transactions, in violation of national policy, to distribute 
certain planned-target commodities in short market supply to 
nonplanned-distribution partners, taking bribes for this; and 
yet others exploit their job responsibilities in areas, such as 
personnel, residence registration management authority, job 
planning and transfer, and residence movement and registration, 
to solicit bribes from their service partners. Certain 
housing-management personnel exploit their housing-assignment 
authority, some key school officials take advantage of their 
student-recruitment authority, and certain hospital doctors and 
nurses make use of their patient-reception and 
operation-performance powers to demand and take improper gifts 
from their service targets. Some industrial and commercial 
management personnel, tax collectors, and health quarantine 
officials engage in extortion activities, such as industrial and 
commercial registration, tax examination and collection, and 
health inspection. There are many such examples that do not 
need to be listed one by one. In addition, certain people 
exploit our dual-track system of planning and markets, making 
exorbitant profits through lease-finding activities. Such 
people might take advantage of powers, such as 
shareholding-enterprise-listing examination and approval 
authority and loan-allotment jurisdiction, to demand firsthand 
shares from enterprises or they might profiteer through 
commodities in short market supply, gold and foreign exchange, 
or cultural relics and antiques, to get very rich through 
black-market trading. Some household operators and private 
enterprise owners practice bribery and gift-giving, buying off 
tax collectors to evade taxes; some use means, such as under and 
deceptive reporting of business turnover, overreporting of 
costs and underreporting of income to evade taxes. A few 
enterprise officers and accountants use public office for 
private gain, embezzling public monies and stealing what is 
entrusted to their care in economic activities. While the 
phenomenon of illegally acquired income is a very isolated one 
in China, it certainly has an inestimable impact on China's 
income-distribution order and the public mindset. These 
illegal-income recipients have a consumption style far above 
that of ordinary families, making some people feel outdone, and 
leaving people even more sensitive to income-distribution 
injustice. This phenomenon is even likely to cause public 
dissatisfaction with government and is a hidden danger to social 
and political stability. 
  The black-market, lease-finding, and corruption phenomenon 
is 
the inevitable outcome of an unsound legal system and imperfect 
business-management system. It is an unavoidable economic 
phenomenon for developing countries in a particular 
economic-development stage. It can be gradually overcome only 
through reforming the political and economic systems, 
establishing sound legal institutions, perfecting market forces 
and improving government administration. 
<H5>  VIII. A Brief Summary </H5>
  We have learned through analyzing the 
income-distribution-gap 
status quo that China's urban-rural distribution gap is still 
quite large, with our rural-income base coefficient quite high 
at about 30 percent. We also have a distribution gap between 
developed zones and undeveloped regions. First, we need to 
affirm that China's rural base coefficient remains within an 
internationally-recognized rational standard. As to our 
interregional gap, from the efficiency angle, while 
economically backward regions have a lower level of development, 
their income ratio to the national average is higher than that 
of developed zones. Taking 1989 for instance, the three 
provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong had a ratio of 
income to the national average of respectively 73.99 percent, 
85.24 percent, and 98.73 percent, with a ratio of rural 
consumption to per capita GNP of respectively 43.26 percent, 
44.45 percent, and 41.76 percent. But the three provinces of 
Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu had a ratio of urban consumption to 
per capita GNP of respectively 168.3 percent, 140.44 percent, 
and 181.72 percent, as well as a ratio of rural consumption to 
per capita GNP of respectively 55.94 percent, 54.91 percent, and 
42.26 percent, all higher than Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong. 
This shows that the state provides distribution consideration 
and subsidies to backward regions. In addition, as to the way 
to eliminate the urban-rural and regional gaps, either through 
curbing the high-income stratum and high-income-region income 
growth to shrink the gap, or through promoting faster economic 
development in low-income regions and among the low-income 
stratum, thus achieving a high-level of joint prosperity, our 
correct option obviously must be the latter. 
  From a development perspective, China is going to be faced 
with a long historical period of still quite difficult 
industrialization and urbanization missions. By 1990, China 
still had 73.59 percent of its population living in rural areas, 
with about 60 percent of its workforce engaged in farmwork. To 
decrease our agricultural population and workforce, so that the 
rural population shifts to cities and the agricultural workforce 
to nonfarm industry, our immediate option must be to continue to 
vigorously develop in a planned and step-by-step way all types 
of township and village enterprises that conform to our 
industrial-development orientation. In this process, the 
different paces of workforce shift, the order in which this 
occurs, and the difference in labor productivity of traditional 
and modern industry, will be bound to mean that the income gap 
among groups will exist and grow. But this is precisely an 
essential process that must be undergone in order to achieve 
joint prosperity. In addition, in western China, in certain 
relatively backward border zones, we have speeded up the pace of 
reform and opening in recent years, so that as our national 
industrialization ladder advances, coastal-zone-development 
marginal costs rise steadily and western China speeds up its 
development of resource industries, such as raw materials and 
power, the development gap among regions will eventually shrink. 
Of course, this process will be a long one, not to be 
accomplished all in one move.

<F P=106> [Article by Mo Shang-wen (5459 1424 2429): "China's </F>
Employment System Reform Faces Serious Challenges--Unemployement 
Is a Concern That Spans the Century"] 
  [Text] China has never admitted to having an unemployment 
problem. It merely termed unemployment "awaiting employment." 
Nevertheless, as the situation developed, in 1993 China began to 
admit to the existence of an unemployment problem and officially 
formulated and extended measures providing relief funds. 
However, many experts have noted that since reform of the labor 
system, much of the labor force is bound to become armies of 
unemployed. Thus the situation warrants greater attention. As a 
joint Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Civil Affairs report 
noted, China's unemployment situation is grim. It will become a 
centennial worry. 
  According to reports, just as the State Council received 
this 
report, five separate long lines of people created disorder on a 
nationwide scale while seeking work. Li Peng truly highly 
regards the report. He says that we definitely cann ot allow the 
unemployment problem to worsen. If peasants or workers rebel, 
our CPC will be unable to hold onto state power. 
  As one concerned noted, the report proposed outlooks for 
reform of China's labor and employment systems. There still are 
two possibilities: 
  One, a balanced interim. At present, the masses of 
enterprises have begun to be psychologically prepared for 
unemployment and smashing the "three irons." They have 
considerable psychological endurance to oscillation of the 
labor and employment system tracks. At the same time, there will 
be no big problems, especially with agricultural development and 
in most villages if the unemployment insurance mechanism and the 
unemployment-reemployment mechanism are gradually perfected, 
price reform goes smoothly, price increases are not great and 
the government evenly exchanges functions and streamlines 
organization. With these conditions it is estimated that after 
three to five years of painstaking work, labor demand and supply 
relationships under market mechanisms gradually can be 
established. Enterprises also will get great vitality from labor 
and employment system reform, seizing the last opportunity of 
this century to bring up economic development to a new stage. 
  China hopes for and seeks such results, yet there are two 
crucial non-economic factors: 
  1. Political stability with no change in the overall 
direction of reform; 
  2. Unemployment problems brought on by labor and employment 
system reform do not threaten social stability. 
  These two non-economic conditions ultimately depend on the 
judgment and choice of 1.2 billion Chinese people. Labor and 
employment system reform will be a self-revolution. Whether it 
succeeds depends on how many people have the determination and 
the ability to accept such a revolution. 
  A short time ago, Shanghai did a sample survey of workers 
throughout the municipality; 94 percent of workers appraised 
reform and the open door policy as good or relatively good. 
Their attitudes toward the next, greater reform dynamics are: 
39 percent believe in supporting it provided the overall 
situation is advantageous; 35 percent believe in supporting it 
provided they can bear it economically. When asked about the 
psychology and acceptability of drawing unemployment relieft, 
several 10,000s of Shanghai's unemployed replied: 73.3 percent 
felt it psychologically hard or very hard to bear; 78.24 percent 
had economic difficulties while unemployed. 
  In electing labor and employment system reform, 15 million 
to 
30 million workers in state-owned enterprises face grim 
challenges. Deeper and more thorough government organization 
reform implies that nearly one-half of the 34 million cadres 
nationwide must depart from government organizations and enter 
the marketplace. These 10 million cadres will face yet an other 
grim challenge. There also are those reckoned at one million 
potential unemployed--the peasants. The spring of 1994 just 
passed and a surging wave of public project workers arrived at 
the coastal cities earlier, constituting a serious threat to 
railway transport, railway stations and the social order of 
large cities. To have a balanced transition of labor and 
employment system reform, these all are unavoidable conundrums 
which have to be faced and must be resolved appropriately. 
  2. Urgently step on the brakes and return to a planned 
system. This is a result which China does not wish for and 
hopes to avoid at all costs. But it is not impossible. In the 
process of electing to reform the labor and employment systems, 
if most enterprises and workers cannot accept it and the masses 
underestimate the unemployment threat, they will be in a muddle 
by the unemployment attack. Peasants congest the cities. Price 
reforms are not in concert. Serious inflation and large scale 
unemployment intersect. Establishment of unemployment security 
and reemployment systems have not kept up. This may affect 
social order and even bring on a social crisis. Ultimately the 
government will have no choice but to resume direct 
interference. To continue to ensure high employment goals, 
enterprises will have to drop labor and employment system 
reforms. 
  The aforementioned report also noted that in the 1990s, 
China 
still faces a stituation of total labor supply far greater than 
total demand. According to forecasts, in the year 2,000 the 
nationwide labor-age population will be 781 million people, up 
84 million people over 1990; the average annual growth rate is 
1.2 percent. Of which, the average annual growth rate during the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan is 1.3 percent, and during the Ninth 
Five-Year Plan, one percent. 
  Compared to the 1980s, in the 1990s the characteristics of 
labor resources are: 
  1. Less population entering the labor-age and lower 
growth rates. Between 1991 and the year 2,000, some 188 
million people will be of labor-age nationwide, 6.25 million 
less than i n the 1980s. The annual growth rate will fall from 
3.1 percent to 2.4 percent. 
  2. More population pulling out of labor-age. In 
the 1990s it will be 86.2 million people, up 12.8 million people 
compared to the 1980s, up 17.4 percent. 
  Among the labor-age population, employment posts need not be 
provided to a portion of it for various reasons. If the labor 
force participation rate is calculated at 82 percent in the year 
2,000, the labor supply seeking employment posts will reach 640 
million, up 74 million over 1990, or an average annual increase 
of 7.4 million people at an average annual growth rate o f 1.9 
percent. 
  The situation of hidden unemployment within enterprises is 
relatively serious. Within enterprises owned by the whole people 
alone, surplus personnel have reached 15 million, and some 
estimate there are 30 million. Surplus rural labor is even more 
astonishing. According to predictions, at present agricultural 
labor approximately has a surplus of 40 percent. 
  With overall consideration of various factors, in the next 
decade the issue of employment will have to be resolved 
nationwide for about 202 million people. 
  According to methods of calculating the employment growth 
elasticity coefficient used by the World Bank, between 1979 and 
1988, China's GNP increased 150.2 percent. Social labor grew 
35.3 percent. The employment growth elasticity coefficient was 
0.235. Inferred from the goal that the total value of GNP will 
double by the end of the century, in the next 10 years the 
average annual social labor growth rate is only 1.55 percent. A 
10 year increase in labor force demand is only 94 million people. 
  Even if the economic growth rate is somewhat higher, if the 
growth rate were eight percent, in the 1990s there would only be 
about 120 million new employment posts. 
  Of course, one also must add the more than 8,000 employment 
posts withdrawn from labor-age and vacated. In this way, it can 
be expected there will be about 200 million employment posts. 
  However, two factors must be considered: first, the great 
savings on labor force demand from technological advances and 
the management revolution. The 1990s will not be like the 1980s 
in terms of the employment growth elasticity coefficient 
increase. Second, a considerable portion of the population 
pulling out of labor-age may continue to remain in their 
employment posts. Some of the labor age population may have more 
than one job and occupy two or more employment posts. 
  Thus, this implies that China will bring an enormous 
unemployment force into the 21st century. This is a worry that 
will last into the next century.

<F P=106> [Article by Cheng Lianchang (4453 6647 2490), Ministry of </F>
Personnel Office Vice Minister: "Speed Up Fostering and 
Development of Personnel Markets"] 
  [Text] Personnel markets are an important component of 
China's socialist market system. The Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee proposed "reform the labor system 
and gradually create a labor force market," an important part of 
which is energetically developing the personnel market. The 
basic function of the labor market is to play a fundamental role 
in allocating personnel resources through market mechanisms. For 
a long time now, the contradiction of wasted talent and a 
shortage of personnel has been prominent because of the dominant 
position of the centralized job placement system. Therefore, 
fully utilizing talent and rationally allocating personnel 
resources are important issues China faces in economic 
development and in thorough implementation of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's policy to "respect intellectuals and respect talent" 
with regard to establishing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
<H5>  China's Personnel Market Development Situation </H5>
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the centralized job placement system is ever more 
unsuited to reform, the open door policy, and the needs of 
economic development. Floating personnel characterized by the 
dual choice of personnel and units effectively has attacked the 
actual form of ownership over personnel by certain units and 
departments. It has broken the fetters on talent held by the 
centralized job placement system. Through the circulation of 
personnel many people have found work posts in which they can 
play a role. After more than a decade of growth, there have been 
striking successes in personnel circulation work. The party and 
the state have formulated a series of policies, laws and 
regulations to encourage and support the circulation of 
personnel, striving to create conditions in society for the 
circulation of personnel. Government personnel departments at 
all levels have commenced various forms of personnel circulation 
social services, sending a great number of personnel to 
enterprises owned by the state, foreign-funded enterprises, 
rural enterprises, scientific research organizations run by the 
people and the first line of agricultural production. Between 
1983 and 1992, more than eight million people have flowed 
through personnel circulation service organizations, promoting 
economic construction and development in various causes. 
Personnel circulation work initiatives have made a good base 
for personnel markets. Personnel markets grew rapidly after 
Comrade Xiaoping's southern tour and the 14th Central Committee 
of the CPC. At present nationwide there are nearly 500 fixed 
personnel market sites in existence. Preliminary market 
mechanisms have formed in areas where the economy is relatively 
developed. 
<H5>  Necessity and Urgency of Nurturing and Developing Personnel </H5>
Markets 
  However, the centralized job placement system still occupies 
a leading position in the current personnel management system. 
The personnel structure is irrational. Irrational personnel 
structure, the irrational use of personnel resources and under 
utilization of personnel still are common problems. On the one 
hand a relatively amount of personnel is underemployed. On the 
other hand personnel is in seriously short supply and deficient. 
An important way to resolve these issues is to accelerate 
nurturing and development of personnel markets. Use market 
mechanisms instead of the centralized job placement system and 
rationally allocate personnel resources through market 
readjustment. 
  At present, China's personnel markets are growing slowly. 
They have become "stagnant" markets among the essential ones, 
affecting the rational allocation of personnel and other 
production elements and the coordinated operation of the entire 
market system. 
  Current administrative system reforms, organizational 
reform, 
promotion of reform of the state's system of public officials 
and the personnel systems of enterpris e and facility sectors 
require establishment of employment mechanisms that people can 
enter and exit, where there is dual choice that encourages 
competition and uses the market to regulate personnel supply and 
demand. Various types of circulating personnel under 
organizational reform, plus those who leave their original unit 
via dismissals, resignation or discharge, requires that they 
select units in the personnel market. At the same time the 
employing unit must also select appropriate talent from the 
personnel market. By establishing complete personnel markets, we 
can forge a channel for personnel to enter and exit units, 
promote dual choices in personnel markets and units, and realize 
the best allocation. Therefore, accelerating nurturing and 
growth of personnel marekts has become an urgent task. 
<H5>  Overall Concept for Nurturing and Developing Personnel </H5>
Markets 
  The guiding ideology for nurturing and developing personnel 
markets is: under the state's macroeconomic readjustment and 
control, speed up establishment of personnel market policies, 
legal and regulatory systems, and social service and social 
security systems. Establish personnel markets suited to a 
socialist market economy to fully develop and use China's 
personnel resources, allow people to exhaust their talents and 
use them fully and grow in service to the economy and all 
undertakings. 
  The overall goals of nurturing and developing personnel 
markets are: Personnel choose employment themselves, units 
employ personnel themselves, the market regulates supply and 
demand, perfected social security and social services, and 
market regulation plays a basic role in allocating personnel 
resources under the state's macroeconomic readjustment and 
control. 
  The major steps in nurturing and developing personnel 
markets 
are: 
  Establish the dominance of personnel and units in 
personnel markets. Grant authority to personnel to choose 
employment themselves and units to employ personnel themselves. 
Ensure dual choice of personnel and units under public, equal 
and competitive conditions. Thoroughly destroy actual ownership 
of certain personnel by units and departments. Alter the state's 
unnecessary direct interference in employment of personnel by 
units. Allow personnel and units to become the mainstays of 
market activities. 
  Establish market regulating mechanisms. Further 
manifest the principle of to each according to his labor. Use 
rational labor compensation relationships. Utilize the market's 
mutual regulating role in personnel supply and demand 
relationships. Achieve rational deployment of personnel 
resources. 
  Enhance the state's macroeconomic readjustment and 
control functions. Via policies, laws and regulation, 
economic and certain administrative measures, the state 
normalized market activities, guides the direction of the flow 
of personnel, reduces market limitations and blindness, controls 
the volume and speed of personnel circulation and realizes a 
balanced state between the total supply and demand of personnel. 
  Perfect the social security system. Reform the 
current system in which units handle insurance. Establish 
complete unemployment, pension, disability, medical treatment 
and social security systems. As soon as possible, set up and 
promote insurance systems in which units of organizations and 
handle unemployment and pension insurance systems, creating good 
social conditions for personnel markets. 
  Complete the social services system. Fully use the 
organizational and service functions of circulating personnel 
service organizations under government personnel departments in 
personnel markets. Using them at the core, set up a circulating 
personnel organizational system which is multilayered, 
multifunctional and covers all of society. 
  Implementation steps in nurturing and developing personnel 
markets: For the most part, use the personnel market sites 
established and consolidated in medium-sized and large cities in 
the last few years. Formulate laws and regulations complementary 
to personnel markets. After a certain amount of practice, strive 
to form on a national scope a relatively comple te personnel 
market system. 
<H5>  Personnel Market Development Plans </H5>
  New topics which our personnel departments face are those of 
nurturing and developing personnel markets, and making the 
personnel system better suited to the needs of new conditions in 
the socialist market economic system. Towards this end, we must 
liberate our thinking, seek truth from facts, let concepts 
evolve, work solidly, and according to the principles of party 
cadre management and relevant government policies, gradually 
transform idle and short supply talent towards market 
circulation and rational use, readjusting for surplus and 
shortage. Gradually realize the transformation from personnel 
cirulation by unit towards dual choices. Gradually manifest a 
transformation of the centralized job placement system of the 
personnel resources deployment model towards the form of 
deployment of personnel resources in which state macroeconomic 
controls play a fundamental role in personnel markets. Make 
personnel work better serve the economy, serve the employing 
unit and serve personnel nurturing and use. 
  To explore establishment of a national personnel market, in 
October 1993 we held the first national personnel market talent 
technology exchange conference. The scale of the conference was 
unprecedented. Some 68 State Council departments, committees and 
bureaus and units from 40 provinces, municipalities, autonomous 
regions, municipalities directly under the central government 
and cities listed in the plan organized more than 4,000 
enterprise and undertaking units to recruit personnel 
nationwide. Good social and economic results were obtained: 
Some 90,000 people of various talents went to the conference in 
reply to recruitment and more than 30,000 people exchanged 
intentions. Some 350 patented technologies worth 37 million yuan 
were concluded, playing a role in motivating promotion of the 
formation of a nationwide personnel market. Shortly thereafter 
we also held a national personnel circulation work meeting. The 
experience of setting up personnel markets in various places was 
exchanged and the next work plan to develop personnel markets 
was studied. 
  The main work to further nurture and develop personnel 
markets should be: 
  Deepen reform and further promote rational personnel 
circulation. First, deepen reforms of the personnel system, 
and while promoting a national public servant system, further 
reform the employment system of undertakings and enterprises. 
Further implement dual authority to choose employment. Second, 
adopt measures and study how to solve existing residency and 
cadre identity issues so as to be appropriate for the needs of 
personnel circulation. Open up circulation channels for 
personnel in different areas and different ownership system 
units. Third, further reform "centralized job placement system" 
personnel methods. Expand the scope of personnel circulation. 
Where conditions exist, personnel markets can work, whether the 
choice is for individual people or organizations, undertakings 
or enterprises. To better suit the needs of economic 
development, we also must adopt some active measures to open up 
international personnel exchanges. 
  Energetically develop personnel markets, enhance 
personnel market construction nationwide. Personnel market 
construction involves two aspects. On the one hand we must 
implement dual choice authority through reform and legislation, 
set up a complete social security system, perfect social 
services, and promote the formation of personnel market 
mechanisms. On the other hand we must really resolve the 
personnel market's necessary issues of sites, equipment, 
organization and staffing. Guide personnel markets to develop in 
the direction of diversity and networking. Gradually form 
different layered and different scales of pers onnel market 
systems centered around various medium-sized and large cities. 
Based on various places where personnel markets are set up, 
accelerate establishment of nationwide unified, open, 
competitive, orderly personnel markets by establishing personnel 
information networks and organizing united recruitment 
activities. 
  Stress ancillary policy and legal and regulatory 
work. Developing personnel markets and promoting nationwide 
personnel circulation urgently requires enhanced per sonnel 
circulation legislative work. Resolving some current irrational 
personnel circulation phenomena and strengthening macroeconmic 
guidance also requires this. 
  Enhance personnel circulation service organization 
work. An essential social condition of establishing 
personnel markets and initiating personnel circulation work is 
the establishment and perfection of personnel circulation social 
service systems. On the one hand, further enhance work on 
personnel circulation organizations under government personnel 
departments. On the other hand encourage and guide the growth of 
sector, industry, unit and civil-run personnel circulation 
organizations. 
  Do a good job of personnel information work. This 
is fundamental work for setting up personnel markets and opening 
up personnel movement. Only by taking hold of a large volume of 
personnel supply and demand information and implementing social 
exchanges can personnel circulation results be improved to 
provide better service to personnnel and units. At present not 
only are we preparing the first national personnel information 
network, preparing to select several key information journals to 
publish personnel information periodicals but we also are taking 
note of developing the role of broadcasting, television, 
newspapers and other news media in personnel information work to 
advance the socialization of personnel information through 
various forms. 
  Nurturing and developing personnel markets is a systematic 
social process involving reform of the insurance and welfare, 
medical treatment, household registration and housing systems. 
Reliance on personnel departments alone is insufficient. It 
requires the strong support of each level of the government and 
relevant sectors. We hope to make nurturing and developing 
personnel markets an importart job to master in building a 
socialist market economic system, to bring it into overall 
market system planning to ensure coordinated development of 
personnel markets and other essential markets to make personnel 
markets play their proper role in China's socialist market 
economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Yan Meifu (0917 2734 4395): "Some Thoughts on </F>
Economic Rewards and Penalties in Family Planning Work in a 
Market Economy"] 
  [Excerpts] 
Reexamining the Role of Economic Rewards and Penalties in 
China's Population Control 
  Facts in the last 20 years prove that economic rewards and 
penalties have played a very important role in China's family 
planning. Their effect was decisive particularly among workers 
in the cities, and it can be said that family planning work was 
more effective in the cities than the rural areas because the 
role and efficacy of economic rewards and penalties are 
inseparable. For a long period of time, whenever one analyzed 
why the urban birth rate was more effectively controlled than 
rural birth rate, one often assumed that it was because urban 
population had a higher educational and cultural level or better 
access to social services, rather than forthrightly recognizing 
that economic rewards and penalties were the most important 
reason, and that penalties were much more effective when applied 
in the cities than the rural areas. But those were the facts. 
  During the 1970-80s, the effectiveness of economic rewards 
and penalties in family planning among urban workers could not 
be duplicated in the rural areas: urban workers who violated 
family planning rules were fined, denied bonuses, deprived of 
wage increase, demoted or even discharged. These penalties were 
aimed at the "life line" of workers at that time. One can just 
imagine in the era when the necessities of life depended on the 
coupons issued, the difficulties a worker faced if he lost his 
"iron rice bowl" and had to support an extra mouth at home; one 
can therefore easily appreciate why disobeying the system at 
that time was out of the question, and why urban workers, 
regardless of their desire for more children, did not dare give 
birth to more of them. According to a survey of women with 
one-child certificates in Beijing, their desired number of 
children was two.[.sup]1[/] In point of fact, under this 
reward-penalty system, workers in the cities were faced not with 
a balancing between rewards and penalties, but with a cruel 
choice between "existence" and "reproduction." Under normal 
circumstances, man would not give up "living" for "reproducing." 
  In the urban areas, this forceful and effective system was 
relied upon to control the reproductive behavior of workers. 
From a long range perspective of population control, this type 
of control was very beneficial and necessary. Psychology 
recognizes that modifying man's reproductive behavior can help 
change man's idea toward reproduction. After a suitable 
reproductive behavior is developed and fortified, people would 
change their idea of reproduction and family and, in the end, 
when they see the various benefits to limiting family size, they 
would consciously practice family planning. Among urban 
populations today, the consensus is not to have more children, 
and some people even do not want any children, suggesting that a 
close relationship indeed exists between the former forceful and 
effective reward-penalty system and the subsequent change of 
reproductive behavior. 
  In the rural areas, economic penalties in family planning 
never did carry the same degree of threat as in the cities. 
This is because the context in which economic penalties were 
applied was entirely different: peasants were not wage earners, 
they had no bonuses to withhold or wages to cut, and they were 
not afraid to be fired; they were responsible only for farming a 
few mu of land and keeping up their own shelters, and the basic 
principle of the socialist system itself limited the 
applicability of economic rewards and penalties in rural areas. 
Peasants who exceeded their birth quota could not be driven 
from the field they were responsible for farming; this explained 
why in the years when China's family planning work was 
proceeding smoothly, the rural birth rate was much higher than 
the urban birth rate. Data based on one percent sample of the 
1987 population survey shows that the average number of births 
for all Chinese women age 15-64 was 1.87, but 2.44 in the rural 
areas; and that the overall rural birth rate was 2.6, while the 
urban birth rate was 1.3. But this is only one aspect of the 
problem, for we should recognize that since family planning has 
been in effect, the rural birth rate has actually declined by a 
large margin, and that economic rewards and penalties did play 
an important role in the decline. This was because of the fact 
that for over a decade, economic penalties for excess births 
could deprive a rural family of a large part of its income for 
the whole year, putting the family in straitened circumstances 
and even poverty. This was not entirely without mental pressure 
on families that exceeded their birth quota; they could not 
calmly overlook the economic penalty imposed. According to a 
study of villages in Hebei by Zhou Ping et al.,[.sup]2[/] if 
peasants with single children (whether boys or girls) could 
choose one of the following economic rewards if they agreed not 
to have the second child -- additional land, wavier of 
collective labor, or access to employment -- 57.3 percent, 56 
percent and 68 percent respectively agreed; but if the penalty 
for having the second child involved money or land, the 
proportion of peasants that agreed not to have the second child 
dropped from 71 percent (without any penalty) to 12.7 percent. 
The investigators concluded therefore that to control births in 
the rural areas, a light penalty is better than no penalty, and 
a heavy penalty better than a light one. [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Difficulties Involved in Economic Penalties and Rewards in </H5>
Family Planning 
  In recent years, following the growth of rural commercial 
production enlivening the rural as well as urban economies, and 
particularly with the rise of a market economy, the 
reward-penalty system in family planning, which hitherto played 
an important role in controlling population increase, has run 
into difficulties. 
  To begin with, the single-child reward has lost its 
psychological effect in the rural areas. One reason is the 
measly reward. The "single-child subsidy" of several yuan per 
month, unchanged for a decade or more, has only symbolic meaning 
today and no effect whatsoever on peasants' reproductive 
behavior. Another reason is that economic rewards in rural areas 
were never conscientiously applied. Economic rewards such as 
doubling the land allotment for home construction, planting 
vegetables and grain, or priority for school admission and 
promises of some other types of economic support, all of these 
have become "open lies." Peasants neither believed nor were 
they interested in these rewards. The writer personally learned 
from a survey that a peasant named Zhang from Yaojia hamlet, 
Chengbei village in Linsui county of Sichuan Province, was the 
only one in that hamlet to respond positively that year to the 
family planning appeal and therefore awarded the "one-child 
certificate." When his child was 12 years old and he still had 
not received a single fen of the "single child living subsidy," 
he petitioned the village authorities and after making repeated 
requests for more than a year, he was given 300 yuan after 
discount and deduction. As for an extra allotment of land for 
his own use growing vegetables or building his house, he 
received no response despite inquiries. On the other hand, 
other families with multiple-births actually received several 
more times his share of land which they had since celebrated 
bountiful harvests. When the reward-penalty system loses its 
credibility, families with single children are discouraged and 
couples planning on having only one child also become 
disheartened. In rural areas in China, many child-bearing age 
couples would rather pay the penalties and have more than one 
child, than accept the reward for having only one child. 
Peasants cannot be blamed for these kinds of results. The 
reward and penalty system, which encourages peasants to practice 
family planning, limit the number of children and focus on the 
quality of children, has reached the point of practically zero 
effectiveness. 
  Furthermore, the reward-penalty system in rural areas today 
no longer carries the same clout, and peasants who exceed the 
birth quota are not at all afraid of the penalty, whether they 
have money to pay for it or not. The market economy has changed 
the former autarkic state of things in rural areas where eggs 
were bartered for salt and oil, and peasants income has since 
risen by a large margin; several hundreds or even thousands of 
yuan in penalty would no longer put many peasants in straitened 
circumstances or poverty, and they can come up with the money. 
Today, many excess-birth families in the rural areas invariably 
give birth only after consultations with parents and spouses and 
with the required penalty money in hand; therefore, imposing a 
fine on these newly rich peasants for excess birth amounts to no 
more than "pulling one hair of a cow," having no effect at all 
on their well being. To this group of peasants, the right to 
give birth has become a market commodity. In the context of 
family planning, such a viewpoint is wordless condemnation or 
bitter satire of the policy. And in another ironic twist, even 
poor peasant households are not afraid of the penalty, they dare 
give birth because they don't have any money anyway to pay the 
fine. This is another aspect of the difficulties the family 
planning reward-penalty system finds in the rural areas today. 
  Peasants who have no money to pay the fine have no reason to 
be afraid of any penalty; this group of poor peasants in fact is 
a product of the developing market economy. When penalty is 
imposed on these peasants for breaking the family planning 
rules, they would invariably resort to tactics of "running wild, 
cheating, denying, or running away." Relying on such tactics, 
some having no qualm or fear of excess birth would, in complete 
equanimity, simply say that "having no money to pay, [I'd] have 
a life instead"; some would move [their possessions] to homes of 
friends and relatives so that the cadre inspector, seeing they 
hardly have a wok to cook in, could not in good conscience levy 
the fine; some would delay paying the fine, offering up a few 
yuan every six months, saying all the right things, and after 
three or four years, stop paying altogether; others would 
threaten their neighbors and create a scene in the village so 
the people dare not reveal that their poverty was make-believe; 
still others would utilize their relationships with friends and 
relatives to obtain their share of land for growing vegetables 
and building houses; and finally there are those who would 
simply move away and disappear completely. All these make it 
almost impossible for the planning reward-penalty system to 
fulfill its role. 
  Turning to the urban areas, because the businesses need to 
transform their operating system and enter into market 
competition, they need to completely reform the system of 
employment; with the "iron rice bowl" no longer intact, and a 
system of wages and bonuses set up in replacement, workers and 
enterprises have room to maneuver, and workers are free to move 
in response to market demands. Therefore, the penalty in the 
reward-penalty system which used to get workers "by the throat" 
as it were, no longer carries that threat, and family planning 
effectiveness correspondingly declines, and the at-one-time most 
effective reward-penalty system now finds itself mired in 
difficulties. 
  We should not treat lightly the fact that effectiveness of 
the family planning reward-penalty system has diminished in a 
market economy, because to do so can revive the workers' desire 
for two or more children and, in time, lead to a backlash 
against family planning in the cities. This is particularly 
true for townships and villages below the county level. [passage

<F P=106> [Article: There Exists Quality Problems Worthy of Note in </F>
Importing Fertilizer--Liaoning Provincial Commodity Inspection 
Bureau Makes Suggestions to Relevant Sectors] 
  [Text] According to information obtained from the Liaoning 
Provincial Bureau of Commidity Inspections, it is known that 
last year a total of six kinds of fertilizer was imported into 
the province through the port of Dalian in 32 batches, weighing 
a total of 726,100 tons, worth $123,176,100. Checked against 
standards specified by the bureau for imported chemical 
fertilizer, these shipments posed the following quality control 
problems: 
  The first problem was the large proportion of shipments not 
meeting standards. In 1993, of a total of 32 batches of chemical 
fertilizer weighing a total of 726,100 tons, five batches 
weighing a total of 165,369 tons, worth $29,536,800, were found 
not to meet standards. On the basis of weight, 22.77 percent of 
the imported chemical fertilizer was substandard. 
  Second was a serious problem with shipment batches. For 
example, the fertilizer imported through Dalian from the United 
States was chiefly ammonium phosphate in 125 batches weighing a 
total of 611,020 tons. After inspection by the Liaoning 
Provincial Bureau of Commercial Inspection, three batches, 
weighing a total of 110,518 tons, which comprised 18.9 percent 
of the total weight, were found to be substandard. The nitrogen 
content of one batch was only 17.76 percent (contract 
requirement was 18 percent). In another two batches, the 
moisture content exceeded that of contract specifications. At 
the same time, two batches of a triple calcium phosphate mix, 
imported from the United Kingdom and weighing a total of 54,851 
tons, worth a total of $10,411,700, were also found to be 
substandard after checking by the Bureau of Commercial 
Inspection. In one batch, the amount of free acids was found to 
exceed specifications, and in another batch, the granular size 
also did not meet requirements -- a 100 percent noncompliance. 
On the shipments described above that did not meet contract 
specifications, the Liaoning Bureau of Commercial Inspection 
issued certificates of noncompliance, so that the parties 
concerned may seek compensation from their foreign suppliers. 
  With respect to the problem of quality in chemical 
fertilizers imported through the port of Dalian last year, 
related offices in the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Commercial 
Inspection has the following suggestions: 
  1. All agencies dealing with poor quality fertilizers 
imported from abroad must seek compensation from their foreign 
suppliers on the basis of the signed certificate issued by the 
Bureau of Commercial Inspection attesting to the problem, so 
they can recover their economic losses and protect the state's 
well-being. 
  2. In the future, in accordance with state regulations and 
international custom, all units engaged in importing chemical 
fertilizers must state in detail in the formal contract they 
sign with their foreign suppliers, the type of chemical 
fertilizer ordered, its requirements for product composition, 
quality, weight, and packaging, a statement for payment for 
damages, a penalty clause, and a disagreement clause. Otherwise, 
if the contract is unclear and not comprehensive, once the 
fertilizer imported is found not to meet specifications, there 
is no way to seek compensation from the foreign supplier. This 
may even cause the state undeserved economic loss. 
  3. All units engaged in importing chemical fertilizers must 
check for substandard products according to contract 
specifications, so that timely action can be taken--what batches 
to reject, what batches to negotiate for a lower price, what 
batches need to be replaced, and what batches call for 
compensation. 
  4. User households everywhere that purchase imported 
fertilizer should check for the certificate or stamp of approval 
given by the Bureau of Commercial Inspection on the product. It 
is quite possible that all products without the stamp or 
certificate of approval may be imitations. Users must be on the 
alert for being deceived. 
  5. After the imported chemical fertilizer has been received, 
all receiving units must petition the Bureau of Commercial 
Inspection for certification that the product meets 
specifications before it can be sold for subsequent use. If the 
inspection is not made in time, and a quality problem is later 
found, it may be impossible to recover damages because the time 
limit has expired. What is worse may be the great economic loss 
suffered by the user.

  [Summary] During the 1993-1994 pressing season Guangxi 
provided 19,500,000 tons of raw material to sugar mills, and 
produced 2,160,000 tons of sugar. Since 1988, the State Council 
has allocated 20 million yuan every year to Guangxi for the 
development of sugarcane. In 1984, the regional government set 
up the "Guangxi Sugar Company," which is responsible for 
sugarcane and sugar output. Every year the company allocates 
1,900,000 yuan to support sugarcane output, and has set up 18 
base counties for sugarcane production. In 1994 Guangxi will 
provide 1,800,000 tons of sugar for export.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Feng Zhaoying (7458 0340 5391) </F>
Deputy Chief, Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Water 
Conservancy: "World Water Day"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] At the present time, what kind of water resource 
problems still exist in Heilongjiang Province? How will they 
affect our province's development? 
  [Feng] There are four kinds of problems facing water 
resources in our province. First is the relatively low volume of 
water resources. Second is the imbalance in the time and space 
distribution of these water resources. Third is serious 
pollution affecting water quality. Finally, is the low capacity 
available to exert control of water resources on a broader scale. 
  For many years, the average annual precipitation has 
measured 531.4 mm, 18 percent lower than the national average, 
and placing Heilongjiang 25th among 30 provinces, cities and 
regions. The total volume of water resources in Heilongjiang is 
77.2 billion cubic meters, which translates into 2,180 cubic 
meters per capita, 520 cub meters lower than the per capita 
amount nationally. The acreage share of water per mu is only 
one-third of that per mu nationwide. Rainfall and runoff during 
the year are concentrated in the months June through September, 
comprising 60 percent to 80 percent of the annual precipitation, 
which leads to easy flooding. Since rainfall during June is less 
than 10 percent of the annual total, a spring drought frequently 
occurs. Water distribution is concentrated mostly in hilly 
areas, which is 74.5 percent of the total precipitation. While 
only 25.5 percent of the water resources is located in the 
plains where 80 percent of the cultivated land in the province 
is found, one can see how the arrangement between water and land 
resources is extremely illogical. The quality of natural water 
in Heilongjiang is very good, except it is seriously polluted by 
humans. Rivers where the pollution is more serious include the 
Sunghuajiang, Mudanjiang, Tangwanghe, Musuhe, Ashihe, Anbanghe 
etc. It is now possible to regulate and control surface runoff 
in Heilongjiang at 7 billion cubic meters. In comparison with 
Jilin and Liaoning Provinces, this scale of control is far lower 
than theirs. Moreover, Heilongjiang's effort is a preliminary 
development phase, which depends chiefly on natural runoff. 
These problems seriously inhibit Heilongjiang's economy and the 
improvement in living conditions of its inhabitants. 
  [Reporter] What measures and practices has Heilongjiang 
adopted to strengthen the management of these water resources? 
  [Feng] Heilongjiang places great importance on management of 
the province's water resources. In 1988, after the "PRC Water 
Law" had been promulgated, Heilongjiang's People's Provincial 
Assembly passed "Implementation of the `PRC Water Law,'" and the 
provincial CPC committee and provincial government issued 
"Identification of Several Problems on Strengthening Water 
Conservation Construction Projects." Following this, the 
provincial government further established a means to implement 
this "identification." The appearance of a series of regulations 
and policy statements issued by the provincial CPC, the 
provincial assembly, and the provincial government on following 
the law regarding water control and flood prevention, 
comprehensive management of water resources, mobilizing all 
elements in society to participate in water conservation, to 
strengthen water conservation-based industries and turn around 
the passive economic development that had resulted from sluggish 
buildup of irrigation and water conservancy projects. 
  To logically open up and effectively protect the water 
resources in Heilongjiang, we must start with basic tasks by 
initiating an overall survey and evaluation of the whole 
province's water resources. We must classify water resources by 
river basin and cities/towns; investigate and evaluate 
underground water resources for those towns suffering water 
shortages; and make a present status survey of water resources 
being tapped and used. Based on the needs of the "Water Law," 
Heilongjiang will organize water administrative teams overseeing 
water use compliance, and their authority will extend all the 
way down to the village level to locate and deal with cases 
flouting the water conservation law. Supported by the court in 
some localities, special water conservation courts may be set up. 
  To strengthen the unified management of water resources, we 
must implement a plan for economic use of water. Within the 
province, the plan must cover tapping of water directly from 
rivers, lakes, and underground sources, implementing a permit 
system for water extraction where "water extraction permits" are 
issued by water administration agencies at various levels, and 
collecting a water resource fee. 
  [Reporter] What engineering projects will the province 
consider in the next step? 
  [Feng] For several years Heilongjiang has invested 
considerable sums to build several irrigation and water 
conservation projects. Among them are 69 large and small-size 
reservoirs controlling a total volume of 7 billion meters of 
water. Add to this the engineering project diverting water from 
the Nunjiang, and a series of water conservation items in the 
Sanjiang area--all of which are having an impact on development 
in Heilongjiang. However, these already-built projects cannot 
meet present needs. In accordance with the spirit of 
"Identifying Several Problems on Strengthening Water 
Conservation Construction Projects," issued by the provincial 
CPC and the provincial government, new construction and 
expansion, and safety maintenance will involve 14 large and 
mid-size reservoirs, which will increase the capacity to control 
surface water to more than 10 billion cubic meters. The 
importance of the Nierji, Qinglongshan, and other reservoirs in 
the planning stage right now is to increase the capacity to 
control the water volume in some of the important rivers in the 
province to meet the needs of agricultural production along both 
river shorelines, and thereby stimulate economic development in 
these areas.

Sciences: "How Do China's Rural Finances March Toward Market 
Economy"] 
  [Text] I 
  The structural changes and the high-speed development of 
China's rural economy during the 1980s have created a huge 
market of demand and a large activity space for the development 
of rural banking industry. China will soon enter the GATT, and 
our banking industry will soon encounter tremendous outside 
pressure. As far as the opening up modern rural financial 
undertakings is concerned, this all means challenges as well as 
rare opportunities: 
  1. According to figures revealed by the State Statistics 
Bureau, the per capita saving of a peasant household was only 
7.05 yuan in 1978, a mere 5 percent of the per capita net income 
in that year. As of 1991, the per-capita saving of a peasant 
household had reached 271.91 yuan, accounting for 38 percent of 
the per capita net income in that year. If we take savings as a 
kind of financial asset, we can clearly see the upward trend of 
the percentage of a peasant's financial asset to the net income 
in each year. The growth of the peasants' financial asset shows 
that peasants are able to save more after their income 
increases. This is also a requirement for the development of 
modern banking industry in the countryside. In conducting an 
aggregate economic analysis, Western macro-economists often 
state that "savings are equivalent to investments." However, 
savings need an effective media to become investments. That 
media is the financial system composed of modern financial 
organizations and the money market. Nevertheless, the functions 
of the existing financial organizations in China are not so 
perfect. It is difficult for these organizations to play their 
role well in doing financing. When we carried out investigations 
in the rural areas during the past few years, we often found 
that some peasant families often keep tremendous amounts of cash 
locked in boxes at home. This situation is closely related to 
the slow development of the rural banking industry in China. 
  2) The rapid development of various rural industries and the 
vigorous rural economic activities to become market-oriented 
have greatly increased economic contacts and rapidly expanded 
the business of settling accounts in the same and in different 
areas. Right now the existing financial institutions are weak in 
settling accounts, the account-settling procedure is 
complicated, and there is endless carping and countless taboos 
in this connection. Methods used to settle accounts are also 
backward. On top of all this, the range of services provided by 
the financial institutions remains narrow. Their efficiency is 
quite low, and services are poor. As a result, many rural 
economic entities often use cash in business transactions, thus 
aggravating the situation wherein money is being circulated 
outside the bank. This kind of situation has not only increased 
the risk of the financial institutions in money circulation and 
their cost in settling accounts, but also made them lack of 
short-term loans. From the macro-economic point of view, it is a 
tremendous financial loss. 
  3) The contradiction between supply and demand of long-term 
capital in rural areas is becoming sharper and sharper in each 
passing day. The rural long-term capital includes social capital 
(roads, water supply and drainage channels, electric power and 
other infrastructural facilities) and industrial capital. The 
experiences at home and abroad show that it usually takes more 
than 10 years to accumulate long-term funds in support of social 
capital and that it also takes more than one year to accumulate 
medium and long-term funds in support of industrial capital. 
With the further development of the rural economy, the demand 
for long-term capital is becoming greater and greater. Due to 
the fact that China's market for long-term capital is nearly a 
blank, right now we can only fill this gap by relying on the 
various irregular flexible measures adopted in various 
localities for the supply of long-term capital such as raising 
social funds and soliciting public assistance and donations. The 
supply of such funds is unstable. In addition, the cost in 
raising funds in such way remains high. It is far insufficient 
to satisfy the requirements in developing China's economy. As a 
result, the contradiction between the supply and demand of the 
long-term capital is becoming sharper and sharper. 
  4) Impact from China's re-entry into GATT and opportunities 
to become export-oriented. If negotiations are carried out 
normally, China is expected to return to GATT (hereinafter 
referred to as "China's re-entry to GATT"). The "Uruguay Round" 
of talks -- the eighth round of multilateral GATT trade talks -- 
had entered the final stage since its inception in September 
1986. The service trade agreement of the Uruguay Round (draft of 
the final agreement) had stipulated the detail provisions on the 
five aspects of market access, national treatment, market 
transparency, most-favored nation status and the special 
treatments to developing countries. In order to develop China's 
banking industry, we must earnestly deal with the following 
issues: 
  A) Exclusion clause for suppliers of financial services. 
Those financial institutions owned or controlled by the 
government which mainly execute government functions or carry 
out activities for the government should not provide financial 
services. Therefore, China's current system of financial 
institutions with state-run banks, insurance companies and 
securities companies as its main entities will encounter serious 
institutional obstacles when it faces competitions from the 
international banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT. 
  B) The right to go into business (business involvement). 
Each participating nation should give providers of financial 
services of other participating nations the right to set up 
offices in its own country to offer the same type of financial 
services. 
  C) New financial service. It is the type of financial 
service that none of the financial service providers is offering 
in a specific participating nation except it is being offered in 
one participating nation. The latter should permit the financial 
service providers of other participating nations to offer new 
financial services in any form within its boundaries. In view of 
the tremendous differences in the form of shipment and delivery 
used by China's existing financial institutions in providing 
financial services, the provision on a participating nation's 
obligation to provide new financial services will create a 
strong shock wave on China's banking industry. 
  D) National treatment. Each participating nation should 
permit other participating nations' financial service providers 
which have already set up offices in its boundaries to contact 
the disbursement and account-settling departments of this 
participating nation for access to the supply of government 
funds by refinancing through the regular commercial channel. 
Foreign financial service providers should be given equal 
treatments as their domestic counterparts in seeking membership 
of financial organizations and participating in any institution 
which has the rights to formulate its own rules and regulations, 
in securities or futures exchanges, and in account-settling 
organs or other organizations or associations. Moreover, when a 
nation gives direct or indirect special privileges or treatments 
to its own financial institutions in rendering financial 
services, the foreign financial institutions in the country 
should also enjoy the same privileges and treatments. With 
regard to the aforementioned mandatory clause, we naturally may 
gradually reduce the various restrictions which conflict with 
GATT rules in accordance with the special GATT preferential 
treatments to developing nations, while protecting our own 
financial institutions to a certain extent and within a limited 
period of time. However, China's re-entry into GATT will 
undoubtedly have a great impact on China's banking industry. It 
will put pressure on us, while providing us with a motivational 
force. Whether or not we can seize the opportunities, meet the 
challenges, turn the pressure into a motive force, the key lies 
in our efforts to deepen our financial reform, open our banking 
industry wider to the outside world and increase our 
competitiveness in the world market. 
<H8>  II </H8>
  While we are faced with the aforementioned market changes in 
rural economy and the tremendous challenges and opportunities 
given us by China's chance to re-enter GATT, our rural banking 
industry deplorably fails to keep pace with this situation. 
Signs are manifested as follows: 
  1) Monopolistic short-term money market and backward methods 
for financing. As far as the whole country is concerned, the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank 
of China and the rural credit cooperatives under its 
administration, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank of 
China and the Bank of Communications are the only national banks 
in China that have branches all over the country; and can accept 
deposits directly from the residents, serve various economic 
entities in settling accounts and extend loans to financial 
institutions which need money. Only they can handle "real 
banking businesses." Although the functions of the 
aforementioned five banks somewhat overlap each other since the 
development of the reform program, their monopoly in the realm 
of production is still not broken down. The 180,000 odd 
financial institutions which emerged in the 1980's had 
preliminarily shattered the monopoly of a single bank in the use 
of funds, but they have not become effective competitors of the 
specialized banks in China's banking industry, since they only 
have a few branches and they are short of capital. They cannot 
accept deposits. Nor can they settle accounts or build vaults. 
In the rural areas, the Agricultural Bank of China and the rural 
credit cooperatives under its administration have still 
monopolized the rural banking industry. As a result, the methods 
for financing in the rural district is still far behind the 
world advanced level. If we view China's entire banking 
industry, its standard is equivalent to that of the developed 
nations in the 1950's. If it is said that there is a gap between 
China's industry and that of the developed nations, then there 
is even wider gap between China's banking industry and that of 
the developed nations. Other direct consequences of the monopoly 
of the banking industry are less service items and poor service 
quality. 
  2) The long-term money market is nearly a blank. It badly 
needs development. According to our survey, long-term financing 
activities in China's rural areas are limited to loans between 
close relatives and good friends for the building of rural 
residential houses. Here, there are no modern financial 
institutions. Factors of the money market such as the interest 
rate, mortgage, equity and credit period are non-existent. This 
situation is no doubt a considerable obstacle to the 
accumulation of long-term capital needed to further develop the 
rural economy. 
  3) Weak, ineffective and insufficient number of 
nongovernmental financial institutions. In China's rural area, a 
group of nongovernmental market-oriented financial institutions 
have emerged in the course of developing the market economy 
during the past 13 years. These financial institutions have 
satisfied, to a certain extent, the needs of the rural money 
market at various levels and counteracted the weaknesses of the 
aforementioned monopolistic financial institutions in the supply 
of funds for the development of market economy in rural 
districts. Nevertheless, these nongovernmental financial 
institutions share common weaknesses of relatively incompetent 
personnel, insufficient of capital and backward methods for 
financing. The current state of affairs shows that it will be 
difficult to rely on the existing nongovernmental financial 
institutions to meet the challenges and competitions from the 
world banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT. 
Specifically speaking, China's major nongovernmental rural 
financial institution -- the Rural Cooperative Foundation --has 
made remarkable progress. However, its capital was only 10 
billion yuan by the end of 1991, a fraction of the 300 billion 
yuan deposits in the Agricultural Bank of China. Moreover, it 
receives serious internal administrative inferences. Its rules 
and regulations are far from being perfect, and its management 
needs improvement. Meanwhile, private money houses, credit 
unions and other nongovernmental financial organizations are 
still sporadic, and they score little progress because of their 
traditional practices. 
<H8>  III </H8>
  In order to bring about changes to turn China's rural 
economy into a modern market economy and increase China's 
competitiveness in the world market, we should reform the rural 
banking industry as follows: 
  1. We must resolutely break down the monopoly in China's 
banking industry, encourage competitions in the financial sector 
and vigorously develop modern nongovernment financial 
institutions. Under the macroeconomic guidance of the state 
financial policy, we must cultivate multi-level financial 
organizations in various economic sectors, draw on the advanced 
experience of foreign countries, adopt a series of feasible 
measures against financial monopoly in the banking industry, and 
encourage and safeguard competitions among various types of 
financial institutions. The major task of the governments at the 
central and provincial levels is to develop a group of modern 
financial institutions that may compete in the international 
market. Due to the requirement for high technology and 
professionally trained personnel in the development of a modern 
banking industry, one of the realistic measures is to encourage 
those staff members who had left the existing state-run 
financial institutions or those who returned from their studies 
abroad to set up or lead new financial institutions. The related 
departments and governments at all levels must work hard to 
create a good external environment for this type of new 
financial institution. The state financial administrative 
departments may also set different standards for modern 
financial organizations and encourage them to further improve 
themselves through competition. Meanwhile it is necessary to 
clearly define the government's function in working out 
financial policies and its function in the control of financial 
institutions; and adequately separate these two functions. The 
former is mainly aimed at harmonizing the relation between 
economic development and the money supply, stabilizing the value 
of money and controlling where to put the money is use. The 
latter is mainly aimed at guiding the financial institutions, 
developing modern financial organizations, helping them become 
more competitive and promoting and safeguarding fair 
competitions in the banking industry. 
  2. We must vigorously form and develop the long-term money 
market. Since the beginning of the 1990's, China had made 
preliminary breakthroughs in doing direct financing. The 
securities market had gradually grown out of nothing and opened 
up a new path for raising long-term capital. From now on, we 
must study and find new ways on how to channel the money in the 
securities market to rural areas. 
  In the course of developing the long-term money market, we 
must pay particular attention to the role of the insurance 
industry. Generally speaking, the insurance companies sign 
insurance contracts with their clients who wish to guard against 
any contingency. They collect a fixed amount of insurance 
premiums from their clients, and pay indemnities according to 
the contract when the specified accident occurs. The insurance 
companies use this method to provide their clients with 
financial assets. At the same time, they keep the premiums they 
receive as reserve funds to pay indemnities in case something 
happens. In general, they have a considerable amount of money on 
hand. As a result, the insurance companies which are the main 
suppliers of industrial funds often play an important role on 
the securities market. This is particularly true in the realm of 
life insurance. The insurance companies are able to use modern 
technology to accurately predict the rate of mortality. Also, 
the insurance contracts they sign with their clients are usually 
extra long-term ones. Therefore, their capital is relatively 
long-term and stable. Life insurance, as the main body in the 
supply of long-term funds, plays a significant role in the 
long-term money market. The figures provided by the State 
Statistics Bureau indicate that insurance premiums in China grew 
from 2.57 billion yuan in 1985 to 20.97 billion yuan in 1991, 
with an average annual growth rate of 41.9 percent. Its old-age 
pension insurance premiums grew from 180 million yuan in 1987 to 
3.31 billion yuan in 1991 with an average annual growth rate of 
62.5 percent. The percentage of the old-age pension insurance 
premiums in the entire amount of premiums collected also rose 
from 6.9 percent in 1985 to 15.8 percent in 1991. The 
departments of civil affairs in various localities have also 
enthusiastically encouraged people to buy rural social old-age 
pension insurance. Right now, more than 800 counties (cities and 
districts) in China have carried out experiments in selling 
rural social old-age pension insurance policies. More than seven 
million peasants have underwritten the old-age pension 
insurance. This situation indicates that the insurance industry, 
particularly the old-age pension insurance which is the main 
long-term money supply already has a good start in China. It is 
expected to grow rapidly. The next step is how to tackle the 
issue of guarding against monopoly and safeguard competition and 
how to turn the insurance funds into long-term capital. 
  3. We must promote the modernization of the banking industry 
and further improve technologies in this connection. We should 
draw on the advanced experience of the banking industry abroad. 
To speed up the process of making full use of the foreign 
advanced banking technologies, we urgently need to carry out the 
following tasks: 
  A) We must establish a modernized system for settling 
accounts. 
  B) We must set up a modernized mortgage system and improve 
the relevant organizations. 
  C) We must reform the system of loan administration, and 
use, wherever possible, the method of bill discount and that of 
bill rediscount by the Central Bank for extending short-term 
loans. Some of the major issues which have plagued China's 
banking industry are the fact that it is difficult to control 
where to actually use the credit funds and the misappropriation 
of funds. If we extend short-term loans by mainly relying on the 
method of bill discount, we would be able to solve, to a great 
extent, the headache in our banking industry. 
  D) We must accelerate the process of computerizing the 
banking industry. 
  In short, China is a developing nation with a shortage of 
capital. To maintain sustained and steady economic growth, we 
will have to rely, to a great extent and for a long time to 
come, on our family savings. How to effectively and smoothly 
turn family savings into social and industrial capital. Making 
the best use of our rare sources of capital (in different 
regions, different industries and different enterprises) is the 
unshirkable historic responsibility of China's banking industry 
for rejuvenating our nation.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Xucai (3769 4872 2088), chief of the </F>
provincial agricultural bureau: "Implement Policies To Increase 
Investment and Reap a Bumper Harvest in 1994"] 
  [Text] The agricultural and rural economic situation of 
Guizhou Province was good in 1993. Improvements involved 
increases in the gross value of agricultural output, a new 
record in the history of grain production, 15 continuous years 
of development in animal husbandry, accelerated development in 
aquatic and reclamation undertakings, and a higher per-capita 
net income for peasants. 
  The gross value of agricultral output reached 17.66 billion 
yuan (based on 1990 constant prices), an increase of 4.1 percent 
over 1992. The per-capita income of peasants reached 579 yuan, 
an increase of 73 yuan over that of 1992. 
  Total grain output was 8.695 million tons, an increase of 
10.2 percent over 1992, of which summer grain was 1.695 million 
tons, an increase of 1.3 percent and fall grain was 7 million 
tons, an increase of 12.6 percent. Total cash crop output of 
flue-cured tobacco was 507,900 tons, an increase of 13.1 percent 
and rape seeds was 384,000 tons, a decrease of 23.1 percent. 
Tea leaves totalled 142,000 tons, an increase of 2 percent over 
1992. 
  In animal husbandry, the number of live hogs increased 0.6 
percent as compared to that of 1992 and the number of 
slaughtered hogs increased by 2.2 percent. The number of live 
draft animals increased 1.4 percent and the number of sold draft 
animals increased 21.9 percent. The output of meat and milk all 
increased markedly as compared to that of 1992. 
  The output of aquatic products was 25,000 tons, an increase 
of 8.2 percent over 1992. The total industrial and agricultural 
output value of farmland reclamation undertakings was 76 million 
yuan, an increase of 8.2 percent. The amount of taxes paid by 
these enterprises was 5.8 million yuan, an increase of 9.3 
percent over 1992. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, and 
reclamation industries of Guizhou Province has made considerable 
progress, and the output of grain, oil-bearing crops, tobacco, 
and animal products has increased steadily. Grain production 
set an all-time high in 1993. Judging the 15 years of reform 
and opening up, the achievements can be attributed to four basic 
reasons: 1) Rural areas have implemented the output-related 
contract responsibility system, liberating productive forces and 
arousing farmers' enthusiasm for production. 2) The market and 
prices of most farm and animal products have been decontrolled, 
stimulating the development of production. 3) Party committees 
and government organs at all levels have paid great attention to 
agriculture and formulated and adopted a series of effective 
policies and measures. 4) The primary productive force of 
science and technology has also been brought into play. 
  Currently, agricultural work faces quite a number of new 
situations and problems. Mainly they involve one transfer, two 
changes and three weaknesses. The one transfer is that the 
three elements of agricultural production are being transferred 
from agricultural to non-agricultural departments. Cultivated 
land is shrinking every year; strong labor is being transformed; 
and agricultural funds continue to flow out. Two changes are: 
1) Agriculture is changing from a planned economy to a socialist 
market economy. 2) Traditional agriculture is changing toward a 
high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. The 
three weaknesses are: 1) The system is incomplete. 2) The 
macroeconomic regulation and control ability is weak. 3) The 
infrastructure of agriculture is poor. To continue the 
excellent situation in agriculture, we should thoroughly 
understand these issues, study solutions and adopt measures so 
as to achieve the steady development of agriculture. 
  To implement the guidelines of the Central Rural Work 
Conference and the Rural Work Conference of the Provincial CPC 
Committee and to reap a bumper harvest this year, agricultural 
departments must give full play to their advisory role and 
technological advantage and actively cooperate with party and 
government organs at all levels to advance and work toward 
fulfilling the task of agricultural production for 1994. To 
fulfill all of 1994 plans--18.34 billion yuan of total 
agricultural output value, 8.75 million tons of total grain 
output, 340,000 tons of flue-cured tobacco, 500,000 tons of 
rapeseeds, 18,000 tons of tea leaves, 7.15 million heads of live 
draft animals, 14.3 million heads of live hogs, 915,000 tons of 
total meat product, 55,000 tons of eggs, 13,000 tons of milk and 
26,000 tons of aquatic products--the Guizhou Provincial 
Agricultural Bureau set forth the following guidelines, focuses, 
and main measures for agricultural work in 1994. 
  1. Basic guidelines are: being market-oriented, science and 
technology driven and efficiency-conscious; aiming to increase 
peasants' income, rationalizing the distribution of resources, 
readjusting and optimizing the agricultural structure and 
guaranteeing the steady increase for grain production. Great 
efforts should be made to develop the production of "grocery 
basket," vigorously promote high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture, increase the comprehensive 
production ability of agricultural departments, and accelerate 
the continuous agricultural development in Guizhou Province. 
  2. Production focuses are as follows: 1) Grain production. 
Steadily increasing grain output is an important task for 
agricultural production in Guizhou Province. In accordance with 
the requirements for stabilizing acreage, optimizing structure, 
improving variety, and focusing on per-mu yield, Guizhou 
Province should keep seeded areas at or above 40 million mu and 
concentrate on enforcing production, technology, and management 
measures to ensure growth in production. 2) Production of 
dominant cash crops and name-brand quality products. Flue-cured 
tobacco and rape are two main cash crops of Guizhou Province. 
They are main sources of revenue for the province and provide 
income for the peasants. As far as flue-cured tobacco is 
concerned, Guizhou Province mainly needs to stick to planned 
cultivation, concentrate on quality, and increase per-mu yield 
and economic returns. Using regionalized and restricted 
cultivation and coordinating improved variety with quality 
methods, rapeseed production should follow the principle of 
using sales as a criterion and incentive for production and 
concentrating efforts on developing quality rape and increase 
economic returns. The development of name-brand quality farm 
products is an important measure for increasing the economic 
returns for agriculture. Rice production should focus on 
developing superior rice, black glutinous rice, and fragrant 
rice. Great efforts should be made to develop the variety of 
corn that has high content of protein and lysine, expand the 
production of name-brand quality tea and fruit, and increase the 
ability to earn foreign exchange and compete on the market. 3) 
The production of "grocery basket." It is necessary to increase 
the output of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and aquatic products to 
enrich the "grocery basket" of the masses of people. The focus 
of animal husbandry, the breeding industry and the farm 
reclamation industry is to steadily develop the production of 
live hogs, vigorously develop plant-eating animals, increase the 
ratio of beef, mutton, and poultry in meat, and make great 
efforts to promote fish breeding in rice paddy, ponds, and 
netted boxes to increase the per-capita output of aquatic 
products. 
  3. Main measures are: To fulfill agricultural production 
tasks in an all-round way for 1994, Guizhou Province needs to do 
a good job mainly in the following areas: 
  A. Implement "Law of Agriculture" and "Law for Promotion of 
Agricultural Technology" and increase supervision for law 
enforcement. Since their promulgation, government and 
agricultural organs at all levels have made great efforts to 
publicize and enforce the above two laws. However, judging from 
the current situation, publicity and enforcement are still 
inadequate. In addition to agricultural departments making 
further efforts we should, in accordance with the demand of 
popularizing the legal system and under the leadership of 
people's congress and government organs at all levels, make 
greater efforts to publicize and enforce the above two laws to 
ensure that there are laws to follow and rules to apply in 
agricultural work. 
  B. Readjust and optimize the industrial structure of 
agriculture. Since the reform and opening up, the agricultural 
structure of Guizhou Province has been changing continuously. 
Judging from the composition of gross agricultural output value 
in 1978 and 1992, the crop planting industry has declined by 14 
percentage points, animal husbandry increased by 11.6 percentage 
points, and fishery increased by 0.3 percentage points. The 
readjustment of agricultural structure should be focused on the 
development of animal husbandry, aquatic breeding, high-return 
cash crops, forestry, orchards, township enterprises, and rural 
sideline production. To readjust the structure of the 
crop-planting industry we should, under the prerequisite of 
guaranteeing the steady increase of grain production, vigorously 
promote the diversified economy, and develop in light of local 
conditions, garden products such as tea, mulberry, fruits, and 
herbs for medicine. Steadily increasing autumn grain, we should 
speed up the production of summer grain and continue to increase 
the ratio of summer grain to the total grain output. 
  To readjust the structure of animal husbandry, we should 
mainly proceed from the characteristic that Guizhou Province has 
both farm and meadow type animal husbandry, steadily develop the 
production of live hogs pursuant to market demand, vigorously 
develop cattle, sheep, and rabbits, accelerate the development 
of poultry, and gradually establish a mix of animals which help 
save grain, eat grass, and can be sold as commodities. At the 
same time, we should also develop the sources of famous and 
precious brands such as fragrant pigs and ducks and special 
kinds of cash animals. The focus of live hog production is to 
increase the slaughter and commodity rates and develop the 
production of hogs with lean meat. Plant-eating animals should 
be focused mainly on cattle and sheep to increase the ratio of 
beef, mutton, and poultry in meat. The aquatic industry needs 
to mainly promote fish breeding in suburban areas and rice 
fields, vigorously develop netted box fishery, concentrate on 
per-mu yield, develop famous, special, and quality aquatic 
products, and increase the ratio of high-quality aquatic 
products. 
  C. Accelerate the construction of bases for commodity 
production and carry out various agricultural projects. 
  Commodity production bases are concentrated in one area and 
connected to one another. Their production and management are 
on a fairly large scale which is conducive to the popularization 
of technology. Such bases also have a high commodity rate, 
better investment returns, greater promotional effect, a clear 
demonstrative function, and the economy of scale. They are a 
good way to increase the productivity and commodity rate of 
agricultural products in Guizhou Province. In 1944, the 
crop-planting industry should mainly do a good job in 4 counties 
and cities which have been designated as commodity grain bases, 
including Bijie, 23 counties whose grain production is funded 
with special grain production funds, and 9 major grain producing 
counties which have applied for state assistance, including 
Zunyi. Efforts should be made to ensure a good job in the 
construction of bases for flue-cured tobacco, rape, and crop 
seeds. 
  Animal husbandry mainly needs to concentrate on three sets 
of 
12 projects. They are namely, 12 bases for commodity cattle 
(sheep), including Wuchuan and Zhijin, 12 bases for commodity 
hogs with lean meat, including Zunyi and Meitan, and 12 ensilage 
and ammoniation livestock breeding bases, including Wuchuan and 
Xiuwen. The output value of these bases should reach the scale 
of 100 million yuan. Fishery should mainly focus on building 
commodity fish bases in the suburbs of Guiyang and other cities 
to effectively increase the output of fish products. 
  Guizhou Province should continue to carry out throughout the 
province bumper harvest plans, the Spark Plan, high-yield 
demonstration projects, and other high-efficiency demonstration 
projects such as double key-link field, ton-grain field (soil), 
and double-thousand field. In 1994, efforts should be made to 
do a good job in the high-yield demonstration project of 500,000 
mu wheat field in seven counties including Xiuwen and Meitan and 
the high-yield demonstration project of 500,000 mu rape field in 
seven counties including Anshun and Xifeng. 
  D. Vigorously apply science and technology to agriculture 
and 
actively promote useful agricultural technology. 
  In 1994, the following useful agricultural technologies will 
be popularized. "Three hybrid varieties" will be popularized 
over a large area. Some 8.5 million mu of hybrid rice, 6.5 
million mu of hybrid corn, and 2 million mu of hybrid rape will 
be planted. Some 6.5 million mu of dryland will be planted 
using the multi-harvest rotational system. Some 4 million mu of 
hybrid rice will be cultivated using the leaf age pattern 
cultivation method. The technology for comprehensive 
improvement of soil for medium and low yield fields will be 
popularized. We should improve the soil for 500,000 mu of 
medium and low yield fields, plant 5.5 million mu of green 
manure crop, use the semi-dryland cultivation and comprehensive 
utilization technology to transform 800,000 mu of barren land, 
and to promote rational crop fertilizing technology. We should 
conduct soil test and use it as a basis for formulating 
fertilizer for 15 million mu, popularize trace element 
fertilizer for 3 million mu, and promote the comprehensive 
technology to prevent plant and animal diseases and insect 
pests. Plant disease prevention technology should be applied to 
over 80 percent of infected area, and over 70 percent of animals 
should be inoculated. The comprehensive hog-raising technique of 
"two promotion's and five reform's" should be applied to over 40 
percent of farms. With regard to the ensilage and ammoniation 
technique, Guizhou Province should have 300 million kg of 
compost made of ensiled and ammoniated straw and stalks. With 
regards to precision breeding and high yield fish breeding 
techniques, Guizhou Province should breed fish in 1.7 million mu 
of rice paddies, 500,000 mu of netted boxes, and 200,000 mu of 
high-density running water. 
  E. Stabilize and improve the agricultural technology 
promotion system and support the development of specialized 
service organizations run by local people. In view of the 
unstable condition of current agricultural technology promotion 
teams, we should do a good job mainly in the following areas: 
First, we should stabilize organizations and contingents in 
accordance with the guidelines of the National Agricultural Work 
Conference, adopt measures under the leadership of party and 
government organs at all levels to improve working and living 
conditions for agricultural technicians, and speed up the "three 
stability's" work of three stations in townships and towns. 
Second, beginning in 1993 the provincial treasury should set 
aside 3 million yuan each year for 3 consecutive years with 
matching contribution from prefectural and county treasury 
departments for use in the construction of "three stations" in 
townships and towns. All levels should do a good job in 
managing such funds to ensure fulfillment of construction tasks. 
Third, correct guidance should be given to agricultural and 
animal husbandry departments at all levels to establish service 
entities, increase service items, and enhance economic strength. 
Various kinds of associations run by the local people in rural 
areas, which are a reinforcement for socialized service of 
agriculture, are relatively weak in Guizhou Province. 
Agricultural and animal husbandry departments at all levels 
should do a good job in research in this area, conscientiously 
sum up experience, and vigorously encourage and support their 
development. 
  F. Cultivate and build an agricultural market system. In 
1994, focus should be placed on guiding and helping local 
development and circulation organizations, cultivating product 
market, and developing productive factors markets, enabling 
individual small production households to be linked to large 
markets and participate in market competition. The main methods 
are: 1) Increase the service function of rural economic 
organizations and encourage peasants to participate in 
circulation. 2) Develop organizations which integrate 
production, supply, marketing, breeding, planting, processing, 
trade, industry, and agriculture. 3) Use production bases and 
state-run farms and pastoral areas and township enterprises as a 
basis to organize production and marketing complexes. 4) 
Organize and build enterprise groups for pillar industries or 
products. On the basis of primary markets and centering around 
product markets, we should build a market system using fairs as 
its network, including various specialized and wholesale 
markets. With regards to the development of productive factors 
markets, we should focus on guiding the construction of money, 
labor, and technology markets. 
  G. Vitalize state-owned agricultural enterprises and 
vigorously develop the export-oriented economy. State-owned 
agricultural enterprises in Guizhou Province currently suffer 
from such problems as rigid management mechanisms, poor market 
adaptability, and low economic returns. The main measure to 
quickly improve such situations is to increase reform efforts, 
properly and fully utilize existing policies to increase 
management returns through the methods of leasing, renting, 
share-holding, and cooperation. Guizhou Province has made 
definite achievements in foreign economic relations in 
agriculture in recent years. It has established friendly 
relations and started technical and economic cooperation 
projects with over 20 countries and areas. Since the reform and 
opening up, Guizhou Province has absorbed and utilized over 200 
million yuan renminbi of foreign investment. In 1994, Guizhou 
Province will continue to absorb foreign investment and expand 
the scale of foreign fund utilization. 
  H. Make conscientious efforts to reduce peasants' burden. 
Guizhou Province has made definite achievements in this regard. 
In 1994, it will make further efforts to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of state and provincial documents 
regarding reducing peasants' burdens and ensure that peasants' 
legal rights are protected.

  [Summary] In 1994 the grain contract purchase amount is 
3.51 billion kilograms, and for rapeseeds 550 million kilograms; 
in addition Sichuan will purchase 2.5 billion kilograms of grain 
and 275 million kilograms of rapeseeds from the market. Sichuan 
will also concentrate on setting up grain reserves at the 
provincial, prefecture and county levels. In 1994 provincial 
reserves should total 750 million kilograms, and 250 million 
kilograms at the prefecture and county levels.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Yan (3769 1750): "Rising Trend of </F>
Heilongjiang Peasant Burdens Starting To Fall"] 
  [Text] We find the burdens assumed by Heilongjiang's 
peasants per capita are beginning to come down, after we had 
tackled the data this past year and straightened them out in a 
comprehensive way. According to an investigative survey of the 
province's 28 towns/counties and 224 villages, the total burden 
assumed by the province's peasants in 1993 averaged 81.64 yuan 
per capita, 17.95 yuan less per capita than last year, a drop of 
18 percentage points. The reasons for this drop are due chiefly 
to the following: 
  1) A drop in the tax load. In 1993, the taxes paid by 
Heilongjiang's peasants averaged 29.31 yuan per capita, 1.82 
yuan less than the 31.13 yuan per capita for the year before, a 
drop of 5.8 percentage points. Included in this is the 
agriculture tax of 26.36 yuan per capita, which also showed a 
drop of 1.3 percentage points over the year before. 
  2) A drop in collective retention. In 1993, Heilongjiang's 
peasants paid a retention fee of 28.75 yuan per capita, 4.90 
yuan less than the 33.82 yuan per capita for the year before, a 
drop of 14.5 percentage points. 
  3) A drop in the overall planning fee. In 1933, the overall 
planning fee assumed by Heilongjiang's peasants was 13.98 yuan 
per capita, 0.92 yuan less that 14.90 yuan per capita for the 
year before. Of this figure, 8.05 yuan per capita was earmarked 
for public and welfare benefits such as education, family 
planning, elderly pensions etc., 0.17 yuan less than that for 
the year before. 
  4) A 55.12 percent drop in the apportionment fee. In 1993, 
Heilongjiang's peasants paid 8.86 yuan per capita in 
apportionment fines, a reduction of 0.88 yuan per capita over 
last year's 9.74 yuan, a drop of 55.1 percentage points. Of 
this, an arbitrary apportionment fee of 0.63 yuan designated for 
peasant services dropped 43.2 percentage points over that 
allowed last year. 
  While a common effort by Heilongjiang's government at all 
levels to control the excessive tax burden assumed by its 
peasants obtained certain results, the responsibility faced by 
the government at all levels is still awesome. According to 
incomplete statistics, the provincial rural collective financial 
strength is still quite weak, with a per capita debt of 53,000 
yuan, and carrying loans [tai kuan 2127 2949] of 37,000 yuan per 
capita. This situation will necessarily slow down the drop in 
peasant burdens, and poses the hidden danger of increasing 
peasant burdens.

a meeting with circulation department leaders from Guandong, 
Guangxi, Yunnan, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, Sichuan 
and Liaoning, and the president of the Sugar and Alcohol 
Corporation in order to adopt swift and vigorous measures to 
stabilize sugar prices. 
  The government will immediately place some sugar reserves on 
the market to stabilize prices. Localities and enterprises will 
sell current sugar stocks to support a rational price level. 
The meeting decided to decrease the current spot price of 
first-grade granulated sugar from sugar-producing regions in the 
south from 3500-3600 yuan to 3000-3200 yuan per ton. 
  The government will put 300,000 tons of sugar reserves on 
the 
market. The amount of the first batch of reserves are: 
Shanghai 6,000 tons, Sichuan 7,000 tons, Tianjin 5,000 tons, 
Shandong 20,000 tons, Liaoning 10,000 tons, Beijing 10,000 tons, 
and Jiangsu 15,000 tons. The amount of the second batch of 
reserves will be based on the market situation.

Cheng Chang-yu (2052 4545 3842) in Taipei: "Taiwan Businessmen's 
Enthusiasm Unabated in Investing on Mainland" -- First Quarter 
Investments Totaling 314 Projects and Exceeding US$200 Million; 
Tientsin Is Among the Top Five Most Popular Areas"] 
  [Text] 
The enthusiasm of Taiwan's businessmen to invest in the mainland 
remains unabated. The Investment Commission of the Economics 
Ministry announced yesterday (7 May) that as of the end of the 
first quarter of 1994, more than 10,000 applications from 
Taiwan's businesses to invest in the mainland have been approved 
with the total amount of investments exceeding US$3.8 billion in 
value. Tientsin has, for the first time, squeezed itself into 
the top five most popular areas. Investments in the manufacture 
of basic metal products are expected to increase. 
  According to statistics announced by the Investment 
Commission yesterday, 314 projects for indirect investment in 
the mainland were approved by the government with a total amount 
of investments reaching US$246 million in value. This has 
brought the total number of approved projects, by the 
government, investing in the mainland to over 10,000 and the 
total amount of investments to US$3.836 billion. The 
investments are mainly made by Taiwan's businesses for the 
manufacture of electric and electronic products, plastic wares, 
food, beverages, precision machinery and basic metal products in 
the mainland. 
  The Investment Commission admitted that the statistics 
showed 
that Taiwan's businessmen's enthusiasm to invest in the mainland 
remained unabated. However, the government has adopted measures 
to cool off the across-Straits exchanges under the influence of 
the Chientaohu Incident. The April meeting to examine special 
cases involving investments in the mainland was called off. As 
for the schedule to resume this meeting, the Investment 
Commission said that it was a matter of policy and that it was 
waiting for further instructions. 
  The statistics compiled by the Investment Commission showed 
that Shanghai remained the most favorable spot on the mainland 
for Taiwan's businesses to make investments. Tungwan of 
Kwangtung ranked second; and Shenchen took third. For the first 
time, the city of Tientsin squeezed itself into the rankings to 
take fourth. Amoy ranked fifth. 
  A large amount of investments went to the manufacturing of 
basic metal products amounting to US$51.59 million in value. As 
for the number of projects, as many as 48 projects approved were 
in the manufacture of electric and electronic appliances and 
products. 
  Apparently the aforementioned figure announced by the 
Investment Commission sharply differs from the US$10 billion 
quoted by the mainland source as the total amount of Taiwan 
businessmen's investments there. The Investment Commission 
believes that the figure quoted by the mainland source may 
possibly include the amount of investments that the Taiwan 
businesses had preliminarily promised to make. As for the 
credibility of the figure revealed by the Investment Commission, 
the commission pointed out that since last year when Taiwan 
businesses with investments in the mainland were asked to 
register once again, the majority of them had complied with the 
request. Thus, the figures should be quite reliable. 
  However, an official of the Investment Commission pointed 
out: Many entrepreneurs with investments in the mainland have 
failed to register themselves for their mainland investments and 
their cases were reported to the authorities by other 
businessmen. Scores of such cases were handled by the 
Investment Commission. Huang Ching-tang, head of the 
commission, said that the commission will check and verify the 
cases. If they are found to be true, these entrepreneurs will 
be fined between 3 million and 15 million yuan in accordance 
with the Regulation on Relations Between Peoples Across the 
Straits.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Analyzing Current Economic Situation"] </F>
  [Text] The domestic economic situation has been abnormal 
since the beginning of the year. The general economic outlook to 
change for the better has not appeared. Hsueh Chi, Deputy 
Director of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, 
not long ago described the current economic situation as 
"strange." He pointed out the following four particular 
situations in the economic sphere at present. 
  (1) The global economy is gradually recovering, but our 
exports show no momentum. Our exports during the first quarter 
this year only registered a growth rate of 0.4 percent over the 
same period last year. Taiwan found itself trailing others among 
Asia's four little dragons. This was quite unusual. 
  (2) The export orders during the last quarter of 1993 posted 
an annual growth rate of 4.9 percent. It can often be used to 
predict the figure for the first quarter of this year. Although 
it was not high, it should be much better than the 0.4 percent 
rate of growth for the first quarter of 1994. 
  (3) The exports during the first quarter this year were at 
the lowest level since the third quarter of 1990, but the 
industrial production index rose 5.9 percent, which is the 
highest since 1992. If there are weaker demands abroad, how can 
our industrial production maintain a higher rate of growth? 
  (4) Our textile industry received 20 percent more export 
orders in March this year. If our textile mills, a large number 
of which had already moved out, can still receive more export 
orders, why are other industries less competitive? 
  If we carefully analyze the data regarding the four 
particular situations pointed out by Hsueh Chi, we will 
understand the reasons. 
  Let us take item two as an example. The growth rate of 
export 
orders is greater than that of actual exports. That was not 
something which only began from the first quarter of this year. 
It happened two years ago. This is apparently the result of 
orders being sent to Taiwan, while goods were shipped out from 
the mainland. 
  The third item is that Taiwan is still able to maintain a 
high rate of growth in industrial production, while there are 
less demands abroad. If we divide the manufacturing industry 
into two major categories -- the heavy industry and the light 
industry, our labor-intensive export industry belongs to light 
industry. The growth rate of light industry during the first 
quarter this year is merely 0.7 percent. Apparently this is the 
result of sluggish exports. However, the heavy industry 
registered a growth rate of 8.8 percent, which were mainly 
composed of products made of basic metal and nonmetallic mineral 
as well as petrochemical products mainly for the domestic 
market. Products of the first two categories are mainly related 
to major engineering and housing projects. That means the 
percentage of manufactured products for domestic consumption 
increased. 
  As for the fourth item, we must first understand how our 
textile industry is relocating its assembly lines out of Taiwan 
before we study the issue of why this industry of ours may 
register a high rate of growth in export orders. Most of the 
assembly lines of the labor-intensive dress and clothing 
industry have moved out, but only a limited number of cotton 
yarn manufacturing mills which need a great deal of capital are 
still in Taiwan. Most of them have improved their production 
quality and become automated. The relocation of the downstream 
processing industry has brought about the sustained growth in 
the export of cotton yarn. For example, the export of garments 
reached a peak of $4.4 billion in 1987, but dropped to $2.8 
billion in 1993, suffering a decline of $1.6 billion. However, 
the export of cotton yarn rose from $2.8 billion in 1987 to $7.4 
billion in 1993, marking an increase of $2.8 billion and far 
exceeding the decline in the garment export industry. The export 
of cotton yarn during the first quarter this year was 16.3 
percent higher than that of the same period last year. 
Therefore, the large increase in export orders for textile 
products is truly connected with the relocation of cotton mills. 
However, there is no doubt that the relocation of the downstream 
mills has caused the increase in exports for the upstream cotton 
yarn. 
  The issue concerning item one that the global economy is 
gradually recovering, but the fact that our exports show no 
momentum merits attention. In our 25 March editorial, entitled: 
"Seize the Opportunity of U.S. Economic Recovery To Create 
Better Achievements," we had issued a warning and reminded our 
businessmen in the textile industry of our need to increase the 
exports of some of our products which are still quite 
competitive in the U.S. market just like what we did about 10 
years ago when the United States was recovering from its 
economic recession. We had also analyzed the effects in 
relocating our labor-intensive industries in the past six to 
seven years. Such relocation has made the export of 
labor-intensive products such as garment and shoes decline on a 
large scale. However, our total volume of exports still 
registered an satisfactory growth despite the world economic 
slowdown. We discovered that there are two reasons for this. On 
the one hand, the trade effects caused by our investments abroad 
have driven up the exports of our production facilities, raw 
material and semi-finished products and parts from Taiwan, while 
on the other hand, businessmen in Taiwan have adjusted 
themselves well by investing more in the manufacture of 
technology-intensive products. Thus, in the past six years with 
the exception of 1990, double-digit growth was reported in the 
export of technology-intensive electronic components, computers, 
communication equipment, machinery, electric motors and means of 
transportation. Such growth not only makes up the decline in the 
export of labor-intensive products, but also helps maintain the 
appropriate growth in the total value of exports. In addition, 
it also helps rapidly readjust the industrial structure. 
However, during the first quarter in 1994 when the exports of 
labor-intensive products continuously dropped, the rate of 
growth in the export of technology-intensive products dropped to 
4 percent from its usual double-digit growth in the past six 
years. It only makes up the decline in the export of 
labor-intensive products, but fails to maintain the growth in 
the total value of exports. Why is that? We can study this issue 
from two different angles: 
  1. From the point of view of the supply, is it possible that 
lack of investments in the manufacturing industry has made the 
technology-intensive products less competitive in the export 
market and thus greatly lowered the growth rate? 
  2. If we analyze this issue from the point of view of 
demand, 
we find that in making investments abroad, particularly in the 
mainland, Taiwan has shifted from labor-intensive to capital- 
and technology-intensive manufacturing. When the factories are 
completed one after another, they would be able to produce some 
production facilities, parts and components and some types of 
raw materials themselves without having to import them from 
Taiwan. Would that cause an import-substitution effect? 
  If we cannot tackle this issue and make improvements in a 
timely manner, it would have an extremely adverse impact on 
Taiwan's current and future economic situation. If we fail to 
seize this favorable opportunity at a time when the world's 
economy is recovering, it is possible that Taiwan's ranking in 
exports will drop from the 12th to the 13th behind Korea or even 
to the 14th behind Singapore to find itself at the tail of 
Asia's four little dragons. Moreover, if Taiwan fails to 
maintain an adequate growth in exports, its trade may go from a 
surplus to a deficit under the pressure of the GATT entry. All 
this would shake our nation's strong position in handling 
economic affairs and trading in the world. This issue merits the 
attention of our highest authorities. They need to take 
immediate action to rectify this situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Nan Fangshuo (0589 2455 2592): "Go West? Go </F>
South? Official Policy Too Tangled To Unravel"] 
  [Text] In the 1990s, the situation of the entire 
Asia-Pacific region has on the whole changed, and the Chinese 
mainland and the six countries of the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations [ASEAN] have seemed determined to become the two 
great axes of the future economic order in Asia. Recently there 
has also been talk of the emergence of a number of secondary 
structures revolving around these two great axes, including 
various economic blocs and cooperative development plans. 
  So it is that at a time when the Asian economic system is 
entering into a period of reorganization, Taiwan, when it comes 
to key questions such as the orientation of its own role, and 
the place it will occupy in the future order, appears more and 
more confused. Therefore, mutual contradictions emerge from 
approaches such as suddenly "going south," suddenly "going 
west," or suddenly wanting to develop Hainan Island, and 
political and economic considerations become too tangled up to 
unravel. 
<H5>  "Going South" Means Losing a Great Deal and Receiving Scant </H5>
Benefits 
  The "southward policy" originated in March of last year, and 
its goal, in view of the fact that the enthusiasm of Taiwan 
businessmen for the mainland is on the ascendant, is to avoid 
vis-a-vis the mainland excessive reliance on political 
bargaining chips which can be lost, and successfully adopt a 
policy of distributed investment in Southeast Asia. In order to 
"go south," Taiwan is anxious to arrange investment guarantees 
with Southeast Asia countries and avoid dual tax agreements, and 
has established two investment groups for Vietnam and Batam 
Island, Indonesia, and converted party-owned and state-owned 
corporations with investment names have gone to South Vietnam, 
Papua New Guinea, and even Subic Bay in the Philippines, 
preparing to invest in developing industrial zones. "Going 
south" has brought about a situation that has surprised people, 
with Taiwan businesses investing more than $2 billion in Vietnam. 
  Nevertheless, this "going south" seems as if it involves 
losing a lot with little to be gained. First, from a long-term 
point of view, "going south" could allow Taiwan to enter a 
future "ASEAN Free Trade Zone," and thereby open up markets. But 
the bloc mentality of the ASEAN countries is strong, and the 
proposed "ASEAN Free Trade Zone" and the "mutual preferential 
tariffs" among member countries would not be extended to 
countries outside the region. For this reason, even if Taiwan 
goes all out, there is still no way for it to become a 
dialoguing partner of ASEAN. Second, the ASEAN countries have 
recently been courting Beijing, and under the circumstances of 
this major trend, Taiwan also will find it difficult to develop 
relations with ASEAN. When it comes to the real working 
administrative levels, the ASEAN countries' level of 
modernization is on the low side, and the political and economic 
aspects of the societies still lack a basic and efficient 
structure, while when it comes to electrical power, they all 
have insufficient quantities, not to mention the issue of the 
kidnapping and blackmailing of Chinese businessmen in the 
Philippines and the exclusion of Chinese in Indonesia and 
Malaysia. It is also precisely because of this that even though 
Taiwan businessmen take the policy lead, and for a time no small 
number of investors have been going to all the countries of 
Southeast Asia, at present this trend has shown a marked decline. 
<H5>  "Vacation Diplomacy" and Changing Policy Directions </H5>
  Hence Taiwan's avid promotion over the past year of a "go 
south policy" in fact can also be seen in the light of the 
discussion over this same period of the movement to "reenter the 
United Nations," and the proposal for a "staged unification of 
the two China's." It also may be said that "going south" seems 
to be a by-product of the staged "two China's" policy, with the 
hope that having penetrated the south it will be possible 
economically to maintain long-term relations with the Chinese 
mainland. 
  Nevertheless, at a time when the reputation of the 
"southward" policy has not yet become tarnished, it is possible 
that because "going south" will not be successful, while on the 
one hand the Chinese mainland has become a focal point for 
investment by countries all over the world, and on the other the 
United Nations General Secretary also clearly does not support 
Taiwan entering the UN, that Taiwan this year may also start to 
change its policy. 
  On 5 January, Executive Yuan head Lien Chan engaged in 
"vacation diplomacy" with Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok 
Tong over breakfast, reaching a common understanding to jointly 
form a company, with Taiwan providing money, and Singapore 
providing personnel, to jointly develop Hainan Island. 
  On the same day (5 January), the Council on Economic 
Planning 
and Development (CEPD) drafted a "go west" strategy, which would 
link Taiwan up with the mainland to form an "economic alliance": 
linking western Taiwan with the three areas of Shanghai, Xiamen, 
and Guangzhou to form a fan-shaped industrial complementary 
zone; at the same time, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Shanghai would be 
linked to form an integrated system with division of labor 
involving development, management, and manufacturing. 
  On 6 January, CEPD Deputy Director Chen Chi (7115 3823) 
stated that he would immediately propose that Hong Kong be taken 
off the list, and that the strategy be changed to have Taipei, 
Shanghai, and Singapore enter into financial, technological, 
shipping, and labor exchanges, coming together to form an Asia- 
Pacific region operated "Golden Triangle." Because Singapore 
replaced Hong Kong, Taipei suddenly seemed to be stretched 
across two regions, west and south. 
  This new concept, is not "go south" or "go west," or that 
"going west is contained in going south," rather it is "going 
west" and "going south" at the same time. Therefore, this is 
where the confusion of the people of Taiwan stems from. 
<H5>  Policy Contradictions Puzzle People </H5>
  First, isn't our policy, after all, both to "go south" and 
to 
"go west?" Originally, "going south" was the opposite of "going 
west," and the goal was to reduce economic links with the 
mainland, but "going west" then strengthens this relationship. 
For this reason, "going west" originally could not coexist with 
"going south." 
  Second, as for Taiwan cooperating with Singapore to develop 
Hainan, people say there is no harm in it, but the problem is 
that Taiwan businessmen early on had already been through a 
"Hainan Island craze," but due to the fact that Hainan both 
lacks a market, and does not have a good basic infrastructure, 
up to now the total investment has not exceeded $30 million. 
Businessmen are not going to invest for objective economic 
reasons. And secondly, in Taiwan's cooperation with Singapore, 
Taiwan is putting up the money, and Singapore is putting up the 
people; this type of arrangement is very dubious, because while 
Singapore's forte is management, when it comes to agriculture 
and mining type industries it has very little experience. In the 
final analysis what is so special about the linking up of Taiwan 
and Singapore? 
  Third, any three sided cooperative development requires good 
conformity of funds, technology, people and the market with the 
political and economic atmosphere, and when it comes to this 
aspect, what sort of skill do Taiwan and Singapore bring to the 
problem? How will they be able to reach a common understanding 
with the mainland? As for the "Golden Triangle" to be drawn 
between Shanghai, Singapore, and Taipei, this is even more 
unrealistic. There are no communications, banking, or personnel 
links between Taipei and Shanghai, so how can this triangle be 
formed? 
<H5>  With Such an Outcome, No Going South, No Going West </H5>
  Hence, with this tangle of "going south" and "going west," a 
reasonable conjecture under the current circumstances where 
"going south" will not work and Taiwan does not dare to "go 
west," should be that there is a singular compromise. Currently 
between the two sides of the straights there is no investment 
guarantee agreement, and so Singapore must be temporarily 
borrowed as a shield. Nevertheless, by the time the CPC has 
independent guarantee stipulations for Taiwan, whether or not 
Taiwan businesses will pass through Singapore, and register each 
company, is doubtful. In this manner, with many hidden costs, it 
will also make Taiwan's complete journey west even more 
difficult to develop. Go west? Go south? I am only afraid that 
in this continuing tangle, Taiwan will lose even more bargaining 
chips. 
  As long as Taiwan runs into problems with the mainland, it 
will promptly feel at a loss as to what to do. Over the past ten 
years, Taiwan businesses, under a situation where the government 
was at a lost as to what to do, had no procedures for investing 
in the mainland, and the government only put forward 
"overheating," "cooling," and industrial hollowization 
[kongdonghua] negative type proposals, and did not have a very 
active strategy. This blind "go west" strategy has on the 
contrary provided CPC officials with a "draw in the people, 
depreciate officials" strategic space. In fact, Taiwan 
businesses have not made mistakes, the mistake is that the 
government has been stuck in the quick sand of "unification or 
independence." 
  For this reason, the tangle of "going south" or "going west" 
is murky, and the only explanation is that Taiwan basically has 
no policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Yi (2621 1837) entitled: "A Strong Political </F>
Boost Behind Economic Cooperation Between the Mainland and 
Taiwan: Dissecting Taiwan Mainland Cooperation on Investment in 
Hainan"] 
  [Text] Taiwan has decided to form a joint corporation with 
Singapore to invest in the development of Hainan Island. This 
plan on the surface appears to be an economic one, but in 
reality the background behind this plan has an important 
political content. And the CPC, because it agreed to this plan, 
also is considering countermoves. Behind the CPC's attraction of 
investment also lies a certain political purpose. 
  The plan for Taiwan businesses to invest in Hainan goes 
under 
the name of economic cooperation, and is also a political boost 
for both sides of the straights. . 
<H5>  Highlighting Taiwan's Position as a "Sovereign Country" </H5>
  In confronting the swarm of Taiwanese businessmen recently 
entering the mainland market, Taiwan authorities have 
consistently been apprehensive that too many Taiwan businesses 
are being drawn into economic trade activity, and that this 
constitutes a non-governmental force among the people that would 
tie down the policies of mainland authorities. For example, with 
the "three connections" issue [China, Taiwan, commerce, postal 
communications, and air and sea transport], Taiwan officials 
recently also have been subjected to every kind of pressure, 
because Taiwan businesses generally demand direct "open air 
traffic," and direct "open business dealings," causing the 
authorities much difficulty in holding fast under the 
established conditions (the CPC must renounce the use of force 
against Taiwan and give Taiwan international space), allowing 
the "guiding principle of unification of the country" to enter 
into an intermediate state, and permitting the state of the 
"three connections." 
  What meaning does making Taiwan business investment in the 
mainland transcend relations between the two sides endow to 
international investment? This is the major task for Taiwan 
officials doing all they can to implement the policies of "the 
two sides as reciprocal political entities" and a "staged two 
China's." For this reason, Singapore was brought into the 
picture, and the formation of a joint corporation for the joint 
development of Hainan's four natural resources of oil, natural 
gas, minerals, and tourism, has become an important measure. 
This plan has Taiwan putting up funds, Singapore providing the 
name and personnel, and in reality is based primarily on putting 
up the name. In this manner, this natural resource sector among 
Taiwan's investments in the mainland, which touches on Taiwan's 
economic lifelines, constitutes an international investment, and 
avoids the situation where the CPC in the future could 
nationalize Taiwan's source of oil, even as it achieves a 
certain political purpose. 
  Taiwan business investment in the mainland has changed to 
become an international investment, and also highlights Taiwan's 
position as a sovereign country. This is beneficial to Taiwan's 
expansion of its international space, to defeat of the CPC's 
attempts to isolate Taiwan internationally, and to promote the 
policy of "two China's by stages." 
  Another important factor is that Taiwan and the mainland 
until now, as a result of the sovereignty issue and failure to 
agree to an accord on guaranteeing investment, have also not yet 
agreed to an accord on mutual exemption from rental taxes. But 
Singapore has separately concluded accords with the mainland and 
Taiwan on investment guarantees and mutual exemption from rental 
taxes. With this type of investment in a major projects (the 
development of oil, natural gas, and mineral natural resources), 
Taiwan businesses also require an accord on guarantees. Using a 
Singaporean corporation's name, of course, is quite a good 
option. 
<H5>  CPC Strengthens Its Economic Leverage Over Taiwan </H5>
  From the CPC's point of view, the new CPC document on Taiwan 
policy of early this year shows that the CPC's three principles 
towards Taiwan have not yet changed. These three principle are: 
the one China principle, the principle of not undertaking to 
abandon the use of force against Taiwan, and in terms of 
international space, the principle of continuing to restrict 
Taiwan's activities. 
  The principle of the use of force against Taiwan is only a 
threat of force, and has no meaning in terms of guiding current 
actions. What is really guiding present actions internationally 
is the continuation of the use of the "one China" policy to 
oppose Taiwan's policy of "two Chinas by stages," and in this 
way restricting Taiwan's international room to maneuver. 
  Because of changes within Taiwan's internal political 
situation, there is more and more tendency to have a regular 
posture vis-a-vis the mainland. Hence, the State Council's 
Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Zhaoguo [3769 0340 0948], in 
an early January public speech, also changed from the past's 
emphasis on unification as the main task, "placing hope on 
Taiwan authorities, and also placing hope on the people of 
Taiwan," to "placing hope on Taiwan authorities, and placing 
even more hope on the people of Taiwan." It should also be said 
that the CPC has strengthened its people-to-people "work" 
vis-a-vis Taiwan, and created a posture of "having the people 
pressure the authorities." 
  Under the premise of confronting the changes in Taiwan's 
political situation and the coordination of the three 
principles, the focal point of the CPC's work on Taiwan has been 
determined: economically, leverage over Taiwan, in military 
affairs, pressure on Taiwan, and internationally, restricting 
Taiwan. 
  Of these, economically gaining leverage over Taiwan means 
attracting Taiwan businesses to invest in the mainland. This, on 
the one hand stems from the requirements of the mainland's 
economic development, and on the other also increases the 
dependence of Taiwan's economy on the mainland. The mainland is 
large, while Taiwan is small, and if the mainland lacks 
investment from Taiwan businesses, then this type of risk can be 
endured; Taiwan, a short time after it forms an economic 
dependence on the mainland, will seem to lack the mainland's 
market, the mainland's resources and raw materials, and it is 
very possible that Taiwan's authorities could be compelled to 
submit politically. 
  This is the political meaning of the CPC economically 
gaining 
leverage over Taiwan, and Taiwan of course cannot but recognize 
this, and also cannot but protect itself. 
<H5>  Both Sides Use Political Abacus </H5>
  The issue of a guarantee accord for Taiwan investment was 
raised during last year's April Gu-Wang talks and, at that time, 
because of the "sovereignty issue," Taiwan was not able to 
consult on a country-to-country guarantee accord and the issue 
was shelved. 
  Since this time, the CPC has been more and more eager to 
"economically gain leverage over Taiwan," and therefore has 
decided to use an internal legislative approach to seek an 
investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses. 
  But Taiwan authorities on the contrary have not been as 
ardent in pursuit of a relevant guarantee accord. For this 
reason, if the mainland is using a legislative approach, an 
investment guarantee for Taiwan businesses on the mainland is 
still limited by the "one country" category of the relationship 
between the two sides. Taiwan must seek a "two country" or "many 
country" guarantee, and for this reason has decided to promote 
the plan calling for Taiwan Singapore cooperation to develop 
Hainan. 
  When it comes to the plan for Taiwan Singapore cooperation 
to 
develop Hainan, CPC officials on the surface are still reticent, 
and have yet to make known where they stand on this issue. It is 
quite clear that the CPC is still considering the political 
content of this plan, while locally, particularly on Hainan, 
where activity is already taking place, officials are hastily 
making preparations for large scale investments from Taiwan 
businesses. 
  In appraising future CPC countermeasures, in terms of 
large-scale, major projects, the Taiwan Singapore cooperative 
development plan will channel this sector cooperation into the 
international investment category. At the same time, a large 
amount of investment will be channeled based on major projects 
and the border investment projects of Taiwan businesses; medium 
and small scale Taiwan business investment projects will be 
allowed within the category of economic cooperation between the 
two sides of the straights. Using the former to spur on the 
latter, the latter then can help to achieve the political goal 
of "gaining economic leverage over Taiwan."

<F P=106> [Article by Cheng Ying (2110 1305) entitled: "Hainan Pays </F>
Close Attention to Development Trends in Taiwan Singapore 
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Taiwan's Executive Yuan head Lien Chan in early 
January engaged in a week of "vacation diplomacy" in Malaysia 
and Singapore, and at one point became a media focal point; the 
repercussions on Taiwan amounted to fervor for investment in 
Hainan. 
<H5>  Intensity of Beijing's Reaction Yet To Be Determined </H5>
  The diplomatic technique the CPC has used with the upper 
levels of Taiwan's government has reflected a low-key approach. 
CPC officials, through diplomatic personnel stationed in 
Malaysia, lodged protests, but these lacked any new content. 
After the event, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin's 
statement on where China stands on the issue also did not go 
beyond past statements, but pointed out that Lien Chan's 
so-called "vacation diplomacy" in essence is a new type of 
flower involving a "diplomacy elastically stretching to 
encompass real affairs," the goal of which is to have "two 
Chinas" and "one China one Taiwan." He expressed China's 
"resolute opposition" to this approach. 
  On 2 January, Lien Chan arrived in Singapore, and the CPC 
adopted an look but not talk approach, perhaps being unwilling 
to cause problems for old friend Lee Kuan Yew. 
  The CPC-controlled media remained silent, and Renmin Ribao 
and provincial level party papers did not report any news 
concerning this event. 
  However, XINHUA's "reference dispatch" was different than 
others, and though it never directly published the official 
position, it provided a wide-ranging commentary on foreign media 
reporting and the bent of Taiwan and Hong Kong press 
commentaries, hence it is possible to ferret out the CPC's 
attitude on this event. The Hong Kong Taiwan edition of the 
"reference dispatch" for the first 10 days of January described 
Taiwan, and the CHINA TIMES, Joint Report, and NEW NEWS reports, 
editorials, and commentaries related to Lien Chan's visit all 
paid particular attention to Taiwan's "go south policy," and "go 
west policy," and the issue of Taiwan Singapore joint investment 
in Hainan became a focal point of commentary. 
<H5>  Singing the Same Old Tune, Affirming Investment </H5>
  Hong Kong's leftist periodicals, though they did no news 
follow up on Lien Chan's trip, after the event (10 days after 
Lien had returned to Taiwan), took a comparatively "official" 
position, using commentaries to attack Taipei's "vacation 
diplomacy," not only several steps later than the Foreign 
Ministry statement, but also singing the same old tune, with not 
a shred of anything new. 
  Hong Kong's newspaper commentaries, when discussing the 
results of Lien's visit to Singapore, were also brimming with 
affirmation and admiration. This was all due to the fact that 
news of Taiwan Singapore cooperation in investing in Hainan "has 
already received the approval of relevant quarters on Taiwan," 
and Taiwan authorities "are actively appraising the feasibility 
of this plan." The commentators believe that Lien's proposal to 
develop Hainan is "implementing a mainland policy by moving to 
take the initiative," and "there is no doubt that many 
investment opportunities will be provided to Taiwan businesses." 
The commentaries describe Taiwan business circle figures as 
having the following view on this trend: "it will help in 
bettering relations between the two sides, and develop the 
aspect of mutual benefit." 
<H5>  "Association for Economic Promotion" Establishment Not By </H5>
Chance 
  At the same time as CPC officials are criticizing Taiwan for 
"vacation diplomacy," and going all out in engaging in a "one 
China, one Taiwan" plot, high level leaders on Hainan are not 
listening to the sounds coming from the center, and have made 
economic circles in Hong Kong and Taiwan focus attention on the 
announcement of the establishment of the "Hainan-Taiwan (Hong 
Kong and Macao) Association for Economic Cooperation" 
(abbreviated the Association for Economic Cooperation). This 
seems to manifest an attitude of "you in the `center' talk about 
political principles, and we will talk about economic benefits." 
  This "Association" is by no means a makeshift creation of 
the 
Hainan provincial party committee. Earlier, in May of 1993, 
Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu, during an interview with the 
Taiwan media, disclosed that tentative concept that the province 
was "strengthening cooperation with Taiwan." In July, concrete 
appraisals and preparations got under way. When the 
"Association" registered its establishment, though Taiwan only 
had two of the fourteen founding enterprises (Hainan had eight, 
and Hong Kong four), the provincial Taiwan affairs office had 
considerable influence among the players. 
  It was decided to call the association "Hainan Taiwan" and 
not "Hainan, Hong Kong, Taiwan," a fact that appears to have 
significant import. The provincial Taiwan affairs office on its 
own facilitated the "Association" by stressing it is a "popular 
organization," and also indicates that Hainan does not wish to 
reveal its political essence. Vice Governor Mao Zhijun stated 
that if an enterprise wants to join the "Association," it must 
first support the unification of the "deeply loved motherland." 
In sum, Hainan Province, at the time it announced the 
establishment of the "Association," was clearly indicating that 
it was unwilling, because of central political principles, to 
abandon the benefits of Taiwan business investment in Hainan, 
and that its approach would be different from the way the CPC is 
handling Sino-British relations, which is pinning down economic 
projects, and from the approach six months ago of using economic 
sanctions against France to protest French arms sales to Taiwan. 
<H5>  Provincial Party Committee Paying Close Attention to Effect </H5>
of Lien Chan 
  Lien Chan, when he met in Singapore with Prime Minister Goh, 
proposed the tentative idea of linking hands to develop Hainan 
and making Hainan into the economic hot spot of southeast Asia 
in a short space of time. The Hainan Provincial Party committee 
is playing close attention to news relevant to this and to the 
reaction on Taiwan, and in addition to strengthening the flow of 
information, provincial officials issued a directive on it to 
the Hong Kong Longtou Corporation (Huahai), requesting that 
Huahai use its "window" role, and thoroughly evaluate "the 
effectiveness of Lien Chan" on the trend of Taiwan investment in 
Hainan. The close attention paid by the Hainan provincial Party 
committee to Lien's visit to Singapore includes the following 
points: 
  1) The specific content of Lien and Goh's tentative plan to 
cooperate on investment in Hainan; 
  2) Singapore's support for Taiwan to become a "dialogue 
partner" of ASEAN, and the reaction to this in the region; 
  3) The concrete plan of the Taiwan side to "develop" 
Zhongnan 
Peninsula; 
  4) The situation in the past when Taiwan businessmen in 
Singapore jointly invested with new countries in the mainland 
market; 
  5) What specific actions and reactions Taiwan businesses 
have 
had, etc. 
<H5>  Overseas Organizations Work To Coordinate Techniques </H5>
  "Huahai" Corporation is the top organization Hainan 
officials 
control in Hong Kong and Macao. Looking at the corporations's 
major achievements in the eight years since Huahai became 
stationed in Hong Kong, its diversified management, and the 
overall leadership of the province's small and large Hong 
Kong-based organizations and enterprises, the corporation's 
special advantages and position can clearly be seen. Businesses 
overseen by Huahai not only include trading, real estate, and 
financial businesses, but also visa brokers. 
  Recently the affairs of the Huahai Corporation seem to have 
become even busier. The tentative plan for Taiwan and Singapore 
to jointly develop Hainan has brought a new turning point to the 
development of the island. The director of the Huahai 
Corporation says that in order to adapt to a foreign oriented 
economy, he welcomes potential investment in Hainan, tourism is 
riding a new high tide, and the Huahai-subordinate Hainan 
Tourism Corporation will be supplying a series of business 
tourist services convenient for Taiwan businesses, from plane 
chartering services to arranging complete full-service tours of 
Hainan, and consulting services to enhance Taiwan, and other 
foreign business investment. Huahai's external publicity 
material in particular stresses that Hainan supplies "on ground 
visas" for travelling traders, and for Taiwan and foreign 
businessmen staying for no more than 15 days this eliminates 
visa hassles. 
  The special environment of Hainan Island makes it convenient 
for the Hainan Special Economic Zone to implement special 
preferential policies for foreign businesses. It is understood 
that central authorities have given Hainan even greater leeway. 
The Yangpu Development Zone, which has been controversial, going 
from being "patriotic" to "selling the country," has entered 
full bore into the process of attracting business, and the zeal 
with which Hainan Province is seeking foreign business 
investment is evidenced by the province's implementation of the 
"first approve the corporation, then on to the project" approach.

<F P=106> [Article by Shi Hua (2457 5478): "Why Invest in Hainan? What </F>
Is the First Choice for Investment? An Interview With Xiao 
Jixin, a Hong Kong Businessman Investing in Hainan"] 
  [Text] On 28 January, the author visited Hong Kong 
businessman Xiao Jixin, who had just returned to Hong Kong from 
Hainan. He spoke about the background of the tentative plan for 
Taiwan and Singapore to cooperate in the development of Hainan, 
the reaction related to news of the cooperative development, and 
the current opportunities, advantages, and potential choices for 
investment in Hainan. 
  Xiao is a native of Hainan, who more than 10 years ago 
emigrated to Hong Kong, and has consistently been engaged with 
Hainan and Guangzhou-related real estate businesses. At present 
he is the Chairman of the Board of the Hong Kong Jinrong 
Industrial Corporation, Ltd, and the Hainan Sanya Huaya 
(Sino-foreign) Real Estate Development Corporation, Ltd. 
<H5>  First Choice in Investment: Onshore Natural Gas </H5>
  According to Xiao Jixin, for the Taiwan Singapore 
cooperation 
in developing Hainan, the first choice investment point will be 
Sanya City. This is because Sanya is on Hainan's southern tip, 
and nearby Nanshan is the onshore site for taping natural gas. 
Because Taiwan and Singapore have put primacy on exploitation of 
Hainan's petroleum resources, they must establish a base in 
Sanya, and construct various types of service-oriented logistics 
facilities. In addition, Sanya is a scenic tourist vacation 
spot, with sunshine all year round, and winter temperatures that 
do not get below 17 degrees C. The sea water around Sanya is not 
polluted, and beaches have fine sand, all conditions that could 
help it become a first-class tourist vacation spot. 
  Before Taiwan's Executive Yuan head Lien Chan visited 
Singapore, on December 20 of 1993, Singapore senior advisor Lee 
Kuan Yew took an airplane from the mainland making a special 
trip to Sanya, touching down at a coastguard airfield near 
Sanya. Lee's visit to Sanya was very possibly the background to 
the subsequent Lien Chan proposal during his Singapore visit for 
cooperative investment in Hainan. 
<H5>  Ruan Chongwu Holds Meeting To Arrange Welcome for Taiwan </H5>
Investment 
  Xiao Jixin also brought along from Hainan local reaction to 
Lien Chan's proposed plan. According to Xiao, after he heard 
that Taiwan and Singapore were inclined towards investing in 
Hainan, the province's Governor Ruan Chongwu immediately 
convened office level cadres and various specialized corporation 
presidents, and held a meeting, to concretely give instructions 
about how to properly prepare for welcoming Taiwan investment. 
  On 13 January, Ruan met with Taiwan reporters for an 
interview, and pointed out that at present there are excellent 
opportunities for investing in Hainan. Ruan's remarks were 
carried on the front page of the 14 January edition of HAINAN 
RIBAO. 
  In addition, it is reported that when introducing some 
companies from China's hinterland to investment in Hainan, Ruan 
afterwards personally recommended Sanya. 
  Why Sanya? In addition to the two factors described above 
(natural gas deposits and a tourist vacation spot), looking at 
the situation of Hainan as a whole, the northern city of Haikou 
naturally is the locale with the most investment from Taiwan and 
Hong Kong businessmen, but because it is already thriving, the 
investment costs are also much higher. Take real estate, for 
example: in Haikou City's most thriving area it costs 6000 yuan 
per square meter; while because development is Sanya has not yet 
gotten underway, real estate prices have been kept to 2500 to 
3000 yuan per square meter. 
  As for the Yangpu Zone, to be developed by Hong Kong's 
Xiongsu organization, because it is still in the planning stage, 
and also has no tourism resources, it will probably be around 
five years before development is likely to take off. 
<H5>  Airport, Expressway Opening Mid-year </H5>
  Why has Sanya not been developed before now? Xiao Jixin 
points out that the major problem is transportation. Because 
Sanya is situated on the southern tip of Hainan, it does not 
have an airport (it only has a coast guard airport not open to 
the public), and in addition there is not highway from Haikou to 
Sanya. Many tour groups going from Haikou sit on a bus that 
reveals fantastic scenery like, but five or six hours are 
required to get to Sanya. Consequently, though there is a 
wonderful tourism environment, it is very difficult to attract 
tourists to struggle over long distances to come to Sanya. 
  Many years ago, Hong Kong businessman Huo Yingdong at one 
point had a plan to invest in Sanya in the vicinity of Yalong 
(Dragon's Tooth) Bay. Yalong Bay is a 22 kilometer length bay 
with blue waves and fine sand, and the original plan could have 
built a vacation area on this spot, but because of the 
transportation problem, for several years no funds flowed in for 
investment. Up until last year, the plan had been on hold. 
  This year in June an express highway from Haikou to Sanya 
will be open for traffic, and at that time it will only take 
over two hours to get to Sanya from Haikou. In addition, on 1 
July of this year, the currently under construction Sanya 
Fenghuang (Phoenix) International Airport will open, and on that 
occasion, various Hong Kong and southeast Asian airlines will be 
able to fly directly into Sanya. This will inevitably lead to 
the thriving development of Sanya's tourist industry. 
<H5>  Semi-Duty-Free Situation Will Foster Shopping Paradise </H5>
  What advantages are there to investing in Hainan? 
  Since the CPC established Hainan as a province in 1988, the 
prerequisite of "open the first line, properly manage the second 
line" has been established. The so-called "opening the first 
line" involves changing the whole of Hainan Island into a low 
tariff "free island," and departing from Hainan and going to 
China's hinterland then requires going through customs 
procedures, and adopting so-called "proper handling" procedures. 
  Central authorities have allowed Hainan a number of special 
policies. The most important of these includes: the importation 
of machinery facilities is completely duty free, and importing 
consumer goods (except tobacco and alcohol) is semi-duty-free. 
  This condition alone is sufficient to make Hainan become a 
tourist and shopping paradise for mainlanders. Whichever 
consumer goods are able to gain semi-duty free status, 
mainlanders will come here and buy various types of things and 
bring them back, and this will offset tourism expenses. For this 
reason, after the issue of transportation has been solved, the 
running of large scale markets here should have bright 
prospects. In addition, the importation of facilities to produce 
consumer goods also should be a good business. 
  When it comes to the aspect of taxing enterprise profits, 
Hainan's special policy is to only collect 15 percent, half the 
rate for enterprises on the mainland. This is one advantage. 
  The other special policies of Hainan Province include: it is 
possible on Hainan to set up foreign invested banks; foreign 
investment generated hard currency profits can be freely taken 
remit abroad; land can be transferred with compensation, and can 
be divided up by one person and contracted for development; 
foreigners entering can get a "local visa" at Haikou or Sanya; 
Hainan has aviation rights, and can permit foreign airline 
corporations to open Hainan routes, and retain reciprocal flight 
rights. 
<H5>  Nightlife Varied </H5>
  There is another advantage that is not explicitly spelled 
out 
in any regulations. This is the varied look and feel of Hainan's 
nightlife. At present Taiwan businesses have invested in a 
number of entertainment businesses in Haikou, including bars, 
restaurants, discos, dance halls, nightclubs, karaoke bars, etc. 
  Allegedly, large bars are very strict about prostitutes, but 
in discos and dance halls, there are often several hundred 
good-looking women to choose from. 
  In the north there is a saying currently in fashion: "I went 
to Beijing and realized my own position was low, I went to 
Guangzhou and realized that my own wealth was small, I went to 
Haikou and realized that my body was not in good shape." After 
hearing this sentence, one can put one's finger on the situation 
in Haikou. 
  During the development of Sanya, the future state of affairs 
will be relatively the same as for Haikou, as control is 
relatively lax. 
  What projects does Sanya have to invest in? 
  Xiao notes that the hotel business is developing, and at 
present, there are more than 30 in business, more than 30 under 
construction, and more than 30 that have requested permission to 
build. Of course, some of these are small, and he does not know 
of any that are genuine five star hotels. 
  Businesses related to tourism, such as vacation villages, 
water amusement parks, and yacht clubs, in addition to bars, 
eateries, and nightclubs, also should do very well. 
  At present, it is commonly reported that mainland tourists 
coming to Sanya are not buying things. Those "loaded" 
mainlanders come to Sanya and spend several hundred yuan, and 
afterwards go to Guangzhou and buy things, spending several 
thousands of yuan. In the wake of the development of the tourist 
industry, the opening of markets is also a major investment area. 
<H5>  Large Portion of Land Is in Corporate Hands </H5>
  In coming to invest in Sanya, it is of course possible to go 
by the official way, through the government foreign trade 
channels to invest. However, the system on the mainland still 
cannot avoid the trouble of bureaucratism, and examination and 
approval of projects often requires a lot of time. For this 
reason, seeking cooperation with Hong Kong companies well 
acquainted with the situation on the mainland is one way to 
approach the issue. 
  Whatever project one decides to invest in, one will run into 
land problems. It is known that at present in Sanya City there 
is a limited amount of land that is available for developing 
businesses, and in addition to the fact that the government 
strictly controls land, a major portion of the land is in the 
hands of corporations. For this reason, seeking talks with 
corporations holding land about transferring land is also a 
possible shortcut. 
  The tourist industry has been established as Sanya's 
mainstay 
industry, the goal of which is to construct an international 
coastal tourist city. The tourist industry will bring along the 
development of other industries, which will greatly stimulate 
real estate development. 
  At present, there is not much foreign investment in Sanya. 
In 
the wake of the construction of the express highway and the 
airport, prospects for foreign investment in Sanya are looking 
up.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Reducing the Budget Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] A few days ago, the Legislative Yuan passed in three 
readings the "Regulations on the Central Government's 
Construction Bonds and State Loans," raising the uppermost 
proportion of the outstanding balance of government bonds and 
state loans in the annual budget and special budget from 95 
percent to 113 percent, and thereby providing a basis for the 
legally correct passage of the general 1995 fiscal year budget 
bill of the central government, which is now being debated. As 
we understand, the executive intends at the same time to present 
a law on public indebtedness, to replace the current regulations 
on government bonds and state loans, to prevent further 
supplemental resolutions by the Legislative Yuan, so that the 
upper ceiling for the proportion of borrowing may not again be 
raised in the coming year, but it will on that occasion further 
raise the ceiling for indebtedness in order to increase the 
latitude for borrowing in the future. 
  However, regardless of whether the government bond and state 
loan regulations will be changed or whether a separate law on 
public indebtedness will be promulgated, these kinds of actions 
can only solve the legality question of state borrowing, but 
cannot erase the financial deficit. Legislative modifications 
may for a time, but not in the long run prevent the inflation of 
the financial deficit. Not only that, but allowing the financial 
deficit to further inflate is bound to incur disaster for state 
and society for a long period of time. Is this situation not 
cause for anxiety? 
  Referring again to statistical data: At the end of fiscal 
year 1989, the outstanding balance of bonds issued by the 
central government was still less than 200 billion yuan, while 
at that time the government's surplus accumulated over the years 
was as high as over 230 billion yuan. In other words, the 
central government has had no net indebtedness at all, but 
rather a fiscal surplus, while in only five, six years not only 
was the surplus accumulated over the years completely wiped out, 
but the outstanding balance of indebtedness in the 1995 fiscal 
year budget was allowed to rise to as high as around 1,200 
billion yuan. These specific figures are indeed frightening and 
startling by revealing the urgency and seriousness of the 
problem of how to balance fiscal income and expenditure. 
  Be that as it may, the executive sector is apparently 
without 
power to control the expansionist trend in the government 
budget. Even though the Executive Yuan says that the scale of 
the 1995 fiscal year budget shows negative growth when compared 
with fiscal year 1994, so that the expansionist trend in 
expenditures seems to have been controlled, the result of this 
control is nothing but a presentation of fictitious figures. 
That is so because at the start of fiscal year 1995, the 
Executive Yuan decided to no more include the transfer of 
capital increases of government enterprises in the general 
budget, thereby omitting 160 billion yuan from the budget of the 
said year. If that amount would be included, there would still 
be over 10 percent growth in budget expansion. This shows that 
the problem of the central government's increasing fiscal 
deficits is not a problem of insufficient tax revenue, but a 
problem of too fast a growth of expenditure. During the last few 
years, the increase in tax revenue has on the average been still 
higher than the economic growth rate, so that proposals for 
further tax increases to balance out the fiscal deficit will not 
at all truly solve the problem. The only realistic way is to 
reduce public expenditure. 
  How can public expenditure be reduced and the financial 
crisis that will follow on the continuously expanding budgetary 
deficit be averted? The answer is very simple, let us just look 
at the many European and U.S. states that are saddled with 
financial deficits, then we will know. The method to reduce 
public expenditure is extremely common, it is only that there 
are no tricky shortcuts to it. It requires paying a painful 
price, and that is all that is needed for success. The problem 
with it is therefore only whether there is strong enough 
determination; it is not a matter whether the method is or is 
not appropriate to the time. 
  Judging by Taiwan's present condition, how much of a 
determination is necessary and how much hardship is there to be 
faced in reducing public expenditure? First, we have to face the 
social pain of government departments adopting zero-based 
budgets, cutting down and merging organizations, and canceling 
certain operations. Second, in the privatization of public 
enterprises we have to face the social pain caused by public 
enterprises no more being allowed to shift investments, having 
to meet open competition in the market, and staff and workers 
having to transfer to other work places. Third, government 
should remove its controls, allowing civilian participation in 
the free development of education and the development of 
communications, and in such activities as investments in the 
information industry, in transportation, and in public 
utilities, thus creating the "pain" of reducing investment 
possibilities for government departments. Beyond that, after 
establishing a system of assessing public investment plans, we 
shall have to face the pain of not being able to voluntarily put 
forward further construction plans. Furthermore, in order to 
establish the system of intermediate-range and long-range 
capital budgeting, organs and units engaged in public investment 
will have to face the pain of having to submit in advance 
detailed plans by year, by periods, and for the whole range of 
public investments, as they could otherwise not be included in 
the budget. Finally, to reduce the wasteful expenditure of 
subsidies from the central government to the local governments, 
it will also be necessary to establish a system of subsidies to 
local governments that is based on law, and thereby having to 
face the pain of reducing administrative intervention by the 
central government in local governments. 
  All these social pains are related to the renovation of the 
governmental system. For a long time, government departments 
have not been able to keep up with the economic progress in the 
private sector and have not been able to pursue the 
modernization of the system. These are in particular the main 
reasons that have created the present situation of inefficiency 
of government administration and inflated public expenditure. To 
resolve the inherent danger of the fiscal deficits, we therefore 
fervently hope that the authorities in charge of policy 
decisions will take due note, will also show firm determination, 
and by starting out with a reform of the system, be also able to 
tackle the problem of effectively reducing the increase in 
public expenditures.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Southbound Policy and Market Expansion Beyond </F>
Southeast Asia"] 
  [Text] The most prominent characteristics 
in Taiwan's society in the past several years is that most of 
the major changes invariably start from the civilian sector 
which often plays the dominant role in developing the whole 
situation. The responsible department of the government either 
remains indifferent or sternly rebukes and adopts all kinds of 
measures to oppose the changes. When the whole situation has 
changed and what is done cannot be undone, the government 
department would reverse its attitude, admit the facts and even 
humbly regard such changes as an important government policy and 
a major achievement of the government. This is true about the 
mainland policy which affects Taiwan's economic future and the 
relations between the two sides of the Straits. Even a more 
typical example is the southbound policy which attracts the 
attention of the whole society. 
  The southbound development of Taiwan's civilian industries 
had already become more obvious even 10 years ago. This trend 
had reached a peak about six to seven years ago. A large number 
of Taiwan's export processing industries had suffered from the 
sudden deterioration of Taiwan's own business environment. At 
the same time, some Southeast Asian nations had readjusted their 
foreign policies to improve their investment climate in order to 
attract more foreign enterprises to establish factories there. 
Their wages were ten times cheaper than that in Taiwan. These 
favorable terms had posed an irresistible appeal to Taiwan's 
export processing industries which were suffering from labor 
shortages and soaring labor costs. As a result, Taiwan's 
medium-sized and small enterprises went after such a good 
opportunity like a flock of ducks, whipping up a high tide to 
make investments in Southeast Asia. However, during that period, 
the responsible government department was worried. It believed 
that the exodus of a large number of export enterprises would 
empty out Taiwan's industries. In addition, if these processing 
enterprises move their equipment, technology and even orders and 
markets to these nations having a lower labor cost, their action 
would pose a serious threat to those enterprises which stayed in 
Taiwan, and further destroy Taiwan's economy. Therefore, the 
emphasis of the "southbound policy" at that time was how to 
prevent enterprises from leaving Taiwan, constrain them to make 
investments abroad and force them to leave the roots of their 
industries in Taiwan. However, reality is grim. No matter how 
much effort you exert to urge these enterprises to stay, most of 
the export processing industries which had constituted Taiwan's 
main force in exports left the island in a short period of a few 
years. Naturally more and more export processing enterprises 
have now moved from the south to the west and regard mainland 
China's southeast coastal areas as a more favorable location for 
their future development. 
  At a time when a large number of Taiwan's businessmen had 
gradually lost their interest in Thailand, Malaysia and other 
countries, several government departments suddenly reversed 
their attitude, and began to shout aloud that they would 
adequately support and aid those who invested their money in 
Southeast Asia. Furthermore, hoisting high the banner of 
"southbound policy", the president visited Indonesia, Thailand 
and Philippines to carry out his vacation diplomacy during the 
Spring Festival this year. For a short time, the cry to go south 
was louder than ever before, and became the focal point of the 
nation's policy. 
  Nevertheless, when this southbound banner was hoisted high, 
the total investments of Taiwan's businessmen had decreased. 
Moreover, problems had cropped up in those countries to which 
the government encouraged Taiwan's businesses to invest. 
Anti-Chinese riots suddenly broke out recently in Indonesia with 
a population of 200 million which has always regarded itself as 
the leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Even 
now, riots have not been completely controlled. Such riots pose 
a direct threat to the Taiwan investors' lives and properties. 
As a result, their investment enthusiasm, which is not so warm 
to begin with, would certainly cool off. Recently Taiwan's 
businessmen had diverted their attention to Vietnam where the 
wage scale remains extremely low and efficiency is the highest 
in the Communist community in changing its economic structure. 
However, since the United States lifted its embargo to Vietnam 
in February this year, Vietnam has become a new focal point of 
the major U.S., Japanese and European enterprises. The kind of 
predominance enjoyed by Taiwan's businesses in Vietnam no longer 
exists. The price of land in Vietnam is increasing, and there 
are gradually less preferential treatments given to foreign 
investors. The terms of making investments there are far less 
favorable than before. This is another typical example of a 
situation whereas this good prospect is like the evening glow of 
the setting sun even if there is full support from the 
government. 
  Perhaps, there is no need for us to worry about the changes 
in Taiwan's southbound policy. On the contrary, they may provide 
us with an opportunity to expand our market beyond Southeast 
Asia. In despite of the adverse situation in countries which are 
the targets of our southbound policy such as Thailand, Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Vietnam, South Asia will undoubtedly remain the 
area where it is full of vitality in today's world. It will 
definitely be an action of passivity and self-immolation, if we 
cannot join the other nations in taking the full advantage of 
the sign of vitality in South Asia. Southbound market expansion 
is a task that we must work hard to fulfill. However, we must 
not restrict our activities to a designated area or sphere, and 
limit ourselves to the aforementioned several nations. The 
brightest star in South Asia today is India which has a 
population as large as 800 million. It already has a fine 
market, a sound legal and democratic system, an abundant supply 
of cheap, English-speaking labor and a favorable geographical 
position between Europe and Asia. India has adopted the policy 
of improving the investment climate and opening to the outside 
world since last year. This policy has indeed created a fine 
condition for India to develop itself. It is also one of our 
southbound targets which must not neglect. 
  We must not restrict ourselves to the several target 
nations, when we study our southbound policy. In fact, we should 
not limit ourselves to expanding our market southward. Because 
our southbound policy, on the surface, can be used for the 
economic benefits of our enterprises and as diplomatic 
bargaining chips of our government. However, its true meaning is 
to not only help more developing nations develop their export 
processing industries with which they may increase their 
purchasing power and promote the world's economic prosperity, 
but also make use of the chain effect of the upper-stream and 
downstream industries to expand the sales of Taiwan's products 
and services and promote its economic development. As far as 
this purpose is concerned, the gradual changes for the worse in 
Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam indicate that the aforementioned 
task has been basically fulfilled. We should now divert our 
financial resources and manpower to other backward nations which 
badly need development. We must not restrict ourselves to South 
Asia only. Our banner should spread out in the south, the west, 
the north and the east and in any area with a great potential 
for future development, which awaits our assistance. This is the 
major stride that we should make.

<F P=106> [Report by Chang Hai-lin (1728 3189 3829): "Government To </F>
Find Out Crux of Strange Economic Situation -- Mixed First 
Quarter Economic Indicators Reflect Unclear Economic Situation"] 
  [Text] During the first quarter of 1994, the various 
economic indices were mixed. The growth of exports slowed down, 
but industrial production was up. The gap between revenues and 
expenditures is inconsistent with the situation in trading, and 
the economic situation is unclear. Hsueh Chi, deputy director of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, Executive 
Yuan, described the current economic situation as "strange and 
changeable" on 22 April. He decided to invite the Central Bank 
of China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of 
Finance to join their efforts in finding the crux. 
  Hsueh Chi pointed out first that our exports in the first 
quarter this year only rose 0.4 percent over 1993, and we rank 
at the bottom of the four small dragons in Asia. "The global 
economy is gradually reviving, but our country shows little 
momentum. It is unusual," he added. 
  Hsueh Chi said that the current economic situation in our 
country is extremely strange and changeable. No one is able to 
make head or tail of it. For example, the growth rate of exports 
for the first quarter of this year not only failed to exceed 
that of the same period last year, it actually dropped a great 
deal, and fell far below the 4.63 percent estimated by the 
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. 
  Second, the annual growth rate of export orders during the 
fourth quarter of 1993 amounted to 4.9 percent. Although it was 
not very high, it often indicates the exports for the first 
quarter of this year. It should not be as low as 0.4 percent. 
Hsueh Chi said that the reason as to why there are more 
merchandise ordered than that actually exported is perhaps 
because of the situation whereas orders are placed to Taiwan, 
while merchandise is shipped out from a third country. 
Nevertheless, we will have to verify what actually happened. 
  Third, the exports growth rate during the first quarter of 
1994 is the lowest one since the third quarter of 1990, but the 
industrial production index is the highest since 1992. If there 
are less demands abroad, how can we still maintain a high growth 
rate in industrial production? Both the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and Development 
simply do not understand. 
  The fourth question raised by Hsueh Chi is that the export 
orders for textile products received in March this year rose 
nearly 20 percent as compared with those in February. Since the 
textile industry in which a great many factories had already 
moved out of the country can still receive more orders, why are 
other industries in our country less competitive? 
  Li Kao-chao, Director of the Economic Research Department of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, also pointed 
out a strange phenomenon. That is, there was no loss of momentum 
in exports in last March, but exports in March this year showed 
a decline of 5.2 percent as compared with the same period in 
last year. 
  In addition, there is a big gap between the favorable 
balance 
of foreign exchange earnings and outlays and the favorable 
balance of customs imports and exports. The Central Bank of 
China fails to understand this. Right now, it is checking to see 
if it is because of the interference from other cash outflowing 
channels, which creates the gap between total volume of export 
orders and the growth rate of exports. 
  In face of the unclear situation in trading at present, the 
Council for Economic Planning and Development will hold a 
consultation committee meeting next week and invite scholars to 
discuss the "current situation in trading and outlook." Hsueh 
Chi hoped that all economic research departments of the Central 
Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and 
Statistics would vie with one another to find out the cause of 
disease in the current economic situation. Right now, the 
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs are studying and analyzing the 
situation. 
  Hsueh Chi pointed out: It may not be difficult to find the 
problem in our current economic situation. It is possible that 
minor issues which had been ignored in the past have become 
today's big problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Jin Junhui (6855 0689 2547): "Initial Analysis </F>
of the Clinton Administration's Foreign Policy Ideas"] 
  [Text] The Clinton Administration's foreign policy is 
characterized by five basic ideas: 1) ensuring the U.S. economic 
security; 2) starting to shift priorities to the Asia-Pacific 
region; 3) popularizing worldwide the Western values, such as 
democracy and human rights, as one of the three pillars of the 
foreign policy; 4) stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction as a foremost task of the foreign policy; and 5) 
promoting so-called multilateralism. 
  In practice, the Clinton Administration's foreign 
policy has undergone several adjustments. At the start, it was a 
Tarnoff doctrine. Later, it was an enlargement strategy, and 
then six strategic priorities. 
  The United States is still exploring how to define its 
position in the post-Cold War world. In such exploration, an 
inevitable question is how to adapt America's foreign policy 
ideas to the reality of the contemporary multipolar and diverse 
world. 
  In early 1993 when Clinton assumed the presidency, he was 
confronted with a grim situation both at home and abroad. The 
post-Cold War world was filled with complex, volatile, and 
uncertain factors. The Western economy remained in the doldrums 
on the whole. In the United States, there were innumerable 
economic and social problems. Quite common among the public was 
the introversive feeling that "we have only to sweep the snow at 
our doors and not bother about the frost on others' roofs." As 
regards the role to be played by the United States in the 
post-Cold War era, divergent views existed among various 
circles, and no consensus could be reached. 
  Over the past year, Clinton has firmly taken the 
reinvigoration of the American economy as the central task. His 
foreign policy has shown the heritage of the past as well as 
something new created by himself. The heritage finds expression 
mainly in his upholding America's leading role in the world, 
stressing the need to maintain a strong national defense despite 
the reduction of the armed forces and military spending, giving 
generous assistance to Russia, and promoting the peace process 
in the Middle East. 
  The new part of Clinton's foreign policy reflects both the 
salient features of the post-Cold War era and the characteristic 
tradition of the Democratic Party. The past year has seen a 
painstaking course traversed by the Clinton Administration's 
foreign policy, with achievements as well as faults and 
setbacks. Accordingly, the policy has been continuously adjusted 
in the course of practice. 
<H5>  I. Five Basic Ideas Characterizing the Clinton </H5>
Administration's Foreign Policy 
  1. Ensuring U.S. economic security as a primary pillar 
of U.S. foreign policy. Clinton and his foreign-policy team 
have all along taken the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy and 
the promotion of world economic development as the central goal 
of the foreign policy. For instance, Clinton's efforts at the 
July 1993 summit meeting of the G-7 nations in Tokyo brought 
about an industrial products market access agreement among the 
U.S. and European countries and Japan. Later, he made all-out 
efforts to win Congress approval for the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. In November, he officiated the APEC ministerial 
conference and held informal meetings with leaders of the APEC 
members in Seattle. And, finally, he managed to conclude 
successfully the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of GATT talks 
before the 15 December 1993 deadline. As U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher said, Clinton's above-mentioned activities 
plus his plan to cut the U.S. deficit by $500 billion within 
five years constitute the "integral elements of the most 
ambitious international economic agenda that any President has 
undertaken in almost half a century."[.sup]1[/] 
  In foreign trade, the Clinton Administration stresses a 
"fair 
trade" principle in opening overseas markets to boost U.S. 
exports and increase employment at home. It has taken a firm 
stand in trade talks and, on many occasions, even resorted to 
unilateral sanctions, which have led to serious confrontation 
with its allies, including European countries and Japan. In 
addition, the Clinton Administration has adopted an 
export-oriented national strategy of "less aid to foreign 
countries and more trade development," "linking aid to foreign 
countries with trade promotion," and "relaxing restrictions on 
exports of certain high-tech products." As a result, more world 
markets were opened to American products in 1993 than at any 
time in the last two generations.[.sup]2[/] 
  2. An apparent shift of foreign policy priorities to 
the Asia-Pacific region. In recent years, the trade volume 
between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has 
accounted for 40 percent of America's total foreign trade and 
exceeded its trade with Western Europe by 50 percent. East Asia 
contains the most dynamic economies in the world. Historically, 
the United States fought in three wars in Asia during the last 
50 years, while more and more Asian immigrants have served to 
"enrich America's cultural and economic mosaic."[.sup]3[/] 
For this reason, Christopher said: "No area of the world will be 
more important for American interests than the Asia-Pacific 
region." "It is thus crucial to the President's domestic 
agenda."[.sup]4[/] Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State 
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also made the remark that 
"the Clinton Administration has elevated Asia's importance and, 
in short, Asia is now more important than ever."[.sup]5[/] 
This is why Clinton's first overseas trip was to Asia and he 
proposed the establishment of a "New Pacific Community." 
Christopher made three visits to Asia within one year, and on 
his visit to ASEAN countries, he clearly expressed the intention 
to get positively involved in the multilateral Asian security 
dialogue following the ASEAN ministerial meeting. Taking the 
opportunity of the APEC conference in Seattle, the United States 
sponsored informal meetings with the leaders of the countries 
concerned. The meetings deepened the U.S. cooperative relations 
with the Asian-Pacific countries and promoted the APEC's 
development. In addition, the Clinton Administration has 
maintained the U.S. troops in the Asia-Pacific region at the 
same 100,000-strong level as in Europe. It is with such a 
background that the Clinton Administration has "recognized 
China's obvious importance in bilateral, regional, and global 
partnership."[.sup]6[/] In September 1993, Clinton himself 
made a decision to proceed with "all-round contacts," raise the 
level of dialogues, and develop extensive exchanges with China. 
In November, a U.S.-China summit took place in Seattle, the 
first such official meeting since 1989. This meeting helped 
improve the relations between the two countries. 
  3. Promotion of Western democracy and human rights 
worldwide raised to the height of one of the three pillars of 
U.S. foreign policy. There are several reasons for this: 
First, stressing the promotion of democracy and human rights is 
a historical tradition of the Democratic Party. Second, the 
United States regards its victory in the Cold War as a triumph 
of its ideology and values. As Clinton once said, "our greatest 
strength is the power of our ideas."[.sup]7[/] Third, after 
the Cold War, the United States has no arch enemy and needs to 
uphold an ideological banner as a major instrument to maintain 
its rallying force at home and abroad. For these reasons, the 
Clinton Administration has put forth an "enlargement strategy" 
to enlarge worldwide "the community of market democracies" as a 
U.S. global strategy to replace the "containment strategy" of 
the Cold War era. To carry out its democracy and human rights 
policy, the Clinton Administration has applied pressure through 
bilateral and multilateral channels, by means of ideological 
infiltration through cultural exchanges, and by using assistance 
and most-favored-nation treatment to foreign countries and the 
State Department's annual human rights reports. It has even set 
up so-called "free" radio stations of one kind or another to 
conduct subversive agitation and propaganda in an effort to 
unscrupulously intervene in others' internal affairs. 
  4. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
their vehicle missiles viewed as a practical and primary threat 
to U.S. national security; prevention of arms proliferation put 
to the fore in the U.S. foreign policy and regarded as "one of 
the most urgent priorities of the U.S. national 
commitments."[.sup]8[/] This involves two principal 
tasks: One is to make every effort to remove the threats from 
the massive nuclear weapons kept by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, 
and Kazakhstan. The other is to prevent nuclear, biological, and 
chemical weapons and missiles from proliferating to those Third 
World countries that the United States believes are the most 
dangerous. To this end, the United States has used both the 
carrot and the stick. It has either used the tactics of 
improving bilateral relations and providing aid or resorted to 
sanctions as a threat and punishment. The Clinton Administration 
is trying to consolidate the system of nonproliferation of 
nuclear weapons, conclude a treaty of comprehensive ban to all 
nuclear testing, and establish a sound "missile technology 
control mechanism" by 1996. In the eyes of the Clinton 
Administration, "the most urgent arms-control issue in the 
1990's is to fight the long-term threat caused by arms 
proliferation."[.sup]9[/] 
  5. The United Nations and other international 
organizations are utilized to promote so-called 
multilateralism. The purpose of multilateralism advanced by 
the United States is to achieve its foreign policy goals while 
dividing the burden among nations to remedy its own financial 
and material deficiencies. Also, if action must be taken, the 
United States will be "in a legal position" to do so, and it 
will be easy to win support from the American public. In June 
1993, Madelenine Albright, chief of the U.S. Mission to the 
United Nations, further stressed that multilateral engagement 
must be led by the United States and become an "assertive 
multilateralism"; otherwise, it cannot serve America's goals 
well and may even damage major U.S. interests.[.sup]10[/] In 
this regard, the Clinton Administration particularly underscores 
the important role of the United Nations and, in actual fact, 
regards it as "a major means of the U.S. foreign 
policy."[.sup]11[/] Because of this, Christopher visited the 
UN Headquarters in New York and called on Secretary General 
Boutros Ghali shortly after he took office. It was also for this 
reason that the U.S. Mission to the United Nations has been 
extremely active. In particular, the Clinton Administration 
attaches importance to the UN peace-keeping function in dealing 
with regional conflicts. If necessary, Christopher said, the 
United States will act alone, but if at all possible, it will 
deal with problems in a multilateral way and prefer to act 
together with others.[.sup]12[/] This is precisely the policy 
the United States pursues in dealing with the issues of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. Under the U.S. powerful 
impetus, the UN peace-keeping operation has expanded from five 
missions, less than 10,000 troops and military observers, and a 
$233 million expenditure in 1987 to 13 missions, 75,000 troops, 
and an expenditure as high as $3 billion in 1993, resulting in a 
hard-to-bear burden on the United Nations. 
<H5>  Three Adjustments in the Clinton Administration's Diplomatic </H5>
Practice 
  (1) Appearance of the "Tarnoff Doctrine" 
  The first major test faced by the Clinton Administration 
with 
respect to foreign policy was how to deal with the armed clashes 
among the three factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the 
beginning, Clinton took a firm stand and directed the spearhead 
of pressure at the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbia 
Republic. In addition to stepping up economic sanctions, 
establishing an international court to prosecute "ethnic 
cleansing" criminals, setting up no-fly zones, and air dropping 
relief supplies, he made two proposals: lifting the arms embargo 
on the Muslim force and launching air strikes on Serb positions. 
But, due to the opposition within the U.S. Government, 
especially from the military, plus the strong objection by its 
NATO allies such as Britain and France, the Clinton 
Administration later took a retreat policy and shelved these two 
proposals. The U.S. hesitation and vacillation on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue induced doubt and perplexity at home 
and abroad. On May 1993, U.S. Under Secretary of State for 
Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff made a candid statement to the 
press. He stated unequivocally that the Clinton Administration's 
stand and action on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue were by no 
means an expedient move, but manifested a new basic policy: 
Limited by its financial and material resources, the United 
States must now concentrate its efforts primarily on developing 
the economy. It can no longer assume a leading role everywhere 
as in the Cold War era. Instead, the U.S. involvement in 
regional conflicts must be commensurate with the threat to its 
interests. With regard to the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, which is 
primarily a European question, the United States has no 
intention of acting unilaterally; it is necessary to take 
concerted action with the European allies playing a main role. 
This is the "Tarnoff Doctrine" foreign policy later so-called by 
the U.S. press. Originally, the "Tarnoff Doctrine" represented a 
selective-engagement and proper-retreat policy that the Clinton 
Administration tried to implement to cope with the new post-Cold 
War situation. Yet, because of its improper presentation and the 
inopportune time (when Clinton had some failings in domestic 
affairs), this kind of statement just helped intensify the image 
of weakness of Clinton's leadership, added to the growth of 
isolationism at home, and produced a harmful effect on America's 
"leading position" in the world. Under such circumstances, it 
was immediately denied by the authorities. 
  (2) Presentation of the "enlargement strategy" 
  Since then, the Clinton Administration has not only stressed 
in words that "the United States must play a leading role in the 
world; this is the core of Clintonism,"[.sup]13[/] but taken 
deliberate actions to show America's strong image and active 
engagement in international affairs. Chief among them are: At 
the Tokyo summit of the G-7 nations, the United States displayed 
a leading role in reducing deficits, promoting the Uruguay Round 
negotiations, and developing the world economy. It promoted and 
organized the Western action to aid Russia. It launched a sudden 
raid on the Intelligence Building in Iraq's capital to show its 
determination and ability to act unilaterally. It decided to 
send 300 troops to Macedonia to prevent the spread of the 
conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and promised to send as large a 
peace-keeping force as 25,000 men to the area after the factions 
involved have reached a peace agreement that they are willing to 
abide by. In Somalia, it expanded the role of the UN 
peace-keeping force and the U.S. troops, saying that their 
mission is not only to provide humanitarian relief but also to 
build a local police force and restore the country's order. With 
regard to banning arms proliferation, it took a strong stance 
and imposed blockades and sanctions against other countries. In 
the Middle East, its active mediation eased the problems 
aggravated by the incident of Lebanese violence and sustained 
the peace talks. And Christopher personally led a U.S. 
delegation to the UN human rights conference and launched an 
offensive against some Third World countries on the issue of 
human rights. 
  These U.S. actions have scored some achievements. The most 
remarkable one was the signing on 13 September 1993 in 
Washington of a Declaration of Peace Principles between 
Palestine and Israel for self-government of the Gaza Strip and 
the Jericho area. On the other hand, setbacks were encountered 
and prices paid. The most prominent was that bloody clashes 
continued in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, for this, the United 
States and its European allies criticized each other scathingly. 
In Somalia, armed clashes intensified between the UN 
peace-keeping force and the United Somali Congress, leading to 
casualties of the peace-keeping troops, American servicemen 
included. This immediately triggered a strong voice at home, 
demanding the withdrawal of American troops from that country. 
  With this background, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
Assistant to the President for National Security Anthony Lake, 
Chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Madelene 
Albright, and President Clinton, one after another, made four 
attention-drawing speeches in late September 1993. Two notable 
ideas were set forth. One was the "enlargement strategy" 
expounded by Lake. It consists of four points: 1) consolidating 
cooperation and unity among those democracies that have 
instituted the market system as a core force in carrying out 
this strategy; 2) actively supporting nascent forces that are 
building market-based democracies--i.e., Russia, central and 
East European countries, and other CIS states; 3) isolating 
diplomatically, economically, militarily, and technologically 
those states hostile to the market and democratic systems and 
prompting those non-democratic countries that have adopted the 
market mechanism to advance toward democracy; and 4) providing 
humanitarian aid to developing countries suffering bitterly from 
natural disasters or man-made calamities and prompting them to 
develop markets and democracy.[.sup]14[/] 
  The other idea was prominently reflected in the following 
passage in Clinton's address to the United Nations General 
Assembly: "The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in 
every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are 
to say `yes' to UN peacekeeping, the United Nations must know 
when to say `no.'"[.sup]15[/] From now on, he said, the 
United States will ask some rigorous questions before deciding 
on whether to take part in a peace-keeping operation. Examples 
of the questions are how much threat is posed to peace, whether 
the peace-keeping mission has a clear objective, whether an end 
point can be identified for the mission, and how much the 
mission will cost. In people's eyes, this is a retreat from the 
original U.S. miltilateralist stand of vigorously advocating the 
reliance on UN peace-keeping operations to deal with issues of 
regional conflicts. 
  The above-mentioned "enlargement strategy" and the selective 
peace-keeping operations reflect the confusion and 
self-contradiction of the U.S. foreign policy ideas. On the one 
hand, it has a great ambitious goal. On the other hand, it feels 
that it has limited methods and is incapable in practice. As a 
commentary published in a U.S. newspaper puts it well, "the 
Clinton Administration's difficulty lies in how to preserve 
America's traditional leadership while minimizing its 
international commitments so as to concentrate its efforts on 
domestic affairs."[.sup]16[/] 
  Shortly after Clinton's above address, the U.S. and UN 
peace-keeping operation suffered a serious setback in Somalia. 
In a combat on 3 October, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed, and 
another several dozens were wounded. The U.S. military personnel 
sent to Haiti to restore the democratic order were rebuffed and 
forced to come back before landing. At that time, U.S. public 
opinion vied to criticize the government. Representative Frank 
McCloskey of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote an 
article openly asking Christopher to resign. Meanwhile, the 
acute difference between the United States and its European 
allies in the Uruguay Round negotiations threw their relations 
to an all-time low. And the U.S. relations with some Third World 
countries also kept deteriorating. 
  (3) "Six strategic priorities" put forth by 
Christopher 
  Under these circumstances, the U.S. Government once again 
reviewed and reexamined its foreign policy. On 4 November when 
testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Christopher delivered another important speech, setting forth 
"six strategic priorities" for the U.S. foreign policy and the 
"realistic principles" for dealing with regional conflicts. The 
contents and order of the six strategic priorities are as 
follows: 1) ensuring U.S. economic security; 2) supporting the 
political and economic reforms in Russia and other CIS members; 
3) revitalizing NATO to meet the challenges faced by Europe 
under the new circumstances; 4) enhancing ties and cooperation 
with the Asia-Pacific region--this includes the "U.S. efforts to 
work out a comprehensive relationship with China that permits 
resolution of differences in a broad, strategic context"; 5) 
advancing on the basis of the breakthroughs made in the 
Arab-Israel peace process and trying to bring about an overall 
and lasting peace in the Middle East; and 6) promoting the 
nuclear nonproliferation principle worldwide and solving other 
global questions. 
  In dealing with regional conflicts such as those in Haiti, 
Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.S. general guideline is: 
The U.S. role and the extent of its involvement will need to be 
informed by a strict assessment of its own interests and the 
interests of others. It must examine every case--asking rigorous 
questions and giving measured answers--to find the course 
commensurate with U.S. interests. "The United States will not 
attempt to force a settlement on Bosnia militarily. No imposed 
settlement would endure," Christopher pointed out 
unequivocally.[.sup]17[/] It seems that his testimony 
reflects a relatively pragmatic attitude now taken by the 
Clinton Administration. In action, this attitude is essentially 
reflected in two ways: One, the Clinton Administration is more 
able to face up its mistakes and has made a more appropriate 
policy adjustment. Two, it pays attention to using dialogues and 
consultations to reduce naked suppressive action. 
<H5>  The Clinton Administration Still Exploring How To Define </H5>
U.S. Position in the World 
  In a February 1993 article entitled "Clinton and the World," 
Dr. Henry Kissinger said that Clinton's task is to find a role 
for the United States to play in a world that it can neither 
dominate nor simply withdraw from.[.sup]18[/] Generally 
speaking, the Clinton Administration's diplomatic practice over 
the past year seemed to "zigzag" on the road to explore how to 
do this. The "Tarnoff Doctrine" at the inception was a 
not-so-successful attempt to "retreat" and "shrink." The 
subsequent "enlargement strategy" was aimed at reestablishing 
the U.S. dominance in the world as a general guiding principle 
for the American foreign policy. Yet the ruthless reality gave a 
lesson to this principle. As Charles Maynes, chief editor of the 
U.S. quarterly FOREIGN POLICY, commented in an article, "the 
United States must recognize the ruthless reality that even a 
superpower will become exhausted in trying to act as a world 
police." Under the current U.S. situation marked by a strained 
financial budget and a shrinking military force, the adoption of 
the "enlargement strategy" "seems to be marching toward 
shouldering unlimited new responsibilities rather than limiting 
the U.S. commitments."[.sup]19[/] So the "six strategic 
priorities" and the realistic principle for dealing with 
regional conflicts were put forward in an attempt to resume 
America's relatively pragmatic status in the world. Of course, 
regardless of the adjustments, the above-mentioned five major 
foreign policy ideas remain in the Clinton Administration's 
foreign policy. At this time, it appears that the United States 
is still in the process of exploring how to define its position 
in the post-Cold War world. 
  Nonetheless, it should be noted that an inevitable question 
in this exploration is how to adapt the U.S. foreign policy 
ideas to the multipolarization trend and diversification reality 
in the contemporary world. An obstacle to such adaption is the 
traditional U.S. concept that its foreign policy should serve 
the American values. As I see it, while United States is fully 
entitled to believe in and publicize its values, it has no right 
at all to impose its values on others. Nor does it have any 
right to press other countries and interfere in their internal 
affairs in various ways in an attempt to create a global order 
and peace under the rule of the United States. This is the key 
reason for the sharpening contradictions between the United 
States and many Third World countries. It is also a main cause 
leading to unrest in the world. There is no exaggeration if we 
attribute such contradictions and unrest to the hegemonism and 
power politics contained in the U.S. foreign policy.
