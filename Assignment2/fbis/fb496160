<F P=106> [Press release from the French Prime Minister's Office on 22 </F>
February on "the conditions of the restart of the Superphenix, 
which will become a prototype reactor dedicated to research and 
demonstration purposes"] 
  [Text] Creys-Malville, 22 Feb (LOGOS) -- The government 
decided that Superphenix will no longer be operated as a nuclear 
power station, but will become a reactor dedicated to research 
and demonstration purposes. Renewed operation of the reactor 
will constitute part of the effort to get control of the nuclear 
network. The two main objectives are to carry out research into 
the use of plutonium and to reduce the amount of long-term 
radioactive waste produced by reprocessing fuel from nuclear 
reactors, within the framework of the law on radioactive waste 
management, dating from 30 December 1991. Moreover, Superphenix 
will make a key contribution towards defining the reactors of 
the future, destined to burn a higher proportion of natural 
uranium, which today is only used in a proportion of 1 percent. 
The reactor will develop as rapidly as possible towards 
under-production, so as to limit the amount of plutonium 
produced. With regard to safety, the government has taken note 
of the conclusions reached by the safety authority, which 
concluded that the renewed start-up of Superphenix could be 
authorized on the following conditions: The work aimed at 
combatting sodium fires must be concluded in a satisfactory way; 
the start-up must be gradual, progressing in stages; the 
production of electricity cannot be a primary goal; and, in view 
of its prototype status, the operation of the reactor can be 
suspended [at any time]. 
<H5>  Research Program Subject To High-Level Scientific Control </H5>
  A steering committee comprising NERSA [European Rapid 
Neutron 
Nuclear Center], EDF [French Electricity Company], and the CEA 
[Atomic Energy Commission] will have to present a knowledge 
acquisition program taking account of the new guidelines imposed 
on Superphenix. At the suggestion of the minister of research, 
this program will be assessed by two scientists, Mr. Dautray and 
Mr. Detraz. The implementation of the program will be followed 
by a special scientific committee. Each year, this scientific 
committee will submit a report on the experiments conducted in 
reducing long-term waste to the National Assessment Committee, 
which was set up under the terms of the law dated 30 December 
1991. The experiments will have to be authorized in advance by 
the Nuclear Installations Safety Directorate. Every six months, 
the steering committee will report to the ministers responsible 
for research, industry, and the environment on the planned 
progress and on potential difficulties foreseen in the 
implementation of the knowledge acquisition program. EDF will 
not be authorized to issue any orders concerning the level of 
power at which Superphenix will operate, thereby allowing 
maximum leeway for the knowledge acquisition program. Taking 
account of the new guidelines for Superphenix, which will be 
listed in the authorizing decree, the government will decide 
whether to go ahead with the administrative procedure. The 
actual renewed start-up will only be authorized when the 
knowledge acquisition program has been approved. A statement on 
this decision will be made by the ministers of industry, the 
environment, and research on Wednesday, 23 February, at 1130 
[1030 GMT].

<F P=106> [Article signed BN: "Superphenix Restarted. Six Months of </F>
Operation As Fast Breeder Reactor"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Paris, 23 Feb (ATS) -- The French Government decided 
to restart the Superphenix with a "research and demonstration" 
mission. Designed to produce more fissionable material than it 
consumes, the installation has been shut down since 3 July 1990. 
It will only have operated at full power as a fast breeder 
reactor for six months. 
  According to its promoters, Superphenix, a project launched 
more than 20 years ago and presented in 1970 as the "big hope" 
of French industry, was to "play the same role in the 21st 
century as the steam engine in the 19th century." Ten years 
later, President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said, after the first 
oil crisis, that the fast breeder reactor "would give France 
energy reserves comparable to those of Saudi Arabia." 
  Superphenix was damaged around 12 times, suffered two 
prolonged shutdowns, and, from the start of work 17 years ago, 
prompted opposition and discussions between opponents and 
supporters of this nuclear network. 
  Linked to the EDF [French Electricity Company] network on 14 
January 1986, Superphenix experienced problems from May 1987. A 
sodium leak between the walls of the cylinder which allows the 
loading and unloading of the fuel, led to an initial shutdown of 
two years. The cylinder was replaced at the end of 1991 by a 
fuel transfer pump of a new design. 
  Meanwhile the EDF set up a temporary unloading structure in 
January, 1989, which was to last two years. Superphenix was 
ready to resume operation but in October it was shut down for 
maintenance work. 
  On 3 July 1990, there was a second serious incident and 
another shutdown. The sodium which ensures the transfer of heat 
from the heart of the reactor to the steam generators, became 
oxidized. The EDF attributed the incident to a maintenance 
defect. The Superphenix has been shut down ever since.

<F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "Cold Fusion Siena-Style </F>
Gives Fresh Hope"] 
  [Text] Siena -- We have become used to press conferences 
where the extraordinary results of cold fusion experiments are 
announced. In the golden epoch of Fleischmann and Pons, that is 
exactly four years ago, we went to half a dozen of them. 
However, after the commotion about the results, the enthusiasm 
invariably died down. Other researchers did not manage to 
reproduce the experiment, or it gave contradictory results. The 
acclaimed excess of energy from a modest test-tube remained a 
laboratory riddle. 
  Professors Sergio Focardi, Roberto Habel, and Francesco 
Piantelli, and University of Siena Rector Luigi Berlinguer, know 
this story very well. Therefore, at the opening of the press 
conference they called in the public hall of the university at 
12 o'clock yesterday, they gave correct and well-balanced 
information to the journalists. 
  "We are carrying out research that we judge to be of great 
scientific importance," they said. "However, we are reluctant 
to talk about cold fusion and of eventual applications, because 
we do not want to arouse a commotion. If we have been forced 
into convening journalists, it is because the news started to 
circulate in an uncontrolled way after the publication of our 
work in NUOVO CIMENTO (the magazine published by the Italian 
Society of Physics). It is our duty to report exactly what we 
are doing." 
<H5>  Chance Discovery </H5>
  The maximum caution then, but between the folds of the cold 
technical report there is also great enthusiasm about the 
results. We heard from the spokesman for the trio of 
researchers, Prof. Sergio Focardi, a physicist from Bologna 
University, how this new scientific adventure on the most 
controversial and mysterious energy research front began and how 
it is developing. 
  It all started by chance in 1989 when Prof. Francesco 
Piantelli, a biophysicist from Siena University, measured an 
anomalous production of heat while he was carrying out studies 
on samples of organic material (gangliosides) in a hydrogen 
atmosphere on a nickel support. 
  He talked about this with his colleagues, Focardi from 
Bologna and Habel from Cagliari, and together they agreed that 
the possible cause of the thermal anomaly was a reaction between 
the nickel and hydrogen. In fact, under certain physical 
conditions, nickel is a metal that is extremely voracious for 
light gases. Various experiments were carried out, and finally, 
in 1992, the three singled out an "optimal" configuration from 
the point of view of reproducibility and stability. 
  "It is an aluminum cylinder, five centimeters in diameter 
and 
10 centimeters high, that contains a nickel bar and a platinum 
resistance. This small cell is filled with hydrogen at half an 
atmosphere and then sealed. The resistance is switched on. 
When the system reaches 170 degrees it starts to exhibit the 
excess of heat that, even without further introduction of 
hydrogen, lasts for months and months. The power produced is 
about 50W. The energy balance is extraordinarily favorable; the 
little cell releases double the energy put into it." 
<H5>  Nickel and Hydrogen </H5>
  What happens? A hypothesis that has been put forward with a 
thousand cautions by the three researchers, is that, at a 
temperature of 170 degrees, nickel charges itself with hydrogen 
(in the sense that the hydrogen atoms penetrate into its crystal 
lattice). Here, for a physical reason that is still to be 
understood completely, a fusion reaction would take place 
between the nuclei of the atoms of hydrogen (protons) and the 
nuclei of the atoms of heavy hydrogen (protons and neutrons) 
that are naturally contained in hydrogen, in the proportion of 
1:6,000. The reaction would give rise to helium-3 and 
electromagnetic energy that would be absorbed by the crystal 
lattice. The analysis of the hydrogen contained in a small cell 
that has functioned for weeks, was carried out using a mass 
spectrometer and reveals, in fact, a net peak of helium-3. The 
examination of the nickel bar shows that the microscopic 
structure of the metal appears to be devastated. 
  The three researchers stress that ordinary chemistry 
certainly cannot explain all this, starting from the energy 
developed that should be 3,000 times less than that which has 
been observed. "At this point it is our duty to continue the 
research, increasing it and extending it to other laboratories," 
announced Rector Berlinguer. He also referred to the noteworthy 
interest that has been shown in the experiment by Italian 
industry and, in particular, to a proposal of collaboration put 
forward by Fiat. The adventure continues.

<F P=106> [Brian Foster report: "No Less Super -- The Next Step for </F>
Europe's Particle Physics"] 
  [Text] Last October the U.S. Congress finally pulled the 
plug on the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The SSC was 
designed primarily to elucidate the mechanism by which 
elementary particles acquire mass. In order to do this, the SSC 
would have consisted of a large accelerator capable of colliding 
protons at energies 20 times larger than currently available. 
While almost no one in the U.S. questioned the fact that the 
SSC would have been a superb scientific instrument, in the end 
it was sacrificed on the altar of the budget deficit. It is 
estimated that the final cost to the U.S. taxpayer could be as 
high as $4 billion. 
  The termination of the SSC has thrown long-term plans for 
the 
future of particle physics into confusion. A series of meetings 
in the last few months at CERN, the European centre for particle 
physics research in Geneva, has surveyed the new landscape. 
<H5>  Enter the LHC </H5>
  The only proposal now capable of ensuring that we can throw 
light on the origin of mass is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), 
planned to be constructed at CERN. Since it will operate in the 
same tunnel as the Large Electron Position (LEP) collider, it 
will be much cheaper than the SSC was projected to be. 
  The LHC design document has now been produced and it is 
clear 
that there are technically no outstanding questions hindering 
its approval. Chris Llewellyn Smith, an eminent UK physicist 
and the new director-general of CERN, has outlined the project 
strategy The intention is to construct the LHC from within the 
current CERN Budget -- contributed to by all member states in 
proportion to their net national incomes. 
  He believes that construction could be achieved without 
extra 
resources provided that CERN is allowed to take out small 
"bridging loans," either from member states in the form of 
advanced subscription payments, or from banks. These would 
allow the smoothing out of the peaks in expenditure which are 
inevitable in large projects and permit construction within a 
constant budget. Completion would be in 2002 and any necessary 
loans would be paid off by 2006. If extra contributions were 
available, for instance from non-member states, then naturally 
the situation would become even more favourable. 
  Llewellyn Smith has already warned that these timescales are 
long ones, and that prompt approval is both desirable and 
necessary to maintain momentum and to ensure that the essential 
groups of engineers and physicists can continue work on the 
project. Preliminary steps towards this goal were taken at the 
CERN Council meeting last December and, although some 
delegations -- including those of the UK and Germany -- 
expressed reservations, it currently seems hopeful that these 
can be overcome and that approval for the project can be gained 
at the next Council meeting in June. 
<H5>  Attractive Proposition </H5>
  Curiously, one problem which currently might stand in the 
way 
of LHC approval is the demise of the SSC. It might seem that 
the disappearance of a competing project should make things 
easier. But the problem lies in the attractiveness and 
popularity of the LHC. Many U.S. and Japanese physicists who had 
intended to work on the SSC now wish to work on the LHC. 
However, CERN is primarily a European facility and the 
admission of a large contingent of U.S. and other 
non-member-state physicists is therefore far from simple. 
  An overview of the current state of U.S. particle physics 
was 
given at a meeting of the European Committee for Future 
Accelerators in December by Stan Wojciki, chairman of the 
prestigious panel which advises the U.S. Department of Energy on 
particle physics. Clearly, the demise of the SSC, which was the 
major future project in the U.S., has been a very traumatic 
event. Many U.S. groups who were taking a lead in the SSC 
experimental preparations are now searching for a future 
activity. Although the U.S. is still operating successful 
accelerators, particularly at Fermilab near Chicago, their 
lifetime is limited to a few more years at best. New U.S. 
initiatives will necessarily be on a much smaller scale than the 
SSC. All of this points to increased U.S. participation in CERN, 
in particular the LHC project. However, such participation 
would have to be agreed upon by the U.S. Congress. Having just 
cut off funding for a U.S.-based accelerator, it is difficult to 
imagine Congress voting to bind itself to spending substantial 
sums of money over an indefinite period to allow its physicists 
to decamp to Europe and engage in high-tech activities with some 
of its biggest economic competitors. Nevertheless, it is clear 
that U.S. participation in the LHC can only take place if there 
is an equitable financial contribution both to LHC construction 
and to the running of CERN. 
  This is also true of Japan. Japanese plans for particle 
physics imply no firm commitment to making an immediate 
financial contribution to CERN, although this could well be 
forthcoming in the longer term. 
  The problem of allowing access to CERN by scientists from 
non-member states could be solved in a variety of ways. For 
instance, CERN could be fully internationalized to become a 
world laboratory for particle physics. Alternatively, a new 
world organization, of which CERN would become one of a number 
of regional centres, could be set up. Finally, the structure 
and membership of CERN could be left essentially unchanged and 
non-member states allowed to participate in any of all of the 
CERN programmes by a number of ad- hoc bilateral agreements. 
  There are enormous problems with the first two options. Full 
internationalization of CERN would produce an unwieldy 
organization without a strong regional identity. Many member 
states are understandably reluctant to sacrifice CERN's states 
as one of the few unambiguously successful pan-European 
institutions. The second option is likely to be a very long and 
complicated procedure given that, as yet, there is no clear 
blueprint for the form of such an international organization, 
nor for any umbrella organization it might operate under. 
  Nevertheless, there is a growing feeling among the physics 
community that this is a desirable goal for the long term, if 
only to avoid the waste of resources inherent in disasters such 
as the cancellation of the SSC. It is sobering to realize that 
the amount of money which will have been spent by the time the 
SSC is properly terminated would have sufficed to fund the 
entire CERN programme, including the LHC construction, for about 
a decade. Many physicists are now bending their minds to find 
ways of achieving an organization which would strengthen the 
international dimension of the subject while preserving the best 
features of proven institutions such as CERN. 
  The third option -- concluding ad-hoc bilateral agreements 
-- 
is the only practicable one in the short term. However, it is 
essential that the approval of CERN's future programme is not 
made contingent on the successful conclusion of any such 
agreements. it seems very unlikely that, for example, U.S. 
funding could be available for LHC participation before FY96. 
<H5>  Positive Contribution </H5>
  The LHC is technically now ripe for approval: It could be 
built within CERN's own financial resources, to which any 
non-member-state contribution would be helpful but not 
essential, and it is imperative that it be approved soon if the 
momentum and cohesion of the teams of physicists and engineers 
who will build it and perform its experiments are not to be 
lost. In the next few months European governments, the UK 
prominent among them, will have the chance to approve a project 
that will ensure the pre-eminence of European particle physics 
for the forseeable future. 
  More importantly, a positive decision will result in timely 
construction, at no extra cost to the taxpayer, and thereby 
provide the only instrument that we can be certain will help us 
to understand why the universe has mass.

<F P=106> [Sally Croft article: "Employment: JET Goes Critical"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Moves by the European Parliament to remedy the 
plight of British scientists working on the JET [Joint European 
Torus] European fusion project near Oxford could lead to the 
experimental programme grinding to a halt in April, and closure 
of the project later this year, if a long-standing industrial 
dispute is not resolved. 
  In an attempt to force the hand of the European Commission, 
the Parliament voted in December to hold back a third of the 
1994 European fusion budget plus ECU2 million (&pound;1.6 
million) 
to compensate British staff for discrimination they have 
suffered in the past. The Parliament said it is withholding the 
ECU59 million until the parties concerned are seen to be 
cooperating with goodwill and determination to resolve the 
underlying problems. [passage omitted] 
  As the JET project draws to its scheduled close in 1996 and 
the AEA [Atomic Energy Agency] heads for privatization, the 220 
British staff are becoming increasingly concerned about their 
chances of getting a job on JET's successor project, ITER 
[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], or elsewhere 
in the Commission -- external candidates are only permitted when 
there are no suitable internal applicants. On top of that, the 
AEA says that its staff must resign before applying for Euratom 
posts, a position endorsed by JET's ruling council. "Out of the 
50 engineers and scientists appointed to ITER, so far about 20 
people from JET have been selected, but only one of them is 
British -- and he's an administrator," said one senior JET 
physicist. [passage omitted] 
  The European Parliament's decision to withhold one-third of 
the 1994 fusion budget is now beginning to bite. Although the 
funding freeze has been spread across all the Commission's 
fusion laboratories, JET is suffering a shortage of ECU28 
million out of its ECU100 million budget. "Things are nearing a 
critical stage," says George O'Hara, director for administration 
at JET. "From 1 April we will have to start laying off staff 
and making other cuts." [passage omitted] 
  At JET, O'Hara says, "it's impossible to be either 
optimistic 
or pessimistic at this stage, but I don't believe the project 
will come to an end because of this wrangle." But Andreas Pott 
[European Parliament Budget Committee secretary] sounds a note 
of warning: "If they try to keep the project going by saving 
money, they will be creating a very bad precedent for the next 
project, when it comes to justifying how much money is needed."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Telecommunications: `Trans Europe </F>
Line' now in Service"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS 
Database] 
  [Text] The first section of the "Trans Europe Line," a vast 
project launched by German giant Deutsche Telekom to link 
Frankfurt with the main urban centres of East Europe and the 
Balkans by means of an optical-fiber cable network, was brought 
into service on January 13. This first section links Frankfurt, 
Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest, as well as branching 
into Croatia, Slovenia and Austria. Some 3,700 km of cable have 
been laid, and the final project is expected to cover 14,000 km 
in all. 
  Trans Europe Line (TEL) is likely to eventually reach as far 
as Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Moldavia, 
and talks are currently in progress on a possible extension to 
Moscow and to Helsinki, according to Deutsche Telekom Director 
Gerd Tenzer. Around DM700 million is being invested in the 
project, the consortium for which includes 14 telecommunications 
companies. 
  Deutsche Telekom first floated the idea of a trans-European 
cable network in 1990. The various West European telecom 
companies, such as BT, France Telecom and Belgacom which are 
involved are not equity partners in the project, but will be 
buying transmission capacity on the network to cover their 
needs. "Germany sees itself as the hub of East-West 
communications in Europe," declared Mr. Tenzer, and explained 
that there was a need in East Europe for 60 million telephone 
connections, representing investment totalling US$150 billion. 
  The Deutsche Telekom spokesman also explained that TEL is 
not 
a German foreign investment set-up, but that each country was 
financing infrastructure work on its own territory by means of 
bank loans or partnership agreements. Deutsche Telekom, on the 
strength of its wide experience in modernising the former East 
German networks, is offering its know-how, but will be entitled 
to transmission rights only for the cable actually laid under 
German soil. Mr. Tenzer stressed that existing cable systems 
running into East Europe are completely outdated. 
  Apart from TEL, Deutsche Telekom is also working on some 30 
other projects to develop communications sytems in East European 
countries and is currently in talks with the Russian company 
Rosttelecom on construction of a digital system to link 50 
Russian cities with some 50,000 km of fiber optic cable.

<F P=106> [Article by Thierry Outrebon: "Network Interconnection: </F>
Cisco Banking on ATM and Software"] 
  [Text] Cisco presents its first ATM [Asynchronous 
Transfer Model] router and adopts a strategy based on 
software. 
  Building upon a close cooperation with Japan's NEC, Cisco, 
the world's leading manufacturer of routers, has made a 
full-scale entry into ATM, and particularly with respect to 
switching. From this viewpoint, the company will market a 
stand-alone ATM switcher, manufactured by NEC, and a card for 
its 7000 router. The 16-port ATM switcher meets ATM Forum 
specifications, which include the more classic 155 Mbits/sec 
data transfer rate of the Sonet SDH interface. 
  The ATM card designed for the 7000 router, and designated 
the 
AIP (ATM Interface Processor), is due to be on the market 
beginning in May. According to Cisco, this array will be the 
first such configuration able to link traditional networks with 
ATM networks. These two products comprise the third 
developmental phase of Cisco's entry into the ATM market. In 
October 1992, ADC Kentrox and Cisco jointly launched a 
router/DSU designed for the SMDS network. This was the first 
network in the United States to operate cells comparable to 
those of the ATM. Around the beginning of last year, a true 
ATM/DSU switcher appeared that was capable of converting frames 
into cells. This device was developed jointly by Cisco, Kentrox, 
and Digital Link. Apparently, those first two products and the 
cooperation agreements that preceded them have been scrapped in 
favor of Cisco's agreement with NEC. The planned AIP card for 
the 7000 is comprised of three subassemblies. The main one, 
which does the processing, is based on two RISC [Reduced 
Instruction Set Computer] processors manufactured by Mips 
Computers. The "dissection" of the ATM cells (segmentation and 
reassembly) is done inside the FRED [figure-reader electronic 
device] component, developed by the NET/Adaptive company. 
Input/output operations are controlled by an AMD Taxi processor 
in the 100 Mbits/sec case, and by a PMC/Sierra-manufactured 
processor in that of the Sonet interface. 
  Cisco is also planning to make available for its 7000 router 
another so-called Ethernet switching card. An Ethernet switching 
unit, called Catalyst and made by Crescendo, will also be 
available. Cisco acquired Crescendo, known mainly for its CDDI 
[Cable Distributed Data Interface] (FDDI [Fiber Distributed Data 
Interface] on twisted pair) cards, in October 1993. The 
particularity of this second card is that it provides, on the 
one hand, a 100-Mbits/sec CDDI output, and eight 10 Mbits/sec 10 
BaseT input ports. Each station connected to the switcher can 
therefore operate at a real-time rate of 10 Mbits/sec. 
<H5>  Software Turnaround </H5>
  In addition to these product announcements, Cisco is 
highlighting its new architecture, Cisco Fusion, which tends to 
separate the software's routing function from the switching unit 
itself. In effect, as networks have evolved, the growing 
consumption of passband has driven the manufacturers of 
concentrators to dedicate circuits to a single station. This is 
the case, for example, of the new Catalyst switcher. Certain 
Ethernet switchers are now referred to as "single-station" 
switchers. As a result, the notion of routing as it was 
previously known (with searching a table to locate the addresses 
of best access) is losing its interest, since the search has 
been reduced to its simplest expression. In due time, therefore, 
software associated with switchers will be replacing 
top-of-the-line routers. 
  On the occasion of its agreement with Alcatel providing for 
the supply of a PABX routing card, Cisco announced that it saw 
its future essentially in software. Its cooperation agreement 
with Microsoft further demonstrated this. Cisco has provided 
Microsoft a routing software for its Windows server, together 
with a customized card. The next stage, says the firm's European 
head, Philippe Brawermann, will consist of a number of 
agreements with several suppliers of hardware.

  [Text] The ESA [European Space Agency] has assigned the 
contract for development of the robot controller for space 
applications to an industrial team led by the company 
Tecnospazio. A company memorandum underlines the fact that the 
project won the international tender called by the ESA in which 
the major European aerospace corporations participated because 
of the originality of the solution proposed. The solution is 
based on the use of the Comau C3G 9001 controller while the 
decision to adopt an industrial controller to implement the new 
functions required by aerospace applications will guarantee 
reliable results. 
  During the project the new controller is to be integrated in 
the CAT [Columbus automation testbed] robotic system, delivered 
by Tecnospazio to the ESA in 1992. This will permit ground 
tests of the operations programs of the space robot to be 
performed before they are carried out on board. DLR [German 
Aerospace Research Institute] is also contributing to the 
program with responsibility for installing the sensorized 
"hand," which it developed for the Rotex robotic experiment, in 
the new system. 
  Tecnospazio, a European leader in space automation and 
robotics, is a consortium company established by Comau (Fiat 
group) and FIAR (IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of 
Industry] Finmeccanica group).

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "France Preparing Experimental </F>
Telecommunications Satellite for 1988"] 
  [Text] The "Sillard report" recommends the construction of 
a small 1.5-t experimental satellite to test the active antennas 
and an on-board Ku-band switching system as well as a plasma 
power plant running on xenon, AsGa photobatteries, and 
Ni-H[.sub]2[/] batteries. 
  In the exclusive interview recently given to AIR &amp; 
COSMOS, 
Gerard Longuet, French Minister of Industry, Post and 
Telecommunications and of Foreign Trade, announced that the 
project for the construction of an experimental 
telecommunications satellite, as recommended in the report 
forwarded to him by Yves Sillard in December, "is getting my 
approval" (cf., A&amp;C, No. 1543). And, as the former 
delegate-general for armament recommends, the French minister is 
in favor of the Europeanization of the project which, in his 
opinion, links the three main French companies concerned: 
Alcatel Espace, Aerospatiale, and Matra Marconi Space (MMS). All 
that remains to be done now is to find ways of financing the 
satellite against the background of the current economic 
situation; according to the report, the satellite could be built 
for a price tag of between Fr2.5 to 2.8 billion and could be 
launched by Ariane by mid-1998. 
  The Sillard report emphasizes the need for rapidly embarking 
on this technological program in order to support French 
industry both regarding launch vehicles and payloads in 
telecommunications "against the background of the major effort 
undertaken by the United States and Japan." France is already 
seriously behind in this field, while Japan is getting ready to 
launch an ambitious technological satellite, the ETS-6, this 
year with a new rocket, the H2; and the United States is about 
to orbit its experimental satellite, the ACTS. 
  Among the various possible space telecommunications 
missions, 
the Sillard team decided to give priority to experimentation in 
a stationary earth orbit (the more classical one) which involves 
"the most important medium-term stakes for our industry." The 
CNES [National Center for Space Studies], by the way, had 
already launched a modest effort in the field of low-orbit 
radio-forwarding satellites with the Taos project (the old S70) 
in which Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi Space (MMS) are 
associated. 
<H5>  New Technologies </H5>
  However, considering both the rather limited financial 
resources on the national level and the urgency of checking out 
the key technologies in flight--technologies which French 
industry will really need between now and the end of the 
decade--the Sillard report prefers to make a "realistic" 
recommendation. This involves a small satellite that is to test 
a Ku-band payload consisting of "active" electronic antennas and 
on-board switching produced by Alcatel Espace with--for the 
first time in Europe--a plasma-powered electric propulsion 
system using the motors developed in cooperation with the 
Russian firm of Fakel through SEP [European Propulsion Company] 
(cf., A&amp;C, No. 1434). All of this is to be mounted on a mixed 
platform which--and this is rather exceptional--would be built 
jointly by Aerospatiale and Matra Marconi Space , by 
hybridization of their Eurostar Spacebus 1000 "triaxial" launch 
platforms. 
  The proposed experimental satellite would use this mixed 
platform featuring a modular architecture made with an 
aluminum-carbon sandwich (with a new fiber) and lighter wiring 
(using aluminum wires and subminiaturized connectors). The 
structure is made up of flat panels connected to a central tube 
enclosing the two tanks (pressurized with helium) of the 
(chemical) two-fuel propulsion system. It would serve both for 
orbital transfer and control with a 400-N motor and for triaxial 
attitude control of the satellite with small 10-N boosters 
which, if necessary, would in particular ensure North-South 
stabilization; in other words, in case the experimental plasma 
propulsion system (using xenon) with its two SEP Mk2 motors 
should fail. Triaxial attitude control (at close to 0.05ë), 
also using a kinetic wheel with magnetic bearings and a new 
technique for shifting the satellite's center of gravity (by 
orienting the solar panels), as well as an autonomous navigation 
system using the Navstar/GPS satellites. 
  The platform will furthermore be equipped with autonomous 
on-board management with a central-type 1750 computer (with 
remotely chargeable software) linked by a large-volume busbar to 
the peripherals of the payload and the servo units: command, 
power supply, stabilization, and heat control. For the platform, 
it will employ the passive, paint-based technique, insulation 
coatings, preheaters and optical reflectors (OSR) with active 
means for the payload: fluid loops with capillary pumping for 
the active antennas and heat conductors with constant 
conductance coupled to deployable radiators. Electric power 
supply will come through a lightweight solar generator (GSR-3 
type) with two deployable wings, each having two airfoils: one 
with Si photobatteries and the other one with AsGa cells (on a 
Ge substrate). Oriented by electrical motors, the panels will be 
deployed entirely from the transfer orbit and will supply 1.6 kW 
for their service life which is three years. The circuit will be 
permanently regulated by means of class 100-Ah nickel-hydrogen 
(Ni-H[.sub]2[/]) batteries. 
  The experimental payload will consist of two active Ku-band 
antennas: one for broadcasting and the other one for receiving, 
comprising, respectively, 46 and 32 modules distributed over 
900mm or 600mm square panels. On the Europe (and with 
reconfiguration via remote control from the ground), each plate 
antenna will be able to make up four 12-14-GHz beams. They are 
connected to three repeaters with progressive-wave tubes: one 
with filter switching (SAW) in the two 36-MHz channels and the 
other one with wide-band transparent repeater and TOP of 100 W; 
the latter is a regenerative repeater associated with the signal 
processing system by on-board computer with microprocessor 
(OBP). Two options are contemplated for this equipment: either a 
small version (with 4x33 MBits) of the "civilian" OBP developed 
within the context of ESA (which is looking for a satellite for 
in-flight testing), or the "military" OBP (with coding and 
anti-jamming devices) developed by DGA [General Delegation for 
Weapons]. 
<H5>  1.5-t Satellite </H5>
  According to the report, experimentation would be possible 
with a payload of around 220 kg onboard a 600-kg platform and 
with a fuel reserve of 680 kg; that would correspond to a small 
satellite of only 1,500 kg. It could be launched by an Ariane (4 
or 5) rocket at the latest during the first quarter of 1998 if 
the program were to be started in January 1994! 
  On that basis the Sillard team is preparing "a proposal for 
a 
balanced program with a realistic scope" which "would satisfy 
the essential points of the priority objectives established by 
the manufacturers." All of this would be done within an 
acceptable financing context on the national (or European) level 
with an estimated budget on the order of Fr2.5-2.8 billion 
(depending on the type of OBP) for a complete 1.5-t satellite 
(platform and payload) and its launch estimated (with a double 
shot using Ariane) at only Fr300 million. The report also 
studied but did not recommend a more ambitious option (with 
experimentation of equipment using L and Ka bands) with the help 
of a 2.5-t satellite that would cost Fr4.2 billion (including 
launch). In both cases, the cost of the operation would 
essentially (to the extent of three-quarters) be taken care of 
by CNES; the rest would be shared between industry, France 
Telecom and DGA. 
  As he told AIR &amp; COSMOS, the Minister of Industry has 
picked 
the low option, that is, the 1.5-t satellite. But he did so 
without wishing to go into any further detail regarding the 
financing, except to confirm that "the major portion" would, as 
a matter of fact, be financed through CNES. He alerted us, 
however, that it appears "difficult this year to earmark any 
funds for the operation" which he would, however, like to start 
by the end of 1994. Gerard Longuet would like particularly to be 
able to submit the project to Matignon [Office of the Prime 
Minister] in the spring on the basis of the case folder which 
the CNES will have prepared in the meantime. 
  According to the Sillard report, project management--which 
would accommodate both civilian and military concerns--should be 
handled by a program committee reporting to the oversight 
ministries (Industry and Defense) and directing the government 
project team which would link France Telecom and DGA under the 
chairmanship of CNES. On the industry side, the project 
executive team--for the first time uniting the three French 
builders as co-subcontractors--would also be run by a committee 
with a rotating chairmanship (to be handled during the first 
year by Alcatel Espace). The project manager (from Matra Marconi 
Space) would be assisted by two deputies, one (from 
Aerospatiale) for the platform, and the other one (from Alcatel 
Espace) for the payload. The satellite would first of all be 
built in Toulouse (by Matra) and it would then be assembled at 
Cannes (by Aerospatiale). Of course, the actual manufacturing 
job would draw heavily on French equipment makers, such as 
Dassault Eletronique (rapid numerical processing on 
hyperfrequency, electronic scanning antennas), Sagem [General 
Electricity and Mechanics Applications Company] (inertial 
sensors), Sextant (power distribution and control), Sodern 
(optical sensors), SAFT [Company for Fixed and Traction Storage 
Batteries] (batteries), SEP (solar panel orientation motors, 
plasma engine), Thomson (components, TOP), etc. 
  However, "in an effort to be wide open and competitive," it 
would also be desirable "to get foreign industrialists involved 
in those particular areas where they are the habitual partners 
of French firms," the report emphasized. It was noted that this 
might involve firms in Germany (DASA [German Aerospace 
Company]), Belgium (ETCA), or Britain (MMS-UK). 
  Longuet adopted this recommendation; he hoped that "France 
will retain its role as major project organizer" and noted that 
"the project must from the very beginning be wide open to 
European participation!"

<H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5>
<H5>  Limited Experimentation </H5>
  The Sillard report strongly recommends that France build an 
experimental telecommunications satellite. But it did so 
anticipating the (very real) budget constraints that persuaded 
it to propose a "realistic" and, hence, "minimal" solution. 
Specifically, this would involve a "little" satellite weighing 
only 1.5-t, at a price tag of Fr2.5 billion, not the (perhaps 
entirely too?) ambitious project--which one might have expected 
in the old days--calling for a more complete satellite (with 
experimentation also in the L and Ka bands, in addition to one 
in Ku band that was picked) and whose cost would be Fr4.2 
billion. 
  But is it really too much for France, and above all for 
Europe, to afford (not even once per decade) some 
experimentation for the coming missions (on the L and Ka bands)? 
Especially on a satellite that would be launched in 1998, but 
whose first technological check-out phase would not end until 
2001! 
  In the meantime, Japan--not to mention the United 
States--will this year launch a huge 3.8-t takeoff weight 
experimental satellite (2 t in a stationary earth orbit), using 
its new H2 rocket. This ETS-6 should test mobile communications 
at 2.5 GHz, and fixed services at 20-30 and 38-43 GHz, as well 
as optical inter-satellite links (via laser) at 0.5-0.8 microns 
and radio at 2 and 23-32 GHz. But that would also include a 
plasma engine running on xenon. All of that is starting in 1994. 
  On top of that, another experimental satellite of the same 
size, the COMETS, is already being built. It will test 
interactive TV and interorbital links at 22-27 GHz and mobile 
links at 20-30 and 40-50 GHz. That satellite should be launched 
in 1997-1998, again using the H2 rocket, around the same time as 
the little French 12-14-GHz satellite. "Under these conditions, 
who will be among the world space telecommunications leaders by 
the year 2000?" asks Pierre Langereux.

<F P=106> [Letter from the SAX Satellite Steering Committee to IL </F>
SOLE-24 ORE: "But SAX Is Still Valid"] 
  [Text] We would like to reply to the letter from Professor 
Ruffini published in IL SOLE-24 ORE on 12 January. Without 
entering into details concerning the statements made by 
Professor Ruffini we will limit ourselves to expounding some 
essential points regarding the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] 
program. 
<H5>  1 -- The Scientific Profile of the Mission </H5>
  The qualifying characteristics of SAX are its ability to 
make 
simultaneous observations of celestial X-sources over an 
extremely wide energy band covering three decades from 0.2 keV 
(kilo electronvolt) to 200 keV, a bandwidth that has never been 
simultaneously explored before. One of the preeminent aspects 
of the sky seen in X-rays, as appears from the observed 
panorama, is its extreme variability with respect to time. The 
key factor in obtaining a consistent picture of the processes 
occurring in the sources, based on the possibility of effecting 
simultaneous spectral measurements over the widest range of 
bands obtainable, is obtained by SAX by using a scientific 
package made up of a well-balanced group of sensors, that 
together give unquestionable superiority and the possibility of 
contextual reconstruction of the energy spectrum over all the 
bandwidth. 
<H5>  2 -- The Scientific Instruments On Board SAX </H5>
  The scientific package of SAX includes a set of innovative 
elements, based on leading-edge techniques: grazing incidence 
X-optics obtained by using a nickel electroplating process. 
This technique, which was developed in Italy for SAX, has been 
successively used for the Jet-X telescopes in the Russian 
mission Spectrum X-Gamma and in the mission ESA-XMM [X-ray 
Multiple Mirror]. 
  Spectrometers with image sensors based on scintillating gas 
proportional meters, with a sensitivity that is comparable to 
that of CCD [charge coupled device] sensors. 
  A high-pressure scintillating gas proportional meter that 
operates with characteristics of energy sensitivity and 
resolution that have never been achieved before. 
  A high-performance photodischarge (PDS) crystal sensor. 
  Wide range X-observation cameras, that are the most 
sophisticated type of blackout camera developed to the present 
day. 
<H5>  3 -- Comparison With the Satellites for X-Astronomy That Are </H5>
Currently Operational or At the Planning Stage 
  When SAX is considered in comparison with the two 
X-astronomy 
missions currently in orbit (the German Rosat [Roentgen 
Satellite] and the Japanese ASCA), its scientific profile is 
competitive and largely complementary. 
  As far as future missions are concerned, NASA's XTE mission 
is limited to energies above 2 keV. 
  The ESA's XMM and NASA's AXAF [Advanced X-ray Astrophysical 
Facility] are planned to go into orbit four or five years after 
SAX. As missions of the observation type belong to the next 
generation, they will present a substantial advance with respect 
to previous X-astronomy missions. 
  Anyway SAX will continue to be unique in terms of the width 
of the band covered, this simply cannot be attained by any other 
mission underway or currently being planned. 
<H5>  4 -- Considerations on the Launching Date </H5>
  The program for the realization of SAX is now well-defined 
and the details have been settled. The nominal launching date, 
using an Atlas Centaur from the Cape Canaveral base, is set for 
22 December 1995. Negative comments about delays to the program 
over the years are often made by the critics of the SAX program, 
delays that would deteriorate the scientific validity of the 
mission and would be characteristic only of SAX and not of other 
missions. 
  As far as the presumed "aging" of SAX is concerned, the 
argument is an excuse. As far as the time delays are concerned, 
it is illustrative to look at the reference dates of some of the

<H5>  5 -- Consideration on Costs </H5>
  SAX is a sophisticated satellite with high-profile 
technological instrumentation. Its cost, when compared with 
similar European projects, is completely in line with them and 
is not at all excessive or abnormal. 
  Some "critical" voices of SAX present the evolution of the 
cost of the mission, from the amount that was originally 
estimated in 1981 to that of today, in a deliberately confused 
way. 
  A correct evaluation must take account of: 
  a) The initial cost that was estimated at 100 billion lire 
in 
1981 and that would correspond to about 300 billion lire in 1994; 
  b) Following the Challenger disaster in 1986 the SAX mission 
had to be radically replanned and reoriented to be launched 
using an expendable Atlas-Centaur carrier (that currently costs 
over 100 billion lire) instead of using the NASA spacecraft (at 
zero cost to the program); 
  c) The current cost goes back to the contractual stage 
negotiated in 1989 and has not changed much since that date. 
<H5>  6 -- Participation of the Scientific Community </H5>
  From the hardware point of view (scientific 
instrumentation), 
six research institutes are participating in the program, four 
of these are in Italy and two are abroad, all together about 30 
technicians and researchers are involved, an analogous number of 
researchers are dealing with the software part (data analysis 
and preparation of observation programs). We are therefore 
dealing with a group of highly qualified scientists, that is 
anything but small for this preparatory stage of the mission. 
The community that is interested in the observation data 
obtained from the satellite when it is in orbit will naturally 
be much vaster. Johan A.M. Bleeker, director SRON-Utrecht;

<F P=106> [Article by Christel Tardif: "Europe Invests In Study of </F>
Cryogenic Engines"] 
  [Text] Two test benches are being built to help 
understand the physico-chemical combustion process in the 
engines of space launchers. One is in Germany (a cooperative 
effort by the DLR, the CNES [National Center for Space Studies], 
DASA [Deutsche Aerospace], and the SEP [European Propulsion 
Company]) and the other is at the ONERA [National Office for 
Aerospace Studies and Research]. 
  Using liquid hydrogen as a fuel leads to better performance 
in terms of specific impulse, and that finding is now being put 
to use in the engines of space launchers to obtain what are 
called cryogenic engines. 
  The SEP tackled cryogenics in the 1970's when it was 
developing the engine for Ariane IV (the HM7B). Today it is 
working with DASA to develop Vulcain, the cryogenic main engine 
in Ariane V, which is scheduled to fly in 1995 (100 bar of 
pressure and 100 tonnes of thrust). 
  Development of those two engines could not be based on a 
thorough knowledge of the physico-chemical combustion process. A 
very definite effort is still needed to become familiar with the 
process and decide how to respond to any possible difficulties 
(for example, the failure of the V15 and V18 due to an ignition 
problem). The stakes are considerable: it is a matter of 
reliability. 
  Two test benches known as P8 and Mascotte are currently 
being 
set up. They are essential tools that will soon strengthen the 
research efforts that have been underway since 1988 as part of a 
Coordinated Research Program involving the CNES, the CNRS 
[National Scientific Research Center], and the SEP (the ONERA 
being part of the scientific council). 
  P8 is being set up in Germany and should be operational by 
the spring of 1995. The civil engineering portion of that 
project by the DLR (50 percent), the CNES (30 percent), DASA (10 
percent), and the SEP (10 percent) has been completed, and 
construction of the actual test bench is just beginning. A 
dual-purpose bench, it will be used both for technological 
development (80 percent) and for basic research (20 percent). 
Talks are underway to set up a French-German research program 
for use of the bench. 
  With a chamber pressure of 250 bar, P8 will have a flow 
capacity of 8 kg/s of liquid oxygen and 1.5 kg/s of liquid 
hydrogen. 
  For its part, Mascotte (Simplified Autonomous Assembly for 
Cryogenic Combustion in Oxygen and Any Experimental Technology) 
is being set up in Palaiseau. Its first research season should 
take place during this first quarter of 1994. This test bench, 
which is partly covered for security reasons, is a self-financed 
investment by the ONERA. Operating at a much lower cost, it is 
intended for qualitative qualification, the refinement of less 
expensive technologies, and the development of materials and 
technology. P8 will very certainly use what is developed by 
Mascotte and be used for quantitative qualification. 
  ONERA, CNES, SEP, and CNRS are currently finalizing an 
agreement to establish a research group for the use of Mascotte. 
It will be a Franco-French structure, but its development into a 
French-German structure is not out of the question. 
  Mascotte will produce a flow of up to 100 g/s of liquid 
oxygen (stored at ambient temperature, 300 K) at a pressure 
limited to 10 bar because of the liquid oxygen reserve (stored 
at from 90 to 110 K). Changes are planned to allow experiments 
at higher pressures (100 bar is conceivable). 
  The first test assemblies have been completed, and 
experiments with oxygen injection have been conducted. 
Experiments with actual combustion cannot be far behind. 
  One major problem to be dealt with is the injector. It must 
manage the transformation of the fluid into a spray in such a 
way as to increase surface area while preventing surface 
instabilities.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Order for Last 20 Ariane 4's </F>
and First 14 Ariane 5's in 1994"] 
  [Text] Arianespace is starting production of all the 
Ariane 4's now planned and will order the first 14 
series-produced Ariane 5's this year. It hopes to reduce 
production costs by 30 percent. 
  By the end of the year, Arianespace will have put in an 
order 
for the last 20 of the batch of 50 Ariane 4 rockets that went 
into production four years ago (batch P9) and started production 
on the first 14 series-produced Ariane 5's intended for 
operational flights that the launch firm will carry out by the 
year 2000. That was one of the main "messages" which Charles 
Bigot, Arianespace's chief executive officer, conveyed last 
week--through the press--at the same time that he reported the 
company's "excellent operating results" for 1993 (see AIR &amp; 
COSMOS, No. 1454). 
  Last year, despite a late start (12 May) caused by the 
unavailability of a satellite from Hughes (United States), the 
launch firm successfully completed seven scheduled launches 
putting 10 large satellites into orbit. The result is that 
Arianespace's turnover will be "on the order of Fr4.5 billion," 
with profits "equivalent to those in 1992." 
  But most important, Arianespace signed 16 new firm satellite 
launch contracts last year, whereas its competitors as a whole 
received only six orders. Those 16 contracts cover satellite 
launches with a total value of about Fr7 billion and bring the 
backlog of orders to 37 satellites to be launched at a total 
value of Fr16.9 billion (as of 1 January 1994). This does not 
include the order from Intelsat that is currently being 
negotiated for the launching of two more Intelsat 8's (F3 and 
F4) in addition to the first two (F1 and F2), which have already 
been entrusted to Ariane 4, or the three second-generation 
Meteosat satellites covered by the signing on 10 January of the 
first "convention" (or framework agreement) between Arianespace 
and the European organization Eumetsat [European Organization of 
Meteorology via Satellite] for launching the new MSG's between 
the years 2000 and 2006. 
  Because of its "very full" order book, Arianespace has 
decided to order from its manufacturers the last two series of 
rockets in the P9 batch of 50 Ariane 4's--all of which will 
therefore be produced--and simultaneously to speed up the pace 
at which Ariane 4's are produced, going from the current eight 
rockets per year to nine and then to 10 per year in 1994 and 
1995. 
  "Production will increase by at least 50 percent over three 
years," Bigot announced. The reason, he said, is that "the goal 
is to launch 30 rockets in 36 months." That is 50 percent more 
than were launched over the past two years. "It will require a 
big industrial effort," he said, "because we must allow for the 
unexpected and therefore be prepared to make considerably more 
than one launch per month in order to guarantee 10 flights per 
year." And it must be done without altering launch preparation 
procedures. Because, as Bigot stressed, "we must not jeopardize 
the `Ariane operational product,' which has now reached a 
satisfactory level of quality." 
  The solution, then, consists of shortening production and 
launch times. As a result, the average time frame for launching 
an Ariane 4, which formerly included a minimum interval of 22 
working days, has been reduced to 20 days. The feasibility of 
this new schedule was demonstrated at the end of 1993, and it 
will enable Arianespace to launch 10 Ariane 4's per year from 
1994 to 1996. 
<H5>  15 Ariane 5's Marketed </H5>
  In addition, Arianespace has already started negotiating 
contracts with manufacturers for series production of the new 
Ariane 5 [AR5] launcher. At the end of October, the European 
agency asked the firms concerned to make a special effort to 
reduce manufacturing costs "by an average of at least 30 
percent" (see AIR &amp; COSMOS, No. 1446). 
  "All the manufacturers concerned received a letter from 
Arianespace establishing two objectives with respect to cost 
reductions: one for the first 14 series-produced rockets (after 
the two very first rockets, which are part of the development 
program) and the other for the rest of the series beginning with 
the 15th AR5. 
  Bigot told us that so far, "no manufacturer has achieved 
that 
30-percent reduction." Negotiations will therefore continue--and 
be speeded up--this year because, he said, "we plan to order the 
first batch of 14 AR5's (perhaps in installments) in 1994." 
  The result is that over the next three years, Europe should 
have launched at least the first three Ariane 5's: AR-501 in 
October 1995, followed by 502 and 503 in April and October 1996. 
And according to Arianespace's CEO, "everything is to be in 
order for operational flights beginning in 1997." 
  The next phase, he said, is to be "another three-year period 
during which the AR5 will become increasingly popular, with two, 
three, and then four launches per year (that is, nine rockets 
over a three-year period). That will be followed by the AR5's 
nominal launch rate (reduced since cancellation of the Hermes) 
of five launches per year beginning in 1999. 
  "All of our contracts already stipulate flights with the 
Ariane 5," said Bigot. He explained, however, that at first, 
"AR5 will be offered at the same price (within 3 to 5 percent) 
as Ariane 4," the argument being that Arianespace will sell 
either Ariane 4 or Ariane 5 but will have to compensate for the 
additional cost of the--less than optimal--operation of two 
launchers during the three-year transitional period. The fact is 
that productivity will not be as good during that period, with 
only nine AR5 launches and 9 or 10 Ariane 4 launches. 
  But the transition may proceed faster than expected, said 
Bigot, who explained that the company would take charge of 
marketing Ariane 5 beginning with the second rocket (AR-502). 
The ESA [European Space Agency] has (also) just put that 
launcher on the market, since it is no longer reserved for the 
Artemis experimental relay satellite, development of which is 
already six months behind schedule even though work has just 
begun--meaning that it will no longer be possible to launch 
Artemis (for free) on AR-502. On the contrary, the agency will 
have to pay at least $115 million for space on a commercial AR5 
flight! 
  Arianespace is therefore already preparing to operate about 
15 Ariane 5's, with flight 502--which is still part of the 
Ariane 5 flight qualification program--being marketed especially 
for the ESA. From that point on, Arianespace plans to have only 
double launches of AR5's (and probably no triple launches other 
than on an exceptional basis), while gradually speeding up the 
launch rate to the point that by the end of the decade, there 
will be five launches per year to put 10 satellites--half the 
worldwide market--in orbit. Beginning with European satellites, 
of course, because, as Bigot announced, "currently all the ESA 
projects are being reworked to make them compatible with AR5." 
  But, and this is another new "message" from Bigot, 
"Arianespace also wants to be the firm handling all elements of 
space transportation in Europe," including, he said, the new 
logistic elements of infrastructure or orbital service 
operations such as the ATV "space tug," the CTV manned capsule, 
or the ACRV rescue vessel. 
  But that will depend on the decisions made regarding those 
programs at the next ESA council meeting on 18 January 1994 and 
then at the conference of European ministers early in 1995!

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Arianespace Plans 10 Launches </F>
in 1994"; Subhead: "Exceptional Accomplishment. 10 Ariane 
Launches Scheduled for This Year (and Same Number for Next Two 
Years) to Launch 15 Large Telecommunications Satellites, Half of 
Them Hughes (U.S.) Satellites."] 
  [Text] The European operator is accelerating the tempos for 
production and launching of Ariane 4 beginning this year, and 
for the next two years also, in order to realize 10 launches per 
year and 30 flights in 36 months. This is something never before 
witnessed in Europe and not even among international commercial 
launchers, including the U.S. What is more, among the 15 
commercial satellites being loaded onto the European rocket this 
year are half of the 15 satellites that Hughes (U.S.), the 
world's leading manufacturer of telecommunications satellites, 
is supposed to deliver to its customers in 1994! 
  But in late January at Kourou, Aerospatiale is going to kick 
things off with a double Ariane 4 launch carrying two "Made in 
France" geostationary telecommunications satellites. They are 
the Eutelsat 2/F5 belonging to the European organization 
Eutelsat and, preeminently, the first Turkish satellite, Turksat 
1A, that the French manufacturer is also supposed to deliver in 
orbit to Turkey. As a result, as a direct customer of 
Arianespace, Aerospatiale will therefore, for the first time, 
enjoy the privilege of having its name painted on the European 
rocket for which it is also the principal manufacturer in its 
capacity of industrial architect and project manager. 
  In fact, the contract signed three years ago with Turkey by 
Aerospatiale provides for "turnkey" delivery of two satellites 
launched by Ariane as well as two ground control stations 
(equipped and personnel trained). Therefore, Aerospatiale is 
supposed to deliver the first operationally ready Turksat to the 
Turkish Post and Telecommunications [P&amp;T] towards the end of 
February 1994. 
<H5>  34 Tons of Satellites </H5>
  The launch was scheduled for 20 January but was pushed back 
"a few days" by Arianespace on 17 January in order to check out 
a couple of irregularities in the cryogenic third stage orders 
sequencer that occurred during the previous flight (V62) in 
mid-December 1993.

  This 63rd Ariane flight (in 14 years) will also be the 35th 
AR4 launch (in 5.5 years) since it was put into service in June 
1988. Thirty-three of those 34 launches were successful (97 
percent). 
  V63 will be the 10th launch in the AR44L version. The 419 t 
rocket is supposed to carry a 4179 kg payload (including 
adapter) for launching the 1880 kg Eutelsat 2/F5 and the 1783 kg 
Turksat 1A. The satellites stacked under the shroud will be 
launched (in that order) into orbit at 200-35,934 km/7 degrees 
and then propelled by their own motor into geostationary orbit 
at 36 degrees E and 42 degrees E.

<H5>  Hughes Shows Confidence in Ariane </H5>
  In 1994, Hughes Aircraft will entrust more than half of its 
telecommunications satellites (eight out of 15) to Ariane 4 (see 
table). This is the first time that the American firm, a world 
leader in the sector, will place so many satellites on the 
European rocket. As a result, Ariane will become the world's 
leading launcher of telecommunications satellites with 15 of the 
21-23 "satcoms" (65-71 percent) scheduled for this year. The 
others will be launched by the new Japanese H2 (one), the U.S. 
Delta 2 (one), and the U.S. Atlas (two or three).

  Both of the costly satellites and their launcher will be 
insured through French broker Faugere &amp; Jutheau for a record 
value of $360 million. 
  The next flight (V64), also with an AR44LP, is scheduled for 
23 February, to launch the large 3.7 t Intelsat 7/F2. That will 
be the heaviest one launched this year by Ariane. The least 
heavy will be the Shinawatra (Thailand) Thaicom 2 weighing 1080 
kg. This year the Hughes spun HS-376 will occupy half the Ariane 
flights with eight of its 15 satellites on the European rocket 
that will also launch two satellites manufactured by Martin 
Marietta Astro Space (Telstar 4/F2 and BS-3N) and one by Space 
Systems/Loral (Intelsat 7/F2) for a total of 11 satellites "Made 
in USA" out of 15 (73 percent). The other four satellites will 
be Aerospatiale's own. Total weight of those 15 "satcoms" is 
33.9 t. 
  The ERS-2 also enjoys priority launching this year. But the 
European radar-observation satellite is supposed to be launched 
only in January 1995. Other satellites have also been postponed 
until next year, especially the Measat 1, Amos-1, Italsat 2, 
Telecom-2C, two Intelsat 7A and ISO. 
  By the end of 1994, therefore, Arianespace should have 
launched 72 of the scheduled 99 Arianes, including 44 Ariane 4's 
out of 71 (including 50 from lot P9). Therefore, there will be 
27 Ariane 4's left to launch and 22 of the 37 satellites 
currently on order. This does not include new future orders that 
could lead Arianespace to order (between now and the end of the 
year) a few more additional AR4 to meet the demand before the 
arrival of Ariane 5 in less than two years. The European 
operator has also already planned to order, this year as well, 
the 14 first serial AR5 for operational flights beginning in 
1996 (cf. A&amp;C No. 1455).

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent in Kourou (French Guinea) </F>
Pierre Langereux: "Ariane's Failure Causes the Loss of Turksat 
1A and Eutelsat 2/F5 Satellites"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The shutdown of Ariane 4's cryogenic engine during 
its 63rd flight has caused the loss of two telecommunications 
satellites, the Turksat 1A and Eutelsat 2/F5, which were insured 
for the record amount of 2.2 billion French francs [Fr]. 
Replacement satellites will be ready for launch in July and 
October of 1994, respectively. 
  "On 24 January in Kourou, Arianespace suffered its first 
failure in four years of consecutive successful launches. Over 
the course of those 26 flights, Ariane placed in orbit 40 
European and foreign satellites. Today we have experienced a 
failure! We can accept this without undue distress, because we 
know the launcher is reliable though (unfortunately) not 
perfect." With those remarks, Arianespace CEO Charles Bigot 
summed up the situation after the surprising--and financially 
painful--failure of the European launcher's 63rd flight. It was 
Ariane's sixth failure in just over 14 years, and Ariane 4's 
second failure (out of 35 launches) since starting service in 
June 1988. The misfire abruptly deflates Ariane 4's success rate 
from its previously enviable level of 97.1 percent, to a mere 
94.4 percent! 
  The 24 January failure was the most costly one in the entire 
world history of commercial launches. Indeed, the Ariane 44LP 
carried record insurance of $356 million, or about Fr2.2 
billion, on its twin payload of two, Aerospatiale-built 
telecommunications satellites, the first Turksat 1A and the 
second-to-the-last Eutelsat 2. Mohammed Dhabi, general director 
of Faugere &amp; Jutheau, the broker that insures all Ariane 
launches, says the Eutelsat 2/F5 was covered for about Fr1.1 
billion (170 million accounting units), and the Turksat 1A for 
about the same amount. The contract to insure the two satellites 
had totally depleted the funds available on the world market. 
Charles Bigot further notes that Arianespace's insurance 
department, S3R, had to add $35 million to the $321 million 
collected on the international market (from 87 insurance 
companies). 
  "It is a brutal loss," acknowledges Charles Bigot, who ticks 
off the additional costs of modifying Ariane and of revenues 
lost by the two operators, Europe's Eutelsat and Turkey's 
P&amp;T. 
The satellites of the Turkish postal and telecommunications 
office were made by Aerospatiale in Cannes, with the help of 
Alcatel Espace in Toulouse. 
  Ariane's 63rd flight was the first time Aerospatiale had had 
two of its satellites on board one launcher. In another first, 
the French firm was even granted the privilege--as are all 
direct Arianespace customers--of inscribing its name on the 
European rocket, since it had signed a contract with Turkey to 
place both Turksats in orbit in January and July, 1994, 
respectively. Finally, it was Aerospatiale's--and more broadly, 
any European firm's--first experience with a "turnkey" delivery 
(geostationary-orbit, ready-to-operate satellites), as 
stipulated in the $315 million contract it had signed with the 
Turkish P&amp;T in 1990. 
  The Turkish Minister of Transports and Telecommunications, 
Mehmet Kostepen, had come to watch the launch in Kourou via a 
specially chartered Airbus 340 Aerospatiale and Arianespace had 
reserved for its 150 VIPs. 
  Mr. Kostepen was obviously quite disappointed at Ariane's 
failure, which deprives him of a satellite scheduled to begin 
operating and generating revenues by late February. In 
particular, the Turksat 1A was slated to relay Turkey's four 
national television stations and 10 private ones throughout 
Turkey, Central Europe, and the Middle East. The expanded 
broadcasts are meant to reach 100 million Turkish speakers, and 
to turn the Turksat program, in which Ankara will ultimately 
invest a total of $600 million, into a money-making proposition. 
  But Mehmet Kostepen has not lost confidence in Ariane, 
stating that "the second Turksat should be launched in July" and 
that "God willing, I hope to be in Kourou again to see it 
launched." On the other hand, Eutelsat's general director Jean 
Grenier seemed more affected by the mishap. Grenier certainly 
had no desire to lose his satellite, despite the fact that he 
had protected himself by insuring a Eutelsat 2 for the first 
time. "I don't know what we're going to do," he confided to us 
immediately after the 2/F5's loss. Grenier has not ruled out the 
possibility of ordering an additional Eutelsat 2 to avoid a 
capacity shortfall between now and the arrival of his new "Hot 
Bird Plus," which Aerospatiale and MMS are currently vying to 
build. 
  The botched launch is also "an enormous disappointment" for 
Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois, who had come to watch his first 
Ariane launch. Gallois's group has been the main manufacturer of 
Ariane rockets since 1973. According to him, the failure 
demonstrates that "We are still at the technological development 
phase." This terse comment was an unintentionally harsh 
condemnation of Ariane teams, which were already "bitterly 
disappointed by the accident." Charles Bigot stressed this when 
he "apologized to his customers for the failure" that lost the 
two satellites, which tumbled into the Atlantic off the coast of 
Africa. 
  In a letter written the day after the Ariane accident, 
French 
space minister Gerard Longuet "reaffirmed his personal 
confidence and that of the government" in Arianespace and "the 
entire Ariane program community." The industry minister believes 
that "Ariane will resume its excellent track record without 
delay." 
  So the investigating committee will have to do its job 
thoroughly, but most of all, quickly. Indeed, Arianespace thinks 
that, given the nature of the accident, "There is reason to hope 
for fairly quick diagnosis and corrective measures." Charles 
Bigot has announced that the investigative team will "submit an 
initial report by mid-February"! 
  "Arianespace's priority is to serve its customers," says 
Bigot, adding that, according to the rules, customers that have 
just lost a satellite are given relaunch priority. "Ariane's 
manifest will be altered accordingly," so that the 
(insurance-paid) replacement satellites can be launched as soon 
as possible. But the actual advantage of this policy will be 
slight in this case, at best maintaining the 
previously-scheduled launch dates of the next models, Turksat 1B 
and Eutelsat 2/F6, for July and October, 1994. 
  Aerospatiale Space-Defense Director Michel Delaye has, in 
fact, confirmed that the two satellites will be ready for that 
date. Delaye notes that the Turkish contract requires 
Aerospatiale to provide a replacement satellite to Turkey within 
two years. Moreover, if the second satellite is lost as well, 
the Turkish P&amp;T can demand full reimbursement of the $315 
million. 
  Jean Grenier explained that the Eutelsat 2/F6 was designed 
for a slightly different mission than the 2/F5 (which was 
altered to broadcast to the East), and is not in any case 
scheduled for launch until next October. But perhaps the 
European organization's satellite will be able to cut in ahead 
of its Luxembourg SES competitor's Astra 1D in the fall. 
  In any event, Arianespace aims to "start flying again 
shortly" to "make up the time lost" as a result of the F63 
failure, a delay that is still difficult to calculate exactly. 
  "We have the capacity to speed up our schedule," says 
Charles 
Bigot. The CEO noted that "the operational plan calling for 10 
flights a year over three years beginning in 1994 does not 
require a launch rate of one every five weeks, but just under 
half that." The original schedule was established precisely in 
order to allow for technical, program, or industrial glitches. 
Moreover, says Charles Bigot, on 1 February Arianespace expects 
to unveil a new operational plan "that will accelerate 
operations still more and enable the company to launch rockets 
every three weeks." The new plan will probably require working 
Arianespace teams six out of seven days. 
  The first task of those teams will be to dismantle (and 
perhaps ship back to Europe) the third cryogenic stage that is 
now mounted on the next launcher (F64), scheduled to carry an 
Intelsat 7 on 23 February. Charles Bigot is not willing to 
announce a new launch date, but he hopes that operations will 
resume "in a few weeks." That seems rather optimistic, however, 
and at best specialists believe Ariane will be grounded for at 
least two to three months. All of Ariane's next flights will be 
postponed accordingly, at least for the remainder of 1994. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: An Overheated Bearing Is the Cause of Failure </H5>
  Arianespace's CEO confirmed the day after the launch that 
initial examinations during the night had revealed "a failure 
caused by the premature shutdown of the third-stage engine. 
Eighty seconds post-ignition of the cryogenic stage, the 
pressure in the center of the stage, the pressure from 
outflowing oxygen, and the rotation speed of the liquid-oxygen 
turbopump, which had all been normal until then, slowed for 0.5 
seconds, then dropped abruptly." More specifically, a quick 
survey of recordings shows that, after 60 s of nominal cryogenic 
engine operation, the countersunk bearing of the oxygen pump 
(also cooled by liquid oxygen at 170ëC) become abnormally 
heated. Overheating was slight at first, during two stroke 
operation, then shot up exponentially, quickly exceeding the 
maximum threshold. This surge destroyed the bearing and stopped 
the oxygen turbopump, which was rotating at 13,000 rpm. Francois 
Calaque, the director of Aerospatiale Launchers, privately made 
the same diagnosis immediately after the accident, when only 
preliminary data on the F63 failure were available. The 
accident, Charles Bigot went on to say, "has nothing to do with 
the (four-day) launch postponement decided as a precautionary 
measure (before F63), to correct the (electrical) anamoly 
discovered in an interface case of the previous (F62) launcher's 
module." 
  Now Arianespace must clarify exactly, and as quickly as 
possible, the underlying cause of the accident, which began with 
the destruction of the bearing. As Charles Bigot explains, the 
bearing "acted as a fuse," and engineers must figure out how it 
could have become vulnerable to destruction just one minute 
after ignition of SEP's HM7B cryogenic engine. According to 
Daniel Mugnier, director of Launchers at the National Center for 
Space Studies, the disastrous heating of the bearing was 
apparently due solely to a mechanical overload (which the 
bearing is not designed to tolerate), rather than a purely 
thermal phenomenon. 
  But it will be up to the immediately-formed investigative 
committee to "thoroughly analyze and elucidate the reasons for 
the anamolous operation of the engine," declared Charles Bigot. 
Arianespace's CEO affirmed that "the Ariane system is mature and 
proven, but remains technically fragile." Its cryogenic 
propulsion system in particular, he says, "is more sensitive 
than the rest of the rocket." This is a well-established fact, 
since problems with cryogenic propulsion have unfortunately 
caused five of Ariane's six failures since 1980!

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "European Remote-Sensing </F>
Alliance"] 
  [Text] Four national companies specializing in agricultural 
remote sensing have jointly created Eurofast, the first GEIE 
(European economic interest group). The four companies are: 
France's Sotema (Agricultural Remote-Sensing Company), Germany's 
GAF [expansion not provided](Gesellschaft fur Angewandte 
Fernerkundung), Great Britain's NRSC (National Remote Sensing 
Centre), and Italy's Telespazio, a subsidiary of the IRI-STET 
[Institute for Industrial Reconstruction-Turin Telephone Finance 
Company] group. The Eurofast GEIE will specialize in 
agricultural and forestry applications of satellite imaging. 
  "The creation of Eurofast demonstrates the intent of the 
Europeans to organize as a high-performance remote-sensing 
structure, with sights set on occupying center stage in a 
high-technology sector of the future," said Jean-Claude Cazaux, 
general manager of Sotema, in his 24 January announcement of the 
forming of the new group. 
  Eurofast ("Forestry and Agriculture with Satellite 
Technologies") is expected to improve European potentials for 
assisting various parts of the world in dealing with problems of 
land-use inventories, estimates of agricultural and forestry 
areas, forecasting of harvests, etc. The group will also be able 
to develop its activity in related domains such as the 
environment, and the study or measurement of the impact that 
large-scale projects may have on natural resources. It is thus 
expected to "open up new possibilities for developing 
operational tools for use by rural land administrators, land-use 
planners, and agricultural and forestry policy makers," says 
Sotema. 
  Actually, the four firms are already jointly providing 
satellite remote-sensing services to the European Community, 
particularly under the European MARS pilot project on the use of 
remote sensing for the development of agricultural statistics.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "Germany Pursuing Its </F>
Hypersonic Propulsion Research"] 
  [Text] Having developed the concept of a 
hydrogen-cooled asymmetric two-dimensional exhaust nozzle, MTU 
plans to build a Mach 7 ramjet demonstrator in 1995. 
  German experts are continuing their research to develop a 
propulsion system for their "Sanger" hypersonic orbital plane 
concept. They are working on the basis of a 
liquid-hydrogen-propelled combination turbojet/ramjet engine. 
Consisting of a rectangular air inlet followed by a diffuser, it 
has a turbojet engine equipped with an enclosure system that 
isolates and protects it during the hypersonic phase. It then 
terminates in an afterburner duct that serves as the combustion 
chamber for the ramjet, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle 
with an expansion tail pipe. The turbojet engine propels the 
plane up to approximately Mach 3.5. Then, between Mach 3.5 and 
Mach 3.8, during the transition phase, the ramjet kicks in to 
accelerate the assembly to Mach 7. 
  This hypersonic technology research program began in 1988 
and 
is being conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Research 
and Technology with the participation of the DLR, the "space" 
and "planes" divisions of DASA [Deutsche Aerospace AF], and 
Volvo, all of whom are working under MTU's leadership. Since 
1992, the Russians of the TsAGI have joined the research 
relative to the scramjet technologies. 
  As of today, the definition is almost complete, and testing 
has commenced on the components of the ramjet portion, such as 
the air inlets, combustion chamber, exhaust nozzles, and the 
cooling system, all of which have practically been defined. 
During an initial phase (between 1990 and 1992), the engineers 
had to develop design and simulation software, new 
instrumentation, and the aerodynamic definition of the air 
inlets and combustion chambers. Concurrently, they began testing 
the components. In 1991, they simulated Mach 4.7 with a cooled 
combustion chamber 33 cm in diameter. Then, a hot air generator 
reached 2000 K (corresponding to Mach 7), and in December 1992, 
a cooled ramjet reached Mach 7 (in simulation). 
  Several types of exhaust nozzles (rectangular, axisymmetric) 
were studied and tested. The choice finally boiled down to 
hydrogen-cooled asymmetric two-dimensional exhaust nozzles. 
Under test, they withstood exit temperatures of 2500 K or 
2227ë. A special effort was devoted to the expansion tail 
pipe, whose role is important with respect to the 
engine/fuselage integration. The pipe is protected by 
carbon/carbon. In March 1993, a complete nozzle underwent a 
satisfactory test with 2400 K and 1500 K at the tail pipe. 
  Since the completion of these initial tests on individual 
components, the German researchers have embarked on a new phase. 
It is to culminate in the realization of a complete 
demonstrator, a ramjet engine baptized the TDR 500, by 1995. It 
will be 7 meters long and will consist of an adjustable-section 
rectangular air inlet, a circular combustion chamber 50 cm in 
diameter, and a two-dimensional exhaust nozzle with expansion 
tail pipe. Since facilities capable of testing such an assembly 
are not available in Europe, the tests will be conducted either 
in Russia or in the United States. 
  And in a third phase, the engineers plan to embark on the 
supersonic combustion stage. That is, on the scramjet engine 
that is to be studied in cooperation with the German DLR and the 
Russian TsAGI.

  [Text] The EEC is financing half the construction costs of 
the vegetation-observing radiometer to be built by Aerospatiale 
for the French SPOT 4 satellite. Launch is scheduled for 1997. 
  On 17 January the European Commission, represented by 
Jean-Pierre Contzen, director of Italian Ispra's Joint Research 
Center (CCR), and CNES [National Center for Space Studies], 
represented by its director general, Jean-Daniel Levi, signed a 
cooperation accord that involves the European Community in 
realization of the "Vegetation" instrument destined for France's 
SPOT 4 observation satellite to be launched in mid-1997. 
  Under the accord, the European Community will cofinance 
construction of the Vegetation instrument, for which 
Aerospatiale will be prime contractor, and as such responsible 
to CNES. The program is being expanded to allow for the 
participation of France, Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, with 
subcontracts for the project going to manufacturers in these 
countries. The Community will contribute ECU16 million (about 
105 million [French] francs [Fr]), or half the estimated Fr210 
million cost of the instrument. 
  The Vegetation instrument will provide full global coverage 
at 1-km resolution, in the same HRVIR (visible and near 
infrared) spectral bands as SPOT 4's two primary cameras. "This 
instrument will be of great scientific interest and facilitate 
monitoring of natural ecosystems and continental agricultural 
systems," says CNES. The Community will use the instrument to 
support its policy in the domains of agriculture, environment, 
research, and international cooperation. The data will be 
intensively exploited by CCR's Institute for Remote Sensing 
Applications. 
  This accord adds both Vegetation and SPOT itself to the 
European Community's stock of operational "tools."

  [Text] Aerospatiale-Missiles' new facility for testing 
air-breathing engines is now up and running in Bourges. The 
facility was constructed as part of France's "PREPHA" hypersonic 
propulsion research program, and rounds out the three, already 
existing lines for testing ramjet missile applications. The 
facility will be used to validate the operation of large 
engines--up to flight Mach numbers of nearly 7--on the ground. 
The first tests of the PREPHA program scramjet will be conducted 
there in May 1994. The new test line can now compete with the 
best of those in the United States and Russia, and will be a 
driving force in future European efforts to work together on 
hypersonic propulsion.

<F P=106> [Article by Bernard Bombeau: "The ATR 82 Seeks Partners"; </F>
first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Franco-Italian consortium has settled on the 
broad outlines of its future 80-seater turboprop, which it may 
launch in late 1994 or early 1995, with or without new partners. 
  The initial timetable called for a launch decision in 
mid-1994. [But] the consortium's general director Henri-Paul 
Puel confirmed in late January that there would be a delay of at 
least six months for the project unveiled in June, 1991, in 
Bourget. Aerospatiale and Alenia will make no decision about the 
future of the ATR 82 program until the end of this year or early 
1995. The go-ahead, says Henri-Paul Puel, depends on three 
things: a technical design for the aircraft, a launch customer, 
and a healthy and realistic basis for financing the venture. 
  Technically, the design and engineering department has 
absorbed the lessons of two marketing campaigns. The ATR 82 
started out with 76 seats, a number that rose to 78, and 
recently to 80. "There is a real demand in that niche," confirms 
the program head. "Two thousand stage 2 `jets' with fewer than 
130 seats will have to be replaced toward the end of this 
decade. The majority of them operate over distances of less than 
500 km. The shorter the distance, the poorer the seat occupancy 
rate. These aircraft--which are costly to run--usually fly at 
only 50 percent capacity." 
  Hence the selection in Toulouse of an 80-seater "whose 
logical engine choice will be a turbo-powerplant." This does not 
mean, however, that the jet option (Allison AE3012, CF34-6, or 
ALF512) has been scrapped. The consortium has not abandoned the 
idea of manufacturing a common trunk that can accomodate either 
engine, "on a straight airfoil that we would have to alter and 
reinforce with new tail units." 
  But the first ATR 82, which the consortium says will be 
ready 
to fly in 1995-96, will be turbopropelled. "About 70 percent of 
our customers favor a turboengine," says the consortium's 
industrial director Antoine Bouvier. 
  Two turboprops were originally in competition: the former 
GMA 
2100 (AE2100) and the PW300/305. Both are derated engines in the 
4,500 hp category. "The Allison 2100 looks like a good 
candidate," says Henri-Paul Puel for now. But no final choice 
has been made. The consortium is paying particular attention to 
Lycoming's latest proposals involving the LP512 (derived from 
the LF507), and especially to General Electric's for the GLC38. 
Whatever the outcome, the engine selected will have to supply 
maximum takeoff power of 2,500 to 2,700 kW (3,600 hp), for a 
maximum weight calculated at 29,850 kg, a cruise speed of 335 kt 
(620 km/hr), and a maximum range. 
  Henri-Paul Puel currently estimates it will cost $500 
million 
to launch the ATR 82 program. "That is much too high, and will 
have to be pared down to an acceptable $400 million with the 
addition of new partners." The consortium CEO sees "the ATR 82 
as a chance to clinch new alliances while broadening our 
organization." From that standpoint, launching the ATR 82 would 
be a decisive step in creating a new, regional aircraft 
industrial entity, a development that Aerospatiale CEO Louis 
Gallois openly favors. 
  But with or without partners, the ATR 82 remains a priority 
objective whose accomplishment will depend on whether the 
consortium can be certain of finding "good launch airlines and 
at least 30 to 50 aircraft orders." 
  The ATR 82 is another ace the Franco-Italian consortium can 
play to move toward a rationalization of the commuter market.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "The Biggest Airbus Prepares </F>
for Its Maiden Flight"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Intended to replace the Super-Guppies, all four of 
which will reach retirement age before 2000, the AST is under 
final assembly in Toulouse. Its maiden flight has been announced 
for September 1994. 
  The aircraft's real name--the A300-600ST--leaves no doubt 
about its Airbus family connection. The Satic consortium has 
indeed developed the future replacement for the Super-Guppies 
from an A300-600R. But although the new airplane uses several 
unaltered subassemblies, says Satic President Ugo Drager, "the 
A300-600ST program is practically equivalent to the development 
of a new plane" due to the jumbo's size (over 56m long, over 17m 
high, and 45m in span) and technical complexity. All the same, 
the program enables Satic to borrow heavily from the know-how of 
its parent companies and partners, and to cut costs and 
development time while using top notch technologies. 
  The Satic consortium, a 50/50 joint venture of Aerospatiale 
Airplanes and Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, is the chief contractor 
in charge of coordinating the program. Not only is it 
responsible for negotiations with Airbus Industrie, which is 
acting as a real launch airline, it also handles the contracts 
signed with cooperating partners, even those assigned to members 
of the consortium as part of the program. 
  Commonly referred to as the AST (Airbus Super Transporter) 
or 
Belouga, after the great dolphin of the Northern Seas whose 
image it invariably conjures up, the aircraft is currently 
undergoing final assembly in the Toulouse halls of Hemet 
Exploration, a subsidiary of Sogerma-Socea. 
  Using an Airbus aircraft as a starting point enables Satic 
to 
cut costs by employing basic structural subassemblies 
manufactured by the production aircraft's traditional partners. 
In all other respects, however, the A300-600R's structure had to 
be substantially altered to boost its maximum carrying capacity 
to 45.5 metric tons (the Super Guppy can carry 23.8 metric t). 
Engineers had to increase fuselage diameter from 5.6m on the 
A300-600R to 7.4m on the AST, resulting in a modification of the 
entire upper part of the fuselage. Compartment access raised 
another problem, which was solved by lowering the cockpit below 
the level of the aircraft's floor, so that the cargo door could 
be positioned in the nose cone. This configuration makes it 
easier to open and close the door, which is the biggest ever 
installed on an aircraft. The door's position results in gains 
during loading and unloading of the craft: Turnaround time, said 
program officials during the aircraft's presentation in Toulouse 
on 3 February, drops from two or even three hours to 45 minutes 
at most, regardless of the weather. The cargo door can open 
effortlessly in 45 knot winds, which is not always the case with 
Super Guppies that are not sheltered in a specific type of hall. 
  But the aerodynamics of such a cargo plane are grossly 
different from that of the original craft. To compensate, 
engineers raised the tail fin and reinforced the rear horizontal 
stabilizer, equipping it with auxiliary fins to improve the 
aircraft's flight stability. 
  On 3 February, the AST was fitted with one of the key 
components of its modified portion, the cargo door. As the two 
diagrams show, work to alter the A300-600R's structure was 
assigned in batches to European partners. Approximately 80 
percent of production work on the AST has been farmed out to 
European subcontractors. The division of labor on the modified 
section breaks down as follows: 60.66 percent in France; 16.73 
percent in Germany; 13.03 percent in Spain; 8.71 percent in 
Great Britain; and 0.87 percent in the Netherlands. As one might 
expect, unaltered subassemblies will be produced in the usual 
factories of Airbus Industrie partners, to hold down costs.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Eyquem's Turbine Ignition Shows </F>
that French Ideas Are Exportable"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Eyquem has just sold its patent for thyristor 
ignition to Lucas, a move that may help it penetrate the very 
closed market of American enginemakers. Here are the details of 
its innovation. 
  The French may not have oil, but they have ideas. This 
fashionable 1970s slogan fits Eyquem to a tee. The 
company--better known among the general public for its 
automobile spark plugs--also has an aeronautics division, which 
supplies complete systems (ignition devices and spark plugs) to 
all of France's engine manufacturers. 
  As the first company to devise and patent a wholly 
electronic 
ignition system for turbines, Eyquem might have hoped that its 
technological breakthrough would earn it a toehold in the 
American engine manufacturer market. But that would be 
underestimating the conservatism (and sometimes implicit 
protectionism as well) of a profession that stands on its 
traditions. Especially as the massive arrival of new standards 
such as the ETOPS norms works in favor of already installed 
equipment. Indeed, ETOPS standards, which seek to authorize the 
operation from any alternate airport of passenger twinjets for 
120 to 180 flight minutes over the ocean, force manufacturers to 
prove the reliability of their engines and components. This is 
always easier to do on the basis of flight sheets than the 
promises of new technologies, even if the innovations have been 
designed to be more robust. 
  At the heart of Eyquem's patent is the notion of replacing 
traditional discharger tubes with one or more thyristors. Such a 
solution is likely to become the only possible one as discharger 
tubes gradually disappear from component catalogs for lack of 
applications. As a consequence, the French patent interests many 
people, starting with Lucas Aerospace, whose "Switchgear and 
Ignition" division decided to purchase a North American license 
from Eyquem a few weeks ago. The acquisition gives Eyquem's 
technology a real chance to penetrate Pratt &amp; Whitney-Canada 
and 
Allison engines, which Lucas supplies. 
  Strictly speaking, the French patent's claim does not 
concern 
the use of thyristors as a switch component, but rather a 
particular way of using them in ignition systems subjected to 
the harsh environment of engines. Engines commonly reach 
temperatures of 100ëC, making it impossible to cool 
thyristors using classic radiators. And in the first experiments 
conducted in Eyquem's laboratories in the mid-1980s, thyristors 
lasted no more than one or two hours. 
  After countless laboratory experiments and simulations, 
Eyquem engineers made the paradoxical discovery that it was not 
so much during the first few microseconds of the discharge (and 
thus the spark in the plug) that the thyristor suffered. Rather, 
damage was more apt to occur during the off phase, when the 
condensor that stores the energy needed for the spark charges 
itself. In fact, during the condensor's charge period, voltage 
at the thyristor's terminals gradually climbs to 2 or 3 kV, 
generating a roughly proportional leakage current. The whole 
process results in an escalation of heat in the component, which 
released early. 
  Since thyristors seemed well suited to very short discharges 
but not slow charges, Eyquem engineers came up with the idea of 
electronically controlling the condensor's charge cycle to keep 
it as short as possible. The solution has since been laboratory 
tested at 125ëC for 7,000 hours without any observable 
thyristor failure, and patented. The reliability edge has 
shifted to the thyristor camp, since, unlike discharger tubes, 
thyristors are not subject to electrode erosion and the 
accumulation of dirt. 
  In addition, doing away with discharger tubes makes it 
possible to consider cheaper industrial processes, such as 
automatic component insertion, wave welding, or surface assembly 
of components. Some of these methods have already been used to 
make the ignition cases for Turbomeca's Arriel 2 and Arrius 2 
engines. But the most interesting possibility raised has to do 
with the control flexibility thyristors can bring to ignition 
systems. The condensor's charge cycle can be modulated to create 
frequency flexibility, and timing the triggering of the 
thyristor can make for flexibility in energy levels and spark 
voltage. 
  Thyristors can thus be used to modulate the spark's energy 
and frequency, to conserve the spark plug's potential. Though 
spark plugs may seem fairly long-lasting now, this is because 
relatively few demands are being placed on them. That could 
change shortly, as the operational environments of spark plugs 
become harsher and harsher with the introduction of ever hotter 
and more compressed engines. In addition, for obvious safety 
reasons, users increasingly tend to keep ignition going during 
takeoff, landing, and even stable flight phases, to prevent the 
engine from dying. Thyristors could reconcile two 
criteria--safety and operating costs--that are often at odds. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: How a Turboengine Ignition System Works </H5>
  Unlike inductive-discharge-based automobile ignition, the 
so-called "high energy" ignition of turbines is produced by a 
condensor discharge. 
  In turbine sparking circuits, a string of impulses generated 
by a converter charges the condensor. The converter itself is 
supplied by the aircraft's 28 d.c. volt main supply. To reclose 
the discharge circuit that will trigger the spark in the plug, 
engineers have traditionally used a discharger tube. The tube is 
made of two electrodes inserted into an airtight glass bulb in a 
manner similar to lightning rods. When a certain charge voltage 
-- which depends on the shape of the discharger -- is exceeded, 
an electric arc forms between the two electrodes, and the 
discharger acts as a short circuit. Approximately one joule of 
energy is released in the spark plug at that instant, for a 
current of several thousand ampheres lasting 30-40 microseconds. 
In the Eyquem patent, one (or more thyristors in a row) 
replace(s) the discharger. To limit the joule effect in the 
thryistor, the condensor's charge impulses are modulated to 
reduce its charge time. The thyristor is maintained in a relaxed 
state for over 90 percent of its operating time. Its voltage 
rise can be calculated in milliseconds.

<F P=106> [An unattributed article: "Flight 63: Analysis and </F>
Corrective Measures"] 
  [Text] On February 18, 1994, at Evry, Charles Bigot, 
Arianespace chairman and CEO, Jean-Paul Herteman, chairman of 
the Flight 63 Inquiry Board, and Claude Quievre, Arianespace's 
Deputy Vice-President, Technical and Industrial Affairs, 
presented to the press the Inquiry Board's conclusions, the 
corrective measures plan and the outlook for launch resumption. 
<H5>  The Work of the Inquiry Board </H5>
  The Inquiry Board met from January 28 to February 14, 
working 
in four phases as explained by J.P. Herteman: "First, try to 
imagine all possible causes of the anomalies observed; compare 
these causes with all Flight 63 production, control and 
acceptance files as well as the flight's telemetry data; decide 
on their degree of probability, i.e., classify these causes into 
proven or established categories; finally, put forward 
recommendations based on this analysis." 
  The Board thus sent out, in particular, 113 inquiry or 
action 
requests to the manufacturers involved. 
  No nonconformity with quality requirements and processes was 
found in any of the production, assembly, control, testing and 
preparation operations on Flight 63's third-stage engine. 
  The work basically focused on analyzing the initial causes 
of 
an imbalance noted in the functioning of the immersed bearing of 
the HM7 engine's LOX turbopump between 8 seconds (at engine 
ignition) and 60 seconds after second-stage separation. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  The Inquiry Board did not establish a "unique and proven 
cause" for the Flight 63 failure. However, it concluded that 
the engine shutdown was probably due to the conjunction of a 
late precooling of the LOX pump bearing and a series of 
aggravating factors, probable or possible. 
  In fact, Flight 63 telemetry data indicate unusually slow 
precooling of the bearing itself, while the cooling at the turbo 
pump inlet was normal, even slightly early. This anomaly was 
never observed on previous flights. 
  As regards aggravating factors considered by the Inquiry 
Board, Jean-Paul Herteman mentioned a possible penetration of 
humidity during the opening of the oxygen drain valve on the 
ground and/or the trapping of purging gas inside the bearing 
cavity; certain pump components may have particular 
characteristics which could possibly lead to a higher level of 
energy or greater friction loads than usual. The Board also 
asked for further analysis of the Clevite seal (see photo on 
page 4), which was part of a new batch. 
<H5>  Recommendations </H5>
  The Inquiry Board put forward 15 recommendations, based on 
three complementary phases: first, to prevent the risks of late 
precooling of the LOX pump bearing cavity; second, reduce the 
risk of the appearance of aggravating factors which probably or 
possibly contributed to the failure; third, and more generally, 
reduce the bearing's sensitivity to functional disturbances. 
<H5>  Corrective Measures Plan </H5>
  Claude Quievre stressed the fact that the corrective 
measures 
plan adopted by Arianespace to implement the Board's 15 
recommendations will further improve Ariane 4's reliability, 
which remains at a high level after Flight 63. 
  This program aims at "improving the cooling circuit of the 
oxygen immersed bearing to make this function more independent 
of external conditions, and reinforcing the capacity of the 
bearing to stand the inevitable dispersions of functional 
parameters." 
  The measures adopted can be grouped in two categories: those 
concerning the thermal behavior of the oxygen pump, and those 
concerning its mechanical behavior. 
<H5>  Thermal Behavior </H5>
  A more thorough analysis of the precooling anomaly on Flight 
63 was undertaken to ensure that all possible causes were taken 
into account. The team involved has already been at work for 
the past few weeks and has contributed to drawing up the 
corrective measures plan. 
  To improve precooling of the bearing and ensure 
reproducibility, a purge line for the oxygen bearing cavity will 
be designed and qualified by SEP. This line will allow a 
controlled flow of the fluids during the purge of the oxygen 
circuit, during the precooling of the bearing and during engine 
operation. It should minimize overheating due to the highly 
leaktight Sealol and Clevite seals. 
  Improvement of the onboard and ground helium flushing of the 
purge line is also planned, to prevent any possible penetration 
of moisture in the circuit. 
<H5>  Mechanical Behavior </H5>
  To improve the robustness of the oxygen immersed bearing, it 
was decided, starting with Flight 64, to use a bearing whose 
ball races, and cage surfaces are fitted with a self-lubricating 
coating of molybdene disulfide, and that has increased cooling 
flow. This modification should make it possible to bear much 
higher axial loads. 
<H5>  Tests and Qualifications </H5>
  These two modifications will naturally be qualified with 
respect to Ariane specifications. The qualification program 
includes tests on the engine stand at Vernon and on the bearing 
test bench at Liege University (Belgium). 
  The tests will allow an experimental check of the 
self-lubricated oxygen bearing's resistance to extreme 
conditions of various functional parameters. The purge line 
will also be checked during engine tests. 
<H5>  Other Measures </H5>
  Recommendations aimed at improving models will naturally be 
respected. The thermal model of the bearing used by the Inquiry 
Board to establish its scenario will be completed. Along with 
limit tests, it should contribute to finally establishing the 
causes of Flight 63's late precooling. 
  Finally, as recommended by the Inquiry Board, redundant 
turbopump assembly checks will be carried out. 
<H5>  The Situation is "Well in Hand" </H5>
  Charles Bigot explained that this type of incident -- though 
extremely serious because of its consequences -- was not unusual 
at all in launcher operations. It will be handled as all 
incidents which arise during equipment production, checking and 
acceptance tests or pre-launch operations. 
  "We have the situation well in hand," he emphasized, thanks 
to "the perfect cohesion, total concertation, devotion and 
enthusiasm" of Ariane industrial teams, and thanks to the 
extensive data available to the company, "the result of 
considerable work and knowledge acquired, on the part of the 
industry, research organizations and laboratories." 
  For Charles Bigot, the two modifications are indeed 
"effective means to increase our system's reliability": the 
first because it provides a global solution to all possible 
causes of insufficient precooling, and the second, already well 
known, was already in the process of qualification. 
<H5>  Quality First </H5>
  However, Arianespace's corrective measures plan is quite 
complicated. Introducing beneficial modifications is not 
enough; it is also essential to ensure that any possible 
secondary effects are innocuous. Modifications will be 
qualified in accordance with the tradition of rigor and 
vigilance of the Ariane program, which "forces us to respect not 
only the well-established formal sequences, including critical 
review, qualification board, etc., but also a fundamental 
methodology." Arianespace will naturally continue to give top 
priority to quality and security: "We owe it to our customers 
and we will not compromise on this point," said Charles Bigot. 
<H5>  Technical Details </H5>
<H5>  Overheating </H5>
  Some cases of overheating of the LOX turbopump immersed 
bearing were observed prior to Flight 63. 
  There are three types of overheating: small, very short 
peaks 
of low amplitude (approximately 1 degree), frequently recorded; 
show non-dispersed drifts, changing at less than one-tenth of a 
degree per second, observed on seven flights from L07 to V62; 
rapid drifts, never seen in flight before V63; six cases, 
however, were recorded during ground tests or checks. 
  These observations led to a series of measures: a hardening 
of criteria and conditions for the acceptance of HM7 engines; 
the setting-up of test benches in universities to analyze 
bearing behavior with a fine tooth comb; development of digital 
simulation of bearing behavior; finally, the study of a 
modification to reduce sensitivity of the bearing to thermal 
imbalance. 
<H5>  Humidity </H5>
  Among possible aggravating factors, the Inquiry Board 
analyzed a possible penetration of moisture during the ground 
opening of the oxygen purge valve. This problem never occurred 
before. On Flight 63, a minute amount of humidity may have been 
deposited on the cooling circuit filters. This humidity may 
have, not obstructed the filters, but slightly modified the 
oxygen flow during the precooling phase. Circuits are purged by 
helium flushing and compression/expansion cycles. 
  Corrective measures decided after Flight 63 -- installing a 
purge line and improving the on-board and ground helium flushing 
-- will ensure improved purging of the circuits. 
<H5>  The Cost of Corrective Measures </H5>
  Major expenses will of course be borne by the launcher 
operator. The interruption of flights, equipment disassembly and 
transportation, new acceptance tests, engine re-assembly, launch 
campaign resumption, additional transportation, air 
transportation of the third-stage engine over several months, 
etc. -- all this will be very expensive. This is why 
Arianespace regularly sets aside provisions and reserves. 
  Naturally, responsibilities are also shared with the 
industry, and this is provided for by multiple contracts. 
<H5>  Towards Flight Resumption </H5>
  The time required by the corrective measures plan will be 
"well used." The Inquiry Board set the example by releasing a 
very comprehensive report only three weeks after Flight 63. As 
for the industrial teams, they have committed themselves to work 
without stinting on their time or effort. "We know that our 
customers suffer, and will suffer, from this necessary delay. I 
would like them to rest assured that our only goal is to provide 
them with a regular, reliable service." 
  The date of the next flight cannot be set now, as it 
obviously depends on the state of progress of the different 
phases of the program, some of which affect subsequent ones. 
  However, Arianespace decided to complete all corrective 
actions within a reasonable timeframe, currently estimated at 
three months. This would allow launch resumption towards the end 
of May. 
  From Flight 64 onwards, every possible effort will be made 
to 
catch up on the flight schedule, through a substantial increase 
in the launch rate. Arianespace is therefore re-adjusting 
operational procedures -- but not modifying them -- to "carry 
out in three weeks, with the same quality and the same rigor 
what we carried out in four weeks up to now." 
<H5>  The Launch Manifest </H5>
  Arianespace's basic rule is to give priority to customers 
whose satellites could not be placed into orbit. 
  This will therefore apply to two customers involved: 
Eutelsat and Aerospatiale on behalf of Turksat.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Space: European Union To </F>
Participate in SPOT-4 Satellite Programme"; as released by 
Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The European Union is to contribute ECU16 million 
towards development of one of the Spot-4 satellite instruments, 
"Vegetation," work for which is being carried out by the French 
Space Agency CNES. 
  Spot-4 is an earth-observation satellite, due to be launched 
into orbit towards the middle of 1997. 
  CNES announced on January 17 that an agreement had been 
signed with the European Commission, under which some ECU16 
million will be made available to the French agency for 
development of the programme, in which besides the Commission, 
the French, Belgian, Swedish and Italian Governments are to 
participate. The technical work will be carried out by the 
French giant Aerospatiale. 
  The EU will be financing 50 percent of the Vegetation 
project, which calls for development of the instrument and 
establishment of a centre for image processing. CNES has 
announced that the Commission had already made provision for 
"complementary financing." In tandem with another instrument, 
the HVIR (high resolution in visible and infra-red images), 
Vegetation is expected to provide daily coverage of the globe 
with the same spectral characteristics as other high-resolution 
satellite instruments, whose images can be analysed at local and 
regional level. 
  Vegetation is thus expected to provide the EU with vital 
data 
on agriculture, environment, international cooperation and 
research.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "111th Meeting of the ESA Council: </F>
A Decisive Step Forward for the European Space Endeavour"] 
  [Text] At its 111th meeting, concluded in Paris on 
Tuesday, 15 February 1994, the ESA Council adopted an "Act in 
Council" giving the definitive go-ahead for the MSTP (Manned 
Space Transportation Programme) and the Columbus Programme. 
  "These decisions give us, for the next two years, the means 
to lay the foundations of the European space programmes for the 
year 2000. While taking due account of economic realities and 
political developments in Europe and the world, they mark ESA's 
commitment to vigorous and coherent pursuit of its ambitions, 
both with regard to the environment, science and its 
applications and telecommunications, and in the area of launch 
systems and manned spaceflight," said Mr. Jean-Marie Luton, ESA 
director general. "Furthermore, in proposing general use of the 
ECU from 1997, ESA is playing its part in asserting Europe's 
identity." 
  Today's "Act in Council" lays the legal and financial basis 
for the MSTP (203 MAU [Million Accounting Units] -- at 1993 
economic conditions; exchange rates as at 1 January 1994. 1 AR 
= 1 ECU) and Columbus (267 MAU) for the years 1994 and 1995. It 
also confirms the establishment of a unified structure for 
managing those programmes, which should result in the creation 
of a combined programme under the heading "Space Activities 
Related to Manned Spaceflight" in March 1994. The combined 
programme will comprise a crew transportation vehicle (CTV), an 
automatic transfer vehicle (ATV) and a Columbus in-orbit 
element, all three to be launched by Ariane-5, as well as 
flights in cooperation with the Russians (EUROMIR) and Americans. 
  The ESA Delegations have thus confirmed their resolve to 
participate in the worldwide cooperative effort and in the 
negotiations with all the Partners (U.S., Russia, Japan and 
Canada) aimed at developing an international space station. 
  At the 111th meeting, Council also confirmed that: the 
Envisat and Polar Platform Earth observation programmes will 
similarly be combined under a unified management structure; and 
the definition phase of the data relay satellite programme (DRS) 
now has the necessary financial cover. 
  Finally, a number of legal texts and agreements were 
approved, including, in particular, the Declaration on FESTIP 
(Future European Space Transportation Investigation Programme).

  [Text] Alenia Spazio and Matra Marconi Space have signed a 
contract to build the second Silex [semiconductor laser 
intersatelite link experiment] terminal to be installed on board 
the geostationary satellite ARTEMIS [Advanced Relay and 
Technology Mission], whose launch is planned for 1996. ARTEMIS 
is the first ESA [European Space Agency] program in which the 
Italian company [Alenia Spazio] is project leader. It will be 
used to test new technologies for links between space vehicles 
and between space vehicles and earth in preparation for the 
activities of the future DRS [data relay satellite] system. This 
will include -- via the Silex system developed by the ESA, CNES 
[National Center for Space Studies], and MMS -- high-density (50 
Mbps [megabits per second]) digital transmission between 
satellites using optical frequencies, or by laser beams. One of 
the terminals will be installed on ARTEMIS and the other on the 
French remote-sensing satellite SPOT-4. The images photographed 
by the latter, and the signals transmitted by the Japanese 
satellite OICETS, will be retransmitted to earth by ARTEMIS. 
For ARTEMIS, Alenia Spazio had already ordered repeaters in the 
S (2 GHz [gigahertz]) and Ka (23 GHz) bands from Alcatel Espace 
whose suppliers are Italy's FIAR, Germany's ANT, Canada's 
Comdev, and its own Belgian and Spanish subsidiaries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "SEP: Structural Qualification </F>
Testing of the Solid Fuel Engine of the Ariane 5"] 
  [Text] A key phase was passed on 11 February 1994 in the 
development of the MPS (Solid Fuel Motor), the solid fuel power 
plant of the Ariane 5. CNES [National Center for Space Studies] 
has commissioned Europropulsion (a subsidiary of SEP [European 
Propulsion Company] France and BPD [Fiat group] Italy) with the 
project. Working out of the MPA University of Stuttgart, Man 
Technologie of Germany, in charge of developing the body of the 
engine, submitted the metal structure of the engine (the most 
powerful powder burning engine ever built in Europe) to 
structural qualification testing at limit internal and external 
loads up to rupture point. Preparation of the model and 
procedures had been handled by Man Technologie and Andritz 
(Austria) under prime contractorship of Division Propulsion of 
Haillan Powder and Composite Propulsion Division. The one-month 
test period illustrated the ability of the motor body to 
withstand, with the required margins, all stress generated on 
the ground and in flight by the MPS and Ariane 5 space rocket. 
Rupture occurred under a pressure of 92 bars (1.4 times normal 
engine operating pressure) in accordance with the anticipated 
scenario. 
  For the third fire-up test of the MPS now being prepared at 
Kourou, engine attachment to structure will be representative of 
flight configuration. The qualification testing of 11 February 
1994 constitutes the green light of Europropulsion to continue 
this preparation work. The Ariane 5 is a program of the 
European Space Agency which has commissioned CNES with technical 
and financial management.

  [text] Mistrust prevails between Europeans and Americans 
over the very large passenger aircraft project. Consequently, on 
Saturday 7 May, Claude Terrazzoni, Aerospatiale Aircraft 
Division's director, said that in the coming weeks Airbus 
Industrie will begin the second phase of studies on the project 
named A3XX, without interrupting the feasibility study it is 
engaged in jointly with Boeing. Three of the world's great 
manufacturers (Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas) work on this 
program: in no way will one be caught napping by the competition. 
  At the moment, the project is in the very preliminary 
feasibility study phase. According to Aerospatiale, the market, 
mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, could accommodate a 60-craft 
annual production by 2010 and support this pace to 2020. The 
French aircraft builder--according to Mr. Terrazzoni--is afraid 
that cooperation with Boeing could be just a "deceptive ploy." 
Two months ago, this cooperation has been received with some 
skepticism by the European manufacturer, which is worried about 
losing its full liberty of action. 
  Today, the French fear that the Americans will launch their 
own craft based on the 747-400. They feel that Boeing's recent 
announcement to build an extended-range 777 two-jet version, has 
confirmed their suspicions. According to Mr. Terrazzoni, this 
aircraft "would compete directly with the existing B747-400 
four-jet craft, which will force Boeing to modify the B747-400 
and begin studies on a new larger aircraft." The French have 
clearly decided not to let this market pegged at $220 million 
(1.25 billion French francs [Fr]) escape them. But, for the 
moment, only two companies (British Airways and Singapore 
Airlines) have shown interest for an aircraft larger than 500 
seats.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Airbus Working on A300 and A310 </F>
Adaptations for Military Transport"] 
  [Text] Paris--Three partners of the European Airbus 
consortium are working to adapt the A300 and A310 wide-body 
commercial aircraft for military transport and refueling; they 
thus hope to find an outlet for second-hand aircraft and a 
market for new replacement aircraft. 
  Shown last week at the Singapore Aeronautical Show, the MRTT 
(Multi-Role Tanker Transport) has a market estimated at 110 
units worldwide by the year 2010, according to Aerospatiale--one 
of the three project partners with Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and 
British Aerospace (BAe). The fourth consortium member, CASA 
[Spanish Aeronautical Engineering Company] does not participate 
in the study. 
  The project promoters hope that the airlines that will sell 
some of their old A300 or A310 to be retrofitted for military 
purposes will replace them with more recent aircraft, ranging 
from the A320 to the A340 and including the A330 twin-jet. 
  According to Mr. Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale president, 
the MRTT is said to be developed mostly for France and Canada, 
which need military transport aircraft. Singapore might 
participate in the program if the country is interested in the 
MRTT. "But we need a number of orders before we can launch it," 
Mr. Gallois added without mentioning any precise figure. 
  For the time being, this market segment is dominated by U.S. 
aircraft that are about 40 years old: the KC135 (derived from 
the Boeing 707) and the KC10 (derived from McDonnell Douglas's 
DC10). 
  The MRTT might be offered in several versions: in-flight 
refueling, military transport (up to 270 soldiers), cargo 
transport, and all-purpose versions. According to Aerospatiale, 
it might be available by the middle of the decade. 
  This program, however, should not interfere with the FLA 
(Future Large Aircraft), the military transport aircraft for 
which feasibility studies were started in November by the Airbus 
partners and several other groups: the Turkish Tusas, the 
Portuguese OGMA, the Belgian Flabel, and the Italian Alenia. "We 
do not think that there will be any interference, as the FLA 
will be tactical and the MRTT logistic," a project official at 
Aerospatiale indicated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France: Aerospatiale Reduces its </F>
Losses in 1993"] 
  [Text] Paris--The state-owned Aerospatiale [National 
Industrial Aerospace Company] group reduced its losses to 1.42 
billion French francs [Fr] in 1993 (group share), compared to a 
negative result of Fr2.38 billion in 1992, in a "very depressed" 
aviation market, according to an announcement by the French 
group on 16 March. 
  Operating losses were reduced from Fr1.218 billion in 1992 
to 
Fr258 million. Net indebtedness was reduced by Fr3.2 billion to 
a total of Fr13.3 billion before posting the capital allocation 
of Fr2 billion from the state. Turnover was down 3 percent in 
1993 to Fr50.8 billion (-4.5 percent in terms of a constant 
"perimeter" and at the same dollar rate). 
  The sharp increase in the value of aircraft deliveries is 
explained by the fact that "sales of the A340 got up to speed, a 
circumstance which," according to Aerospatiale, "partially 
offset the sharp decline in the case of helicopters, the halting 
of the Hades program, and suspension of the Hermes project." 
  The year 1994 "will probably not see significant cyclical 
improvement," says Aerospatiale. The group feels that it 
"maintained or even strengthened its market share in 1993" and 
that it did so despite "the very difficult situation of the 
airlines and the existence of overcapacity in their sector." The 
state-owned group also draws attention to "the intense 
competition in military markets, which are being subjected to 
budget restrictions."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aerospatiale-BAe-DASA Agreement on </F>
Supersonic Research"] 
  [Text] Paris -- On 7 April, Aerospatiale announced that 
aircraft manufacturers Aerospatiale (France), British Aerospace 
(BAe) and Deutsche Aerospace have signed an agreement protocol 
for a joint supersonic research program. 
  The purpose of the European Supersonic Research Program 
(ESRP), which will be financed equally by the three parties, is 
to define the basic design for a future supersonic aircraft that 
might succeed the Concorde. 
  For the time being there are no plans to develop an actual 
supersonic aircraft. The project aims simply to choose the 
minimum specifications which will then enable significant 
research to be done. 
  The main specifications are a range of 10,000 km, a capacity 
of 250 passengers and a top speed of Mach 2 (2,250 km per hour). 
  With this initiative, the three manufacturers hope to create 
a center of European research that can compete with the work 
being done in the United States and Japan, and in a few years 
bring European research to almost the same level as in these two 
countries. 
  Last year, just $15 million was spent on supersonic research 
in Europe, as opposed to $60 million in Japan, and $108 million 
in the United States. 
  With their joint effort, Aerospatiale, BAe, and DASA also 
place themselves in a better position to negotiate their future 
participation in the development of a second generation 
supersonic aircraft that will probably mobilize manufacturers on 
all three continents. The development of such an aircraft is 
estimated to be worth around $12-15 billion (with a potential 
market of around 500 to 1,000 aircraft). According to the three 
groups: "Just one type of supersonic aircraft will be 
developed," for reasons of commercial viability.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "France: CNES 1994 Budget of Over 11 </F>
Billion Francs"] 
  [Text] Paris--The CNES [National Center for Space Studies] 
budget for 1994 totals 11,039,554,000 French francs [Fr]. 
Officials at the French space agency consider it a "good budget" 
and one that underscores the fact that "as far as the political 
authorities are concerned, space remains a priority," according 
to a statement by CNES President Rene Pellat at the agency's 
annual press conference on 16 March. 
  With a civilian and military space budget accounting for 40 
percent of the amounts being invested in space by Europe, 
"France remains the European leader in that area" and must keep 
that role within the ESA [European Space Agency], Pellat added. 
The CNES is nevertheless going to place a ceiling of some Fr5 
billion on its participation in ESA programs pending a 
reformulation of European space policy, which "should be decided 
on in mid-1995 during the next ministerial conference." 
  "That ceiling is not the result of an anti-ESA stance," 
Jean-Daniel Levi, general director of the CNES, pointed out. 
"Our participation in that agency will remain as it is; it will 
always be a compromise between our national programs and those 
of the agency." Pellat emphasized that the agency "is essential 
to Europe, but it cannot carry out military programs, whereas we 
must do so." 
  Of the total Fr11.039 billion--program authorizations (Fr8.4 
billion), ordinary expenditures (Fr875 million), and own funds 
(Fr1.764 billion) combined--47.95 percent will be used for 
French participation in the various programs of the ESA, to 
which France, along with Germany, is the biggest contributor; 
5.65 percent will be used for bilateral cooperation with 
countries such as the United States and Russia; 19.44 percent 
will be used for the national program; 15.06 percent will 
provide operating support for the programs; and 11.9 percent 
will be used for general operations, Levi said.

  Despite abandonment of the Hermes spacecraft program in 
1992, 
Fr4.148 billion (an increase of 3.8 percent over 1993) are 
earmarked for "access to space"--that is, the development of 
Ariane rockets, ATV [Automated Transfer Vehicle] and CTV [Crew 
Transport Vehicle] capsules, and the Columbus module. 
  Scientific activities will receive Fr1.704 billion (+6.4 
percent), applications (telecommunications, observation, and so 
on) Fr1.087 billion (+7.9 percent); rockets derived from 
Ariane-5 (first flight scheduled for October 1995) Fr485 
million, and support for current programs and operations Fr772 
million (-4.2 percent). 
  The Ariane-4's "will be even better when launchings resume 
at 
the end of May or the beginning of June" following completion of 
the modification program scheduled following the failure of the 
63d Ariane on 24 January, according to Pellat. As for 
development of the Ariane-5, it is continuing normally following 
the three tests in 1993. The M-3 test on the P-230 propellant 
stage is scheduled for June--with the M-4 and M-5 tests to 
follow in September and November using a new batch of propellant.

  Also scheduled for June is a test with a reinforced 
structure 
for the Vulcain cryogenic engine and its tubing. In November 
there will be a test with a real structure and two propellant 
stage mockups. In April, and then in Germany in October, there 
will be tests on the upper stage of Ariane-5. For their part, 
qualification tests on the nose cones are continuing in the 
United States. They will be followed by tests on the mechanical 
mockup of the complete launcher at the Guiana Space Center in 
Kourou. 
  In cooperation with the ESA, the CNES has already begun 
evaluating a further development of the Ariane-5 for beyond the 
year 2000 that should make it possible to launch a double load 
of up to 7,400 kg, or 1,400 kg more than with Ariane-5. And in 
cooperation with Italy, it is studying the need for a small 
European propellant-fired launch vehicle capable of placing one 
metric ton in polar orbit at an altitude of 700 km. 
  The Americans and Russians are still the CNES' two big 
partners when it comes to bilateral cooperation. Financial 
difficulties at the Russian Space Agency (RKA) make it somewhat 
doubtful whether it will be possible to carry out the 
French-Russian Mars-94 mission at the end of the year, given the 
economic problems being experienced by the Russians. As for the 
three scheduled flights by French cosmonauts between now and 
2000, it will be necessary to renegotiate them with the RKA, 
since the last two were to have taken place on the future 
R-Alpha international orbital station. 
  It is expected that the cosmonaut for the Cassiopee flight 
in 
1996 will be named in mid-1994. The choice will be either Dr. 
Claudie Andre-Deshays or Jean-Pierre Haignere. Two other French 
astronauts will participate in space flights or undergo training 
with NASA: Jean-Francois Clervoy, representing the ESA, is 
scheduled to fly on board the Atlantis space shuttle next 
October, and Jean-Jacques Favier, the CNES alternate for the 
IML-2 mission scheduled for July, will fly on the Columbia.

  As far as applications at the national level are concerned, 
the CNES is continuing to participate in preparations for the 
next two satellites, Telecom-2C and Telecom-2D. The former is to 
be launched in 1995 and the latter in 1996. Added to that, if 
approval is forthcoming, will be work on the major civilian and 
military telecommunications satellite program outlined in Yves 
Sillard's report. 
  The CNES is also continuing to follow up on definition of 
the 
Spacebus-2000 and Eurostar-3000 platforms for geostationary 
satellites in the 21st century and on the spin-off from the 
satellite optical link program (SILEX). It has also begun 
studies aimed at a technical definition of the future 
positioning and data collection system that will replace Argos. 
  In the area of earth observation, Spot-4 (lifetime: five 
years) is scheduled to be placed in orbit in 1995. Spot-5 has 
not yet been ordered, nor has the decision been made to produce 
new second-generation military Helios satellites to replace 
Helios-1 and Helios-2, the first of which is scheduled for 
launching by Ariane at the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. 
  Added to those typically French programs are the programs 
being carried out through international cooperation in 
connection with the environment, studies of global climate, and 
ocean studies: ERS, Envisat-1, and Topex-Poseidon. 
  Parallel with that in the scientific area, the French space 
agency is carrying out numerous programs with the ESA, the 
Russians, and the Americans. In particular, the Pronaos 
submillimetric telescope is to be launched from a balloon in 
Arizona in September.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Green Light for New EUTELSAT </F>
Satellite"] 
  [Text] Paris--EUTELSAT [European Telecommunications 
Satellite Organization] has just been given the green light to 
conclude its negotiations with France's Matra Marconi Space 
group for construction of its third television satellite, which 
is to be placed at 13ë East, according to an announcement on 
30 March by the European Telecommunications Satellite 
Organization. 
  The communique points out, however, that if the final 
negotiations with Matra Marconi Space fail, negotiations may be 
resumed with the French state-owned Aerospatiale [National 
Industrial Aerospace Company], which was also a candidate. 
  The new satellite, initially named Hot Bird Plus, will be 
delivered 27 months after the contract is signed and will be 
launched in the summer of 1996. It will join EUTELSAT II F1 in 
orbit as well as the next Hot Bird, which is scheduled for 
launching this year. Its expected lifetime is 12 years, EUTELSAT 
adds. 
  Television programming services will be able to choose 
between two coverage zones, one in Europe from west to east--in 
which case the programs will be accessible with small 
antennas--and the other from Russia to the Canary Islands and 
the Gulf countries. This new satellite will operate on both the 
FSS (11.45-11.7 GHz) and the BSS (11.7-12.5 GHz) frequency band 
with linear polarization. Its position at 13ë East is 
favorable for direct television, cable, and community antenna 
reception. 
  Four EUTELSAT II and three EUTELSAT I satellites are 
currently active. They carry broadcasting channels for 
television, radio, telephony, and communications with businesses 
and moving vehicles. 
  The EUTELSAT organization was officially established in 1985 
and consists of the public and private telecommunications 
services of 42 countries.

<F P=106> [Article: "ESA Reorganizes Manned Flight and Launcher </F>
Programs"] 
  [Text] Paris--The ESA Council at its 112th meeting held 
22-23 March approved a reorganization of its manned flight and 
launcher programs that was ordered on 15 February. Since that 
time, details of the reorganization were worked out by the 
agency's director general, Mr. Jean-Marie Luton. 
  Mr. Jorg Feustel-Buechl will head the manned flight and 
microgravity programs, and in that capacity he will be 
responsible for all studies on ESA participation in the 
international R-Alpha station as well as negotiations with 
partners in the project, including the Americans, Russians, 
Canadians, Japanese, and the 14 ESA member countries. 
  Specifically, he will be responsible for the Columbus 
laboratory-module program which is to link up with Columbus, 
related systems (polar platform, etc.), and vehicles for 
transporting crew and cargo (Crew Transport Vehicle, or CTV, and 
Automatized Transport Vehicle, ATV), plus the precursor flights 
scheduled with the Russians between now and the year 2000. He 
will also oversee all technological aspects of the orbital 
rendezvous, the future European remote manipulator arm, and the 
EVA suits that ESA astronauts will wear, as well as operations 
of the European Astronaut Center at Cologne. 
  Mr. Fredrick Engstrom as launch director has been given 
oversight responsibility for the Ariane-5 heavy rocket program, 
technologies pertaining thereto, future spin-off launcher 
programs, and co-management (with the National Center for Space 
Studies) of all ESA utilization of the Guyana Space Center, a 
spokesman said.

  [Text] The German reflyable science satellite Astro-Spas is 
currently being fitted out for its next mission at the German 
Aerospace AG (Munich-based DASA) Satellite Systems Division. 
The German Space Agency, DARA, and DASA have presented the 
satellite's new instruments and tasks at a news conference in 
Munich: The science satellite, bearing the name Crista-Spas, is 
scheduled to begin its "inspection" of the upper earth 
atmosphere in October this year. 
  Crista-Spas has the job of studying the upper earth 
atmosphere (10 to 150 km). The photochemical, energetic, and 
dynamic processes that take place in the upper atmosphere are of 
great significance to life on earth. An understanding of these 
processes and the behavior of the atmosphere is central to an 
understanding of current environmental issues, such as the ozone 
problem and the much-feared climate problem. 
  The measurements will be performed with two instruments: 
Crista and Mahrsi. Crista (cryogenic infrared spectrometer and 
telescope for the atmosphere) is an infrared measuring device 
with unprecedented three-dimensional resolution: 2.5 km 
vertical and 500 by 600 km horizontal. 
  It was developed to study small-scale dynamic structures in 
the upper atmosphere that have hitherto eluded measurement by 
satellite. Small-scale structures in the several hundred to 
several thousand kilometer range have only been detected to date 
by rocket, balloon, or ground measurements. However, these only 
gave local "snapshots," with the result that very little is 
known of the frequency of small-scale structures in time and 
space. Crista will make the first-ever global measurement of 
these structures and attempt to determine their frequency. 
  The measurements performed by Crista will be complemented by 
Mahrsi (middle-atmosphere high-resolution spectrograph 
investigation), a device for measuring radicals in the 
atmosphere. Mahrsi's main task consists in the global definition 
of the vertical density profiles of the hydroxyl radical and 
nitrogen oxide with 2-kilometer resolution at an altitude of 40 
to 150 km. The experiment will also provide information as to 
the neutral density and temperature in the atmosphere. 
  Responsibility for the development of the experiments, the 
scientific preparations for the mission, and the analysis of the 
parameters recorded is shared by the Bergland University in 
Wuppertal (Crista) and the Naval Research Laboratory, 
Washington, D.C. (Mahrsi). 
  The third Astro-Spas mission is scheduled for the fall of 
1995 and will be a second flight by the Orfeus and Imaps 
telescopes, which are being modified and enhanced in the 
meantime in the light of experience acquired during their first 
flight. A fourth mission -- with the Crista/Mahrsi payload -- 
has been firmly booked for fall 1996.

  [Text] Frankfurt (DPA)--The navigational system PRARE 
(Precise Range and Rate Equipment), which makes it possible to 
measure the earth with centimeter accuracy, has been introduced 
at the Geo-Research Center (GFZ) in Potsdam. A German computer 
is working with PRARE together with a laser situated on board 
the Russian satellite Meteor 3. Among other things, it can make 
an exact determination of continental drift, of the "tides" of 
the earth as a solid body, and of earth's gravitational field. 
The data is evaluated at the GFZ and also yield the flight path 
of the satellite with an accuracy of within 10 to 20 centimeters. 
  It is reported that PRARE has several advantages in 
comparison to other laser systems: it operates in all weathers, 
by night as well as by day, with approximately equal accuracy. 
Data is stored in the satellite and transmitted to the GFZ field 
office in Oberpfaffenhofen on every pass. 
  This earth-measuring project is the result of close 
cooperation between the German and Russian partners. On the 
German side, participants include the GFZ, the German Agency for 
Air and Space Affairs (DARA) and Stuttgart University. The 
satellite was manufactured in Russia by the Research Institute 
for Electro-Mechanics in Istra (Moscow district), while the 
flight is monitored by mission control centers in Kaliningrad.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Goering: "Europe's Downfall"; Subhead: </F>
"European Aerospace with Back to Wall, Resources Reduced, U.S. 
and Russia Forming Alliance, Columbus Program Languishing"] 
  [Text] Space research is currently between a rock and a 
hard place. In recent years the dimensions and objectives of the 
ambitious Freedom Project, the space station planned jointly by 
the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan, have already undergone 
repeated moltings. The National Aeronautics and Space Agency 
[NASA] and aerospace firms fear additional cuts. To play it safe 
they have assigned a redesign team to look for alternatives in 
international cooperation as well. 
  The outlook is not much better in Russia even if one more 
prestige project for a long-term stay in space has now been 
launched. In October 1993 there was still not even any more 
money for a booster rocket to relieve the crew in the MIR 
station. Another two modules have been standing by for a long 
while now to be transported into space in order to be added to 
the space station. 
  Space research cannot even expect much support any longer 
from the public. Although the experts do not tire of pointing 
out to the ordinary consumer the practical advantages of their 
costly experiments -- intercontinental TV transmissions, 
telephone conversations and data transmissions via satellite or 
the daily weather maps from space -- global recession and 
political insecurity have caused readiness to finance manned 
space projects to dwindle. 
<H5>  International Space Station </H5>
  Bowing to necessity, the U.S. space organization NASA and 
the 
Russian space agency RKA have effected a rapprochement, 
nothwithstanding ill feelings. The result is a cooperative 
agreement that provides for joint construction of space station 
"Alpha," that will later include the U.S.'s current partner 
countries. 
  The Russians are contributing their more than 20 years of 
experience in the construction of space stations. Especially 
valuable are their medical know-how about long-term stays in 
space of up to one year, on-board life-support systems and 
docking technology. 
  According to preliminary deliberations the cooperation is 
supposed to proceed as follows: in the initial phase the 
Americans will intensively make shared use of the MIR station. 
Then beginning in 1996/97 a manned station is supposed to be 
developed from the core module of MIR-2 and the U.S.'s 
laboratory module. In the third phase this will be fashioned 
into an international station and include Canada, Japan and the 
European Space Agency [ESA] also. 
  But there are reservations. Although the concept may be 
politically and financially convincing, the Europeans, above 
all, fear that they will be sidelined by the warm embrace of the 
two space giants. 
  Currently under Germany's overall leadership within the 
ESA's 
Columbus program a module has been developed that is supposed to 
be coupled to the space station as a work and living area for 
the astronauts. This "Attached Pressurized Module" [APM] 
reportedly has a length of 12.8 meters, a four-meter diameter 
and weighs as much as 28 tons. 
  What the U.S. and Russia are now jointly contriving renders 
that project obsolete. A higher orbital inclination vis-a-vis 
the equator at 51.6ë is to be selected for the international 
station. That suits the Russians, since their present space 
stations already occupy that orbit from the Tyuratam launch site 
in Kazakhstan. Freedom, on the other hand, is to have a 28.5 
degree orbital inclination. This consequently facilitates the 
maximum space shuttle payload from the launch site at Cape 
Canaveral. 
  After launching there can hardly be justification for any 
alteration of the specific orbital inclination for the Russians. 
It would require additional energy and the effective weight of 
the U.S. booster systems would be reduced. 
  The new variations have heavily impacted the ESA and Japan. 
Their modules have been designed for the shuttle's maximum 
payload. The reduction that is now required will result in 
higher costs for Europe and narrow their scientific programs. 
The Europeans cannot even prevail by arguing that the crew 
reduction takes away necessary working space. The Russians, on 
the other hand, maintain that with the MIR-2 core module and 
possible additional modules there will be sufficient room 
available at least for the first year of operation. 
  Under budgetary pressure in Germany, Jan-Baldem Mennicken, 
the general director of the German Space Agency [DARA], has 
asserted that development of the Columbus module should no 
longer be pursued. It would make better sense to introduce key 
systems as early as the second phase of the construction 
beginning in 1997. "There are good prospects here for the data 
management system developed for the Columbus and that the 
Russians want to incorporate into MIR-2." 
  As always, thousands of well paying jobs in Germany are at 
risk. At stake is valuable know-how that has been accumulated 
over many years and that later will possibly have to be 
repurchased at high cost from abroad. 
  Europe and Japan have to swallow yet another bitter pill. 
The 
launch deadines are being moved from 1998/99 to the year 2002, 
or even later. Each year of delay results in additional costs of 
several dozen millions. 
  The free-flying laboratory originally planned by the ESA in 
the Columbus program, that was to be transported into orbit with 
the Ariane 5 and serviced by the Hermes space transporter, has 
now been virtually brushed aside. Since the decision was made 
not to build the Hermes there is just no way of determining how 
it can be introduced in other projects. 
  The question is wide open as to what alternatives for 
cooperation are left for Europe with the super-union of the U.S. 
and Russia. It is hardly possible any longer to speak of a 
partnership. The ESA is still seeking to paper over the breach: 
there is agreement on the fact "that a process of ongoing 
consultations has to be implemented on all levels that could 
lead to Russia becoming an equal partner in the international 
space station," is the way it is diplomatically worded from 
Paris. 
  The ESA has been forced to tackle the issue head on. But its 
proposal to contribute a manned transport capsule and a 
freighter has hardly met with a warm reception. Yuri Semyonov, 
general director of NPO [Scientific Production Association] 
Energiya, snidely retorted: "Why reinvent the bicycle? Both 
systems are already available in Soyuz and Progress."

<F P=106> [Article by LUK: "Small Leap, Great Hope"] </F>
  [Text] The 12.6-meter tall model rocket took off, climbed 
up to 90 meters, shifted sideways 105 meters, and 66 seconds 
later made a soft landing in an upright position. The 
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, was enthusiastic: the principle 
of a single-stage, fully reusable booster system had proven its 
practicability. The first flight into the stratosphere of the 
Delta Clipper-Experimental [DC-X] is supposed to follow with two 
years. If all goes well, commercially usable rockets measuring 
39 meters in height and having an 11.5-ton payload could then be 
developed. 
  The idea of a "single-stage-to-orbit vehicle" [SSTO] reaches 
back to the sixties. Douglas Aircraft's Phil Bono wanted to 
build a rocket that could dispatch U.S. troops to crisis areas 
around the world in an hour. At the time there were no prospects 
for the project. NASA had its hands full with the space shuttle. 
  Only after it became fully evident that over the long run 
the 
principle of lavish space travel was too costly did people in 
the U.S. space sector recall the SSTO that had been shelved. Max 
Hunter, one of McDonnell Douglas' leading design engineers in 
Huntington Beach (California), also saw in it an opportunity to 
recoup at least something from the loss of contracts concomitant 
upon the cessation of the Space Defense Initiative [SDI] 
program. Other lobbyists kept pressuring until then U.S. 
vice-president Dan Quayle diverted $80 million from the SDI 
program to McDonnell Douglas' SSTO project in 1991. 
  In the words of project director William Gaubitz: "The aim 
in 
developing the Delta Clipper is a space-travel system that can 
fly both with and without a human crew, does not eject any part 
in flight, lands upright and is fully reusable." Average cost of 
a "Space Shuttle Light" launch will supposedly cost $10 million. 
NASA currently projects $409 million for each launch of a space 
shot. 
  It takes only 18 months to build the DC-X. In the period 
following the first trial flight in August 1993 at the U.S. 
White Sands test site in New Mexico additional launches 
entailing flights as high as several hundred meters have been 
carried out. 
  German engineers have likewise contributed to the current 
success. The landing system with each of its 160 kilogram [kg] 
light-weight telescoping legs and landing feet was developed and 
built in the record time of nine months at Deutsche Aerospace AG 
[DASA] in Munich. It also entailed the largest subcontract that 
U.S. aerospace firms have awarded so far outside the U.S. for 
the Ottobrunner design engineering firm.

  [Text] Paris--The National Center for Space Studies (CNES) 
and the Israeli Space Agency (ISA) signed a three-year, tacitly 
renewable collaboration agreement on 11 April in Tel-Aviv. The 
accord was signed by the general director of the French space 
agency, Jean-Daniel Levi, and his ISA counterpart Marcel Klajn. 
It had been discussed during the visit of French foreign affairs 
minister, Alain Juppe, to Israel in February. 
  Israel and France have already collaborated in the past, 
since the Amos satellite was built by Israeli Aeronautics 
Industries, Alcatel (France), and Dornier (Germany). It is 
slated to be launched next year by an Ariane rocket. 
  The two agencies will work together "to use space for 
peaceful ends and for economic and scientific development," in 
accordance with the terms of this "arrangement defining a 
framework for collaboration in space." 
  The accord should also stimulate joint space projects 
between 
the two countries and their industries. It will cover space 
research in the fields of astronomy, solar system exploration, 
Earth sciences, biology, space medicine, and microgravity 
physics. 
  It will also involve applications in Earth and environmental 
observation, weather forecasting, systems for collecting and 
localizing environmental data, communications, and the 
positioning of satellites. The two agencies will work together 
on space techniques relative to robotics, small satellites, 
space technology, and quality-reliability problems. A mixed 
committee bolstered by expert working groups will coordinate 
their work.

  [Text] The Federal Research Ministry is granting a total 
of 150 million German marks [DM] in subsidies towards the 
construction of the "Sciamachy" (Scanning Imaging Absorption 
Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography) remote sensing 
instrument, DM50 million of which will be to process the data 
for use. At the same time, the Netherlands are providing about 
75 million guilders [hfl]. 
  A cooperation agreement to this effect was signed yesterday 
by the German Space Agency (DARA) Managing Director Jan Baldem 
Mennicken and the Dutch Aircraft Development and Aerospace 
Institute (NIVR) Chairman von Ardenne. The bilateral project 
will be a major step in the joint efforts to make greater use of 
aerospace technology in international cooperation for 
environmental research, State Secretary of Federal Research and 
Technology Ministry Gebhard Ziller stated. 
  It also increased the joint commitment of both nations to 
satellite-based Earth observation. German-Dutch cooperation in 
developing Sciamachy was an outstanding example of European 
cooperation on a space program, Ziller said. 
  Sciamachy will measure traces of gases, of great importance 
particularly for ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect in 
the atmosphere. Developed by German and Dutch scientists and 
firms since 1989, the Sciamachy absorption spectrometer will be 
used in the European Space Agency (ESA)'s "ENVISAT-1" mission 
planned for 1998. The ENVISAT-1 environmental satellite's 
complex payload is designed to observe the atmosphere, the 
oceans, land surface, and the polar ice caps. 
  ENVISAT is being developed by a European consortium headed 
by 
a German firm. The ENVISAT mission is part of the international 
"Mission to Planet Earth" initiative and will give Europe a 
fresh opportunity to consolidate its technological lead in Earth 
exploration, DARA reports. Two instruments developed in Germany 
for observing the Earth's atmosphere have already been installed 
on it.

  [Text] German researchers are presently arranging a 
Russian-German-Japanese Space cooperation project. They are 
outfitting a Russian reentry vehicle with German infrastructure 
for the "Express" experiment. 
  There will be German and Japanese experiments on board the 
capsule, which will be launched on 9 September by a Japanese 
M2-S3 booster. 
  The Munich Kayser-Threde GmbH is responsible for the central 
power system for the equipment, the boosting and processing of 
the measurement signals, and data processing. 
  The three experiments will concentrate on the continued 
development of technologies for reentry into the Earth's 
atmosphere. The scientific work will begin at the conclusion of 
the flight, when the nose cone of the capsule heats up to 
2,400ëC in the atmosphere. The capsule will be brought to 
Japan in July to prepare for launch.

<F P=106> [Article by Rene Raaijmakers: "Advance of Communication </F>
Lasers in Space Industry. No Need for Radio Frequencies in 
Future Satellites"] 
  [Text] Noordwijk--In 1997, for the first time in history, 
two satellites will transmit using light. It will only be a 
test, but data transfer using infrared lasers instead of radio 
waves ultimately promises great advantages. 
  In an artist's impression or on a photograph of a hovering 
man-made moon, two significant components are instantly 
noticeable: the solar panels and the dish antenna. Such a view 
could drastically change if satellites start using optics for 
communication. The dish would disappear altogether and the 
solar panels would become smaller. Volume and weight savings 
are within reach, and those are powerful criteria in competitive 
space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA) will 
therefore start experimenting with lasers and optical receivers 
within the next three years. 
<H5>  Optical Data Transfer </H5>
  ESA is taking the first step with the launching of the 
French 
earth observation satellite, Spot-4, at the end of 1996. 
Shortly after that, at the beginning of 1997, Artemis will be 
launched into space. Artemis is an advanced geostationary 
satellite by which various new telecommunications systems will 
be tested. These two will be the first to make use of optical 
data transfer. In addition to the usual dish antennas, with a 
diameter of almost three meters, each satellite will be 
specially equipped with a telescope 25 centimeters in diameter. 
  An optical receiver with this diameter would at the moment 
be 
no lighter than the dish antennas. But when lasers with a 
higher capacity are used in the future, the mass of the optical 
modules could well decrease. "There are as yet no advantages 
with these first attempts. But by the second or third 
generation we make a profit," said Gotthard Oppenhauser, payload 
manager Data Relay Technology Mission (DRTM) at ESTEC in 
Noordwijk. Spot-4 will send remote sensing data back to the 
earth via Artemis. The Spot observation satellite orbits at a 
high speed only 700 to 800 kilometers above the earth's surface 
and can as a result remain in contact with an individual ground 
station for no longer than 10 minutes. The Silex optical 
modules on board Artemis and Spot-4 will, however, enable a 
direct connection between the observation satellite and the 
control room in Toulouse (France). Contact is possible as long 
as Spot-4 is within view of Artemis, which will hover 36,000 
kilometers above the earth. Every 50 minutes, Spot will 
disappear behind the earth's sphere and will in practice be in 
direct contact with Artemis for only about half of its orbit. 
<H5>  Greatest Challenge </H5>
  This also means that the satellites will continually have to 
search for each other. They will send out strong signals with 
19 high capacity lasers, each of 500 milliwatt. This 
"searchlight" cannot be relied upon for communication, but only 
for identification. For the actual transmission, a 
100-milliwatt semiconductor laser will be installed. Both kinds 
are (aluminum gallium arsenide) semiconductor lasers with a wave 
length of about 800 nanometers. This wave length was chosen 
because it is suitable for the most sensitive receivers. There 
will be two reserve 100-milliwatt lasers on board. 
  The greatest challenge in the ESA project is the development 
of a very accurate tracking system. For communication purposes, 
a continuous connection is necessary between the stationary 
Artemis and the Spot-4, which will be moving at a speed of 
30,000 kilometers an hour. The Silex modules on board Artemis 
and Spot-4 must be able to track each other at an accuracy level 
of 0.50 millidegrees. This means that at a distance of 36,000 
kilometers, a deviation of a maximum of 100 meters would be 
allowed. Sensors and electronics must constantly read, 
calculate, and correct the deviation. The laser signals from 
Artemis will also be received at an optical ground station on 
Tenerife. At an altitude of 2,500 meters, and thus almost free 
of diffused light, a telescope one meter across will be erected 
during the second half of 1995. The optical antenna has already 
been made by Carl Zeiss Jena, with support from the German space 
institute DARA, and was completed in November 1993. At the 
moment it is undergoing extensive testing. 
<H5>  A Promising Future </H5>
  The Silex terminals of which the lasers will form a part 
were 
developed by ESA in collaboration with the French space 
laboratory CNES [National Center for Space Studies]. The 
transmission speed is 50 megabits per second. With these 
optical modules, communication is also possible in principle 
over a distance of 40,000 kilometers at a speed of 100 megabits 
per second, but the electronics on the Spot-4 are still a 
limiting factor. Radio waves for satellite communications (with 
a wave length of 15 and one centimeters) generally also reach a 
transmission speed of 100 megabits per second. 
  In principle, however, lasers can be modulated with a much 
higher data speed. For satellite applications, however, a 
higher capacity is also necessary. "We are doing it with a 
simple but robust method," said Oppenhauser. "We are merely 
switching the lasers on and off 50 million times a second." 
  In the future the question to consider will be: greater data 
speed with more capacity, or a smaller telescope. In any case, 
Oppenhauser expects a ten-fold improvement in the sensitivity of 
the optical detection by use of more sensitive modulation 
methods very soon. 
  Not much energy is required for the laser transmission. The 
present lasers work at 100 milliwatt, while satellites for radio 
transmission need to be able to produce 30 Watt very quickly. 
It will therefore be possible to have smaller solar panels in 
the future. 
  A consortium of some 20 companies under the leadership of 
Matra Marconi Space will handle the production of the Silex 
terminals. The first commercial optical modules will be 
installed on the DRS1 and DRS2 (data relay satellites) which 
will probably be launched in 1998 and 2003 respectively.

<F P=106> [Article by Josee Piepe: "Why The World Needs `Sciamachy'"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Up to now, our knowledge of the 
composition and chemistry of the atmosphere has remained very 
incomplete. That is the reason why, in 1989, a start was made 
on the so-called Sciamachy project. Sciamachy stands for 
"Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric 
Cartography." The project includes the development and 
construction of an instrument which can measure very precisely 
the ozone and other trace gases in the atmosphere. If 
everything goes according to plan, the Sciamachy instrument will 
be placed on ESA's (European Space Agency) ENVISAT-1 satellite. 
The satellite, equipped with Sciamachy, must be launched in 
1998. 
<H5>  Satellites </H5>
  Satellites play an essential role in research into the 
atmosphere. Measurements carried out in space are very 
attractive because they make it possible to study the atmosphere 
at random places above the surface of the earth. Moreover, 
space platforms provide the possibility to carry out 
simultaneous measurements with instruments that complement each 
other. Results obtained via these measurements can then be 
compared more easily with each other, and the findings are more 
reliable. Because even the smallest trace particles influence 
the atmosphere, researchers need to demand high standards for 
the measuring sensitivity of their instruments. 
<H5>  Advantages </H5>
  The problem, for instance, with measuring the local ozone 
layer is that local concentrations of ozone not only undergo 
many daily changes but also seasonal changes. The concentration 
also varies according to the latitude. The determination of 
annual trends therefore requires both long-term and accurate 
measurement, which is where the great advantages of using 
Sciamachy come into play. Sciamachy can perform continuous 
measurements for many years. In addition, a particular point is 
that this instrument can carry out measurements of unprecedented 
exactitude. Sciamachy will be able to measure the precise 
composition of the atmosphere to a very high degree of accuracy, 
both vertically (looking down perpendicularly) and horizontally 
(looking along the atmosphere). Expectations are high: 
observations carried out with Sciamachy will play a very 
important role in the understanding of the chemical composition 
of the atmosphere and of its eventual changes. 
<H5>  Together </H5>
  Observation of the earth is very costly. The Sciamachy 
project is a joint project between the Netherlands and Germany 
and costs some 170 million Dutch guilders [G]. The Netherlands' 
share of this is G75 million. In constructing this instrument, 
Germany and the Netherlands are in fact contributing in kind to 
the ESA [European Space Agency] earth observation program. The 
Ministry of Education and Science is paying G34 million, that of 
Economic Affairs G22 million, while the Ministry of Housing, 
Planning and Environment is paying G19 million. It is the first 
time that the last-mentioned ministry has been involved in a 
large earth observation project, because environmental and 
climate research will both benefit from Sciamachy. Netherlands 
management for the project rests with the Netherlands Institute 
for Aircraft Development and Space Travel (NIVR), while their 
German counterpart is DARA (the German Agency for Space 
Exploration Matters). At the end of March 1994 the two 
countries will sign a memorandum of understanding, to emphasize 
once again their positive collaboration on the project.

<F P=106> [Article: "Rapeseed Oil Test in Freiburg Successful"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt--In Freiburg a field test with 29 taxi 
drivers, who for two years operated their diesel taxis 
exclusively with rapeseed oil and drove a total of about 2.5 
million kilometers, has been successfully concluded. Model 190 D 
and E Mercedes-Benz vehicles were used and about 240,000 liters 
of non-estered rapeseed oil (RME). 
  As reported by Mercedes-Benz AG, just a few technical 
problems occurred during the test. The test results are so 
promising that the test series will continue with two modified 
C-200 diesel taxis this year in Stuttgart. 
  The RME fuel was supplied by Novamont (Montedison-Ferruzi 
Group). It is comparable to diesel, but is nontoxic and 
biologically degradable. When it is growing rapeseed absorbs 
about as much carbon dioxide as is released when burning it. 
According to information by the Federal Environment Office, the 
absolute carbon dioxide emission is about 35 percent below that 
of a diesel-operated passenger car. 
  The Freiburg taxis equipped with exhaust gas recirculation 
and oxidation catalysts only needed a small amount of technical 
alteration, it is further said. This applied to the replacement 
of elastomer hoses and seals in the fuel supply with parts made 
of special rubber. Dealing with the fuel itself, however, 
required a great deal of attention. Rapeseed oil turned out to 
have a tendency to become contaminated, which occasionally led 
to clogged injection nozzles. 
  But such fuels are unsuitable for widespread use. In order 
for all diesel cars in the old laender to be able to drive on 
RME, 56 percent of the German agricultural area would have to be 
planted in oil plants. However, it is worth considering 
application in consumer niches, argues Mercedes-Benz.

  [Text] Ulm--On 13 April the German automaker Daimler-Benz 
experimented with a hydrogen-fueled car at its Ulm research 
center. According to the group's CEO, Edzard Reuter, the vehicle 
marks "a first step toward `ecological mobility,'" 
  The vehicle's electric engine is not fueled by batteries, 
but 
by its own small electrical plant that runs on hydrogen. The 
hydrogen converts solely into water vapor, which is expelled 
into the air. Reuter considers the advance significant not only 
for the automobile industry, but for energy supply in general. 
Daimler could play an important role in the market for new 
energies in the future through its knowledge of the new 
technique. 
  But Hartmut Weule of Daimler's research department stressed 
that it will take engineers and researchers years of continued 
testing before the revolutionary model can be mass-manufactured. 
Daimler group has already invested over 100 million German marks 
in hydrogen vehicle research.

<F P=106> [Article by Rolf Helmueller: "Electric Drives for Local </F>
Public Transportation Vehicles--Automatic Single Push-Button 
Battery Exchange--Automated Charging Stations to Allow Scheduled 
Service by Battery-Driven Busses"] 
  [Text] Automated battery exchange stations make it 
possible to use battery-operated busses for scheduled service. 
Electric busses can be used for scheduled service only if these 
exchange station are designed so that they require no physical 
strength and a bus driver can use them without difficulty. Bob 
Lee, technical director of "Neoplan" Gottlob Auwaerter GmbH, 
Stuttgart, is convinced that this is possible. At the 
conference, "Electric Drives for Local Public Transportation 
Vehicles" in Aachen on 24 March, he stated that this system 
provides the technology for 24-hour service. 
  He also stated that the mobility of the battery-charging 
stations which "Neoplan" developed together with battery 
manufacturer Varta is the key for scheduled bus service using 
electric busses. The charging station can be placed at any 
location and require only a few square meters of space. Due to 
their container format they can be relocated by any truck 
suitable for container transport, Bob Lee explained at the VDE 
conference in Aachen. This makes it possible to use this lead 
traction battery with armor-plate technology and electrolytic 
conversion wherever it is needed. According to the vehicle 
manufacturer's managing director even a change in the bus route 
layout would not be a problem. The limited range of scheduled 
busses,, as well as the recharging time of 5 to 6 hours, would 
not be a factor with the new mobile system. 
  A typical scheduled service cycle, for instance, covers 
approximately 140 km per 10-hour day. According to Bob Lee, no 
currently available standard battery is able to provide the 
necessary power without a recharging time of several hours. Even 
quick and partial charging methods require downtimes which are 
not acceptable for scheduled bus service. 
  With the battery exchange system presented the bus will 
drive 
approximately 40 km--approximately seven trips on a 5-km long 
route--and then stop at an exchange station positioned along the 
route. Two roller band arms from the station will be attached to 
the bus. When the driver pushes a button, the empty battery is 
taken up by the roller bands and moved from the bus to an empty 
charging bay in the exchange station. When another button is 
pushed a charged battery is transported into the bus. "This does 
not take longer than a stop at a gas station", states Dr. Rainer 
Bittihn, head of systems development in the Varta industrial 
batteries division, Kelkheim. He explained that this is the 
reason why the complete system consisting of bus battery and 
exchange system has met with broad acceptance among operators 
and bus drivers during many actual demonstrations. 
  In its standard version the battery exchange container with 
a 
footprint of 2.5 x 6.0 m can accept up to four batteries which 
will be charged simultaneously. Two two-level shelves and a 
lifting table on a loading area are provided. A separate room 
houses a corresponding number of chargers and the water supply 
for the "Varta-Aquamatiksystem." As an example, five batteries 
are required to ensure uninterrupted service of two busses from 
6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 
  According to Rainer Bittihn this concept can also be used 
for 
the local distribution of goods. Smaller, battery-driven trucks 
would accept the goods from heavy trucks or trains at centers 
close to downtown and distribute them throughout the city. The 
centers could also be used as exchange stations. According to 
battery expert Bittihn, the prerequisites for such a system are 
already present; to put it into practice requires "nothing but 
the commitment and decision by politicians".

<F P=106> [Article by Martina Lanzrath: "Batteries Are the Achilles </F>
Heel of Electric Cars" 
  [Text] In the seclusion of the Baltic island of Ruegen, the 
softly humming electric car prototypes are making their first 
test runs. Yet the vagaries of battery technology, above 
everything else, delayed the still uncertain steps of the newly 
constructed E-car and dragged the bearer of hopes for doing away 
with exhaust fumes through the turmoil of [newspaper] headlines. 
The familiar words "Ruegen [(or "reprimands" in English)] on 
Ruegen" made the rounds, and a cool breeze of skepticism hit the 
[producers and drivers of non-polluting cars]. A little annoyed 
and looking suitably injured, the Ministry of Research and 
Technology along with representatives from the automobile 
industry, battery producers and electric companies are now doing 
an interim evaluation of the field tests on Germany's largest 
island. Difficulties with the high-performance batteries and 
their integration into the current concept of the [electric car] 
were in fact, as Research Minister Paul Krueger conceded, more 
serious than was at first suspected. In the meantime, however, 
the 36 electric cars carried out their humming work quite 
reliably and all together already have around 185,000 km of 
local exhaust-free [driving] behind them. The electric fleet is 
supposed to be increased to 60 vehicles by August, all outfitted 
with automatic measurement units which until 1996 will provide a 
unique data bank. 
  The Ruegen cars get energy from four different storage 
media. 
In addition to the older lead-gel battery, the sodium-sulphur, 
the nickel-cadmium and the sodium-nickel chloride batteries are 
also being put to the test of everyday use. Since freedom of 
travel is still limited for the electric cars, one pilot fuel 
station in Zirkow is currently testing a quick-charge technique. 
This would make it possible to "tank up" the batteries in less 
than a hour. Minister Krueger and the industry are promising 
[travel] distances of a full 400 km only from the third 
generation of propulsion batteries based on lithium, whose 
development is still in its infancy. The Research Minister 
remains decisively loyal to the local emission-free clean 
driver, even for the future. In addition to the major test being 
supported on Ruegen with 22 million German marks, 60 million 
more will be made available for the development of fuel cells. 
This technique electrochemically transforms combustible liquids 
or gases directly into electricity--and practically without 
producing any pollution. Even with the market introduction of 
economical, mass produced vehicles, the federal government will 
stand beside the car makers. An inter-ministerial working group 
made up of representatives from the ministries of 
Transportation, the Environment, Financial Affairs and Research 
as well as the office of the Chancellor have since the end of 
March been preparing appropriate guidelines. 
  For Volkswagen Director Ulrich Seiffert, exemption from the 
automotive tax, harmonizing the competitive conditions and tax 
advantages are basic requirements for giving the electric cars 
any chance at all on the automobile market. At the same time, 
the German industry's technical lead may not be thoughtlessly 
gambled away to thus leave the way open for the Japanese 
producers. "There is a danger that we are becoming a country 
hostile to innovation." With these words the industry 
representatives demonstrated--with a side glance at the Ruegen 
critics--the auto makers' new sensitivity to things concerning 
the electric car.

  [Text] Daimler-Benz is looking for an alternative form of 
energy for the automobile. At its research center in Ulm, the 
company yesterday presented a vehicle with an electric motor 
which gets its energy from a fuel cell. 
  Speaking at the company's research center in Ulm, the 
Chairman, Edzard Reuter, stated that Daimler-Benz AG was well in 
front of the international field with the car driven by a fuel 
cell instead of a petrol or diesel engine. The prototype 
vehicle has already done 2,000 km without any problems. The 
task now is to reduce the size and weight of the fuel cell by 
using new materials and technology, and to develop the system at 
a marketable price. Research Chief, Prof. Hartmut Weule, is 
confident that this can be done within a period of 20 to 30 
years. 
  In addition, Daimler-Benz is continuing the development of 
electric vehicles with the Zebra battery, a high-performance 
battery with sodium and nickel chloride. This is one of several 
possible solutions developed by the Daimler subsidiary AEG. 
  Daimler-Benz runs the fuel cell with methanol from which the 
hydrogen is obtained in the vehicle. Methanol is produced from 
natural gas and is a widely available chemical substance. A 
vehicle could fill up in the normal way from a pump at service 
stations. The vehicle's range with one tankful matches that of 
today's vehicles. The advantage of the fuel cell is the greater 
efficiency of 30 percent compared with 17 to 20 percent of 
conventional car engines. 
  Hydrogen is generated in the automobile by means of an 
ion-permeable-polymer electrolyte membrane. The car travels 
with virtually no harmful exhaust gases, since no nitrogen oxide 
is produced during cold combustion. The only exhaust gas is 
water vapor. Consequently, the car already complies with the 
Californian zero emission requirement. Moreover, only half the 
amount of carbon monoxide is produced. This alternative form of 
power is a joint achievement of Dasa and AEG, who developed the 
project jointly with Daimler's automotive engineering division. 
Daimler is cooperating with the Canadian company Ballard Power 
Systems on the development of fuel cells. According to Reuter, 
"We have gained an important lead with synergistic effects 
within the company and in international cooperation." Daimler 
has invested hundreds of millions so far. The technology costs 
15,000 German marks per kilowatt of output. 
  Weule thinks there will be numerous potential applications 
for the fuel cell in the future. It could power railways and 
ships, provide satellites with electricity, or provide hospitals 
with an emergency power supply. 
  At present, there are five competing technologies: 
  -- Proton-conducting fuel cells operate at [a temperature 
ranging] between 20ë and 100ëC, and require hydrogen, 
which Daimler obtains from methanol; 
  -- Alkaline fuel cells have the greatest efficiency but 
require pure hydrogen and oxygen; 
  -- Phosphoric acid fuel cells operate with phosphoric acid 
at 
200ëC and are suitable as decentralized combined heat and 
power plants; 
  -- Fused carbonate fuel cells requiring temperatures of 
650ëC, are also suitable for coal gas and are likely to come 
on the market in a few years' time; 
  -- Solid oxide fuel cells are particularly efficient at 
1,000ëC but the high temperatures cause problems. 
  Daimler-Benz is going for the proton-conducting system. The 
present unit still weighs 800 kg and fills the cargo space of a 
delivery van. There will be a second version by 1996 which, at 
one eighth of the size and weighing only 200 kg, will also fit 
into a passenger car. 
<H5>  How Fuel Cells Work </H5>
  Fuel cells convert combustible liquids or gases directly to 
electricity by electrochemical means with a relatively high 
efficiency of up to 60 percent. The reaction takes place via 
hydrogen and oxygen to water. The fuel cell is made of an anode 
and cathode which are separated by an electron-impermeable 
electrolyte or a membrane. Pure hydrogen or a 
hydrogen-containing gas is passed to the anode where the 
hydrogen molecules are split into ions, and electrons are 
liberated. These flow via an external conductor to the cathode. 
At the same time, oxygen from the air is supplied to the 
cathode. The oxygen takes up electrons and the oxygen ions 
combine with the hydrogen ions to form water. 
  The hydrogen in the technology presented in Ulm is separated 
from methyl alcohol. The fuel cells operate silently and 
without vibrations, and do not develop any environmental 
pollutants. Various types of fuel cells are being developed all 
over the world, and some are now undergoing practical tests. 
Buses powered by phosphoric acid fuel cells are already 
operational in Vancouver (Canada). Fuel cells do not only 
provide power for electric cars, however: If designed on a 
larger scale, they provide an alternative to conventional power 
stations. Due to their compact, modular design, their output 
ranges from 50 kW to several megawatts.

  [Text] According to Federal Research Minister Paul Krueger 
(CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], speaking in Bonn on Tuesday, 
the federal government intends to increase the funding for 
genetic engineering research and to turn research results more 
rapidly into practice. 
  Krueger said there are already signs that important 
competitive positions of industrial companies could also change 
over the next few years due to the results of genetic 
engineering research. To ensure that Germany's advantages 
achieved in basic research are now turned into products and 
applications, Bonn intends to extend its funding. 
  As an important step in this direction, Krueger cited the 
new 
funding project, "Techniques for Deciphering and Using 
Biological Structures," which will put genome research on an 
efficient methodological basis. The Federal government intends 
to provide 100 million German marks for this research program 
over the next five years. The program, which takes an 
interdisciplinary approach, will intensify biomedical research 
and help to fight to date incurable diseases. 
  When presenting the new program, Krueger called for the 
public to pay more attention to the "important and sensitive 
area" of genetic engineering and genome research. It was 
definitely unfortunate for the Federal Republic that, for 
example, authorization procedures for the application of 
research results in this field took six to eight years, but only 
a few months in the U.S. This discrepancy should be removed. 
  For the Research Minister, genome research sets the basis 
for 
progress in bioengineering and medicine. In spite of all the 
ground yet to be made up, genome research has also developed in 
Germany over the past five years to become an innovative core 
area of modern biology. At the center lay questions of 
deciphering and using the biological structures present in 
molecular form as genetic information in cells. With the aid of 
genome research it would be possible to put medicine, industry 
(particularly the pharmaceutical industry) and agriculture on a 
"new scientific and technological basis." 
  The Research Minister made it clear that further development 
of genome research in Germany would be accompanied by legal 
framework conditions. One area requiring particular protection 
is that of data on the genetic structure of individuals. Legal 
regulations guaranteeing effective data protection and 
preventing any misuse are of prime importance. There would be 
no "see-through man," a concern often warned against in this 
respect. Appropriate government bills to amend the Code of 
Criminal Procedure or the skeleton law on employment protection 
have already been prepared. 
  Experts at the German Internists' Congress have spoken in 
favor of increasing the use of genetic engineering in medicine. 
The cancer specialist, Volker Diehl, from Cologne stated in 
Wiesbaden on Tuesday that numerous promising treatments 
involving genetic engineering methods were about to be tested in 
clinical tests. Genetic engineering therapy was often the last 
possibility for helping incurably ill patients. 
  Medicine had a "missionary zeal" to advance, said Diehl. 
However, science had made an error in not having made the goals 
of genetic engineering sufficiently clear to the public at 
large. The sole aim was to treat diseases with genetically 
improved substances or cells. Dr. Hermann Heimpel from Ulm said 
that genetic manipulations on human genetic material were 
prohibited throughout the world and were taboo amongst 
scientists, although it remained to be seen whether this 
consensus would still exist in 20 years' time.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicola Siegmund-Schultze: "Microbes Eat Up </F>
Explosive Materials -- Scientists Test Methods of Biological 
Soil Remediation on Military Site"] 
  [Text] "Zuendhuetle," meaning ignition cap, is the name of 
a residential area in Karlsruhe, and not without reason: 
Percussion caps, detonator caps and munitions for civilian 
weapons were manufactured here right up to the seventies. New 
apartments were built on parts of the factory site in the 
eighties. Today, the citizens there are wondering whether they 
may have built on poisoned land. Although the competent 
authorities knew what the site was formerly used for, they did 
not remove potential risks due to pollutant residues before 
allowing the land to be built on. Not until the beginning of 
the nineties did they start a systematic investigation. 
  The "Zuendhuetle" is only one of many examples of how slowly 
the awareness of the dangers of military legacies develops. "In 
the old German laender, people started to make a record of 
weapons waste at the beginning of the eighties; in the new 
laender they did not start until the reunification," stated 
Manfred Kurka from the Federal Environment Office in Berlin 
recently at a symposium on "Military wastes" in Offenbach. By 
the summer of last year, the authority had identified more than 
4,000 "suspect sites" of weapons wastes and informed the German 
laender accordingly. 
  There are still no uniform criteria throughout the laender 
for assessing pollution with weapon-specific hazardous 
substances. Not even the term "weapons waste" has been defined 
consistently throughout the laender. The development of 
techniques for cleaning up these legacies in an environmentally 
acceptable manner is likewise in its infancy. 
  Explosives are a particular problem. Trinitro- and 
dinitrotoluene (TNT, DNT) are frequently used. DNT is extremely 
harmful to the blood, and can cause cancer in the long term, as 
can the degradation products of TNT. Whenever these substances 
occurred in their pure form, as in munitions residues on former 
training grounds, they were often burnt in the open air, 
resulting in contaminated soil and ground water. According to 
Kruka, the only environmentally acceptable way of incinerating 
the material is currently being tested by Buck in Pinnow near 
Berlin. 
  The situation is even more complicated when the substances 
have contaminated the soil, as in Hallschlag near Daun in the 
Eifel, where explosives were once manufactured. Right up to 
1987, cows were still grazing on the former works site. It is 
now known that about 80,000 cubic meters of soil are 
contaminated. In many places beneath the grass, the 
nitrotoluenes reach such high concentrations that there could be 
explosions if drilling were carried out for testing or 
remediation purposes. Pure explosive is to be found there in 
some places. 
  Microbes could be extraordinarily helpful in dealing with 
the 
explosive inheritance. Certain types of bacteria of the 
pseudomonas strain, and also azotobacteriaceen, both natural 
soil dwellers, can thrive on TNT and DNT as a source of carbon 
and nitrogen. They degrade the explosive and convert it to 
composites from which they obtain energy or synthesize vital 
molecules. Toxic degradation products (metabolites) may, 
however, also be produced. 
<H5>  Attack by Bacteria </H5>
  Andre Dahn, an engineer at Berlin-Consult GmbH, and Peter 
Koehler from the analytical center of Forgenta in Berlin, 
presented a process at the congress with which even highly 
contaminated soils can probably be decontaminated by chemical 
and biological means in the future. Initially, they render the 
toluene water-soluble by treating the material with chemicals, 
namely a strong base, and heating it. As a result, the 
dangerous substances are altered to such an extent that 
bacterial degradation is possible, from which no toxic 
substances are expected. The cooled solution is ready for 
attack by bacteria. 
  Mixed bacteria populations are used -- including the 
explosives consumers -- which survive partly with and partly 
without oxygen (aerobic and anaerobic). It is useful to use 
such mixed populations because they often form stable 
communities and require only few additional nutrients. After 
the anaerobic reaction phase which precedes the aerobic phase, 
the researchers noticed during the experiment that just under 70 
percent of the pollutants had already been decomposed. As yet, 
however, there are no test results for the biological process as 
a whole. The Federal Environment Office considers the process 
to be promising. It is currently being optimized with a view to 
being used in Hallschlag. 
  A research group from Braunschweig Technical College is also 
considering micro-organisms for environmentally acceptable toxic 
waste remediation. At the Institute for Microbiology, Martin 
Wittmaier is working with colleagues on the question of how 
organic, aromatic hydrocarbons -- benzene, xylene, or toluene -- 
but also highly chlorinated composites and mineral oils can be 
disposed of biologically in situ. 
  Substances like these can occur and pollute soils and ground 
water wherever vehicles and machines are maintained and 
repaired, for example, on troop exercise sites. The 
Braunschweig-based scientists want to exploit the natural 
self-cleaning potential of the soil. To this end, efforts are 
being made to promote the growth of those microorganisms that 
are capable of decomposing pollutants in the earth but for which 
the earth does not provide the ideal conditions for propagation. 
  Their metabolism is specifically activated, for example, by 
introducing certain nutrients or gases by means of pipes (wells) 
inserted vertically in the soil. The microbes then multiply and 
destroy the substances to be removed. In this way, high rates 
of decontamination have been achieved in experiments. A plant 
installed on the site with which the area of a solvent recycling 
company was cleaned up achieved pollutant degradation levels of 
more than 99 percent. Such remediation measures do, however, 
take time. Depending on the degree of contamination, the process 
may take months or years. 
  The ecological damage by toxic military waste will be a 
matter of increasing concern for the government and laender in 
the years to come. The troops of the former Soviet Union are 
leaving behind "massive environmental damage" on their 1,026 
sites, according to initial research by Christina Sussbauer from 
the Free University of Berlin. She criticizes mainly the 
agreement to offset the value of the buildings and land against 
the environmental damage. As there is no financial inducement 
to hand over land "in a clean state," harmful substances and 
munitions were just left. Disorderly scrap heaps were created 
and drums with oil and other pollutants were simply thrown away 
-- adding daily to the new toxic waste.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mutant Rabbits in the Year 2000, the </F>
Future of Human Medicine"] 
  [Text] Paris--Thanks to new animal-genetics techniques, 
researchers are about to manufacture mutant rabbits and pigs 
capable of producing molecules that will cure human diseases, or 
whose organs can be transplanted in man. 
  The key to this research is transgenesis, a leading-edge 
technique used by INRA [National Institute for Agronomic 
Research] researchers for some 12 years to transfer genes from 
one species to another. One of the principal objectives of gene 
transfer is to cause mutant animals to produce some valuable 
molecules that will cure human diseases such as AIDS, 
arteriosclerosis, or the lack of red blood cells, or to be able 
to transplant animal organs in man. 
  Thus, in recent months the INRA researchers have managed to 
implant some human genes into rabbits by micro-injections, so 
that the rabbits' milk will produce factor 8 which is used to 
treat hemophiliacs, Louis-Marie Houdebine, a specialist working 
at the Jouy-en-Josas INRA, explained. 
  It is precisely to get this molecule, which is present in 
human blood and very hard to manufacture artificially, that 
hemophiliacs were getting human blood transfusions, and were 
occasionally contaminated with the AIDS virus. Another 
application about to be achieved is to have rabbit's milk 
manufacture the hormone that causes red blood cell to multiply. 
  To the great excitement of the international scientific 
community, three months ago the Strasbourg INRA, in 
collaboration with the pharmaceutical division of the 
Rhone-Poulenc group, managed to create rabbits resistant to 
arteriosclerosis by implanting in them the human genes that 
confer resistance to the disease. 
  The INRA is also researching the implantation of certain 
human genes on pigs, in order to make the pigs' organs "human" 
enough to be transplanted in man without being rejected; the 
organs include the heart, liver, kidneys, and some 
insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. This research is in the 
in-vitro stage, but the concept is working, Mr. Houdebine 
emphasized. 
  Researchers also managed to implant the AIDS receptor gene 
(CD4) into rabbits, thus creating rabbits that can be infected 
by the human AIDS virus. This type of application is of course 
precious for medical research.

  [Text] Frankfurt--Over the period 1989-1996 the Joint 
European Submicron Silicon Program, JESSI for short, will 
receive total funding of 3 billion ECU. Where JESSI has been 
employed so far the results have been top-rank. This is the 
opinion recently expressed by JESSI's chief executive, Hans 
Meyer, at a meeting of the Technical-Literary Society (TELI) in 
Munich. He said that some partial projects have led to 
technology transfer between partner companies during the last 
few months. 
  Meyer explained the knowledge and the advances that had been 
achieved with JESSI so far: in the new generations of MOS 
transistors, tunnel effects can arise at the submicrometer level 
which reduce the chip's performance. These can now be combatted 
with two proven production steps, namely the nitride-gate-oxide 
process and the Large Angle Tilted Implanted Drain (LATID) 
process. 
  A further innovation involves the transfer of circuitry 
structures onto the chip by optical lithography. In 
wafer-stepper tools the demands for precision grow with 
increased wafer size. As JESSI researches have shown, even the 
available steppers can operate with an accuracy of 0.5 
micrometers. In this case wave lengths of 365 nanometers are 
being used. With even shorter wave lengths, an accuracy of 0.1 
micrometers is said to be attainable. 
  Progress in development is also being reported for storage 
chips of the EPROM type (Erasable Programmable Memory). As has 
already been reported, JESSI distributed the first blueprints 
for a 16-megabit EPROM to partner companies. They were produced 
using 0.6 micrometer technology. 
  JESSI was created by the European Research Coordinating 
Agency (EUREKA) to work jointly on basic technologies for 
electronic chips and chip production. At the moment 185 
institutes and companies are involved, participating in 71 
individual projects.

<F P=106> [Article by T.L.: "CNES Manages its Technical Files With an </F>
Object-Oriented Database"] 
  [Text] Developed with an object-oriented DBMS 
[database management system], Baghera is a technical information 
sharing tool. It facilitates navigation among data and enables 
accessing according to specialized viewpoints. 
  Filing one's data is fine; knowing how to share them is even 
better. The CNES [National Center for Space Studies] at 
Toulouse, together with Aerospatiale Satellites at Cannes, chose 
object-oriented technologies on which to base the creating of 
Baghera, their technical-data accessing tool. Baghera was 
developed by the Espri-Concept company--which markets the 
software--using 02 Technology's object-oriented database 
management system. Aerospatiale and CNES have both validated the 
product on the basis of a project, and are now planning to 
extend its use. 
  "In the space industry, each project generates masses of 
data 
that must be accessible by all the participants (design bureau, 
project manager, office responsible for manufacturing, etc...)," 
says Jean-Luc Le Gal, head of engineering tools integration at 
CNES. A satellite program, for example, will produce 15,000 
technical documents, 11,000 models of CAD, 200 images and 
photos, and even some 100 video sequences describing 
components-integration methods. 
<H5>  Maximizing Simplification of Information Access </H5>
  The role of a tool such as Baghera is consequently that of 
facilitating the filing and accessing of these data of very 
different natures. 
  The primary need expressed by the future users of the system 
was utter simplicity of access to the information. "After a 
comparative test between a relational database and an 
object-oriented one, the latter was chosen, because it enables 
free-ranging navigation within the data," says Andre Labat, CEO 
of Esprit-Concept. In Baghera, the data are structured in the 
form of a technical flow chart. The user need only click at the 
nodes of the flow chart to obtain, step by step, all the plans, 
documents, images, and video sequences desired. By clicking at a 
CAD model displayed on the screen (a satellite), the user can 
select a component and obtain the manufacturing drawings, video 
of its integration, etc. Adding to the database is simplified, 
since creating a component in a project means adding an object 
into the base. 
  The other problem that arose in the design of the CNES's 
database was the diversity of its potential users. Each user 
needs to quickly obtain the information specific to his or her 
specialty. Baghera resolves this problem by making it possible 
to construct a specific organization of data, around the 
reference base, for each specialist. This system of "viewpoints" 
enables the design engineer, the project manager, and the 
fabrication engineer, for example, to access the data by the 
means with which each is familiar. Thus, the designer of a 
propulsion system will first display its schemas. But upon 
clicking at a piece of equipment, the designer will obtain its 
manufacturing drawings, lists of components, a video sequence of 
its assembly, etc. The links created among objects correlate the 
data modules corresponding to the different viewpoints, and 
maintain the coherence of the whole. This capacity for adding to 
the modes of access to information is being used to advantage at 
CNES and Aerospatiale to gradually bring their different 
services around to using the database. 
<H5>  A Promising Technological Marriage </H5>
  The marriage between object-oriented technologies and DBMS's 
goes back beyond just yesterday. The first object-oriented 
DBMS's came into being in 1988, and since then this niche has 
seen a relatively sizable growth featuring products such as: 
ObjectStore by Object Design, the market leader, whose French 
subsidiary was created toward the end of last year; Ontologic's 
Ontos; Servio's Gemstone; Versant and two French products that 
have succeeded in asserting themselves in this emerging market; 
ADB's Matisse; and 02 Technology's 02. To the conventional 
functions of the relational DBMS, the object-oriented DBMS adds 
its ease of adaptation and extension, as well as a respectable 
ability to manage complex and multimedia data. Technical-data 
processing is well represented in applications such as CAD, 
technical databases; network management, geographical data 
systems, etc... But the management environment is becoming 
increasingly aware of the advantages of object-oriented DBMS's.

  [Text] Bull's Distributed Computing Model has been provided 
with a first group of five reengineering software programs named 
Information Brockage Services. Their objective is to build 
dynamic management personalized systems of information flow 
inside enterprises and administrations, by making their 
applications, until now independent, communicate. 
  These programs, which operate through DPX/20 (machines), 
have been accessible since the existence of UNIX platforms, 
G-COS 7 and 8 servers and IBM/MVS machines. 
  To operate them Bull had set up a partnership program to 
which Syseca and Ibsi are already subscribers. 
  For the industrial users and distributors Bull has 
officially 
launched PDM (Product Data Management)--the SGTD (Data 
Transmission Management System) result of its agreement with 
Metaphase--and Aris, an analysis, conception and planning tool 
for information systems restructuration. PDM and Aris are 
integral parts of the DCM model. Finally, the constructor has 
added the new electronic signature safety services to ISM 
(Integrated System Management).

  [Text] Last year, Sligos' business turnover has recorded a 
slight progress. If Marben Software Engineering firm 
(specialized in real time computing and 
telecommunications)--consolidated since last July--is also 
figured in, total business turnover comes to 3.81 billion French 
francs [Fr]. Next to a constant size and rate of change this 
growth can be considered practically as being equal to zero 
(+0.4 percent). On the contrary, the net profit has diminished 
by 7.1 percent (Fr160.6 million against Fr172.8 million in 
1992). According to Sligos' CEO, Henri Pascaud, the successor of 
Gerard Bauvin--presently presiding over Clio, a holding of 
Credit Lyonnais charged with managing the bank's participation 
in the computer field: "The engineering (segment), which 
represents 35 percent of our business turnover, has decreased by 
2 percent." The finances, the second greatest component in 
Sligos' income (35 percent of the total), has recorded a 
6.5-percent growth. The means of payment activity, fueled by 
orders for memory cards and by check processing, has recorded a 
boom of 19.4 percent (Fr528 million). For 1994, Henri Pascaud 
does not predict any strong growth, unless Sligos gets new 
acquisitions.

  [Text] Bonn--German manufacturers are asking the Bonn 
government to allocate an extra 570 million German marks [DM] 
for development of the European combat plane (Eurofighter), 
announced state secretary Jorg Schonbohm 13 April. 
  The government, Schonbohm added before the parliamentary 
defense committee, is prepared to negotiate an additional DM160 
million for project modifications and extension of the fighter's 
development phase. On the other hand, it has rejected all other 
requests, including adjustments for inflation. 
  Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom agreed to

less costly alternative to the initially planned European 
Fighter Aircraft (EFA). They also agreed to postpone the 
aircraft's production phase. The German defense minister already 
spurned several manufacturer requests for additional funding 
last year. 
  The government wants to reach an agreement on the question 
with participating firms by the end of May, and inform the lower 
house of parliament, the Bundestag, of the outcome before 
summer. A Eurofighter prototype made its maiden flight on 27 
March, over one year behind schedule. Its official presentation 
is slated for 4 May. Germany is underwriting one-third of the 
project's cost.

  [Text] Paris--The NH90 military helicopter program launched 
by the Franco-German group Eurocopter "will be maintained" but 
"downsized," announced the French minister of industry, foreign 
trade, and postal services, Gerard Longuet, before the National 
Assembly 13 April. 
  In reply to a deputy's question, Longuet said that "Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard himself will present the extent" of 
the scaleback, "which will in no way affect the activities of 
the Marignane and Courneuve companies." "The export success and 
civil potential of the helicopter--since it has transport 
potential--will make it possible to support the project," in 
Longuet's opinion. The minister described the program as an 
"absolute duty," "both for its military users, the army and 
navy, and for Eurocopter company." 
  Minister Longuet pointed out that the program was costing 
France 4.7 billion French francs [Fr]. French orders for 220 
helicopters (160 for the army, 60 for the navy) would probably 
run up a bill of nearly Fr50 billion. The French market 
represents 40 percent of Eurocopter's future workload. 
  The NH90 helicopter is being developed in partnership with 
Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. The development contract 
was signed in 1992. The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill, 
which was recently submitted to the French head of state, favors 
equipment under manufacture at the expense of programs under 
study or development (prototype construction stage), such as the 
NH90.

  [Text] Toulon--"Every navy in the world, including the 
American, already envies us the Charles-de-Gaulle's combat 
system. It will enable the French aircraft carrier to track 
1,000 leads (or potential threats) simultaneously, identify 
them, and respond as needed," assert electronic engineers of the 
Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding (DCN). 
  At the tip of the Saint-Mandrier peninsula in Toulon, the 
system's designers have installed a life-size mockup of the 
future aircraft carrier's mast, which rises 74 m in height (10 
more than on the ship). Over the months, they will use it to 
fine-tune integration of the different radar, radio, and 
electronic systems that make up the "eyes and ears" of the 
Charles de Gaulle, in a real marine environment. 
  Real tests employing aircraft and ships will provide 
step-by-step verification of work quality, software, computers, 
consoles--and the whole lot's compatibility. Laboratories will 
continue ergonomic studies to design the 24 consoles that make 
up the heart of the Naval Tactical Information System (SENIT-8), 
which operators will work in four-hour shifts. 
  Everything must be ready in January 1988, when France's 
first 
nuclear aircraft carrier will begin its official, 15-month 
testing period. Until then, there is plenty of work to be done 
in Toulon, and in the some 200 French and European companies 
acting as subcontractors. 
  An unusual feature of the system is that its components were 
purchased on the commercial market, then "hardened" for military 
needs. This approach will enable engineers to upgrade all or 
part of the on-board electronics every four years, as technology 
changes. It also saved money from the outset: of the 17 billion 
French francs [Fr] the Charles-de-Gaulle will cost, Fr10 to 12 
billion are earmarked for the ship itself, and 25 to 30 percent 
for the combat system. 
  The latter must manage all the information transmitted by 
its 
six radars, the radars of the naval group's other ships, early 
warning planes (AWACS or Hawkeye), and the data supplied by the 
three satellite systems, Inmarsat, Fleetsatcom, and Syracuse. 
The combat system must control the launch of defensive weapons 
(aircraft, missiles, helicopters, decoys, etc.), and keep the 
carrier in uninterrupted contact with the Navy general staff, 
its base, any land commandos in operation, its aircraft, the 
French president, and the ship's internal communication system. 
  Consequently, the Charles-de-Gaulle--whose hull will be 
launched 7 May in Brest--will be packed with electronics. In 
addition to its radars, it will boast 80 different antennas, 
each able to carry four to five transmissions. To avoid 
interference, engineers are experimenting with different 
placement patterns on a copper mockup 1/50th the actual size of 
the ship. 
  Color symbols for each type of threat appear on the consoles 
of the operations center. The system's eight computers will 
identify and track them, rating them on a scale of rising 
danger. Once the threats' fate is sealed, the decision to 
destroy them, whether they are aircraft, missiles, ships, or 
torpedoes, is made and implemented. The naval group plays a role 
in protecting the aircraft carrier. 
  The area surrounding the Charles-de-Gaulle is broken down 
into four zones. At a distance of over 100 nautical miles, 
pursuit is guided by an on-board early warning Hawkeye plane 
(the ship will carry three) or a destroyer. Between 50 and 100 
nautical miles, the aircraft carrier's planes (Rafale or Super 
Etendard, etc.) or the nearby aerial defense support ships will 
take over. Between 15 and 50 miles, fighters and medium-range 
missiles will engage the threat. Finally, in the first zone of 
15 miles or under, the aircraft carrier's on-board defense 
weaponry will respond. Naturally, the carrier's weapons must 
avoid shooting down friendly aircraft. "On 6 June 1944," says 
destroyer captain Guillot, "90 percent of air losses were caused 
by the allies themselves, due to lack of coordination." 
  Since the Charles-de-Gaulle will often be traveling in 
international waters--as the Foch is, off the coast of 
Yugoslavia--all communication systems have been made compatible 
with those of our allies. Hence the visits of experts from other 
navies and their enthusiastic comments, which the DCN plans to 
use to "sell" the SENIT-8's "forerunner"--the SENIT-6 which 
equips the anti-aircraft destroyers Jean-Bart and Cassard--on 
the international market. Yet the SENIT-6 can only monitor 240 
potential threats at one time....

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "Weapons Manufacturers </F>
Asked to Scale Back Their Costs"; first paragraph is L'USINE 
NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] The worst has been averted. But since the new 
appropriations bill cannot pay for everything, costs will have 
to be cut! 
  The 1995-2000 military appropriations bill, which defense 
minister Francois Leotard describes as "99-percent wrapped up," 
is slated for presentation to members of parliament on 20 April. 
Though less than enthusiastic, those most concerned by the 
package--the chief contractors for military programs--are 
visibly relieved. Plans for a 0.5-percent volume increase in 
annual equipment spending over the next six years make defense 
look relatively spoiled. 
  But problems remain. Experts are unanimous that funding 
programs which are reaching maturity would have required "an 
annual 3-percent increase in the volume of appropriations." The 
difference will be made up, first of all, by asking weapons 
manufacturers to cut costs again. To that end, Francois Leotard 
organized a meeting last Thursday with defense company CEOs, who 
are prepared to acquiesce in the defense minister's request. 
General weapons delegate Henri Conze has targeted productivity 
gains of two percent a year. "We should make it," says Daniel 
Rapenne, general director of Thomson-CSF. "In the past, the use 
of (less expensive) non-military components for certain programs 
produced much greater gains." But such a switch presupposes 
coordination with the DGA as well as lower performance demands 
from the general staffs. Moreover, this type of cost-cutting can 
only be implemented for programs whose designs are not yet 
finalized, and which have not reached the industrialization 
stage. The Tigre and NH 90 (Eurocopter) helicopter programs may 
be put on a such a cost-conscious diet. 
  But that will not be enough to stay within the total package 
of some 615 billion French francs [Fr], especially since 
geostrategic planning has highlighted other needs in the areas 
of conventional equipment and force deployment capability. 
<H5>  Inevitable Adjustments </H5>
  For instance, the new appropriations bill included the 
launch 
of a tactical transport plane, the FLA (Future Large Aircraft), 
to replace now obsolete Transalls. Germany seems interested in 
signing on to the program, which would provide a workload for 
Airbus partners, but will require France to invest at least Fr33 
billion. Further adjustments of programs in progress, in 
addition to those made recently, thus seem inevitable (see 
table). 
  The fact is, France can no longer afford the structural 
increase in costs caused by the growing sophistication of modern 
weapons systems. For anyone who reads between the lines, the new 
appropriations bill will confirm this. The only way out of the 
vicious circle is to accelerate the European mergers for which 
the DGA (General Weapons Delegation) has been calling and all 
manufacturers have been preparing. 
<H5>  Uncertainty in the Electronics Industry </H5>
  With turnover of Fr36.6 billion in 1993, the electronics 
industry, which does 63 percent of its business with the defense 
sector, posted its fourth straight decline (12 percent). Total 
business has dropped by about 25 percent since 1990. But Jean 
Climaud, president of SPER (Trade Union of the Electronics and 
Radio Industries), thinks he sees a few breaks in the clouds. A 
notable cause is the stabilization of military appropriations in 
1994. The new military appropriations bill will not prevent 
painful choices, and with that in mind, SPER suggests 
concentrating on France's strengths, namely guidance, 
communication, and information systems; electronic warfare; and 
optronics. Moreover, the need to further boost the industry's 
competitiveness will prompt new reductions in staff, which will 
have to drop from 44,000 today (50,900 in 1990) to 42,000 in 
late 1996.

<F P=106> [Article: "SSBN Le Triomphant Launched"] </F>
  [Text] Cherbourg--The SSBN [nuclear powered ballistic 
missile submarine] Le Triomphant was launched on 27 March "in 
perfect technical conditions," according to an announcement on 
the 29th by the Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding and the 
Maritime Prefecture. 
  A military source explained that the launching consisted of 
filling the dock where the submarine had been built. The 
submarine will soon leave the dock and submerge at sea to a 
depth that may reach 70 meters, the same source added. 
  Following a brief cruise off Cherbourg, it will go to 
Brest--the site of the French SSBN base--early in May to begin 
its sea trials, which will last about a year. At that point it 
will be declared operational, according to the same source. 
  The cost of the Triomphant program--a total of four 
submarines are planned--is estimated at some 80 billion French 
francs.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "The New Strategic Sub `Le </F>
Triomphant' to Begin Its First Tests in the Atlantic"; first 
paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] Defense minister 
Francois Leotard was scheduled to visit Cherbourg on Friday, 22 
April, to view the latest of France's new-generation submarines, 
Le Triomphant. The underwater craft will travel to its 
Ile-Longue operational base in Brest in early May. Ten years 
after initial drawings, Le Triomphant--which will be followed by 
three other missile-launching nuclear submarines of the same 
type--will prepare to set sail for its sea tests from Brest. The 
ship will be declared "ready for active service" in the summer 
of 1996. 
  Now under the command of ship captain Francois Dupont, Le 
Triomphant was put on slipway at the Cherbourg naval shipyard 
directorate in June of 1989. But the first studies for the 
submarine began over 10 years ago, and it has been 8 years since 
the first piece of sheet metal was welded in place. 
  The goal with Le Triomphant was to build as quiet a 
submarine 
as possible, able to fire more sophisticated nuclear missiles 
than those carried aboard such first-generation ships as Le 
Redoutable and its enhanced version L'Inflexible. Hence Le 
Triomphant's undersea tonnage of 14,355, against 8,920 metric 
tons for its predecessors. This huge underwater displacement is 
similar to that of modern submarines in service in the United 
States and Russia, which meet roughly the same technical 
criteria. 
  Engineers made four specific design choices to reduce 
radiated noise and make Le Triomphant quieter during operations. 
First, they equipped it with a steel hull of very high elastic 
limit so that it could dive deeper (beyond 300 meters). Second, 
they made the submarine more hydrodynamic and streamlined its 
propeller. Finally, they insulated propulsion and auxiliary 
installations from the hull and suspended them on springs to 
avoid vibrations and shocks. 
<H5>  A Fr81 Billion Program </H5>
  Likewise, Le Triomphant carries renovated weaponry. In 
addition to defensive weapons consisting of torpedoes and Exocet 
SM39 submarine-launched missiles, the submarine will transport 
16 M45 missiles. Each M45 can disperse six nuclear 
warheads--staggered over time or space--that can strike targets 
more than 6,000 km away from their underwater launch point. 
Moreover, the M45 features penetration devices and electronic 
countermeasures to help it thwart enemy defenses. 
  France has decided to begin building three other submarines 
of the same model, two of which, the Temeraire and the Vigilant, 
have already been named. In the past, the Strategic Ocean Force 
has included as many as six strategic submarines. By 2005, that 
number will have dropped to four. Construction of the four new 
submarines is estimated to cost a total of Fr81 billion, not 
counting spending on the M45 missiles. The decision whether to 
replace the M45 in 2010 by a missile dubbed M5 is not expected 
to be made before 1997. 
  Following Leotard's on-board tour, Le Triomphant will sail 
to 
the Ile-Longue base, in the Brest roadstead, between next 2 and 
4 May. It will be presented to Francois Mitterrand on 7 May when 
the head of state travels to Brest to witness the launch of the 
first French-built nuclear aircraft carrier, the 
Charles-de-Gaulle. The prime minister is scheduled to join the 
president on his visit to Le Triomphant submarine. 
  During the following two years, the submarine will perform a 
series of sea trials--a crucial step before it enters active 
service, i.e., makes its first operational patrol. The tests to 
enable the crew--two rotating crews of 110 men each--to learn 
how to handle the ship at maximum submersion will take place in 
the Atlantic. Le Triomphant will later effect a full-scale 
launch (minus the explosive charge, of course) of an M45 
missile, and fire torpedoes and SM39 missiles. This will enable 
the Permanent Programs and Testing Committee (CPPE), which makes 
proposals concerning the rating and active service acceptance of 
the submarine to the general staff, to hand down its verdict. 
Active service is slated for the summer of 1996.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mr. Leotard Launches New Satellite </F>
Program's Defining Phase"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, 26 April, Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard announced his decision to launch the Helios II military 
observation satellite program's definition phase. Presently, 
although this initiative is purely national in scope, the French 
Government wishes other European partners--beginning with Spain 
and Italy--to become involved with this program's first phase. 
  In comparison to Helios I (two optical observation 
satellites, one of which is to be orbited at the beginning of 
1995), the Helios II program anticipates the building of four 
higher-performance satellites. Their additional infrared 
capacity will permit them to see equally at night and day, 
during cloudy weather and under bad atmospheric conditions. 
Helios I has been designed in the mold of Spot-4 civilian 
program (it uses the same platforms and image storing 
recorders), the same way Helios II resembles the Spot-5 program. 
These are 2.5-ton military satellites launched by Ariane. Helios 
II will follow Helios I beginning in 2001. 
  The Helios I program, sponsored jointly by Italy (14 
percent) 
and Spain (7 percent), has been estimated to cost 7.5 billion 
French francs. The Helios II program, a partnership of CNES 
(National Center for Space Studies), Aerospatiale, Matra and 
Dassault Electronique, should cost about the same. According to 
Mr. Leotard, "conservative measures" have been taken because 
"Italy and Spain, and eventually other European partners, can 
join the 
program"

<F P=106> [Article by J. Isnard: "Aerospatiale Warns the British </F>
Against their Refusal to Support a European Aircraft Project"] 
  [Text] Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois has warned the 
British on the consequences that their decision--expected in 
June--to modernize their military transport aircraft fleet will 
have in Europe, if the United Kingdom were to buy new Hercules 
craft in the United States, and thus exclude herself from the 
European game plan, instead of joining the European FTA (Future 
Transport Aircraft) program--to replace the (aging) 
Transalls--for which British industry would get work awarded in 
return. The fate of 50,000 employees depends on the FTA program. 
<H5>  OPIO (ALPES-MARITIMES) </H5>
<H5>  From Our Special Envoy. </H5>
  For the first time since its adoption by the Council of 
Ministers, the military program project has been publicly 
commented on by one of the most important defense 
industrialists, Aerospatiale CEO Louis Gallois. During an 
Aerospatiale seminar that took place on Monday 7 May in Opio 
(Alpes- Maritimes), he expressed his opinion on this official 
document by separating the "negatives" from the "positive 
aspects." 
  On the side of "negatives," first of all, it is the fact 
that 
"all armament programs are either to be staggered or the 
contracts reduced." On the other hand, there is the issue of 
"expertise preservation" with respect to ballistic missiles, 
ramjet engines, Helios-2 and 0siris spy satellites, as well as 
the "commitment"--coupled to a prefinancing formula in 1997--to 
the FTA project for Europe. Mr Gallois has been very unyielding 
to London on the latter program, which, in the estimations of 
Clauder Terrazzoni, the director of the group's "aircraft" 
division, will cost 25.6 billion French francs [Fr], for a total 
of three hundred aircraft. 
  Normally, it is next June when the British should say 
whether 
they will participate in the FTA project--along with the Germans 
and the French, who wish to replace the Transalls, but also 
along with the Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, the Turks and 
Belgians--or prefer to buy Lockheed's C-130 Js. The British need 
60 aircraft. 
<H5>  NH-90 Helicopter to Default. </H5>
  "But, if Great Britain does not want the FTA, the program 
will go on without her, and she will have no work contract 
awarded. The taxpayers on the continent could not comprehend the 
need to finance the part of a work that is to be given to a 
country not willing to participate in the project." Aerospatiale 
CEO has suggested to the British that if they were in such a 
hurry to modernize military fleet transport, a solution would be 
for them to "upgrade" their present Herculeses in stock, "while 
waiting for the arrival of the FTAs." "London's decision," Mr 
Gallois concluded somewhat solemnly, "is charged with 
consequences." 
  Concerning France's ambition, expressed in the program 
project, to launch a (feasability) study for a new, over 
600-km-range accuracy guided missile named APTDG, Mr. Gallois 
presented the candidacy of his group opposite to Matra's. 
According to Jean-Louis Fache, chief of "missiles" division, 
Aerospatiale's experience accumulated in ramjet propulsion, 
enables the group to design "a family of supersonic missiles 
starting from a common technological base," something which 
might lead to a 5-to-10 percent cost reduction per unit. As Mr. 
Gallois admitted, "If the solution chosen will be the ramjet, 
the question will arise as to cooperation with Matra." 
  Finally, Aerospatiale's Eurocopter subsidiary--in 
partnership 
also with the German DASA--through the voice of its CEO, 
Jean-Francois Bigay, has alluded indirectly to leaving the NH-90 
logistic (support) helicopter project, eliciting thus protests 
of seven different armies in Europe, the French army and navy 
included. 
  Officially, the NH-90 program was launched in 1992, based on 
a multinational agreement and a development cost estimation 
totaling Fr10 billion over nine years. "All disclaimers," Mr 
Bigay warned, "will result in the cancellation of a commercial 
contract," with penalties imposed by the ones affected to the 
withdrawing signatories. "We are ready," he added, "to consider 
this helicopter forfeited." Mr. Bigay made it clear that the 
NH-90 should not exceed Fr85 million (excluding taxes) per unit, 
and that in the present state, development cost reductions 
exceeding 30 percent cannot be imagined--as this has been 
demanded by France from Eurocopter--without sharply downgrading 
this European helicopter's operational performance.

<F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "An Aeronautical Studies </F>
Center"] 
  [Text] A branch of the armed forces like the air force has 
a need to invest large sums to test and study the equipment and 
materials that it possesses and those that it will adopt in the 
future. 
  Even the human factor (the pilots and the specialists) 
represent an important heritage that needs to be optimized; this 
leads to the need to unite the research centers dedicated to 
in-flight testing, the chemistry of materials, armaments, 
computers, and aerospace medicine under a single command in the 
aeronautical research, study, and testing center that is located 
near the Pratica di Mare base, on the Lazio coast south of Rome. 
  Rather than being a large military unit, the testing center 
is a complex laboratory where the aircraft and all related 
systems (including armaments and electronic equipment) are 
tested before being assigned to the flight divisions. 
  Under certain aspects the Pratica di Mare division can be 
defined as being the Italian version of the Edwards Air Force 
Base, because among the 687 military and civilians that work 
there are also 15 testing pilots whose responsibility it is to 
test the Air Force aircraft and helicopters in flight, but also 
those of the other armed forces and government bodies. The 
in-flight tests are conducted not only on newly-acquired 
aircraft (the more recent ones are the AMX fighter bomber and 
the P180 executive twin engine), but also the modifications that 
experience suggests should be made, and the upgrading during the 
operating life. 
  The most complex phase definitely concerns the flight tests 
and prototype approval: thanks to a sophisticated telemetry 
system, up to 400 parameters ranging from the aerodynamic 
performance to engine temperature and performance, to the 
behavior of external loads (bombs, missiles, containers for 
recognition instruments) are transmitted to the aircraft, 
processed by a series of computers and displayed on the monitors 
of the ground stations. 
  Here it is possible to follow the behavior of the aircraft 
moment after moment, and to intervene, suggesting to the pilot 
which corrections should eventually be made. One of the most 
interesting divisions is the laboratory for the chemistry of 
materials, which courts resort to increasingly for the delicate 
technical appraisals and investigations following aircraft 
accidents. 
  The center works closely with the leading Italian 
universities involed in aerospace research such as the Milan 
Polytechnic, La Sapienza University of Rome, and the University 
of Pisa, as well as with companies working in the sector of 
aeronautical constructions and advanced materials. 
  The studies often have a direct spin-off in the civil 
sector: 
this is the case of research into new fuels and lubricants that 
are of interest to the automotive industry for new generation 
engines, or into composite materials where it is important to 
explore the break points with revolutionary methods of 
investigation, such as laser holography. 
  The most interesting programs underway include the 
modification of some Tornados into an electronic war version 
using Texas Instruments antiradar Harm missiles for the 
suppression of enemy antiaircraft defense, and the testing of 
defense systems against infrared missiles (attracted by the heat 
of engine exhaust gases) for possible use on the G-22 
twin-engine transport aircraft. An aircraft of this kind 
belonging to the 46th Pisa Air Brigade was shot down by a SAM-9 
Soviet infrared missile during a humanitarian flight to Sarajevo 
two years ago. The laboratories of the division even determined 
what the missile was by analyzing a 5-millimeter shell found in 
the engine exhaust nozzle, thanks to the use of an electronic 
microscope. 
  An important section is the aeronautical and space medicine 
division that has focused its studies primarily on stress and 
immunity and on the problem of the sleep-waking rhythms and the 
attention levels. This research began with the pilots used on 
the Tornados during the Gulf War (1991) when the missions began 
at four o'clock in the morning. 
  The consequent need to rest during the day, at the end of 
the 
flight, led to the identification of a drug that lets people 
sleep at unusual hours without any collateral effects on the 
organism. This drug can also be taken by students suffering from 
stress before an exam.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Combat Aircraft's Maiden </F>
Flight"] 
  [text] The first prototype of the European Fighter Aircraft 
Eurofighter-2000, the French Rafale's rival, took off for its 
maiden flight on Sunday, 27 March, from the test field in 
Manching, Southern Germany. According to the manufacturer, the 
German DASA group, the 45-minute flight went without hitches. 
Scheduled for last fall, this first flight had to be delayed due 
to difficulties encountered in fine tuning the aircraft's 
electric controls. Seven prototypes will be assembled. 
  Financed by Great Britain (37.5 percent), Germany (30 
percent), Italy (19.5 percent) and Spain (13 percent), the 
Eurofighter program met with significant vexation, and, when set 
against the originally established goals, it has been delayed 
two years owing to technical, industrial and political 
disagreements between the four involved European countries. 
Series production is slated to begin only in 1996 or 1997. The 
global cost (development and production) of all the four hundred 
crafts ordered is evaluated at $47 billion (i.e., 268 billion 
French francs). 
  At the time of the program's launching, the four countries 
had announced their intentions to buy more than 760 Eurofighter 
planes. But the cost of the aircraft had forced Germany to tone 
down its ambitions, going as far as to quit the program 
altogether if the price of an aircraft could not be reduced by 
30 percent. Italy and Spain are in the same mind frame. Only the 
United Kingdom, for which this is a unique military aircraft 
under consideration, let it be known that it could buy more.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The European NH-90 Helicopter </F>
Program is Judged Essential by Mr. 
Leotard"] 
  [text] In a letter to 0livier Darrason, the 
Bouches-du-Rhone UDF (French Democratic Union) representative in 
charge of a ministerial committee for the European NH-90 
logistic (support) helicopter program, the minister of defense, 
Francois Leotard, evaluated the NH-90 "as being essential for 
our (France's) (armed) forces and for the future of the 
Eurocopter group." "Moreover," the minister continued, "the 
Government considers the aerospace programs to be real 
priorities. In spite of the difficult budgetary and financial 
context, according to the prime minister's first evaluation of 
defense programs, our defense modernization is allowed to 
continue." 
  Before the National Assembly's Defense Committee, the 
Eurocopter group's president, Jean-Francois Bigay, stated that 
"the cost of the NH-90 program has been 1.376 billion ECU," that 
is, more than 1.3 billion French francs [Fr]. The French 
participation stands at 42.4 percent (Fr1.3 billion for 
Eurocopter France and Fr3.9 billion for the French Government). 
Then Mr. Bigay added: "The cost per unit of an NH-90 is Fr85 
million" for the army, "and Fr135 million" for the navy models. 
  The four countries participating in the program (France, 
Germany, The Netherlands, Italy) ordered a total of 726 crafts, 
while the export market, outside Europe, has been estimated at 
approximately 500 "machines." Today this program is very much 
endangered by reductions of the defense budgets in the four 
participating countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Wendel: "Black Gold From Plastic Waste: </F>
Plastics Recycling Will Channel Packaging Floods -- Pilot Plant 
Starts Work This Week"] 
  [Text] About 10 million tons of plastics and elastomers are 
produced and processed throughout the year in the German 
plastics industry. In 1993, more than 280,000 tons ended up in 
the yellow Dual System (DSD) collection sacks as packaging 
waste. DSD managers expect 440,000 tons of plastic packaging 
bearing the green dot by the end of 1994, the plastics mountain 
for recycling being expected to swell to 750,000 tons by the end 
of 1986 -- much more than the recycling capacity currently 
available in Germany. However, the much-prophesied waste flood 
by no means rattles the top DSD people, who are temporarily 
afflicted by tight finances and reprocessing bottlenecks. They 
are placing their trust in a confident promise made by Plastics 
Manufacturing Industry Association chairman Albrecht Eckell: 
"The problem of plastics recycling will have been cracked by 
the end of 1998." 
  The magic formula is reprocessing into raw materials. 
Instead of just melting plastics down to make park benches, 
flowerpots, and noise insulation panels, yogurt pots, detergent 
bottles, and similar waste will be used as sources of raw 
materials. This week, the BASF chemicals group (on whose board 
Eckell sits) is bringing on stream a pilot plant in 
Ludwigshafen, where ground-down plastic waste will be liquefied 
at 400ëC then split into oils and gases. Up to 950 grams of 
petrochemical products will be distilled in this way from every 
1,000 grams of plastic and used as raw materials in the BASF 
factories. The PVC [polyvinyl chloride] component will be 
separated out as Javelle water and processed in the hydrochloric 
acid works. The plant, claims a BASF brochure, will operate 
without pressure in a closed system, so it will discharge 
"virtually no emissions." 
  The 40-million German mark [DM] pilot plant has an annual 
recycling capacity of 15,000 tons. The follow-up model, which is 
scheduled to come on stream early in the summer of 1996, is of a 
different caliber: It can reprocess up to 300,000 tons of 
contaminated, unsorted DSD packaging -- sufficient volume, 
together with the VEBA [United Electricity and Mining Works AG] 
coal-oil plant in Bottrop (170,000 tons) and the RWE [Rhineland- 
Westphalian Electricity Works] plant (70,000 tons), to meet the 
requirements of the Packaging Regulation until that date. 
  The new industrial-scale technology admittedly has one 
drawback: These expensive plants -- BASF's investment will 
amount to DM300 million -- must keep running, so they need a 
constant plastic waste input. This does away with the incentive 
to avoid creating packaging waste. In order to ensure supplies 
of DSD material, BASF is also working with the Cologne-based 
Otto Group, whose annual sales of DM1.3 billion make it one of 
the giants on the waste disposal market. Group chairman Otto 
answers objections that central plastics recycling will speed up 
the polarization process in the industry by pointing out that 
small and medium-sized disposal firms could participate in a 
"nationwide project" at 15 regional logistical centers. 
  Plastics recycling does not come cheap. The Dual System pays 
BASF DM325/ton -- about a 10th of the cost of producing a ton of 
recycled raw materials, collection, sorting, and separating the 
packaging waste taking the lion's share. One ton of crude oil 
costs DM200 on the world market. In the ultimate analysis, the 
consumer has to pay for it as well at the checkout -- the "green 
dot" is what makes this possible.

  [Text] Soil contamination with combinations of toxic 
substances, such as hydrocarbons and heavy metals, often present 
major problems. Low-cost biological reclamation processes are 
ruled out in most cases, and all that remains are costly soil 
washing or heat treatments or dumping. 
  Markkleeberg-based Biolipsia GmbH has developed a gentle 
two-stage process for this area. In the first stage, the 
adsorption agent Metasorb B is added and thoroughly mixed into 
the soil material, which is ground down to grain sizes of less 
than 20 mm. All the heavy metal ions present -- even chromium -- 
are securely bound, and after a reaction period ranging from a 
few hours to a few days, hardly any bioavailable heavy metal 
ions remain in the material. This process is irreversible over 
a very wide pH range. 
<H5>  Biological Degradation in Biobeds </H5>
  In the second stage, the organic contamination can be 
eliminated in biobeds. The pretreatment has bound all the heavy 
metals to the extent that they have no inhibiting effect on the 
enzymic activity of the bacteria that degrade the hydrocarbons. 
Other nutrients required for pollutant degradation, such as 
alkaline or earth-alkaline ions and phosphoric and nitrogenous 
salts, are not bound by the adsorption agent. 
  The company has performed successful laboratory tests over 
the last few weeks, where adding Metasorb in a ratio of 5 to 10 
percent by volume of the soil being treated achieved degradation 
rates ranging from 35 to 85 percent of the initial 
concentrations after a 15-hour mixing period followed by the 
degradation test -- with prefermented biomass over 24 hours. 
The producer's initial findings indicate that the process is 
economically viable, as the cost per tonne is only DM25 to DM80 
higher than with purely microbiological processes. 
  If biobed treatment is prolonged sufficiently, the 
hydrocarbon concentrations can be reduced to the extent that the 
material can be used for reincorporation. Long-term trials in 
Belgium have shown that no discharge of heavy metals into 
groundwater-bearing strata need be feared.

<F P=106> [Article by Herb Stanschus: "BAT For Lead Accumulators: </F>
Muldenhuetten Freiberg Soon to Have Europe's Most Modern Plant"] 
  [Text] Technical Managing Director Hans-Peter Behrendt says 
happily that something like 55,000 tons of lead and other 
materials will be recovered from approximately 5 million used 
batteries "with the most modern plant in Europe." The secondary 
lead refining plant at Muldenhuetten in Saxony will be 
modernized at an investment expense of DM30 million. 
  The project is being presented by the company Recycling und 
Umwelttechnik GmbH [Recycling and Environmental Technology] at 
the TERRATEC in Leipzig. It is contributing to the continuation 
of a positive trend: lead release into the environment has been 
reduced by 80 percent since 1985 in Germany. Muldenhuetten, 
which was first mentioned in 1395, has a tradition in this area. 
Silver production was followed there by the production of lead, 
zinc, arsenical compounds and sulfuric acids. 
  The company was adapted through technological improvements 
and new buildings to a capacity of 70,000 tons of secondary lead 
annually during the GDR era. A record chimney 200 m high became 
the new, widely visible trademark of Muldenhuetten. However, its 
environmental friendliness was limited to distributing the high 
sulfur dioxide emissions--they arose among other things through 
the thermal decomposition of the lead paste--widely over the 
surrounding countryside. In addition, the lead recycling process 
was very energy-intensive and yielded all kinds of waste: 
plastic components from the used batteries could not be 
reprocessed. 
  After reunification Muldenhuetten was threatened with 
closure. "It could only be averted by a solid solution from the 
private sector," Behrendt sums up. The Muldenhuetten business 
group was detached from the former GDR collective combine 
Saxonia AG. In 1992 the Muldenhuetten Recycling und 
Umwelttechnik GmbH was created as a subsidiary of the Rheinische 
Zinkgesellschaft [Rhine Zinc Company] of Duisburg. 
  The group in the Erz Mountains also came in contact with an 
experienced sister company on the Rhine, the BSB Recycling GmbH 
in Braubach with a related kind of production: accumulator 
recycling. It is true that they used a process which was 
categorized by the U.S. EPA as "BAT": best available technology. 
  This engineering process which had proved itself in the 
Braubach model plant is now the center of the refitting in 
Freiberg. The used batteries were completely disassembled using 
the principle of updraft sorting--a prerequisite for the 
recovery of all valuable components. 
  These are the major steps in the process: first worn-out 
starter batteries--in acid-proof containers--are brought to the 
factory in an environmentally safe manner and stored in a 
protected place. 
  The next step is mechanical disassembly and separation into 
electrodes, lead oxide-lead sulfate mixture, polypropylene, 
ebonite, PVC and used acid. The desulfurization of the 
sulfate-containing portion of the paste with alkalis produces 
desulfurized paste and sodium sulfate solution. 
  Then the charge mixtures are combined and smelted in short 
drum furnaces with high-efficiency filters for waste gas 
cleansing. The raw lead is refined and alloyed and cast into 
marketable form. 
  The new technology brings along with it many pluses for the 
environment. For example, the guidelines of the TA for air on 
the limits for toxic emissions are exceeded, in the case of dust 
and lead sometimes by up to 75 percent. Production becomes 
almost free of waste. The desulfurized lead paste is melted down 
and cast along with the grid metal; most of it is put back into 
battery production. 
  Polypropylene, from which the battery cases are made, can be 
recovered with a purity of 99.5 percent. In the form of 
compounds, which correspond to new materials in quality, they go 
out to plastics processors and are reused, for example, in 
building groups of the automobile industry. 
  Used sulfuric acid is completely recovered and can also be 
used again. The sodium sulfate which arises during paste 
desulfurization is raw material for the cellulose, glass and 
detergent industries. "Our sodium sulfate will have detergent 
quality," Behrendt promises. All that is left of the 
accumulators in the end is ebonite and PVC--about seven percent 
of the total weight; an efficient solution to reintroduce them 
into the economic cycle still needs to be developed. 
  The air is becoming cleaner in the Mulden valley and its 
surroundings: the sulfur dioxide emissions have been reduced to 
less than 10 percent compared to the earlier process. 
  But the Freiberg group is not satisfied with the traditional 
Braubach technology. They want to be the leaders in Europe in 
recycling. "We are using the opportunity to incorporate the 
newest technological details," technical head Behrendt explains. 
This includes improved short drum furnaces as well as slit 
screens with finer mesh in the sorting phase; the milling stage 
for polypropylenes is completely omitted. 
  In Muldenhuetten refitting is in full swing at the moment 
while production continues. By mid-year the simultaneous game 
will have to come to an end. Refitting for the engineering 
technology process requires the cessation of the old production. 
But then the number of employes will also have to be reduced, 
from the current 200 to 150 when modernization has been 
completed. For the two old, environmentally harmful 
blast-furnaces in the refinery which still remain will be shut 
down. 
  The Freiberg people still have one worry: their West German 
parent company, the Rheinische Zinkgesellschaft is a subsidiary 
of the Frankfurter Metallgesellschaft [Frankfurt Metal Society] 
AG. The giant company is on the verge of bankruptcy because of 
mismanagement. A banking consortium staved off the worst at the 
beginning of the year--for Muldenhuetten too, it is to be hoped. 
"The situation scarcely affected us here," says managing 
director Dr. Hans-Joachim Kessler with relief. And he adds, as a 
kind of option on the future: "We will not be a burden to the 
Metallgesellschaft."

<F P=106> [Article by Rainer Althaus: "Gentle Recycling"] </F>
  [Text] Each year some three million tons of plastic 
waste material are generated in Germany. Barely one-sixth of 
that amount is recycled. Commencing in 1996, in accordance with 
the second stage of the packaging ordinance, one million tons of 
plastic containers will be directed to the already overloaded 
recycler. Some practical solutions for waste recycling were 
discussed at the ENTSORGA Trade Fair in Cologne in mid May. 
  The chemical industry, the manufacturers of plastic 
articles, 
waste managers, the uncertain public, environmentalists, and the 
various politicians are engaged in a highly controversial 
"religious war" involving the recycling of plastic materials, 
the environment, and money--lots of money. Only one thing is 
certain in this war. As Professor Doctor Helmut Kaeufer, the 
nestor of the German plastic products recycling effort, puts it: 
"We are in the initial stages of building an entirely new 
industrial field." 
  Just what form this new industry will take remains 
uncertain. 
Summing up the present state-of-the-art, Kaeufer says: "The 
chemical industry is giving me a real fight, and if I were in 
their position I would too." 
  The difference between the plastics specialist from Berlin 
and the multinational chemical industries and waste managers 
lies in one small, but very important detail. The chemistry 
professor insists on gentle, product-oriented, material-specific 
recycling, while the industrialists want chemical and 
raw-materials recycling. The difference is that the Kaeufer 
approach calls for the old plastics to be reformed directly into 
new plastic products. However, the professor's approach is still 
by no means entirely satisfactory. The chemical industry favors 
reconverting the waste products into petrochemical raw materials 
(naphtha, olefins, aromatics, synthesis gas). Commencing in 
1996, some 300,000 tons of used plastics a year are to be 
recycled in this way in Ludwigshafen. Already 5% of this 
target 
amount is being so converted in a pilot plant, costing DM40 
million, that went into operation in April. The final plant 
design is expected to cost several hundred million German marks. 
  BASF AG and OTTO Plastics Service praise their process as a 
milestone in recycling and describe it as "an ecological and 
economic recycling alternative for mixed and impure old 
plastics." As a counterstrategy, they are publicizing "the 
permanent availability of plastics within the framework of a 
dual system" and "a definite plus for recycling." The reason for 
this is simply that neither raw-materials recycling, nor any 
other recycling or disposal method, is as yet economically 
profitable. 
  Moreover, Kaeufer considers reconversion back into a raw 
material to be efficient only for the 20% of the old 
plastic 
products which cannot be recycled any other way. New products 
can only be produced from raw materials through labor- and 
power-intensive processes. On the other hand, used single-type 
materials can be remelted through the use of a fraction of the 
power requirements. In addition, raw materials recycling 
destroys the innovative-promoting incentive to produce products 
that can be easily recycled. 
  The collection and sorting of the different pure-type 
plastics that Kaeufer's technology requires is expensive and 
time-consuming. And despite all the propaganda concerning the 
recycling "boom industry," the available industrial capacity to 
accomplish it is inadequate. As a result, the recycling industry 
is replete with scandals. Just recently 61 shipboard containers 
turned up in Vietnam with over 1,000 tons of filthy plastic 
bags, which must now be returned to Germany whence they came. 
  Against this background, the advocates of 
environment-friendly recycling fear that waste incineration, 
charitably called thermal recycling, will be increasingly used 
as the solution for recycling problems. In the face of the 
pressing waste problems throughout the country, the resistance 
of the State environmental ministers and the Federal 
Environmental Agency is rapidly melting. 
  A change in the packaging ordinance, which currently 
prescribes materials recycling, can be anticipated. Product 
recycling does more harm to the environment than product 
removal. Unfortunately, convincing evidence of this is only 
available in individual cases. Researchers and developers who 
have prescribed material-specific recycling are disappointed. 
For example, Dr. Norbert Eisenreich, a Fraunhofer scientist in 
Pfinztal Fraunhofer, complains: "We have been proposing a 
type-sorting technology for plastic waste since 1992, but 
industry remains skeptical. That's the way it is with Toepfer's 
environmental protection laws. First, things are hurried into 
being, but then they are not really followed through." 
  Dr. Hartmut Lucht, the head of Laser Laboratory Adlershof 
(LLA) in Berlin, is also dejected: "The DSD (Dual System 
Germany) does not focus on type-sorting. The disposal managers 
get their money simply by separating out the plastic waste and 
pressing it." 
  But there are encouraging signs: 

  -  Europe's most modern, 
DM30 million recycling plant--the VEKA Environmental Technology 
GMBH for windows, shutters, plates, and profiles made of PVC has 
been in operation in Behringen, Thueringen, for months. Because 
of PVC's chlorine content (comprising 10 to 15% of its 
total 
mass, this controversial plastic is especially advantageous for 
long-service-life products in the construction industry and, 
according to the latest eco-reports, is more desirable than 
aluminum or wood. Old PVC can now be recycled into new window 
profile sections. These frames consist of 80% recyclates 
and 
20% new PVC for the outer layer. Even the old GDR plastic 
windows made of wood and plastic casing can be recycled in 
Behringen. 
  -  After two and a half years of developmental work, the 
Poschmann Company of Luedenscheid, a producer of precision parts 
made from expensive thermoplastics like polyamides and 
polycarbonate (DM6 to DM10 per kg), succeeded in processing old 
parts into a recyclate that substantially duplicates the primary 
material. 
  -  Triumph-Adler AG (TA) recently solved the essential 
problem of having its product returned for recycling by selling 
their typewriter ribbon cassettes in eco-boxes. The customer 
sends the cassettes containing the used ribbon back to the 
company which then, using the regranules, produces casing parts. 
In 1991, the TA recycling center took in about 94,000 returned 
cassettes, one year later the number was 160,000, and in 1993 a 
total of 212,000 had been received. 
  -  In its production of 
semifinished products and equipment parts made from polyamides, 
Huettig GmbH in Camburg, Thueringen, avoids waste and the need 
for recycling. Form casting, spray casting, and special extruded 
profiles keep the amount of waste to a minimum. Rather than 
returning left overs to the production cycle, they are 
depolymerized into lactam, the raw material for nylon 
fiber. 
  -  Since the beginning of the year, Regra GmbH in 
Primasens-Gerbach has also been practicing chemical recycling 
that is very close to material-specific recycling. The company 
has invested DM1.7 million in Germany's first ever plant for the 
recycling of PUR shoe sole waste. The 70 tons of the company's 
own production wastes, valued at DM400,000, no longer land in a 
waste dump. Moreover, the high capacity of the plant opens up 
recycling jobs to other PUR workers. In the recycling process, 
the waste plus polyalcohol is restructured into a dispersion at 
200ë Celsius. Naturally, a specific PUR formulation is 
required. 
  -  BASF Schwarzheide GmbH has successfully tested a 
glycolysis for recycling mixed PUR foams as, for example, those 
from automobile seats. For some time now, the production left 
overs of an automobile supplier have been processed using this 
technique. 

  Recycling can become the driving force in 
economic development. With a market share of 19.8%, as 
against 
the United States' 16.7% and Japan's 13.0%, 
Germany leads the 
world market in products protecting the environment.

  [Text] The CORD [chemical oxidation reduction 
decontamination] process has successfully been used to 
decontaminate a nuclear power station reactor pressure vessel 
for the first time in the world. CORD, which was developed by 
the power generation (KWU) division of Siemens AG, has thus 
proved its efficacy in this field as well. 
  In addition to the reactor pressure vessel, all four 
circulation loops and the reactor water purification and 
residual heat removal system in the Swedish Oskarshamn 1 nuclear 
power station (442 megawatts) were decontaminated in 13 days. 
The test results available to date show that well over 99.6 
percent of the radioactivity was flushed out, in other words 
that the average decontamination factor was much greater than 
200. 
  This process makes it possible to convert all the chemicals 
involved into carbon dioxide and water without residue, even 
while the decontamination work is still under way. On 
completion of decontamination, therefore, the water reacquires 
demineralized water quality. The dissolved cations and 
radioactivity have been removed by the ion exchanger filter in 
the reactor water purification system, thus requiring no 
additional ion exchanger. Once the reactor pressure vessel had 
been hosed out with high-pressure water, it showed only a 
"residual wipe-off activity" of about 4 Bq/sq.cm. The dose rate 
at the bottom of the vessel was lowered by more than 20 mSv/h to 
under 0.02 mSv/h, and this extremely low radiation level now 
makes it possible to carry out the relevant tests and repair 
work. 
  Following the positive results obtained with CORD, 
Siemens-KWU has been commissioned to undertake a similar job in 
Finland, where the 300-cu.m primary system of the Lovlisa 
nuclear power station is scheduled for decontamination in August 
1994.

<F P=106> ["German-Saudi Arabian Research Project `Hysolar' Reports </F>
First Success"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart--The German-Saudi Arabian research project 
"Hysolar" has reported its first success. For the first time 
ever, in the Arabian desert, 40 kilometers northwest of the 
Saudi capital Riyadh, hydrogen has been produced technically in 
a procedure involving the direct coupling of solar power 
generation and the electrolysis of water. Researchers from the 
German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) have been working on 
this project since 1986 at Stuttgart University with their Saudi 
colleagues from the King Abdulaziz City of Science and 
Technology (KACST) in Riyadh and the universities in Jeddah, 
Riyadh, and Dharan. 
  Gerd Eisenbeiss of the DLR, chairman of the German steering 
committee, called the start-up of the solar cell-powered, 
350-kilowatt-electrolysis plant in KACST's Solar Village a 
milestone. Eisenbeiss describes the accomplishment as follows: 
"The production of storable and transportable hydrogen is proof 
that a scenario incorporating solar power imports from the Sun 
belts of North Africa and Arabia is technically possible." 
  Studies relating to "Hysolar" prove that the hydrogen in 
future power supply systems having a highly regenerative power 
share can increase supply reliability. To be sure, the 
researchers admit frankly that solar hydrogen will only become 
economically attractive when the solar electricity required for 
the electrolysis process can be obtained substantially cheaper 
than it is today by means of photovoltaics and solar power 
plants, which utilize the concentrated sunlight thermally. 
  Eisenbeiss notes further that in order to optimize the 
entire 
system and to further develop the electrolysis technology, more 
work is needed. Unfortunately, financial support for the project 
is only assured until the end of 1995. Additional investments 
must follow after the DM76 million already granted. To this 
point, "Hysolar" has been financed half by Germany and half by 
Saudi Arabia. On the German side, the Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology and the Baden Wuerttemberg Ministry for 
Science and Research share the costs. On the basis of the 
system's present still unsatisfactory 5% efficiency level, 
Saudi Arabia's "solar resources" could, were solar power 
utilized ideally on only 1% of its land surface, deliver 
the 
same amount of energy that is currently exported yearly as 
petroleum. The researchers are certain that in several years 
more advanced photovoltaic electrolysis plants could reach an 
average efficiency level of 10%. "But," Eisenbeiss 
concludes, 
"we shall never reach a price of five pfennigs a kilowatt as is 
the case for natural gas."

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Michel Meyer: "Toxic Waste: Cannibalistic </F>
Supermolecules"] 
  [Text] Supermolecular chemical laboratories are creating 
"cage molecules" capable of recognizing and capturing toxic 
atoms or molecules. They can help reduce the volume of dangerous 
waste products. 
  Is antipollution technology going to be revolutionized by 
microscopically small creations? Within the space of only a few 
weeks, two supermolecular chemical laboratories, in Strasbourg 
and Lyons, have produced several decagrams of two types of "cage 
molecules," veritable "chemical prisons"! 
  Their respective shapes (a "cup" for the calycinals, a 
"Chinese hat" for the cryptophanes) express their mission: to 
recognize and trap certain toxic atoms or molecules in 
made-to-order cavities. A reversible process: Once separated 
from other less harmful waste products, the trapped molecules 
may be released for processing. 
<H5>  High Precision </H5>
  The highly selective molecular traps are in greatest demand 
by the nuclear and chemical industries. Calycinals attract atoms 
of cesium-135 and cesium-137 into their cavity, while the 
cryptophanes trap hydrocarbon and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) 
molecules. 
  "A world first," says Professor Alain Collet, head of the 
stereochemistry and molecular interaction laboratory at the 
Ecole Normale Superieure, in Lyons. Manufactured from the 
vanillin molecule, the fifty-some-odd members of the cryptophane 
family already come in a variety of sizes. But this is the first 
time any laboratory has synthesized cryptophanes able to capture 
highly volatile molecules of very small size. 
  Work on this scale must be ultra-precise: The cage molecule, 
whose volume is 160 to 180 cubic angstroms, must capture a 
methane molecule whose volume is only 28 cubic angstroms! 
Identical results have been obtained with ethane and propane. 
Also with two CFCs, freon-12 and freon-22, "but less 
efficiently," says Andre Collet. 
  Meanwhile, three researchers with the Laboratory of Analytic 
and Mineral Chemistry, a unit associated with the CNRS [National 
Scientific Research Center] and Strasbourg's European Advanced 
Chemical Industries College, have developed a gamut of 
calycinals that can extract 99.9 percent of the cesium from a 
solution. The results were obtained as part of the "Spin" 
(separation-incineration) program under the direction of the 
Atomic Energy Commission's Cadarache Research Center, in 
partnership with five European universities. "The calycinals 
behave like chemical clamps," explains Jean-Yves Barre, the 
Commission's fuel cycle director. And with formidable 
efficiency: The molecule can pick out one cesium atom from 
45,000 sodium atoms in an acidic decontamination solution! 
<H5>  Shrinking the Volume </H5>
  The objective: "To reduce the volume of slow-decaying waste, 
in order to cut the storage volume by a factor of three or 
four," he explains. Extracting the irradiated fuel from fission 
products such as cesium-137 and cesium-135 (which have 
radioactive lives of 30 and 2,300,000 years respectively) and 
the minor actinides (americium, neptunium, etc.) would remove 
some of the current constraints on storage of radioactive waste. 
Once purged of the most highly radioactive elements, nuclear 
waste could be stored on the surface instead of buried deep 
underground. But that is 10 or 15 years into the future. That's 
how long it will take for fabrication of calycinals to get from 
the laboratory to commercial production. 
  Already, however, the Electrochemistry Laboratory at the 
University of Rennes has made an important advance in treatment 
of primary circuit effluents at nuclear generating stations. 
Using electrochemical techniques, researchers there have 
synthesized ion-transporting polyether resins attached to carbon 
molecules, to trap radioactive ions (silver of atomic weight 
110, cobalt-60, cesium-137, and potassium-40) in water solution 
at concentrations lower than 1 microgram per liter. Larger-scale 
tests of this technology are under way at the EDF [French Power 
Company] research center at Tricastin. 
  Initial successes in applying supermolecular chemistry to 
the 
antipollution domain are promising. In Strasbourg, efforts are 
under way to synthesize new calycinals to capture other 
radioactive elements (americium, etc.). And still other 
calycinals to imprison aromatic molecules (benzene, 
methylbenzene). These could be used to purify water or organic 
solvents by removing aromatic nuclei. 
  In Lyons, researchers are designing complex structures "that 
will not only recognize and capture but also transform," 
explains Alain Collet. By inducing catalysis, these new cage 
molecules should make it possible to transform methane into 
methanol, which is much more easily transportable. 
  But the industrial future of the cryptophanes rests on their 
potential as "captors." Elf hopes to employ them in systems to 
detect leakage of natural gas and other hydrocarbons.

<F P=106> [Article by Edoardo Cagnazzi: "Vegetable Diesel Oil, </F>
Biopalma, Is Here"] 
  [Text] Naples--Clean, sulfur-free fuel that is extracted 
entirely from plants and is made of soya, rape, and sunflower 
oil. For the time being this is almost a pioneer initiative but 
it opens up a new frontier in the production of a vegetable 
diesel oil, which is an alternative to diesel oil, and also with 
a more acceptable performance in terms of heating and urban 
pollution. The sophisticated technology for the production of 
Biopalma, which is the name under which the diesel oil produced 
from vegetable oils will be marketed, is a project of the Palma 
distillery. A company that is part of the Neopolitan 
agroindustrial and biochemical Palma company with annual 
revenues of 550 billion Italian lire. Its holding company, 
Palfin, controls four sectors of activity. Distillation, with 
plants in Campania (Palma company), Puglia (Trani), and Sicily 
(Vinum Marsala and Trapas Trapani). The plants of Bari Palolio 
and Palvino operate in the oil sector; Chirico and Campano in 
the food sector. Finally the sole biotechnology plant is 
located in Calitri. 
  The fuel, say its producers, will revolutionize the fuel 
market within the coming years because it does not contain 
sulfur, the major cause of acid rain. This fuel was inserted in 
the Ruffolo- Conte decree two years ago to prevent pollution in 
urban areas and is currently being tested by several transport 
companies (AIM and Vicenza, AMT Trieste, ACAP Padua, ATM Milan, 
SEPSA Naples, and others). Since Biopalma is obtained from 
renewable sources it does not impoverish natural resources and 
drastically reductes polluting emissions from both heating 
systems and vehicles.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Amsterdam To Have Europe's Largest </F>
Solar Energy Project"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam--By next year Amsterdam will have the 
largest public housing solar energy project in Europe. 
Commissioned by the Amsterdam Energy Company [EBA], 66 homes in 
the district of Nieuw-Sloten are to be provided with 
photovoltaic cell systems. Danish, Italian and Spanish partners 
are following the progress of this large-scale, European 
Community demonstration project with great interest. 
  The recent promise of financial support from the European 
Community and Novem (Netherlands Organization for Energy and the 
Environment) has helped the Amsterdam project a great deal 
along. "Certainly because it concerns the first, large-scale 
project in Europe in which solar energy is wholly included in 
home architecture," says project leader J. Cace, of the 
management department of the EBA. She points out the fact that 
there will be no orange roof tiles on the roofs, but only dark 
blue solar boards. The total surface of the photovoltaic cell 
systems is 2,500 square meters, and the capacity of the solar 
cells is 250 kW. The foundations for the project will be laid 
in September of this year; the completion of the solar houses is 
planned for May 1995. 
<H5>  Public Network </H5>
  Another striking part of the project is the fact that the 
electricity which will be produced will not go directly to the 
occupants of the houses but to the public network. Via the 
medium and low voltage network the current will go back to the 
district. "This way even houses that do not themselves contain 
solar cells will profit from the clean solar energy," says Cace. 
Through the use of solar energy, the inhabitants are able to 
reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere by 135 tons of 
CO2, 300 kilograms of SO2, and 376 kilograms of NOx. 
  The solar cells are made by R&amp;S Renewable Energy 
Systems in 
Helmond and BP Solar in Leatherhead (United Kingdom), each of 
which is responsible for half of the cost. In addition to the 
commissioner, EBA, Ecofys is also taking part in the project. 
The project has also drawn the attention of other EC countries, 
which have similar plans. Participants are the PV Applications 
Center in Newcastle, Sermasa from Madrid, Miljokontrollen of 
Copenhagen, and the Institute Cooperatieve per Innovatione in 
Genoa. Case again: "Finally, it is an important demonstration 
project for Europe because it will, for instance, provide more 
insight into increases in scale, and the economic advantages of 
full integration of solar cells in the construction and power 
supply by district."

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Michel Meyer: "Elf Creates an </F>
Anti-Pollution Center"; first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE 
introduction] 
  [Text] The group's Norwegian subsidiary houses its 
new laboratories to study marine hydrocarbon pollution and ways 
to combat it. 
  The 19 March inauguration in Norway of the Akvamiljo center 
to study marine hydrocarbon pollution was a watery one, marked 
by snow, rain, and hail showers. Built by Elf Petroleum Norge 
(EPN) at the mouth of the Boknafjord on the west coast, the 
center is only five kilometers from EPN's headquarters in 
Stavanger. The center's mission, explains its assistant director 
Bertrand Gaudebert, is "to learn more about the risks of our 
industry's impact on marine environments, and to devise ways of 
cleaning up pollution and restoring sites." 
  Akvamiljo is the second research center, after its 
geophysics 
institute in London, that the petroleum group has established 
outside France. "We found the scientific marine environment 
expertise we needed in Norway," adds Bernard Gaudebert. EPN and 
Rogalandsforskning, Stavanger county's semi-public research 
institute, have signed a 10-year collaboration agreement that 
calls for the latter to supply nine of the 11 researchers that 
will work at Akvamiljo. The specialists will be drawn from the 
fields of chemistry, marine biology, zoophysiology, immunology, 
and microbiology. 
  Elf will pursue the EUREKA Bioren project to study 
hydrocarbon biodegradation--on which it has been laboring for 
several years--in Norway. The program is underwritten by EPN, 
Elf France, the French Petroleum Institute, and 
Rogalandsforskning. Bioren aims to refine our knowledge of the 
mechanisms involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation, and to 
improve the effectiveness of biological treatments as a function 
of ocean conditions, the salt content of the water, the type of 
hydrocarbon pollution, and so on. It also seeks to model the 
effects of the additives used to biodegrade hydrocarbons, in 
keeping with the characteristics of the polluted site. 
  The bulk of the center's marine ecotoxicology work will 
consist of helping devise standard microtoxicology tests in 
conjunction with other European research laboratories. The tests 
will measure the impact of chemicals employed in offshore oil 
work on living organisms such as crustaceans, turbot larva, and 
algae. 
  To gauge the effects of marine pollution on animal and 
aquatic life, Akvamiljo researchers are putting together 
biosensors. The scientists' goal is to find a marker of past 
pollution "carried" by living organisms. Such a marker might 
consist of DNA damage or fish otoliths--that is, mineral stones 
of the calcium carbonate that is present naturally in living 
organisms. Powerful analytical tools such as laser or 
electron-scanning microscopes could then be used to detect heavy 
metals or other substances that had accumulated in the stones. 
  Improved techniques to clean up drilling refuse aim to 
extract the hydrocarbons in drillings and oil sludge (introduced 
through the drag bit, they do not dissolve salts and thus 
prevent the formation of cavities in the rock). An extraction 
and cleanup process using supercritical CO2 is under 
study. The technique will enable oil companies to send drilling 
waste from which all traces of hydrocarbons have been removed to 
the bottom of the ocean. 
  The center's final goal is the development of 
technologies--notably techniques to prevent accidental 
spills--to combat hydrocarbon pollution. Specific sensors acting 
as sentinels in the buoys of offshore or port areas could be 
used to detect abnormally high hydrocarbon rates. 
<H5>  Studies with the Group's Ocean-Drilling Subsidiaries </H5>
  The Akvamiljo center, which is wholly financed by the oil 
group's Norwegian subsidiary at a cost of Fr32 million, is open 
to any Elf entity. It will conduct joint studies with the 
southwestern laboratories; with Atochem's fresh water research 
center and its subsidiary Ceca, which has developed a nutrient 
that speeds up the biodegradation of hydrocarbons; and with any 
Elf subsidiary that drills at sea, from Norway to Guinea, 
Angola, or Gabon. 
<H5>  Elf Akvamiljo's Facilities </H5>
  The center's 11 researchers work in 4 research laboratories 
that occupy 1,700 square meters of buildings housing 
sophisticated equipment. 
  The chemical analysis lab, for instance, can measure 
infinitesimal traces of pollutants in tissue through the 
combined use of gas or liquid chromatography and mass 
spectrometry. 
  The center also boasts a fermentation and microbiology 
laboratory with classic tools such as autoclaves, etc. It allows 
researchers to work in a controlled atmosphere. 
  Finally, the ecotoxicology lab can recreate cold, tropical, 
or warm atmospheres. It includes an experimental building for 
reproducing various marine conditions such as tides, rocky or 
sandy beaches, and so on. The water required for research is 
drawn from the fjord at a depth of 80 meters and a rate of 12 
cubic meters an hour. After use, it is treated in a wastewater 
station and returned to sea. 
  Akvamiljo has an operating budget of Fr16 million a year. 
<H5>  Biodegradation Know-How That Works </H5>
  Name: Inipol EAP 22. 
  Creator: Ceca (Elf group) 
  Feat of arms: made it possible to speed up the natural 
breakdown of hydrocarbons (bioremediation) spilled on Alaskan 
beaches following the wreck of the Exxon Valdez in 1989. Inipol 
EAP 22 is a nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient that stimulates the 
growth of many microorganisms in the marine environment which 
are capable of breaking down hydrocarbons.

  [Text] The European Union has awarded a significant subsidy 
to the Netherlands Gas Laboratory to examine, in cooperation 
with other European companies, the possibility of improving the 
"reformer," the essential element for the operation of fuel 
cells. The reformer enables methane to be converted into 
hydrogen. The goal would be to create a reformer which is 
smaller, more efficient, more esthetic, and cheaper, and which 
kicks off faster. 
  A number of industrial partners are interested in the 
project. The ultimate goal is that Europe would have at its 
disposal an ultramodern technique in the field of fuel cells so 
as to strenghten its competitive position in a market where the 
Japanese and Americans have made great strides. The real 
project started in December and will continue for three and a 
half years.

<F P=106> [Article: "Major Opportunities for Tiny Structures"; </F>
Subhead: "Micro- and Nano-Structure Engineering: Fantastic 
Innovations on Prototype Scale"] 
  [Text] Mainz, 8 April 1994--Micro- and nano-structure 
engineering is calling attention to itself with fantastic 
innovations on the prototype scale that will in fact decisively 
alter our technical environment and even the quality of our 
lives in a few years. New growth markets are beginning to 
develop for micro-structure products and industrial nations are 
preparing for a new technology race with support programs 
measuring in the billions. In the following article, professor 
Wolfgang Ehrfeld of the Institute for Microengineering [IMM] in 
Freiburg, describes the current situation. 
  Critical functional elements of modern engineering are 
growing increasingly smaller, attaining molecular dimensions, 
and at present it is even possible to manipulate individual 
atoms. Concurrently, the level of integration is increasing. In 
microprocessors and memory chips many millions of transistors 
are combined on a single tiny silicon chip and the 
billion-threshold, the gigabit chip, no longer appears to be so 
far removed. Together, miniaturization and integration are the 
engine for engineering progress. Micro- and nano-structure 
engineering is becoming the basis of our future security. 
  Internationally, microsystems that combine micromechanical, 
microoptical, microacoustic, microthermal and other 
microfucntional elements with microelectronics, constitute the 
technological basis for modern products. There are markets for 
microstructural products everywhere: automation, information and 
communications engineering, automotive engineering, aerospace, 
chemical process engineering and entertainment electronics 
deserve mention here along with medicine and bioengineering. 
  Research is still unambiguously uppermost in the case of 
nanostructures, thinking here of molecular storage devices or 
so-called "quantum devices." When considering films of a few 
layers of molecules or atoms, however, that are decisive for the 
operations of many chemical and biological sensors, for 
optoelectronic components or for diverse, technically relevant 
interface phenomena, then nanoengineering -- quite apart from 
the scanning tunnel microscope and its various derivatives -- is 
already a significant economic factor. 
  The technological basis for the manufacture of 
microstructural products developed from semiconductor 
engineering, precision mechanics and optics. It is possible to 
produce high-precision three dimensional microstructures using 
anisotropic etching of single-crystal materials, dry etching 
processes with low-pressure plasmas, with electron, ion and 
laser beams or using depth lithography with x-ray beams. It is 
possible, using casting, stamping, electroplating or other 
shaping processes, to replicate such microstructures, if 
necessary, with nanometer precision, over and over again and to 
transfer them into other materials. 
  The compact disk [CD] is an example of the success of this 
type of replication design, wherein semiconductor 
microlithography, thin-film engineering and ultra-precision 
injection molding are in synergy. Using lithography, 
electroforming, casting [LIGA] engineering, developed in 
Germany, based on a combination of depth lithography, 
electroforming and shaping, the two-dimensional CD replication 
process is extended into the third dimension of microstructure 
engineering and an inconceivably broad diversity of products is 
developed, as demonstrated by the IMM in Mainz at the research 
and technology innovation market of the Hannover fair on the 
basis of microsensors, micromotors, microoptical systems, etc. 
  The extensive menu of microsystems engineering is 
exemplified 
through many other examples: Friedrich-Schiller university in 
Jena is displaying as a microsystem optical chips for laser 
doppler anemometry and magnetic sensors based on squids for 
accurate administration of ion rays in tumor therapy; 
Hamburg-Harburg technological university [TU] is presenting 
chemical gas sensors; and Bayreuth university is displaying the 
effectiveness of nanotechnology by means of materials research 
using combined scanning power and friction microscopy. 
  Absent materials research, micro- and nano-structure 
engineering are inconceivable and in this case the innovation 
market demonstrates many new approaches. We may mention here: 
Mossbauer spectroscopy (Goettingen university); the use of RFQ 
accelerators (Framkfurt university); high-resolution computer 
tomography (federal department for materials research); 
time-resolution materials research using the emissions electron 
microscope (Mainz university); analysis of extremely thin films 
using the Brewster angle microscope (Goettingen NFT GmbH) and 
differential reflectometry (Vilseck ATZ. 
  To be sure, this is only a tiny portion of the broad 
technological basis for micro- and nano-structure engineering. 
But it is one approach to engineering progress in products, 
materials, testing processes, production engineering and 
applications in virtually all sectors of modern engineering. 
  Already in existence today as prototypes on the laboratory 
scale are: chemical analysis systems that are no larger than a 
sugar cube; micromotors that have been engineered together with 
ultrasound sensors and micromechanical instruments for vascular 
and neurosurgery in catheter systems having a one to two 
millimeter diameter; microsensor rays for the most diverse 
measurable quantities; and a multitude of micromechanical, 
microoptical or fluid engineering components. Using modern 
production methods of microengineering it is possible to produce 
various inexpensive connections for monomode glass fibers for 
optical data transfer with submicrometer precision and 
integrated switch or multiplex functions as well and photonics 
microcomponents are being developed for optical computers. 
  As fantastic as such applications may seem at present, it is 
also equally certain that in the foreseeable future our daily 
lives will be inconceivable without them. Still, microsystems 
for medicine, the new energy-saving injection system, that can 
be realized only with microengineering methods, the microsensors 
in tennis rackets or in the safety bindings of skis and many 
other micro-, and in the future, nano-structure products, can be 
produced inexpensively only if there are professional production 
equipment, product-specific materials, semi-finished products 
and fabricated products, design tools and a plethora of services 
in the hardware and software sectors and, of course, also in 
marketing and sales. 
  The federal ministry for research and technology has already 
allocated 400 million German marks [DM] for the support of 
microengineering and another 600 million is supposed to be 
forthcoming in the follow-on program, as the minister for 
research reported in February. Combined projects, in which a 
number of firms and research facilities are each participating, 
are foremost in this context and are supposed to accelerate 
progress through cooperation and a division of labor. 
  Compared to the outlays by other industrial nations or the 
total amount that the European Union [EU] plans to allocate to 
microsystems engineering in the fourth framework program, a 
support volume of a total DM1 billion is very significant. But 
even in the U.S. and the Far East, the key function of micro- 
and nano-structure engineering has been acknowledged for a long 
time and they have developed their own strategies for success. 
It is not just the amount of the support total, but rather the 
strategic approach that is decisive in a broad spectrum 
technology in which producers of microstructural products have 
to cooperate closely with their users as well as suppliers of 
production equipment, materials manufacturers and special 
services firms. 
  In microengineering, both Japan as well as the U.S. have 
demonstrated that they have better concepts of cooperation and 
innovation than Germany or Europe. Still, international 
technological competition in micro- and nano-structure 
engineering has just begun. A visit to the research and 
technology innovation market and an exchange of ideas with the 
exhibitors may contribute to progress through cooperation in a 
key technology.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Demand for Lean Production in </F>
Assembly and Handling Technology"] 
  [Text] Assembly and handling are, also from a 
business standpoint, important components of all manufacturing. 
During production, parts and tools must be available at the 
right time and at the right machine. Flexibly automated 
solutions for all requirements are helpful with this. 
  The integration of sensors, electronics, image and data 
processing in assembly and handling technology leads to cost 
reduction even for small lots. Lean production here as well. 
That does not, however, mean simpler or trimmed-down technology, 
but rather more automation, more flexibility, yet in less 
complex and thus more easily comprehensible units. 
  Demands for shorter cycle times, greater reliability and 
availability, greater precision with consistent quality and 
lower costs can for the most part only be met with automated 
assembly and handling. [Working conditions which] take their 
toll on workers' health, such as heavy, noisy, monotonous 
activities, can be minimized or eliminated entirely. Procedures 
carried out in extremely dangerous environments can, in fact, 
only be done with automation. 
  Automation in Assembly Becomes Increasingly 
Extensive 
  In 1992 the German assembly, handling and industrial robots 
(AHI) industry had sales of 3.9 billion German marks [DM] 
compared with DM4.1 billion in the previous year. In 1993, there 
was no impetus in either the domestic market or in exports, so a 
decline of 5 to 7% in sales is to be expected. Along with 
assembly technology and handling technology--including 
industrial robots--standard components and peripherals for 
systems technology are also part of the AHI industry. "We 
estimate the 1992 sales for this group at DM1.1 billion," says 
Dr. Ing. Heinz Muno, director of the Assembly, Handling, 
Industrial Robots (AHI) trade association in Frankfurt am Main. 
This corresponds to a 26%-share of the industry's total 
sales. 
Standard components and peripherals round out assembly and 
handling equipment as complete systems. 
  Assembly technology and handling technology each received 
about DM1.4 billion, or 37% apiece. A shift in this share 
is 
becoming apparent for 1993. Continued development of sensor 
technology and control and process control technology is making 
automation of complex assembly processes progressively easier. 
The proportion of business done in assembly technology and 
standard components and peripherals is increasing 
correspondingly, while handling technology has already reached a 
high level of automation. 
  The export quota for the approximately 200 mostly mid-sized 
companies in the German industry averages 35%. The 
importance 
of the countries of the European Community as trade partners for 
these companies can be illustrated with the example of 
industrial robots. For 1992, exports came to 181 million German 
marks, 75% of which remained within the internal market. 
Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy were in first place as buyer 
countries with 18% each, followed by France at 15%. 
  Machine building is gradually rebounding from the depths of 
the recession. The assembly and handling technology companies 
are providers and outfitters for the entire industry. Because of 
this, however, they are also dependent on the economic situation 
of their buyers. The difficult worldwide economic situation 
correspondingly affects foreign as well as domestic demand in 
this field of automation. 
  Important consumer areas such as machine building and the 
automobile and the electronics industries have for some time 
been experiencing substantial setbacks in incoming orders. For 
German machine building, for example, talk is of the deepest 
recession in the last 40 years. The initially normal cyclical 
slowdown in the economy has become aggravated by the fact that 
since 1992 all other industrial nations--and thus trading 
partners--have also found themselves in a tailspin. Yet the 
beginning of the decline in economic activity was certainly 
variable in the individual countries: first the symptoms of 
weakening in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the United States; 
then Germany's drop, and finally the dramatic decline in Japan. 
  In 1993, the demand for machines in West Europe as a whole 
declined about 8%. That, however, only resulted in a loss 
of 
5% for production, since exports to North and Latin 
America, 
Asia and East Europe as well have gone up. Because of the great 
importance of the internal market as a sales arena for European 
companies, the increase in exports to countries outside the 
Community cannot compensate for the weak demand in the home 
market. Some European countries have, however, already reached 
the bottom of the recession, while others are already even able 
to record a growth in machine production. Among these are the 
Scandinavian countries (with the exception of Denmark), Great 
Britain, Ireland and Italy. 
  Exports and thereby--at long last--machine production, 
especially in Italy, are profiting from the [currency] 
devaluations in the course of last year's turbulent monetary 
conditions. Low interest and pressures to modernize and 
streamline could also contribute some impetus. German machine 
production can assume for 1994 a mild revival of output of 
2% 
in real terms. This is supported substantially by overseas 
exports. The West European demand for machines will probably 
stagnate. 
  Machine Production Will Emerge from the Recession in 
Better Shape 
  The same is true for domestic demand to the extent that it 
is 
not dependent on exports. The cyclical fluctuations in the 
economic situation could be surmounted by 1995 and 1996. Machine 
production might count among the winners, not least because many 
companies are using the recession to restructure. They will 
emerge from this process in stronger condition. 
  The companies of the AHI industry stand by their customers 
as 
reliable partners in automation with innovative and customer- 
specific solutions and appropriate service provisions. "Module 
technology" permits flexible planning of production and simple 
reorganization--a contribution to the competitiveness of the 
buyers. German machine production has forged for itself a 
leading roll in international competition with its top level 
accomplishments in technology. More than 20% of the 
exports 
worldwide come from Germany with about 15% each from the 
USA 
and Japan. 
  German machine production also has to thank for its position 
its subcontractors and suppliers who for their part provide 
high-tech products. The newest developments in the automation of 
assembly and handling processes as well as an overview of the 
international state of technology are being offered by the more 
than 200 exhibitors at the approximately 13,000 m[.sup]2[/] 
exhibition area of the Assembly, Handling, Industrial Robot 
Trade Show being held in conjunction with the Hannover Trade 
Show from 20 to 27 April 1994. 
  Running parallel to this, the 25th International Symposium 
on 
Industrial Robots is taking place from 25 to 27 April. Practical 
examples will illustrate diverse and efficiency-increasing 
possibilities for using industrial robots. In addition to 
assembly and handling technology, themes include robot 
components, control systems, image processing, surface 
technology, welding, bonding, and new areas of applications such 
as service robotics.

<F P=106> [Article by HSN, Duesseldorf correspondent: "Machine </F>
Manufacturers Must Learn Orientation to Customers' Needs"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf--The German machine tool 
manufacturers are now undergoing a reorientation process. They 
have to develop machines with fewer technical extra features and 
for a lower price. HANDELSBLATT talked with Prof Tilo Pfeifer, 
business managing director of Werkzeugmaschinenlabor [Machine 
Tool Labor] (WZL) in Aachen about the technical 
consequences. 
  The machine tool industry is still essential to machine and 
plant building, because every type of production is based on use 
of machine tools. Germany was always leader in this field and, 
according to Pfeifer, "has actually not more than to a marginal 
degree relinquished its position to its chief competitor Japan." 
  The medium-size machine tool manufacturers were particularly 
hard hit by the decreasing demand for capital goods. They had 
specialized in machine tools high-tech fabrication processes, 
the first ones factories struck from their purchase lists for 
reasons of the high cost. The crisis in machine tool 
manufacturing is not a problem faced by this industry 
particularly but rather a major a consequence of overproduction 
in all sectors of industry "affecting any enterprise when the 
demand decreases and competition on the market becomes ever 
keener," says Pfeifer. 
<H5>  Machines Too Expensive in Times of Cash Shortage </H5>
  While competing with the Japanese, the machine tool 
manufacturers have in the past let themselves be pushed too hard 
into the specialty niche and left the mass market to the 
Japanese. However, also the Japanese had to realize now that in 
an economic crisis it is not any more the volume they can count 
upon to ensure cost-effective production. These machine tool 
manufacturing enterprises, like all others, now need more 
flexibility in order to more quickly respond to market 
fluctuations. 
  In order to find a way out of the crisis, it is especially 
the German machine tool manufacturers who must learn to orient 
their products to customers' needs. "This is a very important 
prerequisite for as soon as possible regaining a foothold on the 
market," says Pfeifer. Most enterprises do not understand that 
this is also a significant aspect of quality management, a 
strategy much talked about but implemented by only a few 
enterprises. 
  "Furthermore, our abilities and creativity have pushed us 
too 
far in targeting many branches of industry and made us build 
into the machine tools features which, while nice and 
attractive, are of no use to the customer," says Pfeifer in a 
mood of self-criticism. Now, when money for investments is 
scarce, the customer wants only what can be cost effectively 
utilized. The machine tool must be as robust as possible and 
allow for future additions. 
<H5>  Integrated Fabricating Operations Not Flexible Enough </H5>
  During the second half of the 1980's German manufacturers 
had 
more heavily emphasized integrating the operations, with the 
machine tool a component of a computer-controlled system. At 
that time they were convinced that such systems, which a 
computer can fully automate through all stages from planning to 
production, will perform better and respond faster to demand 
fluctuation. "However, this was an illusion," Pfeifer deduces 
from what he now knows. 
  The trend is now back to autonomous units. In this way 
individual production stages acquire more independence. "This 
does not, however, mean a return to manual labor," explains 
Pfeifer. Rather, this should eventually make possible relatively 
quick on-site modification of part programs without prior 
involvement of lengthy planning procedures. The organization of 
these autonomous units will then be controlled not from a 
higher-echelon center but by a self-regulating mechanism. In 
connection with this one is considering chaos organization and 
cooperating fractals. Various catch phrases have already been 
coined, essentially referring to similar concepts of autonomous 
production units. 
  One of the key development regarded by Pfeifer as a 
future-oriented one is, therefore, an autonomous production 
cell: a machine tool which makes efficiently performed functions 
in the production process available to the human operator. In 
this way the attendant who programs the machine tool should have 
available an integrated computer technology which requires only 
that the configuration of machine tool components necessary for 
machining blank parts be entered. "The whole task of assigning 
operations to cutters and planning the procedure is 
automatically performed by processors and controls in the 
background behind the machine tool." 
  A production cell is moreover equipped to perform a broad 
range of monitoring functions: first of all ascertaining that 
all necessary functions are properly included, then inspecting 
and monitoring the tools, and finally monitoring the machining 
process. Many new measuring operations are integrated into 
machine tool for this purpose. 
  The third level of functions to be added concerns the 
machining itself. The aim is to meet the demand that a machine 
tool can be set up so that both turning and milling can be done 
at the same time rather than only classical turning at time, 
this having already been proved to be feasible in several cases. 
As the next interesting feature will be considered combination 
of turning, milling, and drilling in a single setup. Says 
Pfeifer: "I think this will be a further evolving process which 
will indicate how many classical machining operations can be 
rationally combined." 
<H5>  More Functions Integrated in One Machine Tool </H5>
  Beyond that efforts will be made to integrate new 
technologies such as, for instance, laser machining into the 
machine tool. "This idea is not entirely new idea," Pfeifer 
admits, "but still in an early development stage." In this way 
it will become possible to process parts made of hard materials 
by first heating them with a laser beam and then machining them 
while they are hot. 
  Development of future machine tools could lead to a more 
far-reaching than before collaboration with the user industries, 
says Pfeifer: "Colleges could take over the development work for 
future machine designs, work which at this time individual 
medium-size enterprises can financially not afford to do." The 
advantage would be that those enterprises could then integrate 
the innovations into their own products on a step-by-step basis 
without impairing their competitiveness.

<F P=106> [Article by Burkhard Bondel under the rubric "Machine </F>
Building and New Materials. Special. High-Tech": "Machines of 
the Future. Closer Man-Machine Contact. German Manufacturers for 
Years Developed Machines As Their Customers Stood By Watching. 
Now for the First Time the Units Are Operator-Friendly and No 
Longer Shut Out the Know-How of Skilled Operators"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On the broader front research 
institutes and companies have set about long overdue radical 
changes: 

  -  Intuitive input and programming by means of 
graphic symbols, voice and gestures. Aspect GmbH in Norderstedt 
has developed voice recognition for a limited number of machine 
commands. Siemens researchers recently introduced an image 
processing system in which a hand gesture is sufficient to 
control the machine interfaced to the system. 
  -  Process control 
and monitoring. From now on operators will be able to be 
informed directly on the machine's screen about every situation, 
invoke auxiliary functions and intervene in the 
computer-controlled process. Grundig Gildemeister Automation 
GmbH in Hannover has integrated into the control system the 
operator's manual, that up to now has been on paper, so that the 
operator can consult it at the scene of the action. 
  -  Planning. 
Via internetworking with production planning, the machine 
operator already in the near future will be able to decide 
totally on his own when and in which order he wants to make 
individual parts. 

  Not that the industry's mighty have 
accelerated the progress of the change, but former outsiders 
like Oberhachinger Autocon GmbH, R&amp;D Steurung und 
Datentechnik 
[Control and Data Systems Technology] GmbH in 
Mochengladbach, R. &amp; S. Keller GmbH in Wuppertal, Augustin 
&amp; 
Partner GmbH in Neubrandenburg, and IG Metall [Industrial Trade 
Union of Metal Workers]. 
  It starts with seemingly trivial changes that reactivate the 
operator's senses: For instance, in R. &amp; S. Keller's control 
system the screen and operator's panel are to be moved so that 
the operator always has the monitor and machining process 
simultaneously in his field of view. Or that the operator, in 
spite of complete enclosing, can listen into the machines in 
order to monitor acoustically the machining process. Sensors and 
headphones suited for this purpose have been developed at the 
Kassel cluster college's Institute for Ergonomics. 
  Then the operator's closer contact with the machine brings 
about, with revolutionary simple programming and control 
systems, a decisive jump in productivity--for instance, via 
Keller's GKE/CAM or Autocon's Autowop M, that the operator can 
operate in the shop, as well as control systems that enable 
intervention in automatic operations. 
  Up to now programs for machines have had to be written with 
cryptic- appearing commands like G0, L100 or M30. Because each 
control system producer has its own dialect, the mastery of a 
single type of control system really represents a truly 
Herculean task. "It is almost impossible for a single operator 
to be able to operate several machines at the same time," 
complains Herbert Schulz, head of the Institute for 
Manufacturing Technology and Machine Tools at Darmstadt 
Technical College. The consequence: Programs are being created 
in production planning and not by the operator in the shop. "New 
factory models with team work and fractal structures are 
accordingly from the outset doomed to failure," Werner Bauer, 
manager of the European Federation of Fractal Enterprises GmbH 
in Nuremburg, says knowingly. 
  However, Keller and Autocon make do without a program code 
line: For instance, if the operator wants to turn a taper by 
means of GKE/CAM, he chooses the proper graphic symbol from a 
menu and enters the coordinates and machine data. Before the 
machine sets to work, the operator can view the part in three 
dimensions on the screen and run through a simulation of the 
machining process. Outstanding point: So-called postprocessors 
knit together from these entries conventional programs for over 
30 different types of control systems, and these programs can 
then be run online or from diskette. Keller, thinking ahead, is 
adding one other thing to its new CNCplus control system that is 
now coming on the market. Not just that programming on the 
machine is a cinch here, similar to GKE/CAM software. CNCplus 
weds the computer control system to two handwheels that are 
normally used to control conventional machines and are not 
present on any current CNC machine. A lathe or milling machine 
so equipped can now for the first time in the world be run 
manually, semiautomatically and fully automatically. Other 
manufacturers are slowly following suit: Grundig Gildmeister 
Automation has now introduced a control system that upgrades 
conventional machines to semiautomatic CNC machines. 
  The integration, now beginning, of complex computer 
technology and manual operation is urgently necessary. In German 
companies CNC machines live in the shadows with a meager 
15-percent share of the machine inventory. This is the 
operators' revenge: "Because one could hardly operate CNC 
machines, operators stuck with conventional machines," Autocon 
head Hannes W. Politsch says knowingly. This, says the former 
vice president of Deckel, "is a considerable productivity 
disadvantage for the base of Germany vis-a-vis Japan and the 
U.S." 
  User-friendly machines will gain in importance even more in 
the future. Further improved performance is to be expected in 
every type of machine, with high-speed machining, greater 
precision and the use of new materials. On paper anyway. Autocon 
head Politsch says, urging haste, "If a revolution does not 
occur now at the man-machine interface, the advantages will be 
theoretical."

<F P=106> [Article by Andreas Gerlach under the rubric "Machine </F>
Building and New Materials": "Lasers. Urge for Light. German 
World Market Leaders Want to Strengthen Their Position With 
Higher Beam Power"] 
  [Excerpts] [[passage omitted] The laser is more and more 
developing into a wonder weapon in the struggle for 
international competitiveness. And technology for the future is 
one of the few areas in which the Germans are ahead 
technologically. "The Japanese are simply not up to date here," 
asserts Arnold Mayer, chief executive of Optech Consulting in 
Bieseingen and one of the best authorities on the scene. Welding 
and three-dimensional cutting above all are provinces of the 
Germans. In these most important fields of application for 
CO[.sub]2[/] and solid-state lasers they profited strongly 
from the automobile industry's innovation drive during the 80's. 
Today there is hardly a single passenger car maker that does not 
cut, drill, mark or process with the aid of lasers. 
  Most recently small and medium-size companies have also been 
feeling the urge for light, especially in the electrical and 
electronics industry. Point-precision microsurgical intervention 
in integrated circuits is possible with lasers. Precision 
welding and soldering are also no problem for a light beam. 
Added to this is the flexibility of the tool, which enables the 
economical production of even small lots down to single pieces. 
  Still the marketing of laser machines is making no progress. 
"The high investment," says an industry observer, "is at the 
moment not possible for most companies." For better or worse, 
laser manufacturers are tied to the situation in the machine 
building industry, which is only slowly improving. For instance, 
the domestic demand for lasers last year dropped by 20 percent 
to 600 systems. Only exports saved the German laser industry 
from a nose dive. The dynamically growing U.S. market 
represented a substantial share of this. 
  Even Rofin Sinar Laser GmbH, world market leader in the 
manufacture of CO[.sub]2[/] lasers, is "distinctly in the 
red," admits chief executive Samuel Simonsson. After the success 
of the 80's the Siemens subsidiary set its mind totally on 
expansion. Today part of the just recently developed site of a 
passenger car dealer is being used for a warehouse. "Our great 
expectations have not been fulfilled," Simonsson laments. 
  Now management is placing its hopes on a new development, 
the 
so-called diffusion-cooled CO[.sub]2[/] laser. In 
conventional systems large quantities of the gas have to be 
circulated because it gets hot. Part of the carbon dioxide is 
routinely removed in order to reduce the contaminants that 
originate in the process. 
  In the new development the gas is cooled as the laser light 
forms, so that the tremendous technical input for circulation is 
done away with. Because of this the new CO[.sub]2[/] laser is 
smaller and more flexible. Rofin Sinar is presenting at Metav in 
Duesseldorf--the metal machining show that starts on May 3--a 
model having a power of 2 kilowatts. The immediate objective is 
to double this.

  [Text] Fanuc Robotics Deutschland GmbH (Bernhaeuser Str. 
22, 73765 Neuhausen) wants to display a new series of six-axis 
heavy-duty robots at the Hannover Trade Fair. The S-42Oi robots 
have new controls integrated into the robot arm. The company 
claims this will save production space, which is needed for the 
usual control box, and will reduce wiring costs. The new robots 
are said to have better acceleration values and can reduce the 
cycle time by 20 percent. Moreover, further increase in 
availability is also achieved by reducing the number of parts, 
the company reports.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirel Scherer: "Investment in Robotics Still </F>
Declining: Less than 1,000 Robots Installed in France in 
1993"--first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction] 
  [Text] Slightly fewer robots were installed last 
year. The installed base in France consists of 11,795 robots. 
  The number of robots installed in 1993 dropped by only 4 
percent (974 compared with 1,013 in 1992). The total number of 
robots operating in France thus amounts to 11,795 units. This 
gave our fellow magazine ROBAUT and the French Industrial 
Robotics Association (AFRI) an opportunity to announce the first 
upbeat statistics published in a long time. With a warning note, 
however, because sales dropped considerably--by 20 
percent--after manufacturers engaged in a "fierce price and 
discount battle." Small to mid-size industries and firms 
continued to invest in these automation means, and 407 robots 
were installed in their plants in 1993. This is due to the sharp 
fall of robot prices (11 percent in 1993 alone). 
  When the automobile industry sneezes, robotics catches cold: 
the depressed market confirmed the saying. For the first time 
since these statistics are computed, automobile manufacturers 
and their subcontractors accounted for less than 50 percent of 
the market (only 46 percent). There is some hope, however. 
Several industries claim that they need more robots. The 
agrifood industry, for instance, with a 36-percent growth rate 
(by number of units), or the electric/electronics industry with 
+6 percent, or again the glass/ceramic industry which increased 
its purchases fourfold, from 7 to 29 units. 
  From a technical point of view, four-axis robots and robots 
with more than six axes were the most popular with users. The 
same was true of robots with Cartesian, spherical, and parallel 
axes. Over two thirds of the robots installed in 1993 handle 
loads weighing less than 60 kg. Parts handling, remains a major 
robot application, although it was hit hard. That was not the 
case of pallettization and packaging, a sector which 
considerably increased its use of robots, while machine 
loading/unloading was far from achieving the same score as in 
1992 (it declined by about 50 percent). The feeding of plastics 
injection-molding machines made a remarkable leap. On the other 
hand, welding (arc welding as well as spot welding) no longer 
pays: the number of robots installed is in marked decline. As 
for education and research, the number of robots they use 
increased threefold.

<F P=106> [Article by Laurence Girard: "How Snecma Is Computerizing </F>
Its Methods Engineering Department"] 
  [Text] Its object is to improve the drawing up, 
management, and circulation of technical documentation. All 
stages of the engine parts manufacturing process will be 
described by the engineers at workstations. These descriptions 
will be added to a shared database. In due time, the workers 
will consult the workshop instructions on screens. 
  The Snecma aircraft-engine parts manufacturing "script" is 
handwritten by the methods engineering department's 160 
engineers. It describes all the operations to be 
performed--machining, milling, stamping, etc.--at each stage of 
the manufacturing process, and is accompanied by schematics 
showing the evolution of the parts. This "movie" will soon be 
displayed on workstation screens. At any rate, this is one of 
the objectives of the Spirit project that is under way at 
Snecma's Corbeil site, which employs 4,400 persons, and whose 
main activity is the fabrication of parts and subassemblies for 
civil and military aircraft engines. 
  This project, begun in 1990, is part of the steps being 
taken 
toward computerizing the methods engineering stages. Of the 
three stages involving considerable work by the methods 
engineers, the first and the last have already been 
computerized. The first consists of defining the major 
production steps of a new product line. This takes place prior 
to launching the manufacturing process. The second methods 
engineering stage converts each production step into workshop 
instructions addressed to the shopworkers. The third stage 
serves to define the list of tool setups and quality checks that 
are indispensable to the carrying out of each instruction. The 
major production steps and the tool lists are already available 
in the data base mode named Omega. Only the drawing up of the 
instructions is still essentially a manual operation. 
  These instructions represent a considerable volume of paper. 
Suffice it to imagine: Snecma's Corbeil site holds the reference 
documentation on 8,000 parts. This represents 8,000 
manufacturing operations. And each operation can represent as 
many as 15 workshop instructions, each of which entails several 
pages of description. In all, a stack of over 500,000 pages! To 
boot, this documentation must be kept for some 30-odd years. 
"This keeping and updating of documents was being done very 
poorly," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon, who heads the Spirit 
project, the main objectives of which are to improve the 
traceability of the documents, reduce the cycles involved in the 
creating of production data, and avoid the problem of retrieval 
of documents. 
  For the moment, it is yet too early to know if these 
objectives will be fully attained. The project is still in 
midstream. After having "polished up" the document display 
formats so as to rule out deviations stemming from personalized 
touches, 1991 was the year of technical choices. Since two 
thirds of the documents consist of drawings, and one third of 
text, a tool had to be found to manipulate both. "We did not 
want to produce sophisticated documentation, but simply 
technical files. We had before us CAP (computer-assisted 
production) tools oriented mainly toward text and display, and 
CAD (computer-aided design) tools oriented more toward 
drafting." Finally, Jean-Pierre Chavanon chose CimLinc, a 
composite tool distributed in France by Intelligent Document. It 
provides CAP and CAD capabilities simultaneously. The 
application, based on CimLinc, is being developed in-house. "We 
are designing it, to the extent possible, with the engineers who 
will be using it, and we are trying to preserve their working 
methods," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon. Since the middle of last 
year, some 20 workstations have been installed, and 60 persons 
trained. By the end of next year, 60 workstations are expected 
to be available. 
  Spirit calls for each engineer to be equipped with a Sun 
workstation. He will retrieve the drawings created previously 
with Catia software, detail them, and annotate them. The 
structure of the document will be automatically updated. He will 
then draw up the workshop instructions, remarks, etc. These 
instruction documents are not drafted in a single go. Several 
persons lend a hand. Some methods engineers are generalists; 
they are responsible for the part as a whole. But they call upon 
specialists--welding specialists, for example, specialists in 
surface treatment, and all other techniques--to fine-tune the 
document. As of now, these documents, on paper, circulate 
hand-to-hand among the engineers, with all the problems of 
updating and the responsibilities this procedure entails. With 
Spirit, each person, working at his or her workstation, will 
have access at all times to the document, which will be stored 
in the shared database. All modifications will be recorded 
together with the name of the specialist who has made the 
modification. 
  New manufacturing operations are already being carried out 
with this new system. The database will be added to 
progressively. Whatever is on paper will stay on paper, of 
course. The paper files and the division storerooms, which have 
the job of duplicating the documents and distributing them 
within the workshop, will still be around for some time to come, 
although the idea for the time being is to short-circuit the 
division storerooms progressively by distributing the documents 
that are still in paper form directly to the manufacturing 
stations. Under the new system, each shopworker will make a 
printout of the documents that are of interest to him or her, 
and in due time will perhaps access the screen directly for 
workshop instructions. This second phase of the project has been 
taken in hand by Snecma's Gennevilliers site. A natural course 
of events, given that Gennevilliers has decided to adopt what 
has already been achieved at the Corbeil site. There is no point 
in duplicating studies at a time when the aeronautical market is 
hurting badly. And the more so considering that the project as a 
whole is costing around 9 million French francs [Fr]. 
<H5>  Snecma: 13,800 Persons, 6 Main Sites </H5>
  Snecma's 1991 revenue totaled Fr14.5 billion, approximately 
80 percent of which was generated by exports. Its 13,800 
employees are distributed over six main sites. Its Gennevilliers 
site manufactures forged and cast parts. Its Evry-Corbeil 
center, equipped with 1,500 machines, manufactures civil and 
military aircraft engine parts and subassemblies. New engines 
are designed and tested at the Melun-Villaroche site. Snecma's 
highly automated Creusot plant produces the turbine disks. 
Elecma Suresnes houses Snecma's electronics division. And 
Snecma's Istres site is its flight test center.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephane Farni: "Sextant Avionique Recovering </F>
Lost Time"] 
  [Text] Running behind its competitors, Sextant 
Avionique is putting on an extra spurt to improve its 
flexibility. 
  A general mobilization is under way at Sextant Avionique, 
Thomson's and Aerospatiale's specialized subsidiary. The 
just-in-time method of production, launched around the beginning 
of 1992 in a pilot workshop at its Bordeaux plant, will be 
generalized this year at the group's five main sites: Bourdeaux, 
Chatellerault, Valence, Velizy, and Vendome. With the 
aeronautics industry currently in a slump, the change will not 
be all that easy to manage. Sextant's revenue dropped 10 percent 
in 1993, to 4.9 billion French francs [Fr], versus Fr5.4 billion 
in 1992. 
  After getting off to a late start and trailing behind its 
American competitors, Sextant is bent on recovering lost time. 
For, looking beyond the current crisis, the pressure being 
exerted by clients, aircraft manufacturers, and airline 
companies, is mounting. Boeing and Airbus have both placed 
priorities on reducing production cycles. "Until now," says 
Francis Lefebvre, the company's industrial manager, "these 
cycles have been running on the order of around one year at 
Sextant. Today, our clients are demanding a normal turnaround 
time of one month. In other words, they are demanding that in 
the normal course of activity we be capable of modulating our 
production cycle within a maximum delivery time of one month." 
  During 1993, these external constraints were compounded by 
the instituting of a new organization. Five market-oriented 
divisions (civil avionics, military avionics, helicopter 
avionics and instruments, space, and automatic testing) have 
replaced the former product-oriented divisions. The company's 
industrial sites, which until then had been managed by a central 
industrial head office, have been placed under the new 
divisions. Velizy, for example, which manufactures all the 
flight computers, has taken over the civil avionics division. 
Bordeaux, which specializes in displays, has become the seat of 
the military avionics division. At the same time, each plant can 
become the supplier (or the client) of the others. 
  The introduction of the just-in-time method has followed a 
classic format. The first stage is the creation of individual 
product lines. At Velizy, the Airbus A 320 computer line began 
operating in February. Three others will follow: A 300-A 310 
computers, A 330-A 340 computers, and military computers. 
Heretofore, these different products have been processed in a 
single workshop. The operation was made all the more complex by 
the existence of several types of computers for each model of 
Airbus (eight for the A 320), with a few hundred of each being 
produced each year (Sextant manufactures a total of 22,000 
pieces of equipment and sensors per year). The system was 
identical at Bordeaux, with four lines of displays (the monitor 
screens that equip the cockpits), three for the Airbus, one for 
military planes. The second stage is the putting in place of the 
kanban system in the workshops. Sextant has contracted for the 
services of a specialist, Yves Milles, manager of the Gopal 
company, who for 10 years exercised his talents in the workshops 
of the PSA [Peugeot Corporation]. His credo: There is no need to 
upset the manufacturing process in order for kanban to yield its 
results. The important thing is to not halt production because 
of a contingency. Hence the need to make the process fail-safe, 
whether that process be related to supplies, staff, or 
production capacity. Thus, Yves Milles has developed circular 
kanban panels that provide maximum visibility and display the 
status of manufacturing orders. "The more contingencies you 
have, the more interested you are in tying the flow of 
information to the physical flow of the process. That interest 
is what kanban is all about," he sums up. 
  The method was first tested at Bordeaux in a pilot plant 
that 
manufactures electric power supplies. The results speak for 
themselves with, among other things, a production cycle divided 
by eight. Kanban is now taking over at Sextant's other plants. 
At Velizy, on the A 320 computers line, the objective is to 
reduce the production cycle from nine months to three or four. 
"The books will reflect the economies beginning in 1995," says 
Francis Lefebvre. Something to look forward to while awaiting 
the recovery of the aeronautics market.

<F P=106> [Article by BH: "Luminous Silicon From Airy Crystals"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt--By means of supercritical liquid 
extraction, British scientists have extracted a highly porous 
form of silicon which emits visible light. The aerocrystals are 
stable and should therefore be suitable as material for optical 
electronics. 
  Two years ago the group around Leigh Canham at DRA Malvern 
in 
Worcester (WR14 3PS, Great Britain) produced luminescent silicon 
crystals for the first time. At the time the researchers used an 
electrochemical etching method and obtained a porous material 
which consisted of 90-percent air. 
  In order to make the aerogels even lighter and improve their 
luminescent properties, the British scientists have now added 
another step to the procedure. The ethanol which remained in the 
pores of the porous silicon layers, obtained by means of an 
electrochemical process, was slowly replaced under pressure by 
adding liquid carbon dioxide. 
  With increasing pressure and higher temperature the pores in 
the silicon layer expanded and finally yielded an aerogel that 
consisted of more than 95-percent air. Until now the method of 
supercritical drying had been applied primarily in the 
production of porous ceramics, but not yet in silicon technology. 
  The airy silicon layers could, as their inventors write in 
the British scientific journal NATURE (vol 368, p 133), lead to 
dramatic improvements in the development of optoelectronic 
materials.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Manganese Incorporated in Rod-Like </F>
Molecule Improves the Properties"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--British chemists have succeeded in 
incorporating manganese in a rod-like molecule that has the 
properties of a liquid crystal. Reportedly, the technique can 
also be applied to other metals. Consequently, the NEW SCIENTIST 
reports (No. 1917, p. 18, 1994), in future a number of new 
liquid crystals could be created with interesting properties, 
as, for example, coloration. 
  The incorporation of metals in liquid crystals can improve 
their properties. The crystals, reportedly, become more stable 
because of their greater polarizability. Polarizability is the 
ability to change the electronic structure into electrical 
fields. In addition, displays incorporating such liquid crystals 
are more legible because the metals also alter the optical 
properties. 
  Since metals are prone toward coloration, liquid crystal 
displays of various colors could also be produced without the 
need of expensive color filters. Finally, the metals could also 
make the displays respond to magnetic and electrical switching, 
since almost all metals react to external magnetic fields. 
  Because of the special form a molecule must have to form a 
liquid crystal, it has so far only been possible to incorporate 
a handful of metals in liquid crystals. The molecule must be 
long and, above all, flat. But most metals prefer tetrahedron- 
or octahedron-structured environments. Only a very few, as, for 
example, platinum, nickel, and copper, accept planar structures. 
  Duncan Bruce and Xiao-Hua Liu of Sheffield University 
(Center 
of Molecular Materials, Department of Chemistry, Sheffield, UK 
S3 7HF) have succeeded in producing a molecule that contains 
octahedron-bound manganese. The metal atom is introduced 
somewhat to the side in about the middle of the long rod-like 
molecule so as not to disrupt the formation of a liquid 
crystalline phase. 
  The molecule is a particle in which the structural elements 
are linked together in a chain-like manner. There are long 
hydrocarbon groups at the ends; in the middle there are ester 
bonds and a so-called imino group by means of which the 
manganese atom is bound. The scientists report in the journal of 
the Chemical Society, CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS (No. 6, p. 729, 
1994) that the metal also has four additional carbonyl groups 
that hold the complex together.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenther Ludvik: "Optical Terminal"] </F>
  [Text] A cosmic data transfer line for optical 
communication by means of lasers is to have its world premiere 
in 1997. Carl Zeiss Jena is part of the development. 
  The factory sale of reflecting telescopes was almost a 
matter 
of routine in Jena. But it was different for the 13th 1-meter 
reflecting telescope--not only because the signing of the 
contract in 1991 "coincided with the founding of the Carl Zeiss 
Jena GmbH company," as managing director Dr. Elk Littow recalls, 
but because it also meant the entrance of the Jena group into a 
new generation of technology. 
  With this telescope Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH is supplying the 
optical ground station for SILEX, the semiconductor 
intersatellite link experiment of the ESA. It is intended to 
create a prototype system for optical data transfer between 
satellites. By the end of 1995 the first ground station in 
Europe will be constructed in the mountains of the Spanish 
island of Teneriffe at a height of 2,500 m. It can produce a 
data link from the ground to a geostationary satellite using 
optical frequencies. 
  For ESA program director Anthony Dickinson, SILEX is an 
important step for the further development of commercial space 
travel. "No civilian space communications system has previously 
used laser light as a data link or makes use of the advantages, 
such as significantly higher data transfer capacity, good 
protection from interference and surveillance, and extension of 
the available frequency range for information transmittal." 
  This is becoming increasingly important. After all, the 
radio 
frequencies available in space have been heavily taxed. At the 
same time, power demands and size of facilities would be 
reduced, so that deployment on small satellites becomes a 
possibility. 
  Zeiss's participation in this innovation came just in time 
to 
save the 13th telescope and the attached housing with a diameter 
of 12.5 meters from landing on the scrapheap. The system had 
really been developed for astronomical observations and intended 
for the USSR. The individual components had already been 
completed, but the Russians could not purchase the telescope 
because of lack of cash. 
  A visit from the general director of the German Agency for 
Space Affairs (DARA), Jan-Baldem Mennicken, came to the rescue. 
The Thuringians were attentive to the fact that the European 
Space Agency (ESA) wanted to grant equal opportunity to 
companies and institutions in the new Federal Laender in their 
projects. The Jena group put this offer to the test by offering 
their system for the SILEX experiment. They redesigned the 
equipment under contract to DARA and fitted it with the most 
modern drives and control systems. 
  For its assignment had changed. In the SILEX experiment a 
new 
technological ESA data satellite, the geostationary ARTEMIS 
satellite, will be deployed. It receives data by means of 
classical microwave staellite transmission. These will be 
transmitted from the SILEX laser-optics communications system to 
the telescope. 
  In tests, the ground station with the Zeiss telescope is to 
simulate a future user satellite. The first real satellite which 
is to use the laser-optics terminal of ARTEMIS will be the 
French earth observation satellite SPOT-4. Generally it can only 
transmit imaging data to the next ground station for no longer 
than 10 minutes from its orbit at an altitude of 700 km. 
  This means loss of time: data carriers from stations 
overseas 
must be transported great distances for evaluation. SILEX, on 
the other hand, will always make uninterrupted links between 
SPOT-4 and its control center in Toulouse possible, as long as 
the satellite is within range of ARTEMIS, located 36,000 km 
above the equator. The data relay link to ARTEMIS is maintained 
when SPOT-4 flies over more than half of the land surfaces on 
earth. 
  The data rate of SILEX is 50 Mbits per second. ARTEMIS 
distributes the data received from observation satellites 
directly to users in Europe. 
  For this purpose ARTEMIS and SPOT-4 are equipped with 25-cm 
diameter telescopes for sending and receiving. These are 
supplied by Jena's former rival and current project partner, 
Carl Zeiss Oberkochen. Mirrors and structural telescope parts 
are not manufactured from the lightweight material graphite 
epoxy, but because of the required accuracy in measurement they 
are made of Zerodur from Schott, which has no thermal expansion. 
  DARA managing director Prof. Heinz Stoewer sees in SILEX--at 
present the only advanced civilian project in optic satellite 
communications--new dimensions for the communications industry, 
"one of the most important branches of the economy for the 
future." He says that Germany cannot afford to do without such 
high technology or to rest content with vanishingly small market 
shares in the long run. The civilian market for satellite 
communications will triple in the next 10 years, from $10 
billion to $30 billion. "German industrial firms are important 
sources of innovation. There is the chance for them to achieve a 
leading position in this area." 
  The Zeiss people in Oberkochen, who have sufficiently proved 
their competence in space projects with the development and 
manufacture of the optics for the X-ray astronomy Rosat 
satellites, are involved. The Jena group, too, has something to 
offer: the former collective combine was included in important 
Soviet space travel projects. Developments like the 
multispectrum camera in the 70's and astronavigation systems for 
satellites in the 80's are among their achievements. 
  Now the DARA contract was "enormously important for the area 
of astronomical equipment which is currently being 
restructured." Along with the new arrangement in the Zeiss 
Group, Jena has also assumed corporate responsibility for this 
systems area.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Optical Thin Films: CEA/REOSC </F>
Optical Licensing Agreement"] 
  [Text] Paris--The French company REOSC Optique [Optical 
Research and Studies and Allied Sciences] will industrialize a 
process developed by the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA) 
directorate of military applications to produce optical 
anti-reflection or high-reflectivity thin film deposits. 
  On 24 February, the CEA announced that the licensing 
agreement that was just signed will enable REOSC to use this 
"sol-gel" process to make scientific optical components and 
anti-reflection glass panes, especially to protect art works. 
The technique was developed at the Limeil-Valenton center in 
connection with research on military power lasers and is covered 
by several patents; it consists in depositing by capillarity 
high-performance thin films, a few microns thick. 
  The "sol-gel" process uses submicron particles of oxides or 
fluorides in an alcohol- or water-based medium. After 
evaporation of the solvent, these particles form a brittle 
porous optical film, but one of the anti-reflection coatings, 
Flucosil, is a dense abrasion-resistant and water-repellent 
composite film. 
  The process works at ordinary temperatures (around 120xC) 
and 
even at room temperature, so that it can be applied to mineral 
or plastic media. According to the CEA, it can also treat large 
areas at very competitive prices. 
  A subsidiary of the French aircraft equipment manufacturer 
SFIM-Industries [Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company], 
REOSC Optique is a world-renowned specialist of high-precision 
optics for satellites such as Spot. It is currently grinding the 
first eight-meter diameter mirror of the Very Large Telescope 
(VLT) that will be installed at the European Southern 
Observatory (ESO), on top of Cerro Paranal, in Chile.

<F P=106> [Article by Michel Vilnat: "Welding: Diamond To Polarize </F>
Laser Beams"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction" 
  [Text] Synthetic diamond membranes that are excellent 
polarizing filters enhance the quality of laser utilization. 
  In the near future, a new technology will become available 
to 
users of CO[.sub]2[/] lasers, to improve welding quality or 
cutting precision. They will owe it to ultrathin 
synthetic-diamond membranes developed by a university team. In 
fact, researchers at the Paris-Nord university at Villetaneuse 
just showed that a stack of several of these membranes would 
form a remarkable polarizing filter perfectly suitable for 
high-power lasers. 
<H5>  A Veritable "Cross" </H5>
  A laser beam consists of light waves associated with an 
electric field perpendicular to the propagation axis. The 
electric field possesses one horizontal and one vertical 
component. Polarization consists in favoring one of the 
components. 
  Until now, multikilowatt-laser users would make do with 
bulky 
and hard-to-adjust kaleidoscopes to mix polarizations in a 
random manner and achieve a consistent average effect. 
  The invention of this polarizing membrane filter is the 
result of a "cross" between two basic research branches. At the 
Paris-Nord university at Villetaneuse, two teams work a few 
hundred meters from each other, in entirely different fields. 
First, the team headed by Alix Gicquel, researcher at the 
materials engineering and high-pressure laboratory, an expert in 
synthetic diamond deposition; second, Christian Chardonnet, 
researcher at the Villetaneuse laser physics laboratory of the 
CNRS [National Center for Scientific Research], a specialist of 
advanced molecular research. 
  After hearing about Alix Gicquel's team's research on 
diamond 
membranes, Christian Chardonnet thought of testing them with the 
ultra-stable CO[.sub]2[/] lasers that are routinely used in 
his laboratory. Results were quick to follow. Compared with 
germanium filters, which until now were considered as the ne 
plus ultra of polarizing filters, the new system, consisting of 
six membranes, is 100 times more efficient. Better still, the 
1-micron thick diamond film does not bend the laser beam. A 
realignment device is no longer needed. "The excellent thermal 
conductivity characteristics of diamond, 20 times better than 
those of copper, lead us to expect a particularly high 
permissible power threshold," Christian Chardonnet indicated. 
Tests should soon be made on a multikilowatt CO[.sub]2[/] 
laser. So far, only zinc selenide lenses can withstand powers 
greater than 100 watt, but exceeding 1 kilowatt is out of the 
question. Besides, they are 1,000 times less efficient. 
  Christian Chardonnet's polarizing filter is not suitable 
just 
for CO[.sub]2[/] lasers. A slight thickness modification and 
an improvement in the roughness of the diamond window would make 
it possible to use the device for YAG [yttrium-aluminum garnet] 
lasers. A promising market! At the same time, diamond membranes 
can also protect infrared camera lenses. CO[.sub]2[/] laser 
beams, which have a wavelength of 10.6 microns, will be stopped 
by a set of crossed slats, while perfect transparency will be 
retained for wavelengths of 3 to 5 microns, the preferred range 
of these instruments. 
<H5>  The Secret of Diamond Filter Manufacture </H5>
  Making a 1-micron thick diamond membrane involves two 
stages. 
The synthetic diamond coating is deposited on a silicon plate, 
the central part of which is then chemically dissolved to leave 
only the diamond film. The team headed by Alix Gicquel, research 
at the materials engineering and high-pressure laboratory of the 
Paris-Nord university, at Villetaneuse, uses the microwave-aided 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to deposit the synthetic 
diamond film. The film is obtained from a gas mixture consisting 
of 99 percent hydrogen and 1 percent gaseous hydrocarbons. The 
gases are decomposed by an uptake of energy and form a plasma 
that contains mostly atomic hydrogen and hydrocarbon molecules. 
The latter contribute carbon, while hydrogen promotes the growth 
of diamond crystals and prevents the formation of graphite, 
which would pollute the film. To obtain very thin films, experts 
try to increase the number of crystals. One solution consists in 
immersing the substrate in an ultrasonically agitated bath 
containing fine diamond particles before going on to the 
chemical deposition stage.

<F P=106> [Article by Odile Esposito: "A Gyrometer on a Silicon Chip"] </F>
  [Text] LETI [Laboratory for Electronics and Data 
Processing Technology], PSA [Peugeot S.A.], and Sextant 
Avionique are currently developing a fully integrated optical 
gyrometer on a silicon chip a few centimeters on a side. Its 
potential applications are many, in the automobile industry as 
well as avionics. 
  The guidance of vehicles, whether they be robots, rockets, 
planes, missiles, or simply automobiles, has become a topic of 
research of major interest to industrialists. Determination of 
the vehicle's trajectory necessitates the use of an instrument 
that measures speed of rotation, namely, the gyrometer. The 
problem is to design and build a gyrometer that is at one and 
the same time reliable, economical, small, and as easily 
integrated into an automobile as any ordinary electronic 
component. The CEA [Atomic Energy Commission]-LETI integrated 
optics laboratory at Grenoble has been working on this problem 
for the past several years, in cooperation with PSA and Sextant 
Avionique. After having demonstrated the feasibility of 
integrating such a component on a silicon substrate, they have 
now received financing in the amount of 11 million French francs 
[Fr] from the Ministry of Research and Higher Education, under 
the Technological Leap program, to develop the device and 
prepare its industrialization. 
  "The use of optics for gyrometers is now very old," says 
Patrick Mottier, head of this LETI laboratory. "It has been used 
in the laser and fiber-optic gyrometers developed by firms such 
as Thomson and Photonetics." But use of these very costly 
devices (around Fr10,000 for the gyrometers used in some 
Japanese cars) is essentially confined to rockets, submarines, 
and satellites. With the advances being made in integrated 
optics--enabling the production of conventional components 
(lenses, mirrors, separators, etc) on a glass or silicon 
substrate--the idea of developing an integrated optical 
gyrometer has made way rapidly. 
<H5>  Many Difficulties Need Surmounting </H5>
  The principle of this device rests on what opticians call 
the 
Sagnac effect: A light guide, wound spirally, is fed at both 
ends by one and the same light source, a laser diode. The 
resulting two light beams circulating in opposite directions 
produce interferences, and, as this light loop rotates, the 
difference in level of interference is linked directly to the 
speed of rotation. In fiber-optic gyrometers, the light guide 
consists of an optical fiber several thousand meters long, wound 
in a loop some 10 centimeters in diameter. 
  In the device developed by LETI, the optical fiber is 
replaced by a light guide on silicon, 80 centimeters long and 3 
centimeters in diameter. "To lower production costs and attain 
components costing a few tens of French francs, we would like to 
reduce the size of this loop," says Patrick Mottier. "But we are 
limited by propagation loss along the ring." The principal 
drawback of these integrated optical devices is in fact their 
optical loss, which is 10,000 times that of fiber types. If the 
circuit is too long, the signal is greatly attenuated and 
becomes impossible to detect! 
<H5>  Reducing Manufacturing Costs </H5>
  While LETI has contributed its components-integration 
skills, 
PSA and Sextant have worked mainly on the signal processing. The 
two firms do not by any means have the same philosophy in this 
venture. "PSA approaches it as a potential user. Sextant, on the 
other hand, wants to master the technology of producing these 
optical circuits," says Patrick Mottier. Be that as it may, the 
three partners, as of now, are bent on improving the prototype 
they have developed. Their objectives: reduction of optical 
losses, choice of a better source and the optimal frequency, and 
above all, lowering of the eventual manufacturing cost. The 
outlook: many long months of work!

<F P=106> [Article: "Cost-Effective Optoelectric Chips"; Subhead: </F>
"Brits Improve Process for Production of Porous Silicon"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Extremely porous crystalline silicon can 
be used in circuits to emit light in the visible spectrum range. 
This phenomenon, discovered in 1991 by British scientist Leigh 
Canham, enables production of new, cost-effective opto-electric 
chips for communications engineering. To fabricate the highly 
porous silicon Canham employed a then special electro-chemical 
caustic technique that since then has turned out to be hard to 
control. He has now perfected a modified production technique 
that can be better controlled and directed. 
  This new technique makes use of a supercritical fluid and is 
characterized as "supercritical drying." It results in the 
ability to remove the fluid used to create the pores in the 
supercritical state without being able, in the process, to 
result in the development of addition-reaction films by the 
fluid with the silicon. Additionally, no shrinkage phenomena 
surface, so that the size and structure of the pores remain 
fully intact. 
  The special drying technique has been used so far for the 
production of porous solids that likewise display extremely high 
porosity. Even in the case of silicon it creates the desired 
porosity by nearly more than 95 percent of the silicon's volume. 
Preliminary sample materials, produced still using laboratory 
techniques, reveal an extremely uniform crystalline structure of 
columnar crystals that guarantee high solidity. Porous silicon 
is especially advantageous since it is considerably cheaper to 
produce than film-like gallium arsenide structures that have 
been used until now for experimental optoelectronic circuits.

  [Text] Enschede--The Mesa Institute of the Technical 
University [of Enschede] by chance discovered bacteria that can 
etch chips. The research group Biosensors has been 
experimenting for quite some time with silicon sensors on which 
a layer of biologically active material was applied as a 
breeding gound for enzymes and bacteria. By accident the 
bacteria of the strain Coli Silica Etcherca appeared to affect 
the silicon material. This property is now being used to etch 
chips. The biological material is kept on the "right track" by 
applying lethal chemicals on the interfaces. Meanwhile, 
miniature microphones have been manufactured using this new 
method.

<F P=106> ["E.F." report: "14-Inch Color LCD Screen Prototype in </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart/Hannover--The technology developed in the 
screen-technology laboratory of Stuttgart University could, 
according to its inventor Jens Glueck, solve the current problem 
of low luminosity efficiency and the resulting high prices of 
active-matrix LCD screens. The new technology uses a 
potentially less expensive transistor matrix manufacturing 
process with four masking techniques as opposed to five or six 
for the Japanese products currently available on the market, 
while offering a comparable image quality. Again according to 
Jens Glueck, the quality would be better than that obtained with 
the two-stage masking process developed by Planecran, a 
technique that is now owned by Flat Panel Displays: "Unlike the 
Planecran approach, each pixel has its own storage capacitor. 
We have optimized the pixel design to obtain an aperture ratio 
of 60 percent and thus ensure greater brightness." The 
feasibility of the technology has recently been proven with the 
presentation of the first 14-inch color prototypes. These 
screens, with a resolution of 575 x 696 color pixels, compatible 
with video refresh rates, are not completely bug-free, however. 
Jens Glueck said: "These faults do not arise from the 
technology itself, and can be eliminated by extra research on 
peripheral devices, command circuit connections, etc." In 
addition, negotiations are underway between Stuttgart University 
and IBM which envisages launching a project for the 
industrialization of the process by its German subsidiary. 
Negotiations are in particular centered on the financing of the 
project and the possible introduction of additional partners. 
As a result, the initial screens produced using this technology 
will probably not be commercially available for another two to 
three years. 
  The technology patented by Jens Glueck is of the inverse 
grid 
type, but is simpler than conventional inverse grid technology. 
The first masking stage consists of depositing a 200 mm-thick 
layer of chromium which is then etched to produce the lines and 
lower electrodes of the storage capacitors. Four layers are 
then deposited: the grid insulator (SiNx); the undoped 
semiconductor material (noncrystalline hydrogenated silicon, 
a-Si:H); the n+ doped semiconductor material (n+ -a-Si:H) for 
the drain and source electrodes; and an aluminum/chromium alloy 
(Cr/Al/Cr) for metallization. The absence of any intermediate 
etching eliminates the losses in efficiency usually experienced 
with the inverse grid process. This method moreover protects 
column metallization and prevents short-circuiting at the 
row/column cross-over points. 
<H5>  End-of-Etching Control Without a "Blocker" </H5>
  The second masking stage consists of simultaneously etching 
the metallization and the doped semiconductor to create the 
columns, drain/source electrodes, and the upper capacitor 
electrodes, while carefully controlling the optical emission of 
the etching source (CF402 etching plasma) to avoid 
"over-etching" which would attack the layer of undoped 
semiconductor (this problem is avoided in five or six-stage 
masking techniques by using an etching "blocker" which requires 
an additional masking stage). The last two masking stages 
consist of etching the undoped semiconductor to create the 
pixel, and then depositing and etching the ITO (indium tin 
oxide) layer to make the electrodes. This layer serves both as 
an extra metallization layer and a patch for broken columns.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Heinrich Kurz, director of the </F>
Institute of Semiconductor Technology, Aachen Technical College, 
by Jeanne Rubner; place and date not given: "Is The JESSI 
[Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative] Project A 
Failure?"] 
  [Text] 
  [Rubner] The federal research minister recently spoke 
positively about the European microelectronics project JESSI 
[Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative]. But critics 
speak of window dressing. As a researcher who was involved in 
JESSI, how do you see it? 
  [Kurz] It is more than window dressing, but we must take 
into 
consideration that it was not the federal minister who landed us 
in JESSI. JESSI is, so to speak, an old boys' network, and a 
minister who is a layman is taken in by the window dressing. 
The fact is, there is a vast discrepancy between the claims and 
the results. None of JESSI's big "flag ships" has got off the 
ground. On the contrary, the fleet has almost sunk already. 
  [Rubner] Can you tell us what the project's most important 
flag ships were? 
  [Kurz] Apart from the clusters, the joint projects in 
manufacturing technology, which were also not particularly 
successful, there are five applications flag ships. These are: 
high resolution television, digital broadcasting, broadband 
communications, mobile radio, and safety electronics for 
automobiles. The high resolution television project has just 
gone under, mobile radio is firmly in the hands of firms that 
were not sponsored by JESSI. The problem is that there were 
several changes of strategy. Industry regarded JESSI as a 
sponsorship program for itself in which firms need not have 
clear objectives. 
  [Rubner] Yet the European semiconductor industry still has 
only a small share of the world market. Surely more must have 
gone wrong than just a change of strategy? 
  [Kurz] The failings go back 15 or 20 years. The five-year 
program running until 1996 has at best delayed Europe's 
withdrawal from the world market. Initially, JESSI was not 
intended to be a program for capturing the market, but to create 
the technological basis for the microelectronics industry. Only 
later were substantial parts of a basic program abandoned to 
press ahead with applications. 
  [Rubner] Applications are not necessarily bad. Where did 
JESSI go wrong? 
  [Kurz] If firms are always looking out of the corner of 
their eye for more competent partners outside of JESSI, there is 
bound to be failure in applications. 
  [Rubner] With 150 firms involved, does that not entail an 
enormous amount of bureaucracy? 
  [Kurz] Here we have Europe's old complaint again. The money 
that was spent on administration could have been put into basic 
research or given directly to competent firms without them 
having to find a pseudo-common objective. But all European 
projects have this problem. 
  [Rubner] Among others, a European CAD [computer-aided 
design] software program is cited as a successful JESSI project. 
Why was it worth spending millions on it? 
  [Kurz] I don't understand it at all. But JESSI sets great 
store by the project partners talking to each other. It would 
of course have been more honest if JESSI had been called a 
political integration program from the start. 
  [Rubner] Have there been technically good results? 
  [Kurz] Yes, isolated ones in the areas of the clusters I 
mentioned. But the question remains whether the progress was 
not rather the result of ideas from the USA or Japan, or from 
JESSI. By the way, one particular misjudgment was X-ray 
lithography. 
  [Rubner] But most experts didn't expect it would be possible 
to make the 64 megabit chip without X-ray lithography. 
  [Kurz] That isn't the case. There are a lot of predictions 
about how far optical lithography will go. They were still 
talking about X-ray lithography in JESSI when the Japanese were 
already announcing the 64-megabit chip with optical processes. 
  [Rubner] JESSI runs out in 1996. What ought to come then? 
  [Kurz] Certainly not a repetition. We already know how 
JESSI will end. The people with political responsibility should 
already be setting up an independent commission of enquiry so 
that competent experts can talk about the next stage. The most 
important questions are: What is a long-term research strategy? 
What is the correct form of involvement for the universities, 
Fraunhofer Institutes and others? We need new methods to better 
develop Europe's existing potential. There should at all events 
be greater [financial] support for basic research, particularly 
in the direction of automatic mini labs, that is small factories 
in which special chips, Asics [application-specific integrated 
circuits] for short, are made. Funding should be awarded solely 
according to scientific and technical criteria -- not like in 
JESSI, where industry acted like a society for self-advancement 
in deciding who would get money.

  [Text] Experts credit to microsystem technology no 
less of a key position than to microelectronics. Germany is 
taking a lead with its research facilities, and great 
possibilities are also opening up for industry. Small and 
medium-sized companies, however, are still experiencing serious 
problems in developing marketable products. 
  "Microsystem technology constitutes an expansion of 
microelectronics," Prof. Dr. Anton Heuberger emphasized at the 
presentation of the BMFT's [Federal Ministry of Research and 
Technology] promotional program "Microsystem Technology" on 
February 18th in Sankt Augustin, "which will achieve a key 
importance still in this century similar to that of 
microelectronics today." The director of the Berlin Fraunhofer 
Institute for Silicon Technology (ISiT) is confident that this 
key technology which has the goal of "integrating 
microelectronic and other functions such as optical, 
electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and even biological into 
one miniaturized solid state system" holds great importance for 
German industry. "Germany's prospects and qualifications in 
microsystem technology are incomparably better than in 
microelectronics." 
  The initiative in microsystem technology "has led to an 
extremely substantial and broad research infrastructure in 
Germany," which for Heuberger is "a very good fundamental basis 
for industrial development." Now care must be taken that 
national support does not get pushed toward basic research but 
instead fully demands the relevance [of such research] to 
industry. Production technology and system reliability also 
continue to be decisive factors and "not only [whether] new 
systems are feasible in principle." Also required are a 
consolidation of themes and leadership in industry. However, 
"the early support of industry also produced a significant level 
[of work] here, in comparison with other countries, which after 
the initial difficulties culminated in a fruitful coexistence of 
large and small industry." And industrial sectors such as 
automotive technology, telecommunications, medical technology or 
metrology and control engineering, "which are particularly 
dependent on microsystem technology," are well represented in 
Germany as well as in Europe. 
  The victory is far from won, however. The Fraunhofer 
director 
referred to the example of Japan with its "micromachining" 
successor program, where the greatest potential danger lurks. 
"The entire program is carried out there in large industry as a 
supplement to microelectronics, which is already strong there as 
it is." Heuberger's fear is that the Japanese could begin 
product development earlier and more consistently. Nothing is 
yet decided, but the problems which are still to be solved by 
the German initiative in microsystem technology "are 
incomparably more difficult than those in microelectronics, 
where we have already not solved the problems." Also the 
European JESSI [Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative] 
program "does not cover important methods and technologies of 
system integration and system technology because of its 
concentrated focus, desired by industry, on memory or storage 
technology." The weakest aspect is the software: without 
elaborate software simulation systems and design tools, which 
are not on the market yet, there can be no industrial production 
of microsystems. "If we do not succeed at least in building up 
and sustaining an industrial software supplier and in not having 
to buy system software from the USA as we have done, it is all 
pointless," Heuberger warns. 
  However, microsystem technology still offers great 
opportunities, also and specifically for small and medium-sized 
industry in Germany. As Helmut Hund, director of the sensor 
production company of the same name in Wetzlar, emphasizes: 
"Usually, the manufacturing processes of semiconductor 
technology are not accessible to companies of this size." For 
companies of between 20 and 1,000 employees doing business of 
between a few and several hundred million German marks, it has 
been nearly impossible up to now to get into technologies like 
design and simulation, lithography, wet and plasma etching 
technology, or coating and testing technology. 
  The situation is completely different in microsystem 
technology, with small volumes of a few thousand units. No 
longer do smaller structural dimensions or larger and more 
complicated memory determine the level of innovation in 
microsystem technology, as is the case in semiconductor 
technology; [innovation] is instead determined by the 
intelligent combination of various technologies in the areas of 
micromechanics, application specific IC design and sensor 
construction. "Small-scale manufacture combined with relatively 
economical manufacturing processes offer small and medium-sized 
businesses an ideal opportunity against the large companies. It 
offers an opportunity because the price pressure is no where 
near as great as with the semiconductor standard components." 
  There are also hidden risks in microsystem technology, 
however. "The wildest chip ideas come to nothing if the 
corresponding products are not [as written] lacking which can be 
used in industrial and everyday life." The practical Hund sees 
Germany's biggest current problem here. "In every possible 
presentation and in the technical journals there is talk of 
insulin pumps, of miniature robots and of micromechanical drive 
systems," Helmut Hund says mockingly, "but sales are not yet 
being made with products containing these components." Small and 
medium-sized businesses are demanding support not only for 
technologies but also for the development and marking of new 
products. 
  As a man of experience, Helmut Hund knows first-hand the 
problems of small and medium-sized businesses. "No small or 
medium-sized business has the financial resources to reserve all 
the hardware for microsystem technology alone." His credo is, 
therefore, not to make everything alone but rather for small and 
medium-sized businesses to work together from cooperative 
research to realization of the product, a concept for which Hund 
has coined the term cooperative technology. Hund the business 
man grew up in the country and knows what he is talking about: 
"Many farmers could only buy a harvester together which they 
would have been unable to afford individually." However, large 
companies, too, should make use of joint solutions with small 
and medium-sized businesses. Hund: "Then the call for a German 
MITI [(Japanese) Ministry of International Trade and Industry] 
or similar institution would no longer be necessary." 
  Big business, meanwhile, emphasizes its leadership role. 
"For 
rapid industrial development and the use of microsystem 
technology in new products, some mass markets will probably be 
essential at first in which unit price is low and high unit 
numbers of elements, sensors, actuators and components are used, 
such as in automobile technology or domestic and home appliance 
technology"--of this Dr. Horst Schmidt-Bischoffshausen from 
research and technology at Daimler-Benz AG in Munich is certain.

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Castaing: "Demonstration Against </F>
Superphenix Intended To Rouse Antinuclear Movement"] 
  [Text] The protest march to be held from 9 April to 8 May 
by the "Europeans Against Superphenix" ecologist group, going 
from Creys-Malville in the Isere region of France to the prime 
minister's residence in Paris, is intended to reawaken the 
antinuclear movement in the light of the upcoming national 
debate on energy and June's European elections. 
  After years of tranquillity, the hamlet of Faverges, in the 
north of the Isere region, was peacefully invaded on the morning 
of Saturday 9 April by the first participants -- some 1,000 
people -- in the antinuclear march organized by the Europeans 
Against [the] Superphenix [nuclear reactor]. (The coordinating 
group of this group consists of six organizations: the Malville 
committee (Lyons), the FRAPNA (Rhone-Alpes Federation for the 
Protection of Nature), Greenpeace-France, the GSIEN (Group of 
Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy), and the World 
Wildlife Fund, from Milan. It also includes some 300 
associations or groups, including political parties (the Greens, 
Generation Ecology, the Greens in the European Parliament, and 
Red and Green Alternative), and several dozen foreign 
organizations, predominantly German and Swiss.) 
  Faverges had doubtless seen nothing like this since that 
dramatic Sunday 31 July 1977 when a major antinuclear rally 
(over 20,000 demonstrators) degenerated into violent clashes 
with the police, leading to the death of a 30-year old pacifist 
schoolteacher, Vital Michalon who was killed by a grenade. 
Prior to departure [passage omitted] a commemorative plaque was 
unveiled to his memory. 
  This march, which will take the ecologists to the Paris 
Science and Technology Park before moving on to the prime 
minister's office on 8 May, marks the awakening of an 
antinuclear movement which has lost much of its sting in recent 
years, in particular in the area around the Superphenix. The 
local reasons for this are twofold: first, the fast breeder 
reactor has been shut down since 2 July 1990, and concerns have 
thus been lulled; secondly, maintenance operations have created 
some 2,500 jobs. 
  Previously openly opposed to Superphenix, the mayor of a 
small neighboring town expressed an opinion widely shared in the 
region: "We all have relatives working in the power station, so 
now is not the time to be picky, even though I am still aware of 
the specific risks posed by the reactor." 
  It was the government's decision, made on 22 February, to 
use 
Superphenix not as a nuclear power station but as a "reactor 
dedicated to research and experimentation," that jarred its 
opponents back to life. Europeans Against Superphenix 
reiterates that "it was during safety experiments that Soviet 
engineers caused the worst accident in nuclear history." 
Throughout the journey the caravan of protesters will hammer 
out a slogan worthy of [French satirist and comedian] Coluche: 
"If you laughed at Chernobyl, you mustn't miss Creys-Malville!" 
<H5>  Highly Symbolic Stop-Off Points </H5>
  "Pull the plug on Superphenix!" declares the 15-meter long 
banner leading the procession out of Faverges, indicating that 
the protest is focused firmly on the only industrial-scale fast 
breeder reactor in the world and that the ecologists do not 
intend getting way-laid by more general issues. 
  The whole range of arguments against the use, in whatever 
form, of the Creys-Malville plant is used, including its high 
cost and the risk it poses: "In 20 years, this reactor has 
already cost over 50 million French francs [Fr], has only 
operated for 176 days and still wastes Fr600 million a year"; 
and "Superphenix still contains 5 tons of plutonium and 5,000 
tons of sodium." (Superphenix cost Fr27.7 billion in today's 
money to build, Fr7.65 billion of which in interim interest. 
Maintenance costs Fr650 million per year (Fr750-800 million in 
1993). To completely abandon it would cost Fr12billion, to 
which can be added Fr18 billion in compensation for France's 
partners. The station operated for 7,400 hours (slightly more 
than 300 days) since being hooked up to the EDF grid in 1986. 
Fuels used total 5.5 tons of plutonium, while 3,500 tons of the 
5,000 tons of sodium are still contained inside the reactor tank. 
  Encouraged by a precedent -- three days before the scheduled 
restart date of 2 July 1992, the then-Prime Minister Pierre 
Beregovoy froze any decision -- and guessing that the Balladur 
government will not make any further decisions on restarting the 
reactor before the European elections in June, the anti-Phenix 
movement intends putting this period to the best use by exerting 
as much pressure as possible. All the more so, of course, since 
the national energy debate opens at the start of May. 
  The fliers that are to be distributed from Faverges to Paris 
state: "We must put a stop to this costly, dangerous, and 
useless experiment... Errare humanum est, perserverare 
diabolicum [to err is human but to persevere is diabolical]." 
Abandoning the reactor would be considered "a brave and 
positive act." The antinuclear lobby has also broken away from 
its radical attitudes of the past, at least in appearance. 
  In this way, Europeans Against Superphenix is thus again out 
campaigning for support. Greenpeace-France hoped that "the 
march can trigger a chain reaction along its route, mobilizing 
sectors of public opinion reaching far beyond traditional 
ecologist groups. Everyone understands that, behind Superphenix 
there is the need for a greater transparency in the debate on 
energy choices in France." 
  This is why highly symbolic stop-off points have been 
chosen, 
such as the Lyons headquarters of the NERSA, the Superphenix 
operating company; the power stations at Fessenheim (Haut Rhin), 
Cattenom (Moselle) and, on 26 April (eight years to the day 
since the Chernobyl disaster), the station at Nogent-sur-Seine; 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and so on. The march 
will also pass along some Swiss towns (Geneva, Lausanne, and 
Basle), and, the organizers insist, it will also visit a number 
of "alternative sites" promoting renewable energy sources. The 
caravan will also be running a campaign of postcards addressed 
to the prime minister.

  [Text] The fast breeder reactor at Creys-Malville (Isere), 
which has been transformed by the government into a simple tool 
for research and experimentation, could be restarted this summer 
to operate for the first few months at low power levels. A new 
page has been turned with this decision (LE MONDE 24 February). 
The public authorities have made a clearly nonprofit-oriented 
choice regarding the fate of this installation costing 27.7 
billion French francs [Fr] supporting the recommendations made 
in mid-January by DSIN (Nuclear Installations Safety 
Directorate), for whom power production at Superphenix was no 
longer a priority. 
  The industrial logic has thus given way to research 
programs. 
As the Hotel Matignon communique explained it, EDF (France's 
Electric Power Co) "will have no authority over Superphenix' 
operating power levels," but states that CEA (Atomic Energy 
Commissariat), a purely research organization, will henceforth 
enter the game with EDF and NERSA (Nuclear Energy Association), 
which is responsible for the plant's operation. 
  Thus, Superphenix will operate in stages to adapt to a 
research program that is to be proposed by a supervisory 
committee combining NERSA, EDF, and CEA, one or two months from 
now. This program, evaluated by Robert Dautray, high 
commissioner for atomic energy, and Claude Detraz, director of 
CNRS' (National Center for Science and Research) National 
Institute for Subatomic Physics, will be monitored by a 
scientific committee, which will issue a yearly report on the 
experiment conducted. 
  For Gerard Longuet, minister of Industry, Posts, 
Telecommunications and Foreign Trade, and for Francois Fillon, 
minister of Higher Education and Research, this program should 
permit "the preservation of our (France's) lead in the fast 
breeder field," and determine the ability of this way "to 
generate power while managing the plutonium produced, and 
burning up nuclear waste over the long term." Are these also the 
choices of EDF's partners within NERSA, Germany's SBK (Fast 
Breeder Power Plant Co) and Italy's ENEL (Italy's Nuclear 
Electric Power Co). The government, while awaiting the answers, 
is saying that they "(should) accept their responsibility and 
pay the costs." In fact, there are some people who are not 
opposed to reviewing the levels of participation of SBK or ENEL, 
or, if worse comes to worse, seeing one of them drop out of the 
project altogether. Everyone knows that abandoning the reactor 
could cost Fr8-12 billion, and that litigation on this point 
with France's partners could raise this to 18 billion.

<F P=106> [Jean-Paul Croize report: "Nuclear Explosions Inside </F>
Computers"] 
  [Text] When the military planning law for the period 
1995-2000 was presented, it was revealed that between now and 
the end of the century more than 10 billion French francs [Fr] 
are to be invested in developing a highly-sophisticated system 
for simulating nuclear explosions. This is a major scientific 
decision since it will enable experts at the French Arms 
Delegation (DGA) and the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] -- who 
have been pondering the design of such a system since 1991 in 
the framework of the Palen program (for the preparation and 
limitation of nuclear testing) -- to devise new methods for 
performing heavy-duty studies and experiments. Notable 
developments include extremely powerful lasers and 
high-performance computers which would also have considerable 
benefits for the civil domain. 
  While it is hard to imagine, the means do exist for 
simulating or partially reconstructing the diabolical energy 
release that is characterized by the triggering of a 
thermonuclear bomb. Better still, while the most complex means 
of simulation are still confined to the realms of theory, 
certain others already exist in concrete form. In two decades 
these resources have reduced the annual number of real nuclear 
tests carried out on the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean from 
a dozen to just five, before the total test ban moratorium was 
imposed in April 1992. 
  The equipment already used in a number of Defense Ministry 
research centers make it possible to reconstruct some of the 
main mechanical or electromagnetic effects of a nuclear 
explosion, such as the blast, the heat wave, and the high-energy 
radiation flux that is generated. One of the simplest 
simulation tools to design -- but still delicate to use and 
particularly impressive to see in action -- is the giant blast 
tunnel at Grammat in the Lot region of France. Some 110 mt long 
and 12 mt wide, this structure, camouflaged to blend into the 
countryside, makes it possible to subject different types of 
military equipment to a very violent and instantaneous 
pressurization caused by the release in less than one-hundredth 
of a second of 300,000 lt of air stored in giant compressors. 
This involves generating 8 million times the normal atmospheric 
pressure, equivalent to the shock wave of a thermonuclear 
explosion, which, in the tunnel, sweeps jeeps aside like mere 
wisps of straw. 
  Another, less spectacular example but equipment that is 
doubtless even more complex to use, is the "radiation chamber" 
that has been built in the Vernon ballistics and aerodynamics 
research laboratory. This tool -- the only one of its kind in 
Europe -- makes it possible to subject all types of electronic 
components to the kind of intense electromagnetic flash 
generated by an atomic bomb. 
  However, scientists have yet to implement the most difficult 
type of nuclear simulation: reconstructing the processes that 
lie at the heart of the explosion and which, in a few hundredths 
of a second, cause matter to change into other, lighter, atomic 
elements, generating an enormous amount of energy in the 
process. To improve the effectiveness of existing weapons and 
to design new ones -- like the famous neutron bombs -- it is 
vital to be able to accurately predict the operational 
effectiveness of various kinds of architecture and to select one 
material in preference to another. As a result it is essential 
to have "keys" composed either of real tests or a series of 
physical simulations and calculations using codes detailed 
enough to accurately determine by "virtual" means the way in 
which this energy will be released and then dispersed. 
  If they are to pinpoint the actual transmutation of elements 
during an atomic explosion, scientists in the AEC's military 
applications department will have to develop the two tools that 
are essential for any nuclear simulation: power lasers and 
massively parallel computers. The credits awarded for this task 
for the five years covered by the military planning law far 
exceed those currently allocated: the decision to invest a sum 
of Fr10 billion practically multiplies tenfold the budget for 
the Palen program which this year stands at Fr300 million. 
  On the computing level this will be enough to provide 
considerable stimulus for the work being done in France in the 
field of so-called "massively parallel" computing: using 
machines whose architecture is such that they can perform 
simultaneous rather than successive calculations interactively 
-- i.e. in parallel. This technology is still in its infancy, 
but it appears to be the only way of processing the phenomenal 
amount of data (people are talking of several hundred billion 
instructions per second) that this type of simulation requires 
-- even harder to do, say the experts, than atmospheric modeling. 
  Mastering such computing power, the experts claim, could 
only 
benefit the resource-hungry calculations used in weather 
forecasting and computer-assisted aircraft design. 
  In the field of lasers, the Palen program would enable 
France 
to build tools performing better than Phebus, the most powerful 
device currently being used by the AEC in Limeil, near Paris. 
Capable of delivering power of almost 10 kilojoules for about a 
billionth of a second, this would already be enough to light 
veritable miniature suns heating minuscule samples of matter to 
over 10 million degrees. The matter would then be converted into 
plasma such as is found in the core of a thermonuclear weapon. 
A major line of research in future years will consist of 
designing a system for amplifying the flashes emitted by such 
types of equipment to exceed the performance of the American 
"Nova," currently the most powerful laser in the world that can 
put out around 50 kilojoules in flashes of light emitted in a 
single time period of around one nanosecond. 
  In the civil domain, tools such as this would make it easier 
to examine the technology needed to master continuous fusion, 
i.e. generated in reactors that can supply infinitely more 
energy than existing atomic power stations. However, if we are 
to believe many military experts, several more real nuclear 
tests are needed to perfectly calibrate their data with the 
processes that occur inside a real bomb.

<F P=106> [Bernard Broustet report: "Francois Leotard Strengthens </F>
Bordeaux Scientific and Military Pole"] 
  [Text] The Aquitaine region is to receive some compensation 
for the loss of thousands of jobs resulting from cuts in a 
number of arms programs. In Bordeaux last Friday, Defense 
Minister Francois Leotard confirmed that the European Molecular 
Chemistry Institute (created on the initiative of the 
Polytechnic School) would be sited in the city. He also 
announced that a major investment concerning the region would be 
included in the military planning law. The minister gave no 
further details. One possibility is the installation of an 
enormous laser in the region's Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] 
establishment. 
<H5>  Investment Worth 200 Million French Francs </H5>
  The siting in Bordeaux of the Molecular Chemistry Institute 
was announced two years ago, but the plan then seemed to get 
bogged down. Certain members of the Paris scientific community 
put up some resistance to the institute being located in the 
provinces. Francois Leotard's very clear statements on the 
subject appear to indicate that these objections have been 
lifted, and that the institute will indeed be created. 
  Most of the estimated cost of 200 million French francs [Fr] 
will come from local authorities (the Bordeaux city council, the 
general council of the Gironde department, and the regional 
council of Aquitaine) with the European Union also contributing 
through the European Social Fund, according to the terms of 
objective 2. 
  Based in Pessac, near the university, in two to three years 
time the institute will be host to dozens of researchers from 
the Polytechnic School and the universities of Louvain (Belgium) 
and Lausanne (Switzerland). The number of researchers and 
engineers could exceed 200 at the turn of the century. It will 
serve to considerably strengthen the already not insignificant 
potential of the region in the solid chemistry field. 
  The other investment announced by Francois Leotard could be 
worth a great deal more. If the laser theory turns out to be 
true, the figures could run into billions. Designed for nuclear 
test simulation, this high-powered device could also be put to 
other uses by Europe's scientific community.

<F P=106> [Article: "Consultant: Strong Growth in Optical </F>
Communications Market"; Subheads: "Impetus from Heavy Demand for 
Local Area Networks and Network Routing"; "Expansion in Asia and 
Europe"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Stimulated by the rapidly increasing 
demand for beam waveguides for local area networks [LAN] and LAN 
routing, the optical communications market should more than 
double internationally from $4.4 billion in 1992 to an estimated 
$9.1 billion in 1999, according to a market report by the U.S. 
consultancy firm of Frost and Sullivan, Inc. 
  The report also predicts that the beam waveguide cable will 
lose its relative importance as a current driving force for 
market growth in proportion as market focus shifts to shorter 
communication paths and this should lead to greater demand for 
optical transmitters, receivers and routing facilities. 
  As predicted by the consultants, beam waveguide cable will 
shrink from 59 percent of the total market in 1992 to 44 percent 
in the year 1999, whereas receivers will increase in the same 
time period from nine to 17 percent since new technologies will 
facilitate connecting a number of receivers to shared 
transmitters. Market share for transmitters, in turn, will rise 
from 24 to 27 percent, for connectors, from six to eight percent 
and for couplers, from three to four percent. 
  Originally, beam waveguides were installed above all on U.S. 
long-distance networks. But when expansion of the system was 
able to be mostly concluded in recent years, beam waveguide 
installation shifted to international traffic and increasingly 
to LANs and LAN routing. 
  Up until now the optical communications industry has been 
dominated by North America, accounting for 48 percent of 
turnover in 1992. According to the report, there is likely to be 
a decrease since shipments from Pacific Rim countries can be 
expected to increase from 21 to 25 percent and from Europe, from 
20 to 23 percent. Pressure to compete globally will increasingly 
move to the center of planning by manufacturers operating 
internationally. 
  The consultants expect that there will be increased 
installations of beam waveguide systems. On the other hand they 
will be curbed by costs that still continue to be comparatively 
high. A large number of new market participants will be joining 
the global competition and strategic alliances are likely to 
attract a sizable share of the international market. As regards 
the micro-electronic undergirding for optical communications, 
the analysts proceed on the assumption that opto-electronically 
integrated circuits, even in the early phase of their 
development, are likely to be an increasingly attractive 
emergent and cost-effective alternative to the current status of 
component engineering, since they will contribute considerably 
to enhanced system performance. It is highly probable that fiber 
optic amplifiers will displace expensive electronic regenerators 
in optical long-distance communications systems. 
  The report "World Fiber Optic Communikation Markets" is 
priced at $16.95 and is available from Frost and Sullivan Market 
Intelligence, Sullivan House, Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1,

<F P=106> [An article by Ian Holt of Coopers &amp; Lybrand: The Mobile </F>
Green Paper] 
  [Text] Just before Christmas last year, the European 
Commission's telecoms policy directorate produced a draft of its 
long-awaited Green Paper on mobile communications. The full 
document, pending official adoption by the Commission and 
translation into all of the Union's official languages, is 
expected at the time of writing to be published in March/April 
1994. Ian Holt, who contributed to its development, looks at 
the main points of the Green Paper, the background to it, and 
its importance in the overall scheme of things. 
  Construction of European telecommunications policy started 
in 
earnest with the publication of the 1987 telecoms Green Paper. 
The strategy was to tackle the fixed area directly, and to 
address mobile and satellite communications separately. A Green 
Paper on satellite policy appeared in 1990, but the mobile Green 
Paper seemed to drift off the agenda. 
  Therein lies an apparently famous fact about the mobile 
Green 
Paper -- that it is two years late. This stems from linking the 
Green Paper (like a lot of things) to the deadline for 
completion of the single market by the end of 1992; it does not 
refer specifically to the state of development of the mobile 
sector itself. 
  In fact, in these terms, the timing of the Green Paper is 
about right, coming at a point where the balance of opinion 
believes that a large consumer market for personal 
communications is going to develop. This provides a strategic 
focus for policy development and a forward-looking context for 
analysis of the current environment. 
  In 1990-1991, a formative period for the shaping of mobile 
trends as well as telecoms policy, the Green Paper would have 
had less of a sense of direction. And since actions were 
already being taken to promote pan-European mobile 
communications and introduce competition (second GSM licenses 
being granted in France, Germany and elsewhere), it would have 
had less to say. 
  As it is, the Green Paper is able to build on recent 
technological, market and policy advances to propose new 
directions of consequence to telecommunications as a whole. 
<H5>  Main Goals of the Mobile Green Paper </H5>
  The Green Paper is driven by two main aims. 
<H8>  Single Market </H8>
  The first of these is to ensure the existence of a 
Union-wide 
market for mobile communications. European telecommunications 
policy has been largely shaped through application of the single 
market and -- of particular relevance to telecoms -- the 
competition provisions of the EEC Treaty, and the present Green 
Paper is no exception. 
  Mobile services currently remain outside the scope of the EC 
directives which carry the main thrusts of telecoms policy, 
concerning market opening, licensing and open network provision 
(ONP). A core job of the Green Paper is therefore to propose 
how to extend these directives and the principles embodied in 
them into the mobile area, taking account of the specific 
circumstances of the sector. 
  Pursuing the single market aim in the fixed 
telecommunications area has set an important context for the 
Green Paper. In June 1993, following the Commission's 1992 
review of telecommunications, the Council of the European Union 
plumped for full liberalisation of telecoms services starting in 
1998. For mobile policy, a key question arising was how to 
interpret full liberalisation in a sector where limited 
frequency availability leads to restricted entry. Of a more 
strategic nature, it became of interest to consider what new 
factors would come into play as a consequence of dissolving the 
regulatory boundary between fixed and mobile service areas. 
<H8>  Development of Personal Communications </H8>
  The second aim comes from within the sector itself, and 
gives 
the Green paper its strategic focus. This is to push the 
development in Europe of a mass market for personal 
communications services (linking this to a point with the 
"Trans-European Networks" initiative introduced via the 
Maastricht Treaty). In part, this is because the Commission 
sees personal communications as an area in which Europe could 
lead the world, building on the success of GSM. 
  The Green paper suggests that as many as 80 million 
Europeans 
could be users of mobile personal communications by 2010, with 
ultimate potential to reach 80 per cent of the total population 
(i.e., one connection per adult -- easily exceeding the 
penetration level for fixed telephony). The most critical 
factor for achieving mass market penetrations is seen to be the 
price of handsets; it is predicted that take-up will accelerate 
significantly once prices fall below 250 ECUs. 
  It is envisaged that personal communications will be based, 
at least initially, on combinations of existing systems such as 
GSM, DC51800 and DECT, together with intelligent functions 
providing mobility services on the fixed network, and use of 
satellite personal communications in thinly-populated areas. 
The Green Paper further sees that "personal communications will 
ultimately allow person-to-person calling independent of the 
location and the terminal used, the means or transmission (wired 
or wireless) and/or choice of technology." Flexibility in 
service provision, including the possibility to combine services 
offered via different networks and technologies in response to 
market demand, is seen as particularly important to enable 
movement in this direction. 
  Whilst noting Europe's generally strong positioning for 
development of personal communications, the Green Paper also 
highlights a number of barriers to market development, 
including: -- maintenance of restrictions on entry and operation 
which constrain market development and prevent equality of 
opportunity for market participants; -- market fragmentation, 
caused by different licensing arrangements in different 
countries and through awarding licences along the lines of radio 
system technologies (a consequence of frequency assignment 
methods); -- lack of a common approach regarding service 
provision, in particular by independent service providers, which 
could provide flexibility to overcome problems of market 
fragmentation; -- constraints on freedom to achieve economic 
mobile network operation, particularly regarding dependence on 
fixed network operators for interconnection and infrastructure; 
-- lack of firm timetables for allocation of frequencies for key 
personal communications technologies. 
<H5>  Main Proposals </H5>
  The Green Paper's major prescription for realising the goals 
and overcoming the barriers set out above is, unsurprisingly, to 
maximise commercial freedom and allow market forces to play a 
full role. A broad interpretation of the Green Paper's 
positions picks out the following as components of the 
regulatory regime proposed for mobile services: 
<H5>  Open Market </H5>
  -- Abolition of exclusive and special rights for mobile 
network operation, in essence requiring introduction of 
competition and non-discretionary licensing. The Green Paper 
states that the procedures and criteria for award of licences 
should be fully objective and transparent, and that applicants 
should be treated in an equal manner. 
  The Green Paper does not recommend a method of awarding 
licences, but states that the method chosen should aim 
particularly at maximising benefits for users e.g., in terms of 
prices, quality, etc. It implies that licensing competitions 
(beauty parades or auctions) should be resorted to only where 
there is contention for available frequencies. It stops short 
of suggesting that regulators should leave determination of 
numbers of entrants to the market. 
  -- Unrestricted entry into service provision. The Green 
Paper states that both independent service providers and mobile 
network operators should be allowed entry. It further states 
that mobile network operators should accept all reasonable 
requests from service providers (including those integrated with 
other mobile network operators) to deal, within the limits of 
normal commercial practice and competition law. It considers 
that service provision does not require licensing, however 
service providers should follow a self-regulation code of 
conduct. 
  -- Mutual recognition. The Green Paper extends the 
principles of mutual recognition of national authorisations into 
the mobile area, in order to reduce barriers to entry in 
different countries. However, it points out that full mutual 
recognition of mobile network operator licences is only possible 
where there is no limitation on the number of operators. As 
regards service providers, it states that their established 
relationships with mobile operators should be fully recognised. 
  -- Frequency availability. The Green Paper stresses the need 
to efficiently use frequency spectrum, to involve market 
participants in frequency planning and to publish clear and 
non-discriminatory frequency allocation procedures. 
<H5>  Level Playing Field </H5>
  -- Non-discriminatory licensing conditions. This includes 
abolition of special rights granting any player a lasting 
advantage. 
  -- Safeguards in licensing to ensure equal treatment. The 
Green paper makes specific reference to the interface between 
mobile network operators and service providers. It considers 
that the licenses of mobile network operators should require 
sufficient transparency, in particular concerning accounting, to 
allow supervision of service provision activities which are 
integrated into their operations. 
<H5>  Freedom of Operation </H5>
  -- Minimum necessary regulation. The Green paper considers 
that regulation should be limited to what is justified in the 
general interest. It states that mobile licensing conditions 
may set purblicservice requirements concerning permanence, 
availability and quality of service, and should restrict 
activities only on the grounds of "essential requirements" such 
as the integrity of public networks. 
  -- Free combination of service offerings. The Green paper 
sees as essential for development of personal communications the 
freedom for service providers to offer a combination of mobile 
services provided under different licences (in the same or 
different countries) and using different technologies. Come 
1998, this freedom should be extended across both fixed and 
mobile areas. 
  -- The Green Paper indicates that mobile network operations 
would as a normal rule be allowed to expand their mobile 
operations through bids for multiple licences. From 1998, 
mobile operators could bid for licences for provision of public 
voice via the fixed network, and fixed network operators could 
bid for mobile licences. 
  -- Open interconnection. The Green Paper indicates that the 
principles of interconnection defined under ONP for access to 
the fixed network should be employed in the mobile area. Mobile 
operators should respond to reasonable requests for 
interconnection, with agreement reached primarily through 
commercial negotiation. They should be allowed to directly 
interconnect, both within and between Member States. 
  -- Infrastructure. The Green Paper considers that mobile 
network operators should have rights to establish their own 
infrastructure or use that provided by a third party, subject to 
use for their licensed activities. They should also be able to 
share infrastructure and sites. 
  The implementation of these proposed positions is seen to 
involve some extension of EC directives, but mainly requires 
action to be taken by administrations and regulators at the 
national level. 
  EC mobile policy did not start with the Green paper (but 
could only get so far without it). Since 1987, actions have 
been taken in a number of key areas: 
  -- Support for introduction of GSM, ERMES and DECT. In 1987, 
the EU Council of Ministers adopted a recommendation and 
accompanying directive promoting the coordinated introduction of 
GSM. The recommendation set targets for rollout and 
availability; the directive required Member States to make 
available the necessary frequencies. Subsequently, a similar 
dual measure approach was taken in 1990 for ERMES (digital radio 
paging) and in 1991 for DECT (digital cordless). 
  -- Frequency coordination framework. In 1990, the Council 
adopted a resolution calling for CEPT wide cooperation on radio 
frequencies focused on the CEPT European Radiocommunications 
Committee (ERC). The ERC adopted a mechanism in 1991 for 
implementation of 'ERC Decisions' which the EC Council 
subsequently said should be used in preference to EC frequency 
directives. The arrangements for cooperation between the 
Commission and the CEPT bodies concerned under this approach are 
being worked out. A similar framework is being developed for 
numbering. 
  -- Introduction of competition. The Commission's competition 
directorate, DGIV, has acted to encourage a small number of 
Member States to license a second GSM operator. 
  -- Mobile terminals. The first common technical regulations 
(OTRs) were adopted in 1993 as the basis for mutual recognition 
of type approval of GSM terminals according to the 1991 
directive covering this subject. 
  -- Research and development. The RACE mobile project 
(Research Into Advanced Communications in Europe) is carrying 
out research into a 3rd- generation UMTS system (Universal 
Mobile Telecommunications System). 
<H5>  Actions to Promote Development </H5>
  A number of further actions at the European level are 
proposed to promote development of Europe-wide mobile and 
personal communications. These include: 
  -- Completion of CEPT-wide frameworks for frequency and 
numbering coordination. 
  -- Promoting Europe-wide introduction of key personal 
communications systems, such as DCS1800, UMTS and LEOs, via the 
setting of firm frequency allocation schedules and, for future 
systems, coordinated/Community-level licensing. 
  -- Introducing a European numbering space for Europe-wide 
personal numbers. 
  -- Establishing a code of conduct for service providers. 
  -- Setting up an action programme to address concerns about 
health hazards and interference from radiocommunications devices 
and establish safety standards. 
  -- Promoting standarisation to ensure interconnection and 
interoperability, including access to intelligent network 
functionality. 
  -- Working out common positions with regard to non- EEA 
countries concerning porvision of mobile and personal 
communications. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  The mobile Green Paper shows that there is a lot more to 
mobile policy than simply licensing two operators in each area. 
It points, for example, to the structure of the sector itself 
and indicates a general requirement for greater flexibility. 
  The timing of the Green paper is just about right, 
coinciding 
with initial steps towards development of personal 
communications. This allows it to contribute some significant 
ideas concerning the future direction of European 
telecommunications, such as the emergence of the 
wholesale/retail concept -- with service providers operating 
across the boundaries of network provision -- as a major 
structure for the future supply of telecommunications services 
in Europe. 
  Its timing also allows it to take advantage of the recent 
policy success of the 1992 telecoms review, for example 
initiating the adaptation of ONP towards becoming a set of 
general regulatory principles applicable throughout the sector. 
  Overall, better late.

  [Text] Bonn, 24 May. Germany and the European Union (EU) 
urgently need to take initiatives to expand information highways 
for multimedia applications of the future so as not to fall 
behind America and Japan in the competition. This was the 
conclusion of a conference among high-level representatives of 
business and science which was called by Federal Research 
Minister Paul Krueger. 
  Information highways refer to rapid, high-volume 
transmission 
networks which include such applications as video conferences, 
the individual ordering of movies or news, home shopping, or the 
exchange of data among computers for scientific and business 
purposes. 
  Krueger, Heinrich von Pierer (the chairman of Siemens AG), 
and Mark Woessner (the chairman of Bertelsmann AG) emphasized 
that Germany has good technical prerequisites for the multimedia 
services of the future. The network infrastructure is very 
good, Krueger said. Based on a study which his ministry 
contracted, however, Krueger pointed out infrastructure 
shortcomings which hamper innovations. There are gaps in the 
technical and organizational integration of the systems, in the 
development of specific software, and in the availability of 
services which do not utilize all the existing possibilities, he 
said. Krueger and von Pierer said that fees in Germany are too 
high in comparison with international norms. The Siemens head 
questioned whether the postal reform will change this situation. 
According to the study, the level of tariffs for leased 
services was three to seven times higher than in other 
industrialized nations. Deutsche Telekom contested this 
finding. Krueger specifically supported the demand by Professor 
Eberhard Witte (University of Munich) and the industrialists 
that more competition and deregulation was needed in the 
telecommunications infrastructure. Only then will one obtain an 
extensive array of services, low prices, rising investments, and 
new jobs in the telecommunications sector, they said. 
  In the conversations, concern was expressed that delays 
would 
arise which would be difficult to overcome if the Telekom's 
network monopoly were not be eliminated until 1998, as is 
currently planned. Krueger said that one must reconsider this 
situation in connection with the postal reform. Krueger, a CDU 
member, also pointed out that the agreement of the SPD would be 
needed for the reform project. 
  During the conversations, Krueger was urged to take an 
initiative in the field of data highways during the German 
chairmanship of the European Union (EU) in the second half of 
1994. He agreed to do so. Von Pierer said that something 
concrete must be done in this area as soon as possible on both 
the German and EU level. As a first step, progress must be made 
in standardization on the European level. Moreover, there should 
be specific pilot projects. Thus the planned data highways 
between Bonn and Berlin should be rapidly tackled, Von Pierer 
said. 
  To open up the multimedia services, a change in the 
broadcasting law is necessary, said Woessner. The previous 
concept of broadcasting does not fit the new applications. When 
the broadcasters' state contract is amended, one must drop the 
previous limit, according to which a company may not own more 
than 49 percent of the shares of a broadcaster, said Woessner. 
Those participating in the conversation stressed that the large 
number of future television channels, which is controversial 
with the public, is only one of the new applications.

  [Text] A great future is being predicted for the mobile 
telephone. By the year 2000 around 10 million Germans could be 
mobile telephone subscribers. The entire telecommunications 
field should by then have a greater importance in the national 
economy than the automobile industry. Provided that the federal 
liberalization and the elimination of monopolies proceeds 
rapidly. And, not least of all, the natural, comfortable use of 
the mobile phone--that is, its development from luxury item into 
consumer good--should contribute to such rates of growth. At the 
current time, however, being constantly accessible [by 
telephone] remains a luxury. There are approximately 1.8 million 
mobile phone subscribers in Germany who treat themselves to this 
still costly freedom. It is primarily business customers then 
who are acquiring [phones by] the only two competitors currently 
in this market, the Telekom subsidiary DeTeMobil and the private 
Mannesmann Mobilfunk. 
  That is supposed to change in May when E-plus wants to start 
[operating]: this new company, under the management of Thyssen 
and Veba, was officially granted a license for a second private 
mobile phone network last May and was founded in April. New 
focus groups, like the young, singles and regionally active 
business people, will be targeted. The goal of the newcomer is 
to conquer the mass market. 
  And without a doubt the structure of the market will change 
greatly with the entry of E-plus: the buildup of the network 
will be forced; the use of mobile phones will develop more 
quickly into a consumer good; the initially strongly regional 
company E-plus will bring about a change in the rate policies, 
also in those of the competition, and thus a mid-term reduction 
in price. 
  With the start-up of E-plus the market will finally be 
opened 
up. Since the new company does not want to present itself--next 
to DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk--as the "third in the 
alliance" of those who have been granted a lucrative license. 
E-plus wants to act. We can well be curious about the marketing 
mix. The suspicion that the two other licensees, to the 
detriment of their initial customers, are trying in a "secret 
alliance" to amortise their network as quickly as possible is 
unresolved. Customers can hope that when E-plus enters the 
market, then this often criticized "alliance" will break up. 
  If we look at the head start that DeTeMobil and Mannesmann 
Mobilfunk already have now with the build-up of the network and 
the acquisition of customers, then E-plus's strategy seems born 
of necessity. The past year and a half have shown that the 
market actually is growing more quickly than the optimistically 
intended forecasts made at the start of D1 and D2 predicted: for 
1993 the two [service] providers counted on 300,000 to 350,000 
subscribers. Nearly a million customers, however, were actually 
signed up by the end of last year. And the number increases 
daily by two thousand. The reason is first and foremost the 
unexpectedly large decrease in the price of the mobile phone. 
The strategy of the newcomer could thus bear fruit, although it 
will not be able to reach the profit zone until after the two 
established [companies]. 
  The rapid development in the mobile phone occurs, however, 
in 
the face of increased competition which is to the detriment of 
some private providers of equipment and services. The price of 
the equipment has dropped dramatically, and it is here that the 
struggle for customers is already being waged. The calling 
charges are actually relatively stabile. That leads to the 
"English sickness" in Germany, too: the equipment is to some 
extent sold below cost in the hopes that customers will be 
industrious about booking "air-time," that is, will use the 
telephone. The success of this strategy is hampered by the high 
prestige value of the mobile phone. For many, the possession of 
this phone is more important than the telephoning, especially 
since that is very expensive. These customers, however, do not 
make the business profitable for the now 13 private service 
providers. 
  But also the three network providers are struggling with 
starting difficulties. The old burden of structural difficulties 
is giving DeTeMobil a great deal of trouble; Mannesmann 
Mobilfunk cannot keep up with the high level of advertising 
activity by DeTeMobil, which is written off as cross 
subsidization by the parent [company]; and the newcomer E-plus 
must after all start out with high investment costs [coupled] 
with a simultaneous late start compared to the established 
competition. Since in spite of some still existing "phone 
service gaps"--the DeTeMobil and Mannesmann Mobilfunk networks 
already almost blanket Germany now--E-plus must make due at 
first with patchwork solutions. On the other hand, the start-up 
costs are lower than for the two D-networks operators. The costs 
for the infrastructure are estimated to be between twenty and 
thirty percent more favorable than in 1990. 
  The way to the mass market is, however, also being smoothed 
over by the newcomer. The new network is laid out in such a 
close-knit fashion that telephones can be used which have a 
substantially lower transmitting power than the phones in use up 
until now, which also means the batteries will last longer. And 
the smaller and more compact that the telephones are, the 
greater will be their acceptance by the public. Experts predict 
that in a while around 90% of the end units will be pocket 
models. 
  When all networks are so built up that units with low 
transmitting power are sufficient, the decisive [factor] in the 
market success of the product will no longer lie with the 
technology of mobile phones but rather and especially with the 
marketing and thus also with the price. The Pan-European digital 
GSM standard does not permit a great deal of differentiation. If 
the price over the mid term approaches that of the [landline] 
network, however, it will become clear that mobile communication 
offers not only a complement by rather an authentic alternative 
to location-bound telecommunication. Only then will the mobile 
telephone enjoy the future which is being predicted for it.

<F P=106> [Article by Gerd Krause: "German Railways and Bundeswehr Do </F>
Not Use DBP Telekom: Special Communications Networks Are a 
Specialty of Stuttgart's Alcatel-SEL: New Railway System Is 
ISDN-Capable for Digital and Analog Connections"] 
  [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 1 April 94 - Instead of 
using the DBP Telekom system, power companies, the Bundeswehr, 
and the German Railways have their own communications systems. 
Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed much of the 
network, calls this developmental field "special networks." The 
company's know-how is now beginning to pay off. Such special 
networks are becoming an export hit for the Stuttgart 
enterprise. 
  John Doe is not the only person who likes to chat on the 
telephone. Military personnel and railway workers also have 
frequent recourse to the telephone. This occurs in the course of 
their normal duties, but with a significant difference. While 
Mister Average Citizen, providing he or she is not telephoning 
via a private D2 mobile system, as a customer of the DBP (German 
Federal Post Office) Telekom, uses the postal service's line 
system, the military and the railway employees enjoy a 
privilege. In addition to the power companies (EVU) and the 
former Federal Railway System, the armed forces are also 
exempted from DBP Telekom's telephone service monopoly. These 
three user groups can operate their own systems for internal 
communications traffic, i.e., the railways, the Bundeswehr and 
the power companies have their own communications systems. 
Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed most of these 
systems, calls them "special networks." "Special networks," as 
Wolfgang Dietze, the director of the special network systems, 
defines them, "serve all of us, although they do not belong to 
the Telekom's public communications system." 
  The German military is especially ambitious. In order to be 
independent of the public infrastructure, the Bundeswehr decided 
to build its own communications system. Alcatel-SEL had proposed 
a single system for the military, but the Luftwaffe, the Navy, 
and the Army could not agree on a common system. Each branch of 
service wanted its own. Consequently, in 1989 SEL installed a 
nationwide system with 6,500 connections for the Bundeswehr and 
another nationwide special network with 40 large exchange 
centers specifically for the Luftwaffe. The eccentric Navy chose 
a wireless system. At taxpayer's expense, Fleet Command ordered 
its own directional radio system from the Stuttgart company. 
  The know-how gained by the Stuttgart workers in developing 
these systems is now becoming an export hit. The technology 
underlying the special networks is the Alcatel 1000 S12 System, 
which had been developed for public communications use and which 
is used in Germany and in many other countries of the world by 
DBP Telekom. To date, Alcatel-SEL has built special networks for 
the armies of Thailand and Saudi Arabia, and last year the Swiss 
Railways received a modern integrated service digital network 
(ISDN) with 480 exchange centers. The modernization of the 
Chilean railways system with 30,000 connections promises to be a 
most impressive contract. 
  An actual contract is the new nationwide ISDN-network for 
the 
German Federal Railways--the former State-run Bundesbahn and 
Reichsbahn. This project has been underway since July 1993 with 
Alcatel-SEL as the consortial leader. Alcatel-SEL delivers the 
lion's share of the entire switching technology, while the group 
consisting of Siemens, ANT, and Alcatel-SEL delivers most of the 
transmission technology. 
  As compared with public systems, special networks are small. 
The most common definition, advanced by Wolfgang Dietze, puts 
the number at up to 200,000 connections. The technology may be 
seen in the example of the German Railways system. The 
performance features--complete ISDN capability--are not limited 
to local exchanges, but are available throughout the network, 
mostly for subscribers with digital and analog connections. 
Thus, for example, at any location in the rail system a 
nationwide conference call capability (add-on third parties) 
with ten subscribers can be established. Other performance 
features are preset transfers in the case of a busy connection, 
automatic recall, multiple numbers, secret numbers, and the 
setting up of closed user groups. In addition, digital 
subscribers receive other performance features like telephone 
number indicators, call units indicators, or equipment selection 
with select terminal number. 
  The compatibility of the special networks with analog and 
digital technology is one of their strongest performance 
features. All kinds of switching technologies can be used in an 
exchange center. Connections can be made with digital and analog 
technology, even the public exchange technology can be hooked 
up. The modular construction permits the system to be expanded 
gradually, so that the network, as originally planned, can be 
extended to several subscribers if necessary. 
  In future, the German Railways system could become of 
interest to the telephone companies. The telephone monopoly in 
the countries of the European Union ends in 1998 and, according 
to the Wolfgang Boetsch, the German Minister of the Postal 
Service, the network monopoly will no longer be able to be 
maintained. For the German Railways, this will mean that its 
nationwide communications system could be opened up to private 
customers. At any rate, Dietze emphasizes, it would become 
technically possible to do so. Thus, for example, a customer in 
Duesseldorf could select the railways exchange via his local 
Telekom system, be switched to Hamburg through the railways 
system, and speak to the other party on the Alster on the local 
Telekom system there. Since Alcatel-SEL has selected the 
internationally standardized Nr. 7 signalling procedure for the 
special network, the transition to the public system would 
easily be possible. "Technically," Dietze asserts, "everything 
is in place." The 34 Mbit/s transmission capacity of the fiber 
glass cables excludes the possibility of any bottlenecks 
developing, while the exchange facilties can be expanded on a 
modular basis. 
  The German Railways' new extensive system is entirely 
comparable to the Telekom system as far as extensive 
interconnections are concerned. But it is smaller, having been 
initially designed for only 120,000 subscribers, while about 42 
million now subscribe to Telekom's system. 
  In the first phase of its system expansion, the Railways is 
installing network nodal centers, which are comparable to small 
regional networks, at 44 sites. In turn, about 100 terminal 
exchanges are attached to them. Even the expansion process is 
similar to that of the postal system. The Railways system 
consists of both fiber glass lines and directional radio. In 
general, the fiber glass cables run underground along the left 
and right sides of the track for a total of over 30,000 km.

By the End of the Century"] 
  [Text] Telecom Services expects double-digit growth this 
year in the promising multimedia area. The business-customer 
section will grow by 12 percent to around 29 billion DM, and 
private sales will increase 10 percent to 32 billion, said 
members of the board Horst Gellert and Dieter Gallist at the 
CeBIT in Hannover 
  In the future, not only voice, but also images, data, and 
video will be transmitted over data lines. "The multimedia 
area, in which 300 million DM is now invested in Germany, will 
be worth 7 billion DM by the year 2000. Sales will also 
increase 24-fold," said Gellert. Telecom wishes to have a 
healthy share of this growth. 
  Among business customers, Gellert is placing special 
emphasis 
on ISDN in addition to the traditionally largest business area 
of telephone services. Telecom can become the world leader in 
introducting this future technology with more than 1.2 million 
B-channels sold. 
  ISDN sales rose more than 130 percent to 2.5 billion DM in 
1993. An increase to 3.7 billion DM is anticipated for 1994. 
In the future, ISDN should become available as a 
high-performance data net for communication among personal 
computers. To date, few personal computers have been holed up 
to the telephone net in Germany. 
  More and more, telephone connection will become a universal 
telecommunication medium, said Gallist. In the future, 
stationary and mobile telecommunications will grow together. 
"Every customer can be reached through one telephone number even 
during this decade, whether he is telephoning from a mobile or 
stationary set," says the telephone executive. The most 
important customer among private sales is a telephone service 
with approximately 30 million customers and with planned sales 
of 25.4 billion DM this year. 
  Telecom also expects good business through interactive 
television. The feedback channel of custoiners for program 
requests will be telephone connection. The Pay-TV-Market also 
offers enormous potential. The number of subscribers will 
increase from 760,000 to 3.4 million by the year 2000.

<F P=106> [Frederic Fassot report: "France Telecom Switches the Core </F>
of the Public Network to an `All-Optical' Configuration"] 
  [Text] France Telecom recently unveiled its plan for 
modernizing the French switched telephone network (STN) that was 
launched three or four years ago. While the public operator 
does not envisage any significant increase in its investment 
budget for this task (each year it plows in 20-25 billion French 
francs [Fr] out of a total budget of Fr30 billion), the 
technological choices that have just been announced, however, do 
threaten to change the list of the company's registered 
suppliers. This is a game of musical chairs whose stakes run 
into billions of French francs, since, for example, each year 
France Telecom spends around Fr4 billion on transmission 
equipment and Fr6 billion on public network switching. 
  The French public network, with the highest proportion of 
digitization in the world (85 percent in switching and 90 
percent in transmission) will therefore undergo massive change. 
The changes announced, however, only concern the core of the 
network (the transmission network) which runs from the five main 
transit switchers to the 13,800 local centers. On the other 
hand, there should be no changes in the short-term for the 
distribution network, i.e., the links between the local centers 
and the 30 million subscribers, which represent between 40 and 
50 million connection lines. Thus, the changeover to an 
"all-optical" configuration does not directly affect the 
subscriber and does not therefore herald a possible "information 
highway." 
<H5>  National Network Cabled in Optical Fiber by 1996 </H5>
  However, far-reaching changes have been announced for the 
transmission network. Firstly, these changes could enable it to 
handle the massive increase in traffic generated by the decision 
to cable the distribution network with optical fiber to the door 
of the subscriber. Secondly, these changes affect all the 
network functions: switching (all switches will work by 
time-division switching by 1998), transmission, and signaling 
(where the network is controlled by the transmission of commands 
between switches), without forgetting network supervision 
(administration and technical management). 
  The greatest challenge concerns transmission, with the 
generalization of SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) technology 
and optical fiber: by 1998, the structure of the France Telecom 
transmission network will be almost exclusively cabled with 
monomode optical fiber, and as a result, coaxial cable and 
Hertzien links will be dropped completely for this purpose. At 
the end of 1993, the national network included some 12,000 
kilometers of optical fiber cable, with 22,000 km on the 
associated regional networks. This represented a total of 
820,000 km of monomode fiber (since each cable can now carry an 
enormous number of fibers). This figure will reach 1.3 million 
in 1996 when, with 21,000 km, the national network will have 
been completed, while the total length of the regional networks 
will be 43,000 km. By the year 2000, two million kilometers of 
optical fiber should be in service, with 80,000 km of cable for 
the regional networks. These are mouthwatering prospects for 
Alcatel and the SAT [Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications], 
which have been selected to supply optical fiber. However, 
where SDH equipment is concerned, it is harder to spot the 
eventual winners. The adoption of this technology, which today 
makes it possible to transmit at a speed of 2.5 Gbits/s down a 
single fiber (the equivalent of 30,000 telephone lines) and 10 
Gbits/s in three or four years' time, will lead to a complete 
reconfiguration of the network architecture from an arborescent 
structure to a structure of regional loops (about 100) connected 
up to five major national branches, or, to use the France 
Telecom term, petals. This loop structure will thus ensure dual 
network access at all levels so that, if an incident is 
generated on the loop it will be possible to automatically 
reroute the traffic along the second branch of the loop. 
<H5>  Suppliers to be Chosen Before the Summer </H5>
  The first 2.5 Gbits/s-per-fiber petal will be looped up in 
the autumn of 1994 (in eastern France, followed by the north). 
By then, the suppliers will have to be chosen. The first 
choice concerns the I/O multiplexors which make it possible to 
catch data "in flight" at different transmission speeds without 
demultiplexing, and then inject them into the 155 Mbits/s loop. 
Each loop should have three to four multiplexors (or around 400 
systems in total). A number of groups are competing on this 
market: Alcatel, the SAT in partnership with Siemens, Secre in 
association with the Israeli company ECI, Nokia, and TRT-PKI 
(Philips). Suppliers could be selected within a few weeks, 
although Jean-Pierre Poitevin, director of the public network, 
warns: "No one is today capable of meeting the specifications 
promised on paper." Then the suppliers of the SDH patch bays 
(which do the actual switching) will be chosen. Alcatel and the 
SAT have already been selected to supply the 2.5 Gbits/s 
point-to-point transmission line systems on the petals. 
<H5>  A "Programmable" Network for Dedicated Links </H5>
  The other major innovation on the public network concerns 
dedicated links. Until now, these links have been permanent and 
built at the request of companies for the transmission of their 
data. However, to reduce service costs by eliminating some of 
the civil engineering costs involved in link connection, France 
Telecom has recently decided to build a separate network for 
dedicated links. Christened MDTN (multiservice digital 
transport network), this network will be fully precabled in 
optical fiber. A connection is then made by programming it in, 
the physical link being already in place. This technique of 
optical fiber precabling is also starting to be used to build 
FOC's (flexible optical connections) for major professional 
customers and densely-populated business districts. Already, 
some 200 buildings have been cabled in the Defense business 
district of Paris, offering high-thruput services (up to 34 
Mbits/s). In 1998, 1,500 buildings will be cabled, and France 
Telecom has also examined the possibility of cabling 5,000 
additional buildings. Lastly, network control, or signaling, 
will also be considerably modified. Initially, the data 
required to control the network (the status and availability of 
equipment, billing, etc.) were exchanged over voice links. From 
now on, the Semaphore signaling network will be kept separate 
from the voice network to increase the data exchange capacity 
required by the proliferation of new services such as the 
upcoming capacity to transmit messages in the course of a 
communication, or to identify the incoming call number -- 
services which could thus open up new markets for terminals. 
  In fact, the general network will consist of four networks 
one on top of the other: the voice and Semaphore networks, but 
also an "intelligent" network and the technical supervision 
network. Thanks to the "intelligent" network, new services 
could rapidly be developed simply by altering the software in 
the centralized database -- service modifications could even be 
done in real time! As a result, certain instructions will no 
longer be programmed into all network switches, but will instead 
be placed in the central database which the switches would then 
consult. This will greatly simplify the technical management of 
the telecoms system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Information Superhighways: France </F>
Telecom Favors European Approach"] 
  [Text] Paris--The rapid development of information 
superhighways "requires a voluntarist European approach" that 
will not necessarily be consistent "with the will for 
accelerated deregulation that is desired by some people in 
Europe," said Marcel Roulet, president of France Telecom, in an 
interview published in LE FIGARO on 28 March. 
  "The market is not leading automatically to the development 
of information superhighways," Roulet added, emphasizing that 
the development of Minitel in France demonstrates that "a 
political will" is also required. 
  When questioned about the announced privatization of the 
Belgian telephone company Belgacom, the president of France 
Telecom suggested that France Telecom might be a candidate, 
explaining that he is hoping for the "widest possible 
development of partnerships among European operating companies." 
He added, however, that "the stand taken by European authorities 
will be the determining factor in that trend, and it would not 
be in Europe's interest if alliances only with non-European 
operating companies were possible for Belgacom." 
  Lastly, Roulet reaffirmed that his objective is to get his 
group out of debt and reduce its financial costs to less than 3 
percent of turnover by 1998, that being the year when all 
telecommunication services in the European Community will be 
opened up to competition.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Olivet: "Alcatel Restructuring Its </F>
Optoelectronics Forces..."] 
  [Text] Optoelectronic components are strategic for 
many of the group's subsidiaries. The world's number one in 
telecommunications is federating its optical activities, thus 
preserving its technological independence and making its entry 
into the free marketplace. 
  Alcatel's optoelectronic components are now prospering and 
are highly regarded. The group is combining its activities and 
creating a specialized subsidiary, Alcatel Optronics. The new 
company will employ 290 persons and has set its goals at a 
revenue of 250 million French francs [Fr] and a sales growth of 
20 percent in 1994. 
  A streamlining had become indispensable. The group's 
capabilities had become numerous and too dispersed. Alcatel-CIT 
is a major player in underwater communications system 
components. Several of its Marcoussis Research Center 
laboratories are highly reputed for their developmental work in 
optoelectronics. Its German subsidiary SEL has been active in 
this sector for many years. 
  Based at Nozay, in Essonne, Alcatel Optronics will be 
responsible for the group's activities in the development, 
manufacturing, and commercialization of optoelectronics 
components. Its ultramodern plant will produce the active 
components (lasers and photodetectors) whose production until 
now has been split between its Marcoussis and SEL's German plant 
sites. The latter will henceforth concentrate on passive 
components (multiplexers), while the Lannion plant will do the 
assembling and testing of products designed for underwater use. 
  In thus bringing all of its skills in this sector into a 
single entity, Alcatel affirms the strategic nature of 
optoelectronic technologies. Alcatel's president, Pierre Suard, 
has always kept a close watch over the group's technological 
independence..., especially in its core specialties. With optics 
becoming the heart of telecommunications, Alcatel, the world's 
number one in telecommunications finds it unacceptable to be 
dependent upon American and Japanese suppliers for its needs. 
  Alcatel Optronics will supply the needs of the group's other 
subsidiaries in the fields of transmission (Alcatel-CIT, SEL, 
Telettra, Alcatel Network Systems) and, tomorrow, switching 
(Alcatel Bell and Alcatel-CIT). "Our objective is to cover the 
quasi-totality of the group's needs, versus the half that is 
currently being covered," says Philippe Bregi, Alcatel 
Optronics's commercial and marketing director. 
<H5>  20% to 30% of Sales To Be Outside of Group in </H5>
 5 Years 
  Beyond its captive markets, consisting of the group's 
subsidiaries, the company has decided to enter the world market 
in optoelectronic components for telecommunications, thus 
positing itself as a challenger of AT&amp;T, which currently has 
15 
percent of the world market, and Japan's NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, 
and Mitsubishi (between 10 and 12 percent), and finds itself 
running neck and neck with Hewlett Packard (8 to 10 percent) and 
outdistancing Ericsson and Northern Telecom (5 percent each). In 
the minds of Alcatel Optronics's management, the objective is 
clear: Within 5 years, 20 to 30 percent of its sales must be 
outside of the group. This will double its revenue. 
  In the optoelectronic components sector, as in that of 
conventional semiconductors, one of the factors making for 
success is large-scale production. 
<H5>  Nozay's Production Capacity To Be Quintupled </H5>
  In April, the first optoelectronic components will be 
rolling 
off of Alcatel Optronics's ultramodern Nozay plant's production 
lines. Although its capacity is still being kept secret, the 
unit's 6,000 square meters--with its 140 employees--is virtually 
certain to enable the company to quintuple its present 
production rate. For this site, with its Class-100 clean rooms, 
the engineers have chosen a process using slices of 
organometallic compounds (InPAsGa) 50 mm in diameter instead of 
the 12.5 mm wafers previously used. This will enable the 
manufacture of 12,000 lasers on each slice. After being 
produced, assembled, then tested, these laser semiconductors, 
photodetectors, and optical amplification modules will be used 
in fiber-optic transmission systems, both terrestrial and 
underwater. The components that will constitute the heart of the 
optical PABX's, on which the group is currently working, will 
also be produced at Nozay.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Jolivet: "... and Joins Globalstar"] </F>
  [Text] Alcatel is positioning itself for the 
telecommunications of the third millennium. The French group 
will be among the number of investors in the future satellite 
communications system Globalstar. 
  Seated together with the American firms Pactel and Qualcomm, 
Italy's Alenia, Germany's Deutsche Aerospace, Great Britain's 
Vodaphone, and Korea's Dacom and Hyundai, at the 
1.6-billion-franc [Fr] round table being hosted by the American 
firm Loral (35 percent), Alcatel is contributing Fr200 million 
for an 11-percent share. 
  The project, whose total cost will exceed Fr10 billion, 
calls 
for using 48 satellites in low orbit. Globalstar will offer 
voice and data transmission, telescopic, and location and 
tracking services, all to be accessible by fixed and mobile 
terminals from any point on the planet. It is expected to be 
operational in 1998 and to have 10 million subscribers within 10 
years from then. 
  Alcatel, the world's number one in telecommunications, could 
not afford to remain on the sidelines in the face of the 
large-scale alliances that are being forged. Satellite networks 
are one of the stakes in the mobile telephony battle of the 
coming years. Motorola has rallied some 20-odd groups worldwide 
around its Iridium project. Microsoft and McCaw Cellular have 
recently announced their Teledesic project. 
  By joining Globalstar, the French group is strengthening the 
American positions it has already gained by way of joint 
ventures. Since 1991, Alcatel has been working together with 
Loral within its subsidiary Space Systems/Loral, in which 
Alcatel acquired a 49 percent stake together with Italy's 
Alenia. Alcatel also operates a company, Euteltrac, which it 
owns jointly with Qualcomm, in the satellite locating and 
tracking sector. 
  Industrially, Alcatel will be responsible for designing and 
producing the payloads to be carried aboard Globalstar 
satellites. These amount to 45 percent of the cost of the 
satellites, and their production will be spread over a period of 
four years. 
  This will ensure an ongoing workload at Alcatel's Toulouse 
plants at a time when orders from European manufacturers are at 
a low ebb. 
<H5>  Major Projects Worldwide </H5>
  Globalstar: 48 satellites to be launched into 
orbit beginning in 1998. Loral and eight groups will invest Fr10 
billion. 
  Iridium: 66 satellites to be in service beginning 
in 1998. Motorola and 20 groups will invest Fr20 billion. 
  Teledesic: 840 satellites to be in service 
beginning in 2001. A joint Microsoft-McCaw Cellular project at 
an estimated cost of approximately Fr52 billion. 
  Odyssey: Under preparation by TRW. 
  P21: Under preparation by Intelsat.

<F P=106> [Article by Ulla Karlsson: "Ultrarapid Transistor Raises </F>
Band Frequency to the Highest Level;" initial paragraph is NY 
TEKNIK introduction] 
  [Text] The key to the communications network of the future 
exists at Chalmers. An extremely fast transistor which becomes 
the building block of tomorrow's wireless communications system. 
It opens the door to an infinity of unutilized frequency bands, 
band which all lie above 20 gigaherz, where one will be forced 
to communicate in the future. 
  A transistor which works at a frequency of 380 gigaherz. 
That 
is the result of eight years of research at Chalmers Institute 
of Technology in Goteborg. Here is one of the world's best 
research groups on high-speed electronics. A group which during 
the last six years has created 10 generations of the fastest 
transistor type HFET (Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor). 
HFETs which through new material combinations and refined 
lithography methods (methods of writing the pattern lines from 
which circuits are made, have become increasingly faster with 
each generation. 
<H5>  380 Gigaherz </H5>
  "A few months ago we arrived at limiting frequencies of 380 
gigahertz," says Herbert Zirath, a researcher at the department 
for microwave technology. "I did not think that was possible a 
few years ago." 
  These rapid transistors can now become the solution to a 
problem that is difficult to solve in today's communications 
society--the lack of frequencies. Because regardless of how blue 
the sky looks, it is jampacked with carrying frequencies. 
Frequencies which bring television images, radio, mobile 
telephones and a great deal more. Up to 1 gigahertz it is really 
crowded, then it thins out a little, after which an ocean of 
free frequencies spreads out above 20 gigahertz. This is where 
international standards organizations now want to place the 
links to the mobile communications networks of the future, 
wireless local data networks and new services such as video on 
demand. But that is easier said than done. Completely new 
high-frequency components that can be mass produced and new 
monolithic circuits are needed in order to develop circuits 
which work in the millimeter wavelength range. 
  This is where the transistor at Chalmers enters the picture. 
With the transistor as a building block new circuits for 
communication in the gigahertz range have already seen the light 
of day. Among them are, for example, a hybrid circuit in which 
the researchers have used an HFET as a resistive frequency mixer 
up to 120 gigahertz. This is something they alone in the world 
have achieved. Other research groups have only achieved 35 
gigahertz. 
  The mixer is part of a whole family of circuits which the 
researchers are now working with, a family which together will 
create a combined sender/receiver for the 55-gigahertz 
frequency. It would, for example be possible to use it as a 
digital radio link connecting base stations in a future 
telephone net. Here the researchers are working with Ericsson 
Radar and with financial support from Nutek. 
<H5>  Even Higher </H5>
  The Chalmers researchers are also moving even higher up in 
the frequency range. On behalf of the Swedish Space Corporation 
they are developing an HFET-based receiver for radioastronomy. 
It is to work in the 119 gigahertz frequency and be installed in 
the Swedish satellite Odin, a satellite which according to plans 
is to be launched in the year 1997. 
<H5>  Compact Design </H5>
  But if equipment for satellites can be permitted to be 
expensive, the same does not apply for equipment to be used 
publicly. Instead, it involves compact design in combination 
with large volumes, which in turn result in low prices. The 
Chalmers researchers, together with researchers at the 
University of Michigan, have found a solution to that problem. 
As the first research group in the world they have integrated a 
slot aerial with an HFET mixer and a lens. 
<H5>  Monolithic Integration </H5>
  The group is now working intensely on integrating 
transistors 
and circuits on one and the same semiconductor chip, so-called 
monolithic integration. Through the integration it will now be 
possible to generate and amplify signals on the same circuit, 
something which in turn makes it possible to build a monolithic 
amplifier on a single chip. Yes, perhaps even with a combined 
sender/receiver on one chip. This in turn yields compact 
equipment and the possibility of mass production, with lower 
prices as a result. 
  "While manufacturing the HFETs we have today arrived at more 
than 90 percent flawless circuits. And that is what is needed in 
order to manufacture integrated circuits," says Herbert Zirath. 
<H5>  A High-Frequency World </H5>
  The fast transistors which have been developed at Chalmers 
Institute of Technology can be used for the following, among 
others: 

  -  Radio links which can be used for telecommunication 
in cities where fiberoptics are difficult to install (60 GHz), 
communication systems for cars and trains and wireless data 
networks in offices. 
  -  Radar applications as intelligent speed 
controls in cars (77 GHz), three-dimensional images of radar 
targets, landing systems for aircraft during poor visibility (94 
Ghz) and phase-controlled antennas. 
  -  Instruments such as 
receivers with low intrinsic noise for radioastronomy (119 Ghz). 
  -  Fiberoptic communication with a speed of 40 gigabits per 
second. The transistor can then be used to build laser 
modulators, optical receivers and circuits which pick out the 
clock concealed in the bit stream.

<F P=106> [Article by Markus Schnurpfeil: "Avalanche Triggered in </F>
Digital Communications: Europe's ISDN Standard Throws the 
Communications Market in Full Swing"] 
  [Text] Horst Gellert, normally a low-key manager, permitted 
himself to voice some uncharacteristic emotional words. "A new 
milestone in the long history of communications has now been 
reached." And the business director of Telekom, the German Post 
Office Department's commercial affiliate, exlaimed that "a new 
age for reckoning time has begun, namely, `before ISDN' and 
after ISDN.'" 
  The reason for Gellert's glowing words was clear. Network 
users in 20 European countries celebrated the official 
introduction of the European Standard for ISDN (Integrated 
Services Digital Network) with a communications party. While up 
to this point the digital networks in Europe had operated on the 
basis of interim national standards, the bits and bytes now race 
through the copper wires and light waveguides on the basis of 
the European Unified Norm (abbreviated E-DSS1). 
  Network operators and the communications industry hope to 
receive the same effect from the Euro-ISDN that was received 
from the GSM-Standard--the technical regulatory structure for 
digital radiotelephony. The simple formula for success lies in 
the fact that a unified Euro-Standard creates a large sales 
market for end products, while the high volume of items pushes 
the prices down, which in turn attracts additional users. As 
Gellert effusively puts it: "With this development, the old 
world takes its place at the top of an advanced technology par 
excellence and can now harvest the economic uses from it." 
  But the Telekom-man will have to be a bit patient. In the 
short term, Euro-ISDN is highly unlikely to find the same 
dynamically growing demand for its products as was realized in 
the mobile radio business. Volker Fink, Telekom's technical 
director responsible, among other things, for ISDN marketing, 
states soberly: "It will take a year before the effects of the 
common Standard will be noticed in the market." 
  Fink's evaluation is totally realistic for the simple reason 
that all the essential elements in the ISDN picture blend 
together very slowly. Only the beginnings of a large end product 
market now exist. To date, digital communications connections 
have only been properly marketed in Germany, where Telekom has 
expanded the ISDN network, at least in the former FRG, and has 
sold more than 300,000 so-called ISDN bases and about 20,000 
primary multiplex connections for linking up large 
communications facilities. The trend is for further strong 
increases. Fink notes: "The other net operators have yet to 
trigger a similar development." 
  At any rate, the communications companies are working toward 
that end. "The European network operators are determined to move 
the Euro ISDN forward," Eckhard Oberfrank, ISDN specialist in 
the Dortmund office of the ExperTeam Telecom consulting firm, 
observes. Still, not all the obstacles have as yet been removed. 
"One of the bottlenecks," Oberfrank laments, "is the fact that 
the producers in each European country still need their own 
country's approval to have their products, like Fax machines and 
modems, connected to computers." 
  This is not only time-consuming, but it is expensive as well 
because of the necessary approval fees. The tedious approval 
procedures have had a definite effect on product price, 
especially in the case of simple Euro ISDN telephones. As one 
specialist in the industry notes: "In the case of the 
telephones, every additional cost added affects the price the 
consumer must pay." 
  Such adversities do not dampen the enthusiasm of the Euro 
ISDN champions however. "The Standard has triggered an avalanche 
that continues to gain momentum," Martin Storp, marketing 
director at Philips Communications Industry AG in Nuremberg, is 
pleased to report. He believes that the producers of equipment 
for digital communications are "finally on the way to profitable 
mass production with the concomitant favorable effect on end 
product prices." Industry specialists estimate that in four to 
five years, an adapter card for the PC will cost only 80 German 
marks [DM]. Storp observes further that "each PC will then be 
able to participate in telecommunications." At least DM500 would 
have to be invested today in order to be able to use this 
additional capability. 
  Despite the Euro Norm, however, no further large price 
reductions can be expected for medium and large communications 
facilities. The sharp competition, which companies like Siemens, 
Philips, Alcatel SEL, and Telenorma have brought to this market 
segment in recent years, has already pushed the prices for large 
systems well below the profitable level. "There is no more room 
for maneuver in that regard," Storp laments. 
  But the situation vis a vis small Euro ISDN systems is quite 
different. Telekom's Volker Fink recognizes that "there is a 
considerable need for action in the matter of small businesses 
and the self-employed." Although not connected to large 
production figures, the price spiral downwards continues 
markedly for smaller systems. With the Eumex minisystem, which 
manages up to eight extensions, Telekom brings to the market a 
Euro ISDN switching system at the competitive price of less than 
DM1000. Pleased by this Telekom development, consultant 
Oberfrank notes that "previously a terminal adapter, which could 
only connect a single analog telephone to the digital network, 
had cost that much." 
  And developments in other companies are also brightening the 
scene. Software giant Microsoft, for example, has now designed 
its successful 'windows for workgroups' program with a software 
module for access to the ISDN network. Oberfrank is convinced 
that this would never had happened if purely national ISDN 
standards still prevailed. 
  Despite these promising business prospects, the high spirits 
prevailing among the suppliers of ISDN circuit boards for 
personal computers, like AVM GmbH of Berlin, mbp Software &amp; 
Systems GmbH of Dortmund, and ITK GmbH of Dortmund, are clouded. 
Regardless of the unified regulatory system, industrial policy 
'trench warfare' threatens this lucrative market segment. It is 
being fought out at the technical level. With the so-called CAPI 
(Common Application Programmable Interface), almost all the 
producers of ISDN PC cards and communications software are now 
able to combine the hardware and the application programs of the 
various suppliers. A Euro ISDN version of this industry standard 
is already available. 
  However, mainly because of massive French influence and 
insistence, another, clearly technically inferior solution is 
being pushed along at the European standardization institute 
ETSI in Nizza. "Now that we finally have the European ISDN 
Standard, the French have nothing better to do than block the 
open market and try to protect its own industry. 
  The ISDN boom in Germany is clearly indicated by the number 
of base connections sold yearly. In 1991, 59,071 such 
connections were sold, in 1992, it was 138,831, in 1993, 
281,254, in 1994, the number is expected to be 480,000, and in 
1995, 800,000.

  [Excerpts] It seems inoffensive but it isn't. It seems to 
be a toy plane, but surely it isn't that either. It could be 
everything but a component of the modern warfare arsenal, and, 
still, the robot plane SOJKA-III TV, a recent 
Czech-Slovak-Hungarian joint development, is partly just that. 
It is not inoffensive because, in fact, this aircraft represents 
a fighting technology of mainly offensive characteristics. 
[passage omitted] It could (if needed) carry 20 kg of 
explosives. [passage omitted] 
  The Czech-Slovak-Hungarian robot plane can be used for 
peaceful applications also. Thus, SOJKA-III TV will be capable 
of performing aerial mapping, harvest status evaluation, damage 
assessment following natural disasters, radiation measurement 
over nuclear power stations and chemical detection over polluted 
industrial areas. [passage omitted] 
  Designing the craft began in 1988. The prototype performed 
its maiden flight in 1990. Experimentation with it continued in 
1991. This robot plane is only one of the elements belonging to 
the reconnaissance/hit (battle) group. The other elements are: 
mobile control and information processing station, launching 
installation, meteorological field unit, special auto-support 
and recovery vehicles. 
  The group's navigation and guidance system is installed 
partly on the aircraft and partly on the mobile control and 
information processing station. The aircraft is provided with an 
automatic pilot, which ensures the plane's navigation and 
"piloting" on the prescribed course. On the plane's board are 
also: a transmission/reception station, a telemeter (distance 
measuring device) and a video camera. 
  The mobile control and information processing station 
displays flight parameters and the craft's course on the 
electronic terrain map, updated through information relayed by 
the video camera and the craft's other sensors. All information 
may be recorded as well. 
  The reconnaissance, as well as all the robot-plane's other 
sensors may be replaced as adapted to mission specifics. To 
this end, the builders had provided the craft with a wide range 
of devices to be accommodated within the 64 cubic decimeter 
space on board for this purpose. 
  SOJKA-III TV may fly on a preprogrammed course or it may be 
remote-controlled from the ground. The craft, according to its 
main performance characteristics--shown below--can be considered 
superior when compared to a relatively large variety of this 
type found in modern military arsenals. Other characteristics, 
qualities, performance or even "weaknesses" have not been 
published. With this type of technology these could be very 
important. Whatever else it might be said, the five Czech-Slovak 
and the eight Hungarian firms that collaborated in developing 
the group, under the guidance of military specialists, produced 
a military technology indispensable to modern 
warfare. 
  Wingspan - 4.1 m 
  Length - 4.125 m 
  Weight - 130 kg 
  Engine power - 31 kW 
  Flight autonomy - 3h 
  Range - 50 km at 600 m, and 100 km at 2,000 m 
  Cruising speed - 120-180 km/h 
  Maximum speed - 230 km/h 
  Flight altitude - 50-2,000 m 
  Useful load - 20 kg.

  [Text] "Szocske" (Grasshopper) the fantastically baptized 
all-terrain light military vehicle has been developed, based on 
the similar American vehicle's success in the Gulf War, at the 
private company of Laszlo Jeno, a former department chief within 
the military industry establishment. A component of the MP's 
(Hungarian Army's) long range planning, the development will go 
into series production not earlier than 1995. MH approved the 
plans--selected through bidding--in 1991. The 40-employee Gepfet 
company built the first prototype at a time when Laszlo Jeno was 
still state secretary in the defense ministry. "Presently", 
Laszlo Jeno informed us," the firm is building three more 
prototypes equipped with diverse options." Then he added: "in my 
estimation this all-terrain vehicle with a Volkswagen engine, 
fit also for civilian use, would cost at today's prices from 
2-to-3 million forints." According to Army experts, development 
of the prototype had cost 6 million, while Laszlo Jeno estimates 
all development expenses to be around 30 million forints; 40 
percent contributed by his own company, 20 percent each by Raba, 
Malev and Technoimpex, the owners of Gepfet, and the rest from 
credits.

Cyprus Telecommunications Authority: "High-Tech Cyprus Networks 
the World"] 
  [Text] Due to its geographical location Cyprus has often 
been considered as a stepping stone between Europe, Asia and 
Africa and has for thousands of years been a meeting place for 
people living and travelling in this part of the world. 
  The island's geographical position assumes an even greater 
importance nowadays. Enhanced by the excellent 
telecommunication services offered by the Cyprus 
Telecommunications Authority (CYTA), as well as by other, 
specialised services offered to the business community, offshore 
companies and businesses have been attracted to Cyprus and the 
island has established itself as the most attractive business 
centre in the region and a telecommunications centre of advanced 
technology. 
  It is widely accepted that no contemporary business 
enterprise can be successful in today's demanding business world 
without efficient, advanced and reliable telecommunications 
facilities. 
  Recognising this, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority 
has 
invested heavily in upgrading the telecommunications network, 
enhancing the quality and expanding the range of services 
offered to satisfy the growing needs of its customers. 
  The result has been the establishment of an excellent 
telecommunications infrastructure and the provision of reliable 
and efficient telecommunications services both nationally and 
internationally. 
  In Cyprus, the contribution of telecommunications in the 
general effort to reactivate the economy after the tragic events 
of 1974, has been particularly significant. 
  Subscribers in 197 countries, or about 99% of the 
world's 
telephones, can be accessed automatically from Cyprus, while the 
rest of the world can be reached through the operator. Telefax 
service is available to all countries operating such a service, 
while telex and telegraph services are provided to virtually 
every country in the world. New value-added services, such as 
audiotex and videoconferencing have been recently introduced. 
  Data transmission locally or overseas is effected either 
through the public, switched telephone network and 
point-to-point leased circuits, or via the Packet Switched 
Public Data Network (CYTAPAC), which uses sophisticated 
switching technology and ensures reliable and secure transfer of 
data. Private leased circuits are also available for voice, 
text and video applications. 
  A cellular mobile telephone service, operating at 900 MHz, 
with an area coverage of more than 90% of the island, and 
an 
island-wide automatic radiopaging service are also offered. 
  CYTA also provides a range of maritime services, enabling 
communication between land-based establishments and ships at 
sea, as well as a variety of services and facilities to third 
parties. 
  The authority, in its continuous drive for excellence has, 
since 1986, been expanding its network and gradually replacing 
analogue facilities with digital switching and transmission 
systems which are considered state-of-the-art technology. By 
the end of 1993 the capacity of the switching network was about 
65% digital, while the digital transmission network 
constituted 
about 90% of the total. 
  The density of telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants 
currently stands at about 52, which compares favorably with 
European countries advanced in telecommunications, while the 
figure of 65 is targeted for 1997. 
  Today, Cyprus is primarily connected with the rest of the 
world via six satellite earth stations and three analogue 
submarine cables which form a highly reliable and flexible 
network. 
  One of the authority's main aims is to establish Cyprus as a 
center of telecommunications in the Eastern Mediterranean region 
to support the government's objective of turning Cyprus into an 
ideal services center and information hub. With this in mind, 
the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority has entered into 
agreements with Greece, Israel, Syria and Lebanon for the 
establishment of fiber optic submarine cable systems connecting 
these countries with Cyprus and through it with the rest of the 
world. 
  The Cyprus-Israel cable (CIOS) has already been installed 
and 
will be ready for service early this year. The tender for the 
construction of the Cyprus-Syria link (UGARIT) was recently 
awarded and the cable is expected to be ready for service by 
November this year. 
  Tenders have also been invited for the Cyprus-Lebanon cable 
(CADMOS) which is expected to become operational in March 1995. 
  The contract for a fourth fiber-optic submarine cable 
connecting Cyprus with Greece (APHRODITE 2) was awarded early in 
1993. This cable is expected to be ready for service by 
September this year. Another cable, an extension of the 
Cyprus-Greece cable, will be laid between Greece and 
France--CYTA will be a major co-owner in this system. 
  A fifth fiber-optic cable connecting Cyprus with Egypt 
constitutes part of the SEA-ME-WE 2 submarine, fiber-optic 
cable, an extensive system stretching from Singapore across the 
Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and ending at Marseilles. 
  When completed in July this year, SEA-ME-WE 2, covering more 
than 18,000 kilometers, will be the longest fiber-optic, 
submarine cable laid to date. Cyprus Telecommunications 
Authority is participating in the construction of the cable 
system as a co-owner, with 53 other parties. 
  In line with the policy of establishing Cyprus as an 
information hub in the eastern Mediterranean region, the 
authority entered into an agreement with Russian organisations 
providing for the establishment of a satellite link between the 
two countries. 
  The agreement also provides for the routing of 
telecommunications traffic originating from Russia, as well as 
from other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
through Cyprus to the rest of the world and vice versa. The 
link will be used for telephony, data transmission, telefax, 
videoconferencing, etc. 
  At the same time, CYTA is proceeding speedily with the 
introduction of new services, using state-of-the-art technology, 
so as to meet market demand. 
  Among these services are the Pan-European Paging System 
ERMES, expected to operate in 1994; the Pan-European Cellular 
Mobile Telephone System (GSM) and an integrated Services Digital 
Network (ISDN) to be introduced in 1995, as well as a number of 
value-added services such as videotex, electronic mail, message 
handling system X.400 and voicemail in the 1994-1995 timeframe. 
  It is evident that the advanced, reliable and efficient 
telecommunications services offered by the Cyprus 
Telecommunications Authority, as well as its ambitious plans for 
the future, place Cyprus among the world's developed countries 
in this field and render it an ideal business center in the 
Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East region.

<F P=106> [Article by JB: "High-Performance Materials Can Be Analyzed </F>
With Fluorine Gas"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Chemical analysis presents problems when 
high-performance materials are to be studied for potential 
impurities. The special properties of these materials, such as 
high temperature resistance, hardness, corrosion and wear 
resistance, make sample digestion difficult. The Max Planck 
Institute (MPI) for Metal Research (Bunsen-Kirchhoff-Strasse 13, 
44139 Dortmund) has developed an alternative digestion method, 
which works with fluorine gas as digesting agent. 
  As reported by Rainer Garten of the MPI, gaseous fluorine is 
suitable for many reasons for digesting resistant materials. The 
gas reacts with many materials as early as temperatures between 
400 and 600ë C, and it can be purified by distillation. The 
fluoridation products created in the digestion are volatile and 
can therefore be studied with gaseous analysis systems. Despite 
these advantages, sample digestion with fluorine has been little 
used so far. This is due to the difficult handling of the 
elements which reacts very easily and to the so far still 
limited availability of pure fluorine. Now, however, the element 
can be produced in sufficient quantity and purity. 
  The digestion takes place in an apparatus made of pure steel 
and monel. The reactor, in which the fluorine gas reacts with 
the sample, is of pure nickel. Fluorine combines with the nickel 
into a nickel fluoride protective layer resistant up to a 
temperature of 700ë C, which protects the reactor material. 
  The fluorine gas, condensed through cooling with liquid 
nitrogen, is added to the reactor through vacuum pumps. 
Subsequently, the reactor is heated to between 400ë and 
600ë and the sample digested. In so doing the pressure in 
the reactor increases up to 12 bar. The fluorine-containing 
reaction gases are drawn off through a titanium dioxide 
absorber. The fluoridated reaction products can then be analyzed 
according to the degree of their volatility. Fluoridated 
nonmetals and semiprecious metals are often volatile and can be 
analyzed with spectrometry methods. Most fluoridated metals are 
not volatile and are analyzed after dissolving them in mineral 
acids. 
  Digestion with fluorine has proved itself particularly for 
analyzing content materials. Studying purity is especially 
important for this group of materials, since the properties of 
the ceramics is greatly influenced by impurities. 
  Conventional digestion methods are either very 
time-consuming 
or falsify the analysis through impurities which occur during 
the digestion process. But other materials, such as glasses, 
ferobor, cast iron, plasma spray powder and tantalum silicate, 
can also be successfully digested with the Dortmund method, it 
is reported.

  [Text] The Institute for Materials Research of the German 
Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) in Cologne-Porz works with 
the extremely high temperatures of the gas stream in aircraft 
jet engines. When the turbine blades of modern jet engines are 
surrounded by a not quite 0.3-millimeter thick thermal 
insulation layer of zirconium oxide, the gas temperatures from 
the combustion chambers can be further increased. This is almost 
the melting temperatures of the turbine blades, which are firmly 
attached to the turbine axis, however, and thus can also 
transmit heat. 
  The goal is now 1,500ë for the gas temperature; each 
150ë increase raises the efficiency of the turbine by about 
six percent and correspondingly reduces the fuel consumption and 
generation of pollutants. The DLR researchers do not take into 
account the cooling of the blades, for example by circulating 
cool air, since the power gain is then largely eliminated. 
  When you surround the blades which are under extreme thermal 
stress with thermal insulation in order to prevent the flow of 
heat to the metal, the difference between gas and metal 
temperatures can be further increased. Then, however, the 
adhesion of the protective layer determines the life of the 
turbine; if the layer peels off, there is total damage. Using 
so-called electron-spring jet-vaporization facilities the DLR is 
trying to overcome the poor evaporation ability of certain 
elements such as silicon and to enrich materials which increase 
layer adhesion in the insulation layers. 
  The constant race between thermal material resistance and 
higher gas temperature is not unique for jet engines. It began 
with the first steam engines which drained the mines and in so 
doing burned at low steam temperatures a large part of the coal 
that was mined. It was evident even at that time that the 
efficiency of a thermal power machine is greater the higher the 
temperature difference between the working gas and the outside 
temperature.

  [Text] Diamond films will control a market of 
billions by the year 2000 in abrasion protection, electronics 
and optics. The prerequisite: a way must be found to produce 
homogeneous films covering a large area more quickly and 
cheaply. 
  The first diamond synthesis using ordinary graphite was 
accomplished by brute force. In the 1950s, researchers from the 
giant American company General Electric used temperatures of 
2,000ë C and 50,000 atmospheres of pressure to produce 
artificial diamonds. This process predominated for a long time. 
In 1990, 350 billion carats or 70 tons of diamonds, valued at a 
billion dollars, were produced using this method. 
  But there are more elegant ways to do it. As early as the 
end 
of the 70's, a team around Prof. Dimitri Fedosseyev at Moscow 
University had done pioneering work on low-pressure diamond 
synthesis. "The technological arrogance of the West prevented us 
from taking the Russian work seriously," admits Ralph-Juergen 
Peters, coordinator of the BMFT program for diamond synthesis. 
  Only the Japanese paid any attention to the pioneering feat. 
They rapidly modified the process and protected it with a wall 
of 500 patents. 
  In CVD (chemical vapor deposition) technology, carbonaceous 
gas is exposed to high temperatures at low pressures in the 
presence of hydrogen and deposited as a thick layer of 
polycrystalline diamond on suitable substrates. 
  For a few years nothing happened to disturb this process. It 
was not until the 1980's that the international professional 
world recognized the true potential of this technology and its 
possible applications. Intensive efforts at further development 
began. 
  Numerous suppliers in Japan and the U.S. are working on the 
development of processes and marketable products. Companies and 
governments all over the world have invested several hundreds of 
millions of dollars. One catalyst is the hope of being able to 
replace silicon as material substrate with diamond film, at 
least in part. But at the moment the bulk of the products 
manufactured with the CVD process are offered in the classical 
diamond areas: machine cutting and optics. 
  The diamond conglomerate De Beers has been on the bandwagon 
since the mid-80's. After fundamental experiments in 
Johannesburg, "several million pounds sterling" were invested in 
England, according to Dr. James Campbell, chief of the 
industrial diamond department. The pilot CVD plant on the Isle 
of Man was transformed into a production plant. But "because of 
the stiff competitive situation," Campbell is unwilling to 
reveal any details about the costs, capacity or processes of the 
reactors, which have been in use since last June. 
  In the Fraunhofen Institute for Film and Surface 
Technologies, IST, Dr. Matthias Fryda and Dr. Claus-Peter Klages 
succeeded in developing a process, which has already been 
patented. In this process the hydrogenating gasification of coal 
makes it possible to produce diamond films both economically and 
ecologically. Traditional plants have up to 100 liters of 
processing gas flowing through them per minute. The gas 
generally consists primarily of hydrogen, with a small 
percentage of hydrocarbons, of which again only a part 
contributes to diamond growth. The residual hydrocarbons and all 
the hydrogen are blown into the open air. 
  In the process developed in Hamburg "in contrast, the waste 
gas is reprocessed in a closed circuit with the help of hot 
activated charcoal," according to Dr. Lothar Schaefer of the 
IST. "No gas is used up or released into the environment during 
film production." The process (in outline) provides for the 
breakup of the hydrocarbons which hinder diamond deposit, and it 
supplies the necessary methane concentrations for film 
production. A special property of the process is that under 
given pressure and temperature conditions a definite 
hydrogen-carbon gas mix is always produced in the carbon 
reactor, even when other oxygenated or inert gases are added 
which encourage diamond separation. 
  The process is still rather exotic: the German scientists 
achieved their best results to date with a coal produced from 
coconut shells. It makes gas streams of up to 25 liters per 
minute and kilogram possible. Japanese researchers initially 
chose their national drink, sake, as the starting point for 
their diamonds.

  [Text] The BMFT [Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology] is providing about 270 million German marks up to 
1997 for development of new laser sources and applications. The 
new "Laser 2000" research focus is intended to speed up the 
generational change from tube (gas lasers) to semiconductor 
technology (diode lasers) in Germany. The main thrust of the 
program is: basic research for new generations of lasers, 
precision machining using lasers, new applications, and laser 
medicine. Work on the pilot project on high-power diode lasers 
has already begun with leading participation of Jenaoptik. 
According to Dr. Werner Gries of BMFT, the goal is to develop a 
small high-power, low-maintenance laser that is usable in a wide 
range of products.

Superhard Diamond and Cubic Boron Nitride Films"; Subheads: "New 
Technologies to Enhance Tool and Component Efficiency"; "Diamond 
Coating of Steel Still Not Feasible"] 
  [Text] Munich -- The harder drills and cutting tools are, 
the longer they last and the more accurately they function. It 
is mostly sufficient to coat the surfaces with hard films. That 
saves costly basic material. Using new physical and chemical 
deposition processes it is now even possible to enhance the 
physical limits of hardness: diamond, the hardest substance in 
the world, can be deposited as a thin film on tools. Such new 
film processes for hard metals have been developed successfully 
in recent years in Germany as well. It is the intention of a new 
research project to extend them to steel tools. Until now there 
are still no superhard films for the processing of ferruginous 
metals, and diamond is not suited for such a purpose. The 
hardest alternative is boron nitride. It is the aim of another 
combined project of the Federal Ministry for Research and 
Technology [BMFT] to vacuum metallize it as a thin film. By 
combining diamond films and cubic boron nitride as a supplement, 
superhard films will become available for all materials and 
categories of application. Such research projects are supposed 
to result in a position of international leadership in the 
application of superhard films. The initial results had been 
displayed at the Hannover Fair. 
  Swift technological development is continually elevating the 
quality and reliability criteria for components. Since the 
surface is of critical importance for the effectiveness of many 
tools, it is mostly enough to alter their properties. Further 
advantages of surface engineering are that energy and material 
can be economized through an appropriate combination of basic 
material and film and substitutes can be had for relatively 
costly basic materials. 
  This is the reason why in recent years the processes 
developed in micro-electronics for the physical (physical vapor 
deposition [PVD]) and chemical (chemical vapor deposition [CVD]) 
deposition of films from the gaseous phase have been extended to 
the coating of all sorts of components and tools. Currently 
coatings are utilized in many engineering sectors: in 
micro-electronics, in the optical industry and even for the 
wearing protection of components and tools. It is the aim of 
these new film technologies to enhance the performance of tools, 
components, machinery and equipment so that companies can 
strengthen their competitiveness in the world's markets. 
  Diamond is an especially attractive material for film 
engineering. Of all known substances diamond is the hardest, it 
is particularly resistant to abrasion and it is chemically 
resistant. Because of its high heat conductivity and its 
excellent optical and electrical properties it is a very 
promising material in the future of micro-electronics. Even the 
most extreme substance, however, has its weak point: at 
temperatures over 500ë C, approximately, diamond reacts with 
oxygen, meaning that the precious crystal burns up. 
  In the early eighties, on the basis of research activities 
in 
the former Soviet Union, Japanese researchers developed 
deposition of polycrystalline diamond films from an active 
gaseous phase at low pressure. Such CVD diamond films turned out 
to be excellent wearing protection for tools and components. As 
a result there was a fresh outbreak of diamond fever, this time 
in scientists' laboratories. According to market research, as 
early as the late nineties, the volume of CVD diamond films for 
tribological applications is likely to swell up to 3 billion 
German marks [DM]. 
  Two unresolved problem areas are being feverishly worked on: 
diamond coating of steel and processing of steels in which the 
diamond films undergo chemical wear because of high carbon 
solubility. 
  Steel is such a critical basic material for tools and 
components that the BMFT has decided to support the "vapor 
deposition [VD] diamond coating of steel." Participating in the 
DM9 million combined project, half of which is financed by the 
BMFT, are the Juelich Nuclear Research Facility [KFA] research 
center as project sponsor, CemeCon limited company [GmbH], 
Aachen, as contract coater, Daimler-Benz corporation [AG], Ulm 
research center, and Siemens AG, Berlin, both of which use steel 
tools in their firms, and tool manufacturer United Hardmetal 
GmbH, Horb am Neckar. Coordination of the research and 
development [R&amp;D] tasking will reside with the Fraunhofer 
Institute for Film and Surface Engineering. 
  The basic R&amp;D tasks to be resolved are: the 
temperatures for 
the diamond deposition have to be lowered to below 500ë C, 
the diffusion processes between the underlying steel body and 
the diamond film have to be attenuated and, lastly, adequate 
bonding of the films has to be realized. 
  The participating industrial users are hoping for a definite 
increase in the effectiveness of tools and components with 
diamond coating and a technical lead over the international 
competition in equipment and machine building and, ultimately, 
as a result, economic advantages. 
  Since there is still an absence of superhard coatings with 
which ferruginous materials can be treated, the BMFT is 
therefore supporting a combined project worth nearly DM10 
million for concurrent research on "cubic boron nitride films." 
  Cubic boron nitride (c-BN) ranks alongside diamond among the 
"superhard" materials. Even the electrical and optical 
properties are similar to those of diamond. Unlike diamond, 
which is subject to chemical wear because of its reaction with 
iron in the processing of steel, cubic boron nitride is 
eminently suited, even at high temperatures, for the processing 
of ferruginous materials. This explains the great interest by 
industry and above all by tool manufacturers in cubic boron 
nitride films. Cubic boron nitride's excellent properties also 
hold forth promising future applications in transportation and 
energy engineering as well as communications engineering and in 
the medical sector. 
  Internationally, however, development in the field of cubic 
boron nitride films is only at the outset. Activities have 
progressed the furthest in Japan and in the U.S. One Japanese 
research group has already succeeded in coating drills with 
cubic boron nitride. But there are still a number of unresolved 
questions that have to be resolved before practical 
implementation. For instance, there is still extensive 
uncertainty about which processes and coating parameters can 
produce cubic boron nitride films that are as free from phase 
shift as possible. 
  Essential to practical use of cubic boron nitride films for 
wearing protection in electronics or optics is their excellent 
bonding. Films of several micrometers' thickness are required 
especially on tools. This problem has still not been resolved 
globally. Currently various interim film bonding agents are 
being tested, but so far this has not resulted in any 
breakthrough. 
  The structure of the combined projects indicates the strict 
industrial orientation of the planned research activities. The 
partners want to realize a position of international leadership 
in industrial applications of superhard films. The decisive 
prerequisite for market success will be the economicalness of 
the coating technologies. The objective is to be well armed with 
supertough films in tough competition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aachen Scientists: High-Precision </F>
Heavy-Duty Lathing"; Subhead: "Using New Method Highly Stressed 
Components Can Be Tooled Even Without Cooling Lubricant"] 
  [Text] Aachen -- Using heavy duty tooling as an alternative 
to conventional production processes, scientists from the 
technical college of Aachen have offered evidence that highly 
stressed components can be tooled even with cooling lubricant by 
using the new method. Norbert Winands and Karl-Friedrich Koch, 
fellow scientists of Professor Koenig (chair and laboratory for 
machine tools and operational instruction and the Fraunhofer 
Institute for Production technology), introduced the new process 
of "heavy duty lathing in lieu of grinding." 
  Whereas cooling lubricant has to be used when grinding, it 
is 
possible even to dry tool hardened steel components, for 
example, with tools of coated hard metal, ceramic cutting 
material and cubic boron nitride [CBN]. Cooling can be dispensed 
with in the case of such cutting materials because of their 
highly elevated temperature hardness and chemical stability. It 
would even produce unfavorable results since cooling could lead 
to temperature stresses that in turn entail micro-splinters and 
edge-notching. Since the absence of cooling can lead to thermal 
deformation, other designs have to be developed to eliminate 
heat in the case of precision tooling. 
  Heavy duty lathing represents a sensible substitute to 
grinding. Not only is complexity decisive for the choice of the 
production process, so are the required dimensional tolerance 
and surface finish of the component. Drawing dies, pressure rams 
and inner-raceway roller bearings are not only exposed to high 
mechanical stresses, but they have to satisfy extreme quality 
standards. Consequently, the production stages of such 
components are costly and numerous. 
  Heavy duty lathing appears an attractive alternative since 
it 
is possible to realize accuracies of International Standards 
Association [ISA] Tolerance [IT] six and surface finishes from 
return to zero [Rz] -- two to three micrometers using dry 
tooling. Such grinding values, however, still are not up to the 
highest precision standards. One significant advantage of dry 
tooling using geometrically defined cutting is doing without 
ecologically questionable cooling lubricant. Acquisition and 
disposal costs have soared, justifying an equivalent replacement 
even in terms of competitiveness. From a production engineering 
optic, the high flexibility of the process yields its most 
important aspect since non-form-bound tools are employed. When 
grinding, for the most part, each tooling operation uses a 
process adapted for it. That is why a number of chuckings are 
frequently required for the tooling. In the case of heavy-duty 
lathing even complex component shapes are produced with a single 
chucking. 
  Such high process flexibility results in shorter throughput 
times and can be used in both small batch production and in mass 
production. Using heavy duty lathing it is currently possible to 
realize dimensional tolerances that previously were reserved for 
grinding. Cases from industry verify that substituting heavy 
duty lathing for grinding can yield not only ecological but also 
economical advantages. As much as a quintupling of basic 
quantity is feasible coupled with definitely shorter production 
times. This even holds true if the costs of disposing of cooling 
lubricants and wheel swarfs are left out of the equation. 
  Fresh and further developments in the production resources 
sector, such as machine tools running on fully hydrostatic 
bearings and magnetic tension designs, in the future, will allow 
final cutting processing of hardened components having 
production tolerances that can currently be realized only with 
cost intensive precision grinding or honing operations. Hence 
heavy duty cutting opens up new prospects for currently proven 
production processes.

<F P=106> [Article by Emmanuel Jullien: "To Make High-Strength </F>
Cylindrical Parts: A 50/50 Aluminum/Ceramic Composite"--first 
paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction] 
  [Text] The method developed by Industrial Bronzes, a 
small to mid-size industry [PMI], yields aluminum-based 
composites with a very high wear resistance. 
  When it manufactures metallic rings and cylinders by 
centrifugation, the PMI Industrial Bronzes kills two birds with 
one stone. Actually, it uses centrifugal force to achieve 
concentrations of up to 50 percent of silicon carbide particles 
in its aluminum parts, over a thickness of its choice, and in 
parts ranging from 80 mm to 2 m in diameter. This is an original 
way of exceeding the 20-percent rate, above which the alloy 
becomes too viscous to be cast. 
  "When silicon carbide concentrations reach 30 percent, the 
aluminum-matrix composite becomes practically insensitive to 
friction, its mechanical performance improves, and it can 
withstand temperatures as high as 300ëC," Luc Lajoye, the 
technical manager, explained. This means a tenfold increase of 
the application range of light-alloy cylinders. Aerospatiale 
already placed a test order for space applications. Sollac also 
decided to subject the alloy to severe testing, using it for an 
electric collector ring immersed in water heated to over 
100ëC. 
  It was after the completion of the Euram BRITE [Basic 
Research in Industrial Technologies for Europe] project, 
completed jointly with the Grenoble National Polytechnic 
Institute (INPG) at a cost of 12 million French francs [Fr] over 
three years, that the PMI developed this knowhow. The 
manufacturer makes an aluminum alloy containing 10 percent of 
silicon carbide, and centrifuges this alloy to mold it into a 
cylinder. Being heavier than aluminum, silicon carbide then 
migrates toward the outer perimeter. There, it accumulates in 
concentrations of 30, 40 and even 50 percent. "By varying the 
temperature and centrifugation rate, we manage to control the 
concentration and thickness of the solidified zone. But we also 
vary the particle size (from 10 to 100 fm) to modify the 
mechanical strength and wear resistance," Luc Lajoye added. 
Another distinctive characteristic is that the parts are 
strengthened both at the surface and throughout their thickness. 
Witness the tests carried out on engine cylinder liners, causing 
silicon carbide to migrate and accumulate in a 5-mm thick 
homogeneous peripheral zone containing 35-percent silicon 
carbide. After the cylinder has cooled, its inside must be 
machined to remove about 10 mm and get down to the strengthened 
zone. "Compared with the `Nicasil' surface treatment (using 
nickel and silicon carbide), the price is divided by two," Luc 
Lajoye assured.

<F P=106> [Sylvestre Huet report: "A New State of Matter"] </F>
  [Text] "Here is the machine," says Alain Perez, indicating 
with a rapid gesture a fat cylinder of polished steel. Dotted 
with metal studded inspection portholes, draped with power 
cables, lit by a flashing green laser beam, and surrounded by 
display monitors, it looks just like any another laboratory. In 
the basement of the Claude Bernard University in Lyons, accessed 
by a narrow corridor, there is nothing to indicate to the 
visitor that what he has before him is a machine unique in 
Europe. Nonetheless, it plays a key role in the study of 
material in grains so small that you can almost count the exact 
number of atoms -- what the experts call aggregate structures. 
This intermediate state of matter, known scientifically as 
mesoscopic, comes between the atom (or the molecule) and the 
larger compact solid. Rich in new properties that probably lie 
at the heart of macroscopic phenomena -- crystal growth, 
conduction, magnetism -- until recently aggregates had been an 
enigma for physicists. Hard to produce -- in small ovens -- 
they had been ephemeral, giving just enough time for a small 
peek and a rapid analysis. Times have changed: physicists have 
now managed to tame them. 
  Here they are produced by a combination of the two extremes 
of very hot and very cold: burning laser shots and cooling jets 
of helium. The heat of the laser is powerful enough to vaporize 
even the most heat-resistant of substances, such as carbon which 
requires a temperature of 4,000ë C. Helium -- or argon -- 
injected at the same frequency as the laser pulses, expands and 
leads to a sudden and violent refrigeration to around 0K 
(-278ë C). The aggregates are thus not given enough time to 
recombine with their neighbors. 
  They are analyzed by their "flight" in the machine. This is 
common practice, and is also used at Lyons to sort them by mass. 
Then, after they have been sorted, the less common practice is 
performed of spreading them out in layers on thin plates. Only 
a few laboratories can do this, notably the AT&amp;T 
laboratories in 
Murray Hill in the United States, and the federal polytechnique 
school in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
  Physicists rarely lack the adjectives to qualify matter: 
"condensed," "soft," and now we have "divided," to use the word 
employed by experts in aggregates and adopted by Michel Broyer. 
Professor, laboratory director, and master in the art of 
analyzing aggregates by the duration of their flight through the 
vacuum, he sums up in one sentence the aim being pursued: "to 
clarify the behavior of matter when it is prevented from forming 
a compact solid." In short, a little pile of atoms -- from 
three or four to a thousand -- of iron, nickel, silicon, cobalt, 
or carbon. Things can also be complicated slightly by using 
piles of assemblies of two types of atom. At a time when nuclei 
are smashed into a thousand pieces to determine their 
constituents, there is still much we do not know about the 
properties that these aggregates could reveal. How are they 
formed? What shapes do they take? What happens to their 
electrons? In thin layers, are they hard or soft, conductive or 
insulating? Will they prove useful for chemists, interesting 
for electronic engineers, or revolutionary in optical 
electronics? Used as projectiles, could these microscopic 
shells destroy a target substance? 
  There are so many questions that the theorists remain rather 
guarded. Verbose on the subject of nuclei, specific on single 
atoms, they have little to say when it comes to this divided 
matter. This is an ideal situation for the three promoters of 
the Lyons pole and their experimental approach that has turned 
up so many surprises. Michel Broyer stresses: "We explore." 
The theorists can calculate the shape of an aggregate of up to 
10 silicon atoms, but more than that, and they can only draw on 
approximate notions or theories for as long as there are not 
enough atoms to speak of a compact solid. Alain Perez is 
director of research at the National Scientific Research Center 
[CNRS], charged with designing and developing the source of 
aggregates in association with the Lyons group. He says: "Few 
predictions are possible in this domain." With his group and the 
group headed by A. Hoareau, the materials expert started the 
adventure with a gamble: No one could say for sure whether the 
aggregates would keep their specific structures and properties 
when they were deposited in layers on a substrate. Would they 
not, rather, "lose the memory" of their violent and imbalanced 
formation and reform as a conventional substance? 
  The last of the three men, Albert Renouprez, leads a team in 
a chemistry lab close to the Claude Bernard University, 
specializing in catalysis. Chemists and aggregates go back a 
long way. The reactors in the oil industry have been using 
aggregates for a long time to crack long hydrocarbon molecules. 
They are commonly used in perfume manufacture and pharmacy. A 
recent CNRS report estimated that at least 20 percent of the GDP 
of the United States is generated from activities relating to 
substances obtained by catalysis. However, their production by 
chemical means -- as a platinum salt deposit on a plate and then 
stripping the salt off -- is certainly efficient, but it remains 
essentially an empirical process. It is difficult, in these 
conditions, to identify the chemical processes at work, and 
especially difficult to invent recipes based on new elements or 
mixed aggregates. Albert Renouprez admits: "We know absolutely 
nothing about the chemical properties of this type of 
aggregate." He has just obtained, using the vaporization 
source, the first samples of mixed platinum and palladium 
aggregates on silicon and graphite substrates. He sees the 
adventure leading to the possibility of working on "model" 
aggregates that could, perhaps, be applied to the catalytic 
exhausts of the future. 
  Michel Broyer leads the way in this exemplary project of 
cooperation. It is his team at the ionic and molecular 
spectrometry laboratory (CNRS/Claude Bernard University) that is 
charged with identifying the aggregates formed in the vacuum 
chamber. The efficiency of the equipment in Lyons has sped up 
the research. When subjected to analysis, the aggregates reveal 
their secrets. 
  In addition to their shapes and construction, physicists are 
interested in the properties of these aggregates. How many 
atoms does a metal need to conduct electricity? There is no 
theoretical answer to this question. 
  Catherine Brechignac of the Aimo-Cotton laboratory in Orsay 
(CNRS coordinator of French teams working on aggregates) and 
Michel Broyer conducted experiments with mercury aggregates in 
the Orsay Lure laboratory for the use of electromagnetic 
radiation to study the transition from insulator to conductor in 
relation to the number of atoms. They saw that as long as there 
are less than 12 atoms, excitation remains limited to just one. 
The "current" -- a shared behavior affecting an electron 
population -- does not flow. From 12 atoms, the interaction 
between them intensifies and their electronic fields 
interconnect. Over 80 atoms, and electrons are knocked out of 
place. However, we need at least 1,000 atoms before we can 
really speak of electrical conduction. Even on this scale, the 
electrical and chemical properties of the aggregates are not 
always the same as those of the solid substance. Going one 
stage further, Michel Broyer is now examining "mixed" 
aggregates, cautiously combining the simplest of metals, 
lithium, with the simplest of atoms, hydrogen. The aggregates 
obtained consist of eight to 15 lithium atoms and one or two 
hydrogen atoms. He has discovered that the latter tend to form 
on the aggregate's surface. 
  While Michel Broyer's team is refining its methods for 
precisely determining the aggregates produced, Alain Perez's 
team has been preparing the plates. After a relatively 
stringent sorting process, these plates capture aggregates at 
the end of their trajectory forming, in one hour, plates of up 
to a thousand angstroms thick over an area of one square 
centimeter. He exclaimed: "What we had hoped for has happened! 
The aggregates retain the memory of how they were formed and 
land unaltered on the substrate. This is a world first that 
opens up a whole new avenue of research." The initial guinea 
pigs were widely reported in the media, including the famous 
fullerenes (assemblies of carbon atoms, some of which -- between 
20 and 60 atoms -- grouped together in little balls or even 
footballs). "In fact we have managed to isolate a whole series 
of families -- from the spherical and never-before seen C20, to 
the C900 -- which we chose because of their specific 
characteristics." 
  Alain Perez talks enthusiastically of "an ideal technique 
for 
producing thin, nanostructured layers." The prefix nano is 
currently the vogue in laboratories, a sure sign of physicists' 
ambition to be able to manipulate matter one atom or one 
molecule at a time. The layers of carbon aggregates are 
organized in piles of spherical particles some 15 to 25 
nanometers in diameter, as seen in atomic microscopes. Alain 
Perez manufactures strange "nano-sponges" on the surface of his 
plates. They combine the perfect order of aggregates at a short 
distance with the disorder of the layer where the aggregates are 
deposited at random. This crystalline/amorphous mixture can 
result in new and interesting electrical, magnetic, and optical 
properties. Alain Perez actually speaks of "new substance." The 
C20 nano-sponges, insulating and transparent, are almost as hard 
as diamond but have less than half the density, making them 
similar in mass to polymers. With aggregates of iron 20, iron 
150, and nickel 200, the magnetic effects of the nanostructured 
layers differ considerably from solid substances. Alain Perez 
talks of a ferromagnetic state midway between amorphous and 
crystalline substances. It is possible that his small packets 
of aggregates, whose magnetism can be controlled, are the 
precursors to future, hyperdense magnetic computer memory. 
  Other teams have shown that nanoporous layers of silicon are 
luminescent in the visible spectrum, although nobody really 
knows why. Will optronics engineers be able to use this 
phenomenon? Alain Perez insists: "Not all these properties 
could be deduced from the properties of aggregates. However, 
the initial experiments on carbon will serve as a reference for 
our future research on silicon." He is looking to build silicon 
aggregates with less than 30 atoms. Some theorists predict that 
they will be compact, with layers more dense than are found in 
solid blocks of the substance, thus producing a new metal 
phase... To summarize expert opinion, the last CNRS economic 
report speaks of the "major stakes" that are represented by thin 
layers of aggregates. 
  Four hundred km from Lyons, another French team has declared 
war with aggregates. Figuratively (since it has just embarked 
two major scientists) and literally, as it aims to accelerate 
aggregates and use them as a shell to bombard matter with. A 
change of scenery, with big machines and warlike vocabulary. On 
the Orsay campus, the physicists working on the Tandem 
electrostatic accelerator -- a blue-colored machine some 30 
meters long, built at the start of the 1970s -- have seized on 
these new projectiles. Accustomed to working with atomic ions, 
their job is to observe the reaction of a bombarded substance 
through the behavior of individual atoms. Using energy of 
around 100 million electron volts, they force the bombarded 
substance to emit ions, or even molecules in the case of organic 
matter, which can then be analyzed for identification. 
  Standing by the blue Tandem machine, supervisor Serge Della 
Negra is almost apologetic: "Of course, we cannot see anything, 
but Orion is in there." Orion lives up to its name. In its 
designer's view, it is a real "spatial manipulation." The 
original and risky idea consisted of introducing an aggregate 
source into the accelerator and leaving it there for several 
months. It has to resist a hostile environment of 
electromagnetic storms and an insulating gas at a pressure of 9 
bars, while obeying the commands relayed by optical fiber. 
Everything is done without the possibility of entering Tandem 
to carry out repairs. Serge Della Negra admits that "the risk 
was that no one could be sure that the aggregates would resist 
the acceleration and not split up." However, it was worth it. 
"At the end of the trajectory we bombard a point of material 
with a huge amount of energy generated by the weight of the new 
projectile." By switching from the ionic atom to the aggregate, 
in effect the physicists swapped a ball for an explosive shell. 
  The first weapons used were C60 molecules, supplied in 
powder 
form by the CNRS's "Mr. Fullerenes," Patrick Bernier. In 1992, 
Serge Della Negra's team surprised everyone using a beam of C60. 
Introduced into the Tandem at 200,000 electron volts, this was 
then accelerated. It passed through a box of nitrogen like a 
kamikaze and ionized to come out the other side at 40 million 
electron volts! Serge Della Negra says: "It is true that we 
lose 999 out of 1,000 C60's in the process, but it is a world 
first, and no theorist could have calculated the interaction 
between C60 and nitrogen." 
  If he sounds jubilant it is because the bombardment obtained 
opens up a whole new perspective. The largest known deposition 
of energy per unit of time and space was performed in the GANIL 
heavy ion accelerator in Caen, using uranium beams. With a beam 
of one billion electron volts, it delivers 3,000 electron volts 
per angstrom, but over hundreds of microns since atomic ions 
penetrate substances easily. On the other hand, C60 aggregates 
cannot slip between atoms and instead cause real explosions on 
the surface of the material. With this experiment, the Orsay 
physicists have nipped in the bud the theory that it is 
impossible to accelerate C60 aggregates in a machine such as the 
Tandem. However, the low yield obtained meant that the problem 
had to be reworked. They then attempted to use gold aggregates, 
so producing the first ever precious metal explosive shells. 
  On 19 November 1993, the Tandem team in Orsay was therefore 
able to post another world first: the acceleration of 
aggregates of three or four gold atoms. Aggregate beams with an 
energy of 10 million electron volts bombarded silicon sheets, 
creating shock waves that changed the crystalline structure of 
the silicon. 
  What can be done with this new technology? Apart from its 
interest from the point of view of basic research, Serge Della 
Negra is convinced that there are other openings: 
"Microelectronics, surface analysis and treatment, 
nanostructures, multipoint bonding, biochemical detectors, etc. 
A number of possibilities can be envisaged, as long as we are 
not restricted to the specific conditions of the physics 
experiment," and, a CNRS report stresses diplomatically, as long 
as French industrial groups do not continue with their "wait and 
see" policy. 
  In the longer term, Serge Della Negra is also thinking about 
thermonuclear fusion. For some time, scientists have been 
searching for a way to prevent the deuterium and tritium nuclei 
from fusing by compressing them (by "inertial confinement") 
using converging laser beams. In a kind of heavy arms race, we 
are moving from photons to protons, and then to atomic ions, and 
finally to aggregates. The heavier the projectile, the more 
violent the impact. "We are still a long way off. However, we 
are getting ready for the time when we will be able to 
accelerate to 10 million electron volts molecules of 100,000 
atoms ionized a hundred times, which would generate a billion 
electron volts in 1,000 angstroms, the scale required to achieve 
fusion." 
  With the successes achieved at Lyons and Orsay, a number of 
teams are starting to perform this type of experiment. 
Researchers have been able to successfully apply the concepts 
of nuclear physics to aggregates. However, Serge Della Negra 
laments: "Divided matter does not have its De Gennes, like soft 
matter." Not yet. 
<H5>  The Geometry of Aggregates </H5>
  Cuboid octahedrons, tetrahedrons, octahedrons, icosahedrons, 
etc. Freed from energy constraints and thus from the constraints 
of the crystalline networks of solid matter, aggregates have 
taken new shapes. The physicist invents assemblies of atoms in 
shapes encountered nowhere else in nature except in interstellar 
space. Michel Broyer has discovered that it is possible to alter 
the shapes produced by altering the pressure of the helium and 
the nozzles that supply it, generating effects that differ 
according to the melting point of the elements. Aggregates of 
more than 100 aluminum atoms prefer octohedrons. Gallium 
aggregates collect in the shape of a drop of liquid, with 
electronic layer effects such as would exist around an enormous 
atom. The Lyons researchers also hold a record: gallium 
aggregates with an outside layer of 7,200 electrons. Indium 
aggregates of less than 200 atoms take up this droplet shape, 
while they resemble aluminum when there are more atoms. Nickel, 
iron, or cobalt aggregates have more rigid shapes. Nickel and 
cobalt, in aggregates of 100 to 900 atoms, adopt an icosahedron 
shape. The aggregates of iron take a number of different shapes. 
<H5>  Breeding Aggregates </H5>
  First take a thin bar, a few centimeters long by a few 
millimeters across. It may be made of ultra-pure iron, cobalt, 
carbon, silicon... in fact the whole of the periodic table is 
available. Placed in a vacuum chamber, this little bar is then 
spun round in the heat of a Yag laser pulsed at a frequency of 
30 Hz. The power of the laser vaporizes some of the material. 
At the same time, synchronized with the laser pulses, a jet of 
helium is pulsed into the vacuum chamber. When it expands, the 
helium immediately cools the vapor which then "freezes" the 
aggregates formed, even if they are far from being in a state of 
energy balance. Carried along at supersonic speed, the ionized 
aggregates are sent to a "flight time" line, where they are 
identified by mass spectrometry. This is the field of research 
of Michel Broyer and his team. When production is known and 
calibrated, the deposition stage commences. After passing 
through a chamber sorting the number of atoms -- applying 
Cornelian selection: the more severe the sorting the fewer 
aggregates remain for deposition -- the aggregates enter a 
deposition chamber. The first type of chamber is used by Alain 
Perez's team in the materials physics department 
(CNRS-university), since their plates often have to withstand 
exposure to air. The second type of chamber, which includes a 
small vacuum "suitcase" protecting the deposit from chemical 
reactions, is used by Albert Renouprez at the Catalysis 
Institute. 
  The only source of aggregates in Europe, this system is 
characterized by a high flow and the ability to deposit on a 
substrate aggregates that have been sorted by mass. It was 
financed by the CNRS, the Claude-Bernard University (Lyons), the 
French research ministry, and the Rhone-Alpes region for 10 
million French francs (1989-1993). The second source, currently 
being installed, will benefit from an acceleration cavity making 
it possible to bombard a target with heavy aggregates with an 
energy of 1,000,000 electron volts.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Shafts Cut Weight by 70 Percent in </F>
Naval Use"] 
  [Text] Shafts made of a new composite material which is 
stronger than steel, reduces the weight up to 70 percent and 
lowers installation and maintenance costs, have been introduced 
by Applied Composites in Linkoping, south Sweden. The new 
composite, made of carbon fibers, aramid and glass fibers, is in 
use in an experimental craft, called Smyge, a stealth vessel for 
the Swedish Royal Navy. 
  Shafts installed in Smyge, which has undergone four years of 
extensive tests, have shown no signs of fatigue. According to 
laboratory tests, shafts made of carbon composites transmit over 
10 times more torque by weight than a steel shaft, or about 
3,300 Nm per kg compared to 150 Nm per kg for a steel shaft. 
Nor is it necessary to change the transmission system for the 
installation of composite shafts which are available in a 
standard production range of 6.5 meters or more in length and up 
to 2 meters in diameter. 
  By combining different types of fibres and varying the 
angles, shafts can be tailor-made for different purposes. Using 
filament winding it is possible to make the composite shafts 
stronger than steel said the company, which is part of the 
Celsius Group, the leading Swedish defense industry. The fibers 
most commonly used are glass, carbon and aramid with epoxy or 
vinylester resin. 
  As composite shafts have a much higher critical speed than 
conventional metal shafts, they can reduce or eliminate the need 
of bearings. 
  Composite shafts are non-corrosive, non-magnetic, 
non-conductive and have higher damage tolerance and reduced 
vibrations. They can be used as drive shafts, wheel shafts, 
rudder shafts and rods. 
  Weight reduction is one of the most important properties of 
the composite shafts; a traditional metal shaft with a weight of 
about 7 tons can for example be substituted by a composite shaft 
weighting approximately 300 to 400 kg.

<F P=106> [75-page 1992 Annual Report from the Luxembourg PTT] </F>
  [Excerpt] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  For the first time, the turnover of the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services has exceeded the 10-billion-franc 
threshold, coming in at 10.35 billion [Luxembourg] francs 
[LuxF], by including projected revenues for paying out returns 
on funds on deposit with the government, representing the assets 
of private third parties with postal checking accounts. 
  If one takes into account the drop in revenues owing to the 
decline in telex use and the reduction in international 
telephone rates, which went into effect on 1 March 1992, it can 
be considered that the growth in gross revenues from 
telecommunications (LuxF7.4 billion, representing an increase of 
5.7 percent) is very favorable within a rather depressed 
economic context, while postal [account] revenues leveled out of 
LuxF2.2 billion. 
  Operating expenses increased by 7 percent, reaching LuxF4.1 
billion including, as in years past, the total amount of 
expenses for retirement pensions. Payments to foreign 
administrative bodies, subject to the exchange rate hazards of 
international accounts, may increase by 28.4 percent, attaining 
a sum of LuxF1.7 billion. 
  Subject to these conditions, the cashflow generated by the 
present exploitation of postal services, of postal financial 
services, and of telecommunications services, is set at LuxF4.3 
billion. The 2.2-percent drop, relative to the preceding year, 
has no profound significance, for the reasons cited above. This 
cashflow level made it possible to finance the investment 
program which, at LuxF2.7 billion (+16.2 percent, has just 
broken all previous records. 
  In order to insure the transition of budget accounting to 
commercial accounting by 1 January 1993, for determining 
allocations for depreciation, the reassessment of the property 
of the new Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise by 
independent experts, within the context of establishing an 
opening balance, was taken into account. In terms of this 
reassessment, the allocation for depreciation may go from 
LuxF765.7 million to LuxF1.848 billion, such that the surplus, 
to be considered as a pre-tax profit beginning in fiscal year 
1993, is being reduced to LuxF2.5 billion. 
  With regard to the lag in telephone connections, accumulated 
over the last few years, significant progress has been made 
during fiscal year 1992. While the number of requests for new 
telephone connections again increased by 3.7 percent to attain a 
figure of 17,677, the waiting list for new service connections 
not feasible owing to technical reasons was reduced by 25 
percent to 2,347 units in late 1992. 
  The noteworthy event in 1992 was surely the vote, on 9 July 
1992, on the part of the Chamber of Deputies, on the draft law 
to amend the status of the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services Administration. This law, dated 10 August 1992, sets up 
the new "Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise," a 
public establishment having a legal character and enjoying 
financial and administrative autonomy. This law went into effect 
on 1 September 1992, the Enterprise thus functioning once again 
within the framework defined by the law regarding the State 
revenues budget and expenses for 1992. The Enterprise has been 
enjoying financial autonomy since 1 January 1993. 
  This reform, while according the new entity the freedoms to 
act which it shall require, at the same time fulfills the 
separation of regulatory and operational functions required by 
European directives, in light of the liberalization of postal 
and telecommunications services. Thus, these services continue 
to be regulated by the laws of 4 May 1877 and 20 February 1884, 
respectively, anticipating amendment of those laws, in 
conformity with European directives currently being drafted. 
  In that context, it ought be mentioned that the Commission 
published a "Green Book Concerning the Development of a Single 
Market for Postal Services," dated 11 June 1992, as well as a 
new "Report Concerning the Status of the Telecommunications 
Services Sector," dated 21 October 1992. In the meantime, the 
session of the Council of Telecommunications Ministers, which 
took place in Luxembourg on 16 June 1993, has given the go-ahead 
for liberalizing the complement of public telephone services, 
slated for 1 January 1998 at the latest. 
  Now, it shall be up to the Enterprise's new managerial 
echelon and the entire personnel staff to again take up the 
challenge of competition while safeguarding the interests of a 
quality public service accessible to all. 
  Luxembourg, 16 July 1993 
  [signed] 
  Edmond 
Toussing, General Manager 
  In 1991, the rapid increase of requests for connection to 
the 
telecommunications network, infeasible owing to the lack of 
available lines in local networks, was the major discernible 
problem. During fiscal year 1992, the measures brought on line 
were intensified and quickly bore fruit. Thus, the number of 
requests pending was reduced by about 25 percent, leveling out 
at 2,300 at year's end. 
  When one deducts from this figure the underground 
connections 
that are pending, because the corresponding building 
construction is not yet completed at the end of 1992, one 
arrives at a figure of 1,703 requests not honored owing to a 
paucity of available lines. It follows that, during 1993, the 
effort should be maintained within these bounds. 
  As regards requests that can be serviced, it has been 
possible to maintain an average lag time of 3 weeks, despite a 
considerable upsurge in the volume of work. For 1993, some 
measures applied to simplify operations and a streamlining of 
procedures shall be brought into play and shall make possible 
even more expeditious service. 
  Within the domain of the interface network, work at 
important 
building sites to be equipped with fiber-optic cable has been 
pursued in such a manner that, at the end of 1992, more than 60 
percent of the centers were already being served via fiber-optic 
cable. 
  The tempo assumed over several years should be maintained 
through the end of the decade in order to keep pace with the 
conversion to digital technology and [state-of-the-art] 
switching and for ensuring a network sufficiently in consonance 
with the goal of guaranteeing sufficient operational security, 
even in the event of a major failure. In this regard, a 
global-level plan has been sketched out and subjected to 
discussion. 
  The number of building sites where the postal and 
telecommunications services are participating, coordinating on 
the initiative of the administrations, public services or 
distribution enterprises, has remained at the same level as over 
the last fiscal year, while the number of residences, large 
buildings and residential developments has continued to grow. 
  In the field of radio communications, efforts geared to 
establishing a directional radio link to Belgium, slated to 
become operational during 1993, have progressed. 
  The prototype configuration of a radio network, using 
near-border resources shared with the FRG, was defined in 1993, 
with an eye toward a 1993 startup under the designation 
"Commobil." It is destined to cover the domestic mobile radio 
communications needs of companies having a fleet of vehicles on 
the move. 
  The LUXGSM network was put into play in such a manner that 
it 
was possible to effect the first few test communications by the 
end of 1992, with an eye toward a commercial-level startup in 
1993. 
  Other radio engineering services such as Semphone and ATF II 
continue to enjoy the favor of the consumers. 
  Finally, during the last quarter of 1992, the 
Telecommunications Division was able to begin its move to the 
new site [called] "Cloche d'Or" [The Golden Bell], leaving 
behind the divers constraints and disadvantages resulting from 
the level of scatter in the train station district. 
<H5>  Telecommunications </H5>
<H5>  I. Telecommunications Infrastructure </H5>
<H5>  1. Local Subscriber Networks </H5>
  Some projects for expanding some of the local networks have 
been implemented in the following areas: 
  Rodange, Alzingen, Fentange, Hesperange, Bertrange, Mamer, 
Capellen, Dudelange, Bettembourg, Esch/Alzette, Oetrange, 
Moutfort, Contern, Senningen, Reckange, Heiderscheid, Reisdorf, 
Garnich, Schuttrange, and Feulen. 
  In Luxembourg and its environs, some expansion projects have 
been implemented in the districts of Gasperich, Siechenhof, 
Dommeldange, Eich and in the Kirchberg Plain. 
  Finally, at the request of property developers, the local 
network was installed in residential districts, in commercial 
zones, artisans' districts or in industrial sectors. Some 
fiber-optic links were implemented in the networks for greater 
Luxembourg, Gare, Belair, and Kirchberg. 
  At present, fiber-optic cabling is used in the local 
networks 
only to the extent that transmission needs exceed the capacities 
of conventional copper conductor cables. Here, it is a question 
of all the digital data rates exceeding 2 MBits/sec, be it for 
the interconnection of computers, image transmission, etc., or 
that the total demand for 2 MBit/sec and n x 64 kBit/sec 
circuits exceeds existing capacities. It is in this context that 
the links cited above were planned and implemented. Since 
several clients needing this sort of gear are often located in 
the same district (Kirchberg, peripheral [commercial] activity 
zones, the downtown area), the formation of veritable islets of 
fiber-optic networks, having a mesh or loop structure offering 
the operational security required for the utilization of this 
type of gear, is at the advanced planning stage. The initial 
implementations are expected in 1993. 
  Moreover, the installation of a local fiber-optic cable link 
was implemented between Wecker and the industrial district of 
Potaaschberg. Two other links, between Bourange and Bettembourg 
and between Belvaux and Sanem, are in the process of being 
implemented, for replacing saturated primary conventional cables. 
<H5>  2. Interurban Networks </H5>
  Within the context of interface cables between centers using 
fiber-optic cables exclusively, the links listed below have been 
brought on-line: 
  Luxembourg-Garnich 
  Luxembourg-Oetrange 
  Burange-Tetange 
  Esch II-Belvaux 
  For the links listed below, preliminary work, viz., 
excavations and the installation of pipelines, has been 
completed and the laying of fiber-optic cables has begun: 
  Consdorf-Echternach 
  Ettelbruck-Heiderscheidergrund 
  In the north of the country, work on the Diekirch-Vianden, 
Diekirch-Beaufort, and Heiderscheidergrund-Neidhasuen links is 
progressing. 
<H5>  3. International Networks </H5>
  The Luxembourg-FRG link via a 140 MBit/sec directional radio 
link was augmented by a supplementary channel so that this link 
can continue to serve as an adjunct to the fiber-optic cable. 
  The installation of a new trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable 
with TAT9 fully digital transmission, comprising 30 MAUO's to 
AT&amp;T, 70 to Teleglobe Canada, 30 to MCI, and 30 to Sprint 
International. 
<H5>  4. Digital [Operations] Centers </H5>
  The investments made during 1992 in the field of telephone 
communications has made it possible to pursue the program for 
the replacement of electromagnetic and electronic switching (old 
generation) with digital switching gear. 
  Along with the progress in replacing outdated switching gear 
with new generation switching equipment, it was possible to 
expand the availability of 2 MBit/sec interface connections to 
most public switching facilities. 
  At the end of 1992, 79 private telephone communications 
centers were connected to this equipment. 
<H5>  II. Telecommunications Services </H5>
<H5>  A. Telephone Services </H5>
<H5>  1. New Service Connections </H5>
  At year's end, the number of primary connections increased 
to 
206,502. Disregarding the 3,935 lines for receiving data 
packets, direct [channel] selection lines and service 
connections, which up to now have not figured in the number of 
primary service connections, the net increase in 1992 amounted 
to 10,807 units, that is, 5.64 percent. 
  Thus, the density of main lines reached 53 per 100 
inhabitants. During 1992, the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services Enterprise was confronted with 17,677 requests for new 
service connections to the telephone network (+3.7 percent). 
  Despite this new record in terms of the number of requests, 
the number of requests pending dropped from 4,924 (at the end of 
1991) to 4,101 (at the end of 1992), amounting to a 16.7-percent 
drop. This number at once includes requests that can be 
fulfilled and those in the process of being fulfilled as well as 
those requests that cannot be fulfilled for technical reasons. 
Disregarding requests that can be fulfilled with an average lag 
time of three weeks, the waiting list, which includes requests 
that occasion technical problems, contains 2,351 requests, all 
told. Thanks to exceptional efforts, it was possible to reduce 
this figure by 25 percent, relative to the corresponding figure 
last year (3,153). 
<H5>  2. New International Telephones Rates </H5>
  The Postal and Telecommunications Services authorities have 
made some significant reductions in rates, effective 1 March 
1992, to wit: 
  --a 30-percent reduction in rates for telephone calls to the 
United States and Canada 
  --a more economical telephone rate zone for Australia, Hong 
Kong, Japan and Singapore 
  --reduction in rates for all other non-European countries 
  --the automation of 92 additional linkups, including the 
Azores and Madeira 
<H5>  3. Telephone Repair Service </H5>
  In 1992, the "17" telephone repair service recorded a total 
of 176,482 calls, of which 34,428 required technical 
intervention. Of the outages reported, 78.6 percent were 
corrected, at the latest, within a day following report of the 
outage. 
<H5>  4. New Telephone Handsets </H5>
  In response to customer demand for cordless telephones that 
cannot be easily monitored and which guarantee every security 
against fraudulent use, the gamut of full-feature telephone 
handsets, available for sale to consumers, was rounded out by 
two cordless models meeting the stipulations of the CT1 European 
standard. 
<H5>  5. "Telekaart" Service </H5>
  To commemorate its sesquicentennial anniversary, the Postal 
and Telecommunications Services offices issued a series of three 
telephone calling cards, two of which evidence a commemorative 
design and are available for sale at PTT windows, and a third 
which is distributed on certain occasions. 
  The full complement of public telephones and card-operated 
telephones currently comprises some 100 units. Preparations, 
envisioning enhanced device compatibility, particularly in that 
they allow the posting of public operating instructions in a 
variety of languages, have been initiated. 
<H5>  6. International Leased Circuits </H5>
  The rapid expansion of leased digital circuits continued 
over 
the year 1992. 
  Beginning in 1992, the acquisition of signal mixing gear 
shall make it possible to offer the entire spectrum of signal 
transmission rates, in 64 kBit/sec increments from 64 kBits/sec 
to 2 MBits/sec. 
  We note that analog circuits are gradually being replaced by 
digital circuits, thereby occasioning a diminution of some 9 
percent during 1992. 
<H5>  7. 0800 Service </H5>
  0800 service, making it possible to bill calls to the party 
being called, has continued to enjoy the success of years past. 
Toward the end of 1992, 874 [0800] numbers were in service. Of 
these, 26 were nationally recognized toll-free numbers, 750 were 
0800 numbers usable in calls directed abroad, and 98 were for 
use when making calls from abroad. This amounts to an increase 
of 66 percent vis-a-vis the preceding year. 
<H5>  8. Serviphone </H5>
  This information service, permitting telephone service 
subscribers to gain access to information for a fee, by means of 
special caller numbers, is used for the dissemination of 
information, from computer software distribution via modem, to 
current cultural event information, to entertainment programs. 
<H5>  9. Direct Operator Access Service </H5>
  The "direct operator access service," making it possible to 
gain access to operators abroad by dialing a toll-free 0800 
number in Luxembourg is in operation to 17 different call 
destinations. 
  Service in the reverse direction, making it possible to call 
a Luxembourg operator from abroad, was initiated during 1992. By 
year's end, this service was available from 15 countries. 
<H5>  10. New Emergency Numbers </H5>
  Pursuant to the initiative of the European Community, the 
sole pan-European emergency assistance number, 112, was put into 
operation on 1 January 1993. This new number presently operates 
in tandem with 012, which latter number it could totally replace 
at some point in the future, once the new number has gained 
general acceptance. 
  Along with the emergency assistance number 112, another 
number, having as its destination the Force for Law and Order 
(police and gendarmerie) became operational. This is 113, which 
is reserved for emergency calls requiring these services. 
  Of course, both 112 and 113 are toll-free to the calling 
party. 
<H5>  11. Private Postal and Telecommunications Services Centers </H5>
  In 1993, a network having three private digital telephone 
exchanges (PBXs), for the telecommunications needs of various 
services of the General Directorate of Postal and 
Telecommunications Services, the Postal Division, and of the 
Telecommunications Division, was put into service. 
<H5>  12. Telephone Information Services </H5>
  In late 1992, the Postal and Telecommunications Services 
authorities put into operation a system of computerized access 
to telephone directories, thus permitting their "016" 
international information operators to gain access to foreign 
information databases, by means of terminal displays. 
  Questions and answers are routed via the public data packet 
switching network, in the form of formatted messages, in 
accordance with Technical Recommendation Tph 28, drafted by the 
former CEPT (European Conference on Posts and 
Telecommunications) and later adopted by the CCITT (Consultative 
Committee on International Telegraph and Telephone). 
  From the time the service came on-line, it was possible to 
implement a linkup with the following countries: 
  Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Great 
Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. 
  The average turnaround time for the nearly 120,000 
consultations made since the service was inaugurated is less 
than two seconds. 
<H5>  13. ISDN [Integrated Service Digital Network] </H5>
  Pursuant to the demand, on the part of some users and in 
view 
of the introduction of a public ISDN service in 1993, an 
intermediate approach was implemented in 1993. For the 
subscribers in the local sector of downtown Luxembourg, access 
to the international ISDN network was installed in collaboration 
with France Telecom. At year's end, 12 clients had access to 
this service. 
<H5>  B. Long-range Telecommunications and Data Services </H5>
<H5>  1. Luxpac </H5>
  In 1992, the extensions to the Luxpac network improved the 
quality of the service offered to the users. New features were 
introduced, for example, gates for assisting in error detection 
and correction routines. 
  A direct X75 link with Spain was established. The data rate 
for all international lines was set at 64 kBits/sec. For the 
primary links, the number of lines was increased and the X75 
multi-link protocol, which reduces considerably the effects of 
line perturbations, was installed. 
<H5>  2. Telex </H5>
  Along with the telephone rates, telex rates over links with 
non-European countries were reduced on 1 March 1992. However, 
the drop in subscribers and in the number of minutes charged was 
discernible in 1992. This is due, above all, to the introduction 
of new features and the rapid growth of facsimile services 
which, in the long term, shall lead to the total elimination of 
telex services. 
<H5>  3. Videotex </H5>
  The efforts of the Videotex 200 group, which latter body is 
made up of representatives of the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services bureaus, of the Videotex Association in Luxembourg, of 
the Ministry of Communications, and of the Ministry of State 
have managed to reach a consensus with regard to the technical 
structure and the overall philosophy of the videotex system of 
the future. The Postal and Telecommunications Services 
authorities have developed and presented a prototype of this new 
system. International videotex links have been expanded and 
adapted to the new international environment. 
<H5>  4. Electronic Message Forwarding and Directory Service (X400 </H5>
and X500) 
  Preliminary efforts, for permitting the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services authorities to participate in an 
X500 research project, within the context of the CCE's (EC 
Commission's) Value II program, in conjunction with the RESTENA 
(National Education Telecommunications Network) project team and 
other partners from the private and public sectors, were 
integrated in 1992. X500 represents a collection of standards 
defining the implementation of international electronic 
directories in conjunction with electronic message distribution 
system (X400 standards). 
<H5>  5. Public-access Network for Alarm Transmission </H5>
  The efforts of a working group made up of representatives of 
the Ministry of the Treasury, the Ministry of State, the Forces 
for Law and Order, and the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services authorities have managed to reach a consensus with 
regard to the status of a future public alarm network which 
would eventually replace the present Postal and 
Telecommunications Services network (RPTA). The Center for 
Telecommunications and Public Alarms, attached to the Ministry 
of State, has inaugurated a study to define the needs of future 
users of the new network. 
<H5>  6. Domestic Network for Alarm Transmission </H5>
  Over the last few years, large-scale efforts have been 
undertaken with the aim of improving the availability and 
security of telecommunications services. In this context, a 
system for transmitting alarms generated by different 
telecommunications equipment as well as by auxiliary 
installations or surveillance equipment was put into operation 
in July of 1992. All alarms are forwarded to a central dispatch 
area that is manned around the clock and from which the 
necessary intervention is inaugurated in the event of an 
incident. 
<H5>  7. European Multi-protocol Service (EMPS) </H5>
  The installation of EMPS on a European scale in 1992 is the 
follow-on to the Cosine IXI (Cooperation for Open System 
Interconnection Networking in Europe - International X25 
Infrastructure) pilot network managed by the Associated European 
Research Networks (RADE), under the aegis of the European 
Commission. 
  Management of the EMPS was entrusted to the PTT Telecom of 
the Netherlands, which latter body subcontracted the operation 
of the Luxembourg EMPS node to the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services bureaus. Some public and private research centers are 
connected to that node by means of digital links rated at 64 
kBits/sec. The node is tied into the EMP topology by means of 64 
kBit/sec links connected to the nodes in Geneva and Brussels, 
and by a 64 kBit/sec X75 link to the Luxpac network. 
<H5>  C. Radio Engineering Services </H5>
  In 1991, preparatory efforts were begun for putting into 
operation a new mobile digital telephone network called LUXGSM. 
The order to provide and install the network went forth at 
year's end. [The network] is slated to go into operation in 
mid-1993. 
  The radio electronics services, Semaphone and 
radiotelephone, 
are posting continual progress. 
<H5>  1. Radiotelephone </H5>
  System 1 public ground-based mobile radio telephone service, 
in operation since 17 February 1975, currently comprises 5 
channels divided between two base stations. At year's end, 174 
radiotelephone links were in operation. 
  System 2 public ground-based mobile radiotelephone service, 
open to the public on 12 November 1985, currently comprises 58 
channels distributed among 7 base stations. At year's end, 946 
radiotelephone links were in operation. 
<H5>  2. Semaphone </H5>
  The public radio calling service, called Semaphone, was 
opened to the public on 12 November 1981. This service, covering 
the Benelux countries, made it possible to service only those 
receivers programmed to eight codes. 
  This service was replaced by a new Semaphone service which 
has been in operation since 7 June 1989 and, likewise, provides 
coverage of the Benelux countries. 
  The Semaphone service permits the use of receivers keyed to 
four codes, receivers with digital displays, and receivers with 
alphanumeric displays. As of 31 December 1992, 5,786 receivers 
were in operation. Of those, 2,078 were installed by the 
government. 
<H5>  3. Luxpaging </H5>
  The Luxpaging service, introduced in tandem with the new 
Semaphone service, uses alphanumeric receivers with an 
80-character reception capacity, exclusively. At present, this 
service's zone of coverage encompasses the city of Luxembourg 
and its environs. 
  This service numbers 134 subscribers. 
<H5>  4. Shielding </H5>
  The service for shielding premises against radio 
interference 
was saddled with 135 complaints. 
  In 45 of the cases, it was a matter of interference from 
television transmissions. On 18 occasions, audio emanation from 
radio broadcasts were to blame. Low-frequency high-fidelity 
equipment accounted for 7 cases, video equipment for 15, private 
radio network emanations for 10 instances, and, in 6 cases, 
television broadcast networks were found to be at fault. 
  The perturbations were occasioned particularly by 22 MHz 
transmitters, unauthorized radio broadcasting stations, 
defective or improperly connected receiving antennas, heating 
system thermostats, unregulated or defective television sets, 
and appliances not equipped with anti-interference gear. 
  In 34 cases, the problems have yet to be definitively 
controlled. 
  During an in-depth examination of non-public radio stations, 
62 reports having to do with reception were filed. 
<H5>  D. Documentation and Design Service </H5>
  This service was faced with 2,042 requests for information 
regarding the layout of underground telephone cables. The number 
of hours dedicated to troubleshooting were 7,017. Some plans and 
diagrams for the implementation of 1,930 new extension projects 
were drafted. The number of topographical surveys carried out 
while new underground cables were being installed increased to 
2,704. 
<H5>  E. Electrical Workshop </H5>
  The electrical workshop has carried out numerous works and 
service calls during 1992. We cite the following: 
  --the reconditioning of 1,698 telephone handsets 
  --the reconditioning of 134 different terminals 
  --the installation of 9 pay telephone booths 
  --the installation of 6 temporary telephone booths 
  --the establishment of the press center for the Tour de 
France 
  --replacement of 47 telephone handsets in public telephone 
booths 
  --1,927 service calls for telephone booth outages 
  --the installation, maintenance and repair of electrical and 
telephone equipment in the building of the Telecommunications 
Division (125 service calls) 
  --the remodeling of a post office 
  --maintenance and repair of alarm network equipment (65 
service calls) 
  --installation and deployment of 53 line concentrators 
  --57 occasions of the repair and transfer of telefax gear 
  --repair of public telephone booths at post offices (141 
service calls) 
  --the manufacture of some 130 different printed circuits for 
meeting the needs of the various services 
  --repair of information microsystem materiel (42 service 
calls) 
  --development and manufacture of 9 electronic equipment 
complexes 
<H5>  Logistics </H5>
<H5>  I. Regulation </H5>
<H5>  1. Regulation of Post Offices </H5>
  No significant changes, from the standpoint of regulation, 
took place during 1992, since the acts stemming from the XX 
Congress of the Global Postal Union, in Washington, D.C., and a 
new general regulation covering the postal service went into 
effect last year. 
  From the European side, the scenario is marked by the 
publication of the Green Book of the EC Commission, regarding 
the development of a single postal services market. 
  The Enterprise shares in the global approach of the 
Commission which, by means of balanced liberalization and 
harmonization, intends to guarantee EC citizens and 
organizations a reliable, high-quality, global postal service. 
  The Enterprise is always available, time and time again, 
even 
before some interlocutors who vary dramatically on the topic of 
certain propositions in the cited book that could occasion 
serious economic consequences for the Enterprise. Moreover, a 
liberalization of intra-EC and international mail would bring 
with it a skimming of the mail exchanged and would reduce the 
volume of mail to be distributed, where the rates are the 
highest. 
  Last September, the European Conference of Postal and 
Telecommunications Services (CEPT) administrations, divided into 
two section--postal services and telecommunications--adapted its 
structure to the requirements of the EC. Thus, the organization 
does not encompass more than the administrative authorities of 
the member countries and has become a regulatory body. 
  For their part, the postal service operators, including the 
Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise, have come to 
make up an independent and specialized association. It is within 
this renewed framework that the postal service operators are 
called upon to cooperate with the [provisions of the] Green Book 
and in its perpetuation. 
<H5>  2. Telecommunications Regulation </H5>
  On 17 February 1992, two regulations, emanating from the 
echelon of the Grand Duke and concerning public telex and 
teletex services, went into effect. 
  These regulations take into account the Grand Duke's 
regulation of 3 August 1990, establishing the general provisions 
applicable to public telecommunications services, while 
respecting the structure adapted by the other interconnected 
public services. 
  In terms of the schedule of rates, the regulation governing 
telex service brought with it a noticeable drop in rates for 
international communications. 
  The Grand Duke's regulation of 17 February 1992, amending 
his 
regulation of 8 October 1990 concerning public telephone 
service, is accompanied by a significant reduction in rates for 
international communications and inaugurates the automation of 
telephone service over 92 supplementary links. 
<H5>  II. Personnel </H5>
<H5>  A. Employee Management </H5>
  For 1992, the Government released no new authorization for 
new hiring, so that the total manpower strength of the Postal 
and Telecommunications Services Enterprise remained constant. 
  Taking employment vacancies into account, during 1992, the 
processing of 90 new hires was initiated. During this same 
fiscal year, the Enterprise was obliged to register the 
following: 
  --33 resignations 
  --18 retirements 
  --1 death 
  --4 dismissals 
  --10 changes in administration 
  --36 occasions of leave-without-pay 
  --5 occasions of leave-at-half-pay 
  On the topic of accrued leave, the situation has not 
improved, so that the number of hours of leave reportable for 
fiscal year 1993 increased to 153,717 hours for the entire 
personnel staff. 
  The 1 September 1993 effective date of the 10 August 1992 
law 
setting up the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise 
had significant repercussions for the management of personnel. 
As of that date, all administrative proceedings involving 
personnel fall within the purview of the Enterprise's management 
committee. This change, which necessitated some significant 
preliminary efforts for adapting management of the personnel 
staff to its new circumstances, occasioned certain procedural 
simplifications, particularly with respect to the replacement 
and recruitment of personnel. 
  Finally, a new personnel services station, concerned with 
disbursements to postal workers was set up for ensuring, 
beginning with fiscal year 1993, the payment of salaries, 
allowances, wages, etc., operations heretofore ascribable to the 
competence of the Ministry of Public Affairs. 
<H5>  B. Professional Training </H5>
<H5>  1. The Training of Trainees </H5>
  The service has trained 35 new recruits, in the career 
fields 
of engineer-technician, technical copyist and craftsman, to take 
up their duties in the various services. 
  Thirteen participants took a course expressly designed for 
agent-trainees in different administrative career fields. 
<H5>  2. Retraining and Advanced Training Courses Held Within the </H5>
Cadres of the IFA 
  During the year, 11 courses introducing agents in different 
career fields to new services and different technologies were 
organized. 
<H5>  III. Materiel and Buildings </H5>
<H5>  A. Materiel </H5>
<H5>  1. Equipment </H5>
  The equipment complement was rounded out by the acquisition 
of calculating devices and electronic typewriters. 
  Some 100 metal mailboxes were replaced by others fashioned 
of fiberglass reinforced polyester. 
<H5>  2. Security </H5>
  In 1992, the post office security program was defined in 
terms of the installation and improvement of security zones, 
this latter by means of the installation of armored doors and 
windows. Twenty-seven safes were replaced. 
  The video surveillance installations were improved and the 
CFM building was integrated into the video surveillance system 
for the buildings at the Luxembourg Train Station. 
  At the Postal Center and at the CFM building, additional 
doors, serving as fire walls, have been installed. The fire 
alarm system has been extended to all the buildings at the 
Luxembourg Train Station. 
<H5>  3. Customer Service </H5>
  In order to permit the public to obtain stamps, outside of 
established business hours, some additional postage dispensers 
have been put into operation. 
  Out of concern for the continual improvement of customer 
service, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise 
has inaugurated the installation of 12 additional telephone 
booths, including 5 for handicapped users. 
  Apart from that, the post office at Roodt/Syre was equipped 
with an access ramp for the handicapped. 
<H5>  B. Buildings </H5>
  The activities of the Public Buildings Service, in close 
collaboration with the Public Buildings Administration, are 
outlined as follows: 
  --expansion efforts at the Roodt/Syre post office 
  --efforts toward the construction of a building for the 
Telecommunications Division at Gasperich 
  --efforts toward cleanup and refurbishment at the 
Telecommunications Center at the Luxembourg Train Station 
  --construction of an auxiliary cable depot at the 
Reckange/Mess Telecommunications Center 
  --installation of climate control equipment at the 
telecommunications centers at Kirchberg, Luxembourg Train 
Station, downtown Luxembourg and Steinfort 
  --the outfitting of key stations for mobile ground-based 
radiotelephone service, at Hivange, Howald, Kehmen, Mondorf, 
Neidhausen, Redange/Attert and Wiltz 
  --the initiation of efforts to outfit mobile ground-based 
radiotelephone stations at Beaufort, Binsfeld, Burange, 
Diekirch, Echternach, Hamiville, Harlange Poteau, Potaaschberg, 
Quatre-Vents, Riesenhof, and Vianden. 
<H5>  IV. Data Services </H5>
  Once again in 1992, efforts were actively pursued toward 
setting in motion and developing a data system in response to 
requests for new connections, cancellation of subscriber 
services or conversion of an installation to the telephone 
network. Computerized data capture from telephone directories 
has been modernized. However, we note that it was not possible 
to implement those applications as quickly as desired, due 
consideration being given to the fact that part of the computer 
services personnel in charge were obliged to concern themselves 
with the shift in the ongoing applications toward another 
version of the operating system. 
  The release of SAP accounting software, whose application 
was 
imposed subsequent to the change in status of the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services Enterprise, requiring that business 
accounting be set up, turned out to be a success. 
  We note that the study concerning the installation of a 
personal computer network in the post offices was actively 
pursued and the startup of the first offices [equipped with PCs] 
is expected in late 1993. Again, it is at that juncture that 
connection of the CCP service to the international Eurogiro 
network shall take place. 
  The installation of individual PCs is proceeding in 
accordance with a sensible fiscal envelope established by the 
management echelon. 
  Early in the year, an IBM System ES 9000 replaced the 
timeworn computer at the Postal and Telecommunications Services 
Computer Center. 
<H5>  V. Postal Services Garage </H5>
  At the end of 1992, the motor pool for the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services [Enterprise] was comprised of: 
  --cars/vans: 562 units 
  --trailers/rescue-emergency vehicles: 51 units 
  --antique vehicles: 3 units 
  Taking into account the 75 vehicles put into service in 
1992, 
at the end of 1992, the motor pool numbered 613 units. One 
hundred eighty seven units were equipped with a 3-way catalytic 
converter and 57 with a diesel engine. 
  For fiscal year 1992, 52 units were phased out. 
  Throughout the year 1992, the Enterprise's vehicles logged 
6,880,000 kilometers. 
<H5>  VI. Public Relations </H5>
  In the domain of public relations, 1992 was marked by the 
150th anniversary of the creation of the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services Administration in the Grand Duchy of 
Luxembourg and the change in its status, transforming it into a 
public Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise. 
  The activities planned for the commemoration of the 
anniversary provided the ideal setting for presenting the new 
Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise to the general 
public. 
  Also, on 27 August 1992, during a press conference, the 
program "150 Joer Post" [The Postal Service: A Sesquicentennial] 
was presented to the public. 
  From this program, whose final phase is slated for late June 
1993, we present to you in this report but the three principal 
thrusts that are being developed in 1992. 
  "Wir entdecken die Post" [[Ger., "[we are] discovering the 
postal service"]] is the title of a booklet specially designed 
for children, by instructors and specialists of the Postal and 
Telecommunications Services bureaus. This booklet was 
distributed free of charge to pupils of the third grade of 
primary school, by the postal authorities and mailmen in all the 
country's schools. 
  Among the various sporting events [concomitant to] "150 Joer 
Post," the cycling event, "10 Stonne Velo an der Stad" 
[probably, "All-city 10 Stonne (likely a unit of measure) 
Cycling Event"], organized by the friends of the Bureau of 
Posts, Telephone and Telegraph (PTT), enjoyed such success that 
the authorities within the organization decided to stage an 
encore event in 1993. This event has a good chance of becoming 
an established event in the country's calendar of sporting 
events. 
  The presence of the Postal and Telecommunications Services 
Enterprise, represented by a pavilion at the Luxembourg 
International Fair in the autumn of 1992, marked the turning 
point in the year's events. At this pavilion, the Enterprise, 
while showing off its significant past and its role in the 
development of the country, certainly manifested itself as a 
modern, efficient and operational undertaking. 
  In order to introduce you to the musical competition, "Die 
Letzebuerger Postmarsch," the academic session, the public 
holidays, the historical tome, "Eis Post," etc., we refer you to 
the 1993 management report of the Postal and Telecommunications 
Services Enterprise of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

<H5>  ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) </H5>
<H5>  EURIE 93: The European ISDN Event </H5>
  Is ISDN the digital network of the future? The preliminary 
conditions seem to be in evidence: the standardization of ISDN 
on the European plane, called EURO-ISDN, and European 
coordination for its introduction. It was with those 
considerations in mind that European service carriers signed the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in May of 1989, committing 
them to the implementation of a European ISDN service in 1993. 
  EURIE 93, to run from 14 through 16 December 1993, is the 
event that shows not merely that EURO-ISDN is now a reality on 
the public networks level, but, besides that, that a multitude 
of EURO-ISDN products and services is already available. Twenty 
European countries and 64 participants are involved in EURIE-93 
at more than 70 sites. In Luxembourg, the event is organized by 
the Postal and Telecommunications Services Enterprise of 
Luxembourg, in collaboration with ACOTEC-AEG of Luxembourg, 
Alcatel-Bell Business Systems, Comptoir Electrotechnique, 
COMTECH, CTTL Ericsson, IBM of Luxembourg, Olivetti, Philips of 
Luxembourg, SIEMENS, Telenorma, Telephonie, and Telindus. 
<H5>  Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) </H5>
  ISDN combines the idea of digitizing the network up to the 
consumer end and using the same network for all the 
telecommunications services. Thus, ISDN represents a global 
telecommunications network providing high-speed transmission and 
a standardized user interface. 
  ISDN represents an improvement over existing services 
(better 
quality and facilities for telephone [communications], better 
resolution and a higher transmission speed for telefax, etc.) 
and opens up an entire universe for new 
applications--videotelephony, LAN-to-LAN connections, on-demand 
pass band allocation, high-quality audio transmission, photofax, 
etc. 
  The public ISDN network with all its attendant services 
(bearer services, teleservices, and supplementary services) 
constitutes the basis for an entire series of applications that 
can be effected using terminal equipment. 
  Two types of connection are available for access to the 
public ISDN network: basic rate access (BRA) consisting of two 
channels at a rate of 64 kBits/sec and a 16 kBits/sec signaling 
channel (2B + D), and primary rate access (PRA) consisting of 30 
channels with a rate of 64 kBits/sec and a signaling channel 
also at a rate of 64 kBits/sec. Both connection modes use the 
standardized E-DSS 1 protocol. 
  The compatibility between the existing telephone network and 
the new ISDN network is guaranteed, so long as the persons 
communicating wish to use the same service, i.e., telephone 
service. 
<H5>  The Introduction of ISDN in Luxembourg </H5>
  The pre-commercial introduction of ISDN service, that is, 
the 
inauguration of the testing phase, is slated for March 1994. 
During this test phase, only national-level traffic will be 
possible. 
  The commercial-level introduction [of the service] is slated 
for May 1994. ISDN service shall be offered on a nationwide 
basis. Rates have not, as yet, been definitively set. 
<H5>  Direct Link Communications </H5>
<H5>  Leased Lines </H5>
  To have the necessary information at one's disposal when one 
needs it is an advantage of size in an era when one must be 
armed to make decisions rapidly. This is why modern enterprises 
depend upon a continuously available communications network, 
particularly a sure and reliable one. These are some needs to 
which the Postal and Telecommunications Administration is 
responding via a special service--leased lines. 
  This service permits you to lease fixed, point-to-point 
telecommunications lines for your telecommunications traffic. 
  'Round-the-clock Service... 
  Leased lines offer you numerous advantages: 
  --they are available to you 24 hours a day 
  --links are very quickly established 
  --large quantities of data can be easily transmitted 
<H5>  Directly Hooked Up to the World </H5>
  The possible applications of leased lines are numerous: 
  --telephone calls between your corporate headquarters and 
its 
branch offices --communication via telex, telecopier, and 
electronic mail 
  --data exchange (bulk data transfer/real-time computer 
connections) 
  --transmission of radio broadcasts and telecasts 
  --alarm transmission 
<H5>  Categories of Leased Lines </H5>
  --Analog leased lines offer two levels of quality: nominal 
quality (CCITT M 1040) and special quality (CCITT M 1020). 
  --Digital leased lines for telegraphy having rates of 50, 
100, and 200 bits/sec are planned. 
  --Compared to analog lines, leased digital lines offer the 
advantage of better transmission quality and very high speed. 
They make it possible to transmit data at rates of 64 kBits/sec 
or 2 MBits/sec, and eventually n x 64 kBits/sec, where n ranges 
from 1 to 30. 
  --Leased lines for the transmission of audio radio signals 
are offered with normal telephone tone quality at 3.4 kHz (CCITT 
M 1040), musical tone quality with a 7 kHz pass band (CCITT M 
1020), or with musical tone quality or stereophonic musical tone 
quality with a 15 kHz pass band (CCITT M 1020). 
  On the one hand, you may choose the leased line capacity 
that 
you require; on the other, you may select the type of 
information that you wish to transmit: 
  --voice communications 
  --telegraphic communications 
  --data transmission 
  --radio signal transmission 
  --alarm signal transmission, etc. 
<H5>  Subscription Requests and Rates </H5>
  The request for a subscription is tendered by means of a 
special form available at any post office. The form must be 
signed by one or both of the individuals or corporate entities 
linking up their remote facilities via the leased line requested. 
  For international leased lines, the subscription request 
must 
be signed by the individual or corporate entity whose terminal 
is on Luxembourg territory. The monthly leasing fee charged in 
Luxembourg is collectable from the Luxombourg user party. The 
Postal and Telecommunications Services Administration remains at 
your disposal for any additional information. Be so good as to 
call 4991-422 (analog lines) or [4991]-722 (digital lines) or 
4765-219 (international lines).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "European Union </F>
Ecofin Council To Debate Reduction of Taxes on Biofuels on 6 
June -- Creation of a Scientific Group in France"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Tours, 10 May 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As 
part of the first European Forum on Biofuels, the European 
Commissioner with responsibility for taxation, Mrs Christiane 
Scrivener, has announced that the Ecofin [Economic/Financial] 
Council will examine the plan for a reduction of taxes on 
biofuels at its meeting on 6 June. 
  Meanwhile, the French government has set up a scientific 
group that will attempt to promote the development of biofuels 
along with the concerned ministries (Industry, Environment, 
Higher Education and Research, Agriculture and Fisheries), 
announced Agriculture Minister Jean Puech, as he inaugurated the 
Forum. The new group, "Agriculture for Chemistry and Energy" 
(Agrice), to be chaired by Philippe Mangin, brings together 
representatives of the National Institute for Agronomic Research 
(INRA), national agricultural trade unions and industry. Mr 
Puech added that "the industries concerned by the future of our 
agriculture, as well as potential customers for the technologies 
being explored also wish to take part. Two major French 
enterprises, Total and Rhone-Poulenc, are currently representing 
these interests." France has chosen "an intelligent alternative 
to traditional set-aside, namely, industrial set-aside," he 
added.

  [Text] Bonn is making 600 million German marks [DM] 
available until 1997 for projects in microsystems technology. 
Strongly product-oriented plans are at the center of the funding 
program. 
  Although in past years the microsystems periphery has also 
profited from Bonn's money, up until 1997 allocated funds will 
be put exclusively into microsystems technology. The Federal 
Ministry for Research and Technology (BMFT) has added five 
measures to its project requirement specifications to which it 
wants to pay particular attention: a number of institutes are to 
be funded, such as the two nuclear research centers in Karlsuhe 
and Juelich as well as the Fraunhofer Society. Joint industrial 
projects in which at least two companies and one research 
facility are involved are also enjoying the financial infusion. 
Also being taken into consideration are basic research; the 
funding of scientific cooperation with other countries; and the 
deep involvement with qualifying measures, organizational 
development and the marketing of technology. 
  Funds in the amount of DM600 million are going in 
approximately equal parts to the funding of joint [projects] in 
which companies and institutes cooperate and into the pockets of 
large research facilities. The latter, however, may only use the 
money for research in microsystems technology. With the new 
[funding] concept, attention is no long being paid to 
indirect-specific funding in which individual companies were 
also sponsored. A not insubstantial portion of the money for the 
joint [projects] funding benefits projects which already 
received the go-ahead within the last three years and where the 
first products have been partly developed. 
  One example: a fiber-coupled interferometer based on 
integrated-optical waveguide structure, primarily useful in 
positioning in mechanical engineering with precision processing 
machines and manufacturing equipment for microelectronics. The 
firms of IOT -- Integrated Optics Technology -- and Euchner took 
part in this project. 
  New Sensor Technologies Predominate 
  It is notable that the majority of the projects in 
microsystems technology lead into new sensor technologies. Thus, 
the University of Magdeburg worked with three other firms in 
developing mass-sensitive sensors for environmental and process 
analysis. The Freiburg Fraunhofer Institute for Physical 
Metrology together with 13 medium-sized companies and one 
Russian cooperating partner worked out tin oxide gas sensors in 
thin-layer technology which is useful for the quantitative 
identification of CO[.sub]x[/], NO[.sub]x[/], 
CH[.sub]4[/], C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH, H[.sub]2[/] 
and NH[.sub]3[/] in complex gas mixtures. Magnet-resistive 
sensors for length and current measurement are the result of 
cooperation between the Wetzlarer Institute for Microstructure 
Technology and Optoelectronics (IMO) and seven medium-sized 
companies. The high degree of participation of research 
facilities and companies from East Germany is notable. In all, 
companies from the nine German states participated in at least 
70 percent of all projects and received 20 percent (DM48.4 
million) of the BMFT funds. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-EST-013L-02A>      The second BMFT Microsystems Technology Funding Project runs until 1997: Approximately DM260 </FIG>

  The link between the Bonn ministry and the companies 
interested in funds is the Teltower VDI[Association of German 
Engineers]/VDE[Association of German Electrical Engineers] 
Technology Center Information Technology. Responsibilities range 
from theme verification to application. Since the founding of 
the Center, 4,600 projects have already been taken care of by 
its 100 colleagues. Christoph Stoppok, Program Director for 
Microsystems Technology in the Teltower VDI/VDE Center, points 
out that matters which concern the initiators of the funding 
concept include "making the results of [funded work] accessible 
to everyone, since the projects were after all funded by public 
money." Thus, companies could also participate indirectly in the 
BMFT's financial beneficence. 
  Dr. Hans-Peter Lorenzen from the BMFT mentioned at the 
presentation of the new funding program that "meanwhile there 
are perhaps already too many institutes in this country working 
on microsystems technology." He is trusting to market mechanisms 
to take care of this excess. The new concept should above all 
concentrate on supporting pre-competitive joint projects 
following the model of the Japanese concept of promoting 
economic development. 
  Was Is Microsystems Technology Anyway? 
  With all its good plans and intentions, the BMFT certainly 
still has problems with the definitions of microsystems 
technology. For Lorenzen it is the integration of sensor 
functions, signal processing and actuator structures. To this 
extent it is not surprising that microsystems technology in 
Germany primarily means sensor technology. The VDE/VDI 
Technology Center Information Technology, like Prof. Anton 
Heuberger, Director of the Berlin (the future Izehoer) 
Fraunhofer Institute for Silicon Technology, expands the 
definition somewhat: accordingly, microsystems technology is the 
integration of microelectric and other functions (such as 
optical, electromagnetic, mechanical, chemical and biological) 
in a miniaturized solid-state system. 
  Criticism of Funding 
  Disparaging words regarding BMFT funding could be heard 
especially from Prof. Heuberger. He is critical that there are 
still delays at the intersection between technological 
developments and the translation [of such advances] into 
products. It is not least for this reason that he--in contrast 
to the naive prognosis of the BMFT, which still speaks of a 
leading roll for Germany--sees that the true potential for 
microsystems technology has already moved to Japan. 
  The number of Germany's missed opportunities, following 
microelectronics and precision engineering, could continue with 
microsystems technology. Not least [in significance is that] 
with microelectronics the Japanese industry dominates the most 
important prerequisite for microsystems technology. How could 
the industrial landscape here [in Germany] escape from this 
dilemma? Heuberger finds the philosophers' stone in so-called 
technology brokers. These could be facilities, institutes or 
companies which slip into the roll of being service providers 
while at the same time taking responsibility for the product to 
be produced. A good understanding of the landscape of 
international suppliers of technologies and services is required 
here. Similarly as with ASIC production, these technology 
brokers are concerned not only with the design but also with the 
production and assembly of the microsystems technology products. 
In contrast to the Fraunhofer and other research institutes, the 
brokers refer to all internationally available technology and do 
not limit themselves only to in-house developments. Heuberger 
forcefully urges the support of a German supplier of software 
tools, without which the microsystems technology industry in 
this country would be made dependent on foreign suppliers. 
  Convert Results Rapidly and With Determination 
  It is certainly hopeful when Research Minister Paul Krueger, 
viewing the annual distribution of funds after 1994, considers a 
drop indefensible and announces corresponding measures. What 
will be decisive in the future, however, will not be the funds 
from Bonn's cornucopia but rather the functioning cooperation 
between institutes and industry and the rapid conversion of 
results into marketable products.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Maintaining Position in Top Group on </F>
World Market"; "About the (Difficult) Position of German Machine 
Tool Industry"] 
  [Text] When victims of the already long lasting 
worldwide weak economy are listed, then the German machine tool 
industry will appear on top. What was already apparent at the 
9th EMO [World Machine Tool Fair] in Paris 1991 and became even 
more so at the 10th EMO in Hannover last September could now 
have reached its bottom and, under favorable conditions, could 
possibly recover. The first signs indicate a slight improvement, 
which will perhaps translate into the concrete form of orders 
placed at the 1994 Metav in Duesseldorf. In anticipation of this 
so much hoped for "Metal Processing Market," the Association of 
German Machine Tool Manufacturing Plants (VDW) drew up a balance 
sheet which, for lack of requisite official 1993 statistics, is 
based on official semiannual figures and on the Association's 
own projections. 
  The year 1993 was painful to the German machine tool 
manufacturers, a direct consequence of the already third 
downward trend seen in all the relevant indicators: 
  --Production decreased to an about 5 million DM lower level 
(-25%) by midyear and then to an about 10 billion DM lower 
level (-29%) level by the year's end, thus to the level 
which 
the old Federal States had last time reached in 1985. 
  --In foreign trade imports decreased, owing to a weaker 
domestic demand, by 42% (in the first half-year period of 
1993) 
and thus even more than did exports (-20%). The foreign 
trade 
figures for 1993 must be interpreted with caution, however, 
because conversion to European Community covering statistics 
results in an underestimation of especially the import volume. 
  In the import structure all the 15 main seller countries, 
except the People's Republic of China, post only minus figures. 
Imports from the three top ranking seller countries -- 
Switzerland, Italy, Japan -- still head the list, as they have 
before, and may even claim larger shares of the total imports 
(55% as of now). The larger than 50% decline of 
imports from 
competitors in the Far East reflects a downfall of Japanese 
sales on the German market. 
  In the export structure, although minus figures prevail here 
too, there can be detected some encouraging signs. During the 
first half-year period of 1993 the top position among the 
largest foreign markets for the German machine tool industry was 
taken over by Italy, following a huge order from the Italian 
automobile industry. Most of all metal cutting machine tools are 
being delivered to the People's Republic of China, which has in 
the meantime fallen into the third position behind the U.S. on 
the list of the largest foreign markets. Particularly high 
growth rates were last reported here for processing centers, 
transfer lines, lathes, and gear cutting machines. Taking this 
development into consideration, the Association of German 
Machine Tool Manufacturers (VDW) has in August 1993 opened a 
liaison office in Peking so as to ensure their constant presence 
in this important growth market. 
  The unusually large increase of exports to the Portuguese 
market, attributable to delivery of presses to the automobile 
industry, should be regarded as a once occurring phenomenon 
rather than a sign of a continuing market growth. It has to do 
with the Ford-Volkswagen joint "AutoEuropa" venture in Palmela 
near Setubal, rated as the largest investment made in Portugal 
in its entire history. 
  When the evaluation of market opportunities is based on 
orders received from foreign countries, then those which had 
come (by the end of September 1993) from the U.S., the People's 
Republic of China, CIS countries, France, Italy, and South Korea 
top the list. The total orders from abroad, though, had remained 
weak at a 25% lower level than during the corresponding 
period 
of the previous year. Then, however, first increases (+ 
9%) in 
foreign orders took place during the August-October 1993 period: 
  --The decline of orders to a 50% level since 1991 
unmistakenly characterizes the prevailing conditions in this 
industry. 
  --With a 4.6 months' long lead time for filling orders, a 
nearly constant level was reached during the last few months 
which, however, must be viewed against the background of quite 
visibly reduced capacity levels. The same applies to matching 
under-full capacity levels, which last (end of September 1993) 
was 73% and thus 10% lower than in the previous 
year. 
  --The employment level in German machine tool manufacture 
follows the same trend, despite efforts by enterprises to hold 
the line: the number of people employed in this industry 
nationwide having been necessarily cut from over 89,000 by 30 
December 1992 to about 75,000 by end of September 1993 and 
likely continuing to be cut. 
  Under these circumstances there is nothing to conceal or 
embellish. Two years ago, in anticipation of the 1992 Metav, an 
analysis had been made by the Enterprise Consultants in Munich 
(UBM) and its results then published in a brochure under the 
title "Small Cause -- Large Effect: Why Millions of Jobs 
Nationwide Depend on a Few Thousand Jobs in Machine Tool 
Manufacture" for distribution at the 1993 Hannover EMO and for 
thus educating the broad public. Publication of these facts has, 
indeed, raised the awareness above all among politicians and 
bankers as well as trade unions and employers. The extent of 
changes which within the past two years have taken place in the 
German machine tool industry was unprecedented since the end of 
the war. The machine tool manufacturers do everything they can 
to avoid further cutbacks. Unfortunately, the demand for 
short-term effective capital subsidies provided for in the 
enacted "Stability and Growth" Law is falling on deaf ears in 
Bonn. This so because slumps which are only "moderate" in terms 
of the national economy do not open the eyes of politicians to 
the fact that there is a connection between the decline of the 
German machine tool industry and a not only quality-wise but 
also already dangerous threat to Germany's production status. On 
the contrary: the strictest export control in Europe is now, as 
before, practiced in Germany and its bureaucratic procedures 
additionally burden the machine tool industry. These 
restrictions and changed currency exchange rates, have 
additionally impaired the position of German manufacturers on 
the international market and thus also their overall status in 
1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "ESA Agreement on Manned </F>
Flight Projects"; AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL 
introduction is "Europe prepares a manned module, a crew 
transport capsule, and a `space tow vehicle.'"] 
  [Text] The European Space Agency [ESA] Council that met on 
15 February in Paris adopted the "Council act" authorizing the 
effective launch of the Columbus manned orbital component and 
MSTP [Manned Space Transport Program]. This was as expected (see 
AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL No. 1457-58). 
  The "act," says the ESA, provides the legal and financial 
bases for starting up the MSTP and Columbus programs 
immediately. The programs will be funded for 203 and 267 million 
AU (Accounting Units) respectively for the 1994-95 period. 
  It also confirms the creation of a single management 
structure for the two programs, which will be combined into a 
comprehensive one for "manned flight space ventures" beginning 
in March of 1994. As planned, the program will entail the 
construction of a ballistic crew transport vehicle (CTV), an 
automated interorbital transfer tow vehicle (ATV), and a manned 
Columbus laboratory-module (APM). Europe's new Ariane 5 rocket 
will launch all three. The program also calls for European 
astronaut flights aboard the Russian orbital station Mir or U.S. 
space shuttles. 
  "With this decision, member states have confirmed their 
willingness to take part in the worldwide effort to collaborate 
on an international space station and to negotiate with all the 
partners involved (United States, Russia, Japan, and Canada)," 
the ESA notes. The agency stresses that "these decisions free 
up--for the next two years--the resources needed to lay the 
foundations of European space programs in the year 2000!" 
  Furthermore, the ESA Council confirmed that the observation 
satellite programs Envisat and polar Platform will also be 
managed within a single organization, and that the DRS [data 
relay satellite] design phase and new studies of future orbital 
transport systems (FESTIP) had begun. 
  ESA general director Jean-Marie Luton feels the decisions 
"take into account the economic realities and political changes 
in Europe and the world" and "indicate the Agency's willingness 
to forcefully and coherently pursue its ambitions in the areas 
of environmental studies, science and its applications, 
telecommunications, and manned flight launch capabilities." 
  In addition, the Council has suggested that the ecu be used 
as the sole standard currency for ESA payments beginning in 1997.

"Return from Space"] 
  [Text] ESA's [European Space Agency] technology spin-off 
program, set up over eighteen months ago to transfer the most 
innovative research from Europe's space programme to more 
terrestrial uses, is beginning to bear fruit with medicine the 
prime beneficiary. However, an agreement between French and 
German companies to use composite molding techniques, developed 
for spacecraft antenna, in the production of civil aircraft 
simulators, represents the first transfer of the programme. 
  In another early success Photek Ltd., a UK company, has 
taken 
a licence on an ESA patent covering developments in imaging 
techniques used by ESA in optical astronomy. Photek specialises 
development of high intensification photoncounting cameras for 
biomedical applications. The cameras can capture high quality 
pictures of the sub-molecular structure of cells, and are used 
as tools in DNA research and as an aid to new techniques such as 
fluorescent microscopy, which offers advances in the way the 
spread of certain diseases may be monitored. 
  Photek initially plans to carry out further development of 
the camera through an EC Eureka programme called "Phobia" in 
collaboration with the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory and 
Scottish and Dutch partners. The camera will then be marketed 
worldwide by Photek; at that stage, ESA will collect royalty 
revenue to feed back into the transfer program. The licence 
agreement was made possible by the efforts of Spacelink Europe, 
the consortium of technology transfer agents set up by ESA to 
assist with the spin-off program. Spacelink publishes an annual 
catalogue of space technology and is able to assist non-space 
companies at all stages of the transfer process, including the 
all-important sourcing of investment funds for technology 
adaptation. The catalogue is called TEST (Transferable European 
Space Technologies) and is distributed annually in five 
languages to more than 30,000 companies throughout Europe. TEST 
3 has recently been issued and contains "offers" of innovative 
space technology in many fields, including optics, sensors, 
communications and robotics which are available for licence for 
use in other applications. Another early success for the 
programme has been the adaptation of novel material techniques, 
developed by Brunel Institute for Bioengineering for an ESA 
orbiting laboratory programme, to orthopaedic surgical 
applications. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) can be made into 
structures whose shapes can be controlled precisely by heating 
them to a known temperature. With assistance from the ESA 
programme, Brunel has developed a range of SMA staples which, 
when cooled and used to join a fractured arm or leg bone, alter 
shape as they heat to body temperature to hold the ends of the 
fracture in compression and speed the healing process. Hospital 
trials of the staples are imminent and, when these are complete. 
Brunel will collaborate with medical equipment suppliers to 
market them worldwide. 
<H5>  Many Contacts </H5>
  Over 90 company-to-company negotiations stimulated by the 
ESA 
programme are in progress and eight transfers have already been 
signed or are close to completion. One particularly satisfying 
aspect is the transnational nature of most of the contacts. For 
example, spotting the wider possibilities for some high spec 
seals developed in France for use in rocket motors, the 
Spacelink UK agent will be able to alert a UK supplier to their 
existence. The company was seeking higher performance seals to 
meet tighter EC environmental regulations and, with assistance 
from the Spacelink partner in France, a licence deal is now in 
its final stages. 
  Many other examples of transnational co-operations are 
taking 
place. Prototype miniature pumps developed for a space based 
microgravity laboratory are currently being evaluated for 
several applications including the continuous infusion of 
intravenous drugs by an Italian medical equipment company. The 
device -- four of which would fit in a matchbox -- has the 
ability to pump minute quantities of fluid continuously with 
great accuracy and reliability. Elsewhere, a Danish producer of 
advanced power supplies is in negotiation with a potential 
German collaborator, and Swiss-originated solid-state 
accelerometer technology is attracting interest throughout 
Europe. 
  Transfers in progress are not confined to hardware. There is 
also much interest in ESA's software. A "generalised" version 
of the "ESA Software Engineering Standards," which have been in 
demand by software engineers since their introduction to space 
programs by ESA a number of years ago, have now been accepted 
for worldwide promotion by an international publishing house. 
Again ESA will benefit from royalty returns on the sales and it 
is the agency's plan that royalty income from such transfers 
will eventually make the program self-supporting. 
  The momentum of the technology transfer program is now 
increasing as links continue to be forged between space and 
non-space companies. A database of over 2,000 companies 
actively seeking new technology has been established and 
Spacelink undertakes regular focused searches of the ESA 
research establishment ESTEC in the Netherlands for technology 
to meet specific terrestrial needs. One hundred and ten space 
technologies are on offer for transfer through the first two 
issues of the TEST catalogue, and significant opportunities 
exist for companies seeking to broaden their technological base 
to take advantage of the money invested throughout Europe in 
space research. 
  Many of the spin-off applications so far have been medical. 
Both space and medical engineers have interests in automation, 
advanced optics, sensors, materials technologies and 
miniaturisation, and both (at least currently) are better placed 
than other sectors to absorb the higher costs related to 
advances in these areas. 
  ESA is interested in hearing from non-space companies which 
are seeking innovative technology and space companies which 
believe they may have technology to offer.

<F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "ESA Proposes Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] France and Germany will have to make up most of the 
budgetary shortfall resulting from currency devaluations in 
Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Ministers of the member 
states are supposed to announce their decisions between now and 
mid-February. 
  The European Space Agency [ESA] failed to reach agreement, 
at 
the 31 January meeting of the agency council, on retroactive 
adjustments to all mandatory and optional member-state 
contributions to the Agency's programs. This annual adjustment 
exercise is needed in order to compensate, after the fact, for 
the inevitable fluctuation of exchange rates between the time 
that contribution levels were established and the date when 
member-state payments were actually converted (into ECU, or 
European Counting Units). It is precisely the conversion to 
European money that poses problems for several member states, 
owing to the major devaluation of their currencies last year 
against the ECU, ESA's sole currency of reference. 
  At the earlier council meeting of 18 January, the Agency had 
set the end of the month as a deadline for resolving the 
question, in order to be able to effectively continue its 
general operations and launch the new manned flight programs 
(Columbus and MSTP [Manned Space Transport Program], which were 
approved after differences between Paris and Bonn were ironed 
out (Cf. A&amp;C No. 1456). But on 31 January, the "compromise 
package developed by the Agency's governing council to attenuate 
the effects of currency exchange variations and the introduction 
of the ECU" turned out to have "gone beyond the mandate of 
certain delegations," says Roger Elaerts, ESA spokesman. 
  Council president Pieter-Gael Winters of the Netherlands 
therefore decided to "submit the compromise proposal directly to 
the ministers of all member states for their approval," asking 
them to "respond before mid-February." And so the 13 member 
states (plus Finland and Canada, as associated states) were 
given further time in which to agree to this compromise, which 
requires additional contributions by the "rich countries" to 
compensate for the financial constraints weighing on the "poor 
countries." 
  More precisely, France and Germany (which benefited from a 
favorable revaluation of their currencies against the devalued 
ones) must increase their financial participation in order to 
lighten the burden on the disadvantaged countries--that is, the 
countries disadvantaged by the devaluation--namely Spain, Italy, 
and the United Kingdom. 
  So much for the short term, i.e., adjustment of this year's 
contributions by means of the Agency's compromise, which if 
accepted will imply de facto adoption of all the juridical 
language authorizing the start-up of the new Columbus and MSTP 
programs. These programs, according to R. Elaerts, have already 
been almost fully subscribed since the previous ESA council 
meeting. 
  At the same time, the Agency's compromise proposes a new 
financial mechanism for resolving the long-term problem of 
fluctuations in ECU exchange rates. The basic idea is to scrap 
the current system (of payment in national currencies 
subsequently converted into ECU at the Agency) in favor of 
direct payments to the Agency in ECU, thus shifting to ESA 
member states the onerous task of converting their national 
currencies into European money. 
  It would obviously be desirable--now that Germany has agreed 
not to insist on equal parity with France in these programs--to 
have a quick resolution of the adjustment issue, which for 
several months now has impeded Agency operations, especially 
start-up of the manned flight programs. France for its part now 
plans to pay for one-fourth of the combined cost of the two 
programs--100 million UC [Counting Units] towards MSTP and 24 
million UC towards Columbus, whose 1994-1995 budgets are 207 and 
270 million UC respectively. 
<H5>  Ariane Probe </H5>
  On 26 January Arianespace, in conjunction with ESA and CNES 
[National Center for Space Studies], established a commission of 
inquiry to "establish the causes of the failure of flight 63." 
The commission is chaired by Jean-Paul Herteman, deputy 
technical director of SNECMA [National Company for the Design 
and Building of Aircraft Engines] (France). Vice chairman of the 
commission will be Eric Slachmuylders of ESA. The other 
commission members are Karl-Helmut Dederra of DASA [German 
Aerospace] (Germany), Mauro Varetti of Fiat (Italy), Jean-Paul 
Bozet of the University of Liege (Belgium), and Michel Pons of 
CNES. The secretariat will consist of Messrs. Thevenot and 
Lemoigne of SEP [European Propulsion Company] (France). The team 
is supposed to "present its initial conclusions in mid-February" 
and "recommend measures to be taken to correct the flaws 
identified" as responsible for the premature shutdown of SEP's 
HM7B engine. Flight 63 was the fourth of six unsuccessful 
Arianes in which the cryogenic propulsion system has been 
implicated (Cf. A&amp;C No. 1457).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels TECH EUROPE: "MEPs </F>
Champion European Space Industry Policy"] 
  [Text] What the space industry needs is a European Union 
policy to back it up, feels the European Parliament's Committee 
on Research. So with this in mind, the Committee members 
decided on April 26 to adopt a report by Christian Rovsing (EPP, 
DK), calling on the European Commission to prepare wide-ranging 
proposals on how to promote the competitiveness of Europe's 
space industry. 
  The Committee first of all wants the Commission to improve 
its cooperation with the European Space Agency and other 
relevant European bodies. But more than this, the Committee 
members are making a plea for the Union to develop a 
full-blooded policy on space matters and so the Commission is 
urged to table proposals aimed at promoting European space 
technology applications and markets. MEPs are all in favor of 
defining a satellite navigation strategy to make sure the 
European industry makes its mark in the satellite technology 
sector. 
  On the research front, Euro-MPs believe in giving 
encouragement to European laboratories to get involved in 
developing space experiments, promoting training in space 
technology at EU level and making arrangements for the 
telecommunications dimension of the space policy to be mirrored 
in the EU's telecommunications policy. 
  As for external policy, MEPs want multilateral rules to be 
adopted so as to ensure that all is fair and above board when it 
comes to providing space launch and transport services. This 
report should be examined by the European Parliament on May 6.

Leading-Edge Role"] 
  [Text] Commission President Jacques Delors' White Paper on 
Growth, Competitiveness, Employment -- The Challenges and Ways 
Forward Into The 21st Century (Com (93) 700 of 5-12-1993), 
regards the application of technology and the right sort of 
research and development strategies as vital to growth and 
employment creation. 
<H5>  High Level Task Groups </H5>
  Reflecting this belief was the creation of a number of 
high-level task forces. The one most closely related to 
technology is headed by Commissioner Martin Bangemann 
(Industrial Affairs, Information Technologies and 
Telecommunications). It met for the first time in Brussels on 
15 February, bringing together a group of experts ("wise men"), 
mainly leading industrialists. 
  Their task is to pave the way for the "information highways" 
which form part of the Trans-European Networks, a system of 
infrastructure which the Commission has planned in order to 
complement the Single European Market. 
  The Bangemann group agreed on a work programme and the views 
of the professionals were garnered on the proposals for 
establishing a trans-European telecommunications network, one of 
the White Paper's priorities. Two sub-groups were established. 
Their chairmen are Carlo de Benedetti, president, Olivetti, and 
Etienne Davignon, Societe Generale. 
  The Christophersen Task Force, chaired by Henning 
Christophersen, (Economic and Financial Affairs -- in agreement 
with Mr. Delors -- Credit and Investments, Statistical Office) 
met for the second time on 21 February in Brussels. Its job is 
to oversee the implementation of the more conventional 
infrastructure programmes like transport and energy, ensuring 
efficiency, consistency and speed. 
  These task forces will pave the way for key aspects of the 
Trans-European networks highlighted by the White Paper, which is 
the response of Commission President Mr. Jacques Delors, to the 
European Union's unemployment crisis. It envisages the creation 
of 15 million jobs between now and the end of decade, by "making 
employment policy the centrepiece of our overall strategy." 
<H5>  Strong Role for R&amp;D </H5>
  Research and development and the extensive implementation of 
technology strongly linked to economic and industrial policies 
represents one of the White Paper's central themes. The 
Trans-European Networks providing a coherent infrastructural 
system is a clear manifestation of this. 
  The White Paper accepts that in some circumstances 
technological progress can erode jobs. However, it also sees it 
as a major stimulant of growth and hence job opportunities. The 
White Paper looks towards creating a "sustainable development 
model" by creating a healthy, open and decentralised economy. 
It therefore points to the following requirements: 
  -- making the most of the Single Market; 
  -- supporting the development and adaptation of small and 
medium-sized enterprises; 
  -- pursuing the social dialogue that has, to date, made for 
fruitful cooperation and joint decision-making by the two sides 
of industry, thereby assisting the work of the Community; 
  -- creating the major European infrastructure networks; 
  -- preparing and laying the foundations for the information 
society. 
  To ensure that the information society becomes a reality, 
the 
White Paper has drawn up an Action Plan consisting of the 
following: 
  -- promote the use of information technologies; 
  -- provide basic trans-European services; 
  -- create an appropriate regulatory framework; 
  -- develop training on new technologies; 
  -- improve industrial and technological performance. 
  The Bangemann Task Force is expected to report to the 
Council 
before the end of March, so that the Action Plan can be applied 
as soon as possible. 
  The information networks will integrate concepts like 
highways, access channels, service areas and highway users. 
Telecommunications hardware consisting of broadband optical 
fibre networks will represent the physical basis of this system. 
The anticipated priority applications of this are: 
teleworking; teletraining; telemedicine; and, links between 
administrations. 
<H5>  Information Highways on the Way </H5>
  Over the next ten years, it is expected that something like 
ECU150 billion will be needed to create these sort of high-tech 
structures. ECU67 billion will be required between 1994 and 
1999 for priority projects. The source of this investment will 
mainly be the private sector, with European money playing a 
kick-starting role. R&amp;D is also accorded some importance for 
job creation in coming years. Research at the national and 
Community level will be stepped up, embracing greater 
cooperation between companies. The Commission will propose that 
Member States implement this innovative vertical cooperation on 
the basis of a restricted number of large joint projects in the 
following areas: 
  -- new information technologies; 
  -- biotechnology; 
  -- ecotechnologies. 
  A forum for concertation and exchanges between the various 
European research bodies and centres is suggested. A science 
and technology assembly to encourage the development of 
concerted strategies linked to the Community's activities is 
another measure being advocated. 
  Other aspects of the Trans-European Networks, such as 
transport and energy, are dealt with by the White Paper. In 
essence it is a statement of economic policy which assesses the 
need to develop Europe-wide infrastructure, embracing the most 
advanced information and communication technologies. It also 
formally reaffirms the importance of mobilising and coordinating 
R&amp;D efforts towards clearly-defined economic goals.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Details on </F>
Research and Environmental Aid Schemes Authorized in Netherlands 
and Germany"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 18 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As EUROPE 
announced on 14 April (page 13), the European Commission has 
authorized environmental and research aid schemes in the 
Netherlands and Germany. Details follow. 
<H5>  A. Netherlands </H5>
  (i) Measures to lower the cost of R&amp;D personnel. 
Authorities 
intend to waive payment of a percentage of the income taxes and 
other taxes employers normally have to pay to the state in the 
case of research personnel or research institutes working on an 
R&amp;D project for a company on the basis of a contract. For 
basic 
industrial research or applied research and development, 
beneficiaries can deduct 25 percent of wage costs for salaries 
below ECU50,000 and 12.5 percent of wage costs for salaries of 
more than ECU50,000 (these percentages can vary). The maximum 
amount a company can retain is ECU4.6 million annually. Dutch 
authorities estimate that tax revenues will diminish by ECU161 
million. This measure leads to a maximum intensity of 16 percent 
calculated on the basis of the total R&amp;D project costs. 
Cumulation with other aid measures is only possible up to the 
allowable aid intensities. 
  (ii) Amendment of schemes subsidizing the use of energy 
conservation and wind energy technologies. The amendment 
regarding these subsidies granted for the purchase and 
investment in energy saving equipment considerably lowers the 
aid intensity and maximum amount of grant per firm (which were 
quite high). 
<H5>  B. Germany </H5>
  (i) Aid program in the microelectronics research and 
development field. With a budget of ECU31 million for 1994 to 
2000, this scheme provides direct subsidies for basic industrial 
research by enterprises and scientific institutions. The maximum 
aid intensity is 50 percent with enhancements for projects 
carried out by SMEs [small and medium-sized companies] (+10 
percent), in the ex-GDR (+10 percent) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR 
(+15 percent). Recipients are obliged to publish their results 
in specialized magazines. 
  (ii) Amendment of schemes already authorized by the 
Commission concerning the environment, energy conservation and 
the use of renewable energy in Germany. The limit on 
low-interest loans for enterprises located in eastern Germany 
will be raised from 500,000 to ECU1 million. The intensity of 10 
percent remains unchanged; the aid ceiling in eastern Germany 
thus rises to ECU100,000.

<F P=106> [EC press release No. IP/94/308: "Establishment in Seville </F>
of the Joint Research Centre's Institute for Prospective 
Technological Studies"] 
  [Text] This Friday, 15 April 1994, Professor Antonio 
Ruberti, the Commission member responsible for research and 
education, and Professor Elias Fereres, Spain's secretary of 
state for universities and research, signed an agreement in 
Seville setting up the Institute for Prospective Technological 
Studies [IPTS] of the European Union's Joint Research Centre 
[JRC] in the Cartuja Technology Park. 
  In the words of Professor Ruberti, the JRC's Institute for 
Prospective Technological Studies is a key component of the 
mechanism being set up by the Commission for the study and 
monitoring of developments in science and technology and for the 
assessment of research policy options. The institute, whose 
mission is to provide the Community and other European 
authorities with objective data and analyses on the broad trends 
in science and technology in Europe and the world, will work in 
close liaison with the organizations specializing in prospective 
studies and technology surveillance within the ETAN network set 
up in the framework of the future Programme of Targeted 
Socio-Economic Research under the European Union's fourth 
Framework Programme of RTD [research and technological 
development] (1994-98). 
  At the same time as the establishment agreement was signed, 
the IPTS and Seville University signed a collaboration 
agreement. In addition, a European economic interest grouping 
(EEIG) composed of the IPTS and undertakings from several 
European countries will be created. The Cartuja site's role as 
a regional centre for research, technology and innovation will 
be further enhanced by the installation in the near future of 
Spain's Scientific Research Council next to the IPTS. 
  The IPTS is one of the eight institutes of the Joint 
Research 
Centre. These institutes, each of which is specialized in a 
particular field (environment, remote sensing, advanced 
materials, etc.), conduct part of their activities under the 
specific programmes of the Framework Programme of RTD. They 
also provide scientific and technical support for the 
implementation of the Community's major policies in the field of 
the environment, energy, agriculture, etc. 
  In the coming years, the IPTS will set up a "European 
Science 
and Technology Observatory." This observatory, working in 
liaison with the equivalent bodies at national and European 
level, will be charged with collecting, processing and 
disseminating information on research and technological 
development policies in the industrialized countries, and their 
evolution. In addition, a technology monitoring system will be 
developed to detect new scientific breakthroughs and 
technological innovations at an early stage, and to draw them to 
the attention of community policymakers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Grants Go-Ahead to Aid Schemes"] </F>
  [Text] The European Commission has given the go-ahead to a 
number of state aid schemes throughout the Community. They have 
authorised local authorities in Denmark to offer grants of up to 
20 percent for the setting-up and expansion of Research Parks. 
  The purpose of Research Parks is to promote a closer 
cooperation between firms and universities. The grants will 
slightly ease the burden of paying for the park's facilities and 
will partly finance the consultancy services offered to resident 
firms. 
  Such benefits will be below the aid intensity of 50 percent 
allowed under the SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] 
guidelines for soft aid. The research Park is, in principle, 
open to all firms, but in practise it is almost entirely small 
companies (5-50 employees) which have been established in the 
existing Parks (150-200 firms). The maximum grant local 
authorities will be allowed to offer a Research Park will be 
around ECU1.3 million. 
  On 16 February, the Commission gave the green light to a 
Spanish R&amp;D State aid scheme for the aeronautical sector, 
which 
provides advances which are repaid in the event of a profitable 
return. 
  It is pointed out that, in order to upgrade Spanish 
aerospace 
technology and meet the challenges of the next decade, specific 
efforts need to be focused on important strategic objectives. 
Depending on the availability of funds, the total maximum budget 
appropriations for the implementation of the Plan will be 
approximately ECU105 million from 1993 to 1998. 
  The firms likely to participate in the Plan are 
geographically dispersed and often in Less Favoured Areas 
(LFAs), as defined by the Commission. The firms benefitting 
will repay the State contributions in the light of the 
application of the results of the applied research/development 
to products which they market, either individually or within 
national or international cooperation programmes. 
  Where basic industrial research is all that is carried out, 
the relationship with marketable products will come from the 
application of the knowledge acquired as aerospace equipment is 
developed and then marketed. Interest will be charged at 9 
percent or at the cost of borrowing on the international market. 
If the recipient does not implement the project in respect of 
which aid is granted, the advance is repayable in full with 
interest. 
  The Spanish authorities have confirmed that the final aid 
intensity for applied research/development will conform to the 
Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D (OJ C83/2 of 
11-4-86) 
and previous Commission decisions. The Commission therefore 
raised no objections to the scheme under the application of 
Articles 92(3)(C) of the EC Treaty and 61(3)(c) of the EEA 
[European Economic Area] Treaty. 
  Regarding the implementation of the German R&amp;D State aid 
scheme, "Basistechnologien der Informationstechnik" [Basic 
Technologies in Information Technology], the Commission has also 
raised no objections. The aim of this programme is to 
strengthen basic research in the field of micro- and 
optoelectronics on materials other than silicon. The scheme 
aims to support fundamental and basic industrial research 
relating to the Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D. 
The 
notified scheme is intended to follow a programme already 
approved by the Commission which lasted until the end of 1993. 
Those benefitting from the programmes include research 
institutes, enterprises and universities. The budget amounts to 
ECU194 million from 1994 to 1998. 
  According to the Community framework for State aids for 
R&amp;D, 
aid to scientific institutions, is not considered to be State 
aid as far as the EC-Treaty and the EEA-Treaty are concerned, 
unless the R&amp;D activities are undertaken on a contractual 
basis 
or in collaboration with the private sector. In so far as 
universities and research institutes are conducting fundamental 
research, its financing is not regarded as State aid. 
  The financing of collaborative projects between such 
institutes and the private sector, however, is considered as 
State aid. It follows from the criteria laid down in the 
Community framework for State aids for R&amp;D that the aid 
intensity in relation to the distance to the market place has to 
be considered as the most important element when assessing the 
impact of the aid scheme on trade and competition. 
  The notified intensity of 50-percent gross for basic 
industrial research projects, 60-percent gross for this type of 
research in the New Lander, 60 percent for SMEs and 65 percent 
for SMEs conducting such research in the New Lander is in 
accordance with the Community framework for State aids for 
R&amp;D 
and previous decisions by the Commission.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/P/94/22: "Commission To Create a </F>
European Science and Technology Assembly"] 
  [Text] On Commissioner Antonio Ruberti's initiative, the 
Commission has decided to create a "European Science and 
Technology Assembly." Following the example of the U.S. 
"National Research Council" or the Japanese "Japan Research 
Council," this consultative and advisory body is to assist the 
Commission in designing and implementing the Community's 
research and development policy in the field of technology. 
  Professor Ruberti underlined that "the Community can only be 
successful in the science and technology sector if it fully 
takes the versatility of European research into account for 
designing and assessing its actions. This new tool will make it 
possible." 
  The "European Science and Technology Assembly" will include 
approximately 100 high-level officials appointed on the basis of 
proposals from the various organizations involved in science and 
technology on the European level. 
  The creation of the Assembly had been announced by the 
Commission in the "White Book on Growth, Competitiveness, and 
Employment." Indeed, by establishing a direct, close, and 
permanent contact between the Commission on the one hand and the 
European scientific community and industrial world on the other 
hand, the Assembly will ensure that the Community's research and 
development activities have the expected positive impact on the 
European economy and society. 
  Technological research and development call for a growing 
part of the Community's financial resources. The activities 
carried out in the sector have considerable effects on the 
economic activity and the life of citizens. With the very high 
level of expertise of its members, the Assembly will be able to 
guarantee: 

  -  the relevance of the choices made in the field 
of science and technology; 
  -  the quality of research; 
  -  that the 
most recent developments in the field of technology as well as 
the needs of the economy and the society are taken into 
account. 

  The Commission will systematically request the 
opinion of the Assembly on a certain number of issues: the 
scientific and technological contents of the Community's 
research programs, the criteria and the methods for assessing 
proposals, etc. On its own initiative, the assembly can also 
prepare reports and give opinions on the various aspects of the 
Community's research policy or the development of science and 
technology in Europe and elsewhere.

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/367: "Commission Approves the </F>
German Aid Programme `Informatik 1994-99'"] 
  [Text] Today the Commission raised no objections to the 
implementation of the German R&amp;D state aid programme entitled 
"Informatik 1994-1999." 
  The scheme, with a budget of DM499 million (around ECU257 
million) up to 1999, finances fundamental research, basic 
industrial research and applied research and development. The 
aid is given in the form of outright grants. 
  Information technology is the science of recording, 
processing, storing and transferring information using technical 
resources. The aid measures under the information technology 
programme 1994-99 focus on certain main areas: 
  -- software technology/reliable information systems 
  -- parallel high-performance computing 
  -- bioinformation technology 
  -- neuroinformation technology 
  -- knowledge processing (artificial intelligence) 
  -- telecooperation 
  Beneficiaries are enterprises and research institutes. 
  Projects supported may receive 100-percent gross when they 
are considered to be fundamental research. The maximum aid 
intensity amounts to 50 percent for projects of basic industrial 
research and 25 percent for projects of applied research and 
development. Enhancements are foreseen when projects are carried 
out by SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] (plus 10 
percentage points), in the former GDR (plus 10 percentage 
points) or by SMEs in the ex-GDR (plsu 15 percentage points). 
  The Commission examined the notified programme in the 
context 
of the relevant treaty articles and the Community framework for 
state aids for R&amp;D. 
  The programme respects the criteria laid down in the 
above-mentioned framework and, consequently, the Commission 
raised no objections under the application of article 92(3)(c) 
of the EC-Treaty and article 61(3)(c) of the EEA-Treaty.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Sextant to Take Over Mors's </F>
Aviation Instrument Business"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Instruments generate 55 million French francs 
[Fr] in sales and employ fewer than 100 people in Blanc-Mesnil. 
They will be incorporated into Sextant's Vendome plant for 
on-board instruments. 
  The Mors group is heading for a second fiscal year in the 
red, with annual sales that plummeted from Fr650 million in 1992 
to Fr522 million last year. Its new president, Claude Manceau, 
presented a recovery plan for the company last 18 February. The 
scheme calls for Mors to sell its aviation instrument business 
to Sextant, and part with its 50-percent capital interest in 
CEIS TM, its joint venture with Technicatome. The Cogifer group 
will purchase Mors's share of CEIS TM, which earns annual sales 
of about Fr130 million from the production of medium-power 
turbines for nuclear submarines and Argos and Cospas-Sarsat 
beacons. 
  Though the sale of the joint venture to Cogifer has already 
been ratified, the Sextant Avionique deal must still be 
submitted for approval to the two groups' central 
worker-management committees sometime in the next two weeks. The 
selloff essentially involves on-board electromechanical 
equipment for airplane and helicopter engines, which currently 
generate Fr55 million a year in sales and employ a tiny staff of 
100 in the Paris suburb of Blanc-Mesnil. Sextant expects to 
incorporate production of the equipment into its on-board 
instruments plant in Vendome. The acquisition will add 
approximately 300 new product numbers to the already vast 
catalog of Sextant's on-board equipment. 
  For now, the exact details of the transaction with regard to 
the manufacture of certain computers are still fuzzy. The engine 
vibration control computers (installed on the Falcon 2000) and 
brake temperature monitoring computers that equip the entire 
Airbus line, the Boeing 747-400, and McDonnell Douglas's MD-11 
will reportedly transfer to Sextant. The tire pressure indicator 
(TPIS) computers that Mors developed in collaboration with the 
English firm Westland are tied up in an unfair competition suit 
brought by the Labinal group. Once it is settled, the TPISs 
could also pass into Sextant's hands. 
  Finally, Mors will hang on to business in two emerging 
fields: modular avionics, for which it is developing a HUMS 
(Health and Usage Monitoring System) computer to track the aging 
of helicopters in cooperation with Eurocopter; and aircraft 
mobile telephones (TFTS). It has been chosen as the supplier of 
Jetphone, a joint venture of France Telecom and British Telecom.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "Aerospatiale and Saft Combine </F>
Their Thermal Battery Businesses"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] By pooling their expertise in thermal 
batteries, the two French market leaders have boosted their 
subsidiary to number one in Europe, and number two worldwide. 
But the real goal is to capture market shares. Ariane 5 has just 
opened up a new outlet in the non-military sector. 
  The creation of ASB (Aerospatiale Batteries) brings 
Aerospatiale-Missiles' expertise in thermal batteries to the 
open market. Until now, the company had channeled its production 
exclusively into its own missiles. Meanwhile, Saft, which did 
not enter the market until the 1980s, was Matra's battery 
supplier and did 70 percent of its turnover with that company. 
By merging their thermal battery businesses into the joint 
subsidiary ASB, the two firms have given themselves the 
technical and financial wherewithal to capture new markets, 
notably in the United States, where they aim to break the 
monopoly of the American firm Eagle Picher and become a second 
suppplier for American missiles. Aerospatiale-Missiles holds 
71.8 percent of the capital of the new joint venture, and Saft 
(Alcatel group) 28.2 percent. 
  As of ASB's creation, Aerospatiale had manufactured 750,000 
batteries for its own missiles, and Saft 100,000. 
  Thermal batteries are presently used mainly as a source of 
primary energy for missiles. But they also supply energy for 
artillery shells, proximity fuses, laser-guided bombs, torpedos, 
and so on. Now that the Ariane 5 program has opted to use ASB 
thermal batteries, space has become a new application. Thermal 
batteries in rockets will supply the energy needed to position 
powder-acceleration-stage nozzles during separation, to prevent 
any risk of collision with the rocket's main body. This new 
space application--which is also ASB's first contract since its 
creation--is, according to Hugues de Galzain, a precursor of 
more diversified applications to come. The Franco-Swedish 
"Bonus" program should extend military applications to smart 
munitions. And De Galzain believes there is a non-military 
market potential as well, notably in the area of safety systems, 
including energy for aircraft backup power, ejectable seats, 
satellites, and alarm, safety, opening, and shutdown systems, 
among others. 
  Thermal batteries offer a reliable, always-available energy 
source. Unlike other types of batteries, "which run down even 
when not in use," thermal batteries can conserve their energy 
indefinitely (their specific life is about 20 years). On the 
other hand, thermals can only be used once, for three seconds to 
30 minutes, during which they provide power of 1 W to several 
dozen kW. To extend the range of thermal battery applications, 
research programs are underway to boost their maximum operating 
time from 30 minutes to 1 hour, or even 2 hours in the United 
States. 
  As with all batteries, thermal batteries employ an anode, an 
electrolyte, and a cathode. In thermal versions, however, the 
electrolyte is dry, and does not liquefy and become active until 
it is heated to over 100ë. Thermal batteries are made by 
stacking up electrochemical pellets interspersed with heating 
elements (in this case, paper of a specific composition), which 
are activated either electrically or chemically. 
  All competing manufacturers use this same technology, says 
Hugues de Galzain. What distinguishes them is the means they 
employ to assemble the battery, which can make for greater or 
lesser automation. Hence the value of pooling the expertise of 
Saft, with its knowledge of electrochemistry and its 
international marketing network, and that of 
Aerospatiale-Missiles, which specializes in industrial processes 
and has automated production lines that manufacture its own 
batteries using the same high standards it applies to its 
missiles. ASB thus benefits from the assets of both its parent 
companies. This is especially true with respect to production 
automation, which has cut ASB's manufacturing [time] 30 percent 
over Saft's. To achieve that kind of efficiency, Saft's 
equipment from Romainville in the Paris area was transferred to 
Bourges, the site of ASB's only production center. Four dry 
rooms were built to house the equipment after it was updated. 
ASB also acquired Aerospatiale-Missiles' equipment and 
technology, which uses so-called glovebox technique. This 
simpler technique is made possible by the missilemaker's 
assembly methods. 
  Investment in the new company, which began in 1993 and will 
continue during 1994, comes to about Fr20 million. Besides the 
dry rooms, money will be spent to enhance productivity, increase 
the size of production areas, and modernize the production tools 
transferred to Bourges. 
  About 40 people are now employed in the new factory; five of 
them opted to transfer from Romainville to Bourges. Management 
expects to hire another 30 between now and the end of the year, 
bringing total staffing to 70 by late 1994. That is the number 
needed just to meet the production needs of the "captive" French 
market, which will generate Fr80 million annually for the next 
five years. In addition to its goal of increasing sales to Fr100 
million within five years, ASB plans to boost its European 
market share from about 55 to 75 percent. To do so, however, it 
will have to stave off an offensive by the American firm Eagle 
Picher, which is establishing a foothold in the European market 
through a 50/50 joint venture with Germany's Diehl.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Casamayou: "GKN (Great-Britain) </F>
Gains Control of Westland"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; 
COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The diversified British group succeeds in 
taking over the helicopter manufacturer after gaining control of 
over 54 percent of its stock. 
  It took the GKN group over one and a half months of fighting 
on the stock exchange to win its takeover bid for the Westland 
helicopter manufacturer. It had to raise its offer to about 5 
billion French francs [Fr] before the last institutional 
shareholders would agree to sell their shares so that GKN would 
own 54.4 percent of the Westland stock. Westland's Fr3.8 billion 
of aeronautical activities will therefore be consolidated with 
GKN's activities, forming a diversified group worth a little 
over Fr25 billion in sales, including Fr3.6 billion in the 
defense sector. 
  At present, the GKN group, which achieved sales of Fr21.3 
billion in 1993, is not very active (5 percent) in the defense 
field. This small activity involves light armored vehicles of 
the Warrior family (700 units manufactured so far), and Saxon 
wheeled vehicles (146 units manufactured). Its main activities, 
however, lie in the field of mechanical automotive equipment (53 
percent), agricultural equipment (18 percent), industrial 
services (15 percent), and distribution (9 percent). 
  GKN's interest in the helicopter manufacturer dates back to 
1988, when it took over 22 percent of the capital held by Fiat 
and Hanson, during the "Westland affair." This also gave it a 
chance to appoint two directors on the Westland board. Early 
this year, United Technologies, the parent company of Sikorsky, 
sold its 18.7-percent interest, so that GKN then owned 47 
percent of the stock. The group then launched its takeover bid, 
which was said to be hostile because Alan Jones, the Westland 
chief executive officer, wanted above all to retain his group's 
independence. 
  Actually, after the events of 1988, the Yeovil helicopter 
manufacturer recovered quite well. It drastically reduced its 
costs (at the cost of 2,000 layoffs) and doubled its backlog of 
orders (to Fr12 billion). In 1993, its profits increased by 60 
percent (Fr260 million), with sales of Fr3.8 billion, thanks in 
particular to sales of spare parts for its base of 1,000 
machines in operation. It even achieved a small feat, achieving 
sales of Fr2.5 billion on the helicopter market (with a Fr250 
million profit) while delivering only four units! As for its 
prospects, they rest essentially on the EH-101 transport 
helicopter, which it will start delivering in 1996 and for which 
the potential market is estimated at 750 units; and on the 
Apache combat helicopter that Westland will manufacture under 
license if it is chosen by the government. 
  With Westland among its assets, the GKN group will 
strengthen 
its defense pole and constitute a consistent line of military 
products well placed on the post-cold war markets: rapid action 
relying on high-speed (air and land) vehicles. Moreover, this 
acquisition should enable the new group to obtain some tax 
benefits, and to have a better debt-equity ratio and a complete 
line to offer during industrial compensation negotiations.

<F P=106> [Article signed Bd. A.: "Siemens Nixdorf Increases Its </F>
Productivity"] 
  [Text] The more you have the more you want, and sometimes 
you discover business reengineering during a reorganization, as 
Siemens Nixdorf [SNI] just proved. In 1990, the German 
manufacturer set out to find remedies to the crisis of its 
customer support activity. Actually, the contractual maintenance 
volume of SNI IT Service was stagnating, and operating costs 
kept rising. This activity could be expected to start losing 
money by 1995. In a first stage, Gerhard Radtke, the division 
manager, then decided to launch a reorganization designed to 
reduce Munich headquarter staff by half. A team of 10 managing 
executives--including the data-processing manager--was set up. 
Very soon, the group reached the conclusion that the entire 
division had to be reorganized. With the help of McKinsey 
consultants, the number of support centers in Europe was reduced 
from 30 to four, and the hierarchy was simplified. One half of 
the headquarter staff--essentially technical specialists--were 
sent to regional support centers, and the information flow was 
reorganized. As far as hardware is concerned, all field 
technicians were given a notebook computer enabling them to 
order the parts they needed and to access customers' records. 
This organization led SNI IT Service to subcontract the spare 
part logistics to an express shipping specialist. "In this 
reorganization operation, Udo Franz, the information system 
manager, played a major part," Gerhard Radtke noted. An 
important place in the set up, which he explains by the career 
of this managing executive, who rose from operational 
responsibilities in the field to headquarters before becoming 
data-processing manager. This business reengineering is not just 
a defensive move to face a crisis. It also means to be offensive 
since, confident that it is now more competitive, SNI IT Service 
decided to launch into the maintenance of other manufacturers' 
systems. According to Gerhard Radtke, business reengineering 
enabled SNI IT Service to increase productivity per technician 
by 40 percent in two years.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrice Desmedt: "Siemens-Nixdorf Convalescing"] </F>
  [Text] SNI [Siemens-Nixdorf] executives predict the 
company will not be operating in the red this fiscal year. Also, 
the company is finally offering a comprehensive gamut of 
products. 
  Whether wishful thinking or well-founded optimism, 
Hans-Dieter Wiedig, head of the Siemens Nixdorf board of 
directors, claims to see light at the end of the tunnel. "In 
terms of our operating balance, we should reach the break-even 
point this year and show actual profits next year." Because of 
restructuring costs, new losses will be posted for the current 
year. But top-level SNI officials apparently hope to put all the 
red ink behind them by next year. Of course, they predicted a 
year ago, incorrectly, that the 1992 deficit would be cut in 
half in 1993. Today, however, the product line is at last 
complete, and SNI has begun acting and thinking like a company 
with an identity of its own, rather than just a juxtaposition of 
Siemens and Nixdorf. 
  In the first 5 months of the fiscal year, turnover was down 
by 6 percent over last year at the same time, but volume of 
outstanding orders is 2 percent greater than at the end of the 
last fiscal year, and "profits have improved over the same 
period a year ago." Its PCs are increasingly successful, with 
orders up 87 percent from first quarter, over and above the 
40-percent increase in number of units produced last year. SNI 
had already introduced new offerings at Cebit (see LMI No. 576 
of 11 February). But some clients, departing from the 
mainstream, have shown interest in the RM200, a "RISC" [reduced 
instruction set computer] PC built around a 100-MHz R4600 
processor (a variant of the R4400) but with original 
architecture. The bus is on a slave card, thus allowing for 
choice between ISA [Industry Standard Architecture] and EISA 
[Enhanced ISA] buses connected to two expansion connectors (one 
ISA and one ISA/VESA [Video Electronics Standards Association], 
or two EISA/VESA). This machine, designed and manufactured at 
Plaisir, in the Paris region, will be available in July. The 
price (excluding taxes) is in the same range as a 
well-configured Pentium, a high-end Power Mac, or an Alpha PC: 
about 40,000 French francs [Fr] for an ISA 16-500 version with 
15-inch screen, and somewhere near Fr54,000 for an EISA 32-500 
version. The first RM200 will be delivered with Sinix [SNI's 
version of Unix]. From a technical standpoint, the machine runs 
perfectly under Windows NT (indeed, SNI executives say it runs 
NT applications 70 percent faster than a Pentium 66), but SNI 
believes there is virtually no demand for NT on RM200-type 
machines designed to support client applications. 
  SNI France has just announced the departure of Kurt 
Hollederer from his position as general manager in charge of 
operations. He is returning to Germany to oversee implementation 
and coordination of international consolidation plans and will 
be working directly under Robert Hoogstraten, a member of the 
board of directors.

<F P=106> [Article signed F.N.: "Cap Gemini Sogeti [CGS] Misses in </F>
Germany"] 
  [Text] Cap Gemini Sogeti experienced losses again in 1993 
(result, share of the group: -434 million French francs [Fr]), 
while consolidated sales fell by 7.4 percent, to Fr11 billion, 
and the personnel was reduced by 3 percent. The net loss of 
Fr212 million in 1992 was not an accident. 
  CGS is going through a serious crisis, due in the first 
place 
to poor economic conditions and to declining cost-plus contract 
activities (which accounted for 30 percent of its sales in 
1993). But the SSII [data-processing services and engineering 
company] is also experiencing a severe disappointment, 
especially in Germany, following Daimler-Benz's acquisition of 
an interest in Sogeti and the creation of a joint subsidiary, 
Cap Debis--owned 51 percent by Debis Systemhaus and 49 percent 
by Cap Gemini Sogeti. "Germany accounts for much of our 
results," the management pointed out, acknowledging that the 
creation of Cap Debis (Fr2.2 billion in sales) was "a 
significant financial failure." Moreover, "managing a 50-50 SSII 
is tricky, and poor economic conditions just make it more 
difficult." This is why Cap Debis, which owned 20 percent of CCS 
(the computing center management subsidiary), will become part 
of Debis Systemhaus, the Daimler Benz subsidiary. The resulting 
company will be worth about Fr6 billion, and CGS will obviously 
become "diluted" in it. Without the German burden, the 
management claims, results would be comparable to those of 1992. 
  The group will thus see itself forced to increase its 
capital 
by Fr1.5 billion. In addition, other assets will be sold, 
without any geographic disengagement. While management claims 
that their interest in the Sema Group still possesses strategic 
value, they acknowledge that they will take part in negotiations 
on the future of Cisi [International Data Processing Services 
Company], 36 percent of which is owned by Sogeti. The year 1994 
will be marked by the search for another partner, besides 
Daimler Benz.

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Rose: "EDI Players Team Up to Fire the </F>
Market"; first paragraph is LE MONDE INFORMATIQUE introduction] 
  [Text] Though embryonic, the EDI market has 
nonetheless won over 8,000 companies already. To shore up their 
positions, suppliers have just joined forces in GO-EDI, an 
information exchange club created under the aegis of 
SimproFrance. 
  Suppliers of EDI (electronic data interchange) products and 
services have just teamed up in a club christened GO-EDI (EDI 
providers group). Their goals are to share information on how 
standardization is progressing, to adapt their products more 
rapidly, and analyze the market both in France and abroad. 
Participants include Axime Ingenierie, BT France, Bull, IBM/CGI, 
EDS, General Electric Information Services, and Transpac. "Those 
seven players account for 80 percent of the market," reckons 
Christrophe Viry, head of EDI studies at SimproFrance. 
<H5>  Consulting Is Half the Market </H5>
  "This resolutely open club, which will not tolerate any form 
of bureaucratese, has been created to help boost your EDI 
sales," wrote Bernard Stoven, secretary-general of SimproFrance, 
to market players. The EDI market, which SimproFrance estimates 
at 425 million French francs [Fr] in 1993, is having real 
trouble getting off the ground. SimproFrance counts between 90 
and 120 suppliers, depending on whether distributors of software 
package are included. Over 8 out of 10 are based in 
Ile-de-France, where most of the demand is concentrated. In an 
apparent sign of a more mature market, many of the suppliers 
surfaced less than three years ago. In 1991, for instance, 30 
new players came into the French market, or three times as many 
as the year before. EDI in France breaks down into three 
categories: consulting, bundled software, and valued-added 
networks and services (VANS). Consulting (studies of timing and 
feasibility) comprises the traditional business of helping EDI 
user companies lost in the thicket of standards, procedures, and 
products. SimproFrance has counted 55 firms, which racked up 
sales of Fr145 million last year, operating in this niche, which 
takes in both big consulting firms (Coopers &amp; Lybrand) and 
small 
ones of fewer than five people. Examples include ABX Consulting 
(two people), Euroedi (3 people, Fr2 million), HB Technologies 
(3 people, Fr2.5 million), and Logcom (3 people, Fr1.5 million). 
  Also active in consulting are the big software package or 
service companies such as CGI, Unilog, Sligos/Marben, Bull 
Ingenierie, EDS, Digital, and SG2, whose consulting work 
supports product sales. "Of the 55 companies that do consulting, 
only 30 are not tied to a bundled software or value-added 
services line," notes Christophe Viry. 
  Thirty companies offering 45 products in France racked up 
sales estimated by SimproFrance at Fr100 million in 1993 (for 
5,659 units sold) in the second component of the EDI market, 
software packages. Four companies control over half the sales. 
Polysoft, one of the oldest publishers in the market, wrote 
Fr4.8 million worth on 1,500 titles; General Electric 
Information Services markets 1,100 titles; Sedinov, created in 
1988, offers 800 titles; and Transpac and its EDI 440 line, 
which has been on the market since 1983, boasts 650 titles. Most 
of the bundled software has been written in France, with only 40 
percent of it imported from abroad, mainly from the United 
States and Northern Europe. "And foreign products are not 
penetrating," observes Christophe Viry, who explains, "The 
Americans did not make the Edifact standard a priority, and most 
of their products, which are relatively old, still run on DOS. 
Their only aces are a competitive price and the availability of 
titles, which number in the thousands." 
  There are many fewer players in the third area, VANS. Just 
13 
companies market 18 services. VANS is the stronghold of carriers 
(BT with EDI*Net, France Telecom with Atlas); suppliers of 
vertical services such as Bull/Athesa with Allegro for commerce, 
and Brio for building and public works projects; and software 
houses (Axime Service, SG2, Sligos). According to SimproFrance, 
the provision of such services generated sales of Fr200 million 
in 1993, for about 9,500 mailboxes. General Electric is still 
number one in VANS (one third of the market), ahead of Transpac 
(26 percent), and Bull (12 percent). Together, the three serve 
over 70 percent of all subscribers. 
  On the demand side, the craze among French companies has a 
long way to go before it catches up to that of English-speaking 
or Northern European users. Comments Christophe Viry, "An EDI 
show there attracts at least a hundred exhibitors and 10,000 
visitors, while in France it is hard to come up with 30 
exhibitors and 2,000 visitors." 
  On the supply side, the increasingly competitive environment 
has sent prices tumbling. The average cost of a product for PCs 
is Fr14,500, or 15 percent less than in 1992. In addition, the 
position of players has been made more fragile by the 
reliability and efficiency of products, which have squeezed 
regular earnings from consulting and assistance. The rise of 
both Windows (currently 20 percent) and Unix (50 percent) 
products is also making DOS versions (66 percent) shakier. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: A 1994 EDI Product Guide </H5>
  SimproFrance, a public organization assigned to research and 
develop ways to cut costs and turnaround times in commercial 
transactions, has just published the 1994 edition of its "EDI 
Product Guide." The modestly-priced (Fr120), 160-page handbook 
features a series of standard forms showcasing the products of 
62 firms. Products are divided into four categories: software 
packages, communications modules, value-added networks and 
services, and consultants. Each product is accompanied by a 
description, a statement of the company's marketing policy, 
prices, and persons to contact.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Sligos' 4.7-Percent Growth"] </F>
[Text] Last year, Sligos' business turnover has recorded a 
slight progress. If Marben Software Engineering firm 
(specialized in real time computing and 
telecommunications)--consolidated since last July--is also 
figured in, total business turnover comes to 3.81 billion French 
francs [Fr]. Next to a constant size and rate of change this 
growth can be considered practically as being equal to zero 
(+0.4 percent). On the contrary, the net profit has diminished 
by 7.1 percent (Fr160.6 million against Fr172.8 million in 
1992). According to Sligos CEO Henri Pascaud, the successor of 
Gerard Bauvin--presently presiding over Clio, a holding of 
Credit Lyonnais charged with managing the bank's participation 
in the computer field--"The engineering (segment), which 
represents 35 percent of our business turnover, has decreased by 
2 percent." The finances, the second greatest component in 
Sligos' income (35 percent of the total), has recorded a 
6.5-percent growth. The means of payment activity, fueled by 
orders for memory cards and by check processing, has recorded a 
boom of 19.4 percent (Fr528 million). For 1994, Henri Pascaud 
does not predict any strong growth, unless Sligos gets new 
acquisitions.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "Sligos at the Crossroads"] </F>
  [Text] The software house Sligos is at a turning point 
involving several challenges, including a new CEO, a weak 
market, and uncertainty about its shareholders. Figures for the 
1993 fiscal year have prompted Henri Pascaud, who just succeeded 
Gerard Bauvin as the head of the company, to explain the year's 
stagnating sales (the company posted turnover of 3.81 billion 
French francs [Fr], up 0.4 percent over 1992 for the same sales 
territory.) Pascaud attributes the plateau to flagging demand 
from state-owned companies and a still weak market for Sligos's 
facilities management services. The group's share of net 
earnings totaled Fr160.6 million, down 7.1 percent from 1992. 
  Finally, although Credit Lyonnais, Sligos's primary 
shareholder through its holding company Clio, is reorganizing 
its industrial portfolio, current Clio president Gerard Bauvin 
stressed that the bank had confirmed its continued strategic 
interest in computer services. However, Bauvin also conceded 
that Credit Lyonnais's financial imperatives suggested a 
possible desire to share the financial burden of its computer 
holdings with other partners.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "SNECMA's Mixed Results"; first paragraph </F>
is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The group is still hobbled by a huge deficit 
of 804 million French francs [Fr], but has improved its 
operating results, which are now Fr273 million. 
  SNECMA's efforts to restructure and adapt are paying off. 
Operating results in 1993 totaled Fr273 million, against Fr103 
million last year, an increase of 165 percent! This was achieved 
despite shrinking sales that fell from Fr13,538 million in 1992 
to Fr10,851 million in 1993. 
  Financial results have also improved, rising from -Fr166 
million in 1992 to -Fr40 million in 1993. In all, current 
income, which was negative in 1992 at -Fr63 million, grew by 
nearly Fr300 million and became positive in 1993 at Fr234 
million. "What makes these improvements especially remarkable is 
that they were achieved despite a 20-percent drop in sales and 
without cutting R&amp;D investment, which held steady at 22 
percent 
of turnover," SNECMA [National Aircraft Engine Research and 
Manufacturing Company] is anxious to point out. 
  On the other hand, the cost of adaptation measures to SNECMA 
and to other companies of the group is one of the main causes of 
the severe worsening of extraordinary losses, which plunged from 
-Fr570 million in 1992 to -Fr995 million in 1993. After tax 
credits, SNECMA's net final losses, which were -Fr593 million in 
1992, came to -Fr692 in 1993. But net debt levels were reduced 
from Fr2,556 million in late 1992 to Fr1,120 million at the end 
of 1993, notably as a result of successful efforts to trim 
manufacturing and research and development cycles. 
  The result is a worsening of net losses (group's share), 
which have risen from Fr794 million in 1992 to Fr804 million. 
That figure roughly equals the period's extraordinary charges 
caused by the rapid drop in sales, which fell from Fr22,838 
million to Fr19,566 million, or a decline of 14 percent. Indeed, 
SNECMA's consolidated operating result has risen to Fr496 
million (Fr118 million in 1992), or an improvement of Fr378 
million. 
  Despite a still high level of indebtedness and interest 
expenses, the group has newly rebalanced its accounts, posting a 
profit of Fr48 million against a loss of Fr510 million in 1992. 
SNECMA management sees no improvement for 1994. It plans to 
continue and to expand cost-cutting measures, to offset a new 
drop in turnover, which may fall below Fr10 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Robert: "Restructuring: Bull New </F>
Version: How It Works"--first paragraph is 01 INFORMATIQUE 
introduction] 
  [Text] After being overhauled under emergency 
conditions, the divisions are organized as profit centers. Faced 
with this commando-style operation, employees and customers need 
an updated map of the group. We review resources and assets. 
  The myth of the national computer champion has vanished for 
good; the company must salvage what it can from the wreckage. 
There is no time to lose: Bull must become privatizable within 
two years and must again break even, while Brussels opposes the 
payment of state subsidies. The reorganization carried out 
briskly by Jean-Marie Descarpentries will give responsibilities 
to managers, but it disrupts habits, and employees have trouble 
getting their bearings. In the very short term, they must 
identify profitable activities and then follow the method 
already applied at Athesa: set up a joint venture with a partner 
and become a subsidiary. 
<H5>  Large Systems: A Stepping Stone for Other Divisions </H5>
  As Bull's sales decline (by 6.4 percent in 1993, down to 
28.25 billion French francs [Fr], with Fr1.9 billion in 
operational losses), large systems see their share increase -- 
25 percent of the activity in 1993. Although it is no longer a 
growth vector (new sales dropped by 10 percent in 1993), the 
Enterprise Servers division has an important mission. "I must 
maintain GCOS activity at as high a level as possible, while 
also following customers evolution, and in doing so serve as a 
stepping stone for the group's other divisions, whether Unix, FM 
[facilities management], or systems integration," division 
manager Francis Ackermann explained. Bull relies almost 
exclusively on its partners for the development of its product 
line, in particular on NEC for the successors of the new DPS 
9000/900 (eight machines sold so far). If NEC should decide to 
increase its stakes in Bull, it is that division that would most 
certainly benefit from its contribution. 
<H5>  Open Systems: To Make a Mutation Possible </H5>
  The Open Systems and Software Business (OSS) division alone 
supports most of Bull's technological innovation. 
  The OSF [Open Software Foundation] just selected Bull as 
leading integrator of the Network Management Option, one of the 
three building blocks of the DME, the distributed management 
environment. In addition, Bull contributed its multiprocessing 
knowhow to design Pegasus, the Unix server running on an IBM 
Power PC, which should be introduced in spring. A DPX/20 cluster 
(code named Mississippi) is also expected for 1995. In the 
future, these should suffice to improve Bull's Unix sales, which 
have been quite low although Alain Couder, head of the OSS 
division, claims that "the DPX/20 have achieved 50 percent 
growth since 1992." Finally, the OSS division is betting on the 
EDP [electronic document processing] card with its Imageworks 
offer. That division enjoys international fame for its work, but 
it must still learn how to sell its technology. 
<H5>  PC: To Take Advantage of the Market Momentum </H5>
  Although ZDS [Zenith Data Systems] is still responsible for 
a 
large part of the manufacturer's losses, it reported increased 
sales for the first time in 1993, 31 percent by value and 47 
percent by volume. Marking a pause last year, the agreement with 
Packard-Bell gave ZDS some purchasing leverage. In France, the 
appointment of Michel Aguerreberry (the former Agena CEO) was 
intended to mobilize channels (60 percent of sales are still 
achieved among Bull's installed base) and eliminate delivery 
problems. The Angers site will become the European distribution 
center of ZDS, and Packard-Bell will set up an assembly plant 
there. 
  The portable computer line will be renewed this year and it 
will emphasize servers. PDAs [expansion not given] were 
announced and the Compuprint entity (printers) was integrated. 
Now they must become profitable... 
<H5>  Systems Integration: Stressing Expertise </H5>
  Formalized at last, Bull's systems integration offer has the 
advantage of a methodology (Mosic) and an international 
organization, and its objective is to sign two major contracts 
per country in 1994. The new Systems Integration Services (SIS) 
division will target the branches aimed at in each country 
(banking, insurance, distribution, etc.) and distribute a few 
international expertise centers in some of them. It is through 
partnerships that Bull intends to develop its expertise in 
networks, images, telecommunications, or security. Barely a few 
weeks old, SIS will have to face fierce competition, especially 
in France, although George McNeil, the division head, claims 
that "Bull does not intend to become a service company." 
<H5>  FM: To Open Government Doors </H5>
  Announced with a flourish, the creation of Athesa, the 
French 
subsidiary of which is a joint-venture between CISI 
[International Company for Data Processing Services] and Bull, 
ambitions to convert government offices to facilities management. 
  For the time being, the board of Athesa International, the 
holding company in which Bull will have a 51-percent interest, 
is still not complete. "Let's not put the cart before the horse. 
Athesa must first of all meet the needs of Bull's clients," 
Thierry Breton, head of the Systems Operations division and in 
charge of strategy, explained. It will fall to Jacques Tordjman 
(the former CEO OF EDS France) to succeed in a belated offensive 
on a market where entry stakes are high. He inherited, in 
France, Bull's internal data-processing department and the CISI 
contracts. 
<H5>  Customer Service: From Maintenance to Service </H5>
  A recurring asset, customer service must increase the 
value-added content of its services and help improve Bull's 
image. Herve Mouren, head of the Customer Service division wants 
to increase the share of services to 25 percent, although 
maintenance still accounts for 90 percent of sales. As a result, 
the following will be developed: micro FM (a contract to manage 
6,000 PCs at Elf Aquitaine was just signed), network management, 
and multibrand maintenance. This should make for increasingly 
complex relations between the various Bull divisions dedicated 
to service. In spite of all, Customer Service has the advantage 
of having a captive clientele and of being the only division to 
make a profit, with Enterprise Servers. 
<H5>  To Specialize Sales People in Order to Ensure Growth </H5>
  One priority: to increase efforts outside the installed 
base. 
One mission: to make sure that Bull breaks even in 1994. Sales 
people are now specialized by client, by service, or by product. 
Each division head (products or services) and the sales force in 
charge of selling the products of that division have signed an 
agreement concerning the sales amount to be generated in 1994 
and the resources allocated to achieve that goal. In France, the 
sales force supports four national and sectorial networks as 
well as the regional market directorate created in 1993. "Each 
customer now deals with only one network so as to improve our 
productivity and efficiency," we were told by Herve Mouren, head 
of Bull France. Although it reformed its pre-sales modes in 
1993, Bull France, which had several general managers within a 
few years, cannot manage to overcome the paralysis of its sales 
force. This is due to a large extent to the uncertainty that 
prevails concerning the future and to the difficult 
implementation of the reorganization.

<H5>  "We Are All on Reprieve" </H5>
  [Comments by Jean-Marie Descarpentries, Bull's CEO] 
  Bull is facing three breaks with the past. The first one is 
symbolized by new relations with the State, which will pay a 
Fr8-billion settlement and give us a free hand. The second one 
has to do with the reorganization of Bull's expertise by branch 
of activity, and my job is to find 100 executives to manage the 
corporation. The third one will enable us to turn things around 
and restart sales growth through a decentralization that will 
give free rein to the employees' spirit of enterprise. The 
entire group is energized so that we can break even in 1995. We 
are implementing a program to achieve savings of Fr2 billion 
and, already by June 1994, we will make decisions concerning 
activities that do not show any progress. We could have 
disinvested from 40 to 60 percent of the group's activities in 
order to break even. In 1995, 90 percent of the activities will 
still remain within Bull's perimeter. Each division will have to 
develop its own partnerships. To those partners we deem of 
strategic importance, we shall offer an opportunity to acquire 
equity in the division(s) concerned, including the sales 
networks. Later on, the equity of both the employees and the 
public in the company could be increased to 20 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by VR and DG: "Bull Posts 5 Billion Francs in </F>
Losses"] 
  [Text] How is Bull supposed to attract new shareholders 
when it has posted losses totaling 20 billion French francs [Fr] 
since 1989? This is the basic problem with which the computer 
builder has been wrestling ever since the privatization decree 
was signed. What the company needs to demonstrate more than 
anything else is stability, but just recently it has closed out 
the 1993 accounting year with net losses of Fr5.07 billion 
(including Fr1.65 billion in provisions for restructuring) on 
turnover that had dropped 6.4 percent to Fr28.25 billion. 
Although the minister for industry has discussed the French 
company with NEC, the Japanese manufacturer's response has been 
cautious. One of its spokespersons said on Wednesday that Bull 
had not presented any specific offer. NEC also prefers to 
refrain from comment on the interest that was expressed (in LA 
TRIBUNE) by Peter Bonfield, CEO of ICL (whose principal 
shareholder is Fujitsu), in Bull's systems integration and 
facilities management divisions. 
  In addition to other steps taken by management to put the 
company back into the black, Bull is banking heavily on Pegasus, 
which Armand Malka, director of Bull's Unix division, describes 
as "a major project." This new Unix multiprocessor, based on the 
PowerPC 601 and scheduled to go on the market in early June, 
should quickly boost the builder's profit margins. Made possible 
by an accord reached in early 1992 with IBM but designed almost 
entirely by Bull, Pegasus represents the company's biggest 
R&amp;D 
project. Absorbing close to Fr600 million per year (or 25 
percent of the total R&amp;D budget), it also provides jobs to 
250 
people involved in the project--on the hardware side, at the 
research centers in Pregnana, Italy; and on the software side, 
for design of the future AIX 4.1 operating system, at the 
Echirolles center near Grenoble. Bull hopes to develop a chain 
of OEM [original equipment manufacturer] resellers, principally 
American firms, to sell these computers built in Angers. "With 
Pegasus, we are finally going to be able to met 80 percent of 
the needs," explains Armand Malka. Bull is still counting on the 
next-generation PowerPC 604 and 620 to satisfy needs in the 
high-end market.

  [Text] Is Bull on the road to recovery? If quarterly 
figures are to be believed, the French group posted an increase 
of 21.3 percent (6.2 billion French francs [Fr]) in consolidated 
sales for the first quarter. Bull management expects "strong 
improvement" in its earnings for the same period. Total growth 
"has greatly surpassed predictions," indicating "the first signs 
of recovery," the group's executive committee said. 
  The Bull Overseas regional area shows the strongest growth, 
with a 37-percent jump in sales, while Bull Europe (+9 percent) 
and Bull North America (+5 percent) have simply reversed 
direction. Bull's microcomputing division increased its revenues 
70 percent, including 132 percent for Zenith Data Systems in the 
United States. Total orders for hardware and software grew 27 
percent, notably as a result of big system orders from the 
Pays-de-Loire Caisse d'Epargne in France and General Electric 
Information Systems in the United States.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "Bull and Ilog Team Up"] </F>
  [Text] When Herve Yahi announced the "merging" of 
Bull-Cediag's and Ilog's constraint programming activities last 
week in Paris, the director of Bull BPA (Business Process 
Automation) probably sounded the death knell of the French 
manufacturer's artificial intelligence products business. 
  Indeed, the software program Charme--a product of research 
Bull conducted in the late 90s [sic] in the Munich ECRC with 
Siemens and ICL--was one of the last pride and joys of the 
Cediag product catalog, which also features the Kool expert 
system generator. According to Herve Hayi, Charme racked up 
sales of Fr7 to 8 million a year in 1992 and 1993, out of the 
tiny Fr60 million generated by all artificial intelligence 
business. 
  The deal is a lucrative one for Ilog. The "merger" product 
Ilog Solver (which Bull sold under the name Bull Solver) will 
benefit from the constraints expertise of Bull teams. Moreover, 
it will be virtually the only program of its kind in a promising 
market, especially internationally. The only solid competitor 
today remains Cositech, whose boss Mehmet Dincbas and product 
Chip also came out of the ECRC. 
  Finally, according to Ilog CEO Pierre Haren, the "merger" of 
Ilog's and Bull's two product lines is taking place without 
money changing hands. In other words, his company is picking up 
several years of investment by the French computer manufacturer 
at little cost.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean de Galard: "The Italian Defense Industry Is </F>
Restructuring"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] Seven companies of the state-owned group EFIM 
[Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial Company] are now 
under Finmeccanica's control. 
  In recent months, Italian manufacturers in the aircraft, 
aerospace, communications, land, air and sea weapon sectors have 
witnessed the formation of an incipient integrated 
defense-industry pole in their country. 
  In liquidation under court supervision since the summer of 
1992, the state-owned EFIM group had to allow Finmeccanica, the 
leader of the heavy mechanics activities of the IRI (Institute 
for Industrial Reconstruction) holding, to take control of seven 
of the companies that used to be part of the EFIM group: SMA 
(Naval and Air Signaling Company), Selsmar Italia, Galileo 
Vacuum, OTO Sistemi Civil, Microcontro, Officine Galileo, 
Galileo Siscam, Breda Meccanica Bresciana, OTO Melara, Agusta, 
and Elicotteri Meridionali. 
  Last year, the total sales of these companies amounted to 
the 
equivalent of nearly 8 billion French francs [Fr]. During the 
same period, Finmeccanica's military sales, especially sales of 
Alenia defense systems, represented the equivalent of Fr15 
billion. 
  One of the first consequences of this incipient 
restructuring 
was Finmeccanica's recent decision to pool the activities of SMA 
and Galileo with those of the radar manufacturer FIAR 
[IRI-Finmeccanica]. 
  The previous Italian government had marked its will to 
regroup the Italian defense industry around two poles: on the 
one hand, the IRI; on the other hand Fiat (with its 
affiliated/associated companies BPD [Fiat group] for missiles 
and ammunition, Valsella in the very specialized field of 
antipersonnel mines, and Gilardini for defense systems). To be 
successfully carried out, this restructuring implied that one or 
several companies belonging to the Finmeccanica group would take 
over the activities of Agusta and Elicotteri Meridionali (the 
only two Italian helicopter manufacturers), those of Breda 
Meccanica (guns and naval weapons), and those of Oto Melara 
(land and naval artillery, missiles). Since the previous 
government was unable to see the operation through, the new 
government will have to decide how to go about it--either in the 
near future, which seems unlikely when one reads the Italian 
press; or later. 
  Without waiting for this later stage, Alenia for its part 
has 
already reorganized the internal structure of its aeronautical 
activities with the dual concern of reducing costs and being 
able to react quicker and more efficiently on its markets. 
Headed by Nino D'Angelo and his assistant Ciro Cirillo, the 
aeronautical division of Alenia consists of three organic units: 
military aircraft, civil aircraft, and 
aerostructures--performing three operational functions: 
engineering, operations, procurement. As for the personnel 
division, it is divided into four branches: sales, quality, 
management and control, and data systems and computerization. 
  In the field of air traffic control, Alenia continues its 
worldwide expansion. Belarus supervising authorities 
(Balaereonavgatsia) just entrusted it with the construction and 
equipment of an air traffic control center (ATCR-33K approach 
radar and CDS-2000 display consoles, MARA computers to be 
manufactured in Russia by Buran, a company with which Alenia is 
cooperating). The first instalment of the contract covers the 
modernization of the Minsk airport.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "The Downside of Liberalization"] </F>
  [Text] According to the financial rating firm 
Moody's, European carriers could lose an average of 25 percent 
of their market shares when telecommunication services are fully 
liberalized. 
  European telecoms operators, most of whom still enjoy a 
monopoly on telephone service and infrastructures, could lose 
approximately 25 percent of their shares over the next 10 years, 
when the European Union fully liberalizes the telecommunications 
industry. Such is the conclusion of a study by the financial 
rating firm Moody's. 
  Some French experts, who cite Britain's experience, find the 
25-percent figure a bit high. Ten years post-liberalization, BT 
[British Telecom] reportedly still has 90 percent of the 
telecommunication services market in Great Britain. Moody's also 
estimates that competition from open markets could lower the 
market shares of traditional carriers by 10 to 15 percent in 
certain niches during the first two years after liberalization. 
  Generally speaking, companies such as Telefonica, Stet, or 
Deutsche Telekom, which charge high rates for both residential 
and business service, will be more vulnerable to the risks of 
competitive pressure than France Telecom or Belgacom. 
  Moody's considers BT a perfect example of a company that was 
successful in making the transition from monopoly to 
market-oriented carrier, for it positioned itself to be 
competitive in a totally open telecoms market. 
  European operators should nonetheless enjoy a solid credit 
rating in the medium term, since the process of 
telecommunications liberalization in the European Union will be 
much slower than in other parts of the world. 
  But their rating is still expected to deteriorate in the 
longer run, when liberalization--slated for 1998 or 2003 
depending on the country--goes into effect, says Moody's. 
Indeed, carriers will have to take on debt to invest the 
substantial sums needed to expand and update networks, and will 
be dealing with competition for the first time. 
  That being the case, traditional operators will have to cut 
costs to become more flexible on rates and withstand competitive 
pressures. The speed and timing of decisions will be crucial.

"Europeans and Americans Modernize Combat Aircraft in South 
America"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] American and European aircraft manufacturers 
are facing off over the enormous upgrade market for South 
American combat planes. Their goal is to renovate virtually all 
forces by 2005-2010. 
  Western manufacturers visiting Santiago, Chili, for the 
FIDAE'94 Show 21-28 March began to see visions of an enormous 
goldmine. Most Latin American countries, which were overarmed in 
the 1970s, now have only aging fleets of fighters, on their last 
legs, at their disposal. And for lack of financial resources, 
these several hundred combat planes will not be totally replaced 
until the next decade. 
  Until then, upgrading is the solution of choice. The scope 
of 
South America's replacement and maintenance market had been 
limited until now by tacit agreements between the principal 
states in the region, which were anxious to maintain the 
existing balance of power. But Argentina upset this stability 
last December when it decided on a program to update its 36 
A-4/A-4M Skyhawks and buy another 24 on the North American 
market. In response, Chili, whose short-term projects had been 
limited to the purchase of five Mirage 5s to accommodate 
increased staffing, issued a bid invitation to acquire 20 
additional aircraft on the second-hand market. 
  This rivalry has rekindled competition on all sides. In 
Chili, SABCA is offering a batch of 20-25 Belgian Air Force 
Mirage 5BAs updated by Sagem (MIRSIP), which are vying against a 
French proposal to sell 18-20 upgraded Mirage 5Fs taken from Air 
Force stocks (see AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE 
INTERNATIONAL 
No 1465). 
  Meanwhile, British Aerospace is offering 15 former Nigerian 
Air Force Jaguars, which are being presented as virtually new 
aircraft, while Israel has proposed a fighter midway between the 
Kfir C-2 and C-7 to be manufactured by IAI. Former defense 
minister Rojas's preliminary decision in favor of the Belgian 
proposal will bring a Chilian military delegation to Belgium in 
early April. But despite the Army's continued influence, the 
final decision rests with the new government which took power 
last 11 March. As it happens, purchases of future weapons in 
Chili have run up against a Congressional challenge to the 
current law allowing 10 percent of the proceeds from national 
copper exports to be used to fund military acquisitions. 
Moreover, a parliamentary investigating committee is looking 
into accusations that the Chilian Army misappropriated funds. 
  The stakes in Argentina are no longer purely military. 
Lockheed's proposal to update 18 of the Air Force's 36 Skyhawks 
at FMA (Fabrica Militar de Aviones) facilities in Cordoba seems 
like a first step toward a takeover of the company by the 
American aircraft manufacturer. The Argentine government, which 
is anxious to successfully privatize the military arsenal, seems 
so favorable to this eventuality that an agreement may be signed 
quickly in late May or early June. 
  Lockheed's arrival in Cordoba would be a serious threat to 
all European civil and military manufacturers, starting with 
Dassault. The latter is negotiating a contract in Argentina to 
modernize the last 24 Mirages, extending their life to 
2015-2020. The deal would be a considerable upgrade market, and 
would include the installation of a new radar system and 
"headup" and "headdown" displays. Lockheed is offering to supply 
the same type of equipment--without delay--on its updated A-4s. 
  Europeans fear a repeat of this scenario in other Latin 
American countries, primarily Brazil, where there are plans to 
privatize the Embraer company in late May and distribute 60 
percent of the company's shares to the private sector. 
  European and American manufacturers are thus well aware of 
the need to establish themselves in all Latin American markets. 
Unable to sell highly sophisticated equipment for now, upgrades 
are just the entry ticket they need while waiting for better 
days. In this respect French equipment makers, who flocked to 
the FIDAE show this year, have a long way to go. Besides 
American domination, the South Africans and Israelis are strong 
competitors. The IAI has a solid foothold in Chili through its 
ongoing modernization of 15 Mirage-Panteras, six of which are 
already in service in the Chilian Air Force (FACH). 
  In addition to aircraft and system upgrades, the South 
American market needs a certain number of operational 
"retrofits." In Chili, for example, FACH is studying the 
possibility of in-flight refueling of its Pantera fighters. To 
counter American and Israeli offers of Boeing refuelers and 
BAe's offer of VC-10s, the French group Intertechnique and SIDMI 
Co. are proposing an innovative, less onerous system that can be 
adapted to the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. It involves an 
11,000-liter, removable on-board tank, which can refuel four to 
six airplanes by means of a standard boom running through the 
cargo door, closed in flight. The French firms may team up with 
the Chilian firm ENAER on the system, which they would offer to 
other regional air forces with in-flight refuelable fighters. 
Peru and its Mirage 2000s come to mind. 
  The two companies are also teaming up on a ship-based, 
in-flight refueling system for helicopters (HIFR), which could 
be adapted to different types of machines, notably Chili's Super 
Pumas. All approaches are worth exploring. Sully Produits 
Speciaux, for instance, presented for the first time in Santiago 
a new single-piece windshield that is better suited to the 
large-angle use of HUDs on all type of Mirage IIIs and 5s and 
their spinoffs (Kfir, Dagger, etc.). Though equipment makers are 
involved in a front-line battle in South America today, aircraft 
manufacturers are beginning discussions for the future. Besides 
the traditional contest between Dassault (Mirage 2000), General 
Dynamics (F-16 A/B), and British Aerospace (Harrier), Sweden's 
Saab is eager to offer an export version of the Gripen JAS-39C 
by 1997-98. The Swedish fighter may be equipped with new 
engines, flight controls, and partly altered avionics in the 
meantime. Such a development may involve SNECMA [National 
Aircraft Research and Manufacturing Company] through its future 
M88-3 jet engine. The Russians--newcomers in this part of South 
America--revealed their ambitions by presenting their entire 
panoply of modern combat planes (MiG-29, Su-27, and Su-30) for 
the first time at FIDAE. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: Equipment Makers' Strong Presence </H5>
  A healthy contingent of equipment manufacturers and 
maintenance companies dominated the eighth FIDAE (Feria 
Internacional des Aires y del Espacio), which was organized in 
Santiago, Chili by the Chilian Air Force (FACH). The largest 
showing was American. Little in the way of new equipment was 
exhibited at the show, which is mainly devoted to weapons, all 
kinds of systems, and equipment. With 22 companies represented, 
France ranked third among the 32 participating countries, behind 
the United States (90), and Chili (57). In addition, Israel, 
Italy, and Canada sent particularly large delegations. 
Inaugurated by Chili's new president, Eduardo Frei, the 
exhibition received greetings from American president Bill 
Clinton and a visit by former British prime minister Margaret 
Thatcher. On the French side, no member of the government or 
general staffs made the trip, and few high-ranking officials 
were present. In this respect the French delegation, headed by 
Edmond Marchegay (GIFAS/French Aeronautical and Space Industries 
Group), was politically underrepresented and supremely isolated.

SCP-1 radar developed by Embraer and Tecnasa, slated to go into 
service in 1995. 
<H5>  Boxed Material: France's Position in South America </H5>
  Over the 1990-92 period, French aerospace companies wrote 
$859.8 million worth of orders from South American countries, 
and delivered goods worth $1.7 billion. The main beneficiaries 
were Aerospatiale's helicopter division (now Eurocopter), which 
delivered 75 craft; Airbus, which sold 15 aircraft despite 10 
cancellations; the ATR consortium, which placed 7 planes (3 
cancellations); Aerospatiale's missiles branch, which sold about 
35 Exocets (different versions); and Matra, which took orders 
for several batches of "Magic" 2 air-to-air missiles (about 50) 
and sold a few surface-to-air "Mistral" missiles to Chili. 
  Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, which took 72 percent of the 
deliveries and placed 66 percent of the orders, stand out from 
other countries of the region. Chili and Peru trail the pack, 
with 1 percent of orders and 7 percent of deliveries for the 
first, and 6 percent of orders and 4 percent of deliveries for 
the second. 
  In late 1993, however, the Thomson-CSF group made a 
significant breakthrough in Chili by winning an important 
contract ($20 million) to supply a "Eurocat" 200 air traffic 
control system, slated to be up and running in late 1995 in 
Santiago. A second phase, worth a similar amount of money, is 
still under negotiation. 
  The Franco-German group Eurocopter sold six "Cougar" 
helicopters to the Chilian Navy in 1993. The last of the batch 
will be delivered in early April. Other negotiations are 
underway with Brazil for Cougars and with Chili, where 
Eurocopter is offering the Navy the BK-117--in competition with 
the Bell 230--and two additional Bo-105s for border guards. To 
date, 65 of Chili's total 135 helicopters (including 44 Bells) 
are Franco-German made. However, Eurocopter has expressed fears 
that Chili will join the ranks of the local "common market" 
(NAFTA), which could add--as it has in Mexico--an approximately 
20 percent tax to its imports. Despite recent successes, the 
French aerspace industry still lags behind its main competitors, 
notably the United States, in South America. 
  The primary criticisms leveled against French suppliers are 
high prices, long delivery times, and seriously inadequate 
after-sales service. Boeing heavily dominates the civilian 
market throughout the continent, where ATR has nonetheless won 
significant victories. There is strong competition for the 
military market, in which Israeli and South African 
manufacturers have established themselves as upgraders.

<F P=106> [Article by Arno Noeldechen: "Experts Say Demands of Rio </F>
Environmental Conference Technically Workable"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Scientists, politicians and 
representatives from British industry discussed at a technical 
meeting this spring in London the options already available 
today for effectively countering the continuing increase of 
carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere. The experts agreed 
that one country alone cannot solve this problem [which affects] 
the entire earth. 
  Almost unnoticed by the German public, England is actively 
involved in environmental protection. The country orients itself 
very closely around the guidelines of the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 
21. Government and industry have recognized that there is also 
money to be made in environmental protection, whether with 
ecologically compatible, economically manufactured products or 
with the application of the science of management to gain 
control over environmental problems [facing] Britain and Europe. 
  In England, federal institutions and authorities perform 
more 
of a monitoring and advisory function, while industry itself -- 
without comparably strict laws or regulations as in Germany -- 
takes action on its own initiative. 
  As Sir John Mason from the Manchester Institute of Science 
and Technology explained at the meeting, the signs are 
increasing that the feared severe climatic changes brought about 
by the constant increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide will not 
lead to such rapid changes in average temperatures as had so far 
been predicted by computer simulations. Mason, who has been 
involved with the questions of global climate for nearly 20 
years, is one of Britain's top meteorologists. 
  Mason bases his statements on improved computer simulations. 
The great depths of the earth's oceans had until now not been 
taken into consideration in the calculations, because we had no 
knowledge of how great the bonding power of carbon dioxide at 
various water depths really is. 
  It has meanwhile become known that there are powerful deep 
currents between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans which could 
bring about a comparatively fast distribution of the carbon 
dioxide picked up from the atmosphere. Rough calculations 
suggest that contrary to earlier assumptions the oceans can 
absorb almost twice as much industrially released carbon dioxide. 
  In the end, this observation is in fact not comforting, but 
it does push the time period for global warming far into the 
next century. Thus, more time remains for the industrialized 
nations to substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
  Great Britain sees Germany's packaging regulations in 
particular as a warning example. They have led to increased 
waste export and not to actual waste reduction. In the United 
Kingdom, they are pursuing another way to encourage and support 
industry in developing and offering environmentally friendlier 
products and services. 
  Funds are being made available for this purpose in the 1994 
British budget. Clive Brewer, the British government's Director 
for Environmental Protection, refers to the growing world market 
for environmental protection technologies which for 1992 is 
estimated at about $210 billion. In 1992, Great Britain exported 
about $800 million worth of products in this market alone. 
Brewer expects that this share will show high growth rates in 
the coming years. In the meantime, British industry has already 
started to switch over to products and production processes to 
minimize carbon dioxide emissions and other environmental 
pollution within Great Britain, [something] which is also 
occurring in the other countries in the European Community. 
London emphasized, however, that this is happening first and 
foremost on a voluntary basis and that the government itself 
hardly needs to reach for specific laws or regulations. 
  Dr. Arun Watts, Technical Director of the ICI [Imperial 
Chemical Industries] Plastics Division, offers as an example the 
production of plastic foam from polyurethanes using newer 
methods of production. A non-volatile isocyanate is used as well 
as new catalysts which undergo polymerization at low 
temperatures. 
  Analyses of the environmental influences in production, 
manufacturing and reprocessing were done before coming up with 
an ecologically defensible product. This led to a reduction in 
all environmental pollution of about 30 percent. It is hoped 
that a reduction of around 50 percent can be reached by 1995. It 
was taken into consideration that plastic foam can be 
reprocessed by means of a chemical conversion. 
  A high quality polyalcohol is recovered which can be used 
for 
the production of a plastic foam with hard plasticity. This 
plastic foam can then be used for thermal insulation in 
buildings or in refrigerators or freezers. Since the energy 
content of the new polyurethane corresponds approximately to 
that of coal, ICI thinks it makes more sense to burn the 
material when it is no longer of use than to dispose of it [as 
waste in a landfill]. According to studies by Dr. Norman Grant, 
Director of Earth Observation and Science at British Aerospace, 
Space Division, the measurement data necessary for active 
environmental protection can be obtained using modern methods of 
spectroscopy combined with radar and other millimeter wavelength 
frequency ranges. British Aerospace could make its extensive 
experience in this area available and thereby substantially ease 
the accumulation of precise measurement data. 
  This is also true for moisture measurements and the 
determination of various gases, which are necessary before 
industrial methods of production can be changed over to more 
ecological methods. This can extend to being able to make an 
immediate determination of the precise moisture and water 
content of foods: no determination process with this level of 
precision and operating in real time has been available until 
now, as Grant said. 
  For example, radiometric microwave analyses can be made 
without touching or destroying [the object of measurement] in 
the range between 100 to 200 ppm in the frequency range between 
140 to 250 gigahertz and up to 30 ppb in the frequencies between 
22 and 140 gigahertz. This space flight technology of 
measurement is tested and, according to Grant, ready to be put 
into use in industry at a feasible cost. 
  Additional know-how comes from the English atomic industry: 
within the framework of privatization and restructuring of the 
AEA (Atomic Energy Authority), a (semi-private) National 
Environmental Technology Center in Cullham was established and a 
group of experts particularly experienced in planning work and 
monitoring technology was gathered. 
  In addition to clients from industry, the center primarily 
advises the EU Commission on environmental protection with 
regard to the RDT (research, technology, development) activities 
which are a part of the Maastricht Treaty. Part of these 
managerial functions are thus paid for by Brussels out of the 
comprehensive 12 billion ECU budget for 1994 to 1998. 
  Computerized monitoring systems recording [data for] all of 
England come from military observations which are prepared and 
offered for environmental work by Hunting Engineering in 
Reddingswood/Bedford. The firm supposedly has at its disposal an 
extremely precise set of maps. It was put together after 1984 
together with meteorological data and stations for measuring 
radiation. 
  It is organized in such a manner that government offices and 
the public can be kept continually informed about all changes in 
radioactive readings, Kevan F. Daykin, Director of Information 
Systems, emphasized. Unfortunately, there is at this time no 
possibility of connecting the German government's monitoring 
network. 
  Waste Management International Services, Ltd., works with 
the 
broad range of methods and techniques for environmental 
protection and with the clean-up of the soil and the waters. The 
company helps businesses and governmental operations to choose 
what is most suitable from all that is available in various 
environmental techniques. 
  [Waste Management] has a great deal of experience in 
cleaning 
up contaminated soil and advised Exxon, among others, in the 
removal of the destructive oil [spillage] after the Exxon Valdez 
accident in Alaska. [Waste Management] is one example that 
practical environmental protection can also be a profitable 
business of international proportions.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Chabbert: "Rapid Prototyping: Process </F>
Adapted to Conventional Machinery"--first paragraph is L'USINE 
NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] At the heart of the process is software that 
analytically decomposes fabrication of the component before 
reconstituting the finished prototype... 
  A rapid prototyping process that does not require 
specialized 
machinery for component fabrication: This is the solution 
offered by a research team from Cirtes--the Essin Center for 
Engineering, Research, and Transfers at Saint-Die, Vosges. 
Dubbed "Stratoconception," it is adapted to work with 
conventional equipment such as milling and boring machines and 
digitally-controlled cutting machines. What's new is that the 
Stratoconcept software can also work with any CAD/CAM 
[computer-assisted design and manufacture] software on the 
market. "For the moment, we're focusing our efforts primarily on 
the Catia CAD/CAM, in partnership with IBM," says Claude 
Barlier, director of the center and holder of the patent. 
  Stratoconcept inputs the specifications for the 
computer-designed part, decomposes it into a number of basic 
surfaces (of constant or variable thickness) called "strata," 
and identifies the reinforcements and inserts necessary for the 
final piece to do its job correctly. These items are then 
identified and fabricated directly, using two-and 
three-dimensional processes performed on plating materials 
(steel, plastic, wood, etc.). Like a three-dimensional puzzle, 
the various constituent elements are then lined up and assembled 
(bonded, welded, screwed, etc.) into a real part that embodies 
all requisite design specifications. The assembly technique, 
calculated by decomposing the part, takes into account the 
mechanical stresses it must tolerate during utilization. "In the 
future, we will not need glue or mounting attachments," Barlier 
explains. "We're working now on the parameters for strata that 
can be fitted together automatically." 
<H5>  Commercialization </H5>
  Cirtes has already put its technology to work for Eclatec, 
producing an operational PVC prototype of a lighting mechanism 
housing--a part that is 400 mm in diameter and embodies complex 
internal and external shapes. "The prototype took only a week to 
produce, whereas in the past they took 3 weeks," says Barlier. 
  But Cirtes can do more than provide customized services for 
it clients. It is also marketing the Stratoconcept software 
itself, alone or as part of a turnkey solution. The rapid 
prototyping platform includes a CAD/CAM work station and a 1,000 
x 1,250 mm cutting machine for micromilling, priced under 
800,000 French francs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "New Control Systems Yield Measurable </F>
Benefits"; "Preview of Hannover Fair: Emphasis on Automation"] 
  [Text] 
  Hannover. This year's Cebit has already received encouraging 
good notices from exhibitors and connected business 
associations. They make us hope that the economy has definitely 
bottomed out. Also this year's Hannover Fair (20-27 April) is 
expected to receive a positive evaluation. In the foreground of 
this huge industrial fair, its 6600 or so exhibitors detect a 
distinct change in the economic trend and, beyond that, 
indicators of future global technological development. 
  Market economy and technological development are never at a 
standstill. Thus the '94 Hannover Fair continues the tradition 
of displaying the latest industrial developments. One of the 
major items it offers its viewers is automation technology. 
High-tech solutions to problems are not only to realize perhaps 
immediately potential benefits measurable in terms of business 
economics but also to improve decisively such competitiveness 
influencing factors as productivity, flexibility, and quality. 
At the center of it are control systems, including industrial 
bus systems represented, among others, by the Interbus S-Club 
and fabrication routing systems. Great significance is attached 
to various aspects of quality assurance as well as to industrial 
image processing and automation software, because industrial 
control systems form the basis of automation in many areas of 
application. 
  Last year in Germany industrial control systems such as 
Numeric Control (NC), Robotic Control (RC), and Symbolic 
Programming Systems (SPS) had to suffer a DM2.3-billion-large 
drop in sales. Most of the SPS scraped hardly through with an 
only -5 percent sales figure, while NC and RC reported double- 
digit losses. 
  This decline corresponds to the situation affecting the 
customers in those areas where SP systems serve the entire 
capital goods sector, which covers machine manufacturing, the 
chemical industry, and the automobile industry, and in areas 
where the other control systems are used, such as the machine 
tool industry especially. 
  The increased supply of bus-compatible standard products 
furthers unrestricted communication. The increasing demand for 
software lets enterprises in the automation software business 
report the highest growth rates, so much so that even the latest 
developments, such as fuzzy logic and neural networks, are 
rapidly advancing into the limelight position. 
  Assembly and handling are, in terms of cost, often the 
crucial functions in the fabrication process. It may seem, at 
first sight, that the chief component in modern handling and 
assembly systems is the robot. Actually, however, for operation 
it does not rely on its "intelligence" and controls alone but 
also on peripheral equipment and communication with it. 
  The most important support a robot receives is from sensors, 
which today range from simple mechanical tactile feelers through 
proximity switches and photocells to sophisticated image 
processors. A high-resolution image recognition device, 
operating in three dimensions, compares contours precisely down 
to fractions of a millimeter, with a master pattern programmed 
by electronic discrete variable feed-in and then recognizes the 
finest gray grades, as well as color hues. 
  Assembly, handling, industrial robots, and automation must 
more then ever be viewed as forming one meaningful entity. A 
special exhibit under the title service robots serves to 
illustrate the opening of entirely new applications for 
intelligent robot systems. At the 25th International Symposium 
on Industrial Robots on 25-27 April internationally known 
scientists and engineers are dealing with the manifold 
application possibilities for robots. 
  Service Robot Will Be One of the Most Important 
Components in Production Technology 
  Hannover Fair hopes for better times; knowledge-based 
systems will be increasingly used for optimization of 
upper-level operations management 
  Among others there are also to be shown service robots such 
as, for instance: robots which clean, robots which maintain the 
drive box in electric locomotives, asparagus-harvesting robots, 
aviation robots, and robots which inspect vertical above-ground 
structures of buildings. 
  New applications for service robots are opening up also in 
medicine and rehabilitation, in care for the aged and 
handicapped, in bureaus and logistics, in municipal activities, 
in households, in hobbies and recreation. The "Helpmate" 
developed by Engelberger Engineering Enterprises TCR is 
transporting meals and medications in American clinics, not a 
novelty any more. Robots for steering medical instruments, 
especially in surgery, have been tested for several years 
already. 
  For care of the aged and handicapped the Fraunhofer 
Institute 
of Production Technology and Automation (IPA) in Stuttgart, 
under the direction of Prof Dr.-Eng. Rolf Dieter Scraft, has, in 
collaboration with European Industry and Research partners, 
developed an integrated system for steering 
handicapped-assistance devices. 
  Use of robots in the building trades is being pushed 
especially by Japanese manufacturers. The next decade will see a 
robot becoming one of the most important component of production 
technology. German suppliers are well advised to quickly seize 
the opportunity which this development offers. 
  The highlighting material flow technology and logistics 
(CeMAT) exhibit suggests innovations in all sectors of the 
economy, inasmuch as it includes not only material flow control 
systems and logistic service capabilities but also delivery and 
storage techniques along with plant operation facilities. While 
use of unitized systems for all material flow operations is the 
key to product line and plant layout flexibility, this concept 
also leads the way to more cost-effective fabrication. 
  The surface treatment technology covers an enormously wide 
range of processes, such as galvanizing, varnishing, enameling, 
coating, and in each case includes both preliminary and finish 
treatments. The coating technology, especially in vacuum 
metallurgy and thin-film production, applies to a wide range of 
coatings, from functional ones through decorative and protective 
ones to wear-resistant ones, which also decrease friction 
between rubbing bodies. 
  Vacuum metallurgy involves smelting, degassing, and 
remelting 
plants and processes in the alloy and thus principally 
material-making technology. Thin-film techniques, used mainly in 
both electronics and optical industries, continue to advance and 
are now applied to data storage media, mechanical and surgical 
precision instruments, also cutting tools for metal removal, as 
well as other devices for corrosion and wear protection. 
  Coating metal-cutting tools with titanaluminum nitrite 
eliminated the need for coolant-lubricant fluids. Great emphasis 
on thin-film technology is put by the Plasma Technology 
Initiative NRW, also called Pla Tin for short, and the 
registered Thin Films sponsoring company in Dresden, along with 
its member enterprises on company-owned sites in Halle 6. 
  The electrical engineering exhibit in Hannover is always 
active on a high technical level, combining classical products 
and applications with modern system techniques. Thorough 
automation of power plants and intelligent energy distribution 
are self-evident. 
  The most recent developments shown in Hannover indicate that 
the emphasis is more and more shifting on use of knowledge-based 
systems in higher levels of management engineering, i.e., they 
will be used not only as process control support but also 
increasingly for optimization of upper-level operations 
management. 
  Flexible adaptations are also taking place in the building 
industry, where they lead to profiles in installation layout and 
illumination design. Modern market-oriented systems for building 
automation have already been standardized and are available at 
various stages of construction; ideas and stimuli coming from 
various sources are gathered under a common roof in construction 
management engineering. A decisive role is, moreover, played 
here by cost savings in heat, air-conditioning, and ventilation. 
  For illumination, design interest focuses on energy-saving, 
innovative, and durable products. A long life is, for instance, 
ensured by the QL-induction lighting system. For decorative 
illumination, increasing use, besides halogen incandescent 
lamps, is made of much-improved-color high-pressure sodium vapor 
lamps. 
  Now, just as before, the most popular light source is the 
fluorescent lamp, electronic circuits having been developed for 
its operation on direct or alternating current, with significant 
reduction of the otherwise relatively high power losses. 
  In the field of plant construction and modern materials, 
Hannover hosts not only the globally active industrial firms in 
their own pavilions but also many small and medium-sized 
enterprises in the consulting and engineering services business. 
  The open-grounds-type exhibition strongly emphasizes energy 
saving, material recycling, environmental engineering, sewage 
disposal, and pollution abatement. One inquires here about 
know-how in implementing project plans up to the 
ready-for-delivery stage. The exhibition program is supplemented 
with industrial facilities, special-purpose vehicles, rail 
transport vehicles, caterpillars for open-pit mining, roller 
macrobearings, cranes, hoists, and farming equipment. 
  After being absent in Hannover for two successive years, the 
air compressor industry makes its appearance again with broad 
diversity of applications. Compressors in various different 
configurations are shown, as are various compressor plant 
concepts for compressed-air conditioning and distribution, with 
special attention to the attendant electronics. 
  The exhibit includes compressed-air tools for oilless or air 
with oil operation, drilling and milling machines, high-speed 
tools, semiautomatic and fully automatic lathes. Welding smoke 
exhaust facilities, worker protection and safety equipment, 
manual and electrically operated tools complete the exhibit. 
  Ever more attention is paid to certification in accordance 
with the DIN ISO [German industrial standards; International 
Standardization Organization] in delivery of components and 
supplies, where the trend is toward the system approach. 
Independent institutions such as the German Association for 
Quality Assurance (DQS) and the Dekra or facility of 
Associations for Technical Inspection (TUeV) Cert examine and 
evaluate the organization and the procedures in an enterprise. 
Only after a rigorous quality test procedure do they issue 
certificates complying with the DIN ISO 9000. 
  A permanent part of the Hannover Fair has for many years 
been 
the "market before the market," meaning the research and 
technology market. Also the European European Patent Office 
(EPA) participates in the Hannover Fair, to a larger extent than 
has been reported on previous occasions, the aim being to make 
dormant resources disclosed in patents available to qualified 
members of the public. 
  Reports issued by the European Patent Office indicate that 
about DM30 billion are lost annually and that still a 
considerable part of research funds is being poured into 
development of already patented products. At a time when 
hundreds of thousands of jobs are sought in Europe, the Patent 
Office has assumed the task of making knowledge marketable, of 
stimulating ideas, of seizing on development trends, and of 
bringing innovators together with financiers. In collaboration 
with large-scale research institutes, universities, colleges, 
and industrial research departments, the Patent Office paves the 
way for transfer of knowledge into the technical domain. 
  The convention program offers a diverse abundance of 
domestic 
and international seminars and conferences, technoeconimical 
forums, technical high lights, finance of political and market 
strategies. By way of "short cuts" the Hannover Fair compresses 
into eight days the search for new developments, the scanning of 
global engineering trends, and detailed inquiries about the 
various specialty areas. A technology data bank and a reliable 
research forum are the support needed for innovative 
communication.

  [Text] Frankfurt. The Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center has 
developed a micropump whose central element is a thin diaphragm 
made of polyimide. The approximately one-micrometer-thick film 
is stabile up to 400ëC. In the various chambers of the pump 
housing made by means of injection molding from the chemically 
unreactive material polysulfone, the plastic film is the 
diaphragm for the pump as well as the diaphragm for the passive 
inlet and outlet valves. A 0.25-micrometer copper heating spiral 
positioned on the diaphragm by means of thin film technology and 
photolithography heats up a gas or liquid in the pump chamber. 
The medium which is to be delivered [by the pump] is transported 
along by means of the heat expansion, according to the Karlsruhe 
Nuclear Research Center GmbH (Coordination and Technology 
Transfer, P.O. Box 3640, 76021 Karlsruhe: Telephone 07 247-82 55 
80). The pump allegedly produces a pressure of 130 mbar. It can 
transport up to 0.2 milliliter per minute at a pump frequency of 
30 hertz. The 7 x 10 millimeter pump can be operated by battery.

<F P=106> [Article by Giampiero Di Santo: "Fiat's New Challenge Comes </F>
From Melfi"] 
  [Text] If the first Henry Ford, the inventor of the 
assembly line, and Charlie Chaplin, the director and actor in 
Modern Times, were to walk through the entrance of the SATA 
[Advanced Technology Automobile Company] arm-in-arm, they would 
be amazed. 
  Yes, because here at Melfi, in a plain that is green in 
spring and parched by the sun in the summer, nothing is left of 
the world that was created by the former and described by the 
latter. Even the blue overalls have been replaced by purple 
work clothes. Not even the infernal work schedules that spurred 
on the protagonists of Chaplin's film remain, and neither does 
the continuous line that forced the workers to make the same 
movements all the time. 
  Here, in a factory that tries to do as little damage to the 
environment as possible (its base is sand colored, the upper 
part is painted with blue and gray horizontal bands), the latest 
challenge from the Fiat company, the Punto, is being produced. 
Three hundred and fifty automobiles are produced each day. The 
number will rise to 400 in June, and 1,600 when the integrated 
factory is working at full capacity (about 450,000 vehicles per 
year) with those employed in the plant and the subcontractors 
totalling 9,000 workers. Everything is automated, from where the 
sheet steel enters the two Weingarden lines that prepare it for 
pressing, to the three Schuler and Komatsu 3,200- and 
4,800-tonne presses (that will soon become four), to the welding 
operations (each Punto has 3,500 welding points), to the 
painting (performed by a Smart robot produced by Comau of the 
Fiat group) up to the point where it leaves the factory 20.8 
hours later. Everything is synchronized in accordance with 
just-in-time logic. The suppliers supply the lines day by day 
and in accordance with production requirements. Their factories 
are there, inside the fence that encloses an area of 2.7 million 
square meters. They have at their disposal a 700-thousand 
square meter area and the so-called highway inside the 
production lines that is used to transport the materials right 
up to the point where they are required for production. There 
are now six suppliers, but installations for another 12 are 
ready. The area is surrounded by a four-lane circular road, and 
there is a railway terminal that will be used for dispatching 
the vehicles once it is finished. For the time being, 
transporter trucks are being used to shuttle back and forth 
along the Naples-Bari highway. 
  Giovanni Agnelli's Fiat is launching its challenge to 
competition from this corner of the South between Basilicata 
(Melfi is in the province of Potenza), Campagnia, and Puglia. 
Innovation, flexibility and participation are the words that 
recur most frequently in the vocabulary of the managers in Corso 
Marconi [Fiat headquarters]. Here, between the robots and 
intelligent trolleys that only move when it is necessary, 
"Fordism," the immutable process that could not be stopped, is 
truly dead. Everything can change rapidly, and the workers 
participate in the management with ideas and proposals for 
improvement. The office block no longer exists. The clerks 
work side-by-side with the workers. The levels of hierarchy 
have been reduced from seven to five. 
  There is a training center nearby that prepares a general 
worker in four weeks, and a specialist in four months. The 
suppliers are involved in the design of the product and in the 
study of possible improvements. In short, there is a change of 
direction to achieve ambitious objectives: When the factory is 
working flat out each employee will produce 79 Puntos a year, 
compared with an average of 48 for the industry worldwide. 
  San Nicola di Melfi is a laboratory therefore. New theories 
are being tested, new foundations are being laid for industrial 
relations, original shifts and work hours are being studied (at 
present there are two but they will become three), the variable 
part of the salary is dependent on three different factors (the 
efficiency of the UTE, the so-called Elementary Technological 
Unit, the efficiency of the workshop, and the efficiency of the 
company). However, in every laboratory there is a danger that 
the field trials will disappoint the expectations. They are 
keeping their fingers crossed at Fiat. The company has invested 
3.316 trillion lire (1.355 trillion lire from the government) in 
Melfi.

be able to be operated with much less energy expenditure than 
has previously been the case thanks to the introduction of new 
ferroelectric liquid crystals. These liquid crystals can 
maintain their state even without a constant current. Characters 
and graphics displayed once can be erased by a short electrical 
current surge. Transportable computers like laptops, notebooks, 
and the like, equipped with such displays, can operate for a 
considerably longer period on one battery charge. 
  Ferroelectric liquid crystals are capable of changing their 
orientation under the influence of a current pulse, in the 
course of which they adjust the direction of polarization of the 
incident light. Sandwiched between two extensive polarization 
filters with correspondingly crossed polarization directions, 
the liquid crystals of the display panel turn bright or dark, 
depending on their orientation. 
  Viewed electrochemically, the ferroelectric liquid crystals 
are bistable. Electronics engineers at Thorn EMI in Hayes, 
Middlesex, Great Britain, also refer to the crystals as 
"electronic paper" because the text or graphics need only be 
created electronically and then remain. 
  So far, Thorn EMI has had a liquid crystal display with a 
13-cm picture diagonal. The company hopes to bring the first 
practical text-reading system to production readiness in about 6 
to 10 months. In the past, ferroelectric liquid crystals have 
been used to create color picture and minutely staged gray 
values on liquid crystal screens. Now by combining the switching 
properties of the liquid crystals with color-producing factors, 
it is possible to achieve the color manifestations by means of 
very rapid back and forth switching. 
  The "standing" color pictures with ferroelectric liquid 
crystals also require a background illumination to make the 
pixels visible. However, Thorn EMI (Department of Security and 
Electronics, Hayes, Middlesex UB3 8AT, United Kingdom) reports, 
the amount of energy expended is much less than conventionally 
used liquid crystal screens, which require a constant current.

  [Text] A series of computer programs for visualization of 
scientific data is made available by the Dortmund University. 
They facilitate geometrical modeling and are to simulate the 
human visual system with its wide data evaluation channel. The 
Marching-Cube procedure converts surfaces into three-dimensional 
data arrays, just as they appear in computer-aided tomography 
and in numerical simulations. The hierarchical Marching-Cube 
algorithm relaxes the burden of the original algorithm, namely 
delivering a very large number of surface elements, and thus 
speeds up the otherwise lengthy process of graphical data 
displaying. As the Specialty Department Information Engineering 
VII (Prof Dr Heinrich Mueller, 44221 Dortmund) further reports, 
a variant of the algorithm was for this purpose developed in 
Dortmund. This Marching-Hypercube algorithm, the report says, 
uses time as the additional fourth dimension. By means of 
free-form deformations and superposition of raster images it now 
becomes possible to to create a continuous sequence of 
intermediate images between every two already existing ones. The 
light simulation process, with an LCD-shutter goggles, should 
improve the form factors in the radiosity process and be more 
more precise in critical situations.

  [Text] Light waveguides are mostly used today to transmit 
large amounts of information over great distances. The 
Laboratory for Technical Optics in Iserlohn, Mark Brandenburg, 
(Professor Doctor Burkhard Neumann, Frauenstuhlweg 31, 58644 
Iserlohn) now hopes to utilize these techniques in 
interferometers and pulse oxymeters. To this end, the 
researchers have developed an economical laser interferometer, 
whose laser light source and electronic components, which take 
up a relatively large amount of space, can be placed a 
considerable distance away from the miniaturized interferometer 
measuring head. Owing to the sensor's small dimensions, position 
systems, like the cross-table syste, can now be retrofitted with 
this interferometer without difficulty. This has been made 
possible through the use of a polarization-holding monomode 
faser, in which the light source is directed without disturbance 
to the measuring head, which is a few centimeters in size. In 
addition, a pulse oxymeter for the determination of blood oxygen 
content has been developed in cooperation with the Mark 
Brandenburg Company for Medical Developments mbH in 
Luedenscheid. By employing a faser sensor, this instrument can 
now also be used with nuclear spin tomographs. The light is 
detected and evaluated in the patient's illuminated finger. The 
photograph [see original] shows the measuring head set on a 
control path.

<F P=106> [Article by Paul Loubiere: "Major Step Forward For European </F>
Silicon Chips"] 
  [Text] France Telecom and the CEA (Atomic Energy 
Commission) have developed a new engraving technique for 
electronic silicon chips which should allow Europe catch up in 
this strategic sector. 
  The end of the European inferiority complex in 
semiconductors, an area largely dominated by Japan, the United 
States, and South East Asia, is in sight. The CEA and France 
Telecom, who are jointly conducting research on electronic 
components, have just developed a new engraving technique on 
logic silicon circuits, an essential technique for the 
industrial production of chips. 
  This progress is important because Europe has been very much 
missing from the technological battle being waged between the 
United States, Japan, and the rest of Asia. At the end of the 
eighties, Europe was even becoming totally dependent on foreign 
supply for its electronic components. This situation was all 
the more serious because electronic components are becoming a 
major element in all industrial sectors from nuclear plants to 
aircraft, from watches to washing machines, from computers to 
automobiles. In a nutshell, the share of chips in consumerables 
is constantly growing. 
  The European Commission reacted a little late in the day in 
1990 when it created JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon 
Initiative), a research program grouping together the main 
manufacturers in the sector (Philips, SGS-Thomson, Siemens, 
Matra). A year later, in 1991, the CEA and France Telecom 
joined forces to form an EIG [Economic Investment Grouping] 
working within the framework of Jessi. The task of the EIG was 
straightforward: to provide Europe, within three years or less, 
with sophisticated silicon engraving technology. Both public 
bodies managed to meet this demand within the given deadline. 
  So what are we talking about? In simple terms, silicon chips 
are subject to two conditions: They must have increasingly 
large capacities and be increasingly small in size. "Think of a 
book," Xavier Dariel, an engineer at the CEA, explained. "If 
you want to increase the number of chapters without increasing 
the number of pages, then you have to reduce the typeface. This 
is somewhat similar to what we are doing with components. We 
are engraving logical circuits on to small squares of silicon. 
To reduce their size, we have to develop techniques to enable 
increasingly finer circuits to be engraved." 
  Currently the chips have micron-sized engravings, in other 
words the size of a hair divided by 50. France Telecom and the 
CEA have overcome the micron barrier to reach 0.35 microns, and 
will soon reach 0.25. "Our innovations have enabled 1.5 million 
transistor test memories to be manufactured which were perfect 
right from the first production batches," the EIG director 
explained. 
  Teams working in CNET [National Telecommunications Study 
Center] in Grenoble (France Telecom) and Leti (CEA) managed to 
succeed in the feasibility demonstration of this new technique, 
the so-called CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semi-Conductor) in 
0.35 micron technology. The validation of results should be 
carried out immediately at the Crolles (Isere) industrial plant 
and would enable the development of a 0.35 CMOS micron facility 
there from 1995 onwards. 
  The main innovations remain the use of deep ultraviolet 
photoengraving and mechanical-chemical polishing techniques to 
completely level the dielectrics (insulation) after depositing. 
They also involve the structure of the drains and transistor 
sources, the use of ultra-fine oxide grids or the definition of 
doping transistor channels. The interconnecting network 
includes three layers of aluminum alloys. The feasibility of a 
new deposition method of nitride-titanium distribution barriers 
has also been demonstrated. Specialists will value this. 
  "This technological progress opens up the way to future 
generations of 0.25 micron technology and less," the director 
said. "They will contribute to Europe continuing in the race 
towards the miniaturization of electronic components which, we 
know, will influence the competitiveness of a large number of 
constantly expanding industrial sectors." 
  Semiconductors are a strategic technological challenge and 
should be worth some 600 billion French francs in 1994, 
according to Dataquest (a bureau specialized in the study of and 
prospects for technology). The number of applications is 
constantly growing and the market could be worth a thousand 
billion French francs by 1998. 
  The geographical distribution of semiconductor consumption 
proves revealing. Consumption in the Asia-Pacific region should 
exceed that of Japan in 1995, Dataquest predicts, with an 
expenditure of $28.09 billion in 1995 for the purchase of 
semiconductors compared to $22.83 billion in 1994, and $27.32 
billion against $26.61 billion for Japan. 
  "We have raised our estimates for the Asia-Pacific region 
because we anticipate a continuation in the explosive growth 
experienced in 1993," Gene Norrett, who is responsible for 
semiconductors at Dataquest, said. The Asia-Pacific region 
should represent 28 percent of the semiconductors market by 
1998, or $26.72 billion, with China being the main consumer in 
this region.

  [Text] Siemens has decided to invest 300 million German 
marks in the production of semiconductors in its 
Ratisbonne-based plant (Germany), where the Dram 1's and 4 Mbits 
and logical circuits in 1 micron technology are being produced. 
Jurgen Knorr, head of the German group's semiconductor 
division, had recently announced that the company considered 
expanding one of its existing sites, on top of the planned 
investments in Dresden, in the former GDR. Siemens is planning 
to construct a new production unit in Ratisbonne, which will 
mainly develop logic circuits, thus creating around 200 jobs. 
Production at the new unit could start in mid-1995.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Flat Panel Displays: A European </F>
Challenge"] 
  [Text] ESPRIT Project 7701, European Consortium Active 
Matrix (ECAM), is a large-scale, industry-led project aiming to 
capture a share of one of the fastest growing markets in IT 
peripherals -- active matrix LCD displays. 
  The lead partner in ECAM is the Netherlands electronics 
company Philips, which combined forces in 1992 with French 
companies Thomson and SAGEM. The result was "Flat Panel Display 
Company," a joint venture company based in Eindhoven, the 
Netherlands, employing over 500 people. They have established 
two factories -- a pilot line, where most of the new 
developments are tested, and a full-scale production assembly 
line, the largest in Europe. 
  "Tomorrow's market in LCDs is enormous, because they will 
soon move from portable computers to all sorts of consumer and 
industrial equipment," explains Dr. Robert Hartman of the newly 
established company. We estimate a market of over ECU1.5 
billion by 1996. Unfortunately, the world's five largest LCD 
companies are all Japanese. They have a strong position on the 
market, so if we do not invest today we will always rely on 
foreign sources for what will become an essential element in 
many new electronic systems." 
  Started in January 1993, the ECAM project involves a total 
of 
19 partners from the Netherlands, France, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and Belgium, and is composed of 11 subprojects. The 
overall aim is to develop technologies and components to make 
feasible larger display sizes and/or higher resolutions, 
increase the number of potential applications of LCD technology 
and develop less complex designs and more cost-effective 
production methods. 
<H5>  Simpler and Cheaper Technology </H5>
  Of the eleven subprojects, the most important is "2S-3S Thin 
Film Transistors." "Briefly, 2S and 3S refer to the number of 
steps required to produce the LCD matrix," Dr. Hartman 
explained. 2S technology can be used to manufacture computer 
monitors, while the 3S system can be used in TV projectors. 
  "2S and 3S were patented by SAGEM's [Company for General 
Applications of Electricity and Mechanics] research partner, 
CNET-France Telecom, the French telecommunications laboratory," 
he continued. "The subproject has two elements: SAGEM and CNET 
are transferring both 2S and 3S as "direct view technologies" to 
our pilot line here in Eindhoven, and Thomson in Moirans (near 
Grenoble, France) is developing a "projection" 3S display." 
  These new technologies are simpler than those used today and 
use less raw materials, adding up to a less expensive factory, 
both in start-up and running costs. 
<H5>  A Complete Project </H5>
  In general, most of the other partners are involved in one 
or 
two subprojects specific to their interests. BARCO, a Belgian 
manufacturer of TV projectors, for example, aims to develop 
active matrix LCD projectors that can display video and data 
graphic images with XGA (1024*768 pixel) resolution. 
  In this way the joint venture combines specialised expertise 
from around Europe and ensures that the technologies have a 
range of marketable applications ready as soon as possible. 
  There are also four universities and private research 
laboratories contributing their expertise. The University of 
Dundee in the United Kingdom, for example, is contributing its 
knowledge of certain types of amorphous alloys to the SWITCHMAT 
subproject, where materials for TFD-R (Thin-Film Diode plus 
Reset) devices based on amorphous silicon alloys are being 
developed. 
  TFD-R devices hold out the promise of a low-cost, high-yield 
production process, but also have some drawbacks. The 
University's experience with similar alloys will help in the 
assessment and perhaps the exploitation of this potentially 
valuable method. 
  Other subprojects are developing additional applications and 
materials, examining future technologies, working on 
international standards and plotting the joint venture's R&amp;D 
programmes. According to Dr. Hartman, "We are quite pleased with 
results so far, particularly in the important 2S-3S subproject, 
and expect to complete the project by the end of this year as 
planned."

  [Text] Europe's semiconductor manufacturers are once 
again making gains after years of severe rationalization. In the 
new growth markets their new products have excellent starting 
positions. 
  When the Association of German Electrical Engineers (VDE) 
had 
evaluated a survey on the state of German microelectronics sent 
out to electrical engineering and electronics firms and 
mechanical engineering firms last year, the result was 
depressing: two-thirds of the owners and managers surveyed 
judged that Germany would lose its share in world leadership or 
had already lost it. 
  The magazine BILD DER WISSENSCHAFT also asserted in its 
March 
issue that Germany's manufacturers were threatening to "sleep 
through their last chance in microelectronics" in the case of 
application-specific chips, so-called ASICS. Current statistics 
seem to corroborate the pessimists: in 1993, for the first time, 
no Europeans were represented among the top ten semiconductor 
manufacturers in the world. And the Americans have taken over 
the leadership in production in Europe. 
  But in reality other facts than the bare market figures 
leave 
little room for self-pitying laments. Europeans are producing 
again in Europe and are investing, particularly in new chip 
factories ("fabs"). 
  --Last year the Finnish electronics company Nokia AB moved 
its color television production from Singapore back to Bochum. 
This was made possible by a new chip from Philips. The color 
decoder--the key to picture and color processing--combines all 
the necessary functions on a single silicon square. The advanced 
integration carried out by the Dutch company brings such great 
savings in cost that the return to the Ruhr area was worthwhile. 
  --A few months ago, SGS-Thomson opened Europe's most modern 
production plant in Crolles near Grenoble, where the 
French-Italian company produces semiconductors with structures 
of 0.5 micrometers, soon even 0.35 micrometers. 
  --Siemens is expanding its plant in Regensburg, where 
4-megabit storage chips--so-called DRAMS--are produced, and is 
building a top-quality wafer factory in Dresden for 2.4 billion 
German marks [DM] to manufacture 16- and 64-megabit chips. 
  --At the end of May Temic Telefunken Microelectronic GmbH 
will open a new factory in Heilbronn, among other things for the 
manufacture of components for infrared data communication. These 
will mean the end of the cable spaghetti between laptop, printer 
and modem. It is not only for the modules which integrate sender 
and receiver on one chip that Temic is assuming the role of a 
global frontrunner. The production technology which comes with 
it is also worth showing the world: the silicon wafers are in 
hermetically sealed transport cubes--so-called Standard 
Mechanical Interfaces (SMIF-POTS)--which are opened by 
processing robots at the processing stations. The new processing 
technology makes it possible to have spatially limited clean 
rooms with corresopndingly lower investment and with throughput 
time cut in half. "Here we are more than a year ahead of the 
Japanese and the Americans in technology," proclaims managing 
director Frank Dieter Maier proudly. 
  The investments are the expression of regained strength and 
a 
signal "that we are going on the offensive again," says Doug 
Dunn, chairman of the board of Philips Semiconductor 
International BV in Eindhover (see accompanying interview). By 
now the competition has noticed it too: Armin Vogel, marketing 
manager of Intel GmbH in Munich, notes, "The efforts of the 
Europeans in recent years have been significant, we're paying 
more attention to them." And when technology gurus like 
Daimler-Benz director Hartmut Weule talk about the "strategic 
significance of micrelectronics for Germany's international 
standing," the all-clear can be sounded: "We have not been poor 
relations for a long time now," concludes Ingolf Runge, director 
of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solid Body Technology in Munich. 
  The first and most important step for the European 
renaissance in semiconductor market is the regained 
profitability of the European quartet of Philips, SGS-Thomson, 
Siemens and Temic (see accompanying box). But not only the 
global players are winning. Small chip boutiques like the 
Society for Silicon Applications mbH (SICAN) in Hannover or the 
Microelectronic Applications Center GmbH Thuringia (MAZET) in 
Erfurt are setting up a high-tech network all over the country 
and are providing services particularly for mid-sized companies 
with special chips in small numbers. 
  And research institutions like the Heinrich Hertz Institute 
for Information Technology in Berlin also contradict the ominous 
croaking about Germany being behind in microelectronics. For 
instance, the Berlin information technologists recently 
succeeded in combining lasers and photodiodes in a component 
using electronic chips. The system transforms optical signals to 
electrical ones, and vice versa. In the near future this 
technology will make possible the cheap production of 
opticoelectronic components, such as will be required in massive 
quantities for the planned data highways. This masterpiece from 
Berlin caused worldwide turmoil. The American telecommunications 
giant AT&amp;T was among the first companies to acquire test 
samples. 
  The most impressive example of the Europeans' new strength 
is 
the production of socalled DRAM storage at Siemens. Until one 
and a half years ago the factory in Regensburg resembled a 
shredder for thousand-mark notes. The company pumped several 
billion marks into development and production. In spite of their 
immense efforts, the business was running a deficit for a very 
long time--until two years ago, when Ulrich Schumacher, then 33 
years old, took over the sector, which had been left for dead. 
With management methods like simultaneous engineering and a 
systematic orientation of the development team toward process 
and product optimization, the youngster achieved the turning 
point. Within a single year yield from the Regensburg factory 
nearly doubled, from 45 percent to over 80 percent, the silicon 
surface for the chip was reduced from 75 to 58 square 
millimeters, and the production process was simplified from 18 
steps to 15. Now Siemens is running the most rationalized 
production site in the world for 4-megabit storage chips. "That 
is our cash cow," Schumacher says gleefully. The result: While 
until recently Siemens' retirement from the DRAM business was 
taken for granted, now Regensburg is being expanded--and in 
Dresden a completely new plant is being constructed, which board 
member Juergen Knorr says is intended principally to produce 
DRAMs. 
  This makes sense because Siemens has turned itself into a 
technology leader. Last fall, it was the Munich group of all 
people, the ones who were always arriving too late with their 
new chip generations, who were the first company in the world to 
present a functional model for a 64-megabit storage chip, far 
ahead of Toshiba, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments or Hitachi. The 
race to catch up in technology has been successful. 
  And there's more. In important growth markets, particularly 
in ASICs-- special chips which are constructed according to the 
client's instructions--the Europeans are even leading the global 
technology race: 
  --An example from telecommunications (market volume: $10 
billion; trend: annual growth of 15 percent). With the GSM 
standard for digital mobile radio the Europeans have staked 
their claim in a growth market which will take over the role of 
the computer industry within the next decade. 
  Those to profit most from the growth market in chips for 
mobile radio, besides the American manufacturer Motorola, are 
mainly Siemens and SGS- Thomson. Technologically the Munich 
company is a clear leader in the field with highly-integrated 
chip sets and have a market share of just under 70 percent of 
components for this high frequency technology: "Besides Motorola 
there are no manufacturers who do not use our semiconductors," 
says marketing director Rolf-Juergen Bruess. Nokia--number two 
behind Motorola in the finished product sector and at present 
purveyor of the lightest handsets--has now selected Siemens as 
its strategic partner in chip development and delivery. 
  --An example from the automotive industry (market volume: $5 
billion; trend: annual growth of just under 20 percent): the 
permeation of the automobile with electronics will shoot up in 
the next few years to up to 20 percent of the production value. 
Air bags, ABS, engine and gear control, air conditioning: 
nothing will function without silicon. But automotive 
electronics "is one of Europe's strong points," as Carl 
Muehlner, business manager of Dataquest GmbH in Munich, 
acknowledges. Temic, for example, has reduced the price of ABS 
chips over the last few years by two-thirds. At the same time 
the efficiency of the component has quadrupled. 
  And the Europeans are not letting up. For instance, Philips 
has already set its sights on first place in the electronic road 
barriers which are now flooding the marketplace. Bosch developed 
the Controller Area Network (CAN), a data net to which all 
electrical and electronic devices in the car can be linked. CAN 
could even make itself into the world standard. Mercedes-Benz is 
already introducing CAN into top-of-the-line cars. 
  --An example from the chip card industry (market volume: 
$155 
million; trend: annual growth of just under 40 percent): 
Pocket-sized computers scored a breakthrough in the telephone 
card; now there are further mass applications like health 
insurance and bank cards (see WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE 49/1993). Cards 
as a substitute for tickets in local travel are also being 
tested. By the end of the decade a world market of over a 
billion dollars for the chip card semiconductors alone is 
beckoning. At the moment Siemens, SGS-Thomson and Motorola are 
dividing up the business among themselves. The knowhow for 
future contactless cards is being developed here. Nothing is 
going to change in the market distribution in the near future. 
The demands for security and functionality are too elaborate, 
the price war too bitter. 
  --An example from the multimedia industry (market volume for 
all multimedia products: $20 billion; trend: annual growth rates 
around 20 percent): Chip producers in Germany have been 
developing electronics for digital television for years. One of 
the frontrunners is ITT Intermetall GmbH, subsidiary of the 
American ITT company, with research, production and management 
located in Freiburg, which introduced the first components for 
digital picture and sound processing at the beginning of the 
80's and is now moving to the second product generation with the 
chip set DIGIT3000. Philips, the largest manufacturer of picture 
tubes and the electronic regulators that come with them, has 
also developed the components for a completely digital picture 
and sound processing tot he production stage. That these 
preliminary achievements cannot be converted immediately into 
world success is due to the fact that the Europeans were unable 
to agree promptly on the introduction of digital television. 
Perhaps they will succeed now with digital radio (digital 
audio-broadcasting, DAB) where they failed with television. At 
any rate, chips have been developed for digital radio which are 
already being successfully tested in experimental transmissions 
by Intermetall. The preliminary studies are not so far advanced 
either in Japan or in the US. 
  That leaves the computer. Here the Europeans have not had 
much to offer until now. In particular, the program completely 
lacks the proprietary processors with which Intel was able to 
catapult itself to world leadership with no close rivals. And 
even attacks against Intel's dominance are not being launched by 
the European companies, but by Apple, Motorola and IBM with the 
power PC. 
  But there is sufficient knowhow in this area in Europe. IBM, 
for example, had the processor for its new parallel computer 
developed in the Bonn Institute for Discrete Mathematics under 
Professor Bernard Korte. Korte says, "We could do the same 
thing, of course, with a European processor manufacturer." If 
there were any. But the tendency to hold back is breaking down: 
SGS-Thomson has started a new business area, in order to enter 
the market for microprocessors in the near future. Philips 
manager Dunn, who is ruling out involvement in processors for 
his company at the moment, knows the golden rule in the chip 
business: "Never say never." 
  [Box, pp 96-97]: 
<H5>  "In the Black Again" </H5>
  The recovery of the European chip industry is progressing 
well: 
  --In 1993 Philips was in the black in the chip division. 
With 
a gross margin of 11 percent in the semiconductor sector, the 
Dutch company is among the world's most profitable producers. In 
1993, with sales of $2.3 billion, they dropped to twelfth place 
in world rankings, but "we want to be at least in eighth place 
by 1998," says Philips manager Dunn. 
  --SGS-Thomson is planning to extend its world market share 
to 
five percent by the end of the decade, which means doubling the 
current share (sales: $2.1 billion) and placing among the top 
ten. So far the French-Italian conglomerate's plan is working: 
for years productivity has been rising by 15 percent annually to 
the current $115,000 per employee. For high-performance chips 
which are being used for the regulation of read/write heads in 
hard disks, and for special storage components (EPROM), 
SGS-Thomson is unquestionably among the world leaders. In 1993 
the company was again able to show a profit: $160 million. 
"SGS-Thomson shocks pessimists," was THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's 
comment on the successful recovery. 
  --The microelectronics sector of Siemens AG will pass the 
break-even point this year, sooner than anticipated, according 
to semiconductor manager Juergen Knorr. Most divisions are 
already showing profits today. Next year, according to Knorr, 
the whole semiconductor sector will "yield a positive result." 
The growth in sales accelerated last year to 21 percent (sales 
in 1993: $2.1 billion dollars). Knorr wants to join the ranks of 
the Top Ten in the next few years. 
  --Daimler-Benz subsidiary Temic Telefunken Microelektronic 
GmbH in Heilbronn, sectioned off from AEG and German Aerospace 
as an electronics company in 1992, grew by almost 20 percent as 
the smallest and newest member of the European semiconductor 
quartet (sales: DM1.1 billion for semiconductors) and even 
showed profits. 
  [Interview with Doug Dunn] 
<H5>  "Good Money With Chips" </H5>
  The semiconductor head at Philips sees no reason for 
European pusillanimity in the semiconductor market. 
  --Herr Dunn, are we still dependent on Japan in 
microelectronics? 
  Dunn: The Japanese will always be an extremely 
powerful challenge. But the danger of strategic dependency, 
particuarly in storage chips, has been eliminated. Now Korean 
and American producers are in a similarly strong position in the 
storage area, and don't forget Siemens. There is plenty of 
competition. Along the whole spectrum of semiconductors things 
look even better. The Japanese have no processors, the Americans 
are sharing the market among themselves. But they have few logic 
components for special applications, such as in the area of 
telecommunications. There Europe is very strong. The Japanese 
always dominated in standard products. But client-specific 
solutions will gain greatly in importance in the future. 
  --How could it ever come about that European chip producers 
became so weak? 
  Dunn: The semiconductor industry is a part of the 
whole electronics industry. And things went very badly with them 
in the past. Just think of the entertainment industry. And in 
the PC sector we have no domestic market worth mentioning. 
  --But these deficiencies still exist? 
  Dunn: Yes. But in the first place we have harsh 
rationalizations behind us. We are earning good money again in 
Europe with chips. In the second place, today we are much more 
client-oriented and go where our customers are. And in the third 
place, important growth markets are coming into existence in 
Europe, in which we have excellent starting positions. 
  --There is no general awareness of this yet. 
  Dunn: Unfortunately, you are right. We must 
finally shake off the image of being perpetual losers in the 
area of microelectronics. That is not only inaccurate, but even 
counterproductive. If we have no faith in ourselves we will not 
achieve anything. 
  --Won't the good prospects in the new markets be useless as 
soon as Japan and America attack with concentrated power? 
  Dunn: Our foundation is strong enough. But the 
question is whether we should continue with our present 
structure. I think that in future we will have to cooperate even 
more in order to share the high cost of investment in research 
and development or in factories. At the end of this decade we 
will have very many virtual companies, in which manufacturers 
work together in a very limited way towards a goal without being 
financially committed. Together with SGS-Thomson we have 
developed a 0.5-micrometer process which is being installed in 
the new factory in Crolles. Siemens has stated its intention of 
taking a partner on board in Dresden. Motorola, IBM and Apple 
developed the power PC together. These are signs of the 
structures of the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Laurence Alary-Grall: "First Starting Block for </F>
the `Information Highways'"; first paragraph is MESSAGES 
introduction] 
  [Text] The new electronic roads will transmit voice, 
animated images, and data interactively, thereby opening up a 
whole new world of services and knowledge. "Information 
highways" are a huge public works project, kicked off recently 
in France by the prime minister. The following surveys the 
current situation and outlook. 
  France is setting out on the "information highways." The 
United States, where Vice President Al Gore is an ardent 
advocate, has made superhighways a top development priority. Now 
France is getting involved in the huge project, which was kicked 
off by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur during an 
interministerial meeting last 22 February. The goal is to 
install communication infrastructures that can transmit data, 
images, and sound interactively, throughout France. In other 
words, to set up the network of the third millenium, which will 
ultimately provide multimedia access to everyone. 
  Two major technological breakthroughs--fiber optics and the 
digital revolution--provide the background for the sweeping 
project. Together they obliterate the lines between 
telecommunications, audiovisual broadcasting, and 
data-processing, and will make it possible in the future to 
combine telephone, television, and computer in a single 
multimedia terminal. As Gerard Longuet, the minister in charge 
of the program, stressed during a council of ministers meeting 
23 February, information highways are going to "profoundly 
modify the way many economic and social activities are carried 
out: [they will result in] more telecommuting, new forms of 
educational and training support, broad access to professional 
or leisure data banks, and the introduction of services tailored 
by the television viewer or consumer." 
  The government estimates the growth outlook for new 
communication technologies at 8 percent a year, or about 10 
percent of Europe's GNP around 2000. This makes future 
multimedia networks of crucial economic and strategic 
importance, and explains the prime minister's plan to bring 
together all the players--France Telecom, cable companies, 
television stations, multimedia publishers, audiovisual 
producers, and computer service operators--in a "growth pact." 
The pact aims to raise several billion French francs' [Fr] worth 
of investments, notably in cable, over the next three years. 
"But the economic objective must not take precedence over the 
essential public service mission of these infrastructures," 
stressed Edouard Balladur. The prime minister believes the 
government should play a dual role: "To ensure that electronic 
highways are developed in a way that meets the country's 
economic, social, educational, and cultural needs on the one 
hand. And to make them quickly available to the greatest number 
of households, schools, and businesses on the other." 
<H5>  The Minitel Precedent </H5>
  The French initiative falls within the European perspective 
advanced by proposals of the "White Paper on Growth, 
Competitiveness, and Employment," which was prepared by the 
European Commission and adopted by the Twelve's heads of state 
and government in late 1993. In it, the Commission estimates the 
total investment needed in the telecommunications sector alone 
at ECU150 billion (about Fr975 billion) between now and 2000. 
European information highways would absorb ECU67 billion, 35 
billion to install a high-speed communication network and 
consolidate European ISDNs [Integrated Services Digital 
Networks], 12 billion for electronic services (electronic 
images, data bases, electronic mail), and 20 billion for 
information systems and services (telecommuting, on-line medical 
assistance, remote administration). 
  The Twelve set up a brainstorming group, headed by European 
industrial affairs commissioner Martin Bangemann, on 8 February 
to prepare the development of this "information society" and 
related new technologies on a continental scale. The group of 
experts will submit its conclusions next 24 and 25 June at the 
European Corfou summit, which will deal with the question of 
electronic highways and their funding. 
  In France, the national information highways project will 
benefit from a famous precedent: the success of the minitel, 
which now offers 23,000 services to 6.5 million 
terminal-equipped users and roughly 500,000 videotex desktops. 
As for Numeris, France's version of the ISDN, it spans the 
entire territory and can already carry voice, data, and still or 
slightly animated pictures. But its transmission speed is 
grossly inadequate for true multimedia and interactive use. 
  Hence the need to launch a new generation of "wide-band, 
very-high-speed" networks, which combine fiber optic equipment 
and new transmission and switching techniques, particularly ATM 
(asynchronous transfer mode). France Telecom has already 
invested heavily to equip its network with fiber optics. The 
public carrier is preparing to restructure its transmission 
network (the "national roads"), to convert it from a branching 
architecture to one that is "petal-like." It is also getting 
ready to launch the first commercial high-speed-tranmission 
services via ATM in 1995. Moreover, France has undeniable 
strengths in industrial telecommunication products, notably 
Alcatel's mastery of broadband networks. 
<H5>  A Study Mission </H5>
  But the performance level of a network is not the only thing 
to be considered. Much is at stake in the notion of information 
highways, including technologies, industries, regulations, and 
effects on civilization. What should be sent out on these 
highways, to meet which needs, and to provide what kind of new 
services? What should be the public service role of the 
information highways? Who will have what kind of access to 
knowledge? What sort of legal framework should "regulate" the 
roads--in other words, allow the flourishing of new markets and 
the jobs they will create while meeting general and regional 
development needs? How will the information highways complement 
cable? 
  The government has assigned the job of exploring all these 
critical questions to Gerard Thery, a former telecommunications 
general director whose name is linked to France's effort to 
"catchup" in telephones in the seventies and to the launch of 
the minitel. Gerard Thery will submit an analysis and proposals 
to the government this summer. His assignment is preparation for 
a bill that may be presented to parliament in the fall, before 
initial experiments get underway at the end of the year.

  [Text] Frankfurt. French scientists were recently 
successful in developing a silicon-germanium alloy which can be 
used for bipolar transistors with a limiting frequency of more 
than 50 gigahertz. According to the journal SEMICONDUCTOR 
INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 17, 1994, No. 1, p. 18), the laboratories of 
the National Center for Telecommunications Studies (CNET) of 
France Telecom have already exceeded a value of 100 gigahertz. 
Pierre Noblanc of CNET explains that the high frequency output 
is said to equal that of gallium arsenide transistors. The alloy 
of about 70-percent silicon and 30-percent germanium is used as 
a base for Bicmos products with structural widths of 0.25 
micrometers. Production is to begin in 1996. Advantages are 
anticipated for bipolar, Mosfet and Bicmos products. He said 
that in Great Britain the company GEC Plessey Semiconductor in 
Swindon is likewise working on silicon-germanium alloys, but 
with the proportion of germanium 10 to 20 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "French Develop Materials With </F>
Several Properties"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Every material has some characteristic 
physical properties. According to recent research performed by 
French material scientists, it will be possible in future to 
plan materials so that they possess several properties which can 
be built into them in a deliberate and controlled way. Thus it 
will be possible in a single material to combine magnetic 
properties with specific non-linear optical properties which do 
not occur in nature and which it has hitherto been impossible to 
produce. The basic principles for the production of such new 
materials were discovered and investigated at the Laboratoire de 
Chimie Inorganique of the French Universite Paris Sud. 
  In the view of the French scientists, the combinatorial 
possibilities are unlimited, and this means that it will in 
future be possible to go about creating completely new materials 
on the basis of requirement profiles. One of the first such 
materials they were able to obtain was crystallizing compounds 
which combine a very high magnetic value with the capacity to 
double the oscillation of light frequencies, that is, to produce 
light oscillations of the second upper harmonic oscillation in 
passing through the layers. At the same time the material 
possesses permanent magnetic properties. 
  The combination of these two important properties is brought 
about by deliberate construction of interconnected molecular 
structures, of which one component is responsible for the 
magnetic properties and another for the non-linear optical 
properties. 
  But in order to achieve this, the atomic lattices of the 
individual components must be made to interconnect. In the 
process, the structure of an inorganic compound determines the 
alignment and the intercalation of an organic compound. The 
developers say that the design gives rise to interconnected 
hybrid compounds which consist of both organic and inorganic 
molecules. 
  For continuing experiments the scientists are using "DAMS," 
short for dimethyl amino-N-methyl stilbazoline, as an organic 
compound. Because of its structure, it possesses non-linear 
optical properties if there is no domain formation with symmetry 
centers in the dipolar-type compound. In order to prevent this, 
these organic, color-bearing molecules are combined as 
chromophores with cations of a manganese salt and anions from 
phosphide sulfide. In the process a complex hybrid compound 
arises (MnO.86S3(DAMS)0.26), whose inorganic components take 
care of the incorporation of the organic molecules in the 
requisite interstitial structure, and thus causes the molecular 
orientation for the optical behavior. 
  The new material created is permanently magnetic up to a 
temperature of 40 ëK and doubles incident laser light over a 
relatively wide frequency range. The new material is available 
in crystalline form, but at the moment the question of whether 
it can be drawn out into thin films for frequency filters, for 
example, or applied to glass substrates in a few atomic layers, 
has not yet been thoroughly investigated. 
  The scientists are consciously refraining from investigating 
any practical applications more thoroughly yet, preferring to 
research the principles according to which the formation of such 
combinations of properties must proceed. For if these rules are 
known, a very large number of coumpounds can be synthesized 
which unite several properties, perhaps even opposing ones. 
  In some ways this method of synthesis may represent a 
complement to the sol-gel procedure which is commonly used today 
to build up new compounds from nanometer-sized components. In 
comparison with materials currently in use, which are designed 
to optimize a single property, the developers speak of a new 
generation of "two-dimensional" materials. If more than two 
properties can be combined in a material, "multidimensional" 
materials are also theoretically possible. For further 
information: Universite Paris Sud, Laboratoire de Chimie 
Inorganique, F-91405 Orsay, France.

<F P=106> [Article by Karl Tetzner: "Four Stages To Highest Television </F>
Quality"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. "Television was invented in Europe, and 
Europe wants to play a significant role in the digital age too," 
says the introduction to "Innovation Europe," sponsored for the 
fourth time by the Central Association of Electrotechnology and 
Electronics Industries. Television remains a significant factor: 
in Germany there are 44 million sets in operation. The total is 
about 160 million for Europe and 670 million worldwide. 
  The world of television is on the verge of emerging into the 
digital age. During the meeting in Berlin, Dr. Helmut Stein 
(Nokia) reported in detail that digital technology is now in a 
position to differentiate image and sound quality, i.e., to 
divide up the given bit rates as desired. But the price to be 
paid is some loss of quality. There will be four levels: 
  --Limited Definition Television (LDTV) achieves image and 
sound quality on the level of previous videorecorders. This 
requires a data rate of 1.5 to 2 megabits per second. 
  --Standard Definition Television (SDTV) shows TV programs 
with good PAL quality on a technologically modern receiver. The 
requirement is a transmission rate of 3 to 4 megabits per second. 
  --Extended Definition Television (EDTV) offers improved 
image 
and sound reproduction, sufficient for large screens, including 
those with a 16:19 height-to-width ratio and for the new PALplus 
system. Here the data transmission rate is 6 to 8 megabits per 
second. 
  --High Definition Television (HDTV) for high definition 
televisions with up to five sound channels is suitable for 
reproduction on very large screens. This requires a transmission 
capacity of 20 to 30 megabits. The data streams will consist of 
188-byte packets; a byte is equal to eight bits. Thus they are 
adaptable for the future Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) on the 
public broad-band networks. The first byte in the packet serves 
for synchronization, the next three for recognition of the data 
carried by the following 184 bytes. 
  As is well known, in the recent past over 100 institutions 
from 14 countries have been working on the technology and 
strategy of European digital television, and they agreed on the 
first standard (for satellite TV transmission) in December of 
1993. The norms for cable transmission and terrestrial digital 
transmission will follow. 
  In Berlin, Stein gave the following timetable: digital TV 
via 
satellite and cable will begin in 1995. Terrestrial 
transmission, received with conventional roof antennas, could 
follow in 1997 and the highest quality level (digital HDTV) 
could be available beginning in 1999. There is no longer anyone 
who talks about European HDTV using the HD-Mac transmission 
process, which was developed at a cost of several hundred 
million German marks [DM] and given an expensive demonstration. 
  Dr. Herbert Bruch (Grundig) explained what will happen with 
PALplus, the system which can completely fill the broad picture 
surfaces of the new 16:9 [as published] sets. ARD plans to offer 
about 300 PALplus program hours this year, and Baerische 
Rundfunk an addition 300. The pay-TV broadcaster Premiere is 
even promising 1,000 hours. But the equipment industry is not 
braced for this tempo. Originally, they had been counting on 
PALplus beginning in the summer of 1995. 
  In the meantime, some equipment manufacturers have been 
making use of ASIC chips. It is true that they are more 
expensive than the later mass-produced chips, but will be 
available sooner. In this way the first PALplus-equipped 16:9 
[as published] receivers could appear in the stores before 
Christmas, with a price increase of about DM350. PALplus is also 
completely compatible with the less advanced PAL standard.

<F P=106> [Article by HI: "Alcatel SEL Records Negative Turnover of 11 </F>
Percent for 1993; Two New Companies as Well as Concentration of 
Production Expected to Increase Efficiency"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart. The Stuttgart telecommunications 
equipment manufacturer Alcatel SEL, a subsidiary of Alcatel, 
recorded a drop in turnover of 11 percent, from 6.3 billion 
German marks [DM] to DM5.6 billion, in fiscal year 1993. In 
addition to the general weakness of the economy, the company 
sees the continuous drop in prices as one of the reasons for the 
loss. The people in Stuttgart want to form two new companies and 
close down a production unit to lower costs and increase 
efficiency. 
  In the words of chairman of the board, Gerhard Zeidler, the 
overall economic situation is also reflected in the number of 
Alcatel SEL of order entries. In comparison with the previous 
year, with a volume of DM5 billion, the people in Stuttgart 
received 20 percent fewer orders and had an order volume of 
DM4.8 billion at the end of 1993. 
  The German part of the company managed to earn a surplus of 
DM107.2 million in 1993, while only the year before it made a 
profit of DM160.1 million. According to Zeidler, this deficit is 
essentially attributable to the negative effects of volume and 
prices. Despite the general drop in turnover of 10 percent among 
suppliers of communications hardware, at Alcatel they do not 
want to get into the booming operator market, since a 
confrontational course with current customers is to be avoided. 
However, Alcatel will also further participate in the operation 
of the networks, as in Kazakhstan, if the carriers so desire. 
  To be sure, Zeidler does not expect his company to grow 
again 
in 1994, but he does hope to keep it at its 1993 level. As for 
the future, the chairman of the board wants to develop new lines 
of business, such as interactive television, corporate networks, 
and traffic management. 
  To lower costs and increase efficiency, Zeidler plans to 
concentrate telephone exchange and broadcasting technology at 
the plants in Gunzenhausen, Arnstadt, and Rochlitz and to close 
down the production unit in Stuttgart. The state capital, the 
chairman of the board said, "will continue to be the biggest 
plant, but with a new commercial focus." In Zeidler's words, 
"software and services should have a future" in the Swabian 
metropolis. 
  Furthermore, the company management plans to set up two 
companies. The mobile communications product department is 
supposed to be converted into a company by as early as 1 July 
1994. The detachment of the company's office communications 
department is scheduled for 1 January 1995. Zeidler has high 
hopes that these measures will concentrate authorizations to 
make decisions and produce better cooperation in the 
international Alcatel combine. 
  As a consequence of the reorganization and the concentration 
of production, the company wants to eliminate another 1,500 jobs 
by the end of 1995. About 600 jobs will be affected by the cuts 
at the Stuttgart plant, which at present provides about 900 jobs.

<F P=106> [Article by Claudio Donat-Cattin: "Iritel, Bridge Over the </F>
Mediterranean"] 
  [Text] Rome--The "telephone stew" is about to go into the 
archives. The MEDIA DUEMILA readers, who have followed the 
difficult battles that have taken place over the last few years 
to attain a single telecommunications operator, know this well. 
It has been a rocky path full of snares that the Tangentopoli 
[Kickback scandal] events have enabled us to understand better. 
  Today we are on the verge of forming Telecom Italia. The 
boards of directors of the five companies that are involved in 
the merger approved the balance sheets at the end of March, and 
the unification of the installations should be concluded on 30 
September. It is an epoch-making event, and an indispensable 
requisite for presenting oneself with the right cards at 
Community meetings focusing on the complete liberalization of 
the telephone services market. 
  MEDIA DUEMILA dedicated an entire edition (Issue 114, 
published December 1993-January 1994) to a description of the 
history, technology, and policy of the reorganization. This 
complete documentation also made those outside the 
telecommunications world understand that Italy is staking a 
large part of its industrial future at this table. 
  In an atmosphere that is characterized by continual sudden 
dramatic events, hasty marriages, and equally hasty divorces, it 
is opportune to open a window on the youngest of the five 
Italian operators. We are talking about Iritel, a company that 
was set up on 1 January 1993 to inherit the functions of the 
ASST [State Telephone Services Agency]. 
  It was a weighty inheritance. The tangles of the 
unsuccessful reorganization were mixed up with questionable real 
estate policies that in some cases have come under the scrutiny 
of the "Kickback" judges. An excessive number of personnel 
(almost 13,000 employees), who had become unmotivated because of 
the prospect of a future that was rich in uncertainties, must be 
added to this. There were all the conditions for giving up, or 
for moving toward reorganization into the most ordinary 
administration. All this obviously reflected on the quality of 
the service and consequently on us, the citizens who are its 
clients. Let us not forget that the ASST network was (and is 
with Iritel) the backbone of long distance traffic. 
  However it was not like that. In 15 months there has been "a 
silent revolution" that has changed the appearance, habits, and 
rhythms of a company that was closer to collapse than to 
relaunching. 
  It is a story that deserves being told, in an Italy where 
the 
"little bosses" of the public sector seem to be the order of the 
day, and where only bankruptcy and crime make the news. It is a 
story about men, about a group of managers who are professionals 
and have known how to interpret the desire for change without 
fear. It is not flattery to say that when uncontested managers 
look out over the deck, the outraged public is also able to get 
away from the adverse daily routine. 
  This is how it has been for Iritel. To understand what has 
changed it is sufficient to spend a few hours wandering around 
the building in via Europa, in EUR [Rome], that houses the head 
office of the central administration. One breathes a different 
air, it is a place where bureaucracy has finished up in the 
attic. The therapy has certainly not been painless. The company 
has been drastically slimmed down. The number of employees has 
been reduced to a little over 8,000 and the final goal is 6,500. 
There was a close confrontation with the trade union, that was 
also favored by the seniority of the personnel in service. 
Training and requalification courses are being started to adapt 
to the requirements of computerization and new technologies. 
  Moments of friction have not been lacking, but the final 
results show that there was no other way to regain 
competitiveness. The gamble was to invest in the quality of the 
network and services, and at the same time align the tariffs 
with those existing in the European market. A course that has 
made Iritel the first case of "administrative privatization." 
  The inserts accompanying this article [not provided] 
describe 
the missions and goals of Iritel and constitute a plan leading 
to its merger into a single administration. 
  It is more interesting to analyze certain strategic choices 
that were made at the beginning of 1993, and that are becoming 
concrete realities today. 
<H5>  Winning New Markets </H5>
  Iritel's submarine cable network is the most extensive in 
the 
Mediterranean, and it is a real bridge between Africa and 
Europe, and between the countries of the East and the 
Mediterranean basin. Agreements are being worked out with 
various partners. One particular goal is to turn the 
international network into one of the most important windows 
through which the Russians and their economy can look out on the 
western world. This is a strategic goal, even if today 80 
percent of the traffic takes place between the countries of 
western Europe. 
  A series of initiatives in the field of submarine cables are 
to be remembered: The ITUR (Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia) cable, 
that is destined to connect Palermo to Moscow; the TLB 
(Italy-Albania-Macedonia-Bulgaria-Turkey), that will join 
Istanbul to Bari; the cable from Italy to Tunisia, and others. 
In less than two years the 3,000 kilometers of submarine cables 
(mainly analog) will be increased to over 7,000 kilometers of 
cables that are almost exclusively digital. 
  The network of submarine cables in Italy will be extended by 
a further 1,500 kilometers when the Civitavecchia-Olbia, 
Palermo-Cagliari, and Savona-Sassari lines are laid. 
<H5>  Investments </H5>
  A total investment of 3.4 trillion lire is planned for 
1993-1994. The primary goal is to continue with the 
modernization and technological innovation processes to digitize 
almost the entire network (90 percent by the end of the year). 
<H5>  Special Services and Networks </H5>
  International competition can only be faced by offering 
special networks. In 1994, the goal will be the diffusion of 
private international virtual networks. A service to the United 
Kingdom has been offered since last October, and one with France 
since December. Services with Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, 
Spain, and Germany will be started during the first six months 
of this year. 
  The "Global European Networking," which Iritel joined in 
September 1992, has made a flexible network connecting the 
principal European countries available to the Italian 
communications system. 
  At the same time, in agreement with the SIP [Italian 
State-Owned Telephone Company], a major effort is being made to 
diffuse the ISDN [integrated services digital network] network 
that is particularly useful for business users. This will 
enable Italy to align itself with the diffusion trend of the 
French, German, and British operators by 1996. 
<H5>  The START Project </H5>
  This is the feather in the cap of Iritel's investment plan. 
A total of 715 billion lire will be invested over 1993-1994 to 
extend the optical fiber network that is available to business 
users. A total of 6,299 kilometers of optical fiber cable will 
be laid for the ground network, to create about 206,000 
kilometers, and 400 systems of 565 Mbit/s [second] will be 
installed. 
  The submarine network (as we have already mentioned) will be 
further upgraded by a total increase of 1,337 kilometers of 
cable and 10,710 kilometers of optical fiber, with 18 line 
systems at 565 Mbit/s. 
<H5>  Tariffs </H5>
  There have been two tariff reductions in the past year (the 
first by 30 percent) and these have brought our tariffs into 
line with those in Europe. Looking ahead this will particularly 
favor the business user. 
<H5>  The Moral Issue </H5>
  The new administration, with its clear and transparent 
rules, 
has marked a turning point with respect to the management of the 
ASST that was violently shaken by the Kickback cyclone. As 
General Manager Tommasi stressed, they have turned a leaf "by 
revolutionizing the regulations and procedures on bidding for 
tenders in a European context, and by establishing a new 
procurement office management, whose task will be to work in a 
transparent way and to avoid overlapping and waste with the 
other operators." 
<H5>  A Model for the Future </H5>
  Business culture and competitiveness have been the two key 
words around which work has focused for only 15 months. These 
are two decisive words for the future of the sole operator, 
which Iritel certainly will not become a part of by entering 
through the back door, and will introduce concrete results and a 
group of managers who are able to meet the new challenges. 
  In an Italy that is suffering from patronage and 
back-handers, it is important to discover that there are humane 
professionals in critical fields if we want to remain among the 
leading group of industrialized countries and avoid sliding into 
the second division.

<F P=106> [Article by Markus Schnurpfeil: "Mobile Radio Operates on </F>
Equal Footing alongside Ground Networks"; "European Study 
Concerning Future of Mobile Communication"] 
  [Text] VDI NACHRICHTEN, Bonn 8 Apr 94--In its most 
recent study the Eutelis Consult consulting firm predicts that, 
as the turn of the millennium approaches, it will be possible to 
reach telephone subscribers at the same one number regardless of 
whether their receivers are part of a ground or mobile network. 
In this way will the various network systems be integrated, as 
the authors of this study, Ulrich Kranz and Dr Gurnad Sodhi, 
explain in an interview with VDI NACHRICHTEN. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Mr. Kranz and Mr. Sodhi, the 
mobile radio study which your consulting firm has made on behalf 
of the EU-Commission is concerned with scenarios of mobile 
communication in Europe by the year 2010. In your analysis, 
however, you surprisingly often refer to already now available 
technologies. How does this jibe? 
  Kranz: With adoption of the European GSM Standard, 
on which both German mobile radio networks D1 and D2 as well as 
the new E-network are based, there has been initiated an 
extremely dynamic development. This development has been sort of 
the starting shot for the future of mobile communication, in 
which GSM networks will certainly play a significant role. This 
is because these networks offer not only a large subscriber 
capacity. They also offer a whole lot of functional advantages 
such as, for example, International Roaming and thus 
communication across international borders. 
  Sodhi: A further example is DECT, an already now 
available technology which seems to have have a quite 
significant potential for future applications in mobile radio. 
Fist of all, this Standard is the basis for development of 
cordless telephones and cordless telecommunication facilities. 
At the same time, DECT is also an excellent accessing technology 
which facilitates, for instance, linking subscribers of local 
networks via radio to other telecommunication networks. In other 
words, with DECT in place, competition with the local network 
(Local Loop) could begin sooner or later. This example 
demonstrates clearly that in the foreseeable future the 
significance of mobile radio will fundamentally change. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What will this change lead to? 
  Sodhi: Today when we speak of mobile radio, we 
mean networks and attendant services which widely differ from 
those provided by ground networks. As a D-network customer, I 
can naturally reach a party connected to a conventional network. 
With a telephone installed at home and another one at the 
office, and also with a hook-up to a radio mobile system, I now 
have have three telephone numbers and the caller does not know 
at which one I can be reached at any given time. This will not 
be so in the future, because I will have just one personal 
telephone number... 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: ...at which you can be reached 
regardless where you are located. 
  Kranz: Precisely. The various network 
infrastructures will be integrated into a "Personal 
Communication System" (PCS). The connection will be made by an 
intelligent exchange apparatus which always knows the location 
of the party called and will steer incoming calls over the 
appropriate network to that party. As to the question about the 
changing significance of mobile radio networks, they will 
operate in a Personal Communication System on practically equal 
footing with ground networks. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Who will be the providers of such 
services? 
  Sodhi: In our opinion the service providers, being 
already active in mobile radio operation, will play an essential 
role in its expansion. They will put together packages of 
telecommunication services tailored to the needs of customers in 
diverse user categories. I repeat: the PCS will not be based on 
one technology alone but rather will be a hybrid system 
combining several technologies such as GSM 900, GSM 1800, DECT, 
and the ISDN [Integrated Services Digital Network] ground 
network. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And does this not also mean that 
different customers may be receiving different services? 
  Sodhi: Certainly. Whoever wants to be reached only 
at home or in a certain area thereof will receive a different 
package of services than someone who requires telecommunication 
services at the office and during international business trips. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: What functions are taken over by 
the queuing strategy with regard to setting up guideposts for 
the PCS scenario you are describing? 
  Kranz: Certainly that of a central station, 
because development of mass markets for Personal Communication 
services can succeed only when the constraints have been 
optimally defined. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: And this means, for instance,... 
  Kranz: ...that viable competitiveness must be made 
the overriding principle in the development of mobile radio and 
telecommunication on the whole. This is why, for instance, 
private network operators should be permitted to install their 
own lines linking them to radio base stations for use of 
exchange computers of mobile radio networks. 
  Sodhi: In order to assure an effective 
competitiveness, it is also necessary that the relation between 
network operator and service provider be already stipulated in 
the licensing of mobile radio networks. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Assuming that the queuing 
strategy constraints are correctly defined and the effects of 
fair competition become fully realized, how many European users 
will avail themselves of Personal Communication System services? 
  Kranz: We are starting on the premise that in such 
a case there will be up to 80 million European PCS users by the 
year 2010. Certainly, essentially instrumental in attracting 
such a large number of subscribers will be a network operators' 
and service providers' rate-setting strategy. In our opinion the 
PCS will grow on the mass market when the prices for manual 
mobile telephones and the monthly basic charges have fallen down 
to 100-150 German marks [DM] and below DM15 respectively. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When the PCS is now based on 
already available or soon to be introduced technologies, what 
comes next? 
  Sodhi: Over the long range we will experience 
developments in mobile radio comparable to those taking place in 
ground networks, namely, integration of all services in one 
universal network and flexible transmission over various 
different frequency channels of this network, as the user may 
require. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: Thus a sort of ATM [Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode] for mobile radio? 
  Sodhi: Yes, one could describe it as such. 
Preliminary work is underway at the European Standardization 
Institute (ETSI) on establishing a Standard for a Universal 
Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). Meanwhile groups of 
experts at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) are 
doing similar work directed toward a Future Public Land Mobile 
Telecommunication System (FPLMTS). These two developments have, 
in principle, the common goal: a high-performance mobile 
communication system with a very large subscriber capacity and 
which in the long run will integrate all other mobile radio 
services. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: When, in your opinion, will such 
a marvelous concept of mobile communication become reality? 
  Kranz: We are starting on the premise that a 
technology based on the UMTS Standard will be introduced at the 
turn of the millennium. Services with transmission speeds up to 
2 Mb/s should be realized during the initial phase. Still higher 
speeds will be attained later on. 
  VDI-NACHRICHTEN: A multimedia-capable mobile 
communications system is what this is, then. 
  Sodhi: The UMTS will integrate not only all 
services but also all forms of telecommunications. And this also 
includes, of course, image communication. 
  [Boxed material]: 
  Pillars of Mobile Communication 
  At the present time the status of mobile communications is 
determined by two standards: 1. Global System of Mobile 
Communication (GSM) Standard, which covers digital mobile radio 
in almost 60 countries including both German D1 and D2 networks; 
2. Digital European Cordless Telephone (DECT) Standard for 
cordless telephones in Europe. 
  Study for the Green Book 
  The study concerning the future of mobile communication was 
one of three mobile radio studies made by Eutelis Enterprise 
Consultants in Ratinger in preparation of the planned "Mobile 
Communication" Green Book for the European Union. In this Green 
Book, the draft of which is now being discussed in Brussels and 
the final version of which is to be ready this year, the 
EU-Commission will have laid down its concepts of mobile 
communication development in Europe and begun setting up the 
necessary guide posts for a queuing strategy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Science Research on the Verge of </F>
Collapse"] 
  [Text] One of the most important victims of transition is 
the scientific research funded from non-budgeted sources. This 
victimized research--mostly technological--is done in about 80 
percent of all the science institutes, which are supposed to 
survive by covering half of the expenses out of their own 
resources (contracts, microproduction, etc), while the other 
half from a special fund, representing 1 percent of the economic 
units' production. 
  In many cases, because of the financial blockage, these 
institutes are so poorly funded that they can no longer satisfy 
their obligations. In 1993, only 50 percent of the special fund 
could be collected. For instance, SIDEX Galati presently owes 
over 4 billion lei, which the company serenely admits it can't 
pay. The fines, recently doubled, no longer have any effect. As 
a consequence, the Ministry of Research and Technology 
administering the fund started 1994 with 80 billion lei of 
unpaid bills (arrears). In the attempt to liquidate them, during 
the first trimester of the current year, the ministry has been 
thus unable to provide practically any kind of financial support 
to research organizations in their charge. So the situation of 
the latter became dramatic. Many institutes had to resort to 
loans of ruinous interest in order to cover, more or less, the 
payment of salaries. A new wave of dismissals looms on the 
horizon, especially for the specialists. Some institutes might 
even have to go as far as to interrupt their activities 
altogether. The severe, long-term consequences of these 
developments can be easily comprehended. 
  During a recent meeting with the press, Dr. Eng. Dumitru 
Doru 
Palade, the minister of research and technology, has 
categorically denied rumors that this special fund intended for 
supporting scientific research will be terminated. According to 
him, new financing sources for this vitally important activity 
for the nation are assiduously being sought. This situation 
could be improved by terminating the financing of geological 
prospecting, which is supported by the same fund and is also in 
arrears.

  [Text] Frankfurt. With the help of a new process from the 
French company Agicom, tools made out of iron, cast iron and 
steel can now be cold polished. The technique is much more cost 
effective than the usual [method of] polishing at a temperature 
of 140ë. Furthermore, the manufacturer can dispense with the 
strongly alkaline solvent which was previously necessary and 
required special safety precautions. 
  The tool is immersed in a cold alkaline solution only for 
cleaning. The actual bath in the polishing fluid is amazingly 
brief: the process is completed in one to three minutes. 
Protective rust-resistant and water repellent films can be 
applied in additional steps. 
  The comparatively small investment costs for the 
installation 
of such equipment make polishing castings affordable for the 
first time to small and medium-sized companies, according to 
Agicom (13 rue Louis Gameray, F-06300 Nice). Smaller quantities 
can also be processed at reasonable cost, because the immersion 
bath always stands ready [for use] and requires less energy than 
the previous, hot techniques. 
  In addition, the method does not require elaborate safety 
measures: there is no fear of hot steam which could lead to 
undesirable side reactions. Finally, it is argued that polishing 
at room temperature also benefits the tools, which are easily 
deformed in heat.

<F P=106> [Article by Christian Amatore: "The Molecule Spy"] </F>
  [Text] Chemistry is full of excitement. There is frenzy, 
explosion, turmoil -- but also there are microscopic phenomena, 
to which Christian Amatore has devoted his time. This "research 
maniac," director of the Molecular Activation Processes 
Laboratory (CNRS) [National Scientific Research Center] at the 
Ecole Normale Superieure, has developed ultra-microelectrodes, a 
kind of "microscope to watch molecules reacting." This tool is 
revolutionary, both for guiding the synthesis of new materials 
and for observing the exchange of neurotransmitters in the 
brain, and has won its inventor the CNRS silver medal. 
  His work has opened up a new field of applications. Air 
Liquide and CGE [General Electricity Company] are both 
exploiting the process, the former to develop biomimetic systems 
for separating and concentrating oxygen in the air, the latter 
to design materials for optoelectronics. 
  Biologists in particular, notably American Mark Wightman 
(University of South Carolina), are interested in this 
"ultra-fine activity scanner" enabling the molecules of 
neurotransmitters emitted at synapse level to be counted, or the 
effect of drugs on a rat's brain to be measured. Investigations 
are only just starting.

  [Text] Frankfurt. Jessi offices in Munich report that a 
spray processor for use in semiconductor production has been 
developed within the framework of a Jessi project. This 
completely automatic unit, called the ACC4, has been designed 
for treating silicon wafers 150 mm in diameter. 
  Instead of treating the wafers in chemical baths, as has 
been 
done to date, a process that has become increasingly difficult 
because of the continual reduction in structural widths, the 
spray processor removes the chemicals from large containers, and 
then filters, mixes, and heats them before spraying the rotating 
wafers. In this way, the liquid is evenly distributed on the 
wafer surface, a higher operating temperature with a shorter 
treatment time is achieved, and the reproducibility of the 
production process is improved. 
  Currently, 150 to 300 wafers per hour can be treated in this 
way. Drying is performed by means of heated nitrogen, thereby 
making a closed "dry-in/dry-out" processing cycle possible. The 
four partners in the Jessi project--Blomme, Sapi Equipments, 
Leti, and Philips RTL--are now developing a similar system for 
wafers 200 mm in diameter. It is expected to be ready in the 
second half of 1995. 
  The present system uses less energy and is about 30 percent 
cheaper than other competitive systems. Planned improvements in 
the process are aimed at reducing the amounts of chemicals and 
deionized water even further.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Max Planck Researchers in Heidelberg </F>
Achieve Structural Widths of 80 Nanometers"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute 
(MPI) for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg are currently 
investigating a gas-field ion source (GFIS) that can generate 
particularly fine, highly intense ion beams. This device, called 
the GFIS cannon, now makes it theoretically possible to produce 
and investigate structures in the nanometer scale range, with an 
eye to applications in materials science, environmental control, 
and medical/biological research. 
  The ion beams are generated in a very high electrical field 
to an extremely fine peak. A special peak geometry (superpeak) 
makes the ion beam extremely narrow and the radiation about 
1,000 times "brighter" than is the case in normal field emission 
peaks. The life of the "superpeak" can now be extended to the 
point where even industrial utilization is feasible. 
  Professor Siegfried Kalbitzer, director of the Nuclear Solid 
State Physics and Materials Science Working Group at the Max 
Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, notes in the MPI journal 
SPIEGEL that this ion source has already been able to achieve an 
image point diameter of about 80 nanometers and that it seems 
possible eventually to reach a diameter of 10 nanometers. 
  "While classical semiconductor technology currently plans 
structural elements having the finest structures at 100 
nanometers, structures at 10 nanometers will open completely new 
avenues," Kalbitzer predicts. One first simple application of 
focussed ion beams, which has already been tested in Heidelberg, 
is the generation of optical patterns in semiconductors (silicon 
or silicon carbide). When a thin, transparent layer of such 
crystals is irradiated with a sufficiently high dose of heavy 
ions, the ions destroy the crystals in the irradiated areas. the 
material in those areas becomes formless (amorphous). 
  Amorphous silicon has optical properties that are different 
from crystalline. When the light wavelengths are right, a clear 
"bright-dark" contrast, suitable for storing the patterns, is 
observed. Crystals only reform in an amorphous spot at 
temperatures of 600ëC. When the ambient temperatures are in 
the normal range, information can be stored for a long time. 
  Kalbitzer calculates that a beam diameter of 100 nanometers 
will permit up to 10 billion bits to be written in one square 
centimeter of storage area. This is about a hundred times 
greater capacity than the current storage densities. A 100 
cm[.sup]2[/]-area disk is therefore able to record a billion 
data points or a text volume of 100 million DIN-A4 pages. Should 
it ever become possible to approach the structural realm of 10 
nanometers, even far greater storage densities would of course 
be possible. 
  Ion beam technology can also find applications in 
micromechanics and microchemistry. The Heidelberg researchers 
have shown that a neon ion beam can be used to etch fine 
patterns in thin copper wires, for example. Because secondary 
electrons, which can be captured on a screen, are released in 
this process, it therefore becomes possible to observe and even 
control the progress of microtechnical processing. 
  Moreover, this kind of system permits highly precise cutting 
procedures to be performed, as, for example, preparative cuts on 
organic molecular compounds, microorganisms, and all sorts of 
specimens. In Kalbitzer's opinion, the exposure of photoresists 
with ion beams would be a very interesting experiment, in that 
the desired patterns could be written in substantially shorter 
times through the use of ion beam lithography. This becomes even 
more advantageous, the larger the wafer surfaces to be described 
and the higher the structural densities become.

General Mechanical Engineering"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Germany's MAN Technologie AG considers it 
high time that the mechanical engineering field, as a whole, 
avails itself of the numerous applications of newly developed 
fiber-reinforced heavy-duty ceramics. These materials are 
currently being tested for use as pump and bearing parts, which, 
for example, could be used in the aviation and space industry. 
  MAN Technologie AG, in cooperation with the Federal Ministry 
of Research, has been involved in the applications-oriented 
development of fiber-reinforced heavy-duty ceramics for some 
time now. On the basis of a known, but radically modified 
process, MAN Technologie has been producing semifinished 
products in the form of plates, pipes, and profiles. The 
automatic process-control system in its pilot plant has made it 
possible to reduce the so-called matrix infiltration time of the 
semifinished products by several hours. Using this system, a 
component having a wall thickness of 10 mm now requires only 80 
hours of matrix infiltration time. Other processes would require 
four times this amount of time. 
  In technical ceramics the ceramic matrix is reinforced by 
means of implanted ceramic fibers. Fracture toughness and 
breaking strain are thereby substantially increased. The 
material is made error- and damage-tolerant, and consequently 
more reliable. In addition, the thermo-shock resistance of the 
material reaches a level inaccessible to monolithic ceramics. 
Various research institutes have been studying such composite 
materials, also called ceramic matrix composites, for a long 
time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Aerospatiale: Qualification for a </F>
Cryotechnical Tank for the Ariane 5"] 
  [Text] GIE Cryospace (a joint venture made up of Air 
Liquide and Aerospatiale) has recently obtained qualification 
for a large tank for the main cryotechnical (EPC) stage of the 
Ariane 5. This structure is made up of two compartments, one 
for liquid oxygen (LOx) and the other, for liquid hydrogen 
(LH2). Qualification was obtained by executing a burst type 
rupture test. Rated flight pressure for the tank are 4.8 bars 
for the LOx compartment and 2.4 bars for the LH2 compartment. 
For the test, internal loads were simulated by pressurized 
nitrogen and local external stress by hydraulic actuators. 
Testing was done in a pit 30 meters deep and 9 meters in 
diameter, at the Cryospace premises at Les Mureaux during the 
night of 16 to 17 February. Pressures reached during rupture 
complied perfectly with anticipations. Nearly 700 measuring 
probes were placed on the structure, which, during the test, 
swells by several centimeters in height and several tens of 
centimeters in breadth. The rupture test was done using a tank 
identical to the flight model, except for the hydrogen 
compartment, which was shortened. Results will enable 
specialist from Cryospace and Aerospatiale, industrial architect 
and stage builder of the Ariane 5 to validate structural skin 
covering dimensions to determine safety margins adapted to 
flight pressures and fine tune computational modules for future 
tanks.

  [Text] As commissioned by the European space organization 
ESA in Paris, European industry has developed high performance 
solar cells which are particularly suitable for use in missions 
far from the sun where the technology of [providing] energy is 
difficult. ESA reports that under the conditions which dominate 
in distant space, the solar cells reach an efficiency factor of 
25 percent. This is the highest efficiency factor yet attained 
with silicium cells without the use of optical concentrators. 
  According to reports, the silicium cells are 6 x 4 
centimeters in size. ESA had already made the first breakthrough 
about a year ago, an efficiency factor of 23 percent, which was, 
however, achieved using 2 x 4 centimeter gallium-arsenide cells. 
The new record performance with silicium is credited to a team 
of companies under the direction of DASA [German Aerospace] 
(Heilbronn), to which the Milan company Cise also belongs, which 
was already responsible for the development of the 
gallium-arsenide cells. 
  The progress is particularly noteworthy, because European 
space flight cannot rely on the thermoelectric radioisotope 
generators (TRG) used elsewhere, which are employed to supply 
energy for missions into deeper space. In addition, the solar 
cells currently used in space flight are generally not designed 
for such low temperatures and such meager radiant [solar] 
intensity, [conditions] which must be taken into consideration 
at greater distances from the sun. 
  In orbits near the sun they have an efficiency factor of 10 
to 20 percent, but they lose their efficiency in distant space. 
For example, the radiant intensity of sunlight on Jupiter is 
only five percent of its intensity near the Earth. The 
equilibrium temperature of the solar cell designs falls to about 
minus 100ëC at these distances.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Francois Jacquier: "SNECMA: Three </F>
Challenges To Meet by 1997"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE 
introduction] 
  [Text] New markets, new alliances, and shortened 
production cycles. The French engine builder believes the only 
way to pull out of the recession is to break with the past... 
  "We're not going to see another `miracle' like the CFM-56. 
Our competitors will not allow it." Financial problems, battles 
for technology, collapsing markets: Yves Bonnet, general manager 
of SNECMA [National Company for Aircraft Engine Design and 
Construction], knows the company can count on very little 
outside support in its struggle for economic recovery. 
  In a sector likely to see increasing concentration, SNECMA 
has no choice. If it wants to defend its position, its markets, 
and its research, it must get back into the black as soon as 
possible. 
<H5>  New Markets </H5>
  Once a supplier of products for exclusively military use, 
SNECMA has succeeded over the last 5 years in becoming the third 
largest company in its field, thanks to a cooperative alliance 
forged 20 years ago with global leader General Electric [GE] 
(United States). The market-penetration achieved by the CFM-56 
family of jet engines under a 50-50 partnership with GE lifted 
it to the ranks of a world-class engine builder. With 6,500 
units in service for close to 200 clients, the CFM-56 is the 
world's best-selling jet engine. 
  Alas! It has had to pay a price for this success. When the 
full force of the recession in the air transport market hit, 
SNECMA was too much a one-product company. CFM-56 deliveries 
dropped from 900 in 1991 to 500 in 1993, resulting in a 
30-percent decline in sales volume. In the last 2 years, it has 
suffered annual losses of 600 to 700 million [French] francs 
[Fr]. The group suddenly realized it was overly dependent on GE. 
If business generated by the partnership with the Cincinnati 
engine builder were to decline further, 75 percent of its 
activity would be threatened. 
  Thus the company had to take action. Especially since its 
president, Gerard Renon, does not expect an overall recovery in 
the sector before 1997. "Even then," he says, "only companies 
that have developed new products will survive." So SNECMA 
decided to gamble: It would expand its product offerings in a 
bid to secure new market outlets. This meant branching out to 
the civilian sector, of course, but also broadening its military 
base. Formerly it supplied warplane engines only to Dassault, 
but now it is prepared to equip foreign aircraft too, though the 
latter are not really competitors to any great extent. It has 
recently proposed building a new version of the M-88, the 
Rafale's engine, to power the Swedes' Grippen. Discussions are 
also under way with South Korea on provision of a modified M-88 
to power a single-engine trainer. 
  In the civilian market, a number of needs have been 
identified. First, at the low end, for regional aircraft with 
fewer than 100 seats, demand for which is going to accelerate in 
Europe and Asia. Looking ahead to the year 2009, replacement of 
the oldest Airbuses (A300 and A310) should open up opportunities 
for engines with thrust in the range of 40-50,000 pounds. Over 
the longer term, finally, a successor to the CFM-56 will need to 
be developed. 
<H5>  New Alliances </H5>
  The problem is, with development costs for a new engine 
starting at a minimum of Fr1 billion, SNECMA may not be in a 
position to follow through. It now spends close to Fr4 billion 
per year--about 31 percent of total sales revenue--on research 
and industrial development. It is no longer able to sustain that 
spending level, which is substantially greater than the 
percentages spent by rivals (15 to 20 percent). Both its 
adversaries (Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney) and its principal 
partner (GE) are two to four times as big. 
  In order to compensate for this handicap, and despite the 
fact that "cooperation with GE remains indispensable," the 
French firm has entered into a number of alliances with new 
partners. With Rolls-Royce, SNECMA is working to acquire 
technology for the warplanes of the 21st century. Also in the 
military domain, it has just signed a preliminary agreement with 
Russia's Mikoyan for manufacture under license of the Larzac, an 
engine developed in association with Turbomeca. Another accord 
has just been concluded with Germany's MTU and Italy's Fiat Avio 
for research on an engine for the FLA, the future European 
tactical transport aircraft. 
  In the field of low-power civilian engines, those targeted 
at 
the regional aircraft market, SNECMA has signed letters of 
intent to cooperate not only with GE but also with MTU [Motor 
and Turbine Union, Inc.] and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The partnership 
would be based on development of a civilian spinoff of the M-88 
that may also be of interest to the Japanese for their YSX. 
Other discussions are under way with Russia's Perm for a 
40,000-pound [i.e., thrust] engine, a market niche where GE is 
not a player. 
<H5>  Production Cycles </H5>
  Obviously, such a policy would have no chance of succeeding 
unless SNECMA had some good technological arrows in its quiver. 
Even so, it will need to redouble its efforts to improve 
productivity. The objective is to reduce both costs (30 percent) 
and development time (1 year) for new engines. To meet new 
demands, the company's production facilities are going to have 
to match the faster pace set by airplane builders. For example, 
now that Boeing has decided to shorten production time for its 
airplanes from 18 to 14 months by 1996, SNECMA will have to 
deliver its engines in 4-1/2 instead of 6 months, if it wants to 
remain a player. 
  That means a complete overhaul of work procedures, including 
elimination of excess layers of hierarchy, autonomy for 
production units, creation of expertise hubs that bring together 
research laboratories, study bureaus, and the manufacturing 
side. A breakdown of old structures is under way. 
  "Aeronautics is no longer a separate industry," proclaims 
Jacques Bouhelier, the just-named director for comprehensive 
quality control. "In the future, engine-building will evolve 
more in the direction of client services," confirms Alain 
Habrard, director of development. Airlines will not want to have 
to worry about repair or maintenance of their engines. There 
will come a time when they want services at flight time. SNECMA 
has already begun offering this type of contract, and is 
considering a top-to-bottom overhaul of its commercial network. 
  If it perseveres to the end, the state-owned company's 
gamble 
will pay off. The most difficult part will be getting back into 
the profit column within the next 2 to 3 years. SNECMA may be in 
a position then to make a comeback and take in private-sector 
shareholders. Solid financial footing, broad international 
base--the vision is well fleshed-out. But just bringing in 
private investors will not substitute for the planned reforms, 
which are essential if the company is to prosper in a highly 
competitive market. 
  [box, p 24] 
<H5>  Subsidiaries Adapting </H5>
  In 1993, only two of SNECMA's five subsidiaries--SEP, which 
builds the Ariane's engines, and Techspace Aero, formerly FN 
[National Arms Factory] Engines, in Belgium--posted profits. 
Gerard Renon, the group's president, offers this analysis: "In 
an environment of such frenzied competition, we can no longer 
let them remain simple subcontractors for the parent company." 
Their survival depends on their ability to establish themselves 
as prime contractors on the international market. An objective 
which in most cases means more alliances. Thus Messier-Bugatti 
has decided to join forces with Britain's Dowty in the 
landing-gear domain. In the field of engine nacelles and thrust 
reversers, Hispano-Suiza is entering into collaboration with 
Grumman (United States). Sochata's maintenance activities may be 
reintegrated into SNECMA itself. [end box] 
  [box, p 25] 
<H5>  Technological Strike Force </H5>
  SNECMA's strength depends on the upstream organization of 
its research effort, which is based on a network of 80 research 
organs, laboratories, and universities both in France (ONERA 
[National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research], CNRS 
[National Scientific Research Center], CART, etc.) and overseas 
(Europe, the United States, Russia). Forced to compensate for 
its relatively small size, it gets as much mileage as possible 
from computer simulation, which saves time and avoids costly 
testing. Starting from scratch after the Liberation [i.e., near 
the end of World War II], SNECMA is one of the few engine 
builders in the world that has been able to design and build 
military aircraft engines without external assistance. The M-88, 
developed for Dassault's Rafale, is a distillation of expertise 
that will offer performance superior to that of any competitor. 
Compared with the J200 destined for the EFA [European Fighter 
Aircraft] and Pratt &amp; Whitney's ATF [advanced tactical 
fighter] 
engine in particular, it will offer higher turbine injection 
temperatures and an unprecedented thrust-to-mass ratio on the 
order of 10 daN/kg. That presupposes complete mastery of new 
materials technologies. Likewise, in the civilian domain, SNECMA 
has obtained remarkable blower efficiency and compression rates. 
These technological advances have not been purchased at a cost 
to reliability. For example, the failure-in-flight rate of the 
CFM-56-3 is almost 20 times less than that of rival 
Rolls-Royce's V 2500. With some 2,000 engineers on its rolls, 
"SNECMA is, from a technical standpoint, up there with the 
best--perhaps even better," boasts Jacques Caruel, the group's 
technical director. 
<H5>  SNECMA Engines </H5>

  -  CFM-56: The result of a 50-50 
partnership with GE, it has made SNECMA a leader in the civilian 
market, with 6,500 units in service. 
  -  M-88: Developed for 
Dassault's Rafale, it is a distillation of the most advanced 
technologies. It will be offered for export in various versions. 
  -  GE-90: With so much experience under its belt, SNECMA is now 
moving ahead on the GE-90, the world's largest aircraft engine. 
Its new objective: to be prime contractor for a major civilian 
program. [end box]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "`Future Large Aircraft Launch </F>
Possible Without British,' Says Gallois"] 
  [Text] Nice -- The launch of the European military 
transport aircraft, the FLA [Future Large Aircraft], is possible 
even if Britain does not order it and even if British industry 
does not play a part in its production, according to the view 
put forward on 7 May by Aerospatiale Group President Louis 
Gallois. 
  "We would like to have the British with us for industrial 
reasons -- the manufacture of the wings -- commercial reasons -- 
a potential British order for 60 aircraft -- and for the sake of 
the Airbus system's credibility," Gallois stated, "but we could 
still do it if they do not join us". 
  The FLA project -- for which pre-feasibility studies were 
begun at the end of 1993 by the four partner countries in the 
Airbus consortium (France, Germany, Britain, and Spain) as well 
as by Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium, which are all 
members of the Euroflag consortium -- recently received funding 
in France worth 2 billion French francs [Fr], allocated by the 
military planning legislation for 1995-2000. 
  This military transport aircraft, which should allow the 
Europeans to remain independent and not have to purchase 
American equipment -- the Hercules C-130J manufactured by 
Lockheed -- or Russian aircraft -- the Antonov-77 -- has a 
market estimated by Aerospatiale at 300 aircraft: 60 to 80 for 
France, 75 for Germany, 40 to 50 for Italy, 39 for Spain, 33 for 
Turkey, 10 for Portugal, between 13 and 18 for Belgium, and 
around 60 for Britain. The British must in fact choose, before 
the end of the year, the name of the aircraft due to replace 
half their fleet of aging C-130s. The members of Euroflag, 
including British Aerospace, naturally support the FLA against 
the C-130J proposed by Lockheed, which is available at an 
earlier date. 
  "If they buy 30 C-130Js in the first phase, the industrial 
effect of keeping a uniform fleet will be so great that they 
will be persuaded to take the EC-130 for the second phase, 
especially since they will have enabled Lockheed to restart its 
production lines," Gallois predicted. In addition, "if Britain 
does not come to us, it will not be possible to assign the work 
to British industry. Taxpayers in continental countries would 
never put up with the idea of financing work being carried out 
in Britain". 
  In response to accusations of excessively high prices, 
Gallois said that the manufacturers "were setting themselves the 
challenge" of offering 300 aircraft at the same price as the 
C-130J (an estimated Fr300 million).

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Paul Croize: "Forerunner to European Space </F>
Vehicles: A Model Capsule Built To Withstand Atmospheric Heat"] 
  [Text] Construction of the Community's Ariane 
super-launcher continues, as does the preparation of the first 
vehicles destined to service the international orbital station, 
R-Alpha, from the year 2001. 
  On its very first flight, scheduled for the Spring of 1996, 
the ESA's [European Space Agency's] future Ariane 5 rocket 
should be launching an automated space capsule foreshadowing 
those which Europe intends to use at the beginning of the next 
century to put its astronauts into space. Presented yesterday 
by representatives of Aerospatiale's "Space Defense" division, 
this project, called "ARD" [Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator], 
will be a very important technological step towards European 
manned flight autonomy. It will in fact make it possible to 
test the various types of material which could be used to make 
the future capsule's heat shield, as well as the guidance 
systems which will give considerably improved landing accuracy 
compared to earlier space vehicles of this type. 
<H5>  Distance From Ground is 1,200 Kilometers </H5>
  While Ariane 5 is slowly taking shape at Les Mureaux, near 
Paris, where Aerospatiale is starting to build the first flight 
model (the first one should take off in the Fall of 1995), the 
engineers feel that the future of this heavy launch vehicle must 
be prepared for right now, particularly with respect to the 
manned flights which its reliability rating, "boosted" to more 
than 99 percent (whereas current versions of the European 
launcher only achieve 95 percent), will render possible. 
  It is in order to prepare for a new activity, as far as 
Europe is concerned, that Aerospatiale has just launched the ARD 
project: costing in the order of 200 million French francs [Fr], 
it will consist of the production, in just over two years, of an 
Apollo-type space capsule weighing 2,800 kilograms. "It is our 
understanding of the technologies connected with ballistic 
reentry and our skills in the technical management of large 
space systems which will allow us to carry out this program in 
such a short time," explains Bernard Humbert, who is in charge 
of "manned flight" activities at Aerospatiale. 
  Of course, this ARD capsule will only be an unmanned 
prototype. However, its already respectable size will bring it 
very close to the future "CTV" [Crew Transport Vehicle] which 
the ESA is thinking of using from 2001 onwards to service the 
international "R-Alpha" orbiting station: with a diameter of 2.8 
meters and a height of 2.4 meters, the ARD will be roughly as 
big as the Soyuz reentry module. 
  Developed with the participation of the Franco-British 
company Matra Marconi Space with respect to the functional 
electronics, and of German and Italian manufacturers 
(essentially Dasa and Alenia), the ARD capsule will make a 
suborbital flight lasting around 90 minutes. Although 
relatively short, it will nonetheless allow Europe to test all 
of the phases of a genuine mission to service an orbiting 
station: after taking off from the Kourou space center in 
Guyana, carried high in the nose cone of Ariane 5 (above a 
telecommunications satellite which the rocket will put into 
geostationary orbit during the same flight), the capsule will be 
released into space over the southern tip of Africa, immediately 
after extinction of the engine of its launch vehicle's central 
stage. Propelled by the thrust effect from the latter, it will 
climb to about 1,200 kilometers from ground level, far higher 
than the 350 to 400 kilometers currently achieved by the Russian 
Soyuz capsules when servicing the Mir station. The ARD will 
then fall towards the Pacific Ocean, where it will splash down 
some distance from the Chilean coast. 
<H5>  Protective Shield </H5>
  For the engineers, the main lessons should be learned during 
the fifteen or so minutes when the capsule is reentering the 
atmosphere. The main aims of the flight will then be twofold, 
concerning on the one hand the way the capsule itself "holds 
up," and on the other hand the accuracy achieved in guiding it 
towards the scheduled splashdown point. 
  As far as its ruggedness is concerned, it is planned to 
carry 
out a detailed analysis of the aerothermal phenomena which occur 
during the crucial phase of reentry into the upper layers of the 
atmosphere, as well as of the effects of the notorious radio 
"blackout" to which the vehicle, which will have an aluminum 
structure, will be subject, and, of course, the effectiveness of 
the protective shield, which will be made of a 
silicone-impregnated silica fabric, while the capsule's rear 
cone will be made of cork powder and phenolic resin. 
  With respect to the guidance system, it will be necessary to 
evaluate the behavior of the reentry propulsion system (derived 
from Ariane 5's attitude control system) as well as the 
effectiveness of the descent system used: it will consist of 
three parachutes measuring 16 meters in diameter which should be 
steered so as to produce a landing accurate to around one 
kilometer. This would be a distinct improvement over what has 
been done to date: while the return of the Apollos which 
conquered the Moon was achieved within a radius in the order of 
20 kilometers, the Soyuz cannot be guided with greater accuracy 
than around 10 kilometers... 
  If the operation is fully successful, a big step will have 
been taken towards the setting up of a real manned space 
transport system. On the condition, however, that the member 
countries of the ESA will first agree to supply the Fr20 billion 
or so which its realization will require. This program will in 
fact have to be the subject of a meeting of the European 
government ministers responsible for matters involving space, 
which is planned for the end of next year.

<F P=106> [Article by Heidi Niemann: "Gigantic `Superbrain' Expected </F>
to Build Aircraft of Future"--first paragraph is FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU introduction] 
  [Text] Goettingen, 29 April--Germany's fastest 
mainframe computer has gone into operation. The computer can 
perform 12.8 billion calculations per second. 
  The German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) displayed 
Germany's fastest and most powerful mainframe computer in 
Goettingen on Friday. The head of the DLR Central Data 
Processing Division in Oberpfaffenhofen, Hans-Martin Wacker, put 
the NEC Corporation SX-3R supercomputer into operation following 
a test run lasting several months. The mainframe, which was 
installed in the DLR institute in Goettingen in September of 
last year, is one of the three fastest computers available in 
Europe. The "superbrain" can perform up to 12.8 billion 
calculations per second. Especially scientists who work in the 
fields of aerospace and traffic technology as well as climate 
research can carry out numerical simulations with the computer. 
  The "superbrain," which was installed on a 100-square-meter 
surface, consists of a puzzle-like set of metal boxes. The 
system includes, among other things, a main memory unit that has 
the enormous capacity of 1 gigabyte (a billion bytes) and 
numerous disk drives with a total capacity of 46 gigabytes. The 
most impressive thing about the mainframe is its speed. Access 
to the main memory unit takes 20 nanoseconds (20 times 10 to the 
power of -9 seconds). 
  The technical child prodigy is Japanese product. The DLR had 
also invited leading representatives of the NEC Corporation from 
Tokyo to the opening. As early as the beginning of September, 10 
of the manufacturer's engineers came to Goettingen from Japan to 
install the computer comprising three truck loads at the DLR 
research center. 
  Those scientists in particular who work on extremely 
calculation-intensive tasks can benefit from the new mainframe. 
Even the most difficult numerical problems can be solved with 
the "superbrain." Thus designers of aerodynamic equipment, for 
example, can simulate the flow response of aircraft or 
individual airfoils on the computer. Such enormous amounts of 
data can only be processed with this immensely rapid access to 
the main memory unit. But computer-controlled computational 
procedures are not only used in the calculations for and 
optimization of aerospace vehicles, but also in environment and 
climate research to, for example, obtain insights into the 
origins and dissemination of pollutants. 
  The enormous speed and capacity of the system are also 
apparent in the central unit, the so-called CPU (central 
processing unit). It has four so-called pipeline sets, each of 
which has four vector pipelines that operate at a total of 6.4 
gigaflops, that is, 6.4 billion floating point operations per 
second. Andreas Landhaeusser, who is in charge of the DLR 
computer, illustrated its scarcely imaginable speed with an 
example: "If the entire population of the world were to add two 
numbers on a pocket calculator, the SX-3 would still be faster 
than all the people on this earth together."

<F P=106> [Article: "Future of ESA With New Direction"--first </F>
paragraph is LUFT- UND RAUMFAHRT introduction] 
  [Text] The ESA's [European Space Agency] plans to 
participate in the international space station were called into 
question last year. It was not until January 1994 that they got 
around to restructuring the ESA space program. It was, to be 
sure, clearly reduced, but it at least affords industry new 
security in planning. 
  The decisions reached by the conference of ESA ministers in 
Granada at the end of 1992 concerning the major European space 
programs wound up in the wastepaper basket only a few months 
later. The mounting budget problems of the governments 
concerned, but also the first bilateral agreement between the 
United States and Russia on cooperation, had forced the ESA to 
basically restructure its plans. 
  After lengthy negotiations, in Paris on 15 February the ESA 
Council was able to reach agreement on new plans. On this basis, 
the MSTP (Manned Space Transportation Program) and Columbus 
programs can now be tackled as European contributions to the 
international space station. The program now includes a crew 
transfer vehicle (CTV), a manned, automated transfer vehicle 
(ATV), and an orbital Columbus element, all of which are to be 
launched with the new Ariane 5 carrier rocket. In addition, 
joint space flights with Russia (Euromir) and the United States 
are planned. How cooperation with the United States and Russia 
on the development, construction, and operation of a common 
international space station will look in detail cannot yet be 
foreseen. The ESA Council has only confirmed its determination 
to take part in negotiations with all the parties to the venture. 
  There were lengthy discussions as to whether the hitherto 
separate Columbus and MSTP programs should be combined. It has 
now been decided that a single management structure will be 
responsible for the execution of this program as of March 1994. 
For 1994 and 1995, 203 million RE (1 RE = 1 ECU) were released 
to finance the MSTP and 267 million RE for Columbus. But only 
studies and advance developments are to be implemented with 
these funds initially until the decision is made at a conference 
of ESA ministers in 1995 as to whether these elements will 
actually be built. 
  The extent of the financing for these is about 60-percent 
less than the amounts planned for them in Granada in 1992. This 
means about 120 million German marks [DM] for 1994 and about 
DM140 million for 1995 for the German contribution to manned 
space transport. By and large, the Ministry for Research and 
Technology's (BMFT) ESA budget was slightly reduced for the 
first time in 1994. The BMFT informed us that, after the high 
growth rates of the past few years, which had led to a doubling 
[of the ESA budget], the ESA contribution of more than DM1.092 
billion originally planned for 1994 could no longer be 
justified. Additional cuts are probably no longer planned, but 
upward adjustments are just as little expected. 
  At any rate, a certain security as concerns planning has set 
in with this restructuring. The ESA believes that the new 
program not only takes into account the financial obligations of 
the participating states, but also contains elements that are 
consistent among themselves and which can be adapted to altered 
basic conditions. The ESA thinks that these elements are unique 
in a framework of cooperation, will be utilizable very early on, 
and are compatible with a long-term view of the situation. 
  The now combined MSTP program for manned space transport 
makes it possible to transport persons to and from space 
stations, to keep them supplied and remove their waste products, 
for humans and robots to perform outboard repairs and 
maintenance on space vehicles and stations, as well as to later 
organize program elements in terms of long-term objectives like, 
for example, moon missions. 
  The CTV is a transport vehicle designed to be used as a 
return capsule which can be launched with Ariane 5. With a total 
mass of 18 tons, four passengers and 400 kg of payload can be 
transported into orbit and back in addition to a payload of 1 
ton from earth into space. The design permits a certain amount 
of aerodynamic maneuverability (lateral range), from 200 to 500 
km. It can be landed with parachute with a maximal degree of 
accuracy of 9 km. Water landings are also possible. According to 
ESA plans, a first demonstration flight (manned or unmanned) 
could be made by 2001, a second (manned) flight by 2002, and 
regular operation after that. At any rate, some technologies 
that have already been developed for the Hermes program would be 
usable for the CTV. Among these are problems involving 
aerothermodynamics, flight path calculations, thermal balance, 
materials, onboard systems, and testing procedures. But 
navigation problems must be studied again since the CTV is 
supposed to fly automatically; that is, none of the passengers 
need be trained as pilots. 
  The ATV is also supposed to be launched with Ariane 5 and to 
convey space station elements, or payload modules with a mass of 
up to 14 tons, to space stations in a lower orbit as well as 
serving to remove waste from space stations. The ATV will carry 
out an automatic rendezvous and docking maneuver and can remain 
docked at the space station for up to six months. Since the ATV 
will serve to remove spent fuel waste from space stations and 
burn out during reentry, the possibility of landing it has not 
been allowed for. The first flight could be made in 1999 with 
regular operation as of the year 2000. 
  Along with both of these vehicles, the CTV and the ATV, a 
European robot arm is expected to be developed within the 
framework of the MSTP. It should be ready for use as of 1999 as 
well as a space suit for outboard use, as already provided for 
in the earlier plans. A demonstration flight is planned for 1998. 
  The BMFT believes that a new basis for manned space flight 
could be created in Europe with these elements. From today's 
standpoint, these in their time "overly ambitious programs" are 
now grounded on a viable financial basis, technological 
continuity is ensured, and the opportunity to participate in 
global cooperation is preserved. The BMFT says that Europe has 
now attained freedom of design in view of our point in time and 
organization of its contribution to the space station. 
  But it is also important for us now to achieve closer 
European solidarity. The earlier ESA Hermes and Columbus 
programs were marked by a clash of interests between France and 
Germany. Now the European contribution to the global space 
station will be "decisively stabilized" by the merger of 
transport and station programs. 
  Above all, this merger did not go undisputed during the 
final 
phase of the negotiations. But, alongside the decisions on 
manned spaceflight, the ESA Council made a few more important 
decisions that contribute to the safeguarding of industrial 
capacities. Thus for the user programs such as, for example, for 
earth observation, telecommunications, and MIR [Russian Space 
Station] missions, we Germans are to contribute about DM1.3 
billion, about DM1 billion of which will be available by the 
year 2000. The ESA Council has confirmed that the earth 
observation programs, Envisat and Polar Platform, will also be 
combined into a single management structure.

<F P=106> [Article by HS: "Ariane 5 Has Great Potential; Five Leading </F>
European Engine Makers Plan Development Beyond 2015"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Thursday, 12 May--The European space industry 
is not allowing itself to be disheartened by the current budget 
cuts. The leading European rocket engine manufacturers--German 
Aerospace (DASA), Fiat Avio, SEP (European Propellant Company), 
Techspace Aero, and Volvo Aircraft Engines, Inc.--have signed an 
agreement that is expected to ensure the development of 
high-performance engine systems beyond the year 2015. The 
regular workforce of experienced workers is expected to continue 
to be motivated and their valuable know-how to be safeguarded. 
  Before the German-French Society for Science and Technology 
in Bonn, Roger Vignelles, the chief executive officer of SEP, 
and Werner Inden, a member of the board of DASA/Erno Space 
Technology, Ltd., in Bremen, seemed to be optimistic that 
Europe's space industry could hold its own against the 
competition from the United States, Russia, China, and Japan in 
future as well. 
  Rocket engines are a specific branch of the high-tech 
industry. This is why the experiences amassed and top 
performance obtained in this field over the past 20 years could 
not have been preserved and developed with activities in other 
fields. Moreover, while it takes a very long time to develop 
rockets and their core, the propulsion system, they also have a 
very long operational life. This is why we had to set our course 
for need-oriented developments early on. 
  In the opinion of the five rocket engine manufacturers, we 
can count on the following developments in the 
economic-technical domain over the next 10 years: an increase in 
rocket payloads for the purpose of transporting heavy 
geostationary telecommunications satellites, intensification of 
earth observation, more science satellites, the development of 
satellites weighing from 0.5 to 1 ton for low orbits, a demand 
for military reconnaissance satellites in Europe too, and a 
European contribution to the development of a manned space 
station. In the additional 10 years until 2015 we may count on 
Europe's participation in the operation of a space station and, 
furthermore, on manned space transportation as well as round 
trips to the moon. 
  In the field of telecommunications the number of satellite 
positionings will, to be sure, stagnate, but the payload of a 
carrier will increase every seven years by from 800 to 1,000 kg 
and this will happen despite the huge increase in carrier 
capacities as a result of further miniaturization. 
  After 2015 we can count on drastic cost reductions in space 
transport with completely new fields of application to solve 
mankind's global problems. The catchphrases with regard to this 
are, among others: solar energy from space and (wireless) 
transmission of same to the earth, the alleviation or solution 
of the ozone problem, and the transporting of the rare gas, 
helium, from the moon to the earth. A solar station in outer 
space with an output of 10 gigawatts (as muchas eight 
Biblis-type nuclear power plants produce) will also presuppose 
an entirely new infrastructure on the earth. Furthermore, 
reusable rocket engines will have to be developed. But first the 
development of large (lightweight) structures will also still 
have to be mastered. The development of closed life (survival) 
systems for longer space missions will be an enormous task. 
  In the opinion of the rocket engine makers, the Ariane 5, 
the 
basic development program for which will be completed in 1995, 
still absolutely has the potential for improvement as concerns 
cost reduction, only, however, to a maximum of about 10 percent. 
Greater savings beyond this can only be achieved through new, 
reusable equipment. Moreover, the U.S. shuttle is not de facto a 
really reusable piece of equipment. 
  At the present time the engine manufacturers are thinking of 
developing a small engine for a reusable "demonstrator" weighing 
from 10 to 15 tons in order to "familiarize themselves with the 
technological requirements." In connection with this, the 
Europeans are said to have negotiated with the Russians to let 
them have the appropriate (very advanced) know-how for the 
attractive price of 40 million German marks. 
  In the industry's opinion, the competition in the commercial 
space industry--especially for the positioning of 
telecommunications satellites--will be tougher in the near 
future than up to now between the European Ariane, the American 
Atlas 2AS, possibly a new U.S. development, and, furthermore, 
the Chinese "Long March," the Japanese H2, and the Russian 
Proton. However, the experts acknowledge that the design for the 
Ariane 5 presented in 1984 represents the best combination of 
performance, cost, and reliability.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Euroflag Consortium Focusses on </F>
Propellers"] 
  [Text] London. The European Consortium, "Future Large 
Aircraft" (FLA), has now decided on turboprop propulsion for its 
heavy military air transport project. British Aerospace Corp., 
the FLA program partner in London, explained that jet propulsion 
had been rejected because considerable technical difficulties 
were anticipated in having the jet engines attain the 
short-takeoff capability required on undeveloped terrain. 
  A further consideration in the decision is that turboprop 
aircraft are cheaper to develop and produce. Moreover, modern 
turboprop aircraft can now fly just about as fast as jet 
aircraft. On the basis of current calculations, the FLA aircraft 
is expected to fly at a maximum cruising speed of 72 percent of 
the speed of sound (Mach). The most advanced U.S. military 
transport aircraft, employing jet propulsion, fly at 77 percent 
the speed of sound. 
  Just a few months ago, it seemed certain that the FLA 
aircraft would be driven by jet engines. Several European 
companies had already proposed their engines for the planned 
aircraft, and for some time it seemed as though the future 
belonged to strictly jet propulsion. 
  In the second half of the 1980s, the U.S. aviation industry 
dropped plans for the construction of a turboprop commercial 
aircraft when the airlines decided against it on the grounds 
that the flying public were too accustomed to jet aircraft. Even 
the significantly lower specific fuel consumption of advanced 
turboprop engines could not alter the decision. 
  Two European consortia are already interested in building 
the 
turboprop engines for the FLA aircraft. One is the 
German-British BMW-Rolls Royce grouping, and the other is the 
Snecma (France), Fiat (Italy), and MTU (Germany) group. 
  Ratier-Figeac and Hispano Suiza of France and Dowty of Great 
Britain are interested in developing and producing the 
propellers. The main competitors of the planned FLA 
aircraft--the new An-70 from Ukraine and the Lockheed C130J from 
the United States--are likewise driven by turboprop engines.

Waits for U.S. Decision on Space Station"] 
  [Text] Berlin. A number of well-known companies will be 
absent this year from the forthcoming ILA '94 International 
Aviation and Space Show, which will be held at the Schoenefeld 
Airfield in Berlin from 28 May through 5 June. After the 
withdrawal of German Aerospace, it will indeed be a small show. 
Other German and international exhibitors either do not want to 
enter the show or have now withdrawn. Only the space industry 
will be present in Berlin in the measure it had originally 
planned. For that reason, the space exhibits will have the most 
appeal for the 250,000 exhibit visitors expected. 
  The main attraction for ILA guests interested in satellites 
and rocket projects will certainly be Hall C, where the European 
Space Agency (ESA) and the German Space Agency (DARA) will 
exhibit their most important and successful applications--and 
research satellites as well as the most successful booster 
rockets in the world--the Arianes. 
  The fascination of space is brought closer to the visitors 
in 
an extravagant "holorama" show. Through the new technique of 
"virtual reality" simulations, the visitors will be able to 
experience a space trip to Mars and Jupiter. Talks, conferences, 
and discussions by and with space experts will be held daily in 
the forum of Hall C. 
  The decision as to whether Ulf Merbold or the Spaniard Pedro 
Duque is to be orbited by a Soyuz rocket and spend 30 days in 
the Mir space station this fall will also be announced in 
Berlin. Jean-Marie Luton, director general of ESA, will make the 
announcement on 30 May. 
  This year's manned space mission and a second ESA/Russian 
flight scheduled for 1995, for which Thomas Reiter and a second 
German astronaut are already in training and which is planned to 
last 130 days, are preparatory for the large international space 
station that is to be put into Earth orbit early in the 21st 
century by the Americans, Russians, Europeans, Japanese, and 
Canadians. 
  Unfortunately, that ambitious project, which will cost many 
billions of dollars, is not yet certain. The Congress of the 
United States is to vote on it in June, and the "Freedom" or 
"Alpha" station may or may not become a reality. The 
justification for this project has shifted from the purely 
technical/scientific gains to be had to the political benefits 
this major multinational project would have for future relations 
between peoples and states. 
  The decision of the Americans vis a vis the space station is 
awaited with considerable anxiety in Europe because decisions 
related to it have had to be altered and postponed many times 
already. It is still expected that ESA, under the overall 
control of Germany, will develop a laboratory module for 
weightlessness studies; the module will be docked permanently 
with the space station. 
  Should the United States actually withdraw from the project, 
Europe could perhaps link the station module up to the Russian 
Mir-2 complex, which is scheduled to be put in Earth orbit in 
the late 1990s. In general, however, all European decisions as 
to their manned space projects are currently on hold, and will 
remain so until a final decision is taken on the large space 
station. 
  Probably the research ministers of the participating ESA 
states will not meet in Paris until late 1995 to discuss their 
further actions. The same situation also holds with respect to 
the decision on a European astronaut transport vehicle, by means 
of which technicians and researchers will be able to fly from 
Earth to and from space stations. After finally dropping the 
Hermes vehicle, which had become too heavy and too expensive, 
plans are now being developed for a less expensive, conventional 
astronaut capsule capable of transporting the four crew members 
and a ton of cargo to and from orbit. 
  Exhibited at ILA '94 will be the first designs and models of 
this capsule, which will be launched by the new European 
Ariane-5 rocket, which is near readiness. Certainly, Germany's 
commitment to manned space projects will be an issue in the many 
conferences and presentations. After numerous controversies, the 
public debate about that issue has notably subsided for the time 
being, at least until final decisions and money appropriations 
for the Columbus and astronaut capsule have to be made. 
  Studies now underway concerning these manned space projects 
are--for the time being at least--being supported by Germany in 
the ESA budget to the tune of 100 million German marks [DM] per 
year. That amount represents only about 6 percent of the total 
space budget contained in the overall budget of the Federal 
Ministry of Research. 
  Meanwhile, countless managers, politicians, scientists, and 
technicians involved in the space industry in both West and East 
Europe are taking advantage of the ILA in Berlin, especially for 
intensive talks about, for example, how cooperation with Russia 
might be strengthened. Precisely in this matter, our country can 
provide an enormous amount of technical potential and know-how 
in any future cooperative ventures. This new East-West mediator 
role played by the German aviation and space fair can--with 
time--become increasingly more important, thereby ensuring that 
ILA will continue functioning in that role in the coming years.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Photocells Show Record 25-Percent </F>
Output"] 
  [Text] European manufacturers have just developed silicon 
photocells with a record 25-percent output, destined to be used 
in future deep space missions but also in low earth orbit as 
well as for purely terrestrial applications, the ESA [European 
Space Agency] announced on April 29. 
  This output, obtained using silicon elements measuring six 
by 
four cm at low temperatures and under low-light conditions, is 
the "highest output ever obtained anywhere in the world using 
silicon batteries without using special optical concentration 
devices to increase the quantity of sunlight being converted 
into electricity." This technical breakthrough was made by an 
industrial team led by DASA [German Aerospace], with CISE 
[Center for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] (Milan, Italy) 
as subcontractor. 
  The photocells currently in use in all space activities 
provide an output of 10 to 20 percent in low-earth orbit and 
behave abnormally in deep space conditions. In general, they 
are not designed to function at temperatures as low as those 
encountered in that environment. 
  In these difficult conditions, space probes have to draw on 
energy sources other than their solar panels, whose electricity 
output becomes too weak. Hitherto, probes launched into deep 
space have used thermonuclear generators such as the RIG 
[Radio-Isotope Thermoelectric Generator]. However, RIG 
technology is not available in Europe; for this reason ESA has 
been working hard to produce an energy source based on very high 
output photocells. Just under a year ago, the agency had already 
achieved an output of 23 percent with gallium arsenide (GaAs) 
elements.

<F P=106> [Article by Patricia Winckelmann-Zilliacus: "Prototype for </F>
Finland's First Satellite Ready"] 
  [Text] The aerospace technology laboratory at the Technical 
University is well on its way toward constructing and building 
Finland's first satellite. It involves a microsatellite which, 
according to preliminary plans, will be launched in 1998 with 
the European launch rocket Ariane 4. 
  The microsatellite, which is called HUTSAT (Helsinki 
University of Technology Satellite), already exists in the form 
of a prototype which at the moment is on public display, hanging 
from the ceiling of the Heureka Science Center in Vanda. 
  "The prototype is the first phase of the project. Now we 
will 
conduct negotiations with our financial backers, the Technical 
University and Finland's Academy, regarding resources for phase 
number two. It involves 10 million markka and the resources will 
be used to build the final satellite construction, the fuselage, 
fuselage parts and the facilities, as well as to obtain space on 
board the A 4 launch rocket, says Dr. of Engineering Matti Brax, 
head of the project group. 
  HUTSAT is a microsatellite which weighs 50 kg. Its size is 
reminiscent of a traditional television set. The popularity of 
microsatellites around the world has increased in recent years, 
due to the development of microelectronics. Nowadays, 
complicated measuring instruments can be built so small that 
satellites weighing 1,000 kg are not needed for transporting 
them in space. 
<H5>  Space Research </H5>
  Satellites are generally used in order to measure and record 
phenomena in space, chart the surface of the earth or link 
telecommunications. The Finnish satellite is to carry out space 
research. The measuring instruments, which are built into the 
satellite, will measure the earth's magnetic field and radiation 
in space. 
  However, the most important objective for the satellite 
project is to train Finnish space engineers and develop research 
in the field. This type of know-how increases the ability of 
Finnish companies to compete for international space projects. 
In 1995 Finland will become a member of the European space 
organization ESA. 
  Matti Brax points out that Finland already has companies 
which are competitive regarding orders for various space 
projects. He mentions, among others, Vaisala, Outokumpu and 
Finnyards. 
  "What is technically demanding with space satellites is that 
all electronics built into the satellite must require extremely 
little energy. The satellite has a low electrical output, only 
30 watts, since the surface of the solar panel is very small. 
The satellite should also be very durable, since it cannot be 
repaired. We have estimated that it should last for two years," 
says Dr. of Engineering Juha-Pekka Luntama, one of the 
participants in the project group. 
  He says that the launch is also a critical phase for the 
satellites. One reason in that the parts are subjected to 
considerable shaking when the launch rocket takes off. Even the 
loud noise can cause satellite parts to come off. 
<H5>  Space on Ariane 4? </H5>
  "England is the country that has come farthest in 
microsatellite technology. Finland is approximately at the same 
level as Denmark and Israel. These countries are also planning 
to launch their first microsatellites," says Matti Brax. 
  A launch rocket can transport 4-6 microsatellites. The 
launch 
rocket Ariane 4, on which it is hoped that the Finnish satellite 
will be able to reserve space, will be launched in 1998 from the 
European space agency ESA's space center at Kourou, which is 
located in French Guyana in South America. When the launch 
rocket reaches the correct orbit, the microsatellites are 
released by means of explosive bolts. The orbit for the 
microsatellites launched at that time is a course that takes 
them over the North and South Poles.

<F P=106> [Article entitled: "PSA and Fiat to Jointly Produce a Direct </F>
Competitor to Renault's Espace"; first paragraph is LE MONDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Gerard Longuet, minister of industry, postal 
services and telecommunications, and foreign trade; Jacques 
Calvet, CEO of PSA Peugeot-Citroen; and Giorgio Garruzo, general 
director of Fiat Spa, were scheduled to inaugurate the new 
factory the Sochalian group built with Fiat on Monday, 16 May. 
The plant is located in the north, in Hordain-Lieu Saint-Amand 
near Valenciennes, where the two automakers will jointly 
manufacture a new minivan to compete directly with the current 
top seller in Europe, Renault's Espace. 
  It is not the first joint outing for PSA Peugeot-Citroen and 
Fiat, who have been collaborating for 15 years. Indeed, their 
first venture was in June of 1978, when the French and Italian 
automakers decided to produce a utility vehicle able to carry 
800 to 1,800 kilos of freight. They formed a joint company, 
Sevel Spa (European Light Vehicle Co.), which was held 25 
percent by Automobiles Peugeot, 25 percent by Automobiles 
Citroen, and 50 percent by Fiat Auto. Located in Italy, in Val 
di Sangro near Pescara, the factory produces Peugeot's current 
Boxers, Citroen's Jumpers, and Fiat's new Ducato, which is now 
being marketed. 
  Ten years later, in December of 1988, the two automakers 
decided to repeat their first adventure. They agreed to study 
the industrialization and production of a minivan to compete 
directly with Renault's Espace, which already dominates the 
highly lucrative market segment of minivans. At that point the 
partners decided to construct an entirely new factory, to be 
called "Sevelnord," in Hordain-Lieu Saint-Amand, between 
Valenciennes and Cambrai in the north. The two partners are 
splitting capital, expenses, and responsibility exactly as they 
did in Italy (25 percent Peugeot, 25 percent Citroen, and 50 
percent Fiat). Work began in 1990. It will end on Monday, 16 
June, when a plant costing 6.5 billion French francs [Fr] and 
expected to employ 3,500 people by late 1995 is inaugurated. 
<H5>  Four Brands, Four Names </H5>
  Indeed, Sevelnord's 230,000 square meters were designed to 
manufacture 120-130,000 vehicles a year at full capacity. The 
minivans will be sold under four different brands and names: 
Peugeot 806, Citroen Evasion, Fiat Ulysse, and Lancia Z (Zeta). 
The various models, which were presented at the last Geneva Show 
(see LE MONDE, 14 January), required an investment of Fr4 
billion, and are virtually identical, save a few details such as 
radiator grills and headlights. 
  Sevelnord is both an industrial and commercial gamble in a 
market whose growth has slowed. It is also a gamble for the 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais region, which is on its way to becoming a 
rust belt. The plant, whose promoters liked to refer to it as 
"the biggest industrial project underway in France" during its 
construction, is being introduced in an area devastated by 
unemployment (see LE MONDE, 29 November, 1992). Ten thousand 
people applied to work at the factory. 
  PSA Peugeot-Citroen, which voluntarily limited its use of 
robots, must have taken that social reality into consideration. 
Robots will handle only 50 percent of sheet metal operations, 
compared to 85 percent in other plants of the French group. PSA 
Peugeot-Citroen has also decided to organize production to make 
it cheaper, simpler, and better adapted to manual labor. A true 
sign of the times... 
  [[Boxed Material]: 
<H5>  The Minivan War to Heat Up </H5>
  It was 10 years ago, in 1984, that Renault and Matra sent a 
totally novel type of vehicle, a sort of minibus with the look 
of a high-class automobile, out onto French roads. Chrysler had 
floated the design a year earlier in North America. France's 
"Espace" and America's "Voyager" gave birth to the minivan 
concept. Espace's first victory was to win over companies and 
reconcile high-ranking executives to carpooling. Where 
motor-coaches--even small, metallically painted ones--inevitably 
evoked summer camp, buses full of sports fans, or cheap tours, 
where the CombiVolkswagen-style minibuses of the time suffered 
from identification with partying bands of hippies, the 
"minivan" seemed an essential accouterment to society's 
managers. It was modern, tasteful, and as comfortable as a 
high-speed-train car. Gradually the minivan also conquered the 
well-off professional class, hysterical, as summer approached, 
at the thought of journeying across France with a noisy load of 
offspring packed into the back of an overheated sedan. 
  As a result, the minivan--the only real automobile 
innovation 
in the last decade--has become a model every good automaker must 
offer. Top of the line (the base price is about 120,000 French 
francs [Fr]) and high margin, minivans are an essential niche in 
an economic climate that makes selling ordinary models tricky. 
Minivans account for about 1.2 percent of total automobile sales 
in Europe. The number sold doubled in three years from a 1989 
level of 60,000, then jumped to 150,000 in 1993. And even if 
growth does slow a bit, PSA says the European market should top 
the 400,000 mark by 1998. 
  France remains the market leader in Europe (28.5 percent of 
sales), followed by Germany (21 percent), and Great Britain (9.6 
percent). Renault is still top dog on the continent (44 percent 
of sales in 1992), ahead of Chrysler (17 percent). But 
competition is heating up: Mitsubishi has launched its Space 
Wagon, Nissan its Serena model, Pontiac (GM) its Transport, and 
Toyota its Previa. Starting next month, PSA and Citroen are 
going to add their own model offered under the four brand names 
Peugeot, Citroen, Fiat, and Lancia. Ford and Volkswagen will 
bring out their joint model, made in Portugal, next year.
