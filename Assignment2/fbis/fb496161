<F P=106> [Article by Lille correspondent Jean-Rene Lore: "PSA-Fiat's </F>
New Factory Will Employ 3,500 in 1995"; first paragraph is LE 
MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] PSA Peugeot-Citroen CEO Jacques Calvet 
emphasized the exemplary nature of the "first big auto plant 
built in France in 20 years" when he inaugurated the facility, 
dubbed Sevelnord, in Hordain, near Valenciennes in the north, on 
Monday, 16 May. The minister of industry, Gerard Longuet, and 
Giorgio Garruzo, general director of Fiat Spa, attended. The 
plant, said Calvet, is "a success that could serve as a model to 
all of France, particularly industrial France." In a region hard 
hit by unemployment, the new factory will employ 3,500 by the 
end of 1995. 
  Sevelnord, which is a joint PSA Peugeot-Citroen/Fiat 
venture, 
will make minivans competing directly with Renault's Espace and 
marketed under the names Peugeot 806, Citroen Evasion, Fiat 
Ulysse, and Lancia Zeta. The joint factory, the biggest auto 
plant built in France in 20 years, will employ 3,500 by the end 
of 1995 and will produce 130,000 vehicles annually (see LE 
MONDE, 17 May). The two partners split the cost of the Fr6 
billion investment, for which they received, stressed Calvet, 
only modest assistance (Fr250 million for regional development 
and a business tax exemption through 1998). 
  Picking up a thread started by Sevelnord director Roger 
Garnier, who described the "first big auto plant built in France 
for 20 years" as a move to defy the trend toward sending 
manufacturing work overseas, Calvet excoriated "the abominable 
Brussels Commission, which spurred European manufacturers to 
relocate offshore." He insisted during a press conference that 
"the individual expertise and combined technologies required, as 
well as the importance of auto manufacturing to our gross 
domestic products, make it an industry in which big 
industrialized countries must invest." 
<H5>  The Subsidiarity Principle </H5>
  PSA Peugeot-Citroen's CEO also reiterated his confidence in 
"occasional collaborative ventures" rather than "total mergers." 
In so doing, he offered his own version of the subsidiarity 
principle, whereby "[partners] do together what each cannot do 
alone, which," to the contrary, "means they do not do together 
what each one can do alone." To stay competitive in the 
promising minivan niche, Peugeot therefore opted to team up with 
Fiat on what is still a very cautious undertaking. "We were 
careful not to push up the cost of equipment," said Calvet, 
commenting on the "attempt to find a better balance between 
automation and manual work." Sevelnord did not opt either for 
full robotization or full automation, preferring to keep the 
flexibility offered by wage earners. "We are not exempt from the 
effects of a market turnaround," he explains. 
  Yet Sevelnord is clearly a modern factory. Though robots are 
in evidence only where they are more suitable than people 
(measurement checks, difficult or laborious tasks), the whole 
production line is computerized, making it possible to customize 
the handling of each vehicle. The goal is to manufacture on 
demand, to adhere more closely to customer needs. 
  Moreover, Longuet hailed the Sevelnord "smart plant" as a 
way 
of responding to the contradictory dual demands of "market 
segmentation and internationalization." The first calls for 
flexibility, while the second requires collaboration. 
  [Boxed Material]: 
<H5>  Record Hiring by Industry </H5>
  With 3,500 new jobs projected by the end of 1995 (current 
staffing is 2,000), PSA-Fiat's Sevelnord factory easily ranks 
first among investments that have created industrial jobs over 
the last five years. It is obviously the top investment in the 
auto industry, since it is the first new car plant since 
Citroen-Aulnay built one 20 years ago. More generally, however, 
none of the big factories built in any sector since 1990 has 
generated more than 1,000 jobs. 
  Whether you look at Aluminium Pechiney's electrolysis plant 
in Dunkerque (550 jobs) or Coca-Cola's factory in the same 
region (200), all fall under the 1,000 mark. Holland's Philips, 
which set up shop in Caen, created 300 jobs with its computer 
board factory, while the computer peripherals plant built by the 
U.S.'s StorageTek in Toulouse initially projected 400 jobs. 
  Hewlett-Packard subcontractor SCI set up a new site (900 
jobs) near Grenoble. Daewoo's plant in Lorraine was the top 
job-creator until now, with a thousand new positions.

  [Text] Ulm (Reuter)--The Daimler-Benz AG company has 
introduced a vehicle which they say is the first to run on a 
hydrogen fuel cell. Research head Hartmut Weule said in Ulm that 
the new motor could "become the greatest innovation for drive 
technology in the next century." The transport vehicle fueled by 
hydrogen is said to be a "true zero emission vehicle." He said 
that no exhaust gases were created in driving, nothing but 
water. However, Daimler-Benz does not think that it will be 
ready for production for 10 years. In this motor, electrical 
energy is produced in a chemical reaction between hydrogen and 
oxygen in so-called "cold combustion." But the size, weight and 
price of the drive unit are still making problems for Daimler 
project leader Werner Tillmetz. 
  In the experimental vehicle the 800-kg engine filled the 
entire load area. In addition, the technology is said to cost 
15,000 German marks per kilowatt of power. According to 
Tillmetz, the next version of the drive, planned for 1996, will 
only be an eighth as big and weigh 200 kg. 
  Daimler says that the development of the drive has cost them 
an amount in the hundreds of millions so far. The German fuel 
cell researchers are collaborating with the Canadian specialists 
from Ballard Power Systems in Vancouver in its development.

  [Text] Frankfurt. Starting in 1998 the Schweinfurt company 
Fichtel &amp; Sachs will produce the "Sachs Electric Superdrive" 
in 
bulk. This is a production-line hybrid vehicle which dispenses 
with the usual electric motors and their components, unlike 
vehicles with parallel drive train, because Sachs believes that 
they are too heavy and take up too much room. 
  In the "superdrive" the clutch, gears, camshaft, and 
differential are replaced by a generator, a tandem gear motor 
and its attendant power electronics. During a long-distance trip 
a normal combustion engine supplies the wheel drive with current 
via the generator and charges the battery. For exhaust-free city 
driving the system switches over to battery power, which can 
take the car about 50 kilometers. 
  Fichtel &amp; Sachs promises power figures suitable for 
automobile travel, high efficiency, low weight and a small 
construction volume. They say that a tandem motor combines two 
electric motors, of which each will drive a wheel on one axle. 
So far an Audi 100 2.3 E Quattro has served as a test 
automobile; it has a 100-kilowatt generator which provides a 
tandem motor with a current of 50 kilowatts on each axle. Now 
tandem motors with integrated drives are being developed in 
cooperation with the drive manufacturers Lohmann &amp; 
Stolterfoth, 
who also belong to the Mannesmann group. This should make the 
drive assembly for future hybrid vehicles even more compact.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenther Ludwik: "Autonomous Hybrids" </F>
  [Text] The hybrid drive combines the cleanliness of 
an electric motor and the mobility of a combustion engine. 
However, series production is sill far away. 
  The principle is easily understood: The conventional 
combustion engine is engaged for driving under conditions where 
it operates optimally in terms of fuel consumption and 
environmental protection, and at the same time will charge the 
battery. The electric motor is engaged when the combustion 
engine would run at a low efficiency and thus harmfully to the 
environment. This is the case when only little driving power is 
required as, for instance, in city traffic or in a stop-and-go 
situation particularly often encountered in the inner city, 
where emission of pollutants and noise needs to be avoided. 
  This idea is not new, but there are still stumbling blocks 
along the way to its practical realization. The optimum 
configuration is being sought. In order to approach this goal, 
the German Research Association has established a new special 
research program, "Autonomous Hybrid Drive Set," at the 
Technical University in Munich. 
  "By a simulation process we want to develop a model and with 
that configuration then build a prototype," explains Prof Dr 
Bernd-Robert Hoehn. "Conventional drive components must be 
optimized for this special application. Stepless transmissions 
and regulators must be designed from scratch and tested. These 
components will, however, be usable not only in a future hybrid 
vehicle but also in conventional ones and in electric ones as 
well." 
  The concept of an autonomous hybrid is explained by the 
basic 
diagram on page 20 [shown below]: The axle is driven by either 
the combustion engine or the electric machine operating as a 
motor, through a common stepless mechanical transmission 
featuring a wide range of speed ratios. When operating as a 
motor the electric machine draws energy from the battery, in 
turn charging the battery when it operates as a generator during 
light-load or slow-traffic conditions while the combustion 
engine is engaged. Boosting the battery charge is possible but 
not required during normal operation. An appropriately designed 
transmission makes it feasible to engage the combustion engine 
throughout its most fuel-favorable operating range and outside 
this range to use a high-speed and thus light-weight electric 
machine delivering full power over a wide speed range. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-EST-014-15A>      Figure </FIG>


  Further advantages are: 
  1. Use of smaller combustion engines is made feasible by 
higher start-up transmission ratios. 
  2. Use of smaller and lighter batteries is made feasible by 
autonomous recharging. 
  3. There is no need for a lighting generator and a starter. 
  4. The fuel saving in the ECE cycle is about 40 percent and 
emission of pollutants can be drastically minimized. 
  5. Noise emission is reduced owing to lower engine speed and 
wide overdrive range. 
  Among electric motors for hybrid vehicles, permanent-magnet 
(PM) motors have recently been found to offer great promise. The 
advantage of using them in vehicles lies in lossless maintenance 
of the magnetic flux. A breakthrough in required 
high-performance magnetic materials came about with the 
appearance of rare-earth magnets, Sm-Co in the nineteen 
seventies and Nd-Fe-B in the nineteen eighties. 
  "The previously high costs pose no problem today. Thus 
Nd-Fe-B magnets for mass products are now purchased at a price 
also acceptable for vehicles," believes Prof Sture Eriksson of 
the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) Automation and Drives [ASEA--Swedish 
General Electric Co]. "Drives with PM motors cost about 15 
percent more than comparable ones with induction motors. For 
that, however, in test runs they indicate an about 
15-percent-longer travel range. 
  Both the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) AG and the Bayerische 
Motorenwerke (BMW) AG got together with the U.S. engine 
manufacturer Unique Mobility for further development of this 
technology. Prototype engines were already tested in BMW's 
experimental vehicles. The engine shown on page 21 [not 
reproduced] is coupled through a speed reducer to a 
transmissionaxle unit. The tests verify that drive systems with 
PM synchronous motors, while certainly not the only candidates 
for electric vehicles, are probably the high-performance "number 
one" for this application. 
  Since several years ago the research departments of the 
large 
automobile manufacturers have already been been looking for the 
ideal configuration. Electric motors were coupled to gasoline 
and Diesel engines, even to gas turbines (Volvo ECC-ID 3/93, 
S.38/39). All designs to date have one thing in common: they are 
by far not ready for mass production. Thus even the second 
generation of the BMW E1 will not likely be produced in its 
present form, if at all. Also the Mitsubishi people have crammed 
so many innovations into its first hybrid research vehicle ESR 
(Ecological Science Research) that their study of it just shows 
what would be technically feasible if only the production cost 
could be to a reasonable level. The ESR concept is based on the 
series hybrid system, which means an exclusively electric drive. 
The four-cylinder tandem gasoline engine with 1.5-liter-capacity 
has a turbogenerator. Fuel is supposed to spare also the 
mufflerless exhaust system, electronically controlled 
counternoise compensating the exhaust noise. Body structure 
along with exterior and interior designs are setting standards. 
  Closer to practical implementation is the Ford design. Its 
drive consists of a 1,2-1 2-stroke 3-cylinder engine (60 kW = 82 
hp), an electric induction motor (40 kW = 54 hp), and a Ni-Cd 
battery (40 kW, 7 kWh) weighing 200 kg. When mounted in an 
Escort Turnier, the system accelerates from standstill to 100 
km/h within 10.9 s and in the electric drive mode to 50 km/h 
within 6.8 s. Driving at speeds up to 65 km/h is emission-free, 
the combustion engine automatically cutting in for higher 
speeds. Both sets together provide a power of 100 kW. 
  The questions remain as to whether there is at all a demand 
for such cars and how much they would cost. The results of a 
survey commissioned by Opel and covering 3000 car drivers 
indicate that 95 percent would buy a hybrid vehicle and 45 
percent would pay 20,000 German marks for it. A top speed of 100 
km/h satisfies 55 percent and a 200-km-long travel distance 
without recharging is adequate for 48 percent of them. These are 
interesting data to be included in the specification sheets for 
engineers.

<F P=106> [Article by LUK: "Service Provided By Robot"] </F>
  [Text] Industry expects the '94 Hannover Trade Fair 
20-27 April to send signals as to whether the hoped-for upward 
economic trend has finally arrived. Meanwhile the automation 
sector is looking for new markets. Example: At this largest in 
the world industrial fair the future market for service robots 
will attend the opening show. 
  All the 6,600 exhibitors and about 350,000 expected visitors 
see in Hannover a mirror image of the world market. The key 
items on display this year are about 250 exhibits of assembly 
and handling robots which include industrial ones, over 670 
material flow technology and logistics (CeMAT) exhibits, about 
100 compressed-air technology exhibits covering tools and plant 
equipment, and 420 surface treatment exhibits. In a special 
exhibit, first organized in Halle 17, are displayed service 
robots. 
  Modern assembly and handling technology boosts the 
competitiveness of the customer. Integration of sensors and 
electronics, as well as of image and data processing in the 
assembly and handling technology, can also reduce the cost of 
small-scale production. The slogan "lean production" means not 
simpler or proven techniques but more automation and more 
flexibility within less intricate and easily monitored units. 
  "In 1992 the German MHI industry reached 3.9 billion German 
marks [DM] in sales against DM4.1 billion in the previous year," 
calculates Dr.-Eng. Hans Muno, business manager of the MHI 
Specialty Group in Frankfurt am Main and member of the German 
Machine and Plant Equipment Manufacturers (VDMA) Association. 
"Neither domestic nor export business saw any incentives in 
1993, so that a further 5-7-percent decline in this market must 
be reckoned with." 
  Alongside assembly and handling robots, including industrial 
ones, there are shown building blocks and peripherals for 
complete MHI systems. According to VDMA estimates, this group 
made DM1.1 billion in sales. That corresponds to a 26-percent 
share of the total sales made by the robot industry. 
  Components and peripherals supplement assembly and handling 
facilities in formation of complete systems. Assembly and 
handling accounted each time for DM1.4 billion and thus 37 
percent of the total sales. "In 1993 there is seen a distinct 
shift in their share of total sales," estimates Doctor Muno. 
Further development of the sensor, control, and guidance 
technologies leads to an increasingly easier automation of 
intricate assembly processes. Assembly, components, and 
peripherals will assume a further increasing share, while 
handling has already been highly automated. 
  The share of about 200 mostly medium-size German MHI 
enterprises in exports is on the average 35 percent. The 
significance of European Union countries as their trade partners 
is clearly demonstrated by the example of service robots. Their 
export in 1992 amounted to DM181 million, 75 percent of it on 
the intracontinental market: Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy with 
18 percent being the three top ranking buyer countries followed 
by France with 15 percent. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-EST-014-17A>      Sales Made in West European Machine Manufacturing Sector} </FIG>


  Firms engaged in assembly and handling technologies depend 
on 
the economic position of their customers. This is how German 
machine manufacturing slided into the deepest recession in the 
last 40 years. The initially normal cyclic slowdown of the 
economy has been accelerated by the downhill trend which all 
other industrial nations including our trade partners are 
experiencing since 1992. 
  The decline in demand for machines in West Europe in 1993 
was, according to Dr. Muno's figures, about 8 percent. The 
decrease of production amounted to only 5 percent, however, 
inasmuch as exports to North and Latin America, Asia, and East 
Europe increased. 
  The industry hopes that the recession in Europe will slowly 
come to an end. In a few countries it has already bottomed out, 
some other ones report even increases of machine production. The 
German machine manufacturing industry counts on a slight, actual 
2-percent, increase of production. 
  This will be in a large measure attributable to the overseas 
export, however, inasmuch as the West European demand for 
machines is expected to dry up. The same is true of domestic 
demand, as far as this one does not depend on export. 
  "The cyclic swing of the economy could possibly be overcome 
by 1995-1996," predicts Dr. Muno. "Machine manufacturing should 
be among the winners, not least because many enterprises have 
utilized the recession period for restructurization. They will 
emerge from this process much strengthened." 
  It is all the more important, therefore, to acknowledge 
internationally visible promising market segments by responding 
to them at the right time. Appropriate stimuli will be offered 
at the 25th International Symposium on Industrial Robots to be 
held on 25-27 April next to the exhibition site. 
  A special exhibit, "Service Robots Have Arrived," indicates 
a 
certain trend into the future. Their future market potential, 
according to expert estimates, is greater than that of already 
widely accepted industrial robots. Available prototypes and 
first series-produced units will convey an idea about coming 
developments of their service capabilities. 
  One service of undeniably great value and with 
correspondingly great market potential is cleaning: buildings, 
airplanes, and machines. Special-purpose walking monitor robots 
are offered for inspection tasks or rounds in industrial 
facilities, in museums, and in warehouses, also in places not 
accessible to a person, such as the inside of pipes and 
channels. Particularly in Europe, in Japan, and in the U.S. 
people are less fastidious, even though robots for health care 
services still encounter doubts or even rejection there when the 
question of replacing the human touch comes up. Potential 
customers there have, however, no acceptance problems. This is 
symbolized by the "Helpmate" service robot already operating in 
U.S. hospitals.

<F P=106> [Article by Oskar Vincenz: "Efficient Simplicity"] </F>
  [Translation] A fundamentally new gas turbine concept 
makes it feasible to improve the fuel utilization by about ten 
percent. 
  New concept: Significantly higher efficiency. 
  "With this concept the ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB) AG [ASEA -- 
Swedish General Electric Co] becomes undoubtedly the global 
leader in gas turbine technology," hopes Dr Manfred Simon, 
member of the ABB board of directors in Mannheim: "The 
innovation can, without exaggeration, be described as a 
sensational one." 
  The new generation of gas turbines has remarkable 
characteristics: their thermal efficiency (ratio of engine 
output power to fuel input power) is almost 38 percent in the 
solo operation mode and the overall thermal efficiency of gas 
turbine + steam turbine set reaches 58 percent. When moreover 
heat is extracted for heating purposes, then the fuel 
utilization may be even 90-percent higher. With such a 
performance, then the two first engines of the new GT 26 series 
(for the 50 Hz market Europe and Asia) and GT 24 series (for 
American 60 Hz networks) are setting standards. 
  The new gas turbine concept has been developed by an 
international group of scientists and engineers from various ABB 
companies. Both new gas turbines, 240 kW and 165 kW 
respectively, convert energy with not only less fuel and at a 
lower but also with lower NO[.sub]x[/] emission (below 25 
ppm) and an excellent light-load performance. This technological 
leap was based on skillful selection of the process parameters 
for two-stage combustion. The result is a high specific power 
and a compact construction. 
  The key component of each gas turbine is the staged 
combustion chamber. The concept is both simple and efficient: 
such a combustion chamber utilizes the compressed air from the 
turbine not once but twice. Intermediate superheating is ensured 
by two premixer burners includes, one behind the other. 
  The annular first combustion chamber works with an unusually 
lean fuel-air mixture, the oxygen content being very high. About 
60 percent of the incoming fuel is burnt here. Prior to 
combustion the air is compressed to a 30:1 ratio in a compressor 
consisting of 22 optimally streamlined stages. In the burner, 
prior to ignition, the thus compressed air mixes with an exact 
fuel dose in an intense vortex stream. 
  The whirling of the fuel-air mixture through staggered 
conical burner half-shells is particularly intense. After 
ignition has taken place, the gaseous combustion products flow 
through a single-stage high-pressure turbine into the 
low-pressure combustion compartment. There, in the premixer 
burner, these still oxygen-rich gases mix thoroughly with the 
remaining 40 percent of the incoming fuel. 
  Owing to the simple construction of the annular combustion 
chamber, only a few of its parts are exposed to high 
temperatures. The uniform flame distribution prevents buildup of 
thermal stresses. A new heating power plant in Berlin-Center is 
to prove this.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenther Ludwik: "Mirror Reflection of </F>
Decadence"] 
  [Text] Communities and associations quarrel with 
electric power providers about the cost of solar and wind 
energy. Public promotion of alternate energy misses the mark. 
Other countries are farther ahead. 
  What the Aachen city parliament decided in a rare unanimity 
across party lines, the Nordrhine-Westphalen commerce minister, 
Guenther Einert, undid with a stroke of the pen. He refused to 
authorize rate hikes for electric power fed into the public 
utility network from privately owned wind turbines and solar 
power plants. The Aachener owners wanted to be paid 30 Pf/kWh 
for wind energy and even 200 Pf/kWh for solar energy. [Pf = 0.01 
DM] 
  Thirty-five cities and townships are now demanding larger 
compensation for regenerative use of energy. Expectations which 
such sort of environment-friendly proposals raise are in reality 
dashed all over the country. The energy provider 
Mueritz-Oderhaff (EMO) AG in Neubrandenburg blocked three 
ready-to-operate wind power plants for several months, reports 
Dr Gotthard Schulte-Tigges of Eurosolar's regional 
Berlin-Brandenburg group. Discussions about hook-up to the 
public utility network continued for eight months. 
  The electric power provider hit on an idea. In one location 
the Uckerwind Management Company has already let 700 m of 
underground cable be laid for a price of 70 DM/m. The last 100 
m, however, the EMO wanted to lay itself for any price, provided 
it were to receive an advance payment of exactly DM185,000. The 
local press scared the citizenry that, owing to availability of 
wind power, they will have to pay 7 Pf/kWh more. 
  The Uckerwind business manager, Joerg Kuntsch, believes he 
knows the reason for this controversy: the EMO must pay only 10 
Pf/kWh for coal energy coming from Lausitz, while Uckerwind asks 
for 16.6 Pf/kWh for energy fed into the utility network. 
  The Schoenau township with a population of 2500 in the 
Southern Black Forest will no longer put up with these stalling 
maneuvers. A citizens' initiative opposing the township council 
is to push through a resolution that the franchise contract with 
the KWR energy provider not be prematurely extended. This year 
the citizens have a chance to take over management of the public 
network and, as a model for the entire Federal Republic, 
supervise the ecologically sound conversion of the local 
electric power supply system. For this they will need about 
DM3.8 million, and the GLS bank is willing to raise the money 
from a nationwide partnership fund. 
  In regional squabbles about alternate energy it is the power 
giants who enjoy the strongest backing. On the federal level, 
meanwhile, the commerce minister, Guenter Rexrodt, has the legal 
authority over the Land (State) ministers of commerce. In a 
memorandum to all he has made it clear that he will not approve 
cost-covering rate hikes applied for by local communal electric 
energy providers. 
  Practical implementation of this model of energy supply from 
alternate sources will obviously require billing the consumer 
about 1 percent more for electricity. Against this the 
Association of German Electric Power Plants in Frankfurt am Main 
argues that such a compensatory rate hike is just "a further 
subsidy at the expense of business and residential electricity 
consumers." This sort of accounting gets no corroboration by 
Prof Helmut Tributsch, director of the Solar Power Engineering 
Department at the Hahn-Meiner Institute in Berlin. "Solar energy 
seems to be too expensive only because we burn fossil fuels 
without paying for the accumulating debt to the environment. 
Consequently, energy taxes should offset the apparent economic 
disadvantage of solar energy. The widespread short-sightedness 
and arrogance vis-a-vis solar energy is in my opinion a clear 
mirror reflection of the decadence of our technoeconomic 
civilization." 
  At the same time, for instance, Germany is not behind Japan 
and the U.S. when it comes to public financial support of solar 
energy development. However, while in Germany many expenditures 
and projects aim to mollify the open-minded and therefore 
confused public (the motto being: "something is being done, but 
unfortunately the technology is too costly"), other industrial 
countries are methodically planning for commercialization and 
cost reduction. Says Tributsch: "For corrective measures Germany 
would have to re-examine both the flow of research moneys and 
current subsidies to industry." 
  So as to hasten the utilization of solar energy, Eng Manfred 
Kern from Chemnitz proposes the following four-point program: 
  --enactment of laws ensuring preferential utilization of 
renewable energy sources; 
  --approval of state grants assisting enterprises engaged in 
further development of necessary systems, plants, and cells; 
  --active involvement of municipal offices in ensuring that 
the possibility of utilizing alternate energy be pursued in 
rehabilitation and renovation of single- and 
multiple-dwelling houses, residential and sport facilities; 
  --inclusion of a unitized solar heating plant in bids put in 
on the building market. 
  Right now the chances that these ideas will be implemented 
are just not very good. Industry is not investing, because it 
sees no market. And a market is not generated, because industry 
cannot deliver at acceptable prices. This vicious circle could 
cost Germany dearly, according to Joerg Schindler and Dr Werner 
Zittel of the Ludwig Boelkow System Engineering in Ottobrunn: 
"German industry will find itself in a tight spot, because Japan 
has been pursuing this matter quite aggressively."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cystic Fibrosis: Medicine Made by </F>
Plants"; "A Hope Born from the Alliance Between a 
Pharmaceuticals Plant and a Seed-Producing Facility"] 
  [Text] Aided by molecular biology's latest tools, the 
Jouveinal firm's researchers have succeeded in purifying human 
as well as other mammal genes specific to many gastric lipases 
(enzymes produced by the stomach and necessary for digesting 
fats). 
  One of these, isolated from a dog's stomach, is particularly 
effective for activating pancreatic secretions--which, when 
absent or insufficient, causes many human maladies, among them 
cystic fibrosis, a very frequent and severe hereditary 
affliction affecting in Europe one child in 2,500. 
  In order to produce this lipase industrially, in other words 
to "graft" this animal gene into the chromosomes of an organism 
capable to synthesize cheaply large amounts of the corresponding 
protein, the researchers could choose among a number of 
solutions. Among them, there is one using microorganisms and 
farmed "transgenic" animals (in whose genotype the alien gene is 
to be introduced), a solution applied by many industrial 
research laboratories for producing pharmaceutical substances) 
(LE MONDE 18 September 1991). 
  For technical and financial reasons equally, Jouveinal has 
finally opted for the vegetal. According to the company's 
director, Pierre Le Sourd, "When compared to animal 
biotechnologies, the production of therapeutic enzymes through 
plants offers better safety guaranties against viral 
contamination, while providing a very cost-effective, large 
scale production." Advantages even more valuable can be derived 
from transforming genetically tobacco or, even better, rapeseed 
plants into true "molecule factories," by a method developed 
recently at Limagrain, the world's third largest seed production 
facility, in a fashion common to many other international 
associations. 
  By deciding to join their know-how, the two enterprises have 
concluded a four-year agreement and set aside about 20 million 
French francs for the project. They hope to obtain a 
productivity of one kg purified lipase per hectare of rapeseed. 
Limagrain will be responsible for the plants' genetic 
manipulation, the cultivation of the fields, and for the first 
stages of extracting the lipase. Jouveinal will be charged with 
enzyme purification, studying its biological activity, and with 
monitoring the medicine's--hoped for--safety and performance 
against the digestive attacks (symptoms) of cystic fibrosis. 
  Relatively easy to manipulate genetically, the rapeseed is a 
storage organism with a natural metabolism totally geared for 
protein production. Its use, therefore, appears particularly 
well adapted for producing molecules of industrial or 
therapeutic interests. 
  Well versed in vegetal transformation technology, Limagrain 
has also concluded a cooperation agreement with the Regional 
Blood Transformation Center (CRTS), on 9 May in Lille, with the 
objective of producing, via plants, certain human proteins 
existing in the blood (albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsine, hemostatic 
factor).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bacteria Produce Interferon Gamma"; </F>
"Fraunhofer: The Yield Reaches One Gram Per Liter of Bacteria 
Culture"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. At the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology 
and Aerosol Research in Hannover there has been developed an 
interferon gamma which is said to be even more effective than 
its natural prototype. In the human body interferons are by T 
cells and activated wherever cells become diseased or are 
threatened by a virus. The interferons attach themselves to 
receptors at the appropriate locations on the top side of a cell 
and from there send their signals to its nucleus. This, reports 
the Fraunhofer Society in Munich, causes the cell to boost its 
defenses. 
  In their work the researchers, Dr Bernd Otto and his 
associates used what may be called a trick: the DNS chain 
containing the information necessary for protein buildup was 
shortened at the critical place so that the proteins lost a few 
amino acids. Upon being inoculated with a molecule of this 
modified genetic substance, bacteria produce highly effective 
interferon gamma. 
  It is further claimed that the bacteria strains produce each 
one gram of interferon per liter of bacteria culture. Because 
the bacteria do do not excrete the interferon during metabolism, 
they must be kept in a pressure container. The thus retained 
protein clusters must be decomposed, renatured, and purified. 
  The process of manufacturing the new active interferon gamma 
has, according to the reports, already passed the laboratory 
stage and been further developed. It is now to be marketed by 
the Rentschler GmbH [GmbH = Ltd] in Laupheim. The new interferon 
gamma is expected to be ready within a few years for clinical 
tests. 
  The tests will show whether and how this market will 
develop, 
hopes Friedrich E. Rentschler. It is expected that this 
interferon will be just as helpful in rheumatic and contagious 
diseases as against allergies and chronic diseases of the immune 
system. 
  The interferon thus produced by genetic engineering and the 
process by which it is extracted have already been patented in 
Germany, patents covering both European and American markets 
having been applied for, reports Dr Bernd Otto at the Fraunhofer 
Institute of Toxicology and Aerosol Research ITA (1 
Nikolai-Fuchs Str., 30625 Hannover; Tel 0511-5350-273, Fax 
0511-5350-155).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bonn: 100 Million DM for Gene </F>
Research"] 
  [Text] Bonn. Within the coming five years the Federal 
Ministry of Research will provide about DM100 million for 
speeding up utilization of the results of gene research. Paul 
Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, announces that the 
emphasis in the new research program, "Methods of Decoding and 
Utilizing Biological Building Charts," is on development of 
therapies against diseases. 
  This program is designed, above all, to stimulate the use of 
exceptionally- high-capacity computers and automated techniques 
in analytical procedures for decoding genes as carriers which 
carry heredity information and thus the important life's 
important building blocks. Genome research should help make it 
increasingly possible to put medicine, the pharmaceutic 
industry, and agriculture on a new scientific basis. An example 
of successful genetically engineered production of drugs is the 
"Factor 8" against hemophilia, which until now had to be 
isolated from human blood. 
  According to expert estimates, over 4000 diseases at least 
can be traced to defects in biological building charts. 
Ernst-Ludwig Winnaker, director of the Genetics Center in 
Munich, reports that German researchers had played a substantial 
role in identifying the genetic causes of various diseases such 
as muscular ones and chorea, also heart and blood circulation 
diseases, and intestinal cancer. 
  Krueger points out that the U.S., Japanese, British, and 
French industries are already heavily engaged in this 
prospective field. This, in the opinion of specialists, requires 
that the licensing procedure be shortened. Looking at the soon 
to be amended Genetic Engineering Law, Axel Kleemann of the 
Pharmaceutic Works in Dresden has pointed out that it is not 
sufficient to correct the law but also the new rules must be 
better implemented.

<F P=106> [Article signed Y.A.: "Parallel Technologies Support </F>
Expansion of Mainframe Servers"] 
  [Text] Thanks to its new Cisc [Complex Construction Set 
Computer] processors combined with a parallel multi-server 
architecture, Bull is slowly opening up its company mainframes. 
  "Parallel" technologies are in the process of redefining the 
concepts of large and medium-sized mainframe systems. IBM 
recently announced a renewal of its supply in mainframes built 
on its Cisc 390 processors thanks to solutions called "parallel 
transaction or interrogation servers." Mainframes are in the 
process of becoming secure information servers. It is now 
Bull's turn to unveil a new range of large and medium-sized 
company mainframes which mark a technological break with its 
previous range (DPS 7000/700 and 700/400), thanks notably to the 
achievement of Symmetrical Multiprocessing Technologies (SMP) 
but also thanks to the use of a "home" Cisc processor with a 
very high integration density. (The processor developed in Cmos 
[Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor]/VLSI [Very Large Scale 
Integration] technology by Bull integrates 4.7 million 
transistors. It runs at 66 MHz and offers 30 Mips [million 
instructions per second] power) 
<H5>  Up to 24 Parallel Processors </H5>
  These servers can integrate up to 24 processors in parallel 
(6 cards with 4 processors) and are defined according to a 
number of models in relation to the missions they are destined 
to carry out: mainframe on a transactional processing 
environment (up to 7,000 active users), network server (up to 
1,000 users), relational applications server, and client/server 
in a production environment and as a decision-making aid. On 
each of the cards interlinked by a bus with a debit of 500 Mo/s 
[Megabyte per second], processors communicate with each other 
with the help of an interconnection network with an output of 1 
Go/s [Gigabyte per second] and sharing a memory faceplate of 64 
Ko [Kilobytes] (Footnote 2) (The faceplate coherence is directly 
managed by the GC0S7 mainframe operation system in which a EXMS 
multiprocessor extension was jointly developed). The result is 
an increase in power of over 50 percent compared to the previous 
range and an improvement in the performance/price ratio which, 
according to Bull, is of a factor of three. These new 
capacities mean important gains in terms of transfer rates 
(local network at 100 Mbits/s instead of 10 Mbits/s) in 
particular under TCP/IP [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol] for client/server applications while discharging 
(thanks to the parallelism) the main servers from their 
communication tasks. The cost of the Mips on the network server 
is to the order of 20,000 French francs [Fr] while it used to be 
about Fr180,000 on the previous range and Fr60,000 on the most 
recent generations of parallel servers. The expansion to open 
systems (Unix) and to client/server applications, which requires 
a lot of communications to render the heterogeneous nature of 
the systems transparent to the user), are not only becoming 
possible but also accessible in terms of cost.

  [Text] Munich (Reuter). Three leading electronics 
companies--Siemens AG of Germany, Toshiba of Japan, and IBM of 
the United States--are notably expanding their cooperation in 
the development of computer storage chips. Siemens of Munich 
reports that the three companies want to begin immediately to 
develop the second generation 64-MB chips jointly. The three 
companies have been working together since 1992 on the current 
developmental step--the 256-MB chip. The same companies have 
been cooperating in other electronics fields for a long time. 
  The dynamic 64-MB read/write memory is to be developed in 
the 
IBM laboratories in East Fishkill, New York, and in Essex 
Junction, Vermont. The participating companies will share in the 
costs. A Siemens spokesman indicates that the costs will 
probably come to several hundred million German marks [DM]. The 
experience gained in the ongoing cooperative work on the 256-Mb 
chip will enrich the new cooperative venture. 
  Siemens reports further that a first working model of the 
new 
64-MB chip is to be ready as early as 1996. The chip can be 
expected to appear on the market in 1997. Its storage capacity 
will be able to hold the text content of more than 2,000 typed 
pages. Currently, the computer market is still dominated by the 
two-generations older 4-MB chip. 
  Siemens and Toshiba have been working together since their 
joint development of the 1-MB chip, standard cells, and the 
so-called "gate arrays." IBM is involved in a joint venture with 
Toshiba in Japan on the production of flat color screens. The 
same two companies are also cooperating in flash-storage 
technology. To date, cooperation between the three companies has 
been limited to the development of the 256-MB chip. 
  IBM and Siemens are also jointly developing the first 
generation 64-MB chip, the first working model of which was 
shown last autumn. The only cooperative production venture 
between IBM and Siemens is in the case of the 16-MB chip. 
According to Siemens, further cooperation in semiconductor 
production has only been discussed in general terms, with no 
specific projects named.

  [Text] Bonn, 8 June. Research support should be extended 
to the use of new ideas in pilot products. This was the view of 
Guenter Rexrodt, Federal Minister for Economics, and Hans 
Wohlfart, the president of the Working Association of Industrial 
Research Associations (AiF). Technology policy of the 
traditional pattern has often been inadequate, said Rexrodt. A 
comprehensive innovation policy must include the entire sequence 
of the innovation process from the discovery of the idea up to 
market readiness, he said. Speaking at the annual AiF meeting in 
Cologne, the FDP politician Rexrodt advocated a basically new 
approach in this direction in order to facilitate the conversion 
of research results into new products. 
  Wohlfart too said that the efforts of the state and industry 
must lead to usable innovations. He urged that pre-competitve 
organized industrial cooperative research should be supplemented 
by supporting applications research, related to products and 
processes, in small and medium companies. This support could 
start from the results of cooperative research and extend as far 
as pilot applications. Moreover, Wohlfart appealed to 
politicians to raise the support for cooperative research from 
the current 170 million German marks [DM] to the actual need of 
about DM250 million, and to eliminate the freeze on expenditures 
for 1994. Rexrodt said that the budget freeze would not burden 
cooperative research. 
  In view of the forty-year existence of the AiF, Rexrodt, 
Wohlfart, and Tyll Necker, the president of the Federal 
Association of German Industry (BDI), stressed how this 
instrument of industrial cooperative research has proven itself. 
In 1950, Ludwig Erhard, then the Minister for Economics, 
provided DMl million in his budget for the first time for 
"strengthening the capability of small and medium industry." In 
1954, 20 research association of various industrial branches 
joined to form the autonomous organization AiF. During the past 
four decades, more than 10,000 projects have been financed with 
more than two billion marks of public funds and at least twice 
as many from industry's own funds, Wohlfart said. The basic 
elements of cooperative research--cooperation of companies in 
research associations and availability of the results without 
charge--have proven themselves in the new laender as well, 
according to Wohlfart. In the new laender, 3000 medium and small 
enterprises and 34 research institutes have become members of 
AiF associations. Four new research associations from eastern 
Germany have broadened the spectrum of industrial branches. As 
a project manager, the AiF administers one-third of the federal 
government's subsidies for the new laender. The federal 
research aid for the new laender was well received by small 
firms in particular, according to AiF. Stabilization at a low 
level was unmistakable, said Wohlfart, who himself is the 
business manager of a textile company in Saxony. However, 
eastern German small business had too little capital to be able 
to do research themselves. For this reason, continuity of state 
research aid was all the more necessary, he said. 
  Rexrodt feels that a critical examination of AiF processes 
and instruments is necessary. He asked whether the right 
research projects are being supported and whether the 
distribution of means is still flexible enough to keep up with 
the rapid pace of worldwide innovation. Wohlfart also felt that 
it was important to simplify and streamline AiF administrative 
procedures. Important progress has already been made in this 
area, he said.

  [Text] There are numerous tar dumps in the new federal 
laender, the result of lignite coking residue dumping. A 
two-stage conditioning process developed by Wuppertal-based OeKa 
can be used to obtain a solid fuel from this matter, which is 
rich in phenol and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
  If a lime-based storage mineral (Novomix) in suspension form 
is stirred into the tar, it both reduces the odor given off and 
creates an initial liquid fuel that can easily be piped off. In 
the second stage, Novomix-F is added continuously as a 
compacting agent, within a short time turning the tar into a 
solid substance matching raw lignite in appearance and calorific 
value. This material can consequently be burned along with 
lignite. The storage minerals' basic components bind the acid 
components of the flue gas during combustion. 
  The process has been successfully tested in a pilot project 
supported by the Land of Brandenburg. The storage mineral, 
which OeKa Environmental Engineering developed together with 
various universities, can be used to immobilize pollutants found 
in gases, fluids, and solids.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Last year, the various manufacturers of application specific 
integrated circuits (ASICs) took turns announcing complementary 
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) gate arrays with 0.5m 
feature sizes that employ the latest in MOS technology. These 
gate arrays conformed to past technical trends, and compared to 
the previous generation of gate array series, featured overall 
enhanced performance, faster signal propagation delay times per 
standard gate of roughly 200-250ps, and packed between 
300,000-500,000 gates on a single chip. 
  While achieving this kind of high performance, these 
0.5m 
gate arrays also reduced their supply voltage from the standard 
5V to 3.3V, making them advantageous from the aspects of power 
consumption and operating noise. However, most applications of 
CMOS gate arrays are still 5V systems, and what is needed is 
technology that can be used in systems with dual 5V/3V power 
sources. And while the operating speeds of the logic gates in 
these gate arrays have been enhanced remarkably, inter-chip 
signal transmission speeds have not kept pace, and this 
unbalance has begun to make itself conspicuous. Premised on this 
unbalance, double clock technology is becoming prevalent in 
state-of-the-art microprocessors, and new technologies are in 
the process of being developed for gate arrays as well. 
  This report focuses primarily on the move toward 3.3V supply 
voltage that is accompanying the introduction of 0.5m CMOS 
gate arrays, and the high-speed inter-chip signal transmission 
technology for multiple chips that has recently begun to be 
supported by gate arrays. 
<H5>  Switch From 5V to 3.3V Power Sources </H5>
  The switch to 3.3V power sources for 0.5m CMOS gate 
arrays 
is highlighted by the fact that most of the leading-edge CISC 
and RISC processors announced between last year and this year 
were built for 3.3V power supplies. However, as will be 
understood from studying the CMOS gate array specifications 
listed in Table 1 and the trend toward higher speed illustrated 
in Figure 1, the main reason for the switch to 3.3V technology 
lies in the fact that, in order to maintain the trend toward 
faster operating speeds in 0.5m generation devices as well, 
these devices employ MOS transistors with high drive 
capabilities, with 0.5m gate lengths and extremely thin gate 
oxide films of plus or minus 100 Angstroms that are simply not 
built for 5V of power. Because 0.5m transistors are 
optimized 
for 3.3V power supplies, even though their gate voltage has been 
reduced from 5V to 3.3V, they possess equal or better drive 
capabilities than previous generation transistors, and are 
approximately 20% faster than previous generation devices.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-02A>      Figure 1. Trends in Number of Gates and Operating Speeds </FIG>

  Another big reason for reducing supply voltage has to do 
with 
measures aimed at power consumption. It is well known that the 
power consumption of large-scale integration (LSI) CMOS devices 
comprised of complementary circuits is not a major problem since 
there are no direct current paths and quiescent power 
dissipation is practically zero. But even the power consumption 
of CMOS circuits, when operated at ultra-high speeds, increases 
on a par with bipolar circuits. The power consumed during 
operation is the switching-generated charging current of the 
parasitic capacity attached to the output node of the gate 
circuit, and is proportional to the average operating frequency, 
as well as to the scale of the gate corresponding to the 
parasitic capacity value. Although scaling down feature sizes 
reduces the average parasitic capacity value per gate, the 
effect of increasing the number of gates more than offsets this, 
the upper limits of operating frequency also rise, and most 
high-end applications suitable for 0.5m devices will 
continue 
to use 5V, increasing power consumption significantly. This will 
make it impossible to use the now popular inexpensive plastic 
flat package (PFP), requiring instead the use of extremely 
expensive ceramic packages with low thermal resistance values 
and/or the construction of heat sinks, resulting in higher 
priced LSIs. Charging current power consumption is generally 
proportional to fcv[.sup]2[/] and the supply 
voltage multiplied by two. Designing devices capable of 
operating on 3.3V of power will reduce power consumption by 
roughly 1/2, enable inexpensive packaging to be used for most 
applications just like before, and will support the trend toward 
lower costs. 
<H5>  Dual 3V/5V Technology </H5>
  Gate arrays with 0.5m dimensions are being designed to 
operate on 3.3V of power, and 3.3V microprocessors, memory 
devices and other products are in the process of being shipped. 
However, hardly any of the general-purpose periphery LSIs are 
being adapted for 3.3V operation, and the standard for buses 
that run inside personal computers (PCs) is still 5V. This turn 
of events will lead to a situation where 3V and 5V circuit 
components will have to co-exist inside a single system, 
requiring that these systems incorporate interfaces to serve as 
bridges between the two types of power sources. However, since 
microprocessors and other general-purpose LSIs are not being 
designed to handle dual power sources, in the end, this role 
will fall to the custom-built LSI ASICs. 
  However, as pointed out above, 0.5m MOS transistors are 
not constructed to withstand 5V of power, meaning that 5V/3.3V 
conversion will be difficult to achieve in 0.5m gate arrays. 
Some sort of circuitry solution will be required instead. Figure 
2 illustrates a 0.5m CMOS circuit capable of handling a 5V 
amplitude input signal. In this circuit, inserting the n-channel 
transistor serially into the input cuts off the high voltage so 
that not more than 3.3V is applied to the inverter circuit 
n-channel transistor, which has a 0V substrate bias. The in-line 
n-channel transistor gate has a bias of 3.3V, and this circuit 
is constructed so that not more than 3.3V of bias is applied to 
any gate regardless of changes in input from 0V to 5V. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-02B>      Figure 2. 5V Input Buffer </FIG>

  There is no simple means of dealing with a 3V-to-5V output 
if, say, a through-current is not permitted in a 5V LSI input 
circuit, or if a CMOS level is required as a result of noise 
margin problems. Conversely, if a 5V LSI requires a 
transistor-transistor logic (TTL) level (0.8-2.0V), then it is 
possible to make the connection with a 0V-to-3.3V amplitude 
output as-is without doing anything. The problem lies with 
tri-state and/or two-way buffers. With an ordinary 3V buffer, 
when the buffer itself is in a high impedance state, 5V of 
voltage can be applied to the output pin from the outside, and 
that voltage level will flow backward (reverse current) from the 
MOS transistor drain region through the parasitic diode to the 
3.3V power source. To prevent this phenomenon, as shown in 
Figure 3, the n-channel transistor must be inserted serially 
into the output pin similar to the way the input circuit was 
designed. Naturally, this transistor will function as an in-line 
resistor when the buffer is in the output mode, lowering the 
buffer's drive capabilities. At high-level output in particular, 
the back-gate bias effect also comes into play, greatly reducing 
drive capabilities. Besides this circuit, there have been 
reports of cases where complicated circuit configurations that 
use floating n-wells have been used to enhance high-level output 
characteristics. But in each of these instances, the 
characteristics deteriorated, and they were of little use in 
high-speed, high-drive-capable buffers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-03A>      Figure 3. 3.3V/5V Tri-state Buffer </FIG>

  An alternative course of action to the 3V/5V interface 
approach, albeit a complicated one, is to simultaneously 
fabricate 0.8m transistors capable of withstanding 5V on top 
of the 0.5m gate array, thereby creating transistors capable 
of 5V input and output. This is called the multi-oxide process 
because it alters the thickness of the oxide films on the gates 
of the 3V and 5V transistors. Table 2 provides an example of the 
specifications of a 0.5m gate array product that employed 
the 
multi-oxide process. This approach makes metal layer switching 
possible at each pin for both 3V I/O and 5V I/O. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-03B>      Table 2. Example of Multi-oxide Gate Array TC183G I/O Buffer Characteristics </FIG>

  Figure 4 shows an example of 3V/5V-conversion I/O buffer 
circuits that made use of the multi-oxide process. Although the 
process is complicated, the circuits themselves are clear-cut. 
The 5V input circuit can also be fabricated using a two-stage 
inverter circuit comprised of 0.8m transistors, which 
compared to the input circuit illustrated in Figure 2, is 
faster, facilitates circuit threshold value control and also has 
a large noise margin. The 5V output buffer makes use of a level 
shifter circuit configured from 0.8m transistors to convert 
the 3V signals coming from the logic circuit inside the gate 
array to the 5V level for output. Even though this level shifter 
circuit causes an additional 1ns delay, this buffer offers 
output characteristics on a par with ordinary 5V gate arrays. 
This buffer readily serves as a direct drive for buses that 
require large load drive capabilities, something the tri-state 
buffer circuit shown in Figure 3 has difficulty doing. This 
buffer is also being adapted for use with the PCI bus, which is 
rapidly coming into widespread use as a next-generation standard. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-04A>      Figure 4. 5V I/O Circuits That Utilize the Multi-oxide Process </FIG>

  Because of the outstanding 5V I/O buffer characteristics of 
the multi-oxide gate array, they are not only finding 
application in dual 3V/5V systems, but are also being used as 5V 
input-3V logic processing-5V output devices in 5V systems that 
require the low power consumption and high speeds of 0.5m 
gate arrays. 
<H5>  High-speed Interfaces </H5>
  As the operating speed of the logic circuits inside gate 
arrays is enhanced, the slowness of signal transmissions between 
multiple LSIs is becoming more pronounced. If we adhere to past 
ways of thinking, it would seem that all we have to do is scale 
down the feature sizes in order to increase the drive 
capabilities and operating speed of the output buffer. But in 
actuality, numerous output buffers operate simultaneously in 
synch with the clock, in which case, the high speed, uniform 
switching of powerful drive buffers generates considerable noise 
on the order of 1V in the power source inside the gate array, 
which in turn causes malfunctions. Power source noise can be 
alleviated by fabricating numerous power source pins, but 
too-fast switching also inhibits high-speed transmission as the 
transmission waveform is distorted owing to the reflected waves 
in the conductors on the printed circuit board. Therefore, it 
has become commonplace for recent gate arrays to offer an 
extremely wide variety of buffers so that you can select those 
with the lowest noise from among buffers that offer combinations 
of the various load drive capabilities and permissible 
transmission times required in output pins. 
  However, no matter how many different kinds of buffers there 
are, that alone will not improve transmission speed. Therefore, 
as one solution to low-noise, high-speed transmission, attention 
has recently focused on small amplitude signal transmission 
systems that enable high-speed transmission by limiting the 
output amplitude without aimlessly increasing load drive 
capabilities. Of these, the GTL system is the closest to 
practicalization, and is starting to gain support as a standard 
cell in 0.5m gate arrays. There is also an emitter-coupled 
logic (ECL)-level small amplitude signal transmission system 
that has been in use for some time. But, although the ECL system 
makes it easy to design the circuit threshold level for bipolar 
circuits, it cannot be realized as readily for CMOS circuits, 
making the ECL system unsuitable for use with CMOS LSIs. But GTL 
system standards were established with CMOS LSIs in mind. As 
Figure 5 indicates, a GTL system driver consists of a solitary 
n-channel transistor. In actual circuits, 
driver-transistor-generated noise is reduced by adding a 
through-rate control circuit to gently control ON/OFF. And the 
input circuit is an ordinary CMOS P-top high-speed comparator. 
Table 3 shows the DC specifications for the GTL system. Note 
that maximum output amplitude is held to 1.2V, and the 
terminating resistance value is assumed to be 50_O_. This 
system 
is suitable for high-speed buses with large load capacities and 
long transmission lines.

  Another, totally different technology that supports 
inter-chip high-speed transmission is phase-locked loop (PLL) 
technology. Ordinarily, signal transmissions between chips are 
synchronized to a system clock supporting multiple chips, and 
transmission takes place in the space of a single clock cycle 
with the signal output from a certain chip's flip-flop being 
derived by another chip's flip-flop at the next clock timing 
pulse. However, as shown in Figure 6, since large-scale gate 
arrays distribute thousands of clocks in a single chip, a 
multi-stage clock buffer is located inside the chip, causing 
unnecessary delays. Thus, a large phase difference exists 
between the system clock on the PCB and the clocks that are 
actually supplying timing pulses to the flip-flops inside the 
chip. In a worst case scenario, this clock phase difference 
itself accounts for the greatest portion of the permissible 
transmission time. As the conceptual diagram provided in Figure 
6 indicates, PLL technology eliminates this phase difference and 
lengthens the effective transmission time permitted by the 
buffer, thereby making high-speed transmission possible. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-05B>      Figure 6. Signal Transmission Circuit Employing PLL </FIG>

  In gate arrays, the structure of the LSI makes it difficult 
to treat an analog circuit PLL as a macro cell. However, as 
shown in Figure 7, it is possible to integrate a PLL into a gate 
array as a cell if it is a digital PLL that uses the gate chain 
to delay the input clock nearly one clock cycle and adjusts 
phase. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are supporting PLL 
technology as a countermeasure to clock phase difference 
beginning with their 0.5m generation gate arrays. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-06A>      Figure 7. Block Diagram of Digital PLL </FIG>

  As described above, considerable improvements are being made 
in inter-chip signal transmission speeds via the joint use of 
small signal amplitude buffers and PLL technology in CMOS gate 
arrays. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  Gate array technology, broadly speaking, is supported by 
device, EDA, packaging and testing technologies. In this report, 
we limited our discussion to device technology strongly 
reflected in CMOS technology. But needless to say, in designing 
the ultra-large-scale gate arrays unique to CMOS gate arrays, 
EDA technology that supports top-down design and technologies 
that facilitate testing techniques are essential. Gate array 
technology will most likely continue to become more and more 
integrated as scaling techniques work to increase gate array 
operating speeds and integration levels.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Today's large-scale-integration (LSI) devices must possess 
higher performance than ever before. As a result, the number of 
transistors per chip and the chip surface areas are steadily 
increasing. The larger chip surface areas require long lines 
with large capacities, and lines to which numerous capacity 
loads are connected. Since this kind of large capacity load must 
be driven at high speed, high-speed, high-performance LSIs are 
better off using bipolar transistors, with their powerful 
current driving capabilities and large transconductance, rather 
than metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors 
(MOSFETs). Therefore, chips designed for high-speed and 
high-performance are employing a bipolar complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductor (BiCMOS) process that combines the 
high integration levels and low power consumption of MOSFETs 
with the high-speed operability of bipolar transistors 
(hereafter abbreviated BJT). 
  Also, as LSIs are made to handle higher levels of 
integration 
and to operate at higher speeds, the power consumption per chip 
continues to increase. To lower the power consumed by chips 
while ensuring reliability in line with the shortening of MOSFET 
gate lengths, all manufacturers are experimenting with processes 
for reducing chip supply voltage. As these processes advance, 
supply voltages will almost certainly drop from 3.3V to 2.5V, 
and then down to 2.0V. 
  However, the operating speed of BiCMOS circuits rapidly 
deteriorates as supply voltage is lowered, making it impossible 
to maintain their superior speed capabilities vis-a-vis CMOS 
circuits. As further advances are made in shortening MOSFET gate 
lengths while reducing supply voltage, it is quite likely that 
future BiCMOS circuits and the BiCMOS process will lose their 
significance. 
  This report was put together on the premise that we are 
entering the age of quarter micron MOSFET gate lengths and 
supply voltages of less than 2V, and introduces a new BiCMOS 
gate that employs circuitry schemes to reduce the degradation of 
characteristics at low-voltage operation prevalent with 
conventional BiCMOS gates, and which is expected to become a 
basic element in high-speed LSI system 
configurations.[.sup]1)[/]

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07B>      Figure 2. BiNMOS Circuit </FIG>

  The basic operation of a BiCMOS circuit consists of the CMOS 
inverter receiving the input signal, that output is then input 
to the base of the BJT, and then using the high current drive 
capabilities of the BJT, the circuit charges/discharges at high 
speed the load connected to the output. This operation is 
illustrated in Figure 3. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07C>      Figure 3. Basic Operation of a BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>

  From Figure 3, the delay time (t[.sub]pd[/]) of 
the BiCMOS circuit can be expressed using two formulas: 
  t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]B[/] x 
V[.sub]F[/]/I[.sub]D[/] + 
C[.sub]L[/] x 
V[.sub]CC[/]/2/I[.sub]C[/] (1) 
  I[.sub]D[/] = g[.sub]m[/] x 
_D_V = g[.sub]m[/] x 
V[.sub]sg[/] (2) 
  C[.sub]B[/] here is the sum of parasitic load 
viewed from the BJT base terminal, V[.sub]F[/] is 
BJT flatband voltage, I[.sub]D[/] is the MOSFET 
drain current, C[.sub]L[/] is external load 
capacity, V[.sub]CC[/] is supply voltage, 
I[.sub]C[/] is the BJT collector current, 
g[.sub]m[/] is the MOSFET mutual conductance, 
_D_V is logic swing and V[.sub]sg[/] is 
the MOSFET source-drain voltage. Part one of Formula (1) 
expresses the internal delay time generated by driving the 
BiCMOS circuit BJT, and part two of the formula expresses the 
delay time involved in driving the external load. When external 
load is small, internal delay time dominates, and the operating 
speed of the BiCMOS circuit is slower than that of a CMOS 
circuit. Conversely, when external load is large, part two of 
Formula (1) becomes larger than part one and the impact of the 
internal delay time portion of t[.sub]pd[/] 
becomes nominal. Therefore, when external load capacity is 
large, part two of Formula (1) dominates, and since the current 
(I[.sub]C[/]) that charges/discharges external 
load becomes h[.sub]FE[/] (- 100) times larger 
than CMOS drain current (I[.sub]D[/]), the BiCMOS 
circuit operates faster than a CMOS circuit. The load capacity 
(crossover capacity) at this time is said to ordinarily be 
around F/O-3, C[.sub]L[/]-0.3pF. 
<H5>  Low Voltage Operation of BiCMOS Circuits </H5>
  Reducing the supply voltage simultaneously decreases logic 
swing. The reduction of logic swing (_D_V) brings 
about a decrease of MOSFET source-drain voltage 
(V[.sub]sg[/]). If we adhere to scaling rules, the 
thinking is that shortening the gate length (L) will 
increase g[.sub]m[/], enabling the reduction of 
I[.sub]D[/] to be prevented. But in actuality, it 
is thought that the existence of properties not affected by 
scaling (such as source resistance (R[.sub]S[/])) 
tend to saturate g[.sub]m[/] growth even if we 
shorten L to the sub-quarter micron regime. 
Therefore, as indicated in Formula (2), in future it is felt 
that reducing supply voltage will depend on reducing drain 
current (I[.sub]D[/]). 
  The reduction of I[.sub]D[/] will lead to a 
drastic increase of part one of Formula (1) in BiCMOS circuits. 
This will increase the internal delay of the BiCMOS gates, and 
reducing supply voltage will make the extent of deterioration of 
high-speed characteristics greater than that of CMOS circuits. 
This will result in crossover capacity moving further toward the 
high load side. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-07D>      Figure 4. Relationship Between Delay Time and Crossover </FIG>

  This is how the reduction of V[.sub]cc[/] in 
BiCMOS circuits manifests itself in an extremely pronounced 
increase of t[.sub]pd[/]. 
  From the above it is clear how the internal delay time 
peculiar to BiCMOS circuits increases as a result of the 
reduction of V[.sub]cc[/], making it impossible 
for the BiCMOS to maintain its superior high-speed operation 
vis-a-vis CMOS circuits. As is clear from Formula (1), the only 
thing that can be done to avoid this situation is to decrease 
either C[.sub]B[/] or V[.sub]F[/]. 
V[.sub]F[/] is pretty much determined by the band 
gap of the silicon material used to fabricate the BJT, and the 
amount of this energy basically cannot be changed. It is also 
possible to decrease C[.sub]EB[/] and reduce 
C[.sub]B[/] by decreasing the size of the BJT 
emitter, but this will simultaneously reduce the emitter current 
value (I[.sub]E[/]) and/or the collector current 
value (I[.sub]C[/]). As pointed out above, we 
don't want a design that sacrifices the BJT's greatest merit, 
its powerful drive current. 
<H5>  New BiCMOS Circuit </H5>
<H5>  1. V </H5>[.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the 
Current Level 
  Figure 5 illustrates the principle behind reducing BJT 
V[.sub]F[/] at the current level in a 
newly-proposed BiCMOS circuit. Circuit-wise, this approach 
ensures that the BJT base potential (V[.sub]B[/]) 
doesn't drop below the ground level. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08A>      Figure 5. Principle Behind Reducing BJT V[.sub]F[/] in BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>

  With this circuit, the BJT base node potential 
(V[.sub]B[/]) shown in Figure 5 does not drop 
below the nMOSFET threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/]). 
At this time, the delay time of the BiCMOS circuit 
(t[.sub]pd[/]) is expressed by the following 
formula: 
  t[.sub]pd[/] = C[.sub]EB[/] x 
(V[.sub]F[/] 
-V[.sub]tn[/])/I[.sub]D[/] + 
C[.sub]L[/] x 
V[.sub]cc[/]/2/I[.sub]c[/] (3) 
  And V[.sub]F[/] is reduced to 
V[.sub]a[/], which is expressed as follows: 
  V[.sub]a[/] = V[.sub]F[/] 
-V[.sub]tn[/] (4) 
  Since in an ordinary process V[.sub]F[/] is 
approximately 0.8V and V[.sub]tn[/] is 
approximately 0.6V, V[.sub]a[/] works out to 
approximately 0.2V. Taking this kind of configuration will 
increase BJT OFF current (I[.sub]off[/]), and the 
degree of increase can be readily estimated vis-a-vis ON current 
(I[.sub]on[/]) using the formula: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08B>      EQUATION </FIG>

  This increase in OFF current is an extremely small 1/2200, 
and can practically be ignored from the standpoint of high-speed 
operation. As used here, q is amount of unit charge, 
k is Boltzmann's constant, 
V[.sub]EB[/](off) = 0.6V, 
V[.sub]EB[/](on) = 0.8V and T = 300K. 
Figure 6, 7 and 8 give examples of BiCMOS circuits designed 
based on this principle. The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7 
operate at V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]F[/] 
at high level output, and at GND + V[.sub]F[/] at 
low level output. With the circuit shown in Figure 8, output low 
potential is lowered to ground level by operating the load 
discharge side of the BJT until the saturation region. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08C>      EQUATION </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-08D>      Figure 6. Example 1 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-09A>      Figure 7. Example 2 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-09B>      Figure 8. Example 3 of New BiCMOS Circuit </FIG>


  The circuits shown in Figures 6 and 7 lower the amount of 
charge needed for BJT ON and OFF, and even if the MOSFET 
I[.sub]D[/] is reduced, BJT ON and OFF can be 
operated at high speed. However, the minimum operating voltage 
for these circuits is 2 V[.sub]F[/] + 
_D_V, so that with V[.sub]F[/] is 
approximately 0.8V, _D_V is approximately 0.8V (in 
this report, we make logic swing the same value as ECL100K, or 
0.8V), V[.sub]cc[/]min is approximately 2.4V. 
Therefore, a BiCMOS circuit that uses BJT for load 
charge-discharge, and operates the BJT in the active region has 
a minimum operating voltage of 2.4V. Operating the load 
discharge BJT of the circuit shown in Figure 8 until the 
saturation region enables the minimum operating voltage of the 
BiCMOS circuit to be reduced to V[.sub]F[/] + 
_D_V is approximately 1.6V. We talk about the 
operational problems encountered by operating the BJT until the 
saturation region later in the report. 
<H5>  2. V </H5>[.sub]F[/] Reduction Viewed from the 
Voltage Level 
  Using only the mechanism discussed above, the most operating 
speed can be improved at low voltage operation is 20-30%. 
This 
is caused by the fact that when an ordinary (enhancement-type) 
nMOSFET is used to turn ON the load discharge BJT as shown in 
Figure 9 (a), the BJT does not operate to the point where the 
input signal potential reaches V[.sub]F[/] + 
Vt (&gt;  0). When considering a supply 
voltage of less than 2V, the input threshold value in this case 
would simply be too large (V[.sub]F[/] + 
V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 1.4V, at 
V[.sub]t[/] is approximately 0. 6V). Therefore, we 
put together a proposal advocating the use of a depletion-type 
MOSFET to turn ON the load discharge BJT (See Figure 9 (b)). In 
this case, the input threshold value for load discharge would be 
V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]t[/] &lt; 
V[.sub]F[/], making possible high-speed load 
discharge.

<H5>  3. Proposal for a LV-BiFET </H5>
  Figure 10 is a graphic illustration of a circuit that 
incorporates the mechanisms discussed in the previous two 
sections. This circuit is felt to be the simplest form of 
achieving the mechanisms discussed in sections 1 and 2 above. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-10A>      Figure 10. LV-BiFET Circuit </FIG>

  We have called the circuit indicated in Figure 10 a 
low-voltage operational bipolar field-effect transistor or 
LV-BiFET. This LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn-type BJT with 
one pMOSFET each and a depletion-type nMOSFET (D-nMOSFET). 
Although we use a D-nMOSFET, its source is connected to the base 
of the BJT, and DC current does not run through the D-nMOSFET 
part. 
<H5>  LV-BiFET Operation </H5>
  We will use Figure 11 to explain the operation of the 
LV-BiFET. Q1, Q2 turn ON voltage is 0.8V, the pMOSFET (M1) 
threshold value (V[.sub]tp[/]) equals 0.65V and 
the D-nMOSFET (M2) threshold value (V[.sub]tn[/]) 
is -0.65V. As a result, the input threshold value of the BiFET 
is GND (0V) + V[.sub]F[/] + 
V[.sub]tn[/] + (substrate effect) or is 
approximately 0.2V on the low level side, and 
V[.sub]cc[/] -V[.sub]tp[/] or 
V[.sub]cc[/] is approximately 0.65V on the high 
level side. Low level output is GND + 
V[.sub]offset[/] (V[.sub]offset[/] 
is the Q2 emitter-collector offset voltage) or 0.05V, and high 
level output is V[.sub]cc[/] - 
V[.sub]F[/] or V[.sub]cc[/] is 
approximately 0.8V. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-10B>      Figure 11. LV-BiFET Basic Operation </FIG>

  Low level input (Figure 11 (a)) turns the pMOSFET (M1) ON, 
turns the D-nMOSFET (M2) OFF, turns the output pull-up BJT (Q1) 
ON and turns the output pull-down BJT (Q2) OFF, thereby 
resulting in high level output (V[.sub]cc[/] - 
V[.sub]F[/]). And high level input (Figure 11 (b)) 
turns M1 OFF, M2 ON, and as a result of M2 conducting the base 
potential, this base potential becomes the same for both Q1 and 
Q2. At this time, Q2 emitter potential is at GND level, and Q1 
emitter potential is transiting from V[.sub]cc[/] 
- V[.sub]F[/] to GND + 
V[.sub]offset[/]. Thus, the voltage between the 
emitter bases (V[.sub]EB[/]) is larger at Q2 than 
at Q1, and output is low level (GND + 
V[.sub]offset[/]). 
  Figure 12 illustrates an output holding operation. At 
low-level input (Figure 12 (a)), M2 sub-threshold current 
(I[.sub]leak[/]) is considerably smaller than M1 
I[.sub]D[/], putting Q1 base potential at the 
V[.sub]cc[/] level and maintaining output at high 
level. When this happens, Q2 base potential is maintained at 
V[.sub]F[/] - V[.sub]a[/]. As used 
here, V[.sub]a[/] represents a minute voltage. At 
high-level input (Figure 12 (b)), M1 turns OFF and M2 turns ON, 
but because the high-level input is V[.sub]cc[/] - 
V[.sub]F[/] and M1 V[.sub]tp[/] is 
set at |V[.sub]tp[/]| &lt; 
|V[.sub]F[/]|, M1 does not turn completely OFF, 
resulting in a minute drain current 
(minute-I[.sub]D[/]). The Q1 and Q2 bases are also 
the same potential at this time. The relationship between this 
minute I[.sub]D[/] and the amount of the Q2 base 
current leak determines the low potential side of the DC base 
potential of Q1 and Q2. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11A>      Figure 12. LV-BiFET Output Holding Operation Principle </FIG>

  At this point, we carried out simulations based on 
Simulation 
Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) parameters of a 
0.55m BiCMOS process (All simulations discussed hereafter 
use 
the same parameters.). And calculation of load capacity and load 
resistance, including source and drain capacity, conformed to a 
4M BiCMOS SRAM design using this process.[.sup]2)[/] In this 
situation, an internal node capacity (BJT base node capacity) of 
F/O approximately 4 is too large, and external load capacity 
pull-down ends before the internal node charge at output 
pull-down decreases sufficiently (before the internal node 
potential drops to V[.sub]F[/] - 
V[.sub]a[/]), resulting in the generation of an 
unnecessary through-current in the BJT. As shown in Figure 13, 
we used an additional element (one BJT and one condensor) to 
evaluate the characteristics of the broad-range F/O on the same 
circuit. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11B>      Figure 13. Characteristics Evaluation Circuit </FIG>

  The BJT equipped with the additional element was for 
extracting the internal node charge at higher speeds. This BJT 
can be eliminated once the proper relationship has been 
established between the internal node capacity and the output 
load capacity. And the condensor (C) is for carrying out Q2 ON 
and OFF operations in active pull-up and pull-down modes by 
coupling with the input. 
  Figure 14 illustrates the voltage waveform when the LV-BiFET 
supply voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4, and Figure 15 shows the 
current waveform. As can be seen from Figure 14, the low-level 
potential of node-A is approximately 0.7V, and the low-level 
potential of node-B is approximately 0.6V, and the effective BJT 
turn-ON voltage (V[.sub]a[/]) is roughly 0.2V. And 
as can be discerned from Figure 15, the DC through-current is so 
small that it can practically be ignored. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-11C>      Figure 14. Voltage Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V and F/O is 4 </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-12A>      Figure 15. Current Waveform When Supply Voltage is 1.6V </FIG>

<H5>  Comparison With Conventional Circuits </H5>
  Next, let's compare the operating speed and power 
consumption 
of the LV-BiFET circuit with conventional circuits. The types of 
conventional circuits targeted for comparison purposes were 
CMOS, BiNMOS, BiCMOS and NTL circuits. Figure 16 indicates the 
circuit constants of the circuits compared. For the sake of 
convenience, we made these comparisons using a one input - one 
output inverter. With the exception of the NTL circuit, the 
input signals to all the other conventional circuits entered 
through the MOS gates and input capacity 
(C[.sub]in[/]) was made a uniform 0.1pF 
(Naturally, the C on the input side of the BiFET also included 
C[.sub]in[/].). Because input to the NTL circuit 
entered through the base of the BJT, C[.sub]in[/] 
was smaller than 0.1pF. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-12B>      Figure 16. Comparison of BiFET Circuit With Conventional Circuits </FIG>

  Figure 17 shows the operating waveforms for all of the 
circuits when supply voltage was 1.6V. The reason supply voltage 
was set at 1.6V was to make the logic swing of the BiFET and 
BiNMOS ECL100K convertible (_D_V = 0.8V), i. e. 
(V[.sub]cc[/] = V[.sub]F[/] + 
_D_V = 0.8V + 0.8V = 1.6V). With 
V[.sub]cc[/] equal to 1.6V, the logic swing of the 
LV-BiFET, CMOS and BiNMOS circuits was 0.8V, 1.6V and 0.8V, 
respectively. Since the NTL circuit could not operate at 1.6V, 
the diagram in Figure 17 shows a waveform for a supply voltage 
of 1.9V and a logic swing of 0.4V. The figure does not show the 
waveform for the BiCMOS circuit compared because the lowest 
supply voltage that a BiCMOS circuit can operate at is 2.4V (2 
V[.sub]F[/] + V[.sub]D[/] = 2 x 0.8V 
+ 0.8V = 2.4V). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13A>      Figure 17. Operating Waveforms For All Circuits Operated at 1.6V </FIG>

  Figure 18 shows the supply voltage 
(|V[.sub]cc[/]-GND|) dependence of delay time 
when F/O is equal to 4. The operating speed of the LV-BiFET was 
second only to that of the NTL circuit when supply voltage was 
under 3V. The reason the NTL circuit operating speed improved as 
supply voltage was reduced is because its logic swing decreased 
together with the supply voltage as a result of calculating the 
delay time by fixing the resistance value used in the circuit. 
Just as with the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits, the delay 
time of the LV-BiFET increased in line with the reduction of 
supply voltage, but this increase in delay time was smaller than 
that recorded for the CMOS, BiCMOS and BiNMOS circuits due to 
the effects of artificially lowering the BJT turn ON voltage. 
Also, since the LV-BiFET was designed for optimum operation at 
1.6V, it exhibited about the same delay time as the BiNMOS at 
supply voltages of 3V or more, and the effect of lowering the 
BJT turn ON voltage was not very pronounced. The LV-BiFET can 
also be designed for high-speed operation by optimizing it to 
operate at around 3V. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13B>      Figure 18. Supply Voltage Dependence of Delay Time at F/O = 4 </FIG>

  Figure 19 graphically depicts power consumption as a 
function 
of supply voltage when F/O is 4 and operating frequency is 
100MHz. The LV-BiFET exhibited the lowest power consumption of 
all the circuits compared at supply voltages ranging between 
1.6-3.5V. This can be accounted for by the fact that the 
LV-BiFET's logic swing had a smaller V[.sub]F[/] 
(= 0.8V) than the CMOS circuit, by the fact that the LV-BiFET 
transistors operated at high speed at the output stage, and the 
LV-BiFET employed BJT with greater drive capabilities for both 
output pull-up and pull-down, and by the fact that the LV-BiFET 
exhibited a smaller through-current at the output stage than the 
BiNMOS circuit. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13C>      Figure 19. Power Consumption as a Function of Supply Voltage At F/O = 4 and 100MHz </FIG>

  The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely superior operating 
characteristics at 1.6V compared to those of both the CMOS and 
BiNMOS circuits, recording 1.7-times the operating speed and 
45% less power consumption than the CMOS circuit, and 
1.7-times 
the operating speed and 35% less power consumption than 
the 
BiNMOS circuit. 
  Figures 20 and 21 depict LV-BiFET delay time and power 
consumption at 100MHz as a function of fanout when operating at 
1.6V. The LV-BiFET exhibited extremely small dependence on 
fanout due to the fact that it charges/discharges external 
additional load using BJTs with large load drive capacities. 
Also, as was already shown earlier, because the LV-BiFET reduces 
the characteristic self-delay time of the BiCMOS (the time 
expressed in part one of Formula (3)), its delay time crossover 
point with the CMOS circuit is less than fanout 1, making it 
faster than CMOS circuits at all fanouts ordinarily considered. 
The delay time for the LV-BiFET came in second only to that for 
the NTL circuit, and for the reasons stipulated in the previous 
section on supply voltage dependence, the LV-BiFET exhibited the 
lowest power consumption for all fanouts. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-13D>      Figure 20. Delay Time as a Function of Fanout at 1.6V </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-14A>      Figure 21. Power Consumption as a Function of Fanout at 100MHz </FIG>

  Figure 22 shows the relationship between power consumption 
and delay time. At 1.6V of supply voltage, the LV-BiFET 
exhibited a 70% smaller power-delay product than the CMOS 
circuit, a 60% smaller power-delay product than the BiNMOS 
circuit and a 55% smaller power-delay product than the NTL 
circuit. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-14B>      Figure 22. Power Consumption-Delay Time Relationship (at F/O = 4, 100MHz) </FIG>

  Table 1 lists up the characteristics of all the circuits 
compared. The LV-BiFET used for simulation purposes exhibited 
the smallest power-delay product of all the circuits compared, 
recording at 1. 6V of operating power a 70%, 60% 
and 55% 
smaller power-delay product than the CMOS, BiNMOS and NTL 
circuits, respectively. At present, the one drawback of the 
LV-BiFET is its large surface area overhead resulting from its 
use of two BJT. And as shown in Figure 13, when an additional 
circuit is attached to the LV-BiFET, its surface area equals 
that of a BiCMOS. However, the merits of being able to achieve 
high-speed operation and low power consumption at the low supply 
voltage of 1.6V are considerable.

<H5>  Process Dependence of Operating Characteristics </H5>
  Just as with CMOS circuits, the delay time and power 
consumption characteristics of the LV-BiFET change in response 
to changes in the MOSFET V[.sub]t[/]. Based on the 
circuit depicted in Figure 16 (a), we used SPICE simulation 
processing to predict changes in the pMOSFET and nMOSFET 
V[.sub]t[/]. At 1.6V, when the respective 
V[.sub]t[/] fluctuated between +0. 1V and -0.1V, 
delay time only deteriorated around 3%, but power 
consumption 
increased a maximum of two-fold. This occurred when 
|V[.sub]tp[/]| decreased. The increase in the 
minute drain current of the pMOSFET shown in Figure 12 (b) was 
caused by delaying the pull-up BJT Q1 turn OFF and created a 
through-current between Q1 and Q2. Therefore, in order to make 
the most of LV-BiFET characteristics, you must pay adequate 
attention to the increase in the pMOSFET threshold voltage 
(V[.sub]t[/]) (the decrease in the 
|V[.sub]tp[/]|). 
  To operate the LV-BiFET at less than 2V, operate the output 
pull-down BJT until it reaches the saturation region. In our 
SPICE simulations, we employed a T[.sub]F[/] of 
approximately 20ps and a T[.sub]R[/] of 
approximately 2ns. There are considerable problems concerning 
the time required to draw out the excess carriers in a base, but 
with the LV-BiFET, even when we increased the 
T[.sub]R[/] value to 10ns and carried out 
simulation, there was very little impact on the operating 
characteristics of the circuit. This is because the BJT used in 
the LV-BiFET are only operated in the small base voltage range 
(However, if the T[.sub]R[/] value is increased 
more than a single digit, normal operation ceases to be 
possible.). And since it will be possible in the age of LSIs 
that operate on 2V or less supply voltage to design BJT with low 
voltage resistance, designers will have much more freedom in 
their design of bases and collectors. Thus, we feel it is easy 
to design BJTs themselves so that they exhibit relatively low 
T[.sub]R[/] values. 
  The drawbacks to LV-BiFETs are their large layout surface 
areas, the fact that their pMOSFET threshold voltage 
(V[.sub]t[/]) increases 
(|V[.sub]tp[/]| decreases) and power consumption 
increases. But as progress is made in scaling down MOSFETs, 
LV-BiFETs should prove very useful from the standpoint that they 
will furnish the same advantages as BiCMOS circuits even at 
supply voltages of under 2V. Also, if a process can be developed 
for integrating the MOSFET source-drain region and BJT base 
regions, then it should be possible to eliminate the use of 
additional circuits even when F/O is small. What is more, the 
BJT we used in simulation processing this time were BiCMOS 
process transistors based primarily on f[.sub]T[/] 
is approximately 10GHz CMOS. However, if we utilize faster BJT, 
we should be able to achieve LV-BiFET with even more superior 
characteristics vis-a-vis CMOS and BiNMOS circuits. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  This report has served as an introduction of a new 
high-speed 
BiCMOS (LV-BiFET) circuit that operates at 1.6V and has a 0.8V 
logic swing. The LV-BiFET is comprised of two npn bipolar 
transistors, one pMOSFET and one depletion-type nMOSFET, and 
achieves high-speed operation at low voltage by using circuitry 
schemes to artificially reduce the turn ON voltage of the 
bipolar transistors. The results of SPICE simulations made it 
possible to estimate that with an F/O of 4, a supply voltage of 
1.6V and an operating frequency of 100MHz, the LV-BiFET is 
1.7-times faster and consumes 45% less power than a 
conventional CMOS circuit, and is 1.7-times faster and consumes 
35% less power than a BiNMOS circuit. The LV-BiFET is even 
faster and consumes less power than a conventional CMOS circuit 
when in a low load state of F/O = 1. 
  Although there are a number of drawbacks to LV-BiFET, such 
as 
their large layout surface area and the need to pay close 
attention to circuit design, we believe that in the age of low, 
2V or less supply voltage, the LV-BiFET points out one direction 
for achieving high-speed, high-performance LSI (BiCMOS LSI).

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The demand for higher speeds in telecommunications and 
information processing systems will continue unabated. This 
holds especially true in the field of telecommunications, where 
great expectations are being placed on semiconductor integrated 
circuits (ICs) that employ ultra-high-speed devices as the 
technology for supporting the broadband integrated services 
digital networks (B-ISDN) expected to form the infrastructure 
for our economy in the 21st Century. 
  Fully-customized designs offer the best approach to the 
ultra-high-speed IC designs required to get the most out of 
device performance, but when system development time and costs 
are figured into the equation, employing fully-customized 
designs for each and every IC would place a considerable burden 
on IC development. This is where silicon emitter coupled logic 
(ECL) gate arrays come in. Silicon ECL gate arrays, with their 
semi-customized designs, not only enable development times to be 
shortened and costs reduced, but also offer the most effective 
means of developing ICs for use in ultra-high-speed systems 
thanks to the advantages of silicon devices over compound 
semiconductors from the standpoints of reliability, mass 
production and a proven track record. There are current 
reports[.sup]1)[/] of a 9.5 gigabits per second (Gb/s) 
discrimination decision circuit and a 6.7Gb/s 4:1 multiplexer 
(MUX) that employ 156-gate silicon ECL arrays. 
  This report discusses the results of studies on a 216-gate 
silicon ECL gate array employing super self-aligned process 
technology-1C (SST-1C)[.sup]2)[/] to fabricate 0.5m SST 
bipolar transistors. 
  To evaluate gate array characteristics, we carried out 
measurement evaluations on a chip equipped with D-type 
flip-flops (DFF), toggle flip-flops (TFF), 4:1 MUX and other key 
elements in optical transmission systems. The maximum operating 
speeds of these various elements worked out to 10.0Gb/s, 10.1GHz 
and 9.0Gb/s, respectively, achieving a 10Gb/s-class signal 
processing IC on top of the silicon ECL gate array. 
<H5>  Basic Cell Layout </H5>
  The basic cells are comprised of 28 transistors and 28 sets 
of resistors (three resistors to a set), and one basic cell can 
form one master-slave flip-flop. Internal logic swing is a 
standard 400mV, and the transistors inside the cells operate at 
0.4mA and 0.8mA. As shown in Figure 1, there are three resistor 
elements in the substrate of a basic cell for each transistor 
emitter and collector, and the resistance value can only be 
changed at line connections. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-16A>      Figure 1. Layout of Resistance Value-Variable Basic Cells </FIG>

  Because the substrate of gate array ICs is determined prior 
to routing, it is difficult to change current in accordance with 
the type or purpose of a cell, and in the end, this results in 
the power dissipation of the entire chip increasing to higher 
than necessary levels. However, by using the above-described 
resistance value-variable basic cell substrates, total chip 
power dissipation can be held down by optimizing the power 
consumption of each cell. In this study, in particular, so as to 
obtain greater circuit current variation with fewer resistor 
elements, we employed a three-resistor element resistance value 
ratio of 1:2:4 to enable the realization of 17 different 
resistance values. 
<H5>  Chip Layout </H5>
  The chip substrate layout is as shown in Figure 2 and 
comprises 6 x 6 internal cells (basic cells) surrounded by 
output buffer cells. The input buffers are configured using the 
basic cells. There are 216 equivalence gates. The standard 
voltage generation circuits are divided into those for the 
internal circuits (V[.sub]CS[/]) and those for the output 
buffers (V[.sub]CSX[/]), and are located in the four corners 
of the chip. Output emitter follower transistors for when ECL 
interfaces are used are located in the vicinity of the pads. The 
chip is 2.5 x 2.5mm in size. Supply voltage is furnished via a 
single -4.5V power source, with the standard voltage 
(V[.sub]TT[/], V[.sub]CS[/], V[.sub]CSX[/] and 
V[.sub]BB[/]) used inside this chip being generated 
internally. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-17A>      Figure 2. Chip Layout </FIG>

  Figure 3 compares the structure of the SST-1C device with 
that of a SST transistor (SST-1B[.sup]3)[/]) with 1m 
feature sizes. SST-1C made possible the introduction of 0.5m 
lithography using ion beams, and an embedded collector electrode 
structure[.sup]4)[/] using phosporus-doped multi-crystal 
silicon. And element isolation was accomplished using a 
flattening LOCOS[.sup]5)[/] and silicon-filled trenches. 
These scaling techniques made it possible to reduce the area 
occupied by transistors to roughly 60% of what it is for 
similar 1m SST collector current transistors. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-17B>      Figure 3. </FIG>

  And in forming the base, we achieved a high-density base 
region with a steep impurity distribution by ion implanting 
BF[.sub]2[/] into the thin oxide film and diffusing this by 
means of rapid thermal aneal (RTA). And to suppress the Kirk 
(phonetic) effect, we employed a selective ion-implanted 
collector (SIC) structure.[.sup]6)[/] These high-speed 
inducing techniques made it possible to achieve 40.7GHz 
(f[.sub]T[/]) when V[.sub]CE[/] is 
1V. We established collector-emitter voltage at around 3.6V. 
Using the SST-1C process, we achieved a 22.4GHz 1/8 frequency 
divider. 
<H5>  Results of Measurement Evaluation </H5>
  Each of the prototype chips was packaged in ceramic 
packaging 
developed for use with ultra-high-speed silicon ICs, and 
measured using a dedicated jig. 
<H5>  1. Transmitter-receiver Terminal-aligned Collector-level </H5>
Output Buffer 
  As the ultra-high-speed circuit interface, there is a method 
that derives the signal at the collector level, called the SCFL 
interface.[.sup]7)[/] Contrary to the conventional ECL 
interface, the SCFL interface doesn't require a terminal voltage 
(V[.sub]TT[/]), enabling it to hold down on post-packaging 
waveform deterioration, and making it especially suitable for 
use on ultra-high-speed IC interface system. 
  When the transmission-reception terminals are aligned at 
50_O_, using this system to establish an open emitter-style 
logic swing of 0.8V requires 32mA of current and increases power 
consumption. At this point, we looked at the achievements made 
with GaAs MESFETs and strove to reduce power consumption by 
making transmission terminal resistance 100_O_. Figure 4 shows 
the circuit configuration of the collector-level output buffer 
we designed. We went with a two-stage pre-buffer + main buffer 
configuration because the basic cell final output is through a 
0.8mA emitter follower transistor, and when direct drive is 
applied to the 24mA transistor that forms the final stage of the 
output buffer, fanout load increases excessively and output 
waveform rise and fall weakens. Power consumption with this 
output buffer is 236mW. 

  When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the 
output level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease 
slightly at around 6Gb/s. Figure 5 shows the output waveform at 
10Gb/s. The chip measured was a DFF. The height of the 
eye-pattern opening at 10Gb/s was around 530mV. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-18A>      Figure 4. Collector-level Output Buffer </FIG>

<H5>  2. ECL Output Buffer </H5>
  We used the collector-level output buffer substrate to 
configure an ECL output buffer, and did so in such a way as to 
enable it to serve as an ECL interface as well. We configured 
this ECL output buffer by adding a final-stage 24mA emitter 
follower transistor to the collector-level output buffer in the 
vicinity of the pad. The power consumption of this output 
buffer, excluding that of the final-stage emitter follower 
transistor, is 210mW. 
  We used an ECL terminator to measure the output waveform. 
When we checked operating frequency sensitivity of the output 
level, we found that the output amplitude began to decrease at 
around 6Gb/s. Figure 6 shows the output waveform at 10Gb/s. The 
chip measured was a DFF. The height of the eye-pattern opening 
at 10Gb/s was around 500mV. 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-18B>      Figure 5. Collector-level Output Wave (10Gb/s) </FIG>

<H5>  3. Results of TFF Measurements </H5>
  We utilized the resistance value-variable basic cell 
substrate to design three types of TFF with different current 
values. The transistors are the same size. Figure 7 indicates 
the current sensitivities of the maximum operating frequencies 
of these circuits. I[.sub]CS[/] as used here is 
the current value vis-a-vis the ECL differential. Changes in the 
current value, i.e. the basic cell substrate resistance value, 
effected changes in the maximum operating frequency similar to 
those exhibited during simulations, thus confirming the 
advantages of a resistance value-variable substrate. The maximum 
operating frequency of the TFF was 10.1GHz, and their 
sensitivity was around 75mV at 6GHz. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-19A>      Figure 6. ECL Output Waveform (10Gb/s) </FIG>

  We also confirmed that even low current circuits with 
I[.sub]CS[/] of 0.25mA operated at 4.5GHz, and 
could process signals in the multi-gigabit range at low voltage. 
<H5>  4. Results of DFF Measurements </H5>
  We measured a circuit to which we had added an input buffer 
and collector-level output buffer to the master-slave DFF. 
Figure 8 shows the operating waveform of this DFF at 10Gb/s. The 
maximum operating speed of this circuit was recorded at 10Gb/s, 
this being the upper limit of the measurement system used. These 
measurements confirmed error free operation at a code error rate 
of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] for psuedo-random signals with 
data lengths of 2[.sup]23[/]-1. Data sensitivity suddenly 
deteriorated around 6Gb/s. At 5Gb/s, data sensitivity was about 
100mV. This sensitivity deterioration was probably due to the 
lack of a dedicated input buffer cell. The phase margin at 5Gb/s 
was 250, and at 10Gb/s was 50. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-19B>      Figure 7. Current Sensitivity of TFF Maximum Operating Frequency </FIG>

<H5>  5. Results of 4:1 MUX Measurements </H5>
  Figure 9 provides a schematic diagram of a 4:1 MUX. This 4:1 
MUX multiplexes four data elements by repeating the operation of 
a 2:1 MUX two times. We configured this 2:1 MUX of a 
master-slave DFF (MS-DFF), a tri-stage DFF (TS-DFF) and a 2:1 
selector, and designed it so it would be able to assure a large 
phase margin. We also fabricated a re-timing DFF at the stage 
prior to the output buffer for waveform shaping. The output 
buffer performs collector-level output. All signals in the 
circuit, with the exception of input clock and data signals, are 
differential signals. Also, by using a resistance value-variable 
basic cell substrate, we attempted to decrease the power level, 
reducing the power required by the low-speed block (first-stage 
2:1 MUX) to 35% of that of the high-speed block 
(second-stage 
2:1 MUX) with the same function. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-20A>      Figure 8. DFF Operating Waveform (10Gb/s) </FIG>



<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-21A>      Figure 9. Schematic Diagram of 4:1 MUX </FIG>

  Figure 10 shows the operating waveforms of the 4:1 MUX at 
6.0Gb/s. These measurements confirmed error free operation at a 
code error rate of less than 10[.sup]-9[/] after multiplexing 
1/4-speed psuedo-random signals with data lengths of 
2[.sup]23[/]-1 derived from a pulse pattern generator. 
Maximum operating speed was 9.0Gb/s. The 1/4 dividing waveform 
began to distort when operating speeds exceeded this maximum 
speed, leading us to believe that the operation of the 
first-stage TFF is restricting the performance of the 4:1 MUX. 
Phase margins were 250 at 5Gb/s, and 100 at 8Gb/s. The 
power consumption of the chip, including that of the I/O buffer, 
was 1.2W. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-22A>      Figure 10. 4:1 MUX Operating Waveform (6.0Gb/s) </FIG>

<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  We studied a 216-gate ECL gate array using a new silicon 
bipolar transistor process called SST-1C. The maximum operating 
speeds of the DFF, 4:1 MUX and TFF fabricated on top of this 
gate array were 10.0Gb/s, 9.0Gb/s and 10.1GHz, respectively, 
realizing a 10Gb/s-class signal processor IC on the silicon ECL 
gate array. 
  We also studied a transmission-reception terminal-aligning 
collector-level output buffer and ECL output buffer, confirming 
that they both operated at favorable eye-patterns up to 10Gb/s. 
  Using a resistance value-variable basic cell substrate in 
the 
gate array basic cells, we configured a 4:1 MUX that controlled 
the current value of the cell in accordance with block operating 
speeds, and confirmed that this MUX is effective in reducing 
chip power consumption. Table 1 provides a list of the main 
specifications of the chip we studied.

<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  Gallium-arsenide (GaAs) gate arrays have recently begun to 
be 
applied to fields requiring high-speed processing, such as those 
related to upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure, 
supercomputers aimed primarily at research institutions, and the 
broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN), a 
telecommunications network for the high-speed transmission of 
huge volumes of data, beginning with image data associated with 
multimedia capabilities. 
  Bipolar emitter-coupled logic (ECL) were the principal 
devices used for these purposes in the past, but GaAs 
technology, with features such as ultra-high-speed operation, 
low power consumption and high integratability, is steadily 
replacing bipolar technology in these fields. 
  Advances in GaAs technology in recent years has made 
possible 
the mass production of large-scale-integration (LSI) logic 
devices, and thanks to enhanced mass producability and lower 
costs, GaAs gate arrays are now less expensive to fabricate than 
ECL devices, being on a par with bipolar complementary 
metal-oxide semiconductors (BiCMOS). GaAs technology is becoming 
generally accepted as a commercial technology for use in 
manufacturing and consumer industries. 
  GaAs digital LSI technology consists primarily of 0.8m 
feature sizes. But work is pushing ahead to further increase the 
operating speed of these devices, and the ``GG11/12'' series of 
0.5m GaAs gate arrays announced by Fujitsu Ltd. in June, 
1993, together with the ``FX'' series of Vitesse 0.6m gate 
arrays, are now world technology leaders. Scaling aimed at 
developing devices with yet faster operating speeds and lower 
power consumption will continue to advance in future. 
<H5>  Expanding Application Fields </H5>
  Up until now, GaAs digital ICs have been more or less 
limited 
to integration levels of several hundred gates for use primarily 
as high-speed ATE (automatic measurement tools), and 
multiplexers (MUX) and demultiplexers (DEMUX) for 622M-2.4Gb/s 
telecommunications. 
  However, GaAs arrays with tens of thousands of gates have 
recently been installed in supercomputers (such as Fujitsu's 
supercomputer ``VPP-500''). 
  Future applications for these devices are expanding into the 
fields of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches for the 
growing market for B-ISDN, LSIs for fiberoptic 
telecommunications at transmission speeds ranging from 
155M-1.5Gb/s, prescalers for mobile communications systems, 
HDC/memory controllers, high-speed image processing LSI for 
personal computers (PCs) and engineering workstations (EWS), and 
LSIs that serve as telecommunication links in local area 
networks (LANs) used for computer-to-computer communications 
with everything from mainframe computers to PCs. 
  Because GaAs devices have generally been more expensive to 
produce, they have been considered applicable only to high-end 
machines and equipment. But thanks to real mass production 
fabrication facilities such as Fujitsu's Custom Device plant, 
coupled with improved yields and characteristic stability, GaAs 
gate arrays are now on a par with BiCMOS devices price-wise, and 
are finding applications in more and more familiar machines and 
equipment. For example, GaAs LSIs are being used in Intel's 
pentium cache controllers. Table 1 provides a list of specific 
applications to which GaAs LSIs are being put.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-24A>      Table 2. Comparison of GaAs Gate Arrays with Other Technologies </FIG>

<H5>  1. CMOS </H5>
  When it comes to actual working gates, CMOS integration has 
advanced to the point where the maximum number of gates possible 
is over 150,000 gates, and gate arrays with feature sizes of 
0.5m have been practicalized. And CMOS devices that operate 
at system speeds of over 100MHz have been commercialized. 
  Cost-performance-wise, GaAs gate arrays can't begin to 
compete with CMOS devices in applications that require less than 
100MHz; this is the CMOS domain, and generally speaking, GaAs 
applications simply do not exist. 
  In the over 100MHz range, however, even CMOS power 
consumption cannot be ignored. 
  Figure 2 compares the power consumption of GaAs and CMOS at 
the basic gate level. Although CMOS power consumption is smaller 
below 50MHz, over 50MHz, GaAs power consumption becomes smaller 
than that of CMOS. This is because even though direct coupled 
field-effect transistor logic (DCFL), the basic circuit in GaAs 
devices, runs at steady-state current and consumes power even 
when in a non-operative state, because DCFL feature a low logic 
swing of roughly 0.6V, the increase in the amount of power 
consumed by capacitive load drive is negligible. 

  With CMOS, because amplitude swings practically up to the 
supply voltage, load drive power consumption increases in 
proportion to the frequency. Capacitive load power consumption 
(P[.sub]W[/]) can be expressed as follows: 
  P[.sub]W[/] = fcv[.sup]2[/] 
  And when CMOS supply voltage is 3.3V, the power consumption 
of CMOS compared to that of GaAs is roughly 30-times higher. 
This difference is expressed as follows: 
  GaAs DCFL : P[.sub]W[/] = 
fc(0.6)[.sup]2[/] 
  CMOS : P[.sub]W[/] = 
fc(3.3)[.sup]2[/] 
  Here f is the operating frequency, c is 
the drive load capacity and v is the logic swing. 
  At the chip level, as shown in Figure 3, GaAs power 
consumption becomes smaller than CMOS consumption at around 
140MHz and above. This indicates that GaAs will have the 
advantage over CMOS as system operating frequencies continue to 
rise in future. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-24B>      Figure 2. Comparison of Power Consumption of GaAs and CMOS Basic Gates </FIG>

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-24C>      Figure 3. Comparison of Power Consumption in GaAs and CMOS Chips </FIG>

  In the field of new processors such as RISC, the operating 
speeds of which will increase even further in future, these 
high-speeds are being dealt with using parallel architectures 
such as super pipelines and super scalers that become plus or 
minus 200MHz CMOS clocks. But it is getting harder and harder to 
get around the intricate circuitry and increasing power 
consumption. 
  It is becoming increasingly likely that single architecture 
GaAs technology with its high-speed operation and comparatively 
low power consumption will find application in these fields as 
well. 
<H5>  2. ECL </H5>
  ECL devices with tens of thousands of gates have been 
practicalized. However, circuitry-wise, the ECL approach poses 
problems when it comes to increasing integration levels. And as 
power consumption increases in line with higher levels of 
integration, forced cooling with liquid coolants will become 
inevitable. Thus, in addition to LSI costs, extra costs will be 
required for these cooling measures and for power supply 
capacity. 
  GaAs devices consume only 1/4 to 1/3 of the power consumed 
by 
ECL. Therefore, an ECL operating at 1.5W, the limit for natural 
air cooling, will only have about 1,000 gates, whereas a GaAs 
gate array operating at this same power level could be equipped 
with up to 10,000 gates (See Figure 4). Also, the size ratio of 
a basic ECL gate is roughly 20-times bigger than that of a GaAs 
device, making the ECL device inferior to the GaAs gate array in 
terms of degree of integration as well. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-25A>      Figure 4. Comparison of Degree of Integration and Power Consumption Between GaAs and ECL Devices </FIG>

  In addition, the fabrication process for ECL devices is more 
complicated than that for GaAs arrays and CMOS devices. This 
process promises to become even more complex in future as 
manufacturers of ECL devices strive to increase operating 
speeds, and the higher fabrication costs will prove a drawback 
for ECL. 
  Since GaAs gate arrays consume less power than ECL devices 
and are on a par with CMOS when it comes to gate size and 
fabrication processes, from the standpoints of integration and 
fabrication costs, GaAs arrays are sufficiently competitive with 
ECL devices. It is felt this will result in a switch to GaAs 
from ECL in future. 
<H5>  3. GaAs </H5>
  Since GaAs devices are capable of integration levels on a 
par 
with CMOS, GaAs gate arrays with 150,000 working gates have 
already been practicalized. 
  Speed is a trade off with number of gates, but GaAs gate 
arrays with several tens of thousands of gates will be capable 
of operating at system speeds of approximately 800MHz. And 
scaling should make it possible to increase this speed in future. 
  GaAs devices operate at low supply voltage. Fujitsu's GG11 
gate array strives to lower power consumption by setting 
internal supply voltage at 1.2V. Thus, especially when it comes 
to increasing the level of integration of large-scale systems, 
GaAs gate arrays offer a plus in that their ability to operate 
at low supply voltage can reduce power consumption. 
  Gate delay time hardly changes at all when supply voltage 
ranges between 1-2V (see Figure 5). Therefore, the portable 
equipment and other fields where advances are being made toward 
lowering supply voltage are ideal fields for the application of 
GaAs devices capable of operating on a single 1.2V battery. 

  GaAs devices are also expected to find applications in 
mobile 
telecommunications, the market for which is growing steadily.

  With its new GG series, development of which commenced in 
June 1993, Fujitsu scaled-down gate length to 0.5m in an 
attempt to increase operating speed. Figure 6 shows photographs 
of a 0.5m GG series 25K-gate chip and packaged device. 

<H5>  1. 0.5m GG Series Process </H5>
  To suppress the short channel effect, we employed embedded p 
layer LDD structures for the basic elements, and achieved gate 
lengths of 0.5m. 
  Our major tasks were enhancing yield as we increased the 
degree of integration, and holding down on the dispersion of the 
threshold voltage in particular. By employing self-aligning 
technology that uses high-heat resistant tungsten silicide in 
the gate electrodes we were able to increase the degree of 
integration and to achieve favorable Schottky characteristics. 
<H5>  2. Mass Production System </H5>
  Fabrication capabilities for GaAs gate arrays have posed a 
problem in the past, so Fujitsu constructed a dedicated GaAs LSI 
fabrication line and commenced mass production of these devices 
in earnest in 1991. 
  This new dedicated GaAs LSI line, the largest of its kind in 
the world, has been installed at the Fujitsu Custom Device plant 
in Showa-machi, Nakakyoma-gun (phonetic) near Kofu-shi in 
Yamanashi Prefecture, and is operating together with other 
fabrication lines there that have been turning out compound 
semiconductor products such as optical semiconductor elements 
and microwave semiconductor elements for some time now. 
  The full-scale commencement of this mass production line has 
enhanced yield, shortened fabrication time and made possible 
stable supplies of GaAs LSIs. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-27A>      Figure 6. Photographs of a 0.5m GG Series Chip and </FIG>

<H5>  3. Cost Performance </H5>
  The wafers used to fabricate GaAs LSI are 4-inches in 
diameter, which is small compared to the 6- to 8-inch wafers 
used for silicon MOS. The manufacturers of these wafers have 
already test manufactured 6-inch sizes, and the switch to 6-inch 
GaAs LSI wafers will be taking place before to long. 
  Unlike silicon, which exists in unlimited amounts, gallium 
and arsenide are rare materials. At present, stable supplies of 
these rare materials are being maintained via refining 
processes, but they are expensive compared to silicon material. 
  Seven masks are used in the fabrication of GaAs LSI using 
bulk processing techniques. This is about on a par with the 
number of masks used to fabricate silicon MOS devices, but works 
out to less than half the masks needed for silicon bipolar 
devices. Although the cost of GaAs wafers is rather high, since 
manufacturing costs are equal to those for silicon MOS devices, 
total costs are not really that much higher. 
  And if we calculate in the improved yields achieved with 
GaAs 
LSI, overall costs drop to the level of those for silicon-based 
BiCMOS. 
<H5>  Future GaAs Trends </H5>
  The size of the chip itself makes it nearly impossible to 
reduce the cost of producing large-scale gate arrays with over 
100,000 gates. Large-scale system LSIs aimed at the 
supercomputer market have high value-added, and are in demand 
despite their relatively high price tags. However, LSIs aimed at 
the manufacturing and consumer products markets must fall into 
the category of high-performance, low-cost devices. In the 
future, therefore, manufacturers of GaAs LSIs targeting these 
markets will focus on productive-size series in the under 
40,000-gate class. It isn't possible to keep up with 
applications requiring increasingly complicated, high functions 
with gate array technology alone. 
  In particular, it will be necessary to provide high-speed, 
large-capacity random access memory (RAM) for the ATM switches 
used in B-ISDN so essential for future high-speed, 
large-capacity data transmission functions, the PLL technology 
imperative for future telecommunications applications, and 
high-speed analog technologies such as analog-digital converters 
(ADC)/digital-analog converters (DAC) and LDD. Steps must 
urgently be taken to create systems for developing custom ICs 
and the standard cell technology built-into so-called analog 
macros. This cannot be handled simply by the high gate 
integration levels capable with GaAs. It will be these other 
technologies that determine the extent that GaAs ICs, with their 
high-speed, low-voltage operation, are utilized in future in the 
high value-added field of mobile communications. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  GaAs MESFET technology with 0.5m dimensions has already 
been practicalized. Scaling will continue in future in an 
attempt to increase operating speeds yet further, but the short 
channel effect prevalent in GaAs MESFETs makes scaling down 
below the 0.5m level difficult. High electron mobility 
transistors (HEMT) and other heterojunction devices will have to 
be introduced to enable scaling to proceed to the 0.35m 
level. 
  Technology is now being practicalized that will not only be 
able to reduce power consumption during standby like CMOS can, 
but should also make it possible to shave almost a whole digit 
off the amount of power consumed by CMOS during 
operation.[.sup]1)[/] This is a complementary-type circuit 
with a metal-insulator-silicon (MIS) structure that employs 
heterojunction technology. These technologies should expand 
applications of GaAs LSIs in mobile communications equipment, 
which are being designed for ever faster operating speeds and 
lower power consumption.

  [Text] Toshiba Corporation (President, Fumio Sato) and 
Professor Masao Toyoda of Osaka University have jointly 
developed a thermal stress analysis system for multi-layered 
coating materials such as functionally gradient materials. Up to 
now, decisions on selection and thickness of coating materials 
for gas turbines were largely left up to experts' experience. 
The gas turbines were coated with highly resistant materials 
against severe environmental conditions. The new development has 
made it possible to assess proper thickness and stress by 
specifying materials and the condition under which the materials 
are being used. It now will be possible to design coatings to 
prevent thermal stress quantitatively, a serious problem in the 
past. 
  The equipment used in high performance gas turbines, fast 
breeder reactors, and nuclear fusion reactors are coated with 
highly durable materials to enable them to stand up under high 
temperatures. The newly developed system is automatically able 
to analyze thermal stress and residual stress of functionally 
gradient materials with Toshiba's notebook personal computers. 
The thermal stress analysis software uses a steady thermal 
stress analysis routine based on steady heat conduction analysis 
and the strain control method. This enables easy analysis of 
thermal stress and residual stress in layered composite 
materials such as FGM. A database in the computer contains 
material constants for various kinds of heat resistant materials 
and severe environment resistant coating materials which 
Professor Toyoda and his group at Osaka University have 
developed. The new system develops new data of actual gradient 
coatings using this database. Once the type of FGM to be used is 
decided, the properties of intermediate compositions of FGMs can 
be calculated automatically by specifying the number of layers, 
surface materials, and bonding materials which will be used. 
Stress distribution within the FGM at particular temperatures 
can be calculated easily when temperature conditions are entered. 
  The conventional finit element method calculated the 
properties of films incrementally. This required use of large 
computers. But the new system solves the problem through 
analysis of models based on strain control theory, calculations 
that can be done using personal computers. As a result, in 
addition to continuous solutions, all solutions of boundaries 
which had previously delayed thermal stress analysis of coating 
materials such as FGM, can be obtained. The finit element method 
provided only discontinuous solutions. 
  For now, Toshiba plans to use the newly developed system for 
designing severe environment resistant coating materials 
in-house in their energy-related research programs.

<F P=106> [Article by W. Mock: ``Japan Strives for Independence in </F>
Space''; Subhead: ``Rocket Development to Drive Technology, No 
Serious Competition for Europe's Ariane Booster Rocket in Short 
Term''] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 18 February 1994 -- Japan intends to 
use its new H-2 booster rocket to situate itself in the market 
for commercial rocket launches. But times are bad: the market is 
shrinking, the number of competitors is growing and it is 
difficult to realize a high frequency of launches in Japan. 
  With the successful launch of its H-2 rocket early this 
month, Japan finally managed to situate itself in one of the few 
markets where it is still scarcely represented: aerospace. 
  In the aviation sector Japanese firms are predominantly 
active as subcontractors for U.S. firms like Boeing and 
McDonnell Douglas as well as Europe's Airbus Industrie. In the 
space sector the Japanese have a small but relatively autonomous 
satellite development, but until early this year they were 
completely dependent in the case of booster rockets on U.S. 
licenses, above all, from McDonnell Douglas, Rocketdyne and 
Thiokol. The price that was paid for this was, for example, that 
the H-1, the precursor of the H-2, was not allowed to place any 
commercial satellites in earth orbit. 
  A year later than originally planned and after two major 
incidents that cost the life of one engineer, therefore, as 
Japan's Nikkei Weekly put it, with the H 2 ``a 260 t declaration 
of independence'' for Japan's aerospace industry was also 
launched. In the words of Hiroshi Harada, responsible for 
aerospace activities at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries: ``We 
developed the H-2 so we would have our own technology. Only 
after that will we be able to emerge as equal partners in 
international cooperative activities.'' 
  H-2 is supposed to be able to place an approximately four 
ton 
payload in the geostationary transfer orbit that is of interest 
particularly for communications satellites, and up to 10 t in 
near earth orbit, for example, for a space station at a distance 
of 400-500 km. 
  Under the leadership of Mitsubishi, Ishikawajima-Harima 
Heavy 
Industries, Nissan and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, nearly 70 
Japanese aerospace companies have combined in the Rocket Systems 
Corporation [RSC] to market the booster rockets. Commercial 
operation of the rocket is supposed to begin with the third 
launch of the H-2 this coming winter. 
  This will not be an easy task for the RSC. The 50 m long H-2 
is competing on the market with the Ariane 4 that is another 
five meters longer, with the U.S. Atlas and Delta rockets, 
Russia's Proton and China's Long March rocket. 
  Simultaneously, there is expected to be a perceptible 
decline 
in launch orders over the next few years. The reason is that in 
both the European and U.S. space programs, demand for new 
satellites is stagnant. 
  The Japanese are also coming up against a well-entrenched 
competition. In the past year, Arianespace, the European company 
operating the Ariane rocket, signed contracts for the launch of 
16 satellites. As reported by Arianespace, total competition 
from Atlas, Delta, Long March and Proton amounted to only five 
such launch contracts. Consequently, over the past year 
Arianespace was able to capture nearly 75 percent of the 
worldwide market for orders for the launching of civilian 
satellites. If only commercial satellites that were actually 
launched are counted, in 1993, Arianespace still had more than 
50 percent of the international market. That international 
market is estimated to be worth nearly DM2 billion annually. 
  Still, Ariane's supremacy is by no means as secure as its 
full orders books might suggest. The rocket-launch market is 
very temperamental and subject to major fluctuations. Hence, it 
was a big boost for Ariane when, in the mid 1980's, U.S. booster 
rockets and the Shuttle were forced into a string of failures. 
  On average, in recent years seven rockets per year have been 
launched from Kourou in French Guiana, often with two or more 
satellites on board. It was planned to increase the frequency of 
launches for 1994 to at least 10 launches. The goal is one 
launch per month. 
  This year's first launch, however, was a failure. About 
seven 
minutes after takeoff a fuel pump failed and Ariane 4's upper 
stage with Turkey's Turksat 1 communications satellite and the 
Eutelsat IIF5 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. 
  An analysis of the causes will take at least four weeks. 
Only 
then will the engineers proceed to prepare for the next launch. 
In the words of one observer: ``Two back-to-back failed launches 
like this one could noticeably knock the market out of kilter.'' 
  Charles Bigot, Arianespace's director, however, is confident 
that by the end of 1996 it will be possible to launch at least 
another 30 Ariane 4, if need be, even at an interval of only 
three weeks. The reason for the urgency is that Arianespace has 
a backlog of orders for 37 satellites worth nearly $3 billion. 
  Therefore, the H-2 is still far from being a real challenge 
to the Ariane. Launch prices are at least 50 percent more than 
the $120 million for an Ariane launch. What is more, the 
Japanese government has promised the country's fishers' unions 
that it will engage in launches only during a 45-day window in 
the summer and a comparable time period in the winter. 
Tanegashima, the H-2's launch site, is located at a distance of 
only 40 km from the coast of Kyushu, Japan's southernmost 
island. Given these conditions, it is hardly possible to have, 
at most, more than four launches per year. 
  According to an Institute for Economic Research [Ifo] study 
at yearend, what matters most for Japan, however, is that space 
is viewed as a key technology for the future. Therefore, as 
early as 1991, the government allocated nearly 2.2 billion, when 
converted, for promoting space activities. Public research 
facilities have requested an increase in funding for space 
research to more than DM6 billion for fiscal year 1994. But even 
here Japan's sorry economy has had an impact. Whereas in 1993 
R&amp;D outlays by industry and government still increased by 
nearly 
one percent, in the same time period funding for space declined 
by about 6.7 percent to a total of nearly DM3.3 billion.

  [Text] Director Takao Ishiwatari of the Power Reactor and 
Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation held a press conference on 
the 5 April after the prototype fast breeder reactor ``Monju'' 
(Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, 280,000kW power output) had 
reached criticality. During the press conference he disclosed 
that PNC had been looking into construction of a ``recycle 
experimental reactor'' that will strengthen Japan's 
non-proliferation measures in the hope of fending off increasing 
criticism against proliferation associated with 
plutonium-producing fast breeder reactors. 
  According to PNC officials, a mixture of plutonium and long 
half-life, hard-to-dispose transuranium (actinides) is extracted 
from spent nuclear fuel and burned as a fuel in the recycle 
research reactor which is a type of fast reactor. 
  Plutonium is thus handled in a state mixed with other 
substance, and therefore would be difficult to use for nuclear 
weapons. PNC intends to complete the nuclear fuel recycle within 
the nuclear power site by integrating the fast reactor and 
processing plant, so that nuclear materials will not have to 
leave the premise. 
  Director Ishiwatari enthusiastically discussed the actinides 
burnup/recycle research program, saying, ``The recycle system 
must be overhauled to measure up to non-proliferation 
expectations.'' The research on actinides recycling is expected 
to play a major role in the long-term plan for nuclear power 
development, the revision of which is near completion. 
  In regard to the technology for excess plutonium burnup 
using 
fast reactors, Director Ishiwatari also stated ``Monju is not 
suited to serve as a plutonium burner but is technically 
compatible.''

  [Text] Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo has developed a polymer 
electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) that uses platinum 
catalyst for electrodes. Compared to a conventional phosphoric 
acid fuel cell (PAFC), the maximum electrode output per square 
centimeter has been upgraded to 1.2 watts. This is approximately 
four times more than the maximum output generated by a 
conventional PAFC. Reaction efficiency between hydrogen and 
oxygen under room temperature has been improved by using high 
polymer membranes. The company has succeeded in running a 
commercially available motor scooter using the fuel cell as a 
mobile power supply. The company is still experimenting with 
extending the life of fuel cells and plans to conduct joint 
projects to put the development of this technology to practical 
use with battery manufacturers and automobile manufacturers. 
  The company miniaturized PEMFC and reduced its weight by 
applying a high polymer membrane, [naphion], to electrolyte 
layers in between several layers of cell electrode stacks from 
which power output is maximized. The amount of platinum used 
for the fuel cell is 1 milligram per square centimeter of the 
electrode. The fuel cell drives the motor using 1 liter of 
hydrogen per minute under atmospheric pressure. In principle, 
the fuel cell generates electricity resulting from reaction 
between the hydrogen gas and oxygen in the electrolytes between 
the catalyst layers and produces water. 
  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo jointly developed the basic 
technology 
with Professor Masahiro Watanabe of the Technology Department of 
Yamanashi University. The company solved a deterioration 
problem with catalyst poisoned by carbon monoxide in the 
hydrogen fuel by developing platinum catalyst to which hydrogen 
occlusion alloys are applied. Another deterioration problem 
with the catalyst's function from deterioration of excessive 
amounts of moisture needed for activating high polymer membranes 
was solved by replacing a portion of the moisture to 
electrolytes and then draining another part to achieve the 
appropriate levels of moisture. 
  The company installed the fuel cell in a 370-watt motor 
scooter. The company has completed 3000 hours of duration 
testing and started developing different types of fuel cells 
with reduced amounts of platinum as an experiment. The company 
predicts that the development will be commercially available for 
home-use mobile power supply and non-pollutant automobiles 
within two to three years. 
  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo also develops a variety of precision 
processing technologies for semiconductors and catalysts along 
with sales of metals. The company's technology development 
center in Kanagawa Prefecture has been developing catalyst 
electrodes for fuel cells such as PAFC and recently started 
expanding its development to fuel cells itself.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  The voice is a natural input system for humans, but a 
massive 
amount of computation is necessary for speech recognition. It 
has not been broadly applied because of problems such as the 
framework to integrate the voice input system with the existing 
interface not being established. Therefore, based on already 
developed high precision software speech recognition 
technology[.sup]1[/] applying high speed algorithms, the 
problems of integrating the voice input media with existing 
input systems was resolved by making the speech recognition 
function the server. 
  The newly developed software speech recognition interface 
and 
its applications are discussed here. 
<H5>  2. Speech Recognition in a Workstation </H5>
<H5>  2.1 Making a High Capacity Workstation </H5>
  Since speech recognition processing requires a massive 
amount 
of computation, hardware exclusively for speech recognition such 
as the prior digital signal processor (DSP) was necessary, but 
the authors used the computation capacity of current general 
workstations and developed a software speech recognition system 
operating in real time with high speed algorithms.[.sup]1[/] 
  This system performs high precision speech recognition 
responding to specific and non-specific speakers based on the 
composite analog method. Recently, other speech recognition 
systems with just software for specific speakers have been 
developed and an environment in which the speech recognition 
function can be used easily has been prepared. 
<H5>  2.2 Improvement of Human Interface by Voice Input </H5>
  Research on continuous speech recognition is being performed 
with the objectives of high precision text input by voice and 
dialogue with the computer, but the recognition capacity for 
continuous speech is at the level of evaluation in a laboratory 
environment and the recognition of isolated words is realistic 
when use in a real environment is considered. 
  Also, in order for voice input to be a standard input system 
like the keyboard or mouse, the actual method of the speech 
recognition interface is important along with the recognition 
capacity, but the framework to integrate voice input with 
existing interfaces is not established in the multimedia and 
multitasking environment which is generally used in workstations. 
  Xspeak[.sup]2[/] and CM-SLS (CMU Spoken Language 
Shell)[.sup]3[/] are being tried for the speech recognition 
interface with the assumption of multitasking. Xspeak can 
perform voice input to multitasking in the X-Window environment 
(X-Window is software developed at MIT.), but has the limitation 
that feedback of the internal state of the applied program to 
the recognition equipment is not possible. Also, since CM-SLS is 
an interface for use of continuous speech recognition equipment 
by means of a network, examination of real time processing and 
the form of use on a personal workstation is not sufficient. 
  The above points were considered, software speech 
recognition 
technology for which application expansion is easily designed 
was employed, multitasking was handled by making the speech 
recognition function a server, and improved quality of the human 
interface was designed. 
<H5>  3. Software Speech Recognition </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Software Speech Recognition by the Multiple Similarity </H5>
Method 
  Since the capacity of speech recognition greatly influences 
the usage state, this system emphasizes high precision with the 
subject being the recognition of isolated words which can 
guarantee high recognition capacity. 
  The function for recognizing single word speech consists of 
the acoustic processor and the multiple similarity operator as 
shown in Figure 1 (a). It uses the feature vectors attained by 
the acoustic processor, performs matching by multiple 
similarities with the recognition dictionary, and output the 
recognition results. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-06A>      Figure 1. Speech-recognition algorithm using the multiple similarity method. </FIG>

In the high speed algorithm (a), speed is 
increased by performing the frequency analysis having many 
operations only in the word intervals. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: (a) High speed recognition algorithm, 1. Acoustic 
processor, 2. Voice, 3. Beginning and ending point detection, 4. 
Resample frame determination, 5. Frequency analysis, 6. Word 
feature vector extraction, 7. Similarity operator, 8. Similarity 
operation, 9. Recognition dictionary, 10. Recognition results, 
(b) Prior recognition algorithm&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  In the acoustic processor, voice input is made at sampling 
frequency 8 kHz and quantization 8 bits with the telephone band 
CODEC (coding-decoding) contained in a general workstation. The 
beginning and ending points of words are detected by the time 
change of voice energy. Afterwards, it splits the word intervals 
into equal intervals, determines a sample point along the time 
axis, performs frequency analysis by a fast Fourier 
transformation (FFT), levels the frequency analysis results, for 
example it attains filter bank output, and outputs the time 
frequency pattern as the word feature vectors. Next, in the 
similarity operator, it calculates the multiple similarity of 
the word feature vector and the recognition dictionary shown in 
the following equation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-06B>      EQUATION </FIG>

  Here, S[.sup](i)[/][X] is the category 
i similarity value, X is the input word feature 
vector, M is the axis number, 
_l_[.sup](i)[/][.sub]m[/] and 
_l_[.sup](i)[/][.sub]1[/] are the proper values 
and _P_[.sup](i)[/][.sub]m[/] is the proper 
vector. The above _P_[.sup](i)[/][.sub]m[/] is 
found using K-L development from many patterns (word feature 
vector). The multiple similarity value of each word is found 
with the software and word recognition is performed. 
  The word recognition discussed above is distinguished by 
performing high precision recognition processing entirely with 
software and without using any external hardware. In the prior 
recognition algorithm according to the multiple similarity 
method in Figure 1 (b), convention required dedicated hardware 
such as DSP in order for voice analysis since frequency analysis 
was performed at all sample points (analysis frame) in the 
direction of time. Meanwhile, in the high speed algorithm, the 
amount of computations can be greatly reduced since analysis is 
performed for only the data resampled at regular intervals in 
the voice intervals detected at the beginning and ending points 
as shown in Figure 2. With this high speed algorithm, a speech 
recognition system with just software can operate in real time 
in a multitasking environment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-07A>      Figure 2. Extraction of a word feature vector. </FIG>

 The word interval is split into regular intervals, frequency analysis is 
made only at resample points set on the time axis, and the word 
feature vectors are extracted. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Power, 2. Threshold value, 3. Start point, 4. End 
point, 5. Time change of voice power, 6. Time, 7. Frequency, 8. 
BPF output, 9. Channel, 10. Dimension word feature 
vector&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3.2 Improvement of Recognition Capacity by Partial </H5>
Abstraction 
  Since the recognition of word units used in this system can 
express the entire and dynamic feature of a word by making a 
single pattern of the entire word, high recognition capacity is 
attained for the system in which the subject is a non-specific 
speaker under noisy conditions. Furthermore, it has the 
advantage that it can be applied to foreign languages as well 
just by changing the word dictionary. 
  Also, the word pattern is expressed as several word feature 
vectors with different dimension numbers from different 
viewpoints due to partial abstraction.[.sup](4)[/] For 
example, Figure 3 is the result of extracting several feature 
vectors of the word ``clear,'' Figure 3 (a) is the expression of 
the entire word, (b) is the detailed expression of the first 
half, and (c) is the detailed expression of the second half. 
With this partial abstraction, the verification of word voice 
from different viewpoints is performed based on the same 
multiple similarity; the recognition capacity can be improved by 
integrated processing since the trend of error recognition is 
generally different in each expression. In particular, the 
effect of partial abstraction can be anticipated in the case 
where word pairs in which part of the word inscription is the 
same are present in the recognition vocabulary. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-07B>      Figure 3. Example of frequency analysis and word feature vector. </FIG>

 The word pattern is illustrated by several feature 
vectors extracted from the different subject sections at 
different resolutions. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: (a) Total pattern (16x16 dimension), (b) First half 
pattern (12x32 dimension), (c) Second half pattern (12x32 
dimension), 1. Waveform (word = ``clear''), 2. FFT analysis 
results, 3. Word feature vector&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The capacity for non-specific speaker word recognition of 
this speech recognition equipment was 98.0% before partial 
abstraction and 99.2% after introduction in the case of a 
recognition subject vocabulary of 26 words necessary for DTP 
system operation. Especially in the case of using the entire 
pattern of the word, recognition errors were observed in the 
word pairs of ``grouping'' and ``group canceling'' or 
``grouping'' and ``smoothing.'' However, this was greatly 
improved with the introduction of partial abstraction. Here. the 
partial abstraction was performed using the pattern of the first 
and second halves of a 160 dimension word. 
<H5>  4. Mounting the Speech Recognition Interface </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Application of the Client-Server Model </H5>
  The method of interposing the speech recognition driver in 
Figure 4 (a) and the method of key emulation in which the speech 
recognition results are converted to key input in Figure 4 (b) 
are current speech recognition interfaces. Both of these methods 
do not presuppose usage in a multitasking environment and have 
the problem that changes to the vocabulary which can be input 
and changes of the internal state on the applied program side 
cannot be fed back into the recognition function. 
  The authors resolved these problems by making a server of 
the 
speech recognition function based on the client-server model 
shown in Figure 4 (c). This model separates tasks requiring 
processing (client) and tasks performing processing (server) and 
advances processing by performing communication between those. 
The advantage is that the several applied programs which are the 
client can have joint resources for speech recognition through 
the server and the several clients can use the speech 
recognition function. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-08A>      Figure 4. Configuration of speech recognition interface. </FIG>

The server type (c) can handle multitasking and performs minute 
processing by the reciprocal communication between client and 
server.

<H5>  4.2 Multimodal Correspondence Speech Recognition Server </H5>
  The trial speech recognition server was mounted on our 
company's workstation SPARC (SPARC is the registered trademark 
of SPARC International, Inc. in the US.) using the software 
speech recognition system discussed above. The speech 
recognition server usually operates as one process in the 
multitasking environment and makes notification of the 
recognition results and recognitions vocabulary by communication 
with the client. 
  Figure 5 shows an example of usage of the speech recognition 
server combined with a Window system. Windows A, B, and C are 
the clients of the speech recognition server and the voice focus 
designating client B as the transmission destination of the 
speech recognition results is assigned. For the voice input, the 
server uses the recognition vocabulary requested by client B, 
performs recognition processing, and transmits the results to 
client B. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-08B>      Figure 5. Speech recognition server on a workstation. </FIG>

Multimodal input can be effectively performed by establishing 
the voice focus and the keyboard focus separately. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Screen display, 2. Voice focus, 3. Keyboard 
focus, 4. Speech recognition dictionary, 5. Speech recognition 
server, 6. Acoustic input equipment, 7. Microphone&lt;/graphic&gt;; 

  The authors connected the two media of keyboard input and 
voice input to separate tasks and made possible the control of 
several applied programs at the same time through separate input 
channels. So that the user can distinguish the separate input 
tasks, a task which the user can input is displayed in the 
center of the screen as in Figure 5 for example. In this figure, 
the keyboard focus is expressed with the thickened window frame 
and the voice focus is expressed with the change of window title 
color. The voice focus is set with the mouse and voice (window 
name). Thus, multimodal input handling the voice, keyboard, and 
mouse at the same time can be effectively performed. 
  With the realization of speech recognition function by 
software only and the supposition of the speech recognition 
function following the server, the usage of standard speech 
recognition without depending on hardware became possible. Also, 
under a multi-window environment, voice input for several 
applied programs became possible. 
<H5>  5. Application of Speech Recognition Interface </H5>
  Several application programs have been tried as clients with 
the objective of evaluating the speech recognition server. Of 
those, the application to the DTP system is discussed as an 
example. The DTP system has a screen as in Figure 6 (a) and 
performs editing of text and images. The DTP control is 
performed by converting and transmitting the speech recognition 
results to keyboard commands with the control program shown in 
Figure 6 (b). 
  Keyboard commands use the API (Application Program 
Interface) 
provided by the DTP system. The recognition vocabulary uses the 
menu tier of the DTP system and is limited and the recognition 
capacity can remain high. The route of the menu tier is called 
the ``top level;'' words from the top level are spoken and the 
commands are executed by going through the menu. At each 
movement in the menu tier, the menu item in the window and the 
current position in the menu tier are expressed in the form of a 
path and presented to the user. 
  The operation target is selected with the mouse and the 
operations such as ``cut,'' ``paste,'' and ``up/down reverse'' 
for the target are performed by voice. Since these two media can 
share roles in a natural form, complex mouse operations during 
text editing and figure editing are reduced and an interface 
with good usage conditions can be realized. 
<H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>
  A standard speech recognition interface for a workstation 
multimedia/multitasking environment was developed. This speech 
recognition interface can handle multimodal input including 
keyboard, mouse, and voice input by making a server of the 
speech recognition function. Also, with the high precision 
software speech recognition technology performing processing in 
real time, a wide range of applications which do not rely on 
hardware are possible. In the future, research is planned with 
the objective of establishing a human interface with better 
usage conditions and using voice media.

<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  In recent years, the dissemination of CAD systems in design 
sites is remarkable. However, many hand-drawn sketches still 
remain in design sites. Therefore there is a need for input and 
editing of hand-drawn sketches. 
  The image vector integrated image editing system 
VECTIMATM is a system developed to satisfy this type 
of need and it is characterized by performing image editing and 
CAD data editing at the same time without changing the screen. 
  Here, the operating method is introduced with an emphasis on 
the user and machine interface of the VECTIMATM. 
<H5>  2. Outline of the VECTIMATM System </H5>
  VECTIMATM operates on the engineering workstation 
AS4000 series of this company and is a system which can edit and 
display image data and vector data at the same time. This system 
is composed of drawing input, drawing editing, drawing output, 
and external interface sections, as broadly classified. Each of 
those functions is executed from a window. 
  Figure 1 shows the functional structure of the 
VECTIMATM. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-09A>      Figure 1. Functional configuration of VECTIMATM. </FIG>

 It is composed of drawing input, drawing 
editing, drawing output, and external interface.

  The raster vector conversion (RVC) function developed as HI 
to rapidly effect the tracing operation performed by the human 
system and the operation of the on-screen tablet designed for 
unification of the keyboard operation are introduced here. 
<H5>  3. RVC operation </H5>
  The RVC function in the VECTIMATM uses the 
dialogue type from past experience. This function automatically 
vectorizes the designated zones and can perform vectorization 
without waste by performing restorative processing of incorrect 
spots due to paper quality at human discretion. Figure 2 shows 
the flow of the RVC processing function. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-10A>      Figure 2. Flow of RVC function. </FIG>

 This is in the order of parameter setting, zone designation, batch 
processing-confirmatory registration, or dialogue processing, 
zone designation completion, and vector restoration successively. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Parameter setting, 2. Zone designation, 3. Batch 
processing, 4. Dialogue processing, 5. Confirmatory 
registration, 6. Zone designation completion, 7. Vector 
restoration.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  RVC processing consists of parameter setting, initial 
processing, batch conversion processing, dialogue designation 
processing, registration processing, RVC zone release 
processing, and vector restorative processing. An outline of 
each of those functions is shown below. 
<H5>  3.1 Parameter setting </H5>
  This is the function to determine parameter values in zone 
designation-conversion processing inside the designated zone 
before performing zone designation and conversion processing. 
  The two types of parameters are preprocessing and detection 
processing and both influence each process. Also, by filing the 
parameters, it is possible to retain the parameters of each 
drawing. The default values are executed when preprocessing is 
executed without setting parameters. 
  Figure 3 shows the setting of parameters within the system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-10B>          Figure 3. Parameters set by RVC function. </FIG>

 The parameter values are set for preprocessing and detection processing and 
are useful for preparing the parameter files. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. RVC processing, 2. Parameter setting, 3. 
Preprocessing, 4. Detection processing, 5. Change, 6. Load/save, 
7. Parameter values, 8. Parameter files, 9. Data flow, 10. 
Operation 

<H5>  3.2 Zone designation processing </H5>
  This function performs preprocessing for the designated 
short 
form zone. The preprocessing for vectorization executes the run 
image conversion function, connected diagram detection function, 
line-thinning processing function, contour dashed line 
approximation function, and fine line dashed line approximation 
function, however, these are batched and executed inside the 
computer where the user cannot see. 
  The user designates the short form zone by locating two 
points (designation of arbitrary points in the diagram) and the 
red frame indicates the designated area. The processing area can 
have several designations, a maximum of four places and layering 
is also possible. Also, the entire drawing can be made the 
designated zone. 
  Figure 4 shows the zone designation drawing. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11A>      Figure 4. Setting range. </FIG>

 The processing area can have up to four points designated, layering is also possible. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Drawing, 2. Zone&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3.3 Batch conversion processing </H5>
  This function performs the detection of circles, line 
segments, broken lines, and lines of text in a batch and 
prepares the diagram data for the zone designated with 
preprocessing. 
  3.3.1 Detection processing. The user locates which zone 
designed with the initial processing is the subject and 
designates the detection of any or all circles, line segments 
and broken lines, or lines of text inside the located zone. 
  3.3.2 Registration processing. The data extracted by 
detection processing is displayed in order on the screen; the 
data detected unnecessarily is eliminated and finally it is 
batched and registration is performed. Figure 5 shows the 
registration screen. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11B>      Figure 5. Window for vector data registration. </FIG>

 Vector data registration is performed with the ``next site,'' ``delete,'' 
``previous site,'' ``batch registration,'' and ``complete'' 
buttons. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Vector registration, 2. Next site, 3. Delete, 4. 
Previous site, 5. Batch registration, 6. Complete, 7. Element: 
circle, 8. Current position.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  3.4 Dialogue designation processing </H5>
  This is the function which performs the detection of 
circles, 
arcs, line segments, and lines of text by locating the images 
and their periphery which the user wants to detect inside the 
zone designated in preprocessing. 
  During the detection of circles, arcs, and line segments, 
each of the images is designated. During the detection of lines 
of text, the periphery of the text image is designated. 
<H5>  3.5 Zone Completion </H5>
  The designated zone is released. 
<H5>  3.6 Vector restoration </H5>
  Since the vector data prepared as the result of RVC 
processing is faithfully converted in the image, distortion 
appears in many cases. Therefore, various vector restoration 
functions are provided in VECTIMATM. Figure 6 shows 
an example of restoration. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-11C>      Figure 6. Plastic vector data. </FIG>

 This shows the results of the restoration operation for the incorrect vectors detected 
with RVC processing. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: (a) Element arrangement, (b) Line segment 
conversion, (c) Circle conversion, (d) Line segment 
horizontal/vertical&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  A number of these are introduced here. 
  (1) Element arrangement: The designated diagram is arranged 
in a standard diagram. 
  (2) Line segment conversion: Several line segments and 
broken 
lines are made a single line segment. 
  (3) Circle conversion: Several arcs are made one circle. 
  (4) Line segment horizontal/vertical: Line segments are 
corrected to the horizontal or vertical. 
<H5>  4. On-screen tablet operation </H5>
  Prior CAD systems usually had the system where a menu sheet 
was affixed to the tablet board and commands were selected. 
However, this system resulted in wasteful human motions. 
  Therefore, VECTIMATM has a command menu which the 
user can arbitrarily prepare called the on-screen tablet 
displayed on the screen and selection by the mouse is possible. 
  Frequently used commands and macros may be collected on a 
single menu and put in an easily used form. 
  Figure 7 shows an example of the on-screen tablet. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-12A>      Figure 7. Example of on-screen tablet. </FIG>

 An easily used MMI is provided with the on-screen tablet which the user can 
arbitrarily establish.

Rounding, 6. Text, 7. Dimensions, 8. Move, 9. Standard line, 10. 
Trim, 11. Spot removal, 12. Copy, 13. Dimensional line, 14. 
Text, 15. Balloon, 16. Image, 17. Trace.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  The MMI introduced here was developed using the SunOS window 
system (SunOS is a trademark of the US Sun Microsystems 
Company). In the future, Open Look and Motif (Open Look is the 
GUI advocated by UNIX International and Motif is the GUI 
advocated by the Open Software Federation (OSF)) will be 
examined for a graphical user interface and then the human 
interface with the user will be strengthened.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  With the increase in computer applications concerned with 
three- dimensions, the necessity for a three-dimensional HI is 
increasing more and more. For example, in many three-dimensional 
CAD, though the functions of modeling and form presentation are 
becoming complete, there are many commands and input items and 
the operation is complicated. These problems will be resolved if 
the technology to display the form as a three-dimensional image 
and to operate as is thought is established. Also, the results 
of three-dimensional physical simulation are visualized and the 
use of three-dimensional images becomes more effective in the 
case of constructing and displaying three-dimensional images for 
medical use from ultrasonic diagnostic equipment and CT 
(Computed Tomography) equipment as well. 
  In order to realize such a three-dimensional HI, a display 
is 
necessary which not only displays the three-dimensional data 
simply, but also gives the sense as an object in the real world 
to the user. Visually, the sense of an object is produced by the 
user actively changing the viewpoint. For example, when we see 
an actual object, we change our viewpoint and look at it from 
various directions. In other words, for the perception of the 
three-dimensional form accurately, the change in the way of 
seeing following the change in viewpoint is used in addition to 
the stereoscopic perception from both eyes. 
  In current virtual reality (VR), such a sense is 
artificially 
formed with the change in the display according to the movements 
of the head. However, since there is always a time lag between 
the head movements and the change in the display with this 
method, the user easily gets motion sickness.[.sup]1[/] Also, 
in order for the measurement of the head movements, it is 
necessary to wear a device in the form of special goggles which 
is inconvenient in practical application. 
  For the display of data as a three-dimensional object in a 
more natural form, it is most simple to display it as a three- 
dimensional image in real space. At Toshiba, a display for this 
type of display system which uses the afterimage of the eye was 
developed.[.sup]2[/] Called the volumetric scanning system, 
this display has the following characteristics which are not 
found in other display systems; it is thought to be appropriate 
for various fields. 
  1. A natural three-dimensional sense is attained in order 
for 
the image to unite completely with real space. 
  2. The field of vision is very wide and the image can be 
viewed by many people around the display. 
  3. Volume data can be directly displayed. 
  Below, an outline of the display and examples of its 
applications are discussed from the perceptive of HI. 
<H5>  2. Outline of the display </H5>
  Figure 1 shows the principle for the volumetric scanning 
display developed. While the panel of LED arranged in a matrix 
form is moved up and down, sectional images of the object 
corresponding to the position of the panel are displayed. When 
the LED panel moves at high speeds, each image appears connected 
with the effect of the afterimage in the eye and this is 
perceived as a three-dimensional image. In other words, the 
effect attained by moving the two-dimensional display surface is 
the same as if picture elements were positioned in real space. 
Moreover, the round trip movement of the LED panel is produced 
by mechanical conversion of the rotary movement of a motor. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-13A>      Figure 1. Principle of three-dimensional array. </FIG>

 The three-dimensional image is made by the display of cross 
sectional images corresponding to the position of the LED panel 
which is moving up and down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The two technical points here are as follows. 
  1. Display of clear image. The brightness of the image is 
determined by the illumination time per unit time and the 
properties of the LED. Here, as the display is made twice in one 
round trip of the LED panel, the illumination time of each LED 
is operated by the parallelization of the display processing. 
Also, red high brightness type elements with high emission 
strength and fast response are used as the LED. 
  2. Homogenization of image brightness. Since the speed of 
the 
LED panel is fast in the center of the display zone and slow at 
the ends, the LED illumination density and time may be made 
independent of the panel speed in order to homogenize the 
brightness of the image. Here, while the initial display 
position of each cross section is made at regular intervals with 
the linear encoder, all the LEDs are controlled to illuminate at 
a time with the standard being the maximum speed time of the 
panel. 
  Moreover, so a moving picture can be displayed, an AS4000 
series workstation is used for the computer and an S bus is used 
for data transmission from the computer to the display memory. 
Also, the display memory has a 2 bank configuration and isolates 
and performs the writing of data from the computer and the 
reading of data to the display section. 
  Meanwhile, in this display, since the image is expressed as 
an assemblage of monochromatic bright points, the expression of 
shading is not possible. Also, the processing of hidden surface 
is not possible since all the cross sections are seen in 
principle. Consequently, when it is displayed as a solid and its 
interior is filled with bright points, the edges become 
indefinite and only individual lumps of light can be seen. Also, 
the image of the rear which originally could not be seen appears 
transparent. Therefore, in the case of displaying a solid form, 
only the surface or edge of the form becomes filled with bright 
points. 
<H5>  3. Applications of Display </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Display of Form and Operation </H5>
  The following two issues are considered in direct 
three-dimensional form modeling. 
  1. The method to indicate points in space and link these 
with 
a line 
  2. The method according to a combination of the basic form 
  For the first method, an HI pointing to an image of points 
and lines directly is desirable. However, in this display, since 
the image is displayed in space where an LED panel is moving, it 
cannot be directly pointed out. Therefore, with the prototype 
system as shown in Figure 4, the image on the display is 
transferred in three dimensions to another space with an optical 
system using a concave mirror and the transferred image is 
operated with a pointer. In this case, direct pointing is 
performed easily since the transferred image is also a 
three-dimensional real image. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-15A>      Figure 4. Image transfer using optical system. </FIG>

 By using an optical system employing a concave mirror, the image on the 
display is transferred to a space where it can be freely 
operated. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Volume scanning display, 2. Image before 
transfer, 3. Concave mirror, 4. Image after transfer, 5. 
Three-dimensional pointer, 6. Viewpoint&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  On the other hand, for the second method, an HI in which the 
desired form is prepared while the combination among forms is 
confirmed is desirable. Therefore, it is necessary for the set 
operations among the forms to be performed and displayed in real 
time. Here, this HI is realized as the form is developed in the 
form of volume data in the computer memory and this display is 
used to display the results of the set operations. The set 
operations in the memory are at a high speed for the quantity of 
data to the extent of this display; moreover the volume data can 
be directly displayed with this display. Consequently, while the 
form is moved with a three-dimensional mouse, the state of this 
combination can be seen as a three-dimensional real image in 
real time. Figure 5 shows an example of a mechanical part 
produced with this method. This can be precisely called the 
ultimate three-dimensional CAD environment which directly 
prepares a three-dimensional form in real space. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-15A>      Figure 5. Mechanical part modeled by set operations. </FIG>

 An example of a three-dimensional form (mechanical part) made 
directly in real space. 

<H5>  3.2 Visualization of simulation results </H5>
  The results of three-dimensional simulations usually are 
shown as spatially distributed numerical data, in other words 
volume data. In the case of visualizing this using prior CRT 
(Image display equipment), it is necessary to project all data 
in two dimensions in theory and the display processing is 
difficult. On the other hand, with this display, processing such 
as two-dimensional projection is unnecessary since the points in 
three-dimensional space correspond directly to the display 
memory as discussed above. The volume data can be directly 
visualized. Also, since the image can really be observed from 
various directions, it is easy to understand such data with a 
high degree of geometrical abstraction. 
  Figure 6 shows air flow simulation results of an air 
conditioner in a heated room. The outer frame of the diagram 
shows the room, the small rectangle inside is the air 
conditioner, the box on the floor is an obstruction and the 
points are the tracers to express the flow. The position at each 
time of each tracer is calculated from the speed vector in 
advance and put in the form of volume data. As this volume data 
is continuously transmitted and displayed to the display, the 
simulation results can e displayed as a moving image. 
Furthermore, the understanding of the phenomena is increased 
since it is possible to change the display speed or stop at or 
return to a point which one wants to observe. 
  Moreover, tracers are displayed in this example, but it 
works 
the same in the case of showing equivalent surfaces or boundary 
surfaces. 
<H5>  3.3 Display of three-dimensional images for medical use and </H5>
operation 
  Three-dimensional images for medical use are basically made 
by accumulating continuous sectional layered images from X-ray 
CT equipment and ultrasonic diagnostic equipment. In other 
words, this is volume data and can be directly displayed as a 
three-dimensional image if this display is used in the same way 
as in the previous section. Here, bones and organs are brought 
out and isolated with the key of differences from previous CT 
values; the system to combine them as necessary at the display 
time was constructed.[.sup]3[/] Figure 7 is a display example 
of a three-dimensional CT image of the head; the form and 
position of the afflicted section can be clearly seen.

Bones and organs are brought out and isolated with previous CT 
values; they are combined and displayed as necessary.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Moreover, support for surgical planning and surgical 
simulation as in Figure 8 become possible by developing the 
image on a computer and performing layering, removal, and 
transfer as set operations in memory in real time. Figure 9 
shows an example of layering the afflicted section and 
hypothetical sphere in real time and measuring its size and 
central position. The precision of actual surgery is expected to 
be improved with this.

Information from each type of diagnostic equipment and the database is integrated 
and analyzed, the three- dimensional images of bones and organs 
are displayed, and surgical simulation is performed.

general dimensions, volume, and central position are found, and 
surgical planning is supported.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  A volumetric scanning three-dimensional display using an 
LED, 
the preparation and display of its form, and its application to 
the visualization of flow analysis results and the display and 
operation of three-dimensional images for medical use were 
discussed. 
  In the future, we would like for it to be appropriate for 
various areas when the display is made multicolored.

  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  In the planning and design process for industrial products 
and interior space, mock-ups and small models were prepared and 
the situation of their use and the problems when used were 
examined. 
  With the advances in computers in recent years, CG has been 
introduced and has been used for presentations to clients. In 
this field, a graphic image is primary and an image prepared by 
CG is recorded frame by frame, and an image for the presentation 
is prepared. 
  On the other hand, virtual reality technology (also called 
VR: virtual reality, AR: artificial reality, or VE: virtual 
environment) effecting the sense that one is in a 
computer-generated world has been gathering 
attention.[.sup]1[/] VR has been applied in fields such as 
virtual surgery, education, and entertainment, and attempts for 
application in the design process are being made.[.sup]2,3[/] 
In VR, since interaction is important, the data used is very 
simple. Therefore, the problem is that the image quality 
attained is not sufficient for actually performing design review 
with the customer. 
  Discussed here is a virtual prototyping system[.sup]5[/] 
which performs interactive instrument layout, using a high speed 
display algorithm[.sup]4[/] which can maintain high image 
quality and also effect interaction. The virtual prototyping 
system uses three-dimensional CAD data and can also make various 
arrangements; it has also made a prototype for a central 
operations room of a power plant. The example introduced here is 
of application to the new and old CT scanning (computer layer 
imaging equipment) room at the Toshiba Hospital. 
<H5>  2. Virtual prototyping system </H5>
  The virtual prototyping system has the following 
characteristics. 
  1. High quality display using three-dimensional CAD data 
  2. High speed display due to simplified layering 
  3. Interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement 
  4. Restrictions concerning material arrangement in the 
three-dimensional space 
  These characteristics are explained below. 
<H5>  2.1 High quality display </H5>
  In order to support interaction, the three-dimensional CG 
model used in traditional VR is extremely simplified to several 
hundred polygons (Three-dimensional CG model data is often 
displayed as a collection of polygons when drawn, the number of 
those polygons shows the complexity of the model). The model 
used in usual CG (when taken frame by frame, it can be seen as 
animation) has several tens of polygons, but models having 
several hundred polygons are used in VR in order to increase 
drawing speed. Therefore, image quality is poor and the sense of 
reality is lost. 
  In this virtual system, three-dimensional CAD data is used 
as 
is in order to compensate for the lack of this sense of reality. 
The dxf format data which is becoming the industrial standard is 
converted to a form which can be handled in the graphic library 
(GL) on the SGI graphics workstation (GWS). As a result, the 
high image quality display can be attained as VR as shown in the 
frontispiece. In order to increase the sense of presence, an 
actual output image is on the monitor screen of the console 
(texture mapping) and interior shadows are also made. 
  Figure 1 shows the subject of the new and old CT scanning 
rooms in Toshiba Hospital. The console and the CT were prepared 
with three-dimensional CAD based on the designs. The desk and 
chair used were already input from prior prototypes. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-17A>      Figure 1. Old and new CT scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. </FIG>

 CT prepared with three-dimensional CAD were arranged 
in the new and old scanning rooms in Toshiba Hospital. (a) Old 
scanning room, (b) New scanning room&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  The three-dimensional CAD data run on GWS just indicates the 
arrangement on the arrangement editor and has the advantage that 
a scanning room as in Figure 1 can be constructed even without 
special knowledge of CG since the three-dimensional space as in 
Figure 1 can be attained. 
<H5>  2.2 High Speed Display </H5>
  If a model of ten times the complexity is to be drawn, the 
drawing time increases ten times. In order to resolve this 
issue, speed is increased by simplified layering.[.sup]4[/] 
  Simplified layering uses the fact that the discrimination of 
fine sections is lessened since the on-screen surface area of 
objects far from the point of view becomes small. In effect, the 
image quality is retained as the far objects are simplified and 
the near objects are displayed with more precision. This 
simplification is performed automatically or selectively. 
<H5>  2.3 Interactive Viewpoint Indication and Arrangement </H5>
  When three-dimensional CAD data is run, one can see from 
various points of view (walk through) inside the virtual space 
of the scanning room displayed with high image quality by 
simplified layering. Concretely, one can interactively indicate 
the position from which to see using an input device such as the 
VPL Co. DataGlove[.sup]TM[/]. Figure 1 shows a view from 
almost directly above. On the other hand, by designating the 
point of view seen from when the radiologist is working, it can 
be confirmed whether the radiologist can verify the condition of 
the patient. Also, not just seeing, but interactively changing 
the arrangement of the instruments is possible. The operation of 
the arrangement change is easiest when performed from a bird's 
eye view (seen from directly above) so that the entire space can 
be viewed. 
  With this virtual system as above, the place can be seen 
from 
various perspectives and the conditions of use can be examined 
at the clients' request during design review. Furthermore, since 
the arrangement of the place can be changed if inconvenient and 
the results can be verified on the spot, the efficiency of the 
design process can be greatly improved. 
<H5>  2.4 Restrictions Concerning the Arrangement of Objects in </H5>
Three-Dimensional space 
  With just the simple transfer of objects, they interfere 
(sinking in together) and desks and tables float in space since 
three-dimensional CG data are without substance and the physical 
laws do not operate. Arrangement with care so that this does not 
happen in three-dimensional space is rather difficult. However, 
when interference checks are correctly performed and physical 
laws are calculated in order to resolve this, the calculation 
load is high and interaction cannot be supported. 
  With this virtual prototyping system, the interference check 
is just performed for the bottom surface of objects in order to 
perform interference checks with a low calculation load. Also, 
in order to prevent things floating in midair, discrimination 
between interior and exterior is performed when the objects are 
arranged. Thus, desks and tables are on the floor and laptop 
personal computers are on the desks. Since the restrictions are 
satisfied on the spot, the arrangement can easily be changed 
while interaction is maintained. 
<H5>  3. Test case applied to Toshiba Hospital </H5>
  Renewal is necessary following the technical advance of 
medical instruments like CT. There are cases of newly making 
scanning rooms as well as using the original scanning rooms. In 
either case, customers with different perspectives such as 
doctors, radiologists, and nurses work in the scanning room. In 
order to design a scanning room with good conditions for use, it 
is necessary to reflect the voices of these clients, but 
presently, they are busy with their daily duties and cannot take 
time. Furthermore, the patients are the most important clients, 
but since they have health problems, they generally don't want 
to contribute to the design. 
  The virtual prototyping system was applied to the new and 
old 
CT scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital as a test case to clarify 
such problems. Figure 1 and the frontispiece show the output. 
The CG models of the CT and consoles are the same in the new and 
old scanning rooms. In the old scanning room, the CT was 
arranged at right angles to the console because of the 
relationship between the exit and the size of the room. 
Therefore, when the radiologist was interviewed, it was 
indicated that it is difficult to see the patient when operating 
the console. On the other hand, since the room is large, the new 
scanning room has the CT placed at an angle so that the entire 
body of the patient can be verified (frontispiece). 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  A virtual prototyping system which can be used in design 
review was realized with high image quality, high display speed, 
interactive viewpoint indication and arrangement, and physical 
restrictions to arrangement. With this, the problems can be 
evaluated and corrected on the spot while the clients and 
technicians directly view the same information. This system was 
applied to the scanning rooms at Toshiba Hospital. 
  In the future, virtual prototyping technology will be 
introduced with simulation applied to problems like the 
reflected simulation of a ceiling light developed separately and 
be applied to various types of examples. At the same time, we 
would like to establish it as evaluation technology[.sup]6[/] 
including work in real space.

  [Text] Sharp developed technology for oscillation with a 
high-output semiconductor laser which emits 680 nanometer red 
light. By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window, 
to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the 
world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat 
generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal 
absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the 
reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical 
discs. Sharp will continue to prevent the deterioration of 
interior elements and such and also plans to apply this 
technology to short wavelength lasers, which are suitable for 
high density recording. 
  The most distinguishing feature of the newly developed laser 
is the window which was grown by the MOCVD [metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition] method on a laser element composed of 
aluminum, gallium, indium, and phosphorus. The window has a 
composition similar to that of the laser element. Because it is 
possible to control the light absorption at the end surface, it 
is possible for the laser to have a long life span. When 50 
milliwatt lasers were compared, the one with the window was able 
to extend its lifetime by more than 10 times that of the one 
without the window. 
  When a semiconductor laser's output is increased, the laser 
element's end surface absorbs light, heat is generated, and the 
crystal structure breaks down. Up until now, the optical output 
for a red laser came to a halt at 200 milliwatts. 
  The red semiconductor laser is used for compact disc [CD] 
reading and for minidisc [MD] reading and writing. A 700 
nanometer type with an output from 30-50 milliwatts has been put 
to practical use. The volume of information, which includes 
imagery and voice and such, increases the need for the 
commercialization of shortwave lasers that can record with 
higher speed and more density. The company intends to apply this 
element design to short wavelength lasers with high output.

  0.25 m Electron-Beam Direct Writing Technology. Naoaki 
Aizaki, Ken Nakajima, Satomi Hirasawa, and Yoshikatsu Kojima, pp 
4-9 
  An 0.25 m electron-beam direct writing technology has 
been 
developed for 256 M bit DRAM test fabrication. The following 
three key techniques have been improved and optimized: 
  (1) a pattern data preparation technique for correcting 
proximity effect and reducing data conversion time; 
  (2) a resist process technique for fabricating reliable fine 
patterns; 
  (3) an electron-beam writing system technique for improving 
overlay accuracy. 
  The overlay accuracy was improved to under 0.075 m 
(average + 3 _s_), which is sufficient for the required 
alignment tolerance. Utilizing these techniques, a 256 M bit 
DRAM in a feature size of 0.25 m was successfully 
fabricated. 
  3.3 V Single Power-Supply 64 M Bit Flash Memory. Toshio 
Takeshima, Hiroshi Sugawara, Hiroshi Takada, Yoshiaki Hisamune, 
Kohji Kanamori, Takeshi Okazawa, Tatsunori Murotani, and Isao 
Sasaki, pp 10-14 
  A 3.3 V single power-supply 64 M bit flash memory has been 
developed by using 0.4 m CMOS technology. 50 ns access time 
and 256 bit erase/programming unit-capacity have been achieved 
by using hierarchical word-line and bit-line structure. Dynamic 
Bit-line Latch (DBL) programming scheme, which enables 256 bit 
simultaneous programming, has been developed. The chip measures 
19.3mm by 13.3mm. 
  Development of the Low Cost and High Voltage CMOS Process. 
Ken'ichiro Takahashi, Kousuke Yoshida, and Hideaki Horii, pp 
15-18 
  EL (ElectroLuminescence) display, VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent 
Displays) and PDP (Plasma Display Panel) need a high operating 
voltage of more than 100 V. The junction isolating technology 
has been usually used for the EL, VFD and PDP drivers. However, 
the junction-isolating structure requires more process steps 
than self-isolating structure, such as buried layer formation, 
epitaxial layer growth, and isolating layer formation. 
Accordingly, the junction-isolating type IC is more expensive 
than the self-isolating type. NEC has developed the 
manufacturing process of self-isolating type for the EL, VFD and 
PDP driver ICs. The maximum rating voltage of this process is 
150 V. Until NEC develops the process, NEC's maximum voltage of 
self-isolating type ICs was 80 V. From now on, most EL, VFD and 
PDP driver ICs will be supplied with inexpensive self-isolating 
technology. 
  500 MHz 32-Bit CMOS RISC Process. Hachiro Yamada, Yoichi 
Yano, and Isami Sakai, pp 19-25 
  NEC has developed a 500 MHz, 32-bit RISC microprocessor LSI 
using triple-level aluminum 0.4 m CMOS technology. Its 
32-bit 
data-path is designed with 8-stage pipeline architecture, which 
includes 2-stage 1 KB cache memories, 2-stage adders and a 
2-stage barrel shifter. NEC has also developed several key 
technologies for high-speed LSIs, such as a level-short clock 
tree circuit, a low noise high-speed interface circuit, a 
low-bounce stacked power line, a high-density standard cell 
method, and a 500 MHz low jitter PLL circuit. About 200,000 
transistors are integrated into a die area of 7.90mm x 8.84mm. 
The power dissipation is 6 W at a 3.3 V power supply and 500 MHz 
operating frequency. 
  Multi Chip Module for the RISC Microprocessor. Mikio Baba, 
Teruhiko Konno, Yuichi Yoshida, Tsuneo Koike, Yumi Yoshida, 
Takahiro Fukui, and Ichiro Yoshida, pp 26-30 
  Needs for Multi Chip Module (MCM) are rapidly increasing, as 
electronic products are required to have size-reduction and 
high-performance. NEC has developed MCM technologies based on 
single-chip packages. This paper describes the technologies of 
the MCM containing a RISC microprocessor and cache memories in a 
conventional package. 
  Miniaturized LCC Type Hybrid IC With Chip Capacitor and 
Resistor Components. Masao Ushigome, Osamu Ohnishi, Yoshifumi 
Moriyama, Futoshi Hosoya, and Yoshihito Kataoka, pp 31-33 
  LCC (Leadless Chip Carrier) type hybrid IC is a package 
which 
is established by joining COB (Chip On Board) assembling 
technology and manufacturing technology of epoxy-glass printed 
wiring boards. To meet requirements for high-frequency and 
high-performance, NEC has developed a new type of LCC package. 
This paper describes the new LCC type hybrid IC which contains 
chip capacitor and resistor components. 
  Development of Ultra Fine Pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFP. 
Takayuki Uno, Masato Aiba, Satoshi Takahashi, and Yasuhiro 
Suzuki, pp 34-37 
  NEC has developed ultra fine pitch (0.4, 0.3mm pitch) QFPs 
to 
satisfy the requirements of size-reduction and high-performance 
of electronics. This paper discusses the ultra high pin count 
QFP for higher density and performance LSI devices. These QFPs 
have been developed by realizing new technologies: the design 
method using simulation, and the package structure using TAB 
tape. As a result, NEC has developed 376 pin QFP (0.4 mm pitch, 
[square] 40 mm, 3.2 mm[.sup]t[/]) and 504 pin LQFP 
(Low-profile QFP, 0.3mm pitch, [square] 40 mm, 
1.4mm[.sup]t[/]). 
  Development of On-Line System for Wafer Sort Process. Haruo 
Amano, Tetsunori Maeda, Yuji Miyagi, Michio Honma, Toshihiko 
Kikuchi, Yoshihiro Miyajima, Masahide Ozawa, Kenichi Nagatome, 
Mamoru Maki, and Shigeo Fujino, pp 38-42 
  As wafer sort process becomes multiple processes, such 
improvements as the reduction of mis-operation, the achievement 
of high efficiency in operation, and higher accuracy in test 
data collection have been required. For these improvements, NEC 
has developed a wafer sort on-line system as NEC's standard 
system. The system, called WITS, has been installed in Roseville 
plant of NEC Electronics Inc. (U.S.A.). In the WITS system, all 
the test and sort equipment are controlled through Ethernet by 
the line control system, which is connected to the production 
control system and transacts data with each other. Regarding 
operation, the worker's job is only to input the LOT-ID barcode. 
Receiving the data, the system can set the testing parameter 
automatically, and testing can start easily. As a result, 
mis-operation and pre-operation time can be greatly reduced, and 
low yield trend or causes can be detected early. This wafer sort 
on-line system has increased production efficiency, and is 
currently operating well. 
  Acquisition of ISO9000 Certification in NEC Semiconductor 
Group. Tsutomu Igarashi, Teruo Muroya, Teruo Hidaka, Mineki 
Fukumoto, and Takenori Kanasaki, pp 43-48 
  ISO9000 quality assurance system was enacted in 1987 and 
more 
than 50 countries have already implemented it. In Japan, it was 
implemented as Japan Industrial Standard (JIS), and in 1993 the 
Japan Accreditation Board Quality System Registration (JAB) was 
established. Under these status, as for all NEC semiconductor 
business unit in Japan, divisions with design functions have 
been qualified for the ISO9001 and subsidiary companies with 
manufacturing functions have also been qualified for the 
ISO9002. In the acquisition period, we specified the job area 
promoted in terms of both the whole group and each unit, then we 
encouraged assigned members. This paper describes troubleness, 
usefulness or effectiveness by examples from the divisions and 
subsidiaries.

Miyazawa, 
Yoichi Shikata, Tomihiro Ishihara, Tohru Kamisaki, Hiroshi 
Yamamoto, Akio Tanaka, Hiromi Yokoyama, Syuji Suzuki, and Seiji 
Miyamoto, pp 55-60 
  NEC uses a variety of methods to provide technical 
information on semiconductors both inside and outside the 
company. Among a large amount of information, product 
information is provided as printed material, including data 
sheets, user's manuals, and regular publications. However, due 
to the quick technical innovations in the field of 
semiconductors, the volume of information is rapidly increasing, 
and information is greatly varying. There has thus arisen the 
need on a computer-based retrieval system for efficiently 
retrieved specific information from a mass of information 
available. This paper describes the technical information 
support system, especially NESDIS (NEC Semiconductor Device 
Information System), and also gives an outline of the future 
trend in information services.

Microprocessor. Kaoru Uchida, Kazunaga Yoshida, Keiji Yamada, 
Masahiko Hamanaka, Yoshinobu Koujin, Takamitsu Komatsu, and 
Shuichiro Urata, pp 61-65 
  NEC has developed an on-line handwritten Japanese character 
recognition system on a V810 RISC microprocessor. This 
recognition system employs a hierarchical classification 
technique based on flexible template matching, which frees users 
from the constraints of stroke order and connectivity in 
handwriting. Handy pen-based computing with highly user-friendly 
Japanese recognition can be realized using the V810, with its 
high cost-performance and low power consumption. 
  Development of 64 M Bit DRAM. Yoshinori Matsui, Akihiko

  NEC has developed the world's latest commercial 64 M bit 
DRAM. This paper discusses the new process and circuit 
techniques in the 64 M bit DRAM. Bit organization is x 4/x 8/x 
16, packed in SOJ and TSOP(II) by LOC (Lead On Chip) technology. 
The Triple Well process technique and new boost circuit scheme 
have achieved the fastest access time of 38 ns at Ta = 70C 
and VCC = 3.0 V. Regarding spec value, RAS access time is 50 ns, 
cycle time is 90 ns and operating current is 100 mA. The dual 
wordline scheme with distributed wordline driver circuit has 
made it possible to use the conventional lithography technique, 
rather than complicated lithography schemes like multi-layer 
photo resist and phase shifting technique. Thus, it has 
successfully reduced the manufacturing cost.

pin-400 mil SOJ, the PD461009/9L in 36 pin-400 mil SOJ, and 
the PD461016L/18L in 44 pin-400 mil SOJ or TSOP. These 
high-speed BiCMOS static RAMs use an 0.5 m double layer 
aluminum process, high-performance transistors, an optimized 
layout plan, and a voltage regulator that keeps the internal 
circuit voltage constant. 
  288 K Bit Ultra High-Speed Synchronous ECL SRAM. Hiroyuki 
Takahashi, Hisamitsu Kimoto, Masahumi Mitsuishi, Masakazu 
Sasaki, and Takahisa Migita, pp 89-92 
  NEC has developed a 32 K x 9 bit synchronous static RAM with 
the cycle time of 6 ns and the access time of 3 ns, which are 
the world's fastest. This high-speed SRAM family with the ECL 
I/O interface consists of two types of product, which have the 
different synchronous circuits of register and latch. A low 
power consumption of 0.9 W has enabled the adoption of plastic 
package, that is 52 pin PLCC. This performance has been achieved 
by 0.5 m BiCMOS process technology, new circuit technology 
(for instance, the differential BiCMOS register), and layout 
technology for noise reduction.

Toshiya Hayashi, pp 148-152 
  NEC has developed a CMOS-gate array named Universal PCI 
series with the PCI local bus interface. The PCI interface 
including conventional TTL interface and CMOS interface either 
for 3.3 V signaling environment and 5 V signaling environment 
are realized by selecting I/O buffer type. Furthermore, 
``Universal PCI buffer'' for 3.3 V is programmed by an external 
power supply voltage of 3.3 V and 5 V, respectively, without 
changing the hardware of chip. The Universal PCI series features 
an 0.6-micron (drawn) silicon-gate CMOS technology with 
ultrahigh-speed operation of 0.20 ns (2 input NAND gate with F/O 
= 1, L = 0 mm). The eight masters are offered from 20 K gate to 
209 K gate complexity with various package options. A 
high-performance system can be realized by using this gate array 
family with the PCI local bus specifications and additional 
high-speed interface consideration such as GTL I/O buffers. This 
paper describes the product regarding the PCI interface buffer 
implementation, and gives an outline of the PCI specifications.

  NEC has developed a cell-based IC, CB-C8, which runs in the 
low-voltage range (2.7 V to 3.6 V) and features high-speed (more 
than 175 MHz), by using CMOS 0.5 m process technologies. The 
CB-C8 has a high performance which is 1.5 times in speed and 3 
times in integration as compared with the previous IC, CB-C7 (3 
V version). The CB-C8 also has various macros which are CPU 
macros (V30 MX, etc.), peripheral macros (7105X, etc.), memory 
macros (SRAM, ROM, etc.), analog macros (ADC, DAC, etc.), high 
speed interface macros (Rambus[.sup]TM[/], etc.) and others. 
The CB-C8 is thus applicable to OA equipment and various other 
applications. The design environment and testability for the 
CB-C8 have been improved so that users can easily handle it. 
  ASIC Design System OpenCAD Ver. 3.0. Osamu Yoshimura, 
Yoshitaka Horikoshi, Keisuke Shinjo, Hiroshi Sakuma, Tohru 
Kamisaki, Michitoshi Honma, Katsuya Furuki, and Satoko Yamanari, 
pp 159-165 
  This paper discusses an ASIC design system, OpenCAD V3. 
Since 
its previous version V2, the system has incorporated the 
following three enhancements: 
  (1) To integrate NEC proprietary tools having been available 
in VISTASL III into the OpenCAD structure; 
  (2) to support a delay calculation method called ``Table 
look-up'' taking into account input slew effects; 
  (3) to employ a consistent delay model across all the design 
tools. 
  The OpenCAD V3 meets the following factors essential to ASIC 
design: 
  (1) A variety of NEC proprietary tools and third party tools 
at the customer's choice at any design step; 
  (2) easy operation by a framework and GUI technology; 
  (3) design accuracy guaranteeing less than 10 percent 
difference relative to silicon; 
  (4) short TAT as a result of 5 to 10X performance 
improvement 
from the past.

the newly designed MQW-DFB-Laser diode. MQW structure and module 
designs are optimized to achieve the analog transmission 
characteristics, such as low distortion, low noise, high fiber 
optical power output. As a sufficient characteristic for optical 
CATV system, 80 channels/30 km signal transmission in the 
frequency range of 50-600 MHz has been successfully obtained. 
  Super Low-Noise Hetero-Junction FET. Seiji Ichikawa, Junichi 
Tanaka, Tomoaki Hirokawa, and Hiromitsu Hirayama, pp 238-240 
  In step with the rapid growth of the DBS (Direct 
Broadcasting 
Satellite Service) market, there is an increasing demand for 
high-performance in DBS converters. Therefore, the development 
of high-performance and low-price FETs has been urgently 
required. NEC has developed a new super low-noise HJ-FET 
(NE32884C) with high-gain characteristic for the front-end 
application of the DBS converters. This HJ-FET shows excellent 
noise and gain performance at 12 GHz (NF = 0.6 dBtyp. 
G[.sub]a[/] = 12.5 dBtyp.) and is very suitable for realizing 
super low-noise and high-gain performances in DBS converters. 
This paper outlines the characteristics of NE32884C. 
  L-S Band SPDT Switch IC. Takeshi Umemoto, Tatsuya Miya,

  [Text] Nihon Seishi and Marubeni Corp. will embark on their 
Indonesian joint venture project in pulp manufacturing and 
afforestation with a local firm. The total cost required is 
about $900 million (approximately &yen;93 billion). Nihon Seishi 
will provide technical guidance in the construction of a pulp 
mill with an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons pulp for 
exportation to Europe and China. On May 8, 1994, Nihon Seishi 
signed a basic contract with an Indonesian Zaibatu company, 
Barito Pacific, covering the areas of technical aid and 
operational guidance. The target date for plant operation is 
1997. Unlike the Japanese market currently suffering from excess 
supply, the Chinese market has a tremendous growth potential. 
Because of its expanding demand for paper, the companies also 
are considering the use of the venture company as a supply base 
for raw materials to be exported to China. Also under 
consideration for the future is paper manufacturing technology 
transfer to China and Indonesia. 
  This is the first time that Japanese companies have 
participated in a joint venture for pulp manufacturing in 
Indonesia. Shortly, Barito will form a joint venture company, 
[Tanjun Enimu Resta], with Nihon Seishi and Marubeni. The total 
cost of this undertaking is $900 million, of which the amount of 
capital is estimated at around $250 million, with Barito Corp. 
providing approximately $200 million and the Japanese companies 
approximately $50 million. Of the $50 million, approximately $8 
million will be provided by Nihon Seishi, approximately $20 
million by Marubeni, and the remainder to be picked up by 
government organizations. They plan to secure remaining amount 
through financing by Japan Export Bank and financial and 
institutions in Northern Europe and England. 
  The factory will be constructed at the [beribin] District of 
the southern part of the Sumatra Island. The companies are 
planning to bring the latest state-of-the-art equipment made in 
Northern Europe into the factory. The pulp factory with the 
annual production of 450,000 tons represents the largest-scale 
plant thus far participated by Japanese companies. Construction 
is scheduled to begin this year. Nihon Seishi plans to send 
approximately 50 engineers to provide technical guidance during 
a peak demand period. In the vicinity, Barito Corp. holds a 
300,000-hectare plantation of fast-growing acacia. These trees 
are cut every 7 years for use. 
  The amount of pulp produced by Indonesia for 1992 was 
approximately 1.2 million tons, slightly over one-tenth that of 
Japan's output. In the future, however, its pulp industry is 
expected to gain strength, its competitive power equaling to 
that of Brazil in the pulp exports field. Moreover, it is 
located close to China, a country ranking third in the world in 
the amount of paper consumed and currently facing the shortage 
of wood pulp. For the present, however, a greater part of 
manufactured pulp will be exported to Europe. What Nihon Seishi 
is aiming for, however, is to secure a market which can replace 
the present Japanese market suffering from oversupply; the 
company, therefore, has decided to establish a beachhead, as it 
were, in Indonesia so that when time comes it will be ready to 
take on a paper manufacturing joint venture in China. As for 
Marubeni, which handles approximately 1.2 million tons of pulp a 
year, its aim is the expansion of its business.

  The participation in pulp manufacturing in Indonesia is the 
first large-scale overseas venture undertaken by Nihon Seishi, a 
company established by the merger of Jujo Paper Co. and 
Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co. in April 1993. Shin Oji Paper Co., which 
was formed in October of the same year, also is providing 
Thailand with [sashi] technology. Under the present condition in 
Japan, because of surplus facilities and stagnant demand, 
neither company is able to gain full benefit from the merger. 
Asia, on the other hand, is an attractive market where companies 
can expect rapid growth in consumer demand. They are driven by 
necessity to move forward with the building of the Asian market 
which includes China while restructuring the Japanese market. 
  The aim of Indonesia, on the other hand, is to turn its 
abundant forest resource into high-value-added export items. 
Especially Barito-Pacific Corporation, which has achieved a 
rapid growth in the plywood export business, was eager to import 
pulp manufacturing technology to their country, thereby 
providing a perfect setup for Japanese companies to enter a 
joint venture with them. Marubeni is considering the transfer of 
its paper-making technology to Barito. 
  Pulp manufacturing by Japanese paper manufacturers abroad 
has 
been flourishing since the 1970's. Daishowa Paper Mfg. and 
Marubeni jointly entered the Canadian market while Oji Paper Co. 
(present Shin Oji Paper Co.) and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp (present 
Nihon Seishi) jointly went to New Zealand. However, their 
objective at that time was to secure a supply of raw materials 
for Japan as its forest resource just about then began to 
decline and was unable to meet Japan's needs. 
  For Nihon Seishi, emphasis will be on exports to Europe. 
What 
is vastly different about the present strategy from the past 
overseas strategy is that, this time, the company appears to be 
targeting the Chinese market. Japan's annual production capacity 
for Japanese paper and plywood is 33 million tons, whereas the 
annual hovers around 28 million-tons. There is even a suggestion 
floated--that Japan should export surplus facilities to China. 
Although the Japanese pulp market has begun to recover, the 
present situation, still calling for companies like Nihon Seishi 
and Mitsubishi Corp. to reduce the rate of facility operation, 
by means needs exportation of pulp. 
  The total volume of paper consumed in China and ASEAN 
countries, on the other hand, continues to grow by 10% 
annually 
since 1985, reaching approximately 25 million tons in 1992, 
90% 
of what Japanese consumes. Surely it is the wish of every paper 
company to be able to tie Indonesia's pulp manufacturing 
capability with a China's demand for paper, a country with the 
population of 1.2 billion people. China, ranking third in the 
world in terms of paper consumed, viz., over 19 million tons, 
has lumber pulp shortage, and it is almost certain that its 
import will rise. From the standpoint of future joint venture in 
paper manufacturing in China, Indonesia is a country which 
cannot be ignored. 
  In addition to Rengo embarking on a manufacturing joint 
venture in China, Hokuetsu Paper Mills Co. is providing a local 
company with technical assistance in paper manufacturing 
technology. However, many companies have been more cautious, 
refraining from rushing into joint ventures with local firms. 
Their excuses were that local firms lacking solid industrial 
foundations are not ready for such undertakings. It is possible, 
however, that Nihon Seishi's latest joint venture may persuade 
others to follow its suit.

  [Text] Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will provide Korean firm, 
[Kinsei Sanden] with a cogeneration system technology. The 
system under consideration is designed to generate power using 
heavy gravity oil A as well as to make effective use of waste 
heat. Showa Shell will offer design and know-how of the method 
of evaluating the system's cost effectiveness. In Asia, 
including Korea, cogeneration technology has yet to enjoy a 
widespread use. Noting a rapid increase in energy demand, the 
company had decided that cogeneration technology shows promise 
and begun aiming for building a foothold for entry into the 
Korean market. 
  The petroleum cogeneration system is an electric power 
saving 
system which, in addition to generating power mainly used in 
diesel engines, utilizes waste heat used in meeting demands for 
hot water and air conditioning. According to the contract signed 
by both parties, Showa Shell Sekiyu will provide the design 
techniques for optimal equipment. The figures used for the level 
of usage of heat and electricity by building owners and other 
types of users are based on assumption. The company also will 
allow the use of its own programs specifically developed for 
assessing the system's cost effectiveness. 
  In the area of training, Showa Shell already has received 
two 
technical trainees from Korea. When a purchase order has been 
successfully concluded in Korea, the company will send its own 
engineers/technicians if requested by the Korean firm. The term 
of the contract on technical cooperation is two years. 
  Showa Shell installed a 3000kW cogeneration system in a 
shopping center, which opened last year in Sagamihara City, 
Kanagawa Prefecture, to provide its retail store tenants with 
heat and electricity. This was the first time oil was sold in 
this way in Japan, directly from the petroleum company to users. 
In the future, the similar method will be used in 
variously-located regional development projects. 
  In Asia, economic development is creating a rapid growth in 
energy demand, resulting in shortage of electric power supply 
which is becoming extremely serious. Although development of 
electric sources is moving rapidly, it is not possible to catch 
up with demand at present. For this reason, such a distributed 
electric source as an oil cogeneration system is attracting 
attention, If the Korean venture should prove successful, then 
the technology could spread to other regions of Asia.

  [Text] Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co. (president: 
Mr. Jiro Hoshino) will provide a garbage incineration technology 
to China's leading can manufacturing equipment maker, Qingdao 
Commonly-Used Machine Factory (factory head: Mr. Zhou Aimin, 
Qingdao City). It is a fluid-bed type which uses sand as a 
combustion medium. Recently, an agreement was signed with 
Chinese [Gikishinshutsu] Company (President: Mr. Zhang Han Chen, 
Beijing City) serving as a contract agent. This is the first 
time that Japan is providing China with a garbage incinerator. 
This is in response to China's new awareness of environmental 
problems, which is gathering momentum, especially in cities. 
Taking this opportunity, Mitsui is ready to provide technical 
support in other environmental areas, such as treatment of 
sewage, plant waste water and flue gases, as well. 
<H5>  To Provide Active Support in Sewage/Gas Exhaust Treatment </H5>
  The main point of the contract is that Mitsui is to provide 
all necessary technologies related to the fluid-bed type garbage 
incineration facilities, ranging from design, manufacturing, 
construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as know-how. 
Also covered by the contract is the implementation of training 
programs, including those to be conducted in Japan for Chinese 
trainees. Although the matter of constructing facilities is not 
specified at present, if it should surface, 
engineers/technicians also will be sent from Japan. The term of 
the stipulations is 10 years, during which period, China will 
have the exclusive right of its enforcement in Mainland China. 
The Quigdao Commonly-used Machine Factory to which the 
technologies will be provided, is a manufacturer of pressure 
vessels and switch exchangers. Since the company has the ability 
of supplying the various components of the garbage incineration 
facilities on its own, what it will be receiving from Mitsubishi 
is technical support in the overall process design. Currently, 
Mitsubishi Engineering and Shipbuilding is in the process of 
putting together a design package containing technical materials 
required in design work and data for analysis. It will take 
about 6 months before it can complete the transfer of the 
technologies to the Chinese company. 
  The fluid-bed method garbage incineration is a technology 
designed to use sand heated at high temperature as a medium for 
burning garbage. It can deal with all types of garbage, ranging 
from high-water-content low-calorie garbage to a high calorie 
one containing a large quantity of plastics. Moreover, it is 
characterized by high combustion efficiency, leaving very little 
which remains unburned. Since 1982, Mitsui Engineering and 
Shipbuilding has delivered over 20 incineration systems mostly 
to self-governing bodies. Last year, the company delivered a 
system facility with a daily treatment capacity of 100 tons to 
Korea, the first time its product was delivered to overseas. 
  As for delivery to China, although there is an instance of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' delivery of a mechanical type city 
garbage incineration equipment, insofar as the fluid-bed type 
system is concerned, this is the first time it will be done. 
China's city garbage is more like what we consider raw garbage, 
and for this reason, a high demand exists for the fluid bed-type 
offering high combustion efficiency. Moreover, today, when the 
protection of environments on a global scale is intensely 
pursued, the need for treatment of wastes other than garbage, 
namely, sewage, factory waste water, and exhaust gases, is 
becoming urgent. Mitsubish wants to provide support to 
activities in these areas as well.

  [Text] Adjacent to the Nanjing International Airport 
currently under construction in the suburbs of the City of 
Nanjing in Jiangdu Province, a large-scale international 
industrial city will be constructed. [Nanjing, Jiang Ning 
Province, Lu Kou Zhen Government, [(chinchou: Mr. Wang Baoguo)] 
will develop an area of 660 hectares adjacent to the north of 
the airport to build a new city where high-tech industries will 
be to invited to come and carry out their research, 
manufacturing, and commercial activities. China already has 
contacted Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS; 
chairman: Mr. Takehiko Matsuda) requesting its cooperation in 
the matter. 
  JTTAS currently is implementing its plans jointly with 
[Japan 
Management Planning Research Institute], and as early as April, 
Commission on Concept of City for Nanjing International City 
Technology Exchange will be established so that it can begin 
studying the matter. The Chinese plans are to establish an 
international industrial city by inviting approximately 500 
companies from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States to 
establish their industrial bases here. The future possibility 
will include the expansion of the city by tenfold, indicating a 
new opportunity for development of Sino-Japanese cooperation 
scheme. 
  The Nanjing International Airport construction project ranks 
high in importance in China, aiming for the end of 1996 as a 
target date for the completion of the first phase of the 
construction work. Jiang Ning Province's Lu Kou Zhen, where the 
airport will be constructed, is positioned at the south shore of 
the Chang River approximately 30 km south of Nanjing. Here the 
international industrial city, a site of participating 
countries' high-tech research industries, will be constructed. 
In addition to the industrial zone, commerce, public 
administration, and residential zones will be established. As 
facilities, international conference halls, trade fair halls, 
universities, and management/maintenance buildings can be 
considered. China will be responsible for improving 
infrastructures. Within from 3 to 5 years' time, foreign 
companies will be able to move into the city. In the future, 
China is considering expanding the city to cover an area of up 
to 6,600 hectares. 
  JTTAS plans to provide Japanese businesses with information 
on the project by June. As for attracting companies from Korea, 
Taiwan, the U.S., and Hong Kong, JTTAS will establish a third 
sector, fully cooperating with China in this matter.

  [Text]NTT and Microsoft are developing delivery services 
for multimedia information. They have begun work on a software 
delivery system that uses compact-disc ROMs (CD ROMs). In 
another venture, NTT Data Communication is working with Softbank 
on setting up a company to deliver video-on-demand. Both 
alliances are efforts by NTT to borrow outside expertise to 
realize the idea of multimedia. 
  NTT announced it formed a joint venture with Microsoft in 
March to begin developing a multimedia information delivery 
service. The joint development by both companies is a basic 
technology for distributing software for personal computers, 
movies, and music over networks. Their goal is to implement a 
new delivery system for multimedia information. 
  NTT had just entered into a joint venture with General Magic 
in January 1994. That makes this the second agreement made with 
a foreign software vendor. NTT's aim is to reflect the powerful 
software technology for terminals onto its network services. 
  Several days after the announcement of the venture between 
NTT and Microsoft, NTT Data Communication and Softbank, the 
giant distributor of PC software, revealed that they will 
bolster NTT's efforts. Both companies will use NTT's 
optical-fiber network and establish a new service-providing 
company for video-on-demand to deliver movies to viewers when 
desired. 
  In the announcement made in January 1994, NTT emphasized the 
need to form bonds with other companies. (See ``The Basic Idea 
of Multimedia,'' Nikkei Communications, 7 February 
1994, pp. 21-23.) Through this dramatic series of alliances, NTT 
stands at the starting line for achieving this idea. 
<H5>  Distributing CD ROM Encrypted Keys </H5>
  Two technologies will be developed with Microsoft. One is a 
delivery system for PC software and movies using CD ROMs. The 
software is encrypted and stored on CD ROMs. The user will pay a 
software licensing fee to receive an encrypted key on line. The 
second technology connects NTT's facsimile communication 
service, F-Net, to Microsoft's software systems for office 
automation, At Work. Neither technology, however, is touted as a 
true multimedia delivery system. 
  Figure 1 illustrates the system configuration of a software 
delivery system using CD ROMs. The user buys inexpensive CD ROMs 
storing encrypted PC software, movies, music, and games. The 
encryption method is based on NTT technology. Encrypted software 
cannot be directly used. The key must be purchased to release 
the code; it is transmitted over the NTT network. NTT will 
collect software usage fees from users. Future studies will 
involve transmitting not only keys, but the software itself. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-33A>      Figure 1. Information Delivery System Using CD ROMs Targeted by NTT and Microsoft </FIG>

&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Media Provider; 2. Computer Software; 3. Movies; 
4. Music; 5. (1) CD ROM with encrypted and recorded data; 6. (2) 
Purchase at a low cost; 7. (3) Obtain encryption key on line; 8. 
(4) Pay fee; 9. (5) Commission for fee collection; 10. (6) 
Return of collected fees; 11. User; 12. Personal 
Computer.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Who will supply the CD ROMs? Distributors of PC software are 
among the companies expressing interest. Masayoshi Son, 
president of Softbank, comments that if a new delivery 
infrastructure can be created, his company would aggressively 
use it. According to him, the job of a distributor is to collect 
software and store it on CD ROMs. Softbank is already beginning 
a similar service in the United States. The user places an order 
by telephone, receives the key to release the encryption from an 
operator, and enters it into the personal computer. 
<H5>  Making F-Net Compatible with At Work </H5>
  The objective of connecting F-Net to At Work is to use the 
graphical user interface (GUI) provided by At Work and simplify 
the operation of F-Net. Its implementation is planned for a year 
from now. At that time, the data transmission protocol of At 
Work will be supported by F-Net. 
  The advantage is communication costs are controlled if F-Net 
is used when a large number of facsimiles are broadcast over 
short distances. However, using F-Net is not always convenient, 
for example, registering the broadcast destinations presents 
problems. There are two registration methods. The first sends 
the list of destinations to NTT. Here, registration lasts 
several days. In the second method, the destinations are entered 
on the mark sheet used by NTT, then this sheet is sent by 
facsimile. In this case, registration is immediate, but filling 
in the mark sheet is complicated. This task can be simplified by 
using the facsimiles incorporated into At Work and PCs. 
<H5>  Target: 10 Million Subscribers by 2000 Using NTT Optical </H5>
Fibers 
  The joint venture established in April 1994 by NTT Data 
Communication and Softbank is called Mediabank Enterprises. NTT 
Data Communication's percentage of the investment is 40% 
and 
Softbank's is 60%. Masayoshi Son, Softbank's president, 
is also 
acting as the president of the joint venture. In addition to 
video-on-demand, ticket sales, karaoke, games, telemarketing 
businesses are being planned. 
  Full operation is slated to begin in March 1995. Until then, 
preparation of the rate structure for users and information 
providers and selection of the equipment needed in two-way cable 
and television are proceeding. NTT Data Communication will be in 
charge of the operation of the center's facilities. 
  Son stated a goal of 10 million household subscribers by the 
year 2000 and presented a model plan for a bold rate structure 
(Figure 2). A set-top CATV converter box is loaned free of 
charge. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-34A>      Figure 2. Rate Structure of the Video-on-Demand Service </FIG>

from Mediabank Enterprises. Mediabank Enterprises will change 
its name to Mediabank when it begins operation. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. Ordinary Household 2. Circuit Usage Fees 3. Usage 
Fee (Movie) 4. &yen;300/film 5. &yen;1,200/month 6. Basic Fee 7. 
&yen;2,000/month 8. Contract 9. &yen;100/film 10. &yen;800/month 
11. Mediabank 12. Information Provider (IP) 13. Contract 14. 
Center Usage Fee 15. NTT Data Communication&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  According to Son, NTT's infrastructure will be the maximum 
limit of the network for providing services. As one link in the 
multimedia idea, optical fibers will extend to ordinary 
households who will probably become major users. There are no 
plans at this time to use the cables owned by CATV businesses. 
In 1995 NTT will participate in tests of multimedia services for 
homes. 
  Until the optical-fiber network spreads, business start-ups 
will focus on markets for specific applications, for example, 
delivering movies to hotels, or supplying karaoke and software.

  [Text] Mazda and Furukawa Electric jointly developed 
Advanced PALMNET, a multiplex communication system for vehicles 
having a transmission speed of 1 Mb/s. This makes integrated 
control possible not only for systems in the cabin like the air 
conditioner, but for drive systems like the engine. Since 
vehicle functions will expand in the future, this technology 
will have a position in the communication infrastructure. Three 
communication LSIs were developed in this project. However, when 
they will be installed in mass-produced vehicles remains 
undecided. 
  Today, high-speed, large capacity networks that can't be 
used 
now are being constructed and made ready to meet future demand. 
This is the groundwork for creating an infrastructure typified 
by the information superhighway in the United States. 
  Advanced PALMNET developed by Mazda and Furukawa Electric is 
a multiplex communication system (automotive LAN) to provide a 
communication infrastructure inside vehicles. The introduction 
of 1-Mb/s LAN inside vehicles will enable integrated control of 
not only electronic devices in the cabin like the air 
conditioner, but will extend control to devices in the drive 
system like the engine and suspension. (See Figure 1 which 
appeared in Nikkei Electronics, 14 March 1994, p. 
9.)[.sup]1[/] In line with this objective, three 
communication LSIs were developed (Table 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-35A>      Figure 1. Example System Configuration of the LAN Developed for Vehicles. The two configurations are a low-and </FIG>

medium-speed LAN with its 125 kb/s transmission speed and a 
high-speed LAN with its 1 Mb/s transmission speed. Three 
communication LSIs were developed. The low- and medium-speed LAN 
has the Basic-IC as its core 8-bit microprocessor for control 
and the I/O-IC that integrates only data transmission and 
reception functions. The high-speed Hi-IC is a communication LSI 
that is connected to an existing control microprocessor.

0.8-m rule CMOS technology is used. The standard access method is 
carrier-sensing multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). 


<H5>  Preparing for the Next Generation </H5>
  The time frame for installing this system in mass-produced 
vehicles is still undecided. The 20-kb/s PALMNET developed by 
both companies in 1989 was installed in Eunos Cosmo, a 
mass-produced car. Its goals were to control cabin systems, like 
air conditioning, and fault diagnosis.[.sup]2[/] 
  Rather than being a product for the immediate future, Mazda 
considers Advanced PALMNET to be a part of the communication 
infrastructure provided for the next generation of vehicles that 
will be safely driven under electronic control and will use the 
Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) for 
navigation. According to Furukawa Electric, the three 
communication LSIs developed here are practical devices that can 
be installed in mass-produced vehicles (Figure 2). 
&lt;graphic&gt; 
&lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Evaluation Board. The three communication LSIs 
developed here are finished products that can be installed in 
mass-production vehicles.&lt;/graphic&gt; 

  First, installation will begin with luxury cars in which the 
number of wire harnesses (electrical lines for connections) 
exceeds 1,000 lines. This is associated with a 10% 
decrease in 
costs. In addition, space efficiency will improve. For example, 
a theft prevention system uses multiple sensors. Thus, if an LAN 
is installed in a car, new wires do not have to be pulled again 
from each part of the car to install the system. 
  When audio equipment is added on later, it can correspond to 
a dealer's option and not a manufacturer's option. 
<H5>  Compatibility with Communication Path Faults in ISO </H5>
Proposals 
  The two LAN systems developed here for vehicles are a 
high-speed 1-Mb/s LAN and a low- and medium-speed 125-kb/s LAN. 
The high-speed LAN uses shielded twisted-pair wiring; the low- 
and medium-speed version uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring. 
  A feature of the high-speed protocol is the Simultaneous 
Data 
Gathering (SDG) function. In one transmission frame, data can be 
simultaneously collected from multiple nodes. This enables 
concurrent processing of multiple sensor data as in 4-wheel 
anti-skid brakes (4ASB) and 4-wheel steering (4WS). 
  In the high-speed LSI (Hi-IC), the innovation of a 
driver/receiver is built in. So even when faults like short or 
open circuits occur in the transmission line, communication is 
possible. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 
proposes that transmission be possible in the presence of nine 
types of faults. This LSI handles all of them. 
  When a fault occurs in either signal line of the 
twisted-pair 
wires, the shielded wire is used for transmission (Figure 3). 
Usually, balanced transmission takes place in the twisted-pair 
wires. In this case, this shielded wire is set to +2.5 V. When a 
fault occurs in signal line A, the voltage level of 
the shielded wire is set to +5 V and unbalanced transmission 
takes place in signal line B and the shielded wire. 
When a fault occurs in signal line B, the shielded 
wire becomes 0 V. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-028L-37A>      Figure 3. Transmission during Fault Generation in the High-Speed LAN. </FIG>

In the high-speed LAN, there is a switching function for the transmission system to use the shielded wire as 
the signal line when a fault like wire disconnection occurs. 
This function is incorporated into the driver/receiver of Hi-IC. 
(a) Normal operation: Balanced transmission uses signal lines A 
and B. (b) Fault generated in signal line A: Unbalanced 
transmission uses signal line B and the shield wire. (c) Fault 
generated in signal line B: Unbalanced transmission uses signal 
line A and the shield wire. 
&lt;annot&gt; Key: 1. (a) Normal operation; 2. Signal Line A; 3. 
Shield; 4. Signal Line B; 5. (b) Fault generated in signal line

  [Text] The Engineering Research Association for 
Super/Hyper-Sonic Transport Propulsion Systems (HYPR) and 
overseas aircraft engine manufacturers including General 
Electric (GE), USA will begin design work on the overall 
structure of the next generation engine to be used for 
hypersonic transport planes, which they have been developing 
jointly. Since successful completion of the combustion test of 
the core engine recently, the Japan-U.S.-European partners will 
make a final decision on allocation of responsibilities for 
development and design of the details, and begin the design 
process. Future prospects for development are somewhat grim, 
having been slowed down by budget cuts. But now that the overall 
design finally has been approved, the project seems to be a step 
closer to commercialization. 
  To date, various basic technology research, including that 
related to turbojets and measurement control systems, has been 
conducted. Successful combustion testing of the ``core engine,'' 
including the compressor, combustor, and high pressure turbine, 
persuaded the researchers that their fundamental technology 
research has met their goals, and prepared them to proceed to 
the overall design phase. The design phase is estimated to last 
two years, from FY94-95. 
  The HYPR includes three Japanese companies, 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., plus 
United Technology (UT), GE, from the United States, Rolls Royce 
from the UK, and Snecma from France. Together they have been 
developing an engine for hypersonic transport planes. Before the 
overall design phase begins, the companies which are responsible 
for different components must consult one another in order to 
coordinate the interface between their respective components and 
finalize allocation of their responsibilities at a general 
meeting in May. 
  One example of this coordination problem is found in 
development of the ``ramcombustor'' located at the rear of the 
engine which must operate during flight at over Mach 3. KHI, 
which is in charge of developing the combustor's ``flame 
holder'' and UTC which is in charge of a portion of exterior 
plate around the combustor, must agree upon the joint structure 
and the number of holes for bolts. 
  Production of components based on the overall design plan is 
scheduled to begin in FY96 at the earliest. 
  While overall design work is under way a number of 
combustion 
tests also will be conducted to verify its reliability. In 
November, the first combustion tests of the overall turbojet 
with a low pressure turbine installed in the core engine will be 
conducted.

  [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Ltd. have received an order from the National Space 
Development Agency (NASDA) for a mobile launcher (ML) for the 
large domestically built H-2 rocket. Total cost of the order for 
both companies is 3 billion yen. The ML will be built next to 
the assembly tower at Yoshinobu Launch Complex of the 
Tanegashima Space Center (Kagoshima Prefecture) to have a spare 
rocket on stand-by. The season during which rockets can be 
launched is restricted to 90 days, including both summer and 
winter, in order to comply with regulations that protect local 
fishing rights. NASDA hopes to improve launching efficiency by 
expanding the launch facilities. 
  Not only can the ML be used to assemble rockets, it also can 
transport rockets excluding satellites and fairings from the 
assembly tower to the launch pad and be used as a launcher as 
well. ML No.2 with a spare H-2 rocket will be built as a 
stand-by next to the ML No.1 which was used for the H-2 launch 
in February 1994. 
  Main features of ML No.2 include: 
  1) launch deck (ML body); 
  2) travel device and machine equipment including a launch 
stabilizer; 
  3) cooling water facility. 
  The launch deck is 22 meters wide, 18 meters long, and 4 
meters thick. The travel device can move at a maximum speed of 8 
meters per minute on tracks. 
  KHI's contract includes production and engineering of the ML 
body, travel device, relief tracks, and lighting equipment, as 
well as orbital replacement work. The cost of the order is 1.55 
billion yen. On the other hand, MHI's contract for equipment, 
including the ambilical service pod to supply liquid oxygen and 
liquid hydrogen to the rockets, engine exhaust, upper deck, and 
cooling water facility to cool the launch stand, totals 
&yen;1.45 billion. 
  Construction of ML No.2 is scheduled for completion in 
December 1994, in time for use during the third H-2 launch in 
early 1995. In case the rocket on ML No.1 runs into trouble, the 
rocket standing by on ML No.2 can be launched, thus avoiding 
launch delays of various experimental and future commercial 
satellites.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and 
aerospace manufacturers including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, 
Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. will begin drastic 
design changes, aiming at commercializing the large domestically 
produced H-2 rockets. The changes, including modification of the 
main LE-7 engine, will be extensive. They are intended to reduce 
production costs of 16 billion yen incurred during the first 
successful launch by 30 percent within three years, and 
eventually by as much as 50 percent. French Ariane Space has 60 
percent of the global rocket market, including the launch of 
communication satellites. These design changes will facilitate 
Japan's entry into world wide commercial competition, and also 
will promote other Japanese space developments, including the 
Japanese ``HOPE'' space shuttle which will be launched by H-2 
rocket. 
  Aerospace manufacturers and Rocket Systems, a rocket 
procurement company, have presented a list of several hundred 
modification plans, including: 
  1) reduction in the number of parts that make up the main 
LE-7 engine; 
  2) change in a portion of the fairing materials; 
  3) revision of major components for the ``LE-5A'' second 
stage engine. 
  Cost reductions should be achieved through improvements in 
the production process and maximum utilization of mass 
production. 
  MHI has proposed a new development plan for an advanced 
LE-7, 
the core of the H-2, which will reduce production costs by 
several hundred million yen through some changes in the position 
of parts without changing the main structure. IHI will reduce 
the number of components in the turbopump which is the major 
component of the LE-7 and LE-5A. 
  KHI has proposed material changes including substitution of 
iron for titanium in parts of the tip of the rocket that doesn't 
require such high quality. Nissan Motor, which is in charge of 
production of the booster rocket, will work on improving the 
production process. NASDA will make a final decision selection 
of the proposals by mid-April. 
  Launching costs, including production and fuel, total 
approximately 19 billion yen per rocket at present. That will 
remain constant for the next two rockets scheduled for launch in 
the near future. This &yen;19 billion is a far cry from the 
Ariane rocket's launch cost of approximately &yen;10 billion, 
and therefore NASDA has requested modifications in design from 
the Japanese manufacturers. 
  The latest modification program which reduces production 
costs by 30 percent will affect the 6th and 7th launches which 
are scheduled for around 1997-1999. The 50-percent cost 
reduction of &yen;8 billion is expected to be achieved during 
the 12th rocket launch scheduled for some time after the year 
2000. This will drop per-launch costs to around &yen;11 billion, 
including fuels and inspection. Cooperation between government 
and industry to promote mass production also is expected to 
reduce the cost of the HOPE project.

  [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (KHI, President, 
Hiroshi Oba) has developed a functionally gradient material 
(FGM) which endures temperatures of up to 1,600 C which 
they intend to apply to components of gas turbine engines. This 
new zirconia/titanium aluminum-based FGM was made to resist 
extremely high temperature by creating a very special 
composition of zirconia on the surface which gets exposed to 
high temperatures. Traditionally, 1,400 C has been 
considered the maximum temperature materials such as nickel 
alloy can resist. KHI succeeded in improving the heat resistance 
by 200 C by making the joining boundary of thermal 
insulation and cooling structural materials into a gradient 
structure. KHI will present a paper on this subject at a June 
meeting of the Japan Institute of Metals. 
  The increases in performance required in gas turbine engines 
and the engines intended for use in hyper/super-sonic aircraft 
have spurred the search for new heat resistant materials that 
can consistently endure higher temperatures. Engine 
manufacturers around the world have been striving to 
commercialize gas turbine engines now that gradient structural 
materials are being applied to thermal insulation/forced cooling 
structures that maintain stable temperatures with little load on 
the cooling system. 
  KHI intends to use their newly developed FGM able to endure 
temperatures of 1,600 C for components of gas turbine 
engines. They expect to market it within the next two to three 
years. 
  KHI has established the long awaited thermal insulation 
design method which has been demonstrated under actual 
environmental conditions. KHI also has developed expertise on 
destruction mechanisms for relaxation of thermal stress/material 
design. KHI's latest commercialization plan is based on 
accumulation of these basic technological accomplishments. 
Successful marketing requires that engineering requirements are 
met precisely, an objective KHI has achieved. 
  KHI, together with the Japan Atomic Energy Research 
Institute, also has for some time been promoting development of 
an electric insulation FGM for components for nuclear fusion 
reactors. They have produced a pipe-shaped 
stainless/zirconia/stainless prototype 30mm in diameter. Ceramic 
is sandwiched between metals which can be welded with other 
metal materials outside. The compositional transition between 
the ceramic and the metals is gradual, thus achieving a new 
gradient functions of electric property and weldability. This is 
the first material created whose composition changes gradually 
on both sides of the material. This joint research group now is 
developing larger aperture pipes of 150mm diameter. 
  KHI is confident that they now are at the stage at which FGM 
is ready for practical application, and therefore plan to 
vigorously pursue its commercial potential.

<H5>  Manufacturers Mastering Use of Photomolding Systems in </H5>
Development/Production Processes 
  Photomolding systems for producing solid, three-dimensional 
models using photocured resins (plastics that harden when 
subjected to light rays) have been around in Japan for the past 
five years. Manufacturers who have mastered these systems have 
been getting good results using them in ordinary operations. 
There are numerous examples of photomolding systems being used 
in the development process to create prototypes for verification 
and testing purposes, and in the production process for vacuum 
casting and to make casting models. All past methods for 
accomplishing these same tasks required large amounts of time 
and money. The point of mastering photomolding systems is to 
produce plastic models with minimum precision and strength. 
  Decreasing numbers of experienced, skilled technicians means 
that it now takes several weeks to produce wooden patterns for 
casting purposes, thus making it impossible for makers to 
respond to sudden orders. And pressured by budgetary constraints 
and development deadlines, manufacturers are unable to prototype 
and test their products adequately. Photomolding systems have 
the potential for solving all of these problems. 
  Photomolding systems harden or cure photocured resins in 
layers by carrying out laser scanning operations based on 
three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) data, and then 
create three-dimensional shapes by stacking sectional forms. As 
long as 3D CAD data is available, plastic models can be produced 
rapidly, and even shapes that are not possible with machine 
processing, like hollow structures, can be integrally molded 
using photomolding systems. 
  Although they share a common production method called 
"sectional stacking," various equipment have been developed 
recently according to the types of materials and processing 
methods employed. The generic term "Rapid Prototyping &amp; 
Manufacturing" (RP&amp;M) is often used to refer to this 
equipment 
and the processes they are used in. 
  There are a wide variety of uses for plastic models produced 
via photomolding systems, including prototypes for checking the 
shape and functions of products and as casting 
models.[.sup](1)[/] On the flip side of the coin, however, 
the equipment alone runs several tens of millions of yen, and 
the resin used in the photomolding process costs upwards of 
&yen;15,000 per kilogram, making photomolding systems extremely 
expensive. And there are also those who harbor doubts about the 
effectiveness of these systems, citing the need for 3D CAD data, 
and insufficient precision and molding speeds as their reasons. 
  However, progress is being made in the development and 
improvement of photomolding system equipment and resins from the 
standpoints of lowering their costs and increasing their 
accuracy and operating speeds. A Photomolding Production 
Association has also been founded, and the government has begun 
supporting photomolding systems via tax breaks and technological 
development subsidies. 
  Under these circumstances, manufacturers have already begun 
to incorporate photomolding systems into their daily operations 
and are getting results. This article relies on case studies to 
try to determine just how these systems can be utilized to 
achieve the best results, and exactly how effective they are 
from the standpoint of reducing production time and costs. 
<H5>  Plastic Models Machine Processed Using NC Tools -- Average </H5>
Daily Operating Time Is 20 Hours 
  The Nakashima Propeller Company (headquartered in Okayama 
City) introduced a photomolding system into their operations in 
March 1991, and ever since, according to Vice President Hiroshi 
Nakashima, they have been using that equipment "...as part of 
our production line." Nakashima Propeller is engaged primarily 
in the manufacture of propellers for boats and ships, and uses 
the plastic models produced via its photomolding system in place 
of wooden patterns as casting models.[.sup](2)[/] 
  The shape of a propeller will differ slightly according to 
the shape of the ship, the type of engine, the location where it 
will be used and the type of performance being sought. 
Therefore, there aren't many cases where the same shape 
propeller is mass-produced; the tendency recently being toward 
small-lot, multi-product production. 
  Up until recently, three types of casting models were used 
at Nakashima Propeller -- metal molds, wooden patterns and 
rotating molds (a kind of sand mold that employs a rotating 
squeegee-type device). Casting is performed using these models, 
and machine-processing is relied upon to complete the product. 
  Metal molds are produced in dimensions that will enable them 
to be used in common on products for which continuous demand is 
anticipated, whereas wooden patterns are used to produce 
propellers for which there is a concentrated, short-term demand. 
The rotating mold is used to turn out small lots of small-sized 
propellers, as well as large-sized propellers. 
  The company has recently been turning out increasing numbers 
of propellers with completely new shapes, and for these, has 
been relying more and more on wooden patterns and rotating 
molds. Because the rotating mold process is done completely by 
hand, it requires skilled technicians and longer production 
schedules. The same can be said for wooden patterns. The longer 
schedules, combined with a shortage of skilled technicians, have 
been making it very difficult to meet orders with short delivery 
times. 
  It was this situation that prompted Nakashima Propeller to 
take a close look at photomolding systems. Its photomolding 
system cannot be applied to the manufacture of truly large-sized 
propellers, but is more than capable of handling three-blade 
propellers, the maximum diameter of one blade of which is one 
meter. Depending on the shape of the propeller, the photomolding 
system can often produce plastic models that are closer to the 
finished product than those using wooden patterns or rotating 
molds, a factor which helps cut down on machine-processing time 
as well. 
  The costs involved in producing a single mold using the 
photomolding system are about the same as those for rotating 
molds, but because the photomolding system does not require the 
intervention of skilled technicians, according to Koichi 
Kuramoto, head of the Medical Business Office, "It is cheap when 
you think in terms of the investment required to train skilled 
technicians." 
  Compared to the roughly one week required to manufacture a 
wooden pattern for a propeller with a diameter of 80 cm, the 
photomolding system can produce the same size plastic model 
overnight. 
  The photomolding system makes effective use of nighttime 
hours to complete the molding process, leaving daytime hours for 
removing the plastic models from the molds and/or replacing the 
resins. The average operating time per day works out to 20 hours. 
  Thus, it only takes about one day to complete a plastic 
model, and several small models can be produced at a time, 
further increasing efficiency. And the photomolding system 
enables the user to enlarge the pitch of the lamination layer to 
the limits to create hollow shapes, thereby reducing molding 
time and material costs. Since the plastic models are ultimately 
machine-processed, their surfaces need not be all that precise 
upon coming out of the mold. 
  Also, it isn't like propeller designers simply determine the 
sectional forms and major dimensions to create a completely 
three-dimensional shape. That is why Nakashima Propeller 
constructed a system that makes use of CAD macro functions to 
automatically create 3D CAD data. This data is shared by the 
photomolding system and the numerically-controlled (NC) machine 
tools. But because the photomolding system produces plastic 
models that are slightly larger than the end product, some 
revisions must be made to this data. 
<H5>  Government Intervening to Improve Utilization Environment </H5>
Via Tax Breaks and Development Support Aimed at Lowering Prices 
  In October 1993, the Japanese Government added photomolding 
systems and their peripheral equipment to the list of 
systems/equipment that fall under the purview of the Basic 
Technology Research and Development Promotion System (high-tech 
tax system). These systems/equipment will remain on this list 
for one year, until September 1994. During that time, 7 percent 
of the price of purchasing such systems/equipment can be 
deducted from the purchasing firm's corporate taxes. There is 
also a possibility that this time period and the items targeted 
for inclusion on the list will be expanded. 
  As a measure aimed at lowering the price of photomolding 
system equipment, the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise 
Corporation plans to commence development of related 
technologies on a consignment basis. The budget for this 
undertaking is expected to total &yen;800 million covering a 
four-year period beginning in FY94. 
  On the industry side, a Photomolding Industry Association 
was officially launched on January 26, 1994, with a total 
membership of 57. This group will not only promote photomolding 
systems, but will encourage RP&amp;M activities in general. 
  Membership is comprised of representatives from photomolding 
equipment and resin manufacturers and users, CAD vendors, 
peripheral equipment makers and researchers, who plan to engage 
in technology exchange and research and development work, as 
well as activities designed to certify what equipment falls 
under the purview of the above-mentioned high-tech tax system. 
<H5>  Copes With Future Shortages of Skilled Workers and Cuts </H5>
Processing Time Roughly in Half 
  Ideally, a manufacturer can construct a system such as the 
one put together by Nakashima Propeller which automatically 
creates 3D CAD data, but in actuality, often the product in 
question makes this impossible. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' 
Mihara Works is also utilizing plastic models in place of wooden 
patterns, but they must input 3D CAD data into the photomolding 
system by hand from the drawings.[.sup]3)[/] Even so, they 
claim the results have been significant. 
  The Mihara Works installed a photomolding system into its 
operations in May, 1992, to produce plastic models in place of 
the wooden patterns the plant had had to rely on up until that 
time. Of course, a certain amount of knowledge concerning how to 
read drawings is required, but even employees who have only been 
with the company a year can input 3D CAD data into the company's 
photomolding system. 
  The 3D CAD data required by the photomolding system can be 
obtained from verifications of casting system plans, mass 
calculations and shape studies. There are also occasions where 
scale models are produced for use in design work. The plant also 
studied assembly processes based on 3D CAD. 
  Up until the plant installed the photomolding system, the 
preparation of most wooden patterns was assigned to specialists. 
However, with the growing shortage of skilled technicians, the 
plant found itself in a situation where it couldn't meet 
delivery dates even when its employees worked on weekends and 
holidays. And when they tried consigning their wooden pattern 
production work to outside firms, even "urgent" orders took 
around 10 days to get back. Their photomolding system cuts this 
time in half, to five days turnaround time. 
  Hiroaki Sano, chief of the Casting &amp; Forging Section of 
the 
Machine Department, stated that when they were considering 
installing equipment for the production of models, "We couldn't 
decide whether to go with NC machine tools or a photomolding 
system." Their reasons for choosing the photomolding system 
were: (1) No need for skilled technicians; (2) Even hollow 
shapes can be integrally formed; (3) Unmanned operation 
capabilities make it possible to effectively use nighttime hours 
and days off (for short delivery times); and (4) The same shaped 
models can be produced over and over again. 
  The final analysis was that NC machine tools were more 
troublesome to operate than a photomolding system from the 
standpoint of having to change tools and work. 
<H5>  Dimension Accuracy Above Specs and Increased Strength With </H5>
Fluororesin-Coated Sheets 
  The photomolding system being used at the Mihara Works can 
produce plastic models up to 850 x 600 x 500mm in size. Models 
larger than this are produced in several parts, which are then 
joined together when they are attached to the plates. 
  As for the dimensional accuracy of these plastic models, 
according to Chief Sano, "The plastic models exhibit around half 
the errors allowed by the precision specifications for the 
castings, and are more than satisfactory as replacements for 
precision casting wooden patterns." Metal shrinkage and sand 
mold deformation greatly affect precision. But plastic models 
turned out via the photomolding system exhibit little change 
over time, and can be taken out and used after six months in 
storage with no problems. There have been cases recorded where 
the same plastic models were used between 100-200 times. 
  To cut back on the expense of the raw materials used in 
plastic models, honeycomb structures are employed. The surface 
layer of these models is about 1mm in thickness. If this surface 
layer is made any thinner, molding time and material costs might 
be reduced even further, but model strength could not be 
maintained. 
  When it comes to repairing broken plastic models or revising 
their shapes, excess parts can be cut off and fast curing resins 
used to fill in cracks and depressions, and the repaired/revised 
area can then be coated with a photocuring resin. This 
photocuring resin will harden up with exposure to sunlight. 
  A few techniques being used to enhance the strength of 
plastic models include thermal spraying aluminum (Al) and 
pasting a fluororesin-coated sheet on the surface of the model. 
Chief Sano says that applying these measures "Extends the 
service life of the plastic models longer than that for wooden 
patterns." 
  Since the costs involved in thermal spraying are quite high, 
this technique is not used that often, but fluororesin-coated 
sheets are employed all the time. These sheets not only improve 
strength, but also add to the surface precision of the plastic 
models. 
  Thus far, fluororesin-coated sheets have been used on wooden 
patterns in place of mold-releasing agents. This is because the 
long service life of these sheets helps hold costs down. 
  For example, the same model is used to produce 200 sand 
molds. Ordinarily, a mold-releasing agent would have to be 
re-applied to the pattern or model about once every five times, 
or roughly 40 times during the course of turning out the 200 
molds. But a fluororesin-coated sheet is applied once and can be 
used for all 200 operations. This cuts costs by roughly one-half. 
  And since the sheets offer better releasability vis-a-vis 
casting sand than mold-releasing agents, you can get by without 
allowing for a large draft. This reduces pads, and helps lighten 
weight and reduce the amount of raw materials used. Techniques 
are also being used whereby these sheets are only pasted to 
those areas where mold-releasing agents peel off easily. 
<H5>  Molding Simple Shapes to Increase Rate of Operation </H5>
  At the Mihara Works, roughly 18,000 man-hours are put in per 
month on casting models. The photomolding system is operated 
approximately 300 hours a month, but since it possesses twice 
the productivity, these 300 hours are equivalent to roughly 600 
man-hours put into producing wooden patterns. The photomolding 
system therefore accounts for one-thirtieth of the overall 
monthly man-hours spent on casting models at Mihara Works. 
Because the photomolding system is being used primarily to turn 
out small-size models, in terms of numbers of models produced 
per month, photomolding accounts for between 20-30 percent of 
the total. 
  Producing small, intricately-shaped models by photomolding 
costs less than with wooden patterns. Therefore, there are times 
when the simply-shaped portions of large-sized models are 
constructed of wood, while the smaller, more complicated parts 
of these models are photomolded. 
  Let's compare the cost of producing molds using wooden 
patterns and plastic models on differently shaped objects, using 
as examples brake covers and cylinders. The volume of the brake 
cover is roughly five times that of the cylinder, but the shape 
of the cylinder is significantly more complex. 
  Manufacturing these brake parts using conventional wooden 
patterns cost 260,000 for the covers and 260,000 for the 
cylinders. Producing the same parts using photomolded plastic 
models cost 200,000 for the covers, but only 135,000 for the 
cylinders. 
  The cost of the resins used to make the plastic models 
increases proportionally to the volume of the model, thus 
working out to 75,000 for the covers and just 16,000 for the 
cylinders. In addition to raw materials costs, producing a 
plastic model prototype also involves depreciation costs, 
energy, laser wear and tear and personnel expenses. 
  From the standpoint of production time, it took 90 hours to 
construct the wooden pattern for the brake covers and 135 hours 
to put together the brake cylinder wooden pattern. The cylinder 
pattern took considerably longer to produce. If we do not count 
CAD data preparation time and look only at the molding time 
required by the photomolding system, we see that it took 49 
hours to produce the cover model and just 45.7 hours to turn out 
the cylinder model. Photomolding required less time to do the 
cylinder model than the cover model. 
  These findings indicate that complex shapes have a big 
impact on the time required to produce the wooden patterns for 
them. Naturally, this increases the costs involved in the 
process as well. We also learned that the greater the volume of 
the product, the longer it takes to produce a photomolded 
plastic model for it, but that complex shapes have little or no 
affect on model production time using the photomolding system. 
Thus, the more complex the shape involved, the greater the 
merits of using the photomolding system. 
  However, if this were the only criteria used to choose 
between wooden patterns or photomolded plastic models, the 
operation ratio of the photomolding system would probably drop 
and the per-model costs of producing plastic models would most 
likely increase in accordance with the types of orders received. 
This in turn could lead to a vicious cycle wherein the criteria 
used to determine the shapes for which plastic models are most 
effective become increasingly strict. To avoid this situation, 
the Mihara Works raises the operation ratio of its photomolding 
system equipment by producing whenever possible plastic molds 
even for simple shapes that could just as quickly be done by 
hand (wooden patterns). 
  This approach has other advantages as well, one being the 
shortening of delivery times. And contrary to wooden patterns, 
the in-house quality control procedures required for photomolded 
plastic models are easy to carry out. 
<H5>  Rapid Response to Frequent Shape Changes and Fewer </H5>
Misunderstandings Concerning Perceived Shapes 
  Nihon Morex, a manufacturer of connectors (headquarters in 
Machida-shi, Tokyo), is employing a photomolding system to turn 
out prototypes for submission to its customers. In developing 
connectors for consumer electrical appliances and equipment in 
particular, the shapes of these connectors undergo numerous 
changes from order-receipt to commencement of mass production, 
and the photomolding system is very effective at dealing with 
these frequent shape changes. 
  Connectors for use on consumer products come in an infinite 
number of different shapes, and are generally produced on the 
basis of specifications dictated by customers at order 
placement. Below is a brief explanation of what the work flow 
from order placement through mass production looked like in the 
past. 
  Based on specifications provided by the customer at order 
placement, Nihon Morex designers would put together product 
drawings tailored to satisfy these specifications. Once the 
customer had checked and approved these drawings, then 
prototyping began. 
  Prototypes can be divided into two major types. These are 
prototypes for studying shapes and for confirming functions. 
Prototypes for studying the shape of a product are almost always 
produced singly, while prototypes for checking out the functions 
of a product need to be turned out in larger numbers and require 
metal molds. There are times when both types of prototypes are 
manufactured simultaneously. 
  In the past, since solid, three-dimensional shapes were 
created based on two-dimensional data in the form of 
orthographic projections, shapes were often changed following 
the manufacture of the prototype. The reasons for these shape 
changes included engineering changes made by the customer and 
different perceptions of the final shape held by the customer 
and Nihon Morex, as well as design and manufacturing errors. 
  Despite the fact that connectors come in relatively straight 
shapes, it is very difficult to describe all the data involved 
in drawings. This results in differences between the shape the 
customer has in mind, and the shape envisioned by the designers 
based on the specifications. The shape envisioned by the 
designers based on the specs often also differs from the shape 
imagined by the customers after looking at the drawings. 
  Because these kinds of misunderstandings existed, claims 
were often made whenever Nihon Morex showed the customer the 
prototype, and Nihon Morex would have to redo the prototype a 
number of times until the customer was satisfied. There were 
occasions in the past when the company had to redo prototypes as 
many as eight or nine times. It normally takes about a week to 
produce a single prototype, but it can be done in two to three 
days with five to six engineers working overtime on it. 
  And when a large number of prototypes are needed for 
functional testing, the patterns or molds for these prototypes 
must be prepared. This can take between three to four weeks, 
with two to three weeks required just for the pattern parts. 
This time-consuming process must be undertaken every time there 
is a shape or other change to the original specs. 
  With the photomolding system, however, it only takes one 
night to prepare the required shape. And when a prototype of the 
same plastic material as the product is needed for functional 
inspections, the plastic model produced using the photomolding 
system is transferred to a silicon mold and vacuum-casting is 
carried out. The process is completed in two to three days. 
  Nihon Morex has developed a system for rapidly producing 
plastic models reflecting shape changes. The company's sales 
representatives now carry notebook-style personal computers 
around with them with drawings of client products stored in 
memory. When a customer dictates a shape change to a visiting 
sales representative, the sales representative inputs this data 
directly into the digitalized drawings of the original design 
stored in the PC's memory and immediately transmits that revised 
drawing over public telephone lines to the company. 
  And whereas customers used to have to confirm their 
specifications based on drawings alone, the photomolding system 
now enables the company to provide its customers with plastic 
models at the initial stage of the process, a development which 
has drastically reduced the number of shape changes made by 
customers. What used to require eight to nine shape changes, now 
can be accomplished with as few as two to three changes. The 
shortening of prototype production time and the reduction of 
changes has had a considerable impact on Nihon Morex operations. 
  For instance, customers are not about to delay the start of 
their mass production operations because their connector 
supplier can't meet its delivery deadline. Prior to installing 
the photomolding system, Nihon Morex engineers had to put in 
considerable overtime producing prototypes as delivery times 
drew near. 
  Nihon Morex has taken a number of measures aimed at taking 
full advantage of its photomolding systems capabilities. For 
instance, in order to produce a high precision model, the 
company has deliberately lowered the output of the laser by 
inserting a glassplate in the laser path. This has improved the 
level of precision from what used to be 0.1mm to 0.05mm. 
  As a result of enhanced precision and improved resins, pins, 
terminals and other metal parts can now be inserted into the 
plastic models. Prior to these improvements, plastic models 
often broke when metal parts were inserted into them, 
prohibiting the functional testing of these plastic models under 
the same conditions as the finished product operates in. 
  Nihon Morex also purchased a special American-made software 
package for US$500 that automatically produces the shapes of the 
supports. (Parts required to support those parts suddenly thrust 
out when producing solid models by stacking sections. The 
location and shape of these supports depends on the stacking 
direction.) When the user inputs the three-dimensional shape and 
stacking directions of the model and the material value of the 
resin, this software produces the minimum support in the optimum 
location. This support is made to bend at the touch of a finger, 
making follow-up processing extremely easy. 
<H5>  Reduced Annual Prototype Expenses by 100 Million; System </H5>
Expanded for Common Use of All Departments. 
  After installing and using a photomolding system to produce 
prototypes for one year, Toyota Motor Corporation "reduced its 
prototyping expenses by 100 million," according to Akihide 
Kobayashi, a foreman in the Coordination Department, Engine 
Development and Engineering Division No. 1, Vehicle Development 
Center IV. TMC produced 66 different types of molds for a total 
of 212 molds in all during that one-year period.[.sup]4)[/] 
  This figure was arrived at by totalling up the difference 
between the costs of producing prototypes using the photomolding 
system and the postulated costs of producing prototypes of the 
same shapes using conventional methods. This figure did not take 
into account such secondary effects as shortened development 
time and reduced numbers of engineering changes. 
  TMC installed the photomolding system in its engine design 
division in 1990. TMC worked together with the manufacturer of 
the system to develop an enhanced version capable of turning out 
models larger than those possible with off-the-shelf 
photomolding systems so that TMC could use this system to 
produce all the prototypes required by the engine design 
division. 
  The prototypes produced using the photomolding system are 
reportedly used to confirm shapes that cannot be satisfactorily 
checked using 3D CAD alone, to confirm mountability and to study 
the intake parts required for comparative testing. Foreman 
Kobayashi claims that the photomolding-produced prototypes are 
"especially effective for visualizing air intake flows." 
  In the past, the prototypes produced for visual testing 
purposes were constructed of acrylics and polycarbonates. It 
cost several million yen to produce just one of these 
prototypes. Depending on the shape of the prototype, there were 
instances where they could only be made with channels or 
passages inside rectangular parallelepiped, which meant that 
intake flows were not visible from all angles. 
  When TMC uses its photomolding system, it reportedly 
estimates molding expenses at 10,000/hour, which includes the 
time required for everything from data preparation to molding 
and follow-up processing, and after making comparisons with 
other prototyping methods, advises its engineers. 
  When TMC produces a prototype for visual testing, it 
acquires a clear understanding of just what degree of precision 
is needed for which parts, and what is required in terms of 
surface processing, such as support removal and polishing. This 
enables the company to manufacture a product without engaging in 
extra and unnecessary work. For this reason, even though they 
have an order (specifications) in hand, the designers always 
meet with the engineers in charge of molding. 
  The photomolding system can fall victim to abuse. Because 
the photomolding system makes it possible to produce prototypes 
faster and cheaper than conventional methods, there is a 
tendency to turn out more plastic models than are really 
necessary. Although one approach calls for making the most of 
the special features of these plastic models to carry out more 
studies than was possible in the past, desktop studies are often 
just as beneficial. 
  TMC has therefore implemented a follow-up survey to 
determine whether or not the plastic models produced using the 
photomolding system are actually being put to use. This survey 
program is designed to put a halt to the unnecessary production 
of plastic models. And to lower unit costs, the company is also 
striving to utilize a single plastic model in numerous studies. 
  TMC purchased a second photomolding system at the beginning 
of 1993, and has created a system whereby the chassis, body and 
other divisions can simultaneously use this system together with 
the designers in the engine division. This had evolved from the 
fact that the engine division had been asked in the past by 
other divisions to produce molds for them, and because the 
advantages of the photomolding system have been recognized by 
all of the company's other divisions. The knowhow needed to 
operate the system is passed on to each new section that is set 
up, and TMC says that its photomolding systems are now operating 
5,000 hours a year. 
<H5>  Consigning Model Production to Outside Firms </H5>
  Because photomolding system equipment is so expensive, if a 
company cannot assure a certain rate of operation, then its 
investment will not prove effective and the cost of model 
production will be high. And to operate a photomolding system 
effectively also requires 3D CAD data and molding knowhow. 
  For these reasons, numerous manufacturers opt to contract 
with outside firms to have their models produced for them. What 
does it cost to have models produced outside? There are 
basically two ways of calculating these costs. The first 
involves calculating unit costs on an hourly basis (hourly 
rates) for each process, such as CAD input, molding, etc., and 
the second calculates costs based on the volume of the model 
being produced. 
  One manufacturer who uses a photomolding system to produce 
plastic models on a consignment basis determines his costs in 
the following manner. 
  First, this maker charges a basic fee of 30,000 per job. In 
addition, it then establishes the hourly costs for each of four 
processes -- 3D CAD data input, slice data preparation and other 
data processing work, molding and follow-up processing, such as 
removing supports, etc. 
  Molding expenses include equipment depreciation costs, laser 
wear and tear expenses, the cost of raw materials, utilities 
charges, personnel expenses and site rental fees. 
  The hourly rate for CAD input is 10,000, data processing 
costs 5,000 an hour, molding is 20,000 and follow-up processing 
runs 5,000 per hour. For example, if CAD input and molding each 
takes 10 hours, and data processing and follow-up processing 
each require two hours, then the final bill, including basic 
fee, will work out to 350,000. 
  Costs cannot be arrived at this simply for complex shapes 
and/or when detailed processing is required. But costs can be 
held down somewhat if the company contracting for the production 
of the model produces the slice data in-house. 
<H5>  3D CAD Is a Necessity; Goal Is Improved Overall Efficiency </H5>
  When using a photomolding system, the time required to input 
data can be shortened if 3D CAD data is prepared right from the 
initial stages of the design process. 
  The Sony Corporation is pushing forward simultaneously with 
the promotion of 3D CAD and the use of a photomolding system. 
The company applies 3D CAD to the development of specific 
products, then makes use of that data in its computer-aided 
engineering (CAE) and photomolding system operations. Sony says 
this enables it to evaluate any problems and the measures to 
deal with them, and the effectiveness of each of these tools. 
  Sony's System Development Section, which falls under the 
Research and Development Department, Production Engineering 
Development Division, is in charge of operating the photomolding 
system, and produces plastic models requested by Sony's other 
divisions. Since actual costs would be too high if calculated in 
detail, the System Development Section calculates the cost of 
operating the system at roughly 10,000 an hour. But Hiroshi 
Harimaya, manager of that section, says that "There are also 
times when the cost is set at the figure given by the requesting 
division." 
  The company expects operating costs to drop once utilization 
of the system increases, the rate of operation goes up and 
operating knowhow is accumulated. Until then, Sony feels it is 
has to turn a blind eye, at least to a certain degree, towards 
test period operating costs. 
  If a company is capable of using a photomolding system to 
its full potential in-house, then installing such a system on 
these terms is one possible approach. However, for small- and 
medium-sized companies, it is quite likely that even if they 
introduced a photomolding system into their operations, it would 
lie idle much of the time. 
  For these companies, better approaches to making use of 
photomolding systems might be to get together with other 
like-minded firms to purchase and use a photomolding system on a 
group basis, and or to take advantage of firms that undertake 
the production of plastic models on a consignment basis. These 
latter approaches would not afford the opportunity to accumulate 
operation knowhow, but firms would still be able to acquire 
knowledge on the capabilities of photomolding systems in the 
area of applications. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Photomolding systems have a variety of applications, but 
more often than not, if a company tries to use a system in too 
many different ways, it will not acquire the skills and knowhow 
necessary to utilize it well in any one of them. This is because 
the degree of precision, strength and production time differ for 
each application. And those users who are benefiting the most 
from their photomolding systems have come up with numerous 
schemes to enable them to master the operation of these systems. 
  In the future, as users increase in numbers, equipment 
prices drop and 3D CAD comes into more widespread use, it should 
become a lot easier for companies to install photomolding 
systems. When this happens, the key to the successful use of 
these systems will lie in steadily building up experience and 
coming up with ways of utilizing these systems that are tailored 
to the company's operations.

  The first company in the world to market photomolding 
systems 
was 3D Systems of the U.S.[.sup](a)[/] Most of the 
photomolding systems in operation in the U.S. were produced by 
this company. 
  As a result, a variety of RP&amp;M equipment, other than 
photomolding systems, is now being proposed and developed in the 
U.S. And a number of these equipment can also be purchased here 
in Japan. 
  There are also numerous manufacturers marketing photomolding 
systems in Japan. These include 3D Systems, Electro-Optical 
Systems (EOS) of Germany and a number of Japanese manufacturers. 
  Most of these systems make use of helium-cadmium (He-Cd) or 
argon (Ar) laser devices. There is only one system that utilizes 
a semiconductor laser, and that is the SLP produced by Denken 
Engineering headquartered in Oita-shi.[.sup](b)[/] The 
development of a resin that cures (hardens) in the semiconductor 
laser wavelength region was the impetus behind this system. The 
SLP is both compact and inexpensive. 
  Another system scheduled for marketing by Ushio Electric 
this 
year is also compact and relatively inexpensive. This system 
uses a He-Cd laser, but achieves compact size by reducing 
output. Scanning speed is slow, however, and molding takes a 
long time. 
  Let us briefly explain some of the other molding methods. 
The 
Solider by Cubital of Israel employs a photocured resin, but 
uses a different layer-curing method. Without performing a 
laser-scanning operation, this equipment produces a sectional 
form mask using electrostatic force and exposes this mask to 
ultraviolet lamps. 
  Wax is then filled into the gaps created after unhardened 
resin has been removed, and the surface is scraped flat. Then a 
new coat of resin is applied on top of this, and the next layer 
is exposed. 
  The Sinterstation manufactured by DTM of the U.S. operates 
like a photomolding system, producing each layer by scanning it 
with a laser. A thermoplastic powdered resin is employed as the 
raw material, and new supplies are needed for each layer. The 
total amount of resin to be used is heated to near melting prior 
to processing, and then the sectional forms are fused and 
sintered by scanning them with a CO[.sub]2[/] laser. 
  The Stratasys Co. of the U.S. uses thermoplastic resin in 
its 
3D MODELER and FDM, too, but supplies this resin in the shape of 
a wire. The resin is fused by means of a nozzle that moves 
three-dimensionally, and pressure is used to discharge the model. 
  The LOM produced by the Helisys Co. of the U.S. bonds 
together paper and resin sheets coated with thermoplastic 
adhesives by subjecting them to heat and pressure. The contour 
lines of the sectional forms are cut using a CO[.sub]2[/] 
laser. And finally, to facilitate the removal of margins, the 
LOM also produces grid-like cut lines. 
  Kira Tekkojo (headquartered in Kira-machi, Aichi Prefecture) 
is the only Japanese manufacturer to develop an RP&amp;M device 
other than a photomolding system. The Kira system also employs 
paper layers. Thermoplastic powdered resin is only used on the 
sectional forms of the model, being attached via electrostatic 
force and bonded using a hot press. A cutter is used to put 
notches in the model for the contour lines and 
margins.[.sup](c)[/] The company plans to commence marketing 
this system in March 1994. 
  Generally speaking, molding time can be calculated from the 
time required to produce a single layer and the thickness of the 
layers. In the case of photomolding systems, the time needed to 
produce a single layer depends on laser scanning speed and spot 
diameter. It also takes time to move the plastic model up and 
down to get ready for the next layer. 
  However, mechanically-speaking, no matter how much 
laser-scanning time is shortened, there will still be limits 
placed on this process by the sensitivity of the resin, laser 
output and layer thickness. And the precision of the model will 
depend on what portions of the layer are hardened in what order, 
and at what scanning speed and spot diameter. This aspect of the 
process is dependent on control software. 
  RP&amp;M equipment come in a variety of different systems, 
and 
even photomolding systems are characterized by stacking 
direction and laser method. Right now, photomolding systems are 
head and shoulders above the other RP&amp;M systems when it 
comes to 
actual usage, but we could see these other systems come into 
more widespread use in future.

  [Text] Concept cars and elemental technologies exhibited at 
the 30th Tokyo Motor Show, which was meant to give some idea of 
automobiles of the near future, proved that the preparation of 
material technology required for auto manufacturing had been 
making steady progress. As a result, it was clearer than ever 
that automobile materials would be the key technology for 
simultaneously solving the problems of weight reduction, fuel 
conservation and recycling for automobiles. Effective solutions 
for the urgent issues of weight reduction and fuel conservation 
were shown, while steady progress was demonstrated for elemental 
technologies that seek long-term solutions for the recycling of 
auto materials, including resins for bumpers. 
  This report concerning the Motor Show consists of two parts: 
material technology highlights concerning concept cars and 
elemental technologies shown at the Show are reported in the 
first part, whereas material utilization trends for future auto 
manufacturing are compiled in the second part on the basis of 
interviews with engineers in charge of the material technology 
departments of auto manufacturers. 
  It appears inevitable that the 1993 production for Japanese 
automobile manufacturers will have negative growth for the third 
consecutive year. According to the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers Association, Inc., the 1992 automobile (four-wheel 
vehicle) production in Japan was 12.5 million, which was 5.6 
percent below the 1991 production, resulting in negative growth 
for the second consecutive year. In 1993, the probable annual 
production figure is not expected to reach the 12 million level, 
and each automaker is struggling to make the production schedule 
adjustment. 
  Under these severe sales and production conditions, the 30th 
Tokyo Motor Show was held for 14 days, from 23 October through 5 
November 1993, at the Japan Convention Center (Makuhari Messe) 
in Chiba City, and auto component makers hoped that the Show 
would spur their sales. Automakers, on the other hand, were 
concentrating on the exhibit of "actual cars" currently on the 
market, in an attempt to ring up more sales. 
  Although the focus was on the exhibit of the real cars, the 
Show presented many other interesting items that hinted at what 
kind of automobiles we could expect in the near future in terms 
of concept cars and technology. These items uniquely reflected 
the current times when R&amp;D outlays must be spent effectively, 
and many of them were still searching for the opportunity to 
commercialize. Compared with the 29th Tokyo Motor Show of 
1991[.sup]1[/] in which several possibilities for near-future 
technologies had been presented, the 1993 Show had many exhibits 
that clearly revealed what automaker R&amp;D or Design 
departments 
thought to be their first choice for commercialization. Thus, it 
was easy for a viewer to clearly understand the philosophy and 
strategy of each auto-manufacturing company. 
  For example, both RAUM of Toyota Motor Corp. and AQ-X of 
Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., were the so-called concept cars with the 
catch phrase of "Compact sedans of tomorrow with roomy interior 
space." Nissan explained that AQ-X was created with the same 
overall length as that of the compact car Primera, the same 
interior space as that of the luxury-class car President, and 
the same fuel consumption rate as that of the popular model, 
Sunny. Both Toyota's and Nissan's concept cars demonstrated how 
a city-driven, near-future sedan should be made. 
  In the first part of this report, the future material 
technologies that were incorporated in concept cars and the 
elemental technologies at the exhibit will be discussed under 
the three categories of "Auto Bodies," "Engines," and "Electric 
Cars." 
<H5>  Auto Bodies </H5>
<H5>  Mazda Adopts Easy-Disassembly Construction, Arranges Various </H5>
Components in Functional Units 
  Mazda Motor Corp. exhibited the HR-X2, with a rotary engine 
using hydrogen gas as fuel. The unique features of this concept 
car included a hydrogen-gas-burning, rotary engine system and a 
design incorporating both easy-disassembly vehicular 
construction and outer and inner panels made of a recyclable, 
"liquid crystal polymer fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) material." 
  Koji Tobita, section chief researcher of the Mazda Technical 
Research Institute, who oversaw the development of this concept 
car, says this: "We developed the HR-X2's body with the idea of 
making the entire car recyclable." The chassis incorporates 
modular design, and each functional module is unitized. 
  The basic vehicular structure for the HR-X2 has the chassis, 
the power train (including the engine and the drive mechanism), 
and the fuel tank arranged together in the so-called 
under-chassis section, which can be readily separated from the 
resin-made "upper body," which is located above the 
under-chassis section. 
  Like the other units, the front functional unit is uniquely 
designed. The front functional unit consists of head lamps and 
wipers that are situated below the front cowl for easy removal 
of a wire harness in disassembly through minimization of 
electrical wiring, plus an instrument panel guard that 
incorporates the steering wheel, a shift lever, and an 
air-conditioner. 
  The rear functional unit is designed in a similar fashion. 
The unit incorporates a high-mount stoplight, speakers for an 
audio system, and an air cleaner. 
  In the center console unit, audio equipment and the 
air-conditioner are controlled by an optically transmitted 
remote system, and light is reflected on interior mirrors to 
eliminate interior lights altogether, in order to circumvent the 
complicated job of removing a wire harness for disassembly. 
<H5>  Adoption of Recyclable Liquid Crystal Polymer FRP </H5>
  Among the unique features of the recyclable, 
easy-to-disassemble auto body construction, perhaps the adoption 
of a liquid-crystal polymer FRP attracted the most attention 
from material engineers. The FRP is used for the outer panels, 
as well as inner panels, of the front hood, both front and rear 
fenders, the trunk lid, the cab, the doors, and the center 
console. As a result, according to Mr. Tobita, Mazda expects to 
be able to recycle "almost 100 percent of the upper body 
section." 
  At the show, however, Mazda exhibited ordinary glass 
fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) outer and inner panels instead. 
There was only one example of the liquid crystal polymer FRP 
exhibited among other components, in the form of a test-produced 
unit combining the rear fender with rear pillars. 
  In 1992, Mazda announced that it had essentially completed 
the development of this particular liquid crystal FRP, in which 
a thermoplastic resin is reinforced with microfine liquid 
crystal polymer fibers. The idea was to reconstitute the 
reinforcement mechanism of the liquid crystal polymer microfine 
fibers by remelting a recycled raw material in a pulverized 
state in the process of injection or compression 
molding.[.sup]2[/] This time, a "nylon-based material (PA, or 
polyamide) was used as the thermoplastic resin to make the 
liquid crystal polymer FRP." 
  Mazda designed the body of the HR-X2 with a lightweight, 
highly rigid structure using a cross-sectional element of 
glue-bonded outer and inner liquid crystal polymer FRP panels. 
This body construction for the HR-X2 was the only change made by 
Mazda from that of the AZ-1.[.sup]3[/] 
  Another feature of the HR-X2 that drew the attention of the 
visitors at the Show was its excellent air resistance 
coefficient, C[.sub]d[/] = 0.3 -- an index of the body's 
aerodynamic resistance -- despite its bulky, box-like shape. 
Mazda's explanation was this: "Air resistance was minimized by 
dividing the air flow that hits the body into the upper and 
lower components by means of troughs attached to the sides of 
the body." 
  The trend of reducing a car's fuel cost through the 
reduction 
of air resistance is also evident in concept compact cars of 
other auto companies. For example, Nissan's AQ-X also boasts 
C[.sub]d[/] = 0.28, and it is equipped with aerodynamic 
parts, including front and rear aero-bumpers, and a CAE-designed 
(computer-applied-engineering) underside of the floor to 
optimize air flow across the underside. 
<H5>  Nissan Solves Contact Corrosion Problem of Aluminum/Steel </H5>
With Aluminum/Steel Cladding 
  The unique feature of Nissan's AQ-X is the adoption of an 
"iron-aluminum hybrid body structure" by using an aluminum alloy 
for certain structural components and for the outer and inner 
panels for its doors, front hood, front fenders, and trunk lid. 
Instead of the aluminum alloy that is not suitable for 
deep-drawing molding, steel sheets are used for the outer and 
inner panels of the rear fender which has a severely curved 
surface. As a result of adopting the iron-aluminum hybrid body 
structure, the weight of the AQ-X is approximately 20 percent 
less than that of previous bodies made of steel outer panels. 
This drastic weight reduction seems to indicate that the 
adoption of the hybrid structure is expected to meet future auto 
specifications, since, according to one official, no matter how 
much a body structure is rationalized, "the weight of the 
existing steel body will be reduced only by several percent at 
best." 
  Generally, whenever sheet-steel and aluminum-alloy parts are 
used together, the joints are attacked by corrosion that results 
from the contact of dissimilar metals. The corrosion is commonly 
called "galvanic corrosion," and such joints have to be avoided 
altogether in auto body construction. Therefore, auto body parts 
in which aluminum alloys can be used are limited to such parts 
as front hoods, trunk lids, and hinged parts that function as a 
lid, such as quickly detachable sun roofs. Otherwise, like the 
NSX sports car of Honda Motor Co., Ltd., all the body has to be 
made with an aluminum alloy, with only the smallest area of 
contact with steel. 
  Nissan solved the problem of contact corrosion between steel 
and aluminum alloy for the AQ-X by inserting steel/aluminum 
alloy cladding pieces in the joints. The steel/aluminum alloy 
cladding pieces are inserted between an aluminum alloy outer 
panel and a steel inner panel when they are to be spot-welded to 
form a monocoque body. The aluminum alloy layer of the cladding 
piece is in direct contact with the aluminum outer panel, and 
the steel layer of the cladding piece is in direct contact with 
the steel inner panel, before the entire assembly is 
spot-welded. As a result, aluminum is welded to aluminum, and 
steel is welded to steel. As a whole, the aluminum outer panel 
and the steel inner panel are bonded to each other. 
  Nissan is using the same cold-rolled steel panel SPCD-SPCE 
as 
that currently in use and the aluminum-magnesium-based alloy No. 
5000, commonly called "30-30" (i.e., tensile strength of 300 MPa 
or 30 kgf/mm[.sup]2[/] and elongation of 30 percent), for the 
inner and outer panels, respectively. Only one spot-welding 
voltage is required for spot-welding steel to steel, as well as 
aluminum to aluminum. Yoshitaka Kurihara, chief researcher at 
the Vehicular Research Laboratory of Nissan's General Research 
Institute, says this: "We chose the ratio of the aluminum alloy 
to the steel in the cladding material in such a way that one 
voltage can do both welding jobs simultaneously." 
  Cladding materials have two atomic layers of dissimilar 
metals arranged tightly next to each other, so no air can 
infiltrate between the two layers; thus, neither oxidation nor 
reduction takes place. As a result, no potential difference is 
generated between the steel and aluminum-alloy layers, and that 
prevents any corrosion process from taking place between the two 
dissimilar metals. 
  Nissan improved the body rigidity of the AQ-X through both 
design and material, and, according to Kurihara, "both bending 
and twisting rigidity are 20 percent higher than those of 
previous cars of the same class." Nissan successfully prevented 
any loss of rigidity despite the incorporation of aluminum. The 
gauge of the aluminum-alloy sheet, like that of previous 
aluminum-alloy parts, was made 1.4 times that of the sheet steel 
to maintain the same tensile rigidity as that of a sheet-steel 
body. 
  The separation of steel from aluminum in an auto body, the 
critical process in the recycling of cars to be disposed of, was 
made technically possible by Nissan for the AQ-X. By heating to 
approximately 500C, "a brittle intermetallic compound is 
formed at the interface of the steel and aluminum-alloy layers 
of the cladding material, which makes it easy to separate the 
two layers with light impact." 
  Nissan believes that the iron-aluminum hybrid body structure 
is a weight reduction technology with a high probability of 
implementation, because the advantage of weight reduction can be 
balanced against the added cost through the optimization of the 
ratio of cheap sheet-steel to lightweight aluminum alloy. 
According to Kurihara, as far as the cost problem is concerned, 
although it is difficult to make a thorough assessment at this 
time, "it appears that a certain cost increase is unavoidable." 
Not only does the aluminum alloy cost approximately three times 
as much as the steel (the ratio of the materials' unit prices x 
the ratio of the densities), but the production cost is also 
high for the aluminum alloy, because the spot-welding 
electrode's life is shorter for the alloy than for steel. 
<H5>  Audi Exhibits Space Frame Car With Aluminum Body </H5>
  Germany's Audi Motor Corp. exhibited an Audi Space Frame 
(ASF) car with a space-frame structure assembled with 
aluminum-alloy outer and inner panels. Audi plans to use this 
ASF model for the mass-test-production of the A8, which is to 
replace the currently sold luxury V8. The A8 is scheduled to be 
introduced to the German market in May 1994. 
  Although the price of the A8 has not been announced, it has 
been rumored that the price will exceed the price of the V8 of 
&yen;11.4 million. It is speculated that the car could afford an 
all-aluminum-alloy body because of its high-priced status and 
the moderate production rate of approximately 2,400 vehicles per 
month. Most of today's passenger cars have a monocoque body that 
functions as the structural material for outer and inner panels. 
In contrast, the frame alone of the space-frame structure 
functions as the structural component for the body, and outer 
panels are primarily used as the exterior partition. Therefore, 
the space-frame structure has the advantage of being able to 
maintain rigidity despite the adoption of materials less rigid 
than steel, such as aluminum alloys and resin, for the outer and 
inner panels. 
  Another important advantage of the space-frame structure is 
that it enables the use of comparatively cheaper extruded 
materials for the frame structural component. Extruded materials 
can be made with heavier gauges for use in spots that require 
high rigidity, or they can be made with thinner gauges for use 
in spots that require low rigidity. Furthermore, even if 
sections with insufficient rigidity happen to be constructed in 
a space-frame structure made of extruded frames, the weakness 
can easily be compensated for with stiffening ribs. 
  For the space-frame structure of the ASF car exhibited at 
the 
show, the lowest-cost extruded material was used in the largest 
quantity, the next-lowest-cost die-cast material was used in the 
next-to-largest quantity, and the highest-cost rolled material 
was used in the smallest quantity. However, based on the concept 
disclosed in 1991 in which extruded frame materials were to be 
connected with a die-cast bonding material for the ASF concept 
model, many observers at the show seemed to get the impression 
that the use rate of the extruded material was less than 
previously announced. 
  Audi used an aluminum-manganese-silicon-based alloy for the 
extruded material, and an aluminum-silicon-manganese-based alloy 
for the vacuum die-cast material. What attracted the audience's 
attention is the use of a press-molded rolled sheet material in 
a complex shape for the part called the "C pillar" of the roof 
section of the ASF car body. 
  The chassis of the ASF car was formed by riveting the roof 
and panels, such as doors and fenders, that were made by 
press-molding of aluminum alloy. The panels were riveted, 
instead of spot-welded to produce bond strength that is higher 
by approximately 30 percent and to eliminate the anti-production 
environment element of sparking, which would be caused by 
welding. Approximately 70 percent of the bonding was done with 
riveting; the rest was completed by a combination of 
spot-welding and clinching. The aluminum-alloy materials for the 
ASF car were supplied by an ALCOA Corp. (U.S.) plant in Germany. 
<H5>  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Modifies Rear End With Elastomer </H5>
  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displayed its concept car, which was 
a fourth-generation research experimental car -- the HSR-IV. As 
with the HSR-III of two years ago, Mitsubishi adopted an 
all-plastic body for the HSR-IV, primarily for weight reduction. 
  The PPE/nylon 6 (polypropylene ether/PA or polyamide) alloy, 
a thermoplastic resin capable of withstanding an online baking 
finish temperature (140-160C), was used for vertical outer 
panels, including fenders; and a sheet molding compound was used 
for horizontal outer panels, such as the hood, which requires 
tensile rigidity. 
  Mitsubishi has already developed its body aluminization 
technology to a level capable of mass-production through the 
development of the lightweight, experimental SR-17 car. On the 
other hand, the Material Technology Department of the Passenger 
Car Development Division said this: "We again pursued 
improvement of the resin body, since our resin technology was 
relatively behind." 
  Mitsubishi did not quite solve the problem inherent in 
plastic bodies -- i.e., "the usage of a recyclable, 
thermoplastic resin for horizontal outer panels" -- with the 
HSR-IV. Mitsubishi is said to be "experimenting with a 
multilayer, thermoplastic resin outer sheet in which a foaming 
agent is sandwiched between skin layers, in order to increase 
the sheet gauge to gain sufficient tensile rigidity" without 
sacrificing weight reduction. 
  The most unique feature of the HSR-IV was the elastomer 
"elastic aero-tail" that can tailor the shape of the tail-end 
section to the running conditions in order to modify the 
aerodynamic environment. Under normal conditions, the tail end 
is flat. However, under certain running conditions, the tail end 
rises to form a triangular upheaval, i.e., the upheaval 
functions as an air spoiler that generates a downward force to 
counterbalance the buoyancy the car has under high-speed driving 
conditions. Also, when the car is driven in reverse, the spoiler 
remains down so as to maintain good rear visibility for the 
driver. 
  In fact, a similar mechanism had been incorporated in the 
HSR-III, although, this time, the durability of the elastomer 
was drastically improved, to the level of ready implementation. 
At the same time, Mitsubishi improved the design to make the 
upheaved area smaller. The tail section is covered with a 
skin-like material of a stretchable, "special thermoplastic 
elastomer" to form an upheaval that is smooth and seamless. 
Details of this elastomer have not yet been disclosed, although 
it is said to be "a styrene-based elastomer with maximum 
elongation of 600-800 percent." The key for the elastomer is the 
manifestation of the durability for repetitive stretches. A 
polyolefin-based, thermoplastic resin called TPO -- a blend of 
polypropylene and ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) -- had been 
used for the HSR-III,[.sup]1[/] although the resin was not 
durable enough for the tail section to be commercialized. 
  Sachio Miwa, of the Material Technology Department, says 
that 
this time, Mitsubishi, in its experiments, "achieved an 
elastomer durability that could cope with 3,000-4,000 repetitive 
stretches, which is equivalent to the 10 years of use. 
Therefore," he continues, "it will be possible to commercialize 
the tail section in the next few years." An approximately 
100mm-high upheaval can be repeatedly formed on the tail, with a 
stretch of approximately 300 percent for the elastomer. In 
contrast to ordinary thermoplastic elastomers, which show a 
nearly linear elongation-stress relationship, this particular 
elastomer shows a rubberlike, nonlinear elongation-stress 
relationship by requiring small stress when stretched by less 
than 100 percent and then suddenly increasing the stress 
requirement when elongation exceeds 100 percent. Mitsubishi 
coated the tail with a urethane elastic paint that could stretch 
up to 300 percent in order to be able to cope with the 
elastomer's stretch. 
  According to Miwa, Mitsubishi is "planning other aerodynamic 
improvement uses for this elastomer." For example, he continues, 
"it is possible to have deformable body sections that cover the 
upper halves of tires, so that excellent aerodynamic conditions 
are created when moving straight forward; when parts of the 
tires protrude outside the body in turning situations, the body 
sections alter their shape to accommodate the tires' protrusion." 
<H5>  Water-Repelling Windows Under Evaluation by Mitsubishi, </H5>
Nissan 
  Recently, steady progress has been quietly made in the 
development of new glass in various auto body components. The 
progress made in glass development was demonstrated by the 
water-repelling glass adopted by Mitsubishi and Nissan for the 
windshields of the HSR-IV and the AQ-X, respectively. The 
glasses themselves are said to be "not yet in a fully developed 
stage." 
  Each of the test glasses is being developed jointly by a 
team 
of auto and glass makers for improving the windshield visibility 
on a rainy day. This objective is achieved by coating a glass 
plate with a water-repelling material to form spherical drops of 
rainwater on the glass surface to minimize vision distortion. 
  There are two kinds of water-repelling coating material: 
fluororesin and silicone-based. The problem currently under 
study is the coating's durability, and, in order to 
commercialize such a windshield, "it is absolutely necessary to 
have the durability of the coating nearly equal to that of the 
glass itself," according to Kenichi Tange, the head of 
Mitsubishi's Material Technology Department. Since the coating 
must be made on the outside of the windshield, the coating needs 
to be resistant to peeling due to various frictions and must be 
stable against deterioration caused by ultraviolet light. 
  For the HSR-IV, Mitsubishi adopted a new, water-repelling 
windshield with improved durability in terms of effective water 
repulsion. According to Mitsubishi, the wear resistance of the 
new windshield's water-repelling film "was improved by the 
addition to the film-coating material of a special agent that 
undergoes chemical bonding with silica (SiO[.sub]2[/]), the 
major component of glass." 
  Furthermore, Mitsubishi, which had been trying various 
fluororesin-based coating materials, lowered the molecular 
weight of the resin specifically for application to the HSR-IV 
to increase the apparent concentration of fluorine atoms. The 
higher the fluorine content, the greater the water-repelling 
effect and the greater the stability against light. Mitsubishi 
hopes to be able to commercialize the windshield in the next 
several years. 
  On the other hand, Nissan claims that it is "in the process 
of comparative evaluation of fluorine- and silicone-based 
resins," and it has not yet disclosed the latest composition of 
the coating material. 
<H5>  Highly Radio-Wave-Penetrable UV/IR Cut Glass </H5>
  Nissan adopted a UV (ultraviolet) IR (infrared, or heat ray) 
cut glass for the windows of the AQ-X. This was an attempt to 
protect the driver and passengers from sunlight and to alleviate 
the sunlight's heating effect on interior temperature. Another 
aim will eventually be to lessen the load for the air 
conditioner. 
  Nissan has not yet disclosed the specifics of the glass 
surface treatment, although, it explains, a "metallic 
micropowder is coated on the interior side of the glass." The 
reason for coating the inside of the glass is to minimize 
frictions that may promote peeling of the coating material. 
Although the side window glasses, which may be raised and 
lowered, are not completely free of interior frictions, Hiroaki 
Sasaki, an engineer at the Vehicular Research Laboratory of the 
General Research Institute, says this: "We believe that the 
window glass does not require any maintenance work for the 
sun-screening effect, because this window glass has already 
achieved a durability that corresponds to the vehicle's 
durability in terms of number of years." 
  The coating of the window glass screens the so-called UV-A 
light, i.e., ultraviolet light with wavelengths of 400 to 320 
nm. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 320 nm are 
either screened out by ordinary glass or unable to reach ground. 
Therefore, those rays were not included in the targets of the 
coating. By cutting the transmittance in half, to 30 percent, 
the coating layer is said to be capable of absorbing more 
ultraviolet light or UV-A than can ordinary glass, which 
transmits approximately 60 percent of the rays. 
  However, the screening effect of this coated glass against 
infrared light has room for further improvement. The IR 
transmittance of this glass has not yet been divulged, although 
Nissan claims that "the transmittance level has been 
sufficiently reduced." Generally speaking, when glass is treated 
for UV and IR screening, it also tends to reflect more radio 
waves. For example, in the past, when a rear window glass with a 
printed antenna was treated for IR screening, the performance of 
the antenna tended to deteriorate. According to Nissan, "the new 
UV/IR cut glass can accommodate a printed antenna because the 
glass has high radio-wave-penetrability." 
<H5>  Adoption of Recycled Resin for FRP Bumper Reinforcement </H5>
  Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd. (FHI), came up with an 
interesting proposal for an exterior part. FHI adopted glass 
fiber-reinforced polypropylene (GFRP) for reinforcing the 
bumpers of its concept car, Jasmine, which was developed with 
the theme of promoting conservation of resources and energy and 
alleviating traffic jams. The idea also produced a weight 
reduction effect of the same level as that achieved by the 
aluminum-alloy bumper reinforcement, which has recently become 
the mainstream for bumper construction. 
  The choice of the GFRP permits us to decipher FHI's 
philosophy on resin recycling. The spokesperson from the Design 
Section of FHI Subaru Technical Headquarters says this: "Resins 
have recently been treated badly because of their implications 
in terms of preservation of the environment. Realistically 
speaking, however, some parts of the auto body have to be made 
of resin. In order to be able to recycle resin, some body 
sections or components must be saved for the use of recycled 
resin. We want to propose the GFRP bumper reinforcement as one 
of the most promising components in this category." FHI's 
thinking was that "the bumper reinforcement, which doesn't need 
a high-quality appearance, would be the ideal spot to use 
recycled resin," since the reinforcement is hidden behind the 
bumper fascia. 
<H5>  Engines </H5>
  Attracting the most attention at the Engine Exhibit were 
Nissan's VQ engine, which the developer hopes will become the 
mainstream engine of the late '90s, and Mazda's rotary engine 
system, which is designed to be used for hydrogen-burning cars 
in the future. 
<H5>  Significant Weight Reduction Through Abundant Use of </H5>
Aluminum Alloys for VQ Engine 
  The VQ engine is expected to be installed in ordinary cars 
as 
early as 1994. It is a V-type engine with a displacement of 2-3 
liters. The engine drew attention because it demonstrated how 
much weight reduction, fuel-cost reduction, and exhaust cleaning 
could be improved for the existing gasoline-burning, 
reciprocating engine. 
  Material technology was fully applied in an attempt to 
reduce 
the weight of the engine. Compared with the current VG engine, 
the weight of the cylinder block was reduced by 29 kg, or 50 
percent, in addition to a weight decrease of 5 kg, or 17 
percent, in the primary moving system and a total weight 
decrease of 9 kg, or 19 percent, for the moving valve system 
plus the cylinder heads. 
  The drastic weight reduction of 50 percent for the cylinder 
block was achieved through the replacement of the existing cast 
iron FC with the aluminum alloy ADC 12. The block was molded 
with a high-pressure die-cast machine installed at Iwaki Plant, 
Nissan's designated state-of-the-art engine plant. Although the 
machine is called a die-cast machine, it is a type of 
high-pressure casting method with a slightly low-casting 
pressure of approximately 100 MPa. Today, Honda and Mazda are 
the only automakers that are adopting a high-pressure cast 
aluminum alloy for cylinder blocks. 
  In 1982, Nissan had adopted a high-pressure cast product for 
the cylinder block of the 1-liter displacement engine for the 
then-new model called March. Subsequently, however, Nissan used 
products (made of aluminum alloys, including AC4B) cast with a 
low pressure of approximately 1 MPa for cylinder blocks in its 
campaign for aluminization of large engines. High pressure could 
not be used for casting, because sand molds had to be used to 
form the cooling-water passages. This problem was solved for the 
VQ engine by adopting an open deck-type casting method without 
using the mold. 
  The cylinder block for the VQ engine had been designed by 
CAE 
for rigid construction, as well as for the installation of 
cooling-water passages. Therefore, according to a spokesperson 
for the First Power Train Design Department of the Power Train 
Development Division, although the block "has an intricate shape 
for high-pressure casting, the casting method was chosen as a 
result of optimization with CAE fluid analysis." 
  The ADC 12 high-pressure cast product was also used to make 
the component that unitized the oil pan and the lower crankcase 
situated under the cylinder block. Unlike previous oil pans that 
were placed below the cylinder block merely as an attachment, 
this component also functions as a structural component to 
increase rigidity of the overall engine. Because of this, an 
extra effort was made to decrease the weight of the cylinder 
block. Moreover, the intricately shaped cylinder block was made 
of a low-pressure cast product from AC4B. 
  The ideal way to reduce the weight of an engine is to reduce 
the weight of the moving parts of an engine. When parts that 
undergo reciprocating or rotary motions are made light, not only 
is less driving energy required, but also the energy loss due to 
sliding is reduced. In addition, the engine's revolution limit 
and responsiveness will also increase. Therefore, says Director 
Kenichi Sasaki, of Nissan, "the VQ engine was developed as the 
basic engine model that will be used for the next 15 years." 
  Nissan also succeeded in achieving a drastic weight 
reduction 
of approximately 20 percent for AC8A-made pistons that were made 
in a rational shape created via the full use of CAE in stress 
and heat-flow analyses. 
  Similarly, connecting rods were also made lighter by 
reducing 
the diameters of the pins at their smaller ends, which are 
linked with the pistons. This weight reduction was possible 
because of the reduction in the piston's weight and because of 
the improved fatigue strength that resulted from the creation of 
an appropriate compression stress layer on the rod's surface by 
hard shot peening. 
<H5>  Hydrogen Gas Rotary Car Achieves 230-km Cruising Distance </H5>
  For the last several years, Mazda has been energetically 
developing a near-future engine in the form of a hydrogen-gas 
rotary engine for low-pollution vehicles. The engine at the show 
drew much attention because it may soon be used in combination 
with an improved version of today's gasoline-reciprocating 
engines if low-pollution cars are required to meet 
exhaust-emission regulations of the state of California, in the 
United States. 
  Mazda's HR-X2 concept car, which carries the rotary engine 
(displacement of 2 x 654 cc), achieved a cruising distance of 
230 km at a constant speed of 60 km/h with 43 m[.sup]3[/] 
[normal] of hydrogen gas stored in a fuel tank, which contained 
a hydrogen-occluded alloy. 
  The mass of this hydrogen-occluded alloy-containing fuel 
tank 
is approximately 300 kg, which is about the same as that of a 
battery for an electric vehicle. However, according to Director 
Takanori Minami, "the hydrogen-gas rotary engine car has the 
edge over the electric vehicle because the cruising distance for 
the former is twice that of the 100 km or so for the latter." 
  The hydrogen-occluded alloy is a misch metal/nickel alloy 
(MmNi[.sub]5[/], Mm is a mixture of rare earth metals). This 
alloy, which weighs 18 kg, is packed in a thin, long cell with 
dimensions of approximately 11x7x68 cm. Arranged inside the cell 
with a grid-like cross-section are fins made of extruded No. 
5000 aluminum alloy. Thin pipes for circulating warm and cold 
water are installed at the intersections of the grid formation. 
Both ends of the cells are welded together by tungsten-inert gas 
welding to form a tank. 
  The hydrogen-occluded alloy is heated or cooled by water or 
cold water, using the engine's cooling water, for the desorption 
or absorption of hydrogen gas. A total of 18 cells makes up the 
tank (with the total weight of the alloy being 250 kg), which is 
located on the trunk floor. 
  The rotary engine mounted in the HR-X2 is an improved model 
of the 13B base. The new engine has a higher output as a result 
of a change in the intake process: instead of the simultaneous 
intake of both air and hydrogen, as in the old engine, hydrogen 
gas is injected into the combustion chamber after air has been 
led into it from a separate port. 
  Mazda is "proud of the new engine's performance level, which 
is equal to that of the existing gasoline reciprocating engine," 
with a maximum output-maximum torque of approximately 96,000 
W/170 N/m (130 PS/17.0 kgf/m). 
  Elsewhere, FHI's cylinder sleeve made of an aluminum alloy 
with excellent wear resistance and machinability was also worthy 
of attention. This aluminum alloy was 3HA with a composition of 
Al-14 weight-percent Si, a product of Australia's Comalco Ltd. 
The unique feature of this alloy is the superfine size of 
precipitated intermetallic compound grains, 10 m. 
<H5>  Electric Vehicles </H5>
  At the show, electric vehicle makers exhibited low-pollution 
cars to show their concern for the environment and appeared to 
demonstrate the philosophy that cars of the near future should 
be made differently from current, gasoline-burning, 
reciprocating engine cars. 
  Exhibited at the show were a multitude of electric vehicles, 
including Toyota's EV-50 and Nissan's (Abeniiru) EV, 
representing low-pollution vehicles of the near future. One of 
the factors that have been pushing automakers into the 
development of these electric vehicles is the auto emission 
regulations of the state of California (U.S.) that, starting in 
1994, mandate the step-by-step introduction of low-pollution 
vehicles. 
  According to the regulations, which are the strictest in the 
world, 2 percent of the total number of vehicles to be sold 
must, starting in 1998, consist of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) 
that emit no nonmethane-based organic gas in exhaust. A Toyota 
official says that low-pollution vehicles emerged in force 
because "it will soon be 1998, and we don't have much time to 
evaluate the vehicle's reliability and durability." A 
spokesperson at Honda Technical Research Institute says this: 
"Today, it is the time for us to tell everybody how far we have 
come along technically and how technology can be applied to 
low-pollution vehicles." 
  Today, two types of low-pollution vehicles have been 
proposed: one is an electric automobile that gets its motive 
power from a motor driven by electricity stored in a battery, 
and the other is a hybrid car that is equipped with an internal 
combustion engine to supplement the battery power, so it can run 
with larger output and for a longer cruising distance than the 
electric automobile. From the standpoint of practicality, both 
types require the further development of an efficient battery 
and a motor. At this show, displayed batteries were noteworthy 
for the fact that they seemed to need much further improvement. 
<H5>  Sodium-Sulfur Battery With High Energy Density </H5>
  Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. exhibited the EE-10, which was 
developed within the concept of the "lightweight, hybrid city 
commuter." Intended for city driving, this car normally runs on 
electricity, as well as on a 660-cc methanol engine for 
high-speed, long-distance driving. According to its 
specifications, this car was equipped with a sodium-sulfur 
battery that was under joint development by Yuasa Battery Co., 
Ltd. (Yuasa) (Tokyo) 
  This battery is unique in that it has the highest energy 
density of all the electric car batteries currently 
commercialized or under development. The energy density is an 
index for cruising distance per charging: the greater the energy 
density, the greater the distance the car can travel without 
further charging of the battery. As of now, the energy density 
of a sodium-sulfur battery is 100 Wh/kg, approximately 2.5 times 
that of a lead battery. 
  Theoretically, a sodium-sulfur battery can attain an energy 
density that is "about 10 times that of a lead battery," 
according to a spokesperson at Yuasa's Tokyo Development 
Laboratory. Moreover, the output density of a sodium-sulfur 
battery -- which indicates a car's acceleration capability, 
hill-climbing capability, and maximum speed -- is 150 W/kg, and 
its charging life (the number of tolerable times for repeating 
charging and discharging) is 1,000 times. Both of these numbers 
are comparable with those of a lead battery. 
  The sodium-sulfur battery with the above-described, 
excellent 
performance is constructed like a sandwich rolled into a 
cylindrical form, with a solid electrolyte of _b_-alumina 
(_b_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) between the sodium plate 
anode and the sodium-sulfur (Na[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]x[/]) 
plate cathode. It is claimed that the battery "converts energy 
at 100-percent efficiency, because no side reactions occur" in 
the battery's electrochemical process. 
  This battery has the advantage of undergoing no 
self-discharge and being made of materials that come from 
abundant resources. On the other hand, it is not easy to handle. 
According to the Fire Service Law, sodium and sulfur, which are 
used for the electrodes, are classified under category 3, 
"spontaneously ignitable and water-prohibitive substances," and 
category 2, "combustible solids," respectively. Their uses are 
restricted in that registration with the Fire Defense Agency is 
required when more than a given quantity of either of the two 
materials is handled. In fact, a sodium-sulfur battery was not 
installed in the EE-10 at the show. The Fire Service Law 
prohibited the battery from being brought into the exhibition 
hall. 
  In addition to that problem, technical problems still remain 
with the sodium-sulfur battery. For example, because of its high 
operating temperature of above 300C, the battery needs to 
be heated for charging and needs to be protected from cooling 
while the car is being driven. To solve this temperature 
problem, it will be necessary to develop a heat-insulating 
vessel and a heating mechanism that does not interfere with the 
high energy density, i.e., the low weight, of the sodium-sulfur 
battery. According to the Design Department of Suzuki, 
"sodium-sulfur battery development has just begun. From the 
standpoint of resources, we expect more from this battery than 
from the nickel-based battery, and it will eventually replace 
the lead battery." 
<H5>  Long-Life Nickel-Hydrogen Battery; ZEV-Favorite Lead Battery </H5>
  The "nickel-based battery" is the general name for a group 
of 
batteries that use nickel for the cathode. There are four types 
of nickel-based battery, depending on the composition of the 
anode: cadmium, iron, zinc, and hydrogen-occluded alloys 
(including LaNi[.sub]5[/]). Of those, automakers appear to be 
staying away from Niccad batteries, which used cadmium for the 
anode, because of the metal's toxicity. Of the remaining three, 
the nickel-hydrogen-occluded alloy (nickel-hydrogen) battery is 
currently in the position closest to commercialization, because 
of its excellent balance between energy density, output density, 
and long life. 
  For example, Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. mounted a 
nickel-hydrogen battery in its hybrid car EV Sedan, which has a 
maximum speed of 120 km/h and a cruising distance of 450 km. 
Although details of components of the battery, including the 
hydrogen-occluded alloy, have not been disclosed, its 
performance reportedly includes an energy density of 65 Wh/kg, 
which is 1.5-2 times that of the lead battery, and an output 
density of 170 W/kg, which is 1.5 times that of the lead 
battery. Most remarkable is the battery's life, which is said to 
be "as durable as the car itself, even with daily repetition of 
charging and discharging." 
  Honda also exhibited a nickel-hydrogen battery, which had 
been developed jointly with Matsushita Battery Co., Ltd. 
(Moriguchi City, Osaka Prefecture), and Ovonic Battery Corp., a 
U.S. battery maker. This battery's energy density and output 
density are approximately 60 Wh/kg and 170 W/kg, respectively, 
which are about the same as those for Daihatsu's battery. 
According to Honda's Tochigi Research Institute, however, "the 
battery's life is currently good for only 500 cycles of charging 
and discharging, which we intend to extend to the car's life." 
  Tochigi Research Institute also says this: "It should take 
several more years before this battery can be mass-produced." 
Honda needs to ensure that the excellent performance of a single 
cell will not deteriorate when cells are combined to form a 
module. Furthermore, before the nickel-hydrogen battery can be 
commercialized, "the recovery and re-use technologies for 
hydrogen-occluded alloys must be established," according to 
Tokyo Development Laboratory, Yuasa, and something must be done 
to bring the cost down from what is now approximately 15 times 
that of the lead battery. 
  Still, many problems need to be solved for both 
sodium-sulfur 
and nickel-hydrogen batteries. Automakers, particularly Nissan 
and Honda, seem to have the opinion that "lead batteries are 
suitable for ZEVs from the standpoint of reliability, safety, 
ease of handling and cost, and nickel-based batteries need to be 
developed primarily for the post-ZEV future." 
  Both the EVX -- which Honda is thinking of commercializing 
in 
the future -- and the (Abeniiru) EV -- for which Nissan is 
planning limited sales -- carry a lead battery. A spokesperson 
from the Third Development Center in Toyota says that "for the 
time being, our main effort will be focused on performance 
improvement for lead batteries, such as low-temperature 
performance and life" for electric vehicles. 
  Low-pollution vehicles, including electric and hybrid cars, 
that use a battery as the source of energy generally cost two to 
five times more than existing cars. According to Nissan's 
Technical Vehicle Development Laboratory, in order to reduce the 
cost of an electric car, "it is critical to lower the cost of 
its exclusive components in addition to the batteries." At the 
same time, it may also be necessary to further develop the 
heretofore nurtured weight reduction technology, so that the 
battery's weight can be easily dealt with in the context of the 
reduced weight of the vehicle. 
<H5>  Hybrid Electric Car Charges Battery While in Motion </H5>
  Mitsubishi showed off its hybrid electric car, the ESR, for 
its low fuel consumption and low pollution. This electric car 
carries a compact generator operated by a gasoline engine for 
the purpose of charging the battery. 
  When the battery is sufficiently charged, the car is driven 
by currents from the battery. However, when the capacity of the 
battery becomes low, the generator is actuated to charge the 
battery without the car stopping. This is called the series 
hybrid method, for "hybrid-operating" the car while its battery 
is being charged. The engine for driving the generator is driven 
at a constant revolution that is extremely efficient and 
generates the least emission per output. The idea behind the 
development of the ESR was that, "by installing the generator as 
the power source, less transmission loss can be encountered than 
with power transmitted from a thermal power plant. Therefore, 
from the overall standpoint, less fossil fuel is consumed and 
less carbon dioxide is generated." 
  Based on that idea, minimization of energy loss was stressed 
throughout the development of the ESR, including the design of 
its body and electric components. For example, in order to 
increase the efficiencies of the motor and the generator, 
silicon steel plates that were 0.25-0.3mm thick and had only 
recently been placed on the market were used for their core 
sections. Those plates can reduce eddy current loss, because 
they are 0.5mm thinner than the existing plates. It is claimed 
that "the motor's efficiency improved by 2 percent merely by 
reducing the plate thickness from 0.5mm to 0.25mm."

<H5>  Joint Operation by Industry, Government and Academia </H5>
  In 1990, Japan's Ultra-High Temperature Materials Research 
Center (UHTMC) was established as the third sector with the 
investments by the New Energy Development Organization (NEDO), 
local public organizations, and private corporations. The Center 
was to operate its business at two locations: Ube City, 
Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Tajimi City, Gifu Prefecture. The 
establishment of the Center was based on the philosophy that 
Japan must "aggressively promote creative technology development 
because technological progress is the moving force an economic 
society needs," although Japan continued to have a dismal 
economic environment after the bubble burst. Furthermore, the 
Ultra-High Materials Research Institute was also established at 
the same time, in the manner usually taken by the private 
sector, in order to effectively utilize the Center's facilities 
and efficiently promote material development. The Institute was 
to support the Center's business and carry out consigned tests, 
research projects, and various exchange projects through the use 
of the Center's facilities. It was July 1992, when all the 
facilities were completely installed and both Center and 
Institute began their operation. Thus, in January 1994, one year 
and seven months have passed since then. 
<H5>  Core of Chubu R&amp;D Circle </H5>
  The Gifu Center, located on a quiet hill on the east side of 
Tajimi City, occupies a section of Tono Research Academic New 
Cities Initiative that is being promoted by Gifu Prefectural and 
local governments. Thus, the Gifu Center is expected to become 
an active, central research facility along with the Nuclear 
Fusion Science Research Institute and the Microgravity 
Laboratory of Japan. In March 1993, the Tono Research Academic 
New Cities Initiative was approved by the government as a 
promotion center regional basic initiative based on the 
multi-polar land decentralization promotion law. Since then, the 
Initiative has been in the process of realizing its long-range 
plan to build a research/academic city that Japan will be proud 
to show the world. 
  The city represents an excellent research environment ready 
for the 21st century with its world-level research facilities 
pursuing pressing environment-related topics, including 
ultra-high temperature, ultra-high pressure, superconductivity 
and microgravity. 
  Under these circumstances, UHTMC is expected to produce 
epoch-making breakthroughs in advanced technology fields through 
the development and implementation of new materials, and the 
breakthroughs are expected to produce broad propagative effects. 
In particular, successful development is anticipated for 
advanced materials that can withstand an ultra-high temperature 
environment of approximately 2,000C, i.e., ultra-high 
temperature materials. Specifically, considered quite promising 
are metal, ceramic and carbon-based materials, as well as their 
composites. When developed, these ultra-high temperature 
materials are expected to be applied in wide-ranging advanced 
technological fields such as aerospace, energy, transportation, 
material-development processes, and environment. Thus, the 
propagative effects of the materials will be felt by all 
industries. 
<H5>  Equipped With Newest Test Facilities </H5>
  UHTMC is equipped with facilities for creating ultra-high 
temperature materials and evaluating the properties and 
functions of these materials at ultra-high temperatures. These 
facilities are so advanced, sophisticated, and high-tech that it 
would be difficult for a private corporation to install them. 
The facilities include research devices such as an ultra-high 
temperature material tester, an ultra-high temperature fatigue 
tester, and a creep tester. In the second half of FY91, the 
business section of UHTMC began operation, and in July 1992, the 
full center began operation. 
<H5>  Also An International Exchange Center </H5>
  Three prefectures -- Aichi, Mie, and Gifu -- in Chubu 
District are creating Tono -- in Gifu, and Suzuka, in Mie 
Research Academic Cities -- whose basic concept is to carry out 
government, industrial, and academic joint national research 
projects; industrial and academic joint research projects; and 
private sector joint research projects. These cities also are to 
function as the centers for international exchange of knowledge 
among the most advanced scientists and engineers of the world 
and are the bases for disseminating technological information. 
Situated between the Tsukuba (on the east) and Kansai (on the 
west) Research New Cities, these Chubu District Research New 
Cities are also growing under an ambitious plan.

  [Text] The material is a perhydro-polysilazane-based, 
inorganic polymer that, when sintered, becomes silicon nitride 
and silicon oxide ceramics. It is easy to mold and machine the 
ceramics, which can be made into fibers, composites, and coating 
materials. 
<H5>  Properties </H5>
  The product is an inorganic material whose main component is 
perhydro-polysilazane, and it is made in microfine powder and 
liquid. Like organic polymers and resins, the product can be 
molded by itself, coated over, impregnated in and mixed with 
another material. When sintered in an inert atmosphere, the 
product becomes silicon nitride ceramics after pyrolysis at 
200-600C. When sintered in air, it is pyrolyzed at 
400C to form amorphous silicon oxide ceramics. The product 
also forms a transparent, high-quality ceramic thin-film when 
coated over glass or metal, dried and sintered. Also, strong, 
elastic, and heat- and acid-resistant silicon nitride fibers can 
be produced by sintering the product made into fibers. The 
product can be impregnated in carbon fibers, which are sintered 
to form fiber-reinforced ceramics with excellent composite 
effect. The ceramics can be used for heat-resistant structural, 
corrosion-resistant, and friction-resistant materials. By 
sintering a mixture of the product with another ceramic 
material, films 10-100 m thick are produced, with 
drastically 
improved strength and corrosion, heat and heat-shock resistance.

  [Text] Ceramics are now in electronic components, including 
IC chips, as well as in consumer products, such as scissors and 
knives. In the future, ceramics are also expected to be used as 
advanced materials in the aerospace and nuclear fusion fields. 
  Recently, a study was initiated to try to develop a ceramic 
engine that has high energy efficiency. With a subsidy from the 
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy of MITI, in FY93, the 
Japan Gas Association (JGA) (President: Hiroshi Watanabe) began 
the five-year "ceramic natural-gas engine system development 
project." JGA intends to develop a natural-gas-burning ceramic 
engine with higher conversion and generation efficiencies than 
previous natural-gas-burning metal engines, in order to conserve 
energy. Natural gas has also been used by co-generation systems 
and gas-engine heat pumps. The ceramic engine, if developed, 
will eliminate the need for water cooling, and therefore, it can 
be made in a compact size to permit usage in congested 
municipalities. Today, from the standpoint of global 
environmental protection, attention is focused on the 
utilization of natural gas, which is considered to be clean 
energy with low NO[.sub]x[/] emission. If implemented, the 
natural-gas-burning ceramic engine will not only promote the 
propagation of co-generation, but will also spur 
natural-gas-burning automobile development, which is already 
under way. 
<H5>  Five-Year-Plan Development by JGA </H5>
  Participants in this research project of JGA include four 
major gas companies -- the Tokyo, Osaka, Toho, and Seibu gas 
companies -- and seven corporations, including Isuzu Ceramics 
Research Institute, Noritake Co., Ltd., and Nippon Shokubai 
Kagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. The total project outlay is approximately 
&yen;5 billion, one-half of which is subsidized by the national 
government. In July 1993, JGA formed the Ceramic Gas Engine 
Development Committee and the Ceramic Gas Engine Development 
Project Section, which is actually to carry out the technical 
development, and it further organized three working groups -- 
Engine Development, Material Development, and NO[.sub]x[/] 
Reduction Technology Development -- within the project section 
to start the project. The development target in the five years 
through FY97 is an engine with a capacity of 200 kW (six 
cylinders), engine drive efficiency of 50 percent (electric 
power generation efficiency of 46 percent), and NO[.sub]x[/] 
emission of 40 ppm (equipped with a denitration device). The 
first year, FY93, for the project will be spent studying natural 
gas combustion, design of energy recovery system, design of 
high-performance materials, design of denitration catalyst, and 
partial test-production of a one-cylinder engine, the basic 
model. 
  Although some of the existing metal gas engines are made 
with 
an electric power output of 5,000 kW, "the ceramic engine to be 
developed will target an output level of 200-500 kW, the popular 
level among co-generation systems," says Tadashi Naruse, 
assistant head of the Ceramic Gas Engine Development Project 
Section, JGA. "Initially, the project team will study the 
single-cylinder engine, and it will eventually combine it to 
make a six-cylinder, 200-kW-output engine that, hopefully, 
incorporates an energy recovery system." 
  In 1978, the U.S. Army and Cummins Corporation first 
suggested that drastic improvement of heat efficiency would be 
gained from a ceramic heat-insulating engine. Immediately 
thereafter, universities and ceramics and automobile makers 
began research, and, at one point, there were said to have been 
10,000 ceramic engine researchers all over the world. However, 
nearly all of them had to give up the research by the second 
half of the 1980s because the strength and reliability problems 
of ceramics could not be solved. Some organizations continued to 
work on the problems, although with reduced manpower. Only a few 
organizations, including the U.S. Army Research Institute and 
Isuzu Motors Ltd., are still continuing full-scale research. 
Isuzu developed a 2,000-cc, light oil-burning engine for 
automobiles and is currently testing the engine. Also, in 1993, 
Kanagawa Academy of Science and Technology developed a 
methanol-burning, ceramic two-cycle engine. 
  Many problems will be faced by the JGA project, which is the 
first attempt to develop a natural-gas-burning, ceramic engine. 
The engine to be developed is supposed to recover the heretofore 
wasted energy as power and emission energy, in contrast to the 
existing engines, which lose approximately two-thirds of the 
energy input as heat losses to emission and the engine cooling 
system (these losses are recovered and re-used in 
co-generation). The ceramic inside the cylinder and the ceramic 
piston will permit high-temperature combustion at 750C 
because of the excellent heat insulation and resistance of 
ceramics. Furthermore, because exhaust gas can be converted into 
power energy by a turbo, the engine's power- and 
electricity-generating efficiencies will be 50 and 46 percent, 
respectively (34 and 31 percent for the existing engines). 
Although the ceramic engine's heat efficiency can be improved by 
increasing its compression ratio to the same level as that for a 
diesel engine, it is necessary for the project to solve the 
following problems: high-temperature combustion technology for 
natural gas; combustion control mechanism; high-efficiency 
recovery technology for heat wastes; NO[.sub]x[/] reduction 
technology; and development of low-cost, high-performance 
ceramic materials. 
  Director Hideo Kawamura at Isuzu Ceramics Research 
Institute, 
where ceramic engines have been studied for nearly 10 years, 
says this: "High-temperature-resistant, ceramic cylinder walls 
are most suitable for the combustion of natural gas, which burns 
easily only at a high temperature." He explains how hard the 
project team is trying to burn "not-so combustible" natural gas 
efficiently. He adds, "We plan to create an air insulating layer 
at the top part of the cylinder to further increase the 
insulating effect. Also, mixed gas does not burn easily at a 
high temperature or under high pressure because the viscosity of 
the gas increases. However, we plan to solve the problem of 
mixed gas by installing an auxiliary chamber in the ceramic 
engine to minimize the fuel pressure increase despite a higher 
compression ratio." 
<H5>  Urea Denitration Used for NO </H5>[.sub]x[/] Reduction 
  In an attempt to reduce NO[.sub]x[/], the project team 
also plans to develop a urea-denitration system exclusively for 
high-temperature exhaust gas, a high-precision ceramic machining 
method, and a normal-pressure sintering, ceramic production 
method. 
  Thus far, despite high expectations, ceramics have not found 
many high-volume applications, except in the automobile industry 
for catalysts, turbo wings, glow plugs, and hot plugs of an 
auxiliary combustion chamber. In the future, in order for the 
ceramics market to grow steadily, automobile applications -- 
particularly auto engine applications -- are said to be the key. 
Thus, aside from energy and environmental problems, research 
institutes and makers worldwide who already gave up the 
development are carefully watching Japan's movements.

<H5>  Conceptualization by Science and Technology Agency </H5>
  Anyone would desire to have materials that can feel and 
memorize changes in their environment, make judgments, and 
respond accordingly. The development of these materials would be 
the ultimate challenge for researchers. In fact, an R&amp;D 
project 
has been quietly under way to produce such materials, called 
"intelligent materials." 
  In November 1989, the Council for Aeronautics, Electronics 
and Other Advanced Technologies of the Science and Technology 
Agency (STA), compiled a report titled "Promotion of General 
R&amp;D 
Concerning Development of New Substances and Materials Capable 
of Manifesting Functions by Intelligently Responding to 
Environmental Conditions" (Advisory No. 13 to Director-General 
of STA). The ground work for the report was carried out by the 
Material Technology Committee and the Intelligent Material 
Subcommittee of the Council, and it took three years for them to 
derive a new concept. In March 1989, in the middle of the report 
compilation, the "International Research Forum Concerning 
Intelligent Materials" was held in Tsukuba Academic New City, 
and the concept was also recognized internationally. In May 
1990, coinciding with the initiation of the STA project, the 
Intelligent Materials Forum (IMF, President: Professor Emeritus 
Toshinobu Takagi, Kyoto University) was established within the 
Society of Non-Traditional Technology. With an emphasis on the 
examination and propagation of intelligent materials, in April 
1992, IMF sponsored the first international conference 
concerning intelligent materials, to ask worldwide researchers 
for cooperation. At the conference, the concept itself, the 
mechanism of intelligent functions, the design (and creation and 
application) of intelligent materials, and fundamental 
technologies were discussed. 
  Three years have passed since the inauguration of the 
project 
and the establishment of IMF, and the concept concerning 
intelligent materials appears to have been recognized not only 
in Japan, but also worldwide. However, it is reasonable to 
expect material development to require a considerable amount of 
time, because it has heretofore never been tried. 
  Discussed below are examples of design approach for the 
concept of intelligent materials that are actually under 
consideration. 
<H5>  Diversified Design Approaches </H5>
  Historically, material development began with materials 
themselves, which were made into structural materials. 
Structural materials first became passive functional materials, 
such as wear-resistant, friction-resistant, and 
high-temperature-resistant materials, and then became materials 
with active functions. Various approaches are under 
consideration for designing intelligent materials from the 
above-described historical viewpoint, i.e, the manifestation of 
artificial intelligence at a material level; creation of 
intelligent materials from the standpoint of material design; 
incorporation of software functions into materials; creation of 
materials approaching humans; and creation of materials 
possessing the time base. 
  Here, the particular key points are the "dynamic" functions, 
such as auto-restoration, auto-learning, life prediction, and 
auto-decomposition, that are automatically altered in 
correspondence with exterior stimuli and the time base. 
  For example, the phenomenon of rust formation on metal can 
be 
considered to be an auto-diagnostic function, and shape-memory 
alloys can be defined as materials with a time-base function. 
However, neither metal nor shape-memory alloys have sufficient 
functions to be called intelligent materials. 
  On the other hand, there are materials that hint at the 
steady progress of R&amp;D toward the creation of intelligent 
materials: an insecticide that predicts the end of its 
effectiveness by changing its color, and a biodegradable plastic 
material that automatically breaks down when a certain period of 
time elapses after being buried in ground. 
  Among R&amp;D targets in the field of structural materials, 
there 
are materials that communicate the imminence of the end of their 
lives or abnormalities before a serious accident through color 
change or noise by diagnosing the deterioration of their 
internal structure and the occurrence of micro-cracks on the 
surface. There are also materials that automatically repair 
their flaws, e.g., by hardening the leading edge of a crack 
through phase transition induced by change in stress, or by 
filling a gap with a molten component. 
  On the other hand, as we pursue development of these 
functions one after another for intelligent materials, the 
materials themselves become so complex that we have to face a 
new problem of how to dispose of them once they successfully 
accomplish their missions. Thus, there is also a trend to 
suggest the development of intelligently functional materials of 
a simple composition. At any rate, there seems to be no doubt 
that intelligent material development has begun with diversified 
end uses and shapes. 
  A similar trend is also becoming visible in Europe and the 
United States. In June 1994, the U.S.-sponsored Second 
Intelligent International Conference is supposed to be held in 
Williamsburg, Virginia. Moreover, the next conference after that 
is scheduled to be held in France in 1996. Intelligent 
materials, which were first proposed by Japan and whose concept 
was first created by Japan, are being developed at a steady pace 
with the support of other nations worldwide.

  [Text] Can atoms and molecules be manipulated by human 
hands to create revolutionary materials that have never existed 
before? If so, the technology will spur dramatic progress of 
science and technology to an immeasurable extent. In order to 
develop such technology, MITI's project "Atom Technology" was 
initiated on a full scale. For 10 years, starting in FY92, MITI 
is expected to invest approximately &yen;25 billion into this 
ambitious project, which is being pursued by a group of 
brilliant minds from industry, academia, and government. 
  It may not be merely a dream to have some of the atom 
technology implemented by the early 21st century. 
  Recently, we have seen rapid progress of technologies for 
observing and controlling microregions that have shifted from 
submicron to angstrom level. Already, research papers have been 
published by IBM Corp., NTT Corp., and Hitachi, Ltd., to present 
their achievements, e.g., letters were drawn by moving one atom 
or molecule at a time with a scanning tunnel microscope. 
  This technology is called mechanical probe (technology of 
pulling an atom or a molecule out and putting it back in). The 
principle of this technology is as follows. The tip of an 
ultra-fine needle (probe) is brought in contact with a 
material's surface, and pulse currents are passed through the 
needle to weaken the chemical bonds of the material through 
optical excitation. Furthermore, heat is added to cleave atomic 
bonds, and one atom is grabbed on the needle's tip. The atom is 
moved by the needle wherever desired, and a reverse-polarity 
electromagnetic pulse is applied to the needle to place the atom 
in a specific hole. 
  Another recently developed technology permits one to pull 
out 
one atom from a material, by irradiating an electron beam, and 
then attach the atom in a targeted site. However, these 
technologies are no more than research tools, and further 
technological revolution is necessary for exceeding the limits 
of existing technologies to industrialize material synthesis 
technology. 
  The aforementioned project of MITI aims at the development 
of 
next-generation common key technologies that are expected to 
spur fantastic growth of various industries, including the 
chemical, biotechnological, and electronic industries. 
Therefore, the project plans to try to fuse various 
technologies, such as the mechanical probe and laser 
technologies, and to seek brand new technologies based on ideas 
completely different from traditional ones. 
<H5>  Fusion of All Possible Technologies </H5>
  The MITI project consists of four major branches: (1) 
solid-surface atom, molecule observation and manipulation 
technology; (2) spatial atom aggregation observation and 
manipulation technology; (3) organic molecule structure 
observation and manipulation technology; and (4) atom, molecule 
process theoretical technology. 
  The development objectives of the solid-surface atom, 
molecule observation and manipulation technology are to 
identify, observe and measure one atom or molecule on the 
surface of a material under various conditions -- such as 
ultra-high vacuum and high and low temperatures -- and to be 
able to manipulate the atom or molecule. At the present level, 
it is extremely difficult to observe atoms and molecules of 
materials other than electrically conductive materials, whereas 
the new project aims at technologies that can be used for any 
type of material. 
  In addition, under the same section of the project, 
technologies are to be developed to measure (in real time), 
analyze, and control dynamic processes such as chemical 
reaction, etching and surface growth on the surface of a solid. 
  Under the spatial atom aggregation observation and 
manipulation technology, development targets are technologies to 
observe live and control the formation, aggregation, discretion, 
and reaction of atom aggregates in a three-dimensional space. 
Also targeted are technologies to form self-organizing aggregate 
structures made of targeted atomic aggregates by controlling 
their movements and reactions and electron transfers among them 
through the manipulation of a spatial electromagnetic field. 
<H5>  Theory Clarification and Prediction, First of All </H5>
  Under the organic molecule structure observation and 
manipulation technology, technologies are to be developed to 
identify organic molecules, such as biological molecules, and to 
manipulate the chemical bond and electronic state at a specific 
segment within the molecule. 
  Furthermore, these technologies will be used to acquire 
basic 
information for increasing the speed and the precision of 
decoding the base sequence of DNA. 
  In order to develop these ultimate technologies, it is also 
necessary to develop basic supporting technologies, such as 
simulation technologies, for theoretically clarifying and 
predicting the behavior and reaction phenomena of atoms and 
molecules at a surface or an interface. Thus, the plan is also 
to develop a new "theoretical experimental apparatus" by 
combining computers and information processing software. 
  This project has been under way at the National Institute 
for 
Advanced Interdisciplinary Research (NAIR), which was newly 
established by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
in January 1993 at Tsukuba Research Center. The project R&amp;D 
is 
being carried out by researchers from national research 
institutes, private corporations, and universities, all of whom 
work under one roof in a concentrated, cooperative manner; yet 
the participation of these researchers is quite flexible. A 
supercomputer is soon to be installed at NAIR, and other 
facilities and devices are being installed as scheduled. 
  In February 1993, a technical research association called 
Angstrom Technology Research Organization was set up by 30 
corporations, including those participating in the MITI project. 
Those corporations include E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 
Inc.; 
Texas Instruments Inc.; and Motorola Corp., in addition to 
Japan's major electric makers -- Mitsubishi Material Co., Ltd.; 
Kobe Steel, Ltd.; Nippon Steel Corp.; Ebara Manufacturing Co., 
Ltd.; and Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd.

<F P=106> [Interview with Masato Yamano, chairman of the board of the </F>
National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan; first paragraph 
is source introduction] 
  [Text] In rocket development, which began decades ago with 
the introduction of U.S. technologies, Japan has finally reached 
a point where it can claim that its technology is 100 percent 
domestically developed. Although it had problems for a while -- 
particularly in the development of the new two-stage rocket 
engine -- it has succeeded in completing the entire job, 
overcoming technological problems and the handicap of an 
extremely small developmental budget and scanty facilities by 
comparison with other countries. The completion of the job is a 
result that promises an unending future for the space 
developments of this country. Here is a summary of an interview 
with Mr. Masato Yamano, the chairman of the board of the 
National Aerospace Development Agency of Japan (NASDA), on the 
development of the H-2 and its future tasks. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You have just successfully 
completed the long-awaited launching of the H-2 launch vehicle, 
a rocket based on our own technologies. I am sure you are 
thrilled with that huge success, but let me start with asking 
you how you feel right now? 
  Yamano: Honestly speaking, I am greatly relieved. 
The H-2 development project was indeed a crucially important 
project for NASDA that lasted more than 10 years, and its 
objective was to launch a world-class, technologically 
state-of-the-art rocket based on Japan's own technology. This 
year happens to be the 25th anniversary of NASDA, so that gives 
me a greater pleasure to have been able to accomplish it this 
year. With the success of the completion of this rocket, Japan 
has come to be on a par with the leading countries of the world 
in space development, at least in terms of the transportation 
system. We are pleased to close this catch-up era, which lasted 
for a quarter of a century. I believe we are at the threshold of 
an age in which Japan will be able to play a leading role in the 
world. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What was the critical point 
in developing this rocket? 
  Yamano: We decided early on, as a basic direction, 
to develop a new engine called LE-7 -- an engine based on the 
two-stage combustion method, which, by its own right, is a 
cutting-edge technology -- as the first-stage engine and a laser 
gyro as the inertia guidance system to boost the lifting 
capacity to four times that of the predecessor, the H-1. 
Everything went quite smoothly, except for the LE-7 engine. 
  We ran into difficult problems in the development of the 
LE-7. And the critical point was unquestionably the development 
of the LE-7. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: You experienced a 
substantial amount of trouble in the development, didn't you? 
  Yamano: Because of that trouble, we had to 
postpone the launch twice. The first time, cracks were found in 
the turbine blades of the hydrogen turbine pump; the second 
time, the welded portion of the high-pressure piping fractured 
as a result of high thermal stress. We never took any hasty 
actions; we now see that we were right in making those two 
postponements to do the job correctly. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Now that Japan has reached 
the world level in terms of launch-vehicle development with the 
success of the H-2, what do you think that rocket will enable us 
to do in terms of space development? 
  Yamano: First of all, we will have the capability 
of launching a wider range of satellites. For example, we can 
build an enhanced version capable of placing a satellite 
weighing up to 4 tons into geostationary orbit by improving the 
first stage LE-7 engine and the second stage LE-5 engine and by 
adding more booster rocket motors, or we can build a smaller 
version capable of placing a smaller satellite weighing 1.5 tons 
into geostationary orbit by reducing the number of booster 
rockets. Secondly, the H-2 is technically capable of performing 
moon and planet surveys. It will enable us to send a survey 
vehicle to an orbit around the moon or Mars, as well as to bring 
back samples from them. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What is your plan for the 
development of the next-generation rocket? 
  Yamano: What we are pursuing with top priority at 
this point are a space shuttle of our own, HOPE, which is 
scheduled to be completed by the early part of the 21st century, 
and an enhanced version of the H-2, which will enable us to 
launch payloads of up to 20 tons, including HOPE. Also being 
considered at this point are such improvements as making it a 
reusable rocket or providing an apogee propulsion capability to 
its second-stage engine to broaden the vehicle's capability. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Although it has many 
promising features, the H-2 certainly has its fair share of 
problems, doesn't it? 
  Yamano: The biggest problem is that its launch 
costs are among the highest in the world. While we are confident 
that the high reliability of NASDA's rockets is well 
appreciated, we have to work seriously on cost reduction in 
order to offer decent cost-effectiveness and be competitive in 
the market. We have already initiated a study on cost-reduction 
measures. The other problem is that the launch season of the 
Tanegashima Space Center is limited to only 45 days a year and 
is a season split in half -- one half being in the winter, the 
other in the summer. However, we believe we can manage it for 
the time being. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What kind of synergy effects 
are possible as a result of the success of the H-2? 
  Yamano: A large satellite will be launched this 
summer, one that is also based 100 percent on domestic 
technology. If successful, Japan will secure its place among the 
leading countries of the world in terms of both the 
launch-vehicle technology and the satellite technology. 
  NASDA wishes to enhance its space activities in addition to 
its traditional fields of communications, broadcasting, and 
observation. I believe that a success this time will have a 
major impact on the general industrial technologies as well. 
  [Boxed item] 
  It was 7:20 a.m., February 4, and the H-2 rocket rose into 
the dawning sky over the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima 
Prefecture as it made its maiden voyage into space and reached a 
predetermined altitude that ushered this country into an 
unending voyage to the moon, Mars and beyond. The 
liquid-propellant, two-stage combustion engine developed for 
this vehicle that is based on our own technology is at the 
cutting edge and is equivalent to the engines used by the U.S. 
Space Shuttle. 
  The successful H-2 launch was also the first milestone for 
Japan in its quest to be competitive in the rocket business 
among the leading countries of the world and a step toward the 
role as leader of the world. While the professionals claim this 
is only the "beginning of the first step," it is certain that 
the country is entering an immense rocket age and is standing at 
the threshold of the age of large satellites. 
  Moreover, if we succeed in increasing the power of this 
rocket, we will be able to launch an ultraheavy satellite 
weighing up to 4 tons to geostationary orbit, as well as a 
Japanese version of the space shuttle weighing 20 tons. 
  This success in the challenge of the unknown was 
accomplished 
under the tight constraints of a much smaller budget (&yen;270 
billion) and facilities that are meager by comparison with those 
of other countries, and only 15 engines were destroyed in the 
course of the development. That proves the soundness of the 
technological levels of the companies that participated in the 
project.

  [Text] The success of the launch of the H-2 marked a page 
in the history of space development in this country and can be 
called the first step toward the moon and Mars observation 
missions or toward the launch of the Japanese version of the 
space shuttle. It has been 39 years since the University of 
Tokyo succeeded in launching the "Pencil Rocket" as this 
country's first attempt at rocketry. Until now, Japan had been 
largely depending on technology licensed from the United States. 
Now Japan is capable of participating in the international space 
development race with its own technology, which is on a par with 
that of the United States, Europe, Russia and China. 
  The H-2 launch-vehicle project got under way in 1984 when 
its 
development project was authorized by the Space Activities 
Commission of the Prime Minister's Office. The development 
itself actually started in 1986, and the first launch was slated 
for 1991 in the beginning. The object of the project was to 
develop a rocket that would be comparable to the U.S. Titan 
rocket and the European Ariane rocket based on Japan's own 
technology. 
  At that time, Japan had just succeeded in launching the N-2 
launch vehicle and was developing the H-1 launch vehicle. No 
consensus had been reached yet as to the specification of the 
vehicle that was to be the successor of the H-1, and 800 kg, 1 
ton and 1.5 tons were discussed as the possible payloads. NTT 
proposed an idea for increasing the weight of a satellite to be 
launched to geostationary orbit to 2 metric tons from 550 kg 
(H-1). They told the National Aerospace Development Agency of 
Japan (NASDA) that future satellites had to be much larger, as 
they saw increasing needs for larger communication satellites, 
and that was indeed the start of the H-2 project. The H-2 launch 
vehicle thus developed is 49 meters in total length and weighs 
260 metric tons before launch. The main propulsion system 
consists of two stage rockets, both using liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen as propellants. 
  The two stage combustion principle used in the H-2's first 
stage engine is similar to that of the U.S. Space Shuttle and 
the Russian Energiya. That was the key to the overall success of 
the project. The first stage engine, dubbed the LE-7, is a 
highly efficient engine capable of converting every gram of 
propellant carried in the tank into a thrust force. Of course, 
it is not the first Japanese engine to use liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen as the propellants. The LE-5 engine, which was 
used as the second stage engine of the H-1 was based on the same 
principle. With the LE-5, a portion of the liquid propellants 
was vaporized to use its expansion energy to drive the 
turbopump, and the propellant used for driving the turbopump was 
discarded after that, resulting in poor engine efficiency. 
  In the two stage combustion system, which was the key 
development item of the entire project, the gas produced in the 
first stage combustion is used for driving the turbopump. Then 
the propellant remaining after the first stage combustion and 
the propellent pumped directly from the tank into the combustion 
room are mixed and caused to react. As the propellant is burned 
in two stages, it is called the two stage combustion system. 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries developed that turbopump, 
whereas Mitsubishi Heavy Industries developed the main body of 
the engine. 
  The engine generates 86 metric tons (110 tons in the vacuum) 
of thrust at sea level, which exceeds the average sea level 
thrust of 77 tons generated by the MB-3 engine used on N-type or 
H-1 rockets. 
  The engine was the most difficult part of the entire 
project; 
an explosion during the development of the turbine resulted in a 
loss of human life, and yet another explosion during a 
combustion test caused the disintegration of the engine, thus 
forcing the launch schedule to be put off for two years. 
  The development of a launch vehicle is often said to be 
built 
on the number of engines destroyed during the development; the 
fact that they had only two years of delay from the original 
schedule is commendable. 
  The first stage rocket engine is attached to a pair of 
solid-propellant rockets, each of which is packed with a solid 
polybutadiene propellant and measures 1.8 meters in diameter and 
23 meters in length; they provide an additional total thrust of 
about 300 metric tons (159 tons each). This auxiliary rocket was 
developed by Nissan Motor, which is considered quite dependable 
because its long history of rocket development dates back to the 
good old days of the Pencil Rocket. That same rocket will be 
used as the main engine of the next-generation J-1 small launch 
vehicle. 
  J-1 is a small, economical launch vehicle that is scheduled 
to lift the prototype of HOPE, the Japanese version of the space 
shuttle. 
  The second-stage engine of the H-2 is the LE-5A, a modified 
model of the LE-5, which has proved itself as H-1's second-stage 
engine. The engine was modified from the gas-generator system to 
the hydrogen breed-cycle system; it produces 12 metric tons of 
thrust in a vacuum. The fairing, for enclosing a payload such as 
a satellite, was also developed with domestic technology this 
time, although it had been imported from the United States. A 
huge fairing having a total length of 4 meters was developed by 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries, which joined in the rocket 
manufacturing business for the first time. 
  With the success of the H-2 launch vehicle, Japan is 
entering 
its large-rocket era. The H-2 can place a 2-metric-ton satellite 
into geostationary orbit (altitude: 36,000 km), a cargo weighing 
about 10 metric tons into low earth orbit (such as a cargo to a 
space station), a satellite weighing about 5 metric tons into a 
sun-synchronous orbit (altitude: about 700 km), or a satellite 
weighing about 6 metric tons into an orbit with an altitude of 
1,000 km. It will also be able to haul a surveyor weighing 2 
metric tons to the moon or Mars, fulfilling many space 
development dreams. 
<H5>  Improved Functions Provide Competitiveness Against U.S. and </H5>
European Vehicles 
  Moreover, the vehicle's capability can be easily enhanced by 
adding more booster rockets. It will be able to place a 
satellite weighing as much as 4-5 metric tons into geostationary 
orbit. Various versions are also possible. Its capacity is 
comparable to the launch capability of the Ariane IV, which was 
developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1988 and is 
currently operated by Arianespace (2.3 metric tons to 
geostationary orbit), or the capability of the U.S. Titan 3 (2.2 
metric tons to geostationary orbit); the upgraded version of the 
H-2 will have a capability equivalent to the Ariane V (4.5 
metric tons to geostationary orbit), to be tested by ESA in 
1995, or the Titan 4 (same capacity), which is already in 
service. 
  Of course, everything is not rosy in the Japanese space era 
being ushered in by the H-2. The manufacture of each H-2 costs 
about &yen;16 billion; when added to the launch cost, which is 
estimated to be about &yen;3 billion, the total cost becomes 
&yen;19 billion. 
  That is high by comparison with overseas competitors. The 
yen, which was valued at &yen;240 to the U.S. dollar when the 
project started, is now &yen;120 to the U.S. dollar. There is no 
way to compete with the vehicles of other countries that are 
launched at a cost of about &yen;10 billion. Also NASDA's hands 
are tied by the fact that it has only one launch site, and 
launch windows are available only twice a year. 
  However, the cost reduction effort has already begun, and 
there are predictions that a 20-30 percent cost reduction is 
possible through mass production. Also, the operational issues 
that had been postponed until the success of the launch are now 
beginning to be reviewed, so that it is certain that our 
international competitiveness will be re-evaluated soon.

<H5>  Forerunners of Space Science in Japan </H5>
  Japan's rocket development started with a successful 
horizontal firing of the Pencil Rocket, which was developed by 
Professor Hideo Itogawa of the University of Tokyo in 1955. It 
was a solid-propellant rocket 23 centimeters in length and 1.8 
centimeters in diameter and was smaller than a model rocket used 
in competitions. Its range was about 1-1.5 km. It was followed 
by various rockets -- such as Baby, Kappa (weighing 1.75 tons), 
Lambda (9.4 tons), and Mu (over 40 tons) -- which started space 
science in this country. 
  The first satellite made by Japan, Oosumi (23.6 kg), was 
launched by a Lambda-4S rocket, which was a four-stage rocket. 
It made Japan the fourth country in the world to launch a 
satellite -- after the USSR, the United States, and France -- 
but it was in 1970, 13 years after the launch of Sputnik 1 by 
the USSR. Oosumi's main task was the observation of the upper 
atmosphere. It was developed by the Aerospace Research 
Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (currently the Institute 
of Space and Astronautical Science), which was founded in 1964 
and has since been continuously in charge of developing rockets 
for launching scientific satellites. 
  The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was 
founded in 1969, a year before the launch of the Oosumi 
satellite. NASDA's objective was to develop launch vehicles for 
practical uses -- such as launching communication satellites -- 
as opposed to launchers for research purposes. 
  The 1960s represented an era of a spectacular space race 
between the United States and the USSR. In 1961, the USSR 
launched the world's first manned spacecraft, Vostok 1, which 
was followed the next year by the announcement of the start of 
the Apollo Project by the United States and the launch of the 
first American spacecraft, Friendship, manned by Astronaut 
Glenn. The world's first female astronaut, Tereshkova, went 
aloft on a space mission in 1963; whereas the United States 
succeeded in taking close-up pictures of the moon's surface in 
1964 and conducted a docking experiment with Gemini the 
following year. In 1966, the USSR succeeded in effecting a soft 
landing on the moon; and in 1969, Apollo 11 succeeded in placing 
men on the moon. France launched its first satellite in 1965. 
<H5>  N-Type Launch Vehicle </H5>
  Under the circumstances, Japan started to develop its own 
large rockets with the intention of joining those countries. Its 
first attempt was the development of the N-Type launch vehicle. 
In 1969, Japan exchanged an agreement with the United States on 
cooperation in space development. Japan's intention in executing 
the agreement was to make sure that it could launch practical 
satellites. Thus, it started its development of launch vehicles 
based on technology introduced from the United States. 
  What was obtained as a result of the agreement was the 
technology compiled up to and including the Thor-Delta Rocket 
System, which was regarded as a well-proven, highly reliable 
system. Japan built its large rocket technology based on this 
imported technology and proceeded to further development based 
on it. 
  The Thor-Delta rocket had been used for launching 
meteorological satellites such as TIROS and ESSA, geodetic 
satellites such as Navstar, communications satellites such as 
Relay, Telstar, Sincom and Intelsat, and many other satellites. 
<H5>  Construction of Ground Facilities </H5>
  The first launch vehicle complete with the supporting ground 
facility and launch system was the N-1. It was a three-stage 
rocket in which both the first and second stages used liquid 
propellants; it measured 32.6 meters in total length and 2.4 
meters in diameter and weighed about 90 tons. It was capable of 
launching a geostationary satellite weighing 135 kg. The 
propellants were kerosene and liquid oxygen for the first stage 
and hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide for the second stage, and 
they were the same as those used for the Thor-Delta rocket. The 
vehicle was guided by a radio guidance system, in which the 
speed and location of the vehicle were measured by means of a 
radar, and the navigational information based on that 
measurement was sent to it on a radio wave. 
  The N-1 launch vehicle made its debut when it succeeded in 
launching the engineering test satellite Kiku, which was roughly 
a sphere with 26 facets, 80 cm in diameter, and weighed 82.5 kg; 
the N-1 launched a total of seven satellites, including the 
observation satellite, Ume, and the practical communication 
satellite, Ayame. It also succeeded in lifting the country's 
first geostationary satellite, Kiku 2, on 23 February 1977. With 
that success, Japan became the third country in the world to 
launch a geostationary satellite, after the United States and 
the USSR. 
  The successor to the N-1 is called the N-2. The decision to 
develop the N-2 was based on the need to launch larger 
satellites; the N-2 could place a satellite weighing 350 kg into 
geostationary orbit. The guidance system was switched to 
inertial guidance from radio guidance. It is a better system for 
guiding a vehicle along the predetermined flight path that is 
used by most launch vehicles today. 
  In addition to that, its tank capacity was increased, and 
the 
number of solid-propellant boosters was increased from three to 
nine. During its heyday, which lasted from 1981 through 1987, it 
launched eight satellites, including the geostationary 
meteorological satellite, Himawari, the communications 
satellite, Sakura, and a marine observation satellite, Momo. But 
the technologies used on it were mostly imported technologies, 
including most of the components, so that the usage was 
restricted by the United States. 
<H5>  Launch of Large Satellites </H5>
  Amidst those restrictions, the H-1 was the first vehicle 
developed with Japan's own technology for launching large 
satellites. Its key development targets were the second-stage 
engine, which was developed with an eye to using liquid-oxygen 
and liquid-hydrogen propellants for years to come, and the 
third-stage solid-propellant engine. The H-1 had a total length 
of 40.3 meters, weighed about 140 metric tons before launch, and 
was capable of lifting a satellite weighing 550 kg to 
geostationary orbit. 
  The first-stage engine, the MB-3, was also used on N-type 
vehicles, so the key point of the development was the 
second-stage engine. The same type of engine had been developed 
by the United States, the USSR, Europe, and China by then. After 
&yen;160 billion and six years, the H-1 made its debut with a 
two-stage prototype in August 1986. It successfully launched the 
geodetic satellite, Ajisai, and the amateur satellite, Fuji, 
followed by Kiku, which was launched by a three-stage version of 
the launch vehicle the following year. A total of nine H-1 
vehicles were produced. That vehicle played a major role in the 
history of this country's space development by launching, in 
addition to the above, the Sakura, the Himawari, Japan's first 
marine observation satellite, Momo, and the broadcast satellite, 
Yuri, until it completed its product life by launching in 1992 
an earth resources satellite, Fuyo, which is still performing 
its mission today.

  [Text] The space industry has always been fully cooperative 
with the government in space development, which is considered a 
national project. The phrase, "A new step in space operations," 
which was used by the National Space Development Agency of Japan 
(NASDA) to describe the success of the launch of the H-2, can be 
applied to the very situation the Japanese space industry is in. 
The market size of the Japanese space industry is a mere 
&yen;200 billion or so as of FY92. Moreover, the demand comes 
mostly from the government and is nowhere near the market size 
in other leading countries. There are many aspects that are 
beyond the capabilities of private companies, e.g., any given 
project requires an immense investment of funds, long lead time, 
and a huge risk. Despite those seemingly insurmountable 
problems, Japan has made a giant step forward into the space 
business. 
  One top executive of the industry said this: "The H-2 launch 
vehicle was built on the premise that it will be developed on 
domestic technology only, in order to meet the large satellite 
launch needs expected in the 1990s. With this success, it is 
possible that other countries might want to use this vehicle to 
launch their satellites, in addition to various Japanese 
satellites scheduled to be launched. The higher the demand, the 
more improvements that will result in the technology to reduce 
the cost; and the lower the cost becomes, the higher the demand 
will be. 
  "They hope that the H-2 will fulfil those expectations. In 
that sense, the successful launch may be said to have opened the 
first year of the space age for Japan, or a milestone of the 
Japanese space industry, with the vistas of the coming 21st 
century, and it is the cornerstone of future development." 
  The point here is that the wider the space business field 
expands, the better the chances for business development. A 
launch vehicle consists of about 100,000 components. The people 
of the companies, as well as NASDA, who were involved in the 
design and manufacture of those components did everything they 
could to ensure reliability, including extensive process 
evaluations and process witness tests and source checks during 
the entire manufacturing process, ranging from the quality 
control of each component to the entire system integration. All 
those efforts culminated in the successful launch. 
  Some of the companies involved in the development are as 
follows: the fuselage was developed by Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries (MHI) as the principal contractor; the engines, by 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI), as well as MHI; the 
satellite fairing, by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (IHI); the solid 
rocket motor, by Nissan Motors; and the onboard electronics, by 
NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Nippon Avionics, and Mitsubishi 
Precision. 
  The ground facilities that include the launch site 
equipment, 
communication and radio systems, and launch control were 
completed through the concerted efforts of MHI, IHI, and KHI, as 
well as Oki Electric, NEC, and Toshiba. 
  Most of the companies mentioned above participated in the 
development of the two space test devices and systems carried by 
this first H-2 launch vehicle. One of the two test systems 
mentioned here is the Orbit Reentry Experiment (OREX) equipment. 
That experiment is intended for the development of the Japanese 
version of the space shuttle, HOPE, which is expected to be 
launched in the early part of the 21st century. The objectives 
of the experiment are to test whether it can withstand the high 
heat that is created during the reentry into the atmosphere and 
to collect the data for the black-out period, during which the 
radio signal cannot reach the ground, because of the enormously 
high temperatures. 
  MHI assumed the responsibility of principal contractor, 
working with six other suppliers. 
  Another test device is the H-2 Vehicle Evaluation Payload 
(VEP). VEP was launched with the OREX atop the H-2, after which 
it was separated and injected into an elliptical orbit with an 
inclination of about 28.8 degrees, with an apogee altitude of 
about 36,300 km and a perigee altitude of about 450 km. 
  It stayed in orbit for about 100 hours, during which time it 
conducted various analyses such as the evaluation of the 
accuracy of the satellite orbit injection by the launch vehicle 
and the environmental conditions for various pieces of equipment 
during the launch. VEP was developed jointly by Toshiba and IHI. 
  Although it is a national project, each company worked hard 
individually to live up to the full responsibility and 
credibility bestowed on it. Following the H-2's first launch, a 
hoard of satellites -- including the Geostationary 
Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5), the Space Flyer Unit (SFU) 
and the Advance Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) -- are waiting 
to be launched by the H-2, and those satellites are nearing 
completion with the enthusiastic cooperation of all the 
companies involved. The H-2 provides quite an attractive 
opportunity in terms of economic value, as well as in terms of 
its large size and its ability to launch multiple satellites. 
  The environment of the space industry is a rocky road, to 
say 
the least. Although it is a promising frontier for mankind, the 
enormous funds required are blocking the approach. It is an 
undeniable truth that space development is stagnant at the 
moment. Every other country involved -- not just Japan -- is 
having difficulty assembling a large budget for space activities. 
  The United States has developed a detailed policy on 
commercialization in five fields -- i.e., launch services, 
satellite communications, satellite-based remote sensing, new 
materials manufacturing and processing that utilize the space 
environment, and industrial infrastructure in orbit -- to 
promote the commercialization in general. In Europe as well, 
commercialization is being considered mainly in the areas of 
launch services and remote sensing. 
  Russia is offering opportunities for the performance of 
experiments in the space environment on the space station Mir 
and its module Photon, while China has established an agency for 
offering launch services. In both countries, the trend seems to 
be to shift from the government-led systems to the 
government/industry- or industry-led systems. 
  The Japanese space industry has become competitive with 
those 
countries in its success in launching a large vehicle. A 
significant jump is expected in the next step. In order to 
respond to the needs of the industry, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry has begun a study of the 
commercialization of the space development industry. 
  The Space Activities Commission of the Prime Minister's 
Office recently established a forum to prepare for the reform of 
the Outline of Space Development Policy scheduled to be 
implemented later this year. It is certain that the nation's 
eyes will focus again on how further progress can be achieved in 
space development through a concerted effort by the academic, 
industrial, and government circles in the wake of this 
successful launch of the H-2.

<F P=106> [Interview with Takaki Yamada, president of Rocket System, a </F>
launch-services company; first paragraph is source introduction] 
  [Text] With the success of the H-2 launch, Japan is finally 
joining the advanced countries of the world in space 
development. Amidst the expectations for Japan's contribution 
and with the vistas of space transportation in the coming 21st 
century, Rocket System, a company whose main business is launch 
services, is getting ready to function at the full capacity at 
which it was designed to function. The following is our 
interview with Mr. Takaki Yamada, the president of Rocket System. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: It has been a long time 
since you were involved in rocket development as a civilian, 
when you were still with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. How do you 
feel now that the H-2 is successfully launched? 
  Yamada: I was thrilled with it. Ever since the 
project started some dozens of years ago, we have been 
determined to produce the best in the world. Everyone from NASDA 
and the private companies involved in the project faced 
challenges in every area of cost, manufacturing technology, 
quality, and product performance, and we had to remove 
difficulties one by one to get to this point. The rocket prior 
to the H-2 included American designs, but the H-2 is exclusively 
made in Japan, all the way from design and manufacture to 
various tests. I am sure everyone must have felt a great relief 
with the success this time. It is impossible for me to express 
my feelings and emotions with words. Practically speaking, the 
launch not only marks this year as the year of birth for our 
company, but, I think it also marks the beginning of the space 
age for Japan. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: The advanced countries of 
the world in terms of space development are already actively 
involved in the commercialization of the space activities. Can 
we expect the same thing to happen in Japan? 
  Yamada: Satellites are closely tied to our daily 
lives in the areas of communications, broadcasting, 
meteorological observation, etc. Earth observation satellites 
play a major role in global environmental protection as well. 
Geodetic satellites, maritime navigational satellites, global 
position sensing satellites, etc., are ready to be used in many 
fields. Also, the manufacture of new industrial materials and 
medicines in the high-vacuum microgravity environment is 
attracting people's attention, so that these fields will 
increasingly create a need for launch vehicles. 
  The two major fields of commercial utilization of space are 
communications and broadcasting. In addition, space stations 
will be operational by the end of this century. I believe that 
launch services will be more and more active in the future. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Japan's presence in the 
space field will grow bigger, won't it? 
  Yamada: The global point of view is necessary for 
us, since what Japan seeks in space exploration -- which carries 
the immense dreams of mankind and holds boundless potential -- 
is the happiness of mankind as a whole. Thus, it is important 
for us to cooperate with all the advanced countries of the world 
in space development -- i.e., with the United States, Europe, 
Russia and China -- in advancing the horizons of space. 
  What comes to our mind first when we talk about the space 
business is the competition between countries, but the important 
thing for us to do is to cooperate first; the competition may 
come in the next phase. We have to look at space from the 
standpoint of how we can efficiently utilize it for the 
happiness of mankind, and how to make it contribute to earth's 
environment. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: We understand that many 
launches are scheduled, but what are the pending issues? 
  Yamada: Launching requires a huge investment; it 
involves a big risk as well. Therefore, it is practically 
impossible to redo it; an extremely high degree of reliability 
is a must. A continuous effort to improve technology is 
indispensable. Another thing is the cost. For the time being, 
launches are supported by the national budget, and because of 
that, we cannot afford to launch more than a few times a year. 
However, the cost will not come down unless we increase the 
frequency. Therefore, participation in the space market is quite 
important. 
  NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Any other issues you wish to 
discuss? 
  Yamada: We launch once in the spring and once in 
the autumn, with the cooperation of local people. In order to 
increase the frequency of the launches, we must have a more 
extensive negotiation with the local people in order to improve 
the launch environment. There is no question that we, the local 
people, have to buy in, but we must also discuss the issue from 
a broader point of view -- how to utilize space for the benefit 
of mankind and how Japan should contribute to it in the 
international sense. 
  A serious issue for our company itself is how to achieve a 
cost reduction. A cost reduction is essential in improving the 
usage rate. If we can lower the cost 30 percent from the current 
level, or even 50 percent, we can increase the demand 
substantially. I believe that we can reduce the cost if we 
combine everyone's wisdom. We will seek the means of cost 
reduction in both hardware and software areas, including 
production control, quality control, and technology control. The 
company has a great responsibility in getting access to the 
world, the future, and space, and we wish to play an important 
role in the great progress of the space industry.

<H5>  Sketch of Rocket System </H5>
  Rocket System is a private company that provides launch 
services for commercial satellites with the H-2 launch vehicle, 
developed by NASDA. It was established in July 1990 with 
investments from major space-related companies, including 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy 
Industries, Nissan Motor, and NEC. Its paid-in capital is 
&yen;484 million, and it employs about 40 people. 
  Its principal function is to take the technological assets 
created by the R&amp;D activities of NASDA and the companies 
involved in the development of the H-2 launch vehicle and 
develop them into a commercial business. Rocket System will 
provide a complete set of services that are based on the H-2 and 
the TR-1 test rocket and that range from quality assurance, 
production control, and sales to the launch services themselves. 
As for the launch itself, Rocket System subcontracts NASDA, 
which has a lot of experience. Launch services in other 
countries consist essentially of the commercial launches of 
satellites, and Japan intends to enter that business market, 
knowing that it is a late-comer.

  [Text] The H-2 launch vehicle has opened the way to the age 
of large satellites. It will be able to place 2-ton satellites 
in geostationary orbit or 6-ton satellites in circular orbit, 
increasing the payload capacity fourfold all at once. The demand 
for large satellites exists in inter-satellite communications, 
international image transmission and communication, safety 
measures associated with the travel of ships and aircraft, etc. 
Moreover, the H-2 enables the launch of a comprehensive 
observation/monitoring satellite that can collect various data 
that are indispensable to earth observation, such as that for 
global warming, El Nino, the ozone layer, etc. Of course, 
scientific satellites that observe space itself will be 
dependent on this vehicle as well. All the satellites to be 
launched by the H-2 -- to include those launched by all the 
vehicles all the way up to H-2 No. 9 (a total of 10 H-2s are 
slated to be built, including one spare) -- have already been 
scheduled, and all are expected to contribute to progress in 
space development and enrich our daily lives, as explained below. 
<H5>  Vehicle Evaluation Payload (VEP) </H5>
  The first satellite launched by the H-2 launch vehicle was 
the VEP. 
  It was a payload that confirmed that the vehicle indeed had 
the ability to open the way to the large-satellite age. The VEP 
had only sensors to detect its attitude and the equipment, 
batteries, and antenna to send the collected data to the ground. 
  The satellite is a box-like structure measuring 3 x 2 
meters, 
with a height of 3 meters. It has a mockup apogee propulsion 
engine and mockup fuel to simulate the balance of the actual 
satellite. It weighs 2.4 metric tons, which is the same as the 
geostationary type. 
  Toshiba and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI) have 
been jointly developing it since 1988. 
  The development cost was &yen;2.2 billion. The H-2's 
capability was to be judged on the basis of whether this 
satellite could be placed in a geostationary transfer orbit with 
a perigee of 450 km and an apogee of 36,200 km, as planned. This 
flight confirmed that the satellite was indeed placed in the 
transfer orbit. The satellite circled the earth once every 11 
hours or so; its service life expires, as designed, when the 
battery life terminates after about 100 hours (about 10 orbits). 
<H5>  Experimental Test Satellite-VI (ETS-VI) </H5>
  The second satellite launched by the H-2 was the ETS-VI. Its 
objective is to establish the technology for accurate 
three-dimensional attitude control, which is indispensable for 
the communication/broadcasting satellite of the 1990s. In order 
to achieve a precise orbit, the satellite uses Japan's first 
re-firing apogee motor. 
  Furthermore, it is going to face the task of highly precise 
position control and extension of the satellite life to 10 
years. Various technologies that could not be achieved by the 
550 kg limitation imposed on the satellites of the past will 
become possible with the development of this satellite. 
  The parties responsible for the development of the satellite 
are -- in addition to NASDA -- Communication Research Laboratory 
of MPT and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. The basic design 
was completed in 1983, and the manufacturing responsibilities 
were shared by Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, and IHI. The 
total development cost was &yen;41.5 billion. It measures 3 x 2 
meters, with a height of 7.9 meters. When its large, lightweight 
solar array is extended, it measures 30.5 meters in length. 
  When a satellite becomes large, its bus, which is the frame 
on which all the equipment is mounted, becomes too large, making 
it more likely to cause vibrations. 
  Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics are used freely in various 
parts of the ETS-VI in order to achieve the required strength 
without increasing its weight. There are various sensors to 
measure the accelerations and shocks during launch, as well as 
antenna extension, solar array extension, and separation of the 
apogee engine. An ion engine (thruster), the first such hardware 
to be used in the world, and the high-performance 
nickel-hydrogen battery were installed as bus hardware. One of 
the unique features of this satellite is that this 
high-performance bus equipment enabled the use of mission 
equipment weighing more than 660 kg. 
  As for the communications hardware, it includes the Fixed 
and 
Mobile Satellite Communications Equipment, the Laser 
Communications Equipment, the Inter-Satellite Communication 
System, etc. The equipment life is expected to be 10 years, and 
the launch is slated for the summer of 1994. 
<H5>  Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) and Space </H5>
Flyer Unit (SFU) 
  The GMS-5 and the space experiment/observation free flyer 
unit SFU are scheduled to be launched by H-2 No. 3 in February 
1995. GMS-5 is about 2 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters in 
height, and it weighs about 345 kg. It will be launched to 
geostationary orbit to observe the earth with visible-spectrum 
and infrared sensors and to provide meteorological data. The 
images of the earth captured by visible light as well as 
infrared light will be sent to the ground simultaneously every 
30 minutes. The resolution is 1.25 km for visible light and 5 km 
for infrared light. In addition to the collection of 
meteorological information, the satellite is capable of 
detecting distress signals sent out by ships and relaying them 
to rescuing organizations. It is being developed by NEC at a 
cost of &yen;14 billion. 
  The space experiment/observation free flyer unit is test 
equipment that carries the gaseous-phase-growth basic test 
device and the partial model of the exposed portion of the 
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), which will be attached to the 
Space Station in the International Space Station Project. It 
weighs 4 tons, and its main body measures 4.7 meters in diameter 
and 2.5 meters in height; when the solar panels are extended 
fully, it has a width of 24.4 meters. IHI is developing the JEM 
exposed-portion model, while NEC is developing the 
gaseous-phase-growth basic test equipment. Both are being 
developed according to the U.S. NASA specifications and will be 
retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle in the summer of 1995. 
<H5>  Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS) </H5>
  The ADEOS conducts the observations of various phenomena on 
the earth, such as the global warming, the depletion of the 
ozone layer, the destruction of the tropical rain forests, and 
abnormal climates. It is 4 meters wide and 7 meters high and 
weighs 3.5 tons. It is 23 meters long when the solar panel is 
fully extended. 
  It is being developed jointly by Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, 
and Toshiba at a cost of &yen;54.5 billion; it is expected to be 
launched in March 1996. 
  In order to solve the global environmental problem, it is 
necessary to maintain continuous observation of phenomena 
occurring on a global scale, and a satellite is most suitable 
for such a purpose. The ADEOS is equipped with various sensors 
to collect the necessary data. 
  More specifically, it is equipped with eight sensors 
developed by NASDA, the Environmental Agency, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI), NASA (United States), 
and the National Space Development Center of France. This 
satellite will be used also as a global environmental monitoring 
satellite. The satellite will fly a sun-synchronous 
quasi-recurrent orbit that has an altitude of 800 km and recurs 
every 41 days and 100 cycles; its service life is three years. 
  The sensors developed by NASDA make up the Ocean Color and 
Temperature Scanner (OCTS) -- which measures the ocean color and 
temperature, as well as the chlorophyll consistency -- and the 
Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer (AVNIR) -- which 
monitors the tropical forest destruction, the expansion of the 
deserts, and the contamination of water resources and collects 
useful data for land uses and resource exploration. 
  The Environmental Agency provides the Improved Limb 
Atmospheric Spectrometer (ILAS) -- which monitors the ozone -- 
and the Retroflector in Space (RIS) -- which measures methane 
levels via laser. MITI is in charge of the Interferometric 
Monitor for Greenhouse Gases (IMG), which measures the 
atmospheric temperature and heat radiation balance. 
  NASA offers the Scatterometer (NSCAT) -- which measures the 
wind direction in 90 percent of all sea areas without being 
affected by the weather -- and the Total Ozone Mapping 
Spectrometer (TOMS) -- which measures sulfur dioxide, etc., 
generated by volcanoes. France offers a device called POLDER, to 
measure the polarization and directionality of the earth's 
reflectance. These major pieces of hardware are being assembled 
at NASDA's General Environmental Testing Building located in 
Tsukuba City of Ibaragi Prefecture. 
<H5>  Advanced Earth Observation Satellite-II (ADEOS-II) </H5>
  ADEOS-II is a successor to ADEOS, designed to meet the needs 
of continuous earth observation and to detect environmental 
changes as a contribution to the international community. The 
international contribution is particularly important, as it is 
necessary to collect sufficient earth observation data in order 
to succeed in current international projects such as the World 
Climate Research Program (WCRP) and the International 
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme; a development budget of &yen;69 
billion is being negotiated to fund the project. 
  According to the schedule, the satellite will be launched in 
1998. It weighs about 3.5 tons and is supposed to carry 12 
sensors. The Global Imager, which is one of the sensors to be 
carried, is an improved version of the Ocean Color and 
Temperature Scanner. It can measure not only the ocean, but also 
the atmosphere, so that it can survey marine biology cycles, 
forest destruction, desert expansion, aerosol, etc., all at 
once. The Fisheries Agency, the Environmental Agency, the 
Ministry of Construction (land covering map), and the ministries 
of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are all interested in 
the data to be provided by the satellite. 
<H5>  Tropical Rain Forest Measuring Mission Satellite (TRMM) </H5>
  In measuring global change, it is necessary to know 
precisely 
the rainfall and the heat radiation from the ground and to 
collect the data globally. The rainfall in the tropical region 
accounts for two-thirds of the all the rainfall on earth. TRMM 
measures rainfalls and water circulation in this region. 
  To do that, it will carry a rain radar and active-type 
microwave-radiation equipment. The rain radar will be developed 
by Toshiba, and the satellite itself will be constructed jointly 
by the United States (NASA) and Japan. 
  The satellite is to be launched in the summer of 1997 to a 
circular orbit with an altitude of 350 km. It is going to carry 
a sensor to observe thunder and measure its energy. Its weight 
is about 3.6 tons. 
<H5>  Communication and Broadcasting Technology Satellite (COMETS) </H5>
  The purpose of COMETS is to establish the technologies for 
inter-satellite communications and sophisticated satellite 
broadcasting, as well as to develop a new technology for mobile 
communications. NASDA is in charge of supplying the 
inter-satellite communications equipment, the Communications 
Research Laboratory of the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications is in charge of the high-speed mobile 
satellite communications equipment, and both of these 
organizations are responsible for developing the broadcasting 
equipment and the mission itself. The satellite is a box 
measuring 2 x 3 x 3 meters and is 30 meters long when the solar 
array is extended fully; it weighs about 2 tons and is scheduled 
to be launched in February 1997. It is jointly manufactured by 
NEC, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Electric at a cost of &yen;44.2 
billion. 
  The inter-satellite communications are transmitted between 
an 
observation satellite or a space station in low earth orbit and 
a ground station via relay satellite in orbit. It must be 
capable of detecting the satellite and tracking it. Therefore, 
it is going to be equipped with a steerable antenna measuring 
3.5 meters in diameter. The broadcasting equipment is intended 
for developing a technology to enable regional broadcasting. 
<H5>  Engineering Test Satellite-VII (ETS-VII) </H5>
  ETS-VII is a satellite to be launched simultaneously with 
TRMM and is intended to establish the system technology required 
for rendezvous/docking and space robots. Toshiba, Mitsubishi 
Electric, and NEC are in charge of the development. It will be 
launched to an altitude of 550 km. The target satellite to be 
docked with is a box measuring 0.7 x 1.7 x 1.5 meters. The main 
satellite measures 1.8 x 2.3 x 2 meters. 
<H5>  High Resolution Observation Satellite (HIROS) </H5>
  HIROS is capable of conducting observations for the purpose 
of damage control associated with tsunamis, high tide and 
flooding, or city planning and checking forest timber stands. 
  It will have a sensor with a resolution of 2.5 meters so 
that 
it can be used for developing maps with a scale of 1/25,000. The 
satellite is going to be launched in 1999 to a sun-synchronous 
recurrent orbit with an altitude of 700 km. 
  Since it will be able to detect minute changes in an area, 
such as those from land usage change, oil spillage, shore 
erosion, volcanic erosion, etc., it will be effective in 
environmental control and conservation, as well as disaster 
monitoring. 
  One of the key items to be developed is a variable off-nadir 
synthetic-aperture radar; a portion of the total development 
budget of &yen;82 billion is being negotiated.

<H5>  Abstract </H5>
  An isolation management support system has been developed 
for 
the isolation process of the advanced thermal reactor (ATR) 
"FUGEN." The isolation process identifies problems in plant 
equipment during maintenance and requires extensive preparation 
and management. 
  This system was designed to prevent errors from occurring 
during the isolation process, and to reduce labor costs and 
waste, and speed up data retrieval. 
  This system can centrally control the isolation procedure 
and 
the reactor's equipment. It can also display the status of 
individual pieces of equipment on a workstation. 
  This comprehensive and easy-to-use system greatly improves 
the reliability and efficiency of isolation management. 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  With the goal of establishing a nuclear fuel cycle to ensure 
energy for Japan, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation (PNC) is working on technological developments for 
uranium exploration, uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing 
and waste disposal, and on developing next-generation advanced 
power reactors such as the fast breeder reactor (FBR) and the 
ATR. 
  Construction of the Fugen ATR power plant (hereafter, FUGEN) 
prototype[.sup]1[/] began in 1970, and it has operated 
normally since full-scale operation began in March 1979. So far, 
there have been 10 scheduled inspections and a great deal of 
modification and maintenance work. 
  When doing inspection or repair work on FUGEN equipment, 
valves on either end of the equipment to be worked on are shut 
off to isolate the equipment from the system, and power is shut 
off and operating switches disconnected to prevent accidental 
operation of the equipment. This is called isolation. In 
scheduled inspections of power plants, which are required by law 
to be conducted annually, this isolation affects operation and 
many systems in a complex manner, so controlling the state of 
the plant is an extremely difficult task. This involves tens of 
thousands of operations per year, and it takes a tremendous 
amount of labor and time to carry out the various work involved 
in isolation. 
  For this reason, the introduction of a system aimed at 
reducing and accelerating the work and increasing reliability 
was desired. 
  In this article, we will discuss in summary form the 
isolation support system that was developed for FUGEN in 
response to this need. 
  Basic concept study and pilot system development began in 
1983, and the first version of the system was completed and put 
to use in 1988. Subsequently, the system has been used in three 
scheduled inspections; several system performance upgrades have 
been instituted; and user interface was improved by introducing 
the S family workstation in 1992. 
<H5>  Development Goals </H5>
  Isolation 
  Isolation refers to work that is done during facility 
inspection or repair to isolate the equipment being worked on 
from the plant by shutting off valves around the equipment or 
cutting off power. This is extremely important in terms of 
preventing breakdown of other systems, protecting equipment and 
the facility and ensuring operator safety. 
  Figure 1 shows an example of isolation. When pump X is to be 
inspected, valve A, which is upstream of pipes connected to pump 
X, is turned to the "shut" position from the "open" position 
(normal operation). This stops water from flowing to pump X. 
Next, valve B, which is downstream, is turned to "shut" in the 
same way, and pump X is isolated from the plant. This operation 
implements the isolation, and then the equipment to be worked on 
(pump X) can be removed and inspected. After inspection is 
completed, the above steps are reversed to lift the isolation 
and restore normal operation. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-35A>      Figure 1: Isolation </FIG>

  The following are isolation duties, the series of steps 
involved in carrying out isolation: 
  1. Isolation planning 
  2. Drafting of isolation plan list 
  3. Drafting of isolation execution note 
  4. Isolation execution 
  5. Drafting of isolation release note 
  6. Isolation release 
  7. Verification of isolation notes 
  8. Isolation management 
  When drawing up an isolation plan, the range and steps 
involved must be checked for possible interference with other 
isolation plans (in which a different status is planned for the 
same period). Using the earlier example, if pump X must be left 
"on" for another operation, the inspection period for pump X 
must be adjusted so as not to conflict with this operation. 
  The isolation execution note is affixed to the equipment on 
which isolation steps will be taken during isolation execution. 
The note consists of a management number and isolation status, 
so that it is clear at a glance what kind of work is to be done 
on that equipment. This will prevent accidental operation of the 
equipment for other tasks. 
  The isolation release note is carried when doing work to 
return equipment to normal operation and lift the isolation. The 
isolation release note consists of a management number and 
restoration status. Therefore, by comparing the isolation 
execution note and the isolation release note, it can be 
confirmed that nothing was missed or leaked out when lifting 
isolation and restoring the system to its normal state. 
  Possible interference with the isolation of other operations 
must be checked before carrying out isolation execution or 
release. 
  Figure 2 is a conceptual outline of isolation duties. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-36A>      Figure 2: Flow of Isolation </FIG>


  System Goals 
  Isolation duties are relatively easy if few isolations are 
involved, but in cases such as scheduled inspections or planned 
shutdowns, where there are multiple isolations, it takes a lot 
of labor and time for management and for drafting various 
documentation (in a year, several hundred isolation lists and 
several tens of thousands of execution and release notes are 
issued). 
  For this reason, an isolation support system has been 
introduced for FUGEN, with the goal of achieving the following 
improvements by enabling on-line processing of duties extending 
from isolation planning to isolation execution: 
  1. Improve thoroughness of operational management by 
unifying 
isolation data management. 
  2. Rationalize isolation plan by reference to recorded data 
and standard data. 
  3. Reduce isolation duties by automating documentation 
output 
and bar code reading. 
  4. Accelerate access to information by unified management of 
plant-related blueprints and other data. 
  Additionally, for FUGEN, a maintenance management system 
(MMS) has been developed and implemented since 1979, for storage 
and retrieval of record data and maintenance management 
including preventive maintenance and detection of malfunctions. 
Within the MMS, there are management systems for the priority 
isolation duties, such as the operation and breakdown management 
system and the equipment ledger management system, and by 
linking these systems, management of isolation duties from the 
viewpoint of maintenance duties as a whole is possible. 
<H5>  System Composition </H5>
  Figure 3 shows the composition of the isolation support 
system. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-37A>      Figure 3: System Composition </FIG>


  This system is composed of a multipurpose large-scale 
computer M770/6 as the core with various types of terminals and 
workstations linked by local area network (LAN). 
  The system base was built with AIM/DC (advanced information 
manager/data communication) application of M770/6, with unified 
management of various masters. The system also is set up for 
automatic reference to databases such as the operation and 
breakdown management system and the equipment ledger management 
system which are built on the AIM. 
  Isolation execution and release notes are printed on a 
serial 
printer dedicated to documentation, and isolation lists are 
printed on an office printer. Blueprints are printed by plotter 
and Post Script printer.[.sup]2[/] 
  Terminals used in the system can be divided into general 
terminals (such as FM R.VDS[.sup]3[/]) and workstations 
(S-4/2GX). From the general terminals, the isolation support 
system can be used online from a screen using the PSAM 
(presentation service access method). From the workstations, the 
isolation support system can be used online from the diagram 
displayed by the ICAD/SX[.sup]4[/] using the workstation 
library. Access from workstations is accelerated by using 
Informix[.sup]5[/] Online to control various master data 
files. Figure 4 shows a general terminal system use screen. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-37B>      Figure 4: Online Screen </FIG>


<H5>  System Functions </H5>
  The isolation support system is composed mainly of the 
following functions: 
  Isolation Plan Function 
  In processing the isolation plan, the operations, operators 
and period needed for the plan can be retrieved from the 
operational and breakdown management system database by 
inputting the isolation management number. Then, by clicking on 
the symbols in the plant diagram that is displayed by 
workstation CAD, the equipment numbers of the equipment to be 
isolated can be designated in order, and the isolation status, 
etc., is typed in by menu, in the same order as the steps to be 
taken in the isolation work. When using a general terminal, the 
isolation plan is input in interactive format by directly typing 
in the equipment numbers of the equipment to be isolated. 
  Additionally, to carry out the plan efficiently, standard 
and 
past performance isolation data can be referenced and 
incorporated. 
  When registering isolation plan data, the system can check 
for data on times and execution status of other isolation plans. 
At this time, the isolation list is automatically issued as 
well. Figure 5 is a sample isolation list. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-38A>      Figure 5: Example of Isolation Lists </FIG>


  Isolation Execution/Release Functions 
  The execution note or release note will be issued 
automatically when the scope of isolation execution or release 
is designated after typing in the isolation management number. 
The execution note is in the form of a seal, which is affixed to 
a base tag that is tied with string to the equipment. Figure 6 
shows sample execution and release notes. Information from the 
issued notes are treated as records and are used to reserve 
execution times and prevent overlapping with other isolation 
plans. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-39A>      Figure 6: Example of Execution Note </FIG>


  On-site isolation work implemented in accordance with issued 
execution or release notes can be conveyed immediately by 
telephone to a central management room, and the scope of the 
isolation execution or release can be typed in from this 
information, thereby updating isolation data. 
  Additionally, the execution note that is collected after 
isolation release can be checked against the release note by a 
bar code reader for verification. 
  When isolation release is displayed, one can check to see if 
the whole isolation under that isolation management number has 
been carried out. If completed, the isolation data can be stored 
in the system as a record of isolation. 
  Isolation Temporary Release Function 
  If it becomes necessary to temporarily lift isolation from 
some equipment, all isolation management numbers, operations, 
operators and periods involving that equipment are displayed by 
typing the equipment number into the system. 
  The displayed screen will have a column to confirm temporary 
release of isolation, and when a command confirmed against all 
isolation management numbers is typed into the system, a 
temporary release note is issued automatically, the system is 
notified of the temporary release, and isolation information is 
updated. 
  When temporary release of isolation becomes unnecessary, 
isolation information is updated by selecting the command for 
full-scale release or reinstatement. 
  Isolation State Release Freezing Function 
  The isolation state freeze is applied when alteration by 
other operations of the isolation that is currently underway, 
such as an isolation with test conditions, is not desired. 
  The freeze on isolation release has been set up only for 
high 
priority isolations, and is used to ensure that isolation will 
not be released unless the command to lift the freeze is typed 
in. By selecting the isolation management number to be frozen or 
the isolation equipment number, other isolation operations 
involving that equipment can be prohibited. To lift the freeze, 
selection is made in the same manner. 
  Isolation State Management Function 
  When using a terminal, isolation state or operational 
history 
can be searched, displayed, or printed by selecting the 
isolation management number or equipment number. Also, each 
isolation plan or isolation state by plant system is displayed 
visually by change of color of symbols in the plant diagrams 
through workstation CAD. Figure 7 [omitted] is an example of 
state management using a workstation. Symbols that change to 
green indicate that the equipment represented by that symbol is 
"shut" or "off" and symbols that change to red indicate that the 
equipment is "open" or "on." 
  Master File Editing Function 
  Editing of the master file, which manages isolation 
equipment 
data and standard isolation data, can be done efficiently by 
interactive processing. For isolation equipment, data can be 
extracted from the equipment ledger database of the equipment 
ledger management system, and for standard isolation, data can 
be extracted from record isolation data. 
  Diagram Management Function 
  When inputting the plant diagram, pipes and wiring 
configuration can be input automatically in accordance with 
equipment configuration, thus reducing the work of diagram 
inputting. Also, the symbols representing equipment (valves, 
pumps, circuit breakers, etc.) often used in plant diagrams can 
be recorded easily using basic CAD functions. 
  Equipment numbers can be attached to symbols displayed on 
the 
diagram and based on this information, isolation plan processing 
and status management can be carried out with CAD. 
  Additionally, plant diagrams can be output easily by 
selecting the necessary diagram from the diagram table. 
  Backup Function 
  The latest isolation status is transferred to the backup 
computer. Thus the latest isolation status can be confirmed by 
printing the contents of stored data in the backup computer even 
when the system has been shut down. 
<H5>  Results and Problems To Address in the Future </H5>
  The following are the results of running this system with 
FUGEN: 
  1. Unified management of various types of isolations has 
made 
it possible to quickly discover lack of smooth operation and 
human error by checking for interference, and this has helped to 
tighten operational management. 
  2. By using pre-entered data on standard isolations and past 
isolations, it has become possible to plan isolations swiftly, 
and this has helped increase operational efficiency. 
  3. Automatic issuing of execution and release notes and 
isolation lists (total of several hundred thousand notes and 
several thousand isolation lists) and collective verification 
using the bar code reader has eliminated the massive amount of 
writing and checking that has been done until now, and this has 
helped reduce work. 
  4. Unified management of plant diagrams has facilitated 
acquisition of diagrams, and this has helped to accelerate 
operations. 
  As for problems to address in the future, we plan to add the 
following capabilities: Visual display of isolation scope on the 
plant diagram, automatic generation of isolation steps, and 
retrieval of data on other systems from the plant diagram. This 
will further reduce the workload, accelerate operations and 
increase reliability. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  This system has been successful in three scheduled 
inspections since 1988. In April 1992, it received the Science 
and Technology Agency Director General's award in recognition of 
originality and practical use before any other plant. It would 
be gratifying if the results of this system and experience with 
its use can contribute to further improvement of safe and stable 
operation of nuclear power plants. 
  Finally, we express our deep gratitude for the guidance and 
cooperation that we received in developing this system.

<F P=106> [Article by Shingo Matsuoka, Japan Nuclear Fuel Company] </F>
  [Text] The Japan Nuclear Fuel Company was designated a 
reprocessing enterprise by the national government in December 
1992, after three years and nine months of examinations by the 
Science and Technology Agency (STA) (the primary examination) as 
well as the Japan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) and Japan 
Nuclear Safety Commission (the secondary examination) into the 
company's technical capability, safety of facilities, conformity 
with principles concerning the peaceful use of nuclear power, 
etc. In this article, we will verify that the design of the 
Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant ensures an extremely high degree of 
safety and that the effects of accidents, should they occur, 
would be minimal. 
<H5>  I. Foreword </H5>
  In 1980, Japan Fuel Service, Inc., was launched with the 
goal 
of building and operating Japan's first private reprocessing 
plant, with investment from about 100 firms, mainly the nine 
electric power companies and the Japan Atomic Power Company. 
Japan Fuel Service subsequently conducted surveys and studies 
both in Japan and abroad on light water reactor (LWR) fuel 
reprocessing technologies. This resulted in the adoption of 
French technology, which has the best performance record, for 
the main process, and the decision that, for the peripheral 
processes, the optimum would be to combine British, German and 
Japanese technologies (the Japanese technology was developed 
under the leadership of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (PNC)). One advantage to adopting the 
French technology for the main process was that the experience 
with PNC's Tokai Reprocessing Plant, which uses that technology, 
could be used. 
  Meanwhile, in 1985, prefectural and village concurrence was 
given to a request from the Federation of Electric Power 
Companies for cooperation in establishing a nuclear fuel 
recycling facility in Rokkasho-Mura, Aomori Prefecture. 
  In this manner, after selecting optimum technologies and a 
geographical site, a basic design was compiled for the Rokkasho 
Reprocessing Plant with guarantee of safety as the first policy 
principle.[.sup]a-f[/] An application for designation as a 
reprocessing enterprise, which documented siting conditions, 
safety design, evaluation of dose equivalent during normal 
operation and safety assessment, was submitted to the prime 
minister in 1989. Examination (primary) of the application by 
STA, the regulating agency, followed by examination (secondary) 
by the JAEC and the Japan Nuclear Safety Commission, confirmed 
conformity with principles concerning peaceful use of nuclear 
power, technical capability and safety, and in 1992, the prime 
minister designated Japan Nuclear Fuel[.sup]1[/] a 
reprocessing enterprise. This was three years and nine months 
after the application was submitted, and 13 years after the 
company was formed. 
  An application (in several sections) was submitted to STA 
for 
"approval of design and construction methods" to build a plant 
this year. Approval was received for the first application, and 
construction started at the end of April. Operation is scheduled 
to begin in 2000. 
  In this article, we will explain mainly how safety is 
ensured 
even under abnormal conditions, based on the safety design and 
safety evaluation in the documents[.sup]g[/] attached to the 
application for designation as a reprocessing enterprise. 
<H5>  II. Process (Equipment) Summary </H5>
  Before beginning the explanation of safety, we will show in 
Table 1 the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant's reprocessing capacity 
and the range of spent fuel to be reprocessed, and we will use 
the schematic diagram given in Figure 1[.sup]2[/] to explain 
the processes (equipment) based on the PUREX (plutonium and 
uranium recovery by extraction) method. The PUREX method has 
been used and modified for many years in the plants of many 
countries. It was applied at the Savannah River Plant in the 
United States 40 years ago, and it is a technology with a record 
of high safety and reliability. It also has a strong record in 
reprocessing of fuel for power generation. It is an established 
commercial technology that has been used to reprocess more than 
40,000 tons of metallic fuel extracted from gas-cooled reactors 
in Great Britain and France and over 5,000 tons of oxide fuel 
from LWRs in France and Japan.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-42A>      Figure 1: Rokkasho Reprocessing </FIG>


  Now, spent fuel assemblies are cooled for four years after 
extraction from power-generating LWRs, then they are cut up by a 
chopper. The resulting fuel flakes are put into a dissolver and 
dissolved by nitric acid. Uranium, plutonium and fission 
products, as part of this nitrate solution, are sent to the next 
process, the separator-distributor. 
  In the pulse column of the separator, the dissolver in 
liquid 
form (water phase) comes into contact with 30 percent 
TBP/n-dodecane (organic phase). TBP (tributyl 
phosphate) is an extractant and n-dodecane is a 
diluent. Uranium and plutonium have a high affinity with TBP, 
and are extracted into the organic phase, but low-affinity 
fission products remain in the water phase and become high-level 
waste (HLW). Next, the organic phase enters the pulse column of 
the distributor, where a reducer is supplied. Here, plutonium 
reacts with the reducer and transforms into an oxidation number 
that has low affinity with TBP. It, therefore, cannot remain in 
the organic phase and switches to the water phase. Uranium does 
not react with the reducer and remains in the organic phase. In 
this manner, uranium and plutonium are separated. When uranium, 
which is in the organic phase, comes into contact with diluted 
nitric acid in a stripper (mixer-settler), an extraction balance 
reaction shifts it to the water phase side and it is stripped 
into the water phase. 
  The uranium and plutonium solutions come from the 
distributor 
and enter separate refiners. The accompanying traces of 
impurities are similarly removed by the extraction-stripping 
operation. Before extraction, plutonium and uranium are adjusted 
to states that are more easily extracted into TBP, plutonium 
mainly by oxide reaction and uranium by raising the 
concentration of nitric acid. Refining is done twice, but is 
shown only once in the figure to illustrate the process simply. 
  Emerging from the refiners, the uranyl nitrate solution and 
the plutonium nitrate solution separately are heated to make 
them evaporate to a dry state, then they enter denitration 
equipment where the nitric acid base is dissolved until uranium 
trioxide product and mixed oxide (MOX) products--uranium dioxide 
and plutonium dioxide--remain. 
  After concentration, HLW liquid goes through HLW liquid 
storage equipment and is sent through solidification equipment. 
The concentrated waste liquid is put into a glass melting 
furnace along with raw material for glass. This mixture is 
heated to high temperature, dissolved, and turned into an oxide, 
which then is assimilated into molten glass. The molten glass is 
poured into a stainless steel container to cool and solidify. 
The container cover is welded on, making this an even more 
stable, extremely safe solid waste material. 
<H5>  III. Safety Features </H5>
  The reprocessing plant is a nuclear chemical plant that 
separates and refines the elements (not nuclides) in uranium, 
plutonium and fission products by conventional chemical 
operations. Because large volumes of unsealed radioactive 
materials are handled, complete safety must be designed in so 
that there is no effect on the environment during normal as well 
as abnormal operation. In addition to critical safety design 
unique to nuclear facilities, fire and explosion prevention 
designs unique to chemical plants are also important because 
organic solvents are used. There is risk that fire or explosion 
could impair the ability to contain radioactive substances. 
  There are safety features in reprocessing plants that, along 
with safety design, help to ensure a high degree of safety. We 
will explain these features, as follows, because understanding 
them is important to understanding the safety of the 
reprocessing plant: 
  1. Since reprocessing is carried out on spent fuel that has 
cooled for more than four years after extraction from power 
reactors, nuclides with short half-lives will have decayed. Thus 
radioactive rare gases and iodine, which easily leak out into 
the environment, will have decayed and disappeared for the most 
part. At the same time, intensional energy (decay heat) that 
might break down containment barriers will have lessened. 
  2. Although radioactive substances in an unsealed state are 
dispersed to multiple equipment for handling, the volume of the 
substances that are extracted or are subject to other physical 
or chemical reactions is relatively small because the capacity 
of columns and tanks have been designed appropriately. Also, the 
danger of an abnormal situation escalating rapidly and on a 
broad scale is basically slight because these equipment are 
operated at below normal pressure and, in most cases, at mild 
temperatures below 100C. Operations involving harsher 
chemical reactions are not carried out either. 
  3. In an accident, one thing that might affect the 
environment is release of radioactive aerosol (liquid or solid 
radioactive particles suspended in air) into the atmosphere. If 
radioactive solutions or fine particles were transferred into 
the ventilation system in aerosol form as a result of explosion 
or boiling, the amount would be slight, only 10[.sup]-3[/] - 
10[.sup]-4[/] or so[.sup]h[/] when the system is properly 
designed. Even in an organic solvent fire, if radioactive 
substances in the form of aerosol carried by smoke were to get 
into the ventilation system, it would be around 10[.sup]-3[/] 
of combustion volume.[.sup]i[/] Tolerance is designed into 
the high-efficiency particulate filters installed in the 
ventilation system so that they will continue functioning even 
under conditions brought about by an accident, but even without 
relying on these filters, the potential scale of the accident 
will be self-limiting because the transfer of radioactive 
substances into the ventilation system is small and because they 
will be removed by adhesion in the pipe ducts. 
  These safety features, combined with the safety design 
described in the section below, ensure a very high degree of 
safety in the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant. 
<H5>  IV. Safety Design </H5>
  In this section, we will first present the basic plan of 
safety design -- targeting abnormal events that might occur in a 
reprocessing plant -- and explain representative examples of 
design, such as radioactive substance confinement design, decay 
heat elimination design, criticality prevention design, and fire 
prevention design. Next, we will explain defense design against 
external events such as earthquakes and aircraft crashes. These 
safety designs follow the "reprocessing plant safety inspection 
guidelines" established by the Japan Nuclear Safety Commission 
with safety inspections of private reprocessing plants in mind. 
<H5>  A. Safety Design Targeting Internal Events </H5>
<H5>  1. Basic Plan </H5>
  Safety is ensured by adopting the following principles of 
multi-layer defense: 
  (1) Prevent abnormal occurrences by adopting technology with 
demonstrated high reliability, designing tolerance into 
processes and equipment, and selecting appropriate materials. 
(In stages following design, this is done by activities that 
guarantee quality and by operator training and education.) 
  (2) Prevent the spread and escalation of abnormal 
occurrences: There is little danger that such abnormal 
occurrences will escalate rapidly, since reprocessing plant 
operating conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) are mild. 
Thus in most cases, there is ample time for operators to detect 
abnormal occurrences through warning signs and transfer 
processes to a safe state. However, in the prevention of 
accidents with potentially major effects, such as criticality, 
fire and explosions, a highly reliable interlock system will 
ensure safety automatically, when necessary. 
  (3) Ameliorate effects from escalation of abnormal 
occurrences: Every measure has been taken to prevent the 
occurrence and escalation of abnormal situations, but even if a 
situation were to escalate, countermeasures have been 
established to ameliorate its effects so that the general public 
will not be affected seriously.[.sup]3[/] If an abnormal 
situation escalates, the danger arises of release of radioactive 
substances in aerosol form into the ventilation system. A 
countermeasure for all processes, to ameliorate the effects of 
abnormal situations that have escalated, is the designing of 
high-efficiency particulate filters that will function 
unimpaired even under abnormal conditions and will remove 
virtually all of the aerosol and then release it through an 
exhaust pipe with diluting and diffusing effect (see the next 
section, "confinement design"). Countermeasures to ameliorate 
specific effects include criticality prevention measures and 
fire extinguishing equipment. 
  Incidentally, dynamic equipment[.sup]4[/] that provide any 
of the multi-layer defenses and that are important for safety 
are designed with independent and redundant power sources and 
circuits so that safety performance is not impaired if one 
breaks down. 
<H5>  2. Confinement Design </H5>
  We will use Figure 2 to explain the design for confinement 
of 
radioactive solutions as a typical example. Most of the major 
equipment involve chemical processes that use nitric acid. Thus 
the columns, tanks and pipes are made of materials (stainless 
steel, zirconium) that are highly resistant to corrosion by 
nitric acid. Moreover, wetted sections are of welded 
construction for leak proofing. Because the processes use only 
low temperature and pressure, it is almost inconceivable that a 
large-volume leak would occur. Assuming that this did occur, 
however, a stainless steel receptacle for leaking liquid has 
been installed on the cell floor, and along with this, there is 
a detection device with which the operator can immediately 
detect the leak and recover the leakage in another, sound tank. 
The cell is further enclosed in housing. This multi-barrier 
construction makes it impossible for the radioactive solution to 
leak out to the external environment. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-44A>      Figure 2: Confinement Function Diagram </FIG>


  On the other hand, columns and tanks are linked to the 
atmosphere by column and tank exhaust gas disposal equipment 
(their ventilation systems), and the cell and housing are linked 
separately to the atmosphere by their own ventilation systems. 
Because the radioactive substances in solution are non-volatile, 
only a small percentage would enter the ventilation system in 
aerosol form even under conditions caused by an accident, and it 
would be completely removed by high-efficiency particulate 
filters, then released through an exhaust pipe. Since air 
pressure is increasingly lower going from atmosphere to housing 
to cell to columns and tanks, radioactive aerosol will not get 
out directly into the atmosphere even if it diffuses in the cell 
or housing; it will go through high-efficiency particulate 
filters and then will be released through the exhaust pipe. In 
this way the ventilation systems are designed to be a safety 
function that ameliorates effects on the environment, even 
during accidents. 
<H5>  3. Decay Heat Elimination Design </H5>
  Most of the unsealed radioactive substances handled in the 
plant exist in storage tanks -- supply tanks, receiving tanks, 
buffer tanks -- that serve as temporary storage of radioactive 
solutions. Although radioactive solution decay heat is 
relatively low, the most important safety feature of these 
storage tanks is decay heat elimination. Figure 3 shows the 
structure of the concentrated HLW liquid storage tank cooling 
system, which will be explained from the viewpoint of prevention 
of boiling. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-45A>      Figure 3: Configuration of Concentrated </FIG>


  To eliminate decay heat, two independent cooling water 
systems, including power systems, are established and operated. 
In the storage tank, five cooling coils have been installed for 
each system, but the necessary heat elimination actually can be 
done with four coils. Cooling water is circulated by a pump and 
release of heat to the outside is accomplished through an air 
fin cooler. Spares for these dynamic equipment are in place so 
that the cooling capability of the system is not lost even if 
one piece of equipment were to break down. Even if an abnormal 
situation escalates and the cooling capability of one system is 
lost, the remaining system will run and the boiling point will 
not be reached. 
  The external power source receives power through two 
circuits, so there is no hindrance to power supplying even if 
there is an outage on one circuit. To prepare against the 
possibility of outages on both circuits at the same time, an 
emergency diesel generator has been installed for each system. 
Moreover, to improve power source reliability, power can also be 
received from a spare diesel generator. 
  Also, in emergencies, solutions can be transferred to a 
spare 
storage tank that is normally empty. 
  Because of this very tightly designed system, it is 
inconceivable that the cooling capability of the two independent 
systems could be lost simultaneously or that this state could 
continue for a number of hours so that the boiling point would 
be reached. 
  A spent fuel storage pool cooling water system (two-system 
structure) and a general cooling water system have been set up 
which are completely independent from the abovementioned storage 
tank cooling water systems. These can also be used for cooling 
the concentrated HLW liquid storage tank. 
<H5>  4. Criticality Prevention Design </H5>
  Because the plant will reprocess spent fuel that was burned 
at nuclear power plants, there is essentially little danger of 
criticality in equipment that handles spent fuel assemblies or 
uranium. However, each piece of equipment has been designed to 
prevent criticality.[.sup]5[/] As a typical example of this, 
we will discuss equipment used after plutonium mixing and 
separation, where that essential argument does not apply. 
  Safety design (called "total concentration safety 
configuration and measurement control") has been applied to 
control the configuration of columns and tanks through which 
plutonium solutions flow so that criticality will not be reached 
no matter how high plutonium concentration becomes during normal 
operation. Even for columns and tanks through which plutonium 
does not flow during normal operation, safety design (called 
"limited concentration safety configuration and measurement 
control" or "concentration control") has been applied to ensure 
adequate tolerance and non-criticality below a certain 
concentration. Thus the latter criticality safety design becomes 
important if solutions flow from equipment governed by total 
concentration safety configuration and measurements control to 
equipment governed by the other control. Figure 4 explains this 
using the example of the washer (mixer-settler) in the 
distributor. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-022L-46A>      Figure 4: Example of Criticality Prevention Design </FIG>


  As explained in part II, plutonium is stripped into the 
water 
phase in the distributor column. However, a trace of plutonium 
remaining in the organic phase flows to the next step, the 
plutonium washer, along with uranium, where it comes into 
contact with a reducer and is removed to the water phase side. 
The distributor column is "total concentration safety 
configuration and measurement control" equipment, whereas the 
plutonium washer is "concentration control" equipment. If 
supplying of reducer to the distributor column stops for several 
hours, the plutonium may become concentrated and flow into the 
plutonium washer in highly concentrated form. However, an alarm 
is set off when reducer supplying stops, and the operator can 
stop the process immediately or take other safety measures. Even 
if this was neglected and developed into an abnormal situation, 
the malfunction can be observed through multiple neutron 
detectors installed in the distributor column for process 
monitoring, and the operator would have adequate time, even at 
this point, to stop the process or take other safety measures. 
Additionally, an interlock system has been designed to operate 
completely separately from operator response. As shown in Figure 
4, when neutron detectors installed in the plutonium washer 
detect a high count rate that indicates an inflow of highly 
concentrated plutonium, an alarm is set off and at the same 
time, processing is automatically shut down. This interlock 
system's high reliability is ensured by independent and 
redundant power source, gauges, cutoff valves, etc. 
  As described above, there is ample time for operator 
response 
and, beyond that, a highly reliable interlock system has been 
installed. It is therefore inconceivable that criticality will 
occur. 
<H5>  5. Fire Prevention Design </H5>
  A flammable organic solvent is used in the extraction 
process. Fire prevention design is important because, if a fire 
broke out, some radioactive substance might be carried by smoke 
and get into the ventilation system and be released into the 
atmospheric environment. Therefore, the safety design described 
below will ensure that the three conditions required for fire to 
occur ((1) solvent leaking from the container to the cell; (2) 
the solvent not being recovered and heating up to the flash 
point (74C); and (3) ignition of the solvent which has 
reached flash point) will not be fulfilled. 
  As stated in earlier sections, columns, tanks and pipes are 
built to prevent leaks, but should a leak occur, the solvent 
would be recovered immediately and could not be released. While 
there are columns or tanks that heat and use solvents, the 
temperature is limited to 50C and the heat source is not 
near the receptacle for leakage. It is therefore difficult to 
conceive of the temperature of any leaked solvent rising to the 
flash point. No equipment that could be an igniting source is 
placed in the cell, and equipment also are grounded to prevent 
static discharge. This design prevents fires, but on the 
assumption of the possibility of a fire outbreak, fire detectors 
have been installed, there are fire prevention dampers that can 
cut off air flowing into the cell, and gas extinguishers also 
have been provided. 
<H5>  B. Safety Design Against External Events </H5>
<H5>  1. Earthquake-Proofing Design </H5>
  Buildings, systems and equipment (hereafter called the 
"facility") have been separated into three classes (A, B, and C) 
in order of importance from the viewpoint of effect of 
radioactivity on the environment in the event of loss of safety 
capability as a result of an earthquake, and earthquake-proofing 
has been applied in accordance with this importance. Moreover, 
important buildings and structures will be supported by stable 
ground, the Takahoko formation (Neogene-Miocene geologic age). 
  Designation of seismic force for the design and confirmation 
of the stability of the Takahoko formation was based on the 
following survey results: 


    -  Study of documentation on past earthquakes in the area 
surrounding the site. 
  -  Study of documentation on geological 
structure (especially active faults) of the site and surrounding 
area (land and ocean), interpretation of aerial photographs, 
geological ground survey (land) and marine sonic prospecting 
(ocean). 
  -  Survey of geological structure of the site through 
elastic vibration, boring, and test pits; and testing of rocks 
and bedrock of site foundation ground. 


    Facilities in Class A will be designed to withstand the 
strongest earthquake (called "maximum magnitude earthquake for 
design purposes") that the above survey results have determined 
may affect the site in the near future. 
  Class A facilities of critical importance (such as spent 
fuel 
storage facility, system and equipment for concentrated HLW 
liquid storage and cooling systems) are designated Class A's, 
and are designed so that safety capability can be sustained even 
in the event of an earthquake stronger than the "maximum 
magnitude earthquake for design purposes" based on the survey 
results and conceivable from a seismological viewpoint. As for 
the level of that conceivable earthquake, studies were conducted 
on the occurrence of past earthquakes, past activity of the 
faults around the site, and earthquakes caused by the Pacific 
plate sinking beneath the Eurasia plate; and a magnitude 8.25 
earthquake on the border of the plate in eastern Aomori 
Prefecture, which would have the greatest effect on the 
facilities, was presumed for the purpose of evaluation. 
Additionally, although it has been confirmed that there are no 
active faults that might affect the area surrounding the site, a 
6.5 magnitude earthquake directly under the site (hypocentral 
distance 10 km) was also presumed. 
  In addition to withstanding the seismic force determined by 
the abovementioned "maximum magnitude earthquake for design 
purposes," Class A structures are designed to withstand three 
times the static seismic force determined by the Building 
Standards Act. Class B and Class C structures are designed to 
withstand 1.5 times and 1 time that static seismic force, 
respectively. The criteria for design of systems and equipment 
in those classes is 20 percent higher. 
  This sort of earthquake-proofing design precludes the 
possibility that any earthquake of any imaginable seismic force 
around the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant will be the immediate 
cause of a serious accident. 
<H5>  2. Design for Defense Against Aircraft </H5>
  About 10 km south of the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant is the 
Misawa air-to-ground training area, where Air Self Defense Force 
and U.S. Air Force aircraft carry out air-to-ground firing and 
bombing training flights. The airspace over the reprocessing 
plant is in the Misawa special air control district. However, 
the possibility of aircraft crashing into the plant is extremely 
slight, considering the fact that aircraft are restricted from 
flying over nuclear-related facilities, the training flight 
configuration in this area and pilot maneuvers to avoid this 
airspace in the event of breakdown. 
  Nevertheless, considering the unique social environment of 
the site, the general population would be seriously 
affected[.sup]6[/] by an accident caused by an aircraft on a 
training flight which lost engine thrust and glided off-course 
to the reprocessing plant and crashed. Therefore, the plant is 
designed so that there will be no hindrance to ensuring safety 
by appropriately protecting it with strong buildings and 
structures that will prevent penetration and remain sound 
against the impact load of an aircraft. 
  When coming up with the design, evaluation formulas that 
were 
verified for suitability were used, and its adequacy was 
confirmed through crash tests using actual and model engines as 
well as actual aircraft.[.sup]j[/] 
<H5>  V. Safety Evaluation </H5>
  The necessary safety countermeasures are drawn up as 
progress 
is made on the design, and safety assessment means reconfirming 
the adequacy of safety design as a whole by systematic and 
thorough analysis and study of abnormal events. In this section, 
we will explain the selection method and results of evaluating 
design basis events, which confirm that the multi-layer defense 
concept has been adopted appropriately, and site evaluation 
accidents, which are used to judge the adequacy of distance 
separating the plant from the general public. Incidentally, it 
has been confirmed that the design ensures complete safety 
against external events such as floods, earthquakes, and 
aircraft crashes. The content of this evaluation complies with 
the "guidelines for safety inspection of reprocessing 
facilities." 
<H5>  A. Design Basis Events </H5>
  Design basis events consist of "abnormal transient changes 
during operation" and "events exceeding abnormal transient 
changes during operation." The main purpose of "abnormal 
transient changes during operation" is to confirm the adequacy 
of measures to prevent escalation of abnormalities, the second 
level of multi-layer defense, and the main purpose of "events 
exceeding abnormal transient changes during operation" is to 
confirm the adequacy of measures to ameliorate effects, the 
third level of multi-layer defense. 
<H5>  1. Abnormal Transient Changes During Operation </H5>
  "Abnormal transient changes during operation" are equipment 
breakdowns, which are expected to happen during the life of a 
reprocessing plant, and events such as changes in operating 
conditions beyond the normal range, which are caused by operator 
error and which may expand into accidents if neglected. 
  Some events that may cause accidents are substance 
input/output, energy input/output, unusual changes in location 
or routing and loss of external power sources. Table 2 lists 14 
of these changes. For each equipment, system, glovebox, etc., 
that contain radioactive substances, the relevant changes among 
the 14 items were hypothesized, and these were analyzed and 
studied to determine what sort of events would result if these 
changes were neglected. About 600 possibilities were selected as 
abnormal events that might significantly increase the amount of 
radioactive substances released into the environment if measures 
to prevent escalation were not considered.

Transient Changes During Operation"

  Consideration was given to the fact that "abnormal transient 
changes during operation" are events that may occur to the 
extent that they are expected to occur during the life of a 
reprocessing plant, and these possibilities were narrowed down 
to 48 evaluation events. Similar items were merged, and seven 
events were designated as representative events, which are 
listed in Table 3. 



  Table 3: Selection of "Abnormal Transient Changes During Operation" 

Selected Representative Events 

1. Abnormal temperature rise in organic solvent in stripping column of 
plutonium refining equipment (organic solvent fire prevention) 

2. Abnormal rise in temperature of heating steam in concentrated HLW liquid 
boiler (prevention of sudden decomposition reaction of TBP and other 
complexes) 

3. Abnormal increase in concentration of hydrogen in reducing gas in reducing 
furnace of mixed uranium-plutonium denitration equipment (explosion 
prevention) 

4. Abnormal rise in concentration of plutonium in plutonium washer of 
distributor equipment (criticality prevention) 

5. Increase in steam volume in exhaust gas due to drop in cooling capability 
in condenser of concentrated HLW liquid boiler (prevent degradation of 
high-efficiency particulate filters) 

6. Abnormal increase in temperature in reducing furnace of mixed 
uranium-plutonium denitration equipment (prevent drop in confinement 
capability) 

7. External power source loss (prevent increase in volume of release of 
radioactive substances) 


  Evaluation confirmed that the interlock system and other 
escalation prevention measures can safely terminate all of these 
events without escalation of abnormalities. 
<H5>  2. Events Exceeding Abnormal Transient Changes During </H5>
Operation 
  "Events that exceed abnormal transient changes during 
operation" are events that escalate beyond "abnormal transient 
changes during operation" despite the fact that measures have 
been taken to prevent escalation. Their occurrence therefore is 
even less possible. In the selection process, events with an 
extremely small likelihood of occurring that were eliminated in 
the selection of "abnormal transient changes during operation" 
also were considered. Events reported at domestic and overseas 
reprocessing plants and related facilities also were used as 
reference. It was decided that it would not be necessary to 
select as "events that exceed abnormal transient changes during 
operation" events which the design would ensure that the 
operator had ample time to prevent from escalating and for which 
very secure automatic accident prevention countermeasures are 
set up. Typical examples of this are boiling in the concentrated 
HLW liquid storage tanks (mentioned in section IV.A.3 on decay 
heat elimination design), and criticality that accompanies 
unusual rise in plutonium concentration in the plutonium washer 
of the distributor (mentioned in section IV.A.4 on criticality 
safety design). 
  As a result of this study, 25 evaluation events were 
selected 
out of 600 possible events.[.sup]k[/] Similar events were 
combined to come up with seven representative events, which are 
listed in Table 4. As a result of evaluation, "criticality in 
the dissolver"[.sup]7[/] was considered the event with the 
most serious effect, and it was verified that the maximum 
effective dose equivalent inflicted on the public in the 
surrounding area would be 0.57mSv, which is below the criterion 
for judging serious effect (5mSv). 



  Table 4: Selection of "Events Exceeding Abnormal Transient Changes During 
Operation" 



Selected Representative Events 



1. Organic solvent fire in cell of plutonium refining equipment 

2. Sudden decomposition reaction of TBP and other complexes in the 
concentrated plutonium boiler 

3. Criticality in the dissolver 

4. Leak to cell from pipes of HLW liquid storage equipment 

5. Leak of molten glass in the HLW liquid glassification equipment 

6. Fall of spent fuel assemblies in the spent fuel receiving facility and 
storage facility 

7. Brief loss of all AC power supply 


<H5>  B. Site Evaluation Accident </H5>
  From a technical viewpoint, "events exceeding abnormal 
transient changes during operation" are the biggest accidents 
imaginable, and there are no accidents that would exceed such 
events. However, considering the magnitude of the potential 
effect due to the large volume of radioactive material being 
handled, the site evaluation accident was hypothesized to be 
anything from "events exceeding abnormal transient changes 
during operation" to "criticality in the dissolver" and "organic 
solvent fire in the cell of plutonium refining equipment," and 
the amount of radioactivity released was hypothesized to be even 
greater, from 10 to 1,000 times depending on the released 
nuclides. It was also hypothesized that all the rare gas and 
iodine generated at criticality immediately would go through the 
ventilation system and be released into the atmosphere through 
the chimney. The result of the evaluation was that the effect on 
the public in the surrounding area would be greatest for 
criticality, 6.1mSv (whole body dose), but this is less than the 
dose of 250mSv, which is used to determine validity. It was 
confirmed that the other evaluation items (tissue dose 
equivalent and collective dose) also met the standards for 
determination. 
<H5>  VI. Conclusion </H5>
  When designs are drawn up, ensuring safety is ranked as the 
most important matter in the performance of operations. Although 
foreign technologies are considered the major technologies, when 
it came to safety, measures that fully reflected Japan's own 
ideas were devised. We are confident that these fail-safe safety 
measures will ensure that no accident will occur that will 
inflict a significant amount of radioactivity on the environment. 
  Apart from the handling of abnormalities explained in this 
article, I would like to touch upon the radioactivity in exhaust 
gases and water released into the atmosphere and the ocean 
during normal operation, a matter of particular interest in 
terms of environmental effect. Certainly, the general public 
dose equivalent from radioactivity emitted during normal 
operation is below the maximum prescribed by law, and the policy 
is to reduce it even lower, based on the ALARA [as low as 
reasonably achievable] principle. As a result, it has been 
assessed that the effective dose equivalent received from 
radioactive emission by the public in the surrounding area would 
be a maximum of 0.022mSv per year. This is about one-tenth of 
the difference in effective dose equivalent from natural 
radioactivity in the Kanto and Kansai areas, about 0.2mSv per 
year (the radiation dose of Kansai area soil is higher because 
it contains more potassium -40, uranium series and other natural 
radionuclides), and it is inconceivable that this will have any 
health effects. 
  Nevertheless, we realize that the general public's trust in 
the reprocessing plant will be earned by its actual operation, 
and we intend to continue to make safety our primary policy in 
the construction, operation and maintenance of the plant and in 
operator education and training, and raise the safety of the 
plant even higher.

concentration control, mass control, and neutron absorber 
control).

  [Text] Since the discovery of an oxide-based superconductor 
in 1986, high-temperature superconductivity research has been 
carried out energetically all over the world. Although the 
once-hot fever has now dissipated, we have recently seen a 
series of achievements in this field. Among them, achievements 
by Japanese teams announced one after another -- including the 
preparation of a superconductive single-crystal thin film and 
the observation of bulk superconductivity at a critical 
temperature of 150K -- are being marveled at by researchers 
worldwide. Japan may soon be leading the world in implementing 
the dream superconductive devices. 
<H5>  30-m-Thick Yttrium-Based Superconductive Thin </H5>
Film 
  In a recent announcement, the Superconductivity Research 
Laboratory (SRL) of the International Superconductivity 
Technical Center (ISTEC) disclosed the successful preparation of 
an yttrium-based (YBaCuO) superconductor's single-crystal thin 
film by liquid-phase epitaxial growth, as a continuation of the 
study concerning the single-crystal pulling (preparation of a 
large single crystal through continuous growth), in cooperation 
with the Nagoya Laboratory and the Fourth Laboratory. 
  The newly prepared, 30-m-thick single-crystal thin film 
showed a critical temperature of 86K from its magnetizability 
after two-hour annealing in oxygen at 500C. 
  Previously, thin films were prepared by deposition from the 
vapor phase, e.g., the sputtering method, and it was difficult 
to prepare single-crystal films. The new method, in contrast, 
uses a comparatively simple device and permits the preparation 
of high-quality films to any desired thickness. Thus, the new 
method is said to significantly contribute to application 
research of devices, clarification of basic properties, and 
establishment of an oxide-based superconductivity theory. 
  On the latest achievement of SRL, Director Shoji Tanaka 
enthusiastically told us: "Despite our having caused a sensation 
seven years ago, we had been unable to achieve any practical 
application because of the lack of material technology. 
Therefore, while the world's attention was focused on ceramics, 
we borrowed the single-crystal pulling technology from 
semiconductors. This time we were successful. However, in order 
to apply single crystals for electronics, we needed to develop 
thin-film technology, especially, homo-epitaxy technology (using 
the same material for both substrate and film), in addition to 
single crystals. In this sense, the successful thin-film 
preparation this time can be a breakthrough to start the 
superconducting device era." 
  The newest single-crystal film was prepared by using the 
SRL-CP (solute-rich liquid crystal pulling) method, which had 
previously been developed to produce large single-crystal bulk 
materials, with a substrate of MgO onto which 
Y[.sub]1[/]Ba[.sub]2[/]Cu[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7-x[/] was 
crystallized from a liquid phase. 
  The experimental apparatus consisted of an electric furnace 
for heating, and a drive mechanism for the substrate. Oxides of 
Y, Ba and Cu were blended at a pre-determined ratio, and the 
blend was pre-baked at a high temperature for 10 hours. The 
pre-baked powder was melted in an yttria ceramic crucible to 
produce a liquid phase. The MgO single-crystal substrate, 10 x 
10[.sup]t[/] x 0.5mm, while being rotated, was brought in 
contact with the liquid phase to deposit a single crystal from 
the liquid phase onto it. 
  The YBaCuO film deposited from the liquid phase onto the 
substrate was confirmed to have c-axis orientation by X-ray 
analysis. The thickness of the film prepared by a 15-minute-long 
deposition process was 30 microns, as determined by microscopic 
observation, indicating the extreme dense structure of the film. 
Furthermore, X-ray reverse Laue photography revealed that the 
film was a single crystal deposited from the liquid phase. 
<H5>  Observation of 150K-Tc Bulk Superconductivity Under </H5>
Ultra-High Pressure 
  About the same time the news on the thin-film preparation 
was 
announced, the three-organization team of SRL, the Second 
Research Laboratory, and the Institute for Solid State Physics, 
Tokyo University, reported that it had observed the initiation 
of the Meissner effect at 149K (Tc[.sup]mag[/]) by a 
mercury-based copper oxide superconductor (Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O) under 
ultra-high pressure. The same sample showed Tc[.sup]mag[/] of 
134K under normal pressure. 
  Thus, the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was increased by 
applying pressure, and the 149K Tc[.sup]mag[/] was obtained 
under 8.5 GPa (equals approximately 840,000 atm). This is 
considered to be an extremely important achievement that hints 
at the possibility of the development of a new superconductor 
with a critical temperature in the vicinity of 150K. 
  The previous highest Tc[.sup]mag[/] for mercury-based 
copper oxide superconductors had been 134K, much lower than the 
temperature observed this time. A spokesperson at SRL told us 
this: "On 10 August 1993, at the International Cryogenic Physics 
Society meeting (LT-20), Professor C. W. Chu, University of 
Houston, reported a Tc of 156K under high pressure of 15 GPa 
(details are unclear as of this writing). The fact that similar 
results were independently obtained by two research 
organizations proves that this substance shows a high critical 
temperature for superconductivity under ultra-high pressure." 
  The superconductor used for the observation of the record Tc 
was a Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O-based material with the raw-material oxide 
powder ratio, Hg:Ba:Ca:Cu, being 1:2:1:3. After blending powders 
of HgO, BaO, CaO and CuO at the above ratio, the mixture was 
molded. The green was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, 
calcined for one hour at 700C, and later subjected to 
post-heat treatment for six hours at 300C in a flow of 
oxygen. 
  As a result of X-ray analysis and high-resolution electron 
microscope observation, the primary phase of this material 
showed an Hg-1223 structure. Direct current magnetizability 
measurements revealed that the material's Tc[.sup]mag[/] was 
134K under normal pressure and that the material was a bulk 
superconductor with a Meissner volume fraction of more than 10 
percent. 
  This superconductor, along with a coil, was mounted on a 
cubic anvil-type ultra-high pressure generator to measure the 
material's AC magnetizability at various temperatures under 
ultra-high pressure below 8.5 GPa. 
  Tc[.sup]mag[/] values determined from AC magnetizability 
values varied with pressure as follows. Under pressure below 6 
GPa, dTc[.sup]mag[/]/dP was large at approximately 2.0K/GPa, 
whereas under pressure above 6 GPa, the slope decreased, 
although Tc[.sup]mag[/] reached 149K under pressure of 8.5 
GPa. 
  SRL explains it this way: "We were able to confirm, through 
the observation under ultra-high pressure, that the Meissner 
volume fraction with nearly the same level of superconductivity 
was maintained under the high pressure as under normal pressure 
(more than 10 percent) and that the material regained its 
initial, normal-pressure characteristics when the applied 
pressure was released. The Tc[.sup]mag[/] might have exceeded 
150K, if pressure of more than 8.5 GPa had been applied." 
  During the first 60 years, since the discovery in 1911 of 
the 
superconductivity phenomenon, the critical temperature increased 
from 4K to only 23.2K. However, since the discovery of 
oxide-based superconductors in 1986, the critical temperature 
(when it exceeds 77K, the cheaper coolant, nitrogen, can be 
used) began to increase rapidly, and now it is almost at 150K. 
  Advantages of superconductivity include the passage of large 
currents without power loss, the exclusion of magnetic force 
penetration to the inside of a superconductor (Meissner effect), 
and the passage of currents through a thin insulator layer 
(Josephson effect). Thus, superconductivity is expected to not 
only increase energy efficiency in an epoch-making fashion, but 
also be applied in many different fields. While energetic 
research is undertaken in many parts of the world, the recent 
achievements in Japan must be extremely significant in spurring 
practical applications of superconductivity, including 
applications in the electronic field.

  [Text] Nagoya -- Tokai Passenger Japan Railway Co., Ltd. 
(JR Tokai), and Japan Railway Technical Research Institute 
(JRTRI) have jointly embarked on the production of the first 
three-car maglev train vehicles to be tested on the Yamanashi 
Maglev Experimental Line as the next step in the 
commercialization of the maglev railway, with an expected train 
speed of as high as 500 km/h. In the spring of 1995, the vehicle 
construction will be completed, and in the spring of 1996, tests 
will begin in order to gradually increase the train speed. 
  The vehicles under construction were designed to be 
lightweight and compact based on technologies developed on the 
Miyazaki experimental line and through the fusion of airplane 
and railroad-car technologies. The vehicles will be articulated 
cars, and two aerodynamic designs will be tested for the train's 
front shape: the "aero-wedge shape" designed by JRTRI, and the 
"double-cusp shape" designed by JR Tokai. 
  Car bodies will be made of an aluminum alloy. The 
superconducting magnet-carrying bogie car -- the heart of the 
maglev car, which transmits levitative and propulsive forces to 
the vehicle -- is also equipped with supporting and guiding 
wheels, which are necessary when moving at slow speeds. The 
braking device is an energy-saving, power-regenerative brake. In 
addition, there is a multiple brake system consisting of 
coil-shorting brakes and power-generation brakes, as a back-up 
to increase safety. 
  In the spring of 1995, the production of vehicles for the 
second train, consisting of five cars, will begin. In FY96, 
tests will be conducted for two trains passing each other in 
opposing directions, and the final decision for 
commercialization will be made in FY98. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., are in charge of manufacturing the 
aero-wedge-shaped and the double-cusp-shaped cars, respectively, 
and Nippon Sharyo Ltd. is building the middle car with only 
passenger seats. The total production outlay is &yen;5.5-5.6 
billion.

<H5>  Successful Pulling of Single Crystal </H5>
  At last, implementation of high-temperature 
superconductivity 
technology appears imminent. A blueprint for a future society 
was supposed to be drawn by superconductivity technology when 
high-temperature oxide superconductivity was discovered. 
Finally, significant technical achievements in Japan, such as 
the success in long-awaited pulling of a superconductor's single 
crystal and the development of technology for superconducting 
thin-film synthesis, are reported to have lifted the technical 
level closer to the level of implementation. 
  In 1993, we saw a great breakthrough in high-temperature 
superconductivity technology. Having successfully pulled 
high-temperature superconducting single crystals, the 
Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL) developed a new 
process to control crystal orientation by applying a temperature 
gradient and achieved a magnetic levitative force of 20 kg with 
an yttrium-based (yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen) superconducting 
bulk material. At the same time, in the private sector, Japan 
Steel Corp. developed a production method for a superconductor 
without any crystalline boundaries and produced an yttrium-based 
superconducting bulk material that also manifested a magnetic 
levitative force of 20 kg. 
  Superconductivity is a phenomenon in which electrical 
resistance becomes zero. Thus, superconductivity permits the 
passage of large currents without loss, and superconductive 
magnets generate extremely high magnetic repulsion to lift 
gigantic objects. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, numerous 
industrial applications have been conceptualized, e.g., 
superconducting magnetic electricity storage systems (SMES) to 
store huge amounts of electric power for power electronics and 
energy fields; linear motor cars and electromagnetically 
propelled ships for new transportation systems on land and sea; 
no-contact belt conveyor systems for distribution systems; new 
medical diagnostic devices based on SQUID (superconducting 
quantum interference device); and superconducting bearings. 
  However, at the time of the discovery of the 
superconductivity phenomenon, the phenomenon was observed only 
in liquid helium, or the ultra-low temperature region of 4.2K 
(-268.8C) or below, which severely restricted application 
and peripheral devices. In 1986, the group led by then-Professor 
Shoji Tanaka, Tokyo University (currently, Professor Emeritus, 
Tokyo University, and Director, SRL), discovered a 
high-temperature oxide superconductor that made it possible to 
use the superconductivity phenomenon at an easier-to-handle 
liquid-nitrogen temperature. Thus, the dream of 
superconductivity implementation was instantaneously broadened. 
  Nevertheless, it was still difficult to develop materials 
that were ready for practical application, and application 
development was progressing in a stop-and-go fashion. However, 
the recent achievements at SRL spurred further development of 
industrial applications of superconductivity. A joint R&amp;D 
project concerning SMES has already been under way between SRL 
and electric power companies; and a bearing maker is reportedly 
on the verge of commercializing a superconducting bearing after 
having successfully test-produced it from an SRL-developed, 
yttrium-based, high-temperature superconductor. 
  At the same time, the successful preparation of thin films 
from a high-temperature oxide superconductor made it possible to 
develop superconducting semiconductors for ultrahigh-speed 
computers, such as Josephson devices. R&amp;D is soon expected to 
accelerate as makers of computers and semiconductors. 
<H5>  Big Contribution to Medicine </H5>
  Superconductivity technology is actively contributing not 
only to the advanced science and technology fields, but also to 
fields that are closer to our daily lives. Superconducting 
magnets containing a superconducting wire coil are used in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices capable of diagnosing 
"sliced" sections of a human body. The usefulness of the MRI 
device in medicine, particularly in diagnosis and treatment, is 
immeasurable. 
  Furthermore, in medicine, SQUID is expected to help in 
clarifying the sophisticated functions and mechanisms of the 
human brain and in diagnosing functional impediments caused by 
cerebral infarction and senile dementia, Alzheimer disease, and 
central nervous system diseases. Recently, a high-quality, 
biological magnetic field measurement system using SQUID was 
developed, and in April 1994, the Superconductive Sensor 
Research Institute is scheduled to start full-scale tests, 
including clinical tests to gather data for practical 
application. 
  Today, the worldwide market for superconductivity 
technology, 
primarily consisting of MRIs and NMRs for material analysis, is 
estimated to be $1.5 billion (&yen;165 billion). This market is 
expected to grow rapidly with accelerated application of the 
recently advanced high-temperature superconductivity technology 
in such fields as new energy, next-generation electronics, 
information/communication, travel and transportation systems, 
and medicine. Thus, the market is predicted to grow to $12 
billion (&yen;1.4 trillion) by the year 2000 and to $90 billion 
(&yen;10 trillion) by the year 2010. Japan is currently leading 
the world in superconductivity R&amp;D and is also expected to do 
the same in practical application development.

  [Text] This report outlines the fiscal year 1993 research 
plans of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) 
research laboratories and discusses R&amp;D-related support 
services. It is being published to provide a deeper 
understanding of the role of AIST laboratories. 
  This is the 32nd annual laboratory research plan published 
by 
the AIST going back to 1962 and is reported to provide the most 
in-depth look at AIST laboratories. 
  Looking back at the previous year, we noted that many 
countries around the world anticipated last year to be a major 
turning point. An international accord was reached at a 
UN-sponsored conference on the issue of environmental protection 
versus economic growth in June in Brussels in which countries 
agreed to work with one another under the banner of "sustainable 
development." Turning an eye toward the domestic front, 
meanwhile, we note that a Five-Year Plan was enacted in June to 
have the standard of living in Japan match that of the major 
powers in the world in terms of building an economy in which 
people experience a real sense of being rewarded for their work. 
This has been the result of both re-examining the 
mass-production, consumer-oriented society that Japan has 
created, and, together with that, recognizing the importance of 
establishing a foundation of growth built on a harmonious 
relationship between the environment and society. 
  Working on that basis, the MITI AIST has produced a 
comprehensive industrial science policy for 1993 that should 
contribute to continued growth and popularity of science and 
technology in Japan. 
  In 1993, in particular, we note the opening of the new 
National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research 
(NAIR), a new research laboratory that promotes joint research 
between government, industry, and academia, between different 
scientific disciplines, and between countries. This year also 
marks the start of the National Institute of Materials and 
Chemical Research (NIMC) and the National Institute of 
Bioscience and Human Technology (NIBH), which were both 
established to attract researchers in relevant fields of 
research to conduct research in the area of substances and 
materials and biotechnology-related fields. In addition, many 
earlier research projects were reincorporated into the 
Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) and 
New Sunshine Project. Besides the radically new R&amp;D project 
system, the agency has been formulating various policies to form 
a three-pillar support structure to promote cooperative 
international research. 
  The agency has also been actively working to increase 
funding 
of the Japan Key Technology Center that was founded to promote 
development of private-sector technologies, and has initiated 
joint private-sector research projects in regional areas such as 
the local Large-Scale Project centered around public examination 
and technology centers that promotes technologies with a local 
character to them, and on standard basic research aimed at 
raising the standard of living in Japan to that of other 
advanced countries. 
  The R&amp;D being done in science and technology in Japan 
has to 
be further consolidated in the future, not merely to sustain 
economic growth in Japan but also to sustain the growth of the 
international economy as a whole, and in that context, AIST 
research laboratories are being counted on to play a major role 
to make this happen. The great expectations being placed in AIST 
research laboratories creates complex circumstances for them to 
operate in, but we believe that it is still possible to energize 
research activities and produce even more outstanding results.

Science and Technology
